1odj5vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CJD/comments/1odj5vf/7_month_journey_so_far/,7 month journey so far,"My father was diagnosed with CJD about 7 weeks ago. We are in England so have been working with the Prion Clinic in London. I think he must have been having symptoms back in April as he phoned me a week before my birthday and when I laughed and said he got the wrong day said he was ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù. 

So I guess if we use April as a marker, we‚Äôre at least 7 months in. He‚Äôs physically absolutely fine. He lost his driving licence the day of diagnosis which he hates but he‚Äôs still working a physical job three days a week, he‚Äôs 74. 

Mentally he‚Äôs struggling, some good days and some bad. He‚Äôs very quiet and on antidepressants. He has bad headaches which they‚Äôve said to take paracetamol and ibuprofen and the occupational therapist has been to visit today and said whatever he needs, whenever he needs can be sometimes be sorted the same day. He‚Äôs not ready for discussions about end of life care as he‚Äôs really just coming to terms with it and hopes it‚Äôs a misdiagnosis. 

It‚Äôs difficult to talk to him about anything medical, he does repeat himself a lot but can still make new memories. He‚Äôs lost his keys a few times and that sort of thing makes him
anxious. He calls himself a zombie because he‚Äôs afraid that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. He has good and bad days but it only takes a small thing to make a good day, a bad day so one day at a time.

He does have trouble making a tea and a coffee or he‚Äôll go into a room and forget what he‚Äôs doing but for 7 months in I think he‚Äôs doing really well. The Prion Clinic assigned him a nurse who we speak to regularly and sometimes text. His neuro consultant will visit in a couple of weeks for a checkup, even his GP called last week and that unheard of! He‚Äôs somewhat of a medical rarity. 

My dad gave permission to find out what type it was so that result is going to take a few months and they are going to determine the genotype to see if it‚Äôs MV or VV which might help prepare but over all, it‚Äôs not been as horrific as I initially thought it would be. I know it‚Äôs going to get much much worse and the slow progression isn‚Äôt going to much help but I just wanted to present maybe a slightly different side of a recent diagnosis.

Thanks for reading if you got his far.

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old Latina born and raised on the North Side of Chicago, looking to meet some new friends, especially fellow girls who are into fun, laid-back vibes.

A little about me: I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm an introvert-extrovert, I love going out and having a good time, but I also fully enjoy chilling at home, rotting in bed, and watching true crime documentaries.

1odj2b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/1odj2b6/sm_and_weddings_your_own/,SM and weddings (your own),"Hey everyone,

So, long story short, my sm onset around 6 years old, and after years and years and years of therapy and pushing myself out of my bubble, I've managed to create a relatively normal life for myself. When it was time to go to college, I decided to apply only to schools outside of the country. This was in part (about 20%) because they were tuition-free, and in part (80%) because I wanted to be able to start a new life in a new place where no one would know me as the girl who can't talk. Before, I could only talk to my mom, my dad, and a few select friends. I couldn't get a word out to my step-mom, step-dad, siblings, strangers, or extended family. Even as I made progress and I became comfortable talking to strangers, I was never able to speak to these family members. I know they have this image of me as someone who doesn't talk, and for some reason that evokes crazy amounts of anxiety and exacerbates my sm.

So, now I'm engaged, and I'll be going back home for the first time since I was 18 (6 years). My fianc√© and I are getting married in my home city, and we unfortunately weren't able to keep our wedding a secret. My whole extended family will be there, as well as my step-parents, and now I'm left dreading what should be a special day. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just to share this with a group of people who might relate. I'm just so overwhelmed, and no one in my life understands sm. They all just think I'm a bit shy and don't like talking to my family. Being around these people makes me feel 7 years old again. I feel tiny and powerless and embarrassed. I'm an adult with an adult job and a whole life on the other side of the world, and this supposed to be a huge milestone, but I don't feel like any of these family members will ever see me as a full, competent adult. It's made even worse by the fact that my mom doesn't understand sm or think it's real, despite every conversation she's had with my therapists and counsellors. She yells at me in front of family members for mumbling, whispering or responding non-verbally, drawing even more attention to the situation, and she makes me repeat myself until she's satisfied I've spoken loudly and clearly enough. It's humiliating and she knows it. I'm an adult and it's *my* wedding, I know, but I can't uninvite her at this point, and I can't address her behavior in the moment. Not in front of people.

To add to the anxiety, my fianc√©'s parents will be coming to the wedding and are insisting on having dinners and coffee dates with me and my family. They've only known me as my current self, and I'm embarrassed for them (and my fianc√©) to see me like that.

I especially hate the idea of feeling like that old version of myself while I'm standing at the altar, starting a new chapter of my life.

He was described as ""disconnected"" and was seen ""not interacting"" with the team or coaches. At one point in the game, he even took a sip of coffee like he was a fan. It was pretty awkward","

During an opening night battle between the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors, the home team was playing without superstar LeBron James.


LeBron missed the preseason with a very specific injury and the Lakers are still awaiting his return. It is unclear when he can get back to action, so in the meanwhile, Los Angeles is led by Luka Donƒçiƒá and Austin Reaves. LeBron is only watching from the sidelines, in street clothes not on the court, as his team begins the season.


However, on the first night of the season against the Warriors, it was hard not to notice the four-time NBA Finals MVP. It was the only time in his career had ever missed the first game of the season.


Watch him on the very far end of the bench on the top left of the screen, sitting next to his son Bronny while wearing a dark suit.


In each of the clips, there is no reaction nor cheering from LeBron. It's just basic stoicism:


Fans noticed his lack of enthusiasm and couldn't help but share their thoughts.


He was described as ""disconnected"" and was seen ""not interacting"" with the team or coaches.

At one point in the game, he even took a sip of coffee like he was a fan.


It was pretty awkward:


It isn't smart to read too much into body language or vibes without knowing the full context.


However, it's hard to fault anyone who felt some of the faces LeBron was caught making seemed a bit concerning:


This is absolutely something to monitor as the season progresses.


Especially if LeBron's injury recovery is longer than expected, hopefully, this isn't a recurring issue.

1odiuos,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1odiuos/the_unblinking_hour/,The Unblinking Hour,"(The rest of the story will be in the comments)

	If there was one thing in this world I hate the most, it‚Äôs moving. The only thing that makes moving sweeter, is when you get to do it in the cold dead winter. However, this was a move that was entirely unavoidable, and frankly way overdue.
Long narrow key marks on my car, broken mirrors, and your two hundred dollar fish getting flushed down the toilet, was my ex-wife‚Äôs way of showing her better side. I would rather have that any day of the week as opposed to the alternative. Dents in the body of my car were always more welcomed than dents in my head, that's for damn sure.

	So I made what felt like the first bold move I‚Äôve ever made in my entire life, and left. I can‚Äôt lie it took some nerve and a tremendous amount of courage. After doing some secretive research at work, I found a decent house for rent about five hours from where I currently lived. Also speaking of jobs, i needed to find a new one of those too. I took some time to arrange a few interviews, and got a call back from the one I was hoping for the most. When I had everything ready, I threw my clothes and other personal belongings into the trunk of my car, and waited for my wife to return home. I wasn‚Äôt going to leave without getting some kind of revenge.

	When she got home, I told her that I had something special planned for us today. An excited expression creeped onto her face when I told her to ‚Äúgo get dressed, we are going out tonight.‚Äù I took her to the restaurant where we had our first date. She didn‚Äôt hold back when it came to ordering anything, and I was the same when it came to the alcohol. After a while she had worked up enough of a buzz, to ‚Äúcasually‚Äù flirt with the waiter right in front of me. The poor guy kept eyeballing me while she felt up on his leg, but I let it go.  After many beverages and hours passed, the time had finally come when she had to use the ladies room. She grabbed her face powder from her purse and excused herself. When she left, I slipped my hand into her purse and pulled out her phone and whatever money she had, and made a swift exit. Dinner was on her tonight.

	Five long hours and half a bottle of aspirin later, I finally arrived at my new home. Although I got here pretty early, I still made it none the less. The landlord said he would meet me here around noon, and currently it was still only around five thirty in the morning. That being said, I should at least get a little sleep in my car while I wait. Surges of what I did last night flashed through my mind while I slept. I felt like a complete bad ass. My nostalgic thoughts were cut short however, from someone tapping at my car window.

	‚ÄúAfternoon!‚Äù I sat up and looked out of my car window. A middle aged chubby man with a neat balding hair cut, and fluffy ‚Äúdad‚Äù stache looked in at me with a smile. My first impression  was if a walrus was turned into a human, this was him. I quickly shook that cartoony image out of my mind and gave him a smile back. The door of my car popped open, as I swung a heavy hungover leg out. ‚ÄúHello Mr‚Ä¶ Banks.. right?‚Äù Between the alcohol last night and the swift planning I had done, I realized I almost forgot his name. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right bud! Nice to meet yoouu‚Ä¶‚Äù The vowel sound that he dragged on also made me realize I still haven‚Äôt properly introduced myself to him. ‚ÄúAh Matthew, but you can just call me Matt.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell Mr. Matt, it's very nice to meet you. Now follow me id like to show you around the place. There‚Äôs a few things you should know since you‚Äôll be staying around here more often heheh.‚Äù A wheezy laugh escaped his lips before he realized that what he said, had no comedic plot whatsoever. He turned around and waddled up the snowy slope of the front yard.

	‚ÄúNot much of a front yard, but there‚Äôs a little flower bed next to the porch if that‚Äôs your thing. That would have to wait till spring though.‚Äù He continued on up the front porch. The house looked decent enough, white panelling on the side and covered with black tiles. The front porch wasn‚Äôt made out of wood, but concrete instead. All together I'd say it‚Äôs a pretty standard looking house. Mr Banks reached into his right pocket and pulled out a hefty ring of keys. He sifted through them for a while before finding the right one. The key inserted the door, and with a gentle twist the door opened. The inside of the house didn‚Äôt resemble the outside at all. Dark oak wood framed each burgundy wall. Each panel of the dark oak was carved with interesting and ornate detail. At the end of each carving there was half of what appeared to be an eye. Each half connected in each corner of the room, to form a full eye. It had just the unique touch I was looking for. ‚ÄúWell here we are Mr. Matt, had a cleaning crew do the floors and walls for you last second. If they missed anything you let me know, I paid those sons of bitches an extra hundred bucks. Let‚Äôs see, just installed a dish washer for you too. The fridge is basically new, and the microwave a bit older. Aside from that I'd say the only thing you might need is a toaster heheh.‚Äù His gut pumped a few times up and down in rhythm with his chuckle. ‚ÄúDamn, feel like I‚Äôm forgetting something. What the hell was it.‚Äù His mustache and bushy eyebrows furrowed towards each other. ‚ÄúEh, can‚Äôt be that important. I‚Äôll leave my card here for you if you‚Äôve got any questions. I‚Äôm not that far away, just the next town over. Just don‚Äôt burn the place down heheh.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks Mr. Banks. Sounds good, anything at all I‚Äôll be sure to call.‚Äù The round man turned heel and waddled down the yard to his car. With a cock of the hand to bid adieu, I was finally alone to tend to myself.

	It has been a long time since I‚Äôve been alone. I had been with my wife for seven years. High school sweet hearts, we pretty much entered adulthood at the same time. So when it came time to learn what being an adult meant, we helped each other as much as we could. The side effects of being an adult didn‚Äôt come until later. We found out she was infertile after we got married. I offered the idea of adoption, but to her it was either we have a baby together or none at all. Eventually I came to understand. What I couldn‚Äôt seem to understand though, was how she became so fond of the bottle. Eventually her vice wasn‚Äôt that noticeable to me. It‚Äôs not that I got used to it, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt care. When I realized I didn't care is when her vice taught her how to lure other men into my bed. After narrowly dodging a murder charge when I caught her the first time, the next few times were a bit easier to deal with. I would come home from breaking my back at work, and sit in the living room while she was screaming her lungs out in our bedroom. When I hit my limit is when I seen my brother walking out of our bedroom. That‚Äôs when I knew I had to leave. Unpacking my last bag of belongings from my trunk, I felt a smile crawl across my face. Finally, a quiet place for myself.

	Noon rolled into evening soon enough. I only realized how late it was when I felt my stomach growl. I fished my phone from my pocket, while my mind gnawed on itself thinking of pizza. Strange enough all the pizza places in this town only had the option to pick up. Which left me to order a pizza from the next town over. It would take a bit longer but oh well, I‚Äôm hungry. With that done, I threw one of my pillows on the floor and plopped down. ‚ÄúI need to get couches soon.‚Äù I thought aloud to myself. I also realized that I‚Äôll have to sleep on the floor tonight. A lighter knock on my door tore me away from my furniture trance. I cracked it open to see an elderly lady standing on my front porch with a cloth covered basket. ‚ÄúHello young man. My name is Beverly. I live just next door. I was hoping to bring you something that you may need, if that would be alright.‚Äù Shit, I wasn‚Äôt really ready for formalities yet. I haven‚Äôt even gotten to sit on my imaginary couch yet. ‚ÄúWow uh, thanks. I‚Äôm Matt. It‚Äôs very nice to meet you Beverly, I just need to finish unpacking everything. I‚Äôll come see you when I‚Äôm done.‚Äù I scooped the basket out of her hand and started to close the door, when something I hadn't seen stopped me. ‚ÄúNow hold it just a second Mr. Matthew, I‚Äôve got something to warn you about.‚Äù The old lady's voice muffled against the other side of the door, and through the crack that remained to the outside. I looked down and saw she had wedged the tip of her metal cane through my door the last second before I closed it all the way. My face pulled into a grimace, before I reset it into a friendly face and pulled the door open. ‚ÄúNow listen to me young man. I am only going to tell you once, because if you don‚Äôt listen then it won‚Äôt matter anyway. You‚Äôre new here and don‚Äôt know anything about this place.‚Äù Beverly said, more serious and a bit sour too. 

	‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived in this town my entire life. I‚Äôm used to how things work around here, but to an outsider like you, you wouldn‚Äôt last a day. That basket should have enough things to help you the rest of the week. I suggest that this weekend you go stock back up on everything.‚Äù I lifted my finger into the air to momentarily cut her off. She lifted her cane up to push it back down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not finished yet Mr. Matthew, don‚Äôt interrupt me.‚Äù Letting a forecast of frustration leave my nostrils, i crossed my arms and continued to listen. ‚ÄúNow for the important details. Tonight, early in the morning. At 2:30 precise, followed by 2:45, and the followed by 2:55 until it reaches 3:00, there will be an alarm that will sound. If you are asleep, then you need to wake up. I suggest going to bed a little bit early. This is the most imperative thing above all else. When the clock hits 3:00 you must.. not.. blink. You mustn‚Äôt blink for an entire hour. All the way until 4:00. Do i make myself clear?‚Äù When she finished talking is when i realized my mouth was hanging wide open. I waited to say anything to see if she would start laughing but she didn‚Äôt. Instead, she stood there with a shaking eyebrow staring at me. ‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù I said, not really knowing how to follow her performance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being serious Mr. Matthew. If you want to see tomorrow you need to follow my instructions. This town has always had this rule. Obviously that fat fuck Lenny Banks didn‚Äôt warn you. He‚Äôs just looking to get paid. He doesn‚Äôt care who moves in here or what happens to them. So heed my warning young man. Come 3:00, DO.. NOT.. BLINK.. until 4:00. Understand?‚Äù I slowly began to nod my head. Her hairy lip quivered in approval. ‚ÄúVery good. Now I‚Äôm off to prepare for tonight myself. If you make it until morning I‚Äôll answer any questions you have.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait! Beverly-‚Äú My words were cut short by the back of the old ladies hand as she sped walked back to her home. ‚ÄúNo time. See you in the morning Mr. Matthew.‚Äù

	Stepping back into the living room, I had a hard time believing what I had just listened to. Getting scolded about taking an extra cookie from a granny, was one thing. Getting yelled at about shit I have no knowledge, and still don‚Äôt, by a seasoned veteran of some kind was a complete other thing. I sat back down on the floor and leaned against the wall, and let out a stressed gust of air. Next to me in one of my moving boxes, was a small wooden box. This box was special to me. Originally the box contained things from my childhood. My baby teeth that I gave to the tooth fairy, one of my science fair medals, even the first Valentine‚Äôs Day card I got from my first crush in kindergarten. Now this symbolic box is filled with things that are important to my adulthood. A pack of papers, a bowl, and some fine weed. Cracking open the box, the room quickly filled with the skunk-like citrusy smell of nirvana. I reached in to grab the cloudy bag filled with heavy green nuggets. My fingers searched out the fattest bud and I pinched the tip of it off to inspect the middle. Inside the little bush were clusters of white crystals, intertwined with soft orange and purple hairs. I lifted each hemisphere to each nostril and inhaled. Each side smelled almost like a grapefruit, followed by the smell of terpenes and fresh crops. ‚ÄúFuck yeah, that‚Äôs some good shit. Thanks Reggie.‚Äù I said out loud. I stuffed one half of the bud back into the baggie, and tucked the baggie back into the small box. Pulling out the bowl I have in there, I shred apart the other half and smash it in. The cool ceramic of the bowl rapidly became warm when the flame of my lighter ignited the soft green patch inside. The weed turned from green, to brown, to black, when I cashed the entire bowl in one go. After a few coughing fits, the rush of THC to my brain was exactly what I needed to finally relax, and the perfect way to prepare for my pizza‚Äôs arrival.

	Some time later I woke up to an alarm, nearly blaring my eardrums out of my skull. After the alarm had stopped the unseen speaker rang out, ‚Äú30 till‚Ä¶. 30 till‚Ä¶. 30 till‚Ä¶.‚Äù Before promptly shutting off. Scrambling on the floor I looked around for my phone to see what time it was. The clock on my phone read 2:30. ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I scoffed out. I sat up and fixed my poor posture. That weed must‚Äôve been more potent than I thought. I passed out about ten minutes after that hit. Standing up I walked over to the front door and cracked it open to peak out. Shocked, I looked up and down the street to see every light in every house on. I looked down and noticed a pizza box on the ground, surely cold by this point. When I looked over at my neighbor Beverly‚Äôs house, all of her lights were on, and I saw that she was standing at her front side window staring out at me. Now creeped the fuck out, i pull my door closed. Turning around to lean on the door, something in the corner of my eye snagged my attention. A brown wicker basket with a blue cloth pulled over top of it.

	I pulled the cloth back to reveal an assortment of items from tape to eye drops inside. A little note tucked underneath one of the many bottles of saline read, ‚ÄúThis should help, keep this basket near you, and be ready. There are no second chances. -Beverly‚Äù Okay seriously, either everyone in this town is batshit crazy, or I‚Äôm about to have a seriously fucked up night. Either way I guess it would be stupid to at least not heed some kind of warning. Best to be prepared. One by one I lay each ingredient of ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù out onto the wooden floor. A grand total of 6 bottles of eye drops, 4 rolls of scotch tape, and even 2 bottles of super glue, with a sticky note on them that said ‚Äúlast resort.‚Äù The rest of the basket contained shots of energy supplements. By the time everything was unpacked from the basket the next alarm rang out into the night. ‚Äú15 till‚Ä¶. 15 till‚Ä¶.15 till‚Ä¶.‚Äù Realizing that I didn‚Äôt have much time until whatever was about to happen, I took some time for myself to use the restroom and splash some water onto my face. After the next ten minutes passed, the next alarm went off. ‚Äú5 minutes till‚Ä¶. 5 minutes till‚Ä¶. 5 minutes till‚Ä¶.‚Äù The alarm now constantly declared how much time we all had left. The more I heard it, the more anxiety began to crawl up my legs. I tried to think of anything else I can do to better prepare myself, but I couldn‚Äôt. Then an idea came to me, and a sudden realization dawned on me. I should‚Äôve been practicing. Feeling like an idiot with a light bulb, I closed my eyes for a few seconds and then opened them. ‚Äú1‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 3‚Ä¶ 4‚Ä¶ 5‚Ä¶ 6‚Ä¶ 7‚Ä¶ 8‚Ä¶ 9‚Ä¶‚Äù I managed to make it all the way to 30 seconds before I couldn‚Äôt help it and blinked. ‚ÄúGod dammit‚Äù I unscrewed one of the bottles of saline solution and squeezed a good amount into both eyes. Holding them closed I rolled them around in my head before trying again. I actually managed to make it for about three minutes before I felt confident enough to stop.

	The alarm outside was now repeating that there was only 1 minute left. I could feel my heart beat begin to increase in rhythm the more I thought about it. The alarm began to count down from 30 seconds now. I felt the best thing I could do is keep my eyes shut until it gets to about 10 seconds. Then I would spray my eyes with some more eye drops, roll them around, and prepare for whatever was about to come. ‚Äú10‚Ä¶‚Äù i unscrew the bottle of drops ‚Äú9‚Ä¶‚Äù I squeezed the bottle into my right eye ‚Äú8‚Ä¶‚Äù I squished the fluid into my other eye ‚Äú7‚Ä¶‚Äù I pressed my eyes shut ‚Äú6‚Ä¶‚Äù I roll my eyes around to spread the fluids ‚Äú5‚Ä¶ 4‚Ä¶ 3‚Ä¶‚Äù my heart feels as if it's about to explode out of my chest. ‚Äú2‚Ä¶‚Äù I gather all the strength I have in my body for an incredible challenge. ‚Äú1‚Ä¶‚Äù My soaked wet eyes flick open. The alarm rings one final call out. ‚ÄúDO NOT BLINK‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fucking do this.‚Äù

	When I stood up, I walked over to my front window. I looked and couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. Everybody, in every single house, was occupying every window visible to me. All of them with a blank face, and none of them blinking. Just staring outside of the window. Not moving, utterly still. Very much past the point of creeped out, I step away from the window. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with this town, and i knew that first thing in the morning i was calling that bum ass land lord to get my money back. I wasn‚Äôt sticking around this freak town after today. I checked the time on my phone to find that only 6 minutes had passed. This is torture.

	 Looking around, I start to notice something begins to feel off with my vision. My peripheral  is beginning to distort. The straight lines in each corner of the wall began to slightly curve inward. Sharp stinging began to boil where my eye lids met the sclera. I grabbed the open bottle of drops I had near me and took a deep breath. I needed to carefully drip the liquid into one of my eyes. The clear liquid seemed to alleviate the stinging. Feeling comfort from that, I felt eager to add some more lubrication to the other eye. I lifted the tiny bottle and gave a light squeeze, but nothing came out. I looked and the bottle still had plenty of liquid inside. Frustrated now, I lifted the bottle and gave a more firm squeeze. Whatever obstruction the bottle had previously, gave way at the peak pressure applied from my hand. Saline jetted out of the bottle like a miniature pressure nozzle, and ripped across the surface of my eye. Everything went black for a second, before I realized what had just happened. I blinked.

	 I blinked, but nothing had happened. Nothing bad had happened to me. I felt around my body to make sure I wasn't missing anything or maybe even had anything extra, but there was nothing. Had the deranged fucking people of this town been falling for false superstitions? Maybe a deranged schizophrenic priest told everyone about a so-called ‚ÄúMessage of God‚Äù only to send the people of this town down a spiraling vortex of mass delusion? Questions ripped through my mind, before my ears began to feel an auditory tug. Something behind me, slowly peeled me away from my train of thought. A low rumbling hum vibrated the air all around me. Turning my head toward the source of ominous buzzing in the air, I was horrified by what I saw. In the middle of the front room of the house, stood a column of‚Ä¶ meat? The top and bottom of the tower seemed to stretch all the way from the floor to the ceiling. The middle of the column seemed to be twisted around, resembling something like a rag when you ring it of fluids. However the material of the visceral tower was what shocked me the most. Pulsating meat, with vines of undulating veins and webs of tendons held together the tower of twisted gore. Upon closer and careful inspection, something even more strange stood out to me about the tower. Spiraling up the shaft, were wide stretched folds of flesh with strands of hair protruding along each one. Unthinking in the moment, I blinked again. When my lids flicked open, to my horror one of the folds of skin was different. It was a drooling, bloodshot, glossed over eye. I couldn‚Äôt move. What in the fuck is that thing.

	An alarm blared through the air outside. ‚Äú30 minutes left‚Ä¶. 30 minutes left‚Ä¶. 30 minutes left‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúGod dammit‚Äù I muttered out loud. I managed to look away from this grotesque abomination for a moment, to take a look outside of my window. Looking at the house across the street, I saw that each person standing at each window was now collectively looking at my house. The same goes to each house on either side of that house. I walked over to the side window of the room that faced Beverly‚Äôs house. She too was looking, seemingly right at me. I quickly closed my blinds, and proceeded to go into a state of panic.

	 Turning back around, I was once again facing the tower of meat in the room. I looked at the eye again to see it was straining to look at me with a bloodshot side eye. Calming myself, I began to feel another wave of stinging in my eyes. I grabbed a fresh bottle of saline and cleansed my eyes from the pain. i took some time to really try and study this meaty structure before me. I slowly approached it, and looked closer at it. As I got closer the meat began to flex and twitch. It seemed like it got excited almost. I pulled out my pocket knife, and flipped it open. I lifted the cool metal blade toward one of the muscle-like lumps. The flesh gyrated and convulsed. When the blade made contact, it was swiftly pulled from my hand. I watched in horror as the handle of the blade sunk down into the meat. The humming in the room grew loud, and the entire column grew and shrunk, seeming to pulse. A gaping hole opened and the blade was flung from the hellish structure. My knife flipped through the air and stuck into the wall. While narrowly dodging the object I couldn't help but blink again when I flinched. When I looked at the mass again, I saw that another once closed fold was now open too. The singular eye that looked at me before was not alone now. I noticed that the original eye was blue, and the new one was a deep shade of brown. ‚Äú15 minutes left‚Ä¶. 15 minutes left‚Ä¶. 15 minutes left‚Ä¶.‚Äù Studying this thing, I counted the amount of eye lids it had left. In total it had 2 that were now open and 8 more remaining. 8 more chances to either fuck up, or survive. Despite how horrific this thing was, I needed to lock in and concentrate.

	 Thinking for a moment, I considered a few things. I had 8 chances left. And despite what I‚Äôve been told, I‚Äôve blinked more than once and survived. So even if I mess up again, I think I will be okay. After replenishing my lenses with fresh fluid, I scrunch into a ball on the floor, and stare at the shining tower of meat. The longer i look at it, the more i notice small things about it. Like me, the tower did not blink. Instead the eyes stared at me, and only at me. Strangely enough, I felt the vision of the tower did more than just stare at me though. It‚Äôs almost as if I could feel its vision going inside of me. Like its line of sight was a presence that penetrates my soul. Like when someone says ‚Äúi can ‚Äòfeel‚Äô you staring at me‚Äù but in this instance I could actually feel it. A sharp pain pulsed through my mind, and simultaneously, the pupils of the tower began to expand and shrink rapidly. It‚Äôs like it wanted to tell me something urgent. Like it wanted to help me with something. 

	‚Äú5 minutes left‚Ä¶. 5 minutes left‚Ä¶. 5 minutes left‚Ä¶.‚Äù The alarm blaring outside was muffled to my ears. Because the only thing I could hear now was the tower. As the time grew closer to 4:00 the hum in the room grew louder. And as the hum grew louder, the more entranced I felt. The buzzing resonance sent my brain spiraling around the room, like a rabbit hole to a wonderful land. Sweat ran in formations along the length of my face. ‚ÄúBe with us‚Äù a low whisper said in my skull. ‚ÄúWe love you‚Äù a different voice told me. The voices had been doing this now for a few minutes. Coercing me to give in. The two vocal cords were separate at times, and then twisted together in others. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I managed to mutter out. The tower pulsed, seemingly repulsed by my answer to its pleas. I could tell it wanted to get closer to me so badly. But due to its nerve-like roots that planted it in its vertical position, it proved impossible for it to grow any closer. 

	‚Äú2 minutes left‚Ä¶. 2 minutes left‚Ä¶. 2 minutes left‚Ä¶. ""I felt so drained. At this point I stopped adding the solution to my eyes. The swirling trance I was in stopped me from feeling any kind of pain in my face. The more I paid any attention to my body, the more I realized that I really couldn‚Äôt feel anything at all. Almost as if I was paralyzed. My eyes began to droop a slight amount. I could tell when the top half of my vision began to slowly disappear from my view. I gathered all the strength, and mental fortitude I seemingly had left, to try and open my eyes all the way. It was useless. My eyes closed all the way, and a jolt of pain surged through my brain, shocking my eyes open again. The tower twisted tighter, and relaxed. As the muscles lost tension, a chorus of laughter rippled through the wrinkles of my mind. Inspecting the tower, 3 more of the eyes had opened. My eyes must‚Äôve been closed longer than I had thought.. The sands of time in my perspective had begun to fall sideways instead of straight down. That‚Äôs when I heard the only thing that began to pull my feet back towards the ground. ‚Äú3‚Ä¶. 2‚Ä¶. 1‚Ä¶. 4:00‚Ä¶. 4:00‚Ä¶. 4:00‚Ä¶.‚Äù My eyes fluttered closed, only to open momentarily. The tower was no longer here. It was gone in just a blink of an eye. Feeling the tension release me, and voices evaporate from my mind, I let my body go limp into the wooden floor, and I fell asleep.

	My eyes open in a beam of sunshine, creeping through my window. The sound of scraping, and children playing resonated from outside. My head felt worse than any hangover I‚Äôve ever had. Pins and needles rattled in my brain as I sat up on the floor. A long string of saliva spun like a web from my lip to the ground. Looking around the room I began to recall everything that happened last night. The thought of it being a bad dream was ruled out when I saw my knife sticking out of the wall, and empty bottles of saline on the floor. I grabbed one of the energy shots from the wicker basket and downed the bottle, hoping the burst of energy would give me the motivation I need for today. Checking my phone the time read that it was currently 2:00 pm. Pulling myself to my feet was a challenge. My legs felt heavy and made of soft rubber. A low rumble spun inside of my stomach, and a familiar salty taste mixed in a thin solution began to pool into my mouth. My shoulder guided me along the wall as I quickly made my way to the bathroom. The ceramic bowl provided me comfort while I blew chunks into it. The taste of acid mixed with the smell of copper filled the bowl. When my eyes opened I noticed that the toilet was filled with blood and bright pink chunks. Daggers began to stab through my abdomen. It felt as if something was carving me out like a pumpkin inside. I placed my hand on my stomach, and to my horror, I thought I felt a bulge roll around inside of me.

	I pulled myself to my feet and stumbled over to the sink. I turned on the faucet and splashed water onto my face. I don't know what's going on with me. Thin ribbons of blood ran through the water and down the drain. Standing upright, I looked into the mirror at myself. Dark purple rings sagged underneath my eyes. ‚ÄúYou look like shit‚Äù I muttered to myself as my fingers investigated the new features on my face. Cupping a palm of water, I fill my mouth to wash out the acidic aftermath inside. When I spit out the bloody battery acid, something solid tinkled into the sink. My fingers shook when I picked up the solid object that fumbled from my gums. Looking into the mirror for confirmation, I saw that my front left tooth was gone. Scared by this discovery, I gently pressed into my other front teeth. They were all loose. Every single one I touched flexed forward and backward with ease. I stopped myself from touching them any further, I didn‚Äôt want to lose anymore if I could help it. I grabbed the fallen tooth I had set aside and put it into my pocket.

	 My hand dropped the tooth, and simultaneously felt something else in there. The soft flat material I pulled out was the card that the landlord had given me, with his number scrawled on with blue ink. Remembering who had gotten me into this mess, I furiously pulled out my phone. When my hand reached into my pocket, I recoiled from a sharp pain resonating from the tip of my finger. Searching for the source of pain, I saw that blood was smeared across my phone. I tracked down the source, which was the tip of my right index finger. The fingernail was still hanging off of it with a thin strand of skin. Softly gritting my loose teeth, I pulled the fingernail the rest of the way off, and threw it into the sink. I wrapped my finger with some toilet paper, and pulled my attention back to the phone number on the card, dialing it into my phone. The phone rang twice before I heard a familiar voice on the other side. ‚ÄúYellow!‚Äù A joyful voice said. ‚ÄúMr. Banks?‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeaking.‚Äù He said with a half attentive voice, as if he was distracted from something. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your new tenant Matt, listen man we gotta talk. I don‚Äôt know if you knew what was wrong with this town, or the crazy fucking alarms, or the thing i seen in my living room last night, but i want my fucking money back. I don‚Äôt know what's happening to me. I‚Äôm falling apart. I need to get my fucking money back, and get the fuck out of this town. ‚Ä¶ He-hello?‚Äù Silent static crackled through the small speaker pressed into my ear. ‚ÄúSay something you son of a bitch!‚Äù After a few more moments of silence, his voice finally came through. ‚ÄúJust give in buddy. It‚Äôs too late for you now. It‚Äôs better this way. Soon everything solid you have will be gone, and you will join it. Just let go.‚Äù Before I could say anything else the call had ended. Frustration took over me, and I slammed my phone against the wall. During the throw I felt a pop in my shoulder and elbow at the same time. It felt as if my arm instantaneously shredded to pieces, and something had dislodged in my joints. I pulled up my sleeve to see my elbow was severely dislocated. Purple swelling began to inflate the area above my dangling forearm. I go into the living room and rummage through one of my boxes for a towel. After finding one I throw it over my shoulder and string up my arm into a makeshift sling.

	Taking a moment for myself, I use it to collect my thoughts. Obviously, something is going on. Something more than just blinking last night. And now my body is apparently falling apart. So despite how angry, and stressed, and scared I am right now, I need to make each move a calculated one. Someone needs to answer for this shit, and I know exactly who to go to.

	Walking out onto the porch, the rays of UV from outside make my eyes feel like they are being squeezed. Taking a look around the street, I saw kids building a snow man in someone‚Äôs front yard. A plow drove up the road, throwing a tsunami of snow to the side. Looking toward my feet, I saw patches of slick ice formed at the bottom of the stoop. I held onto the railing and carefully navigated down the steps, around the hazards. One little slip surely would ruin me for good. Making my way horizontally in my yard, I found myself walking up the steps, and to the door of Beverly‚Äôs home. Using my non-dominate hand, I tapped on the door with an uncoordinated pattern.

The cold blistered into my skin, as a gust of wind filled with soft white crystals flew past me. After a few more moments, I heard the deadbolt on her flick toward the unlock position, and the door swung open gently. ‚ÄúYou fucked up kid.‚Äù The bitter faced old lady scowled at me. ‚ÄúBeverly please, I need your help. I don't know what's going on, or what to do. I'm freaking out, the landlord lied to me, I -‚Äú I was cut off from a wrinkled finger being raised in front of my face. ‚ÄúCome inside, I‚Äôll make some coffee.‚Äù Beverly gestured an arm toward the inside of her home. Hesitant at first, I leaned my center of gravity forward into her living room. I really have no other choice.

	Beverly came from around the corner, presumably her kitchen, wielding two hot cups of fresh coffee. I attempted to lift the hot mug to take a sip, but it was too heavy. Instead I left it on the table to eventually get cold. ‚ÄúI know you probably have questions, so I‚Äôll answer the ones I know you‚Äôre going to ask first.‚Äù Beverly said, sitting down in the chair across from me. ‚ÄúNo, there is no way to stop whatever is happening to you. No, there is no amount of distance you can go to get away from it. And Yes‚Ä¶‚Äù she took a long sip from her coffee, dropped it back down in front of her, and looked up at me from her mug right in the eyes. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ what you saw last night was most definitely real.‚Äù

	‚ÄúWhy the fuck does anyone choose to live in this town?‚Äù Beverly sat back in her chair looking down at her hands seemingly guilty, then raised them clasped together and leaned forward. ‚ÄúWell like I said, I was born in this town. Growing up, the rules were naturally something that we learned first. Above everything else, even before we knew our names. The babies in the town every night at 3:00 would have their eye lids clamped open. Most people would do the same, until an elected mayor was forced to ban the devices by angry parents claiming, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too barbaric‚Äù and ‚Äúi would rather hold them open myself.‚Äù And I guess for the most part it was fine and worked, but there were definitely young that met terrible fates. Families at that point would either start over, leave town, or give in and disappear. The town would cover everything up and move on. But those that stayed in the town, were guaranteed a healthy and prosperous life, as long as they didn‚Äôt blink. Many people in this town own a business of some kind, or win the lottery, or move here to fight the terminal cancer they had been diagnosed with, and miraculously would win the battle with death. But they soon found that the success they had finally claimed, would be torn from them as soon as they would leave town. It only stays if you stay, so people always choose the latter.‚Äù That guilty look she had before seemed to weigh her down once again. She pursed her lips and continued.

	‚ÄúI eventually moved away when I got older. I met the love of my life. We got married, and wanted to have 8 children‚Äù she smiled and clasped her hands together, reminiscing her golden days. Her hands fell slowly though, as a darker memory looked like it started to rain on her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the doctors had told me that we couldn‚Äôt have kids.‚Äù My eyes met Beverly‚Äôs once again, this time with a look of knowing. ‚ÄúI had talked to my husband, and we decided to move back to my home. I warned him about the rules of the town extensively. Repeating over and over again that this was something that he needed to take seriously. After about 3 months of being back, I held a pregnancy test in my hand that was positive. We were so full of joy. We made it all the way through the pregnancy, and around 4 months after that. That‚Äôs when it happened.‚Äù Her shaking hands gripped around her mug until they stopped shaking. 

	‚ÄúWe were standing around my daughter‚Äôs bassinet, getting her ready for another night. Dan had checked all the windows, but forgot to lock the front door after returning home from work. 3:00 on the dot a man broke into our home. Dan grabbed the revolver from the nightstand, but the man had already closed the distance, and jabbed Dan in the back with a knife. He was already gone to the monster before he even hit the ground. Disappearing from sight right in front of the burglar threw him off. He tried to run for the door, but blinked on the way there. Whatever he saw sent him into a state of panic. He only lasted about 15 seconds after he initially blinked. I looked at the bassinet for my daughter. In the struggle of events that unfolded in my house, I had forgotten about my beautiful daughter‚Äù Beverly choked on her words a bit. Clearing her throat she continued. ‚ÄúShe was gone. I like to imagine that it wasn‚Äôt painful for her at all. She didn‚Äôt even have a chance to scream. She was just simply gone. That was the single hardest night I‚Äôve had to survive.‚Äù 

	After she finished talking, the buzzing from the light above us filled in for the silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Beverly, I can‚Äôt begin to know what you went through. Why did you stay after?‚Äù I asked. Beverly wiped away the moisture building in her eyes and cleared her throat. ‚ÄúAfter that night, I vowed to help anyone who finds their way into this town. Lots of houses became vacant, and soon found their way onto the market. Eventually investors from out of town started buying up the lots and renting them out for an ‚Äòaffordable price.‚Äô ‚Äú My face pulled into a scowl when an image of Mr. Banks flashed into my mind. ‚ÄúNow as for you, I‚Äôm afraid there really isn‚Äôt anything that we can do for you at this point. Nobody I have ever known who has blinked, survived longer than a few days. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Beverly said, looking toward the ground. ‚ÄúYour best bet is to go home, relax as much as you can, and take a nice long sleep.‚Äù 

	Walking back through my front door, the only thing I felt was defeated. As far as help went I didn‚Äôt have any. As far as hope went, that was lacking too. I felt a glob of wetness roll down my face. My back leaned into the wall, and I slowly slid down the cold surface. I don't want to die. So much in my life hadn‚Äôt been accomplished yet. I wanted kids. I wanted a beautiful wife to grow old with me. I wanted to feel important to someone. That being torn from me was almost enough to kill me right there on its own. A cough worked its way up my throat and into my hand. Velvet speckles laid a polkadot pattern into my palm. Another cough festered its way into my throat again, and again, into a full blown coughing fit. The rolling feeling in my stomach returned. Auditory cracks and pops came from my abdomen, followed by the feeling of thousands of splinters from inside. A sharp stabbing pain came from the lower middle of my stomach. My hand fell down to the source of the pain, to feel something protruding from the inside of my shirt. I lift my shirt carefully half way up my stomach, horrified to see what lies beneath. A sharp white pointed object was making its way out of my belly button. The pain was beyond bearable.

	Carefully I began to lightly pull on the smooth surface of the object. It was loose. Readjusting my grip, I squeezed a bit tighter and pulled it all the way out. In my hand I held a long chalk white rib bone. When that one was fully out, another one took its place. The next one out with ease, as the gaping hole from the previous rib helped. In total I continued to pull out 6 ribs in total. I put them beside me on the floor. The scene looked like sadistic scraps from a twisted dinner. My stomach turned with the sick image in my mind, I think literally.

	The sun was at the beginning stages of its descent in the sky. Soon the moon would watch over this town, and everyone in it. Unlike them, this would more than likely be my final night. The closer I got to the apparent inevitable fate, the more I tried to come to terms with what I needed to face. I don‚Äôt know if heaven or hell is real, or if there is a god that is real, but it wasn‚Äôt the faith I was taught. I think out of everything, that growing thought is what scared me the most. Was I a good enough person to make it to the heavenly gates? Did the strict rules about sin in the Bible, damn me to hellfire even if I broke one and didn‚Äôt even know it? I lowered my head into my hand and spoke a prayer to myself, hoping that anything would help me at this point.",1,1761163294.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

* brush twice daily (with electric on soft setting PM, with soft manual toothbrush AM) with fluoridated toothpaste
* string floss daily - apparently a little too aggressively, got a lesson today on gentler flossing technique, but at any rate i am thorough
* water floss daily
* cleaning 2x yearly
* mouthguard at night

But at my cleaning today, the dentist noted that I have gum inflammation/swelling, likely mild gingivitis around my top molars.

At my annual cleanings they always comment on how little plaque is on my teeth and mostly spend the time dealing with staining (I drink tea once a day, though usually not wine or coffee) - went like today as well.

I'm not sure how to reduce any gum inflammation or gingivitis from here. The dentist asked if I sleep with my mouth open, which I tend to, so I am considering mouth taping or similar. Would love feedback on this or any other ideas - maybe oral probiotics? I could also add mouth wash and/or tongue scraping to my routine

General health stuff: 40, f, nonsmoker/nondrinker, insulin resistant but controlled with diet/exercise/metformin (A1C is looking good at 5.2 rn). I had some cavities as a kid/teen related to parental neglect but have not had one since I was probably 17 and then cracked a couple molars in my twenties from grinding and have two crowns bc of that. I've been wearing a nightguard for the past 15 years since I got the crowns and getting a small amount of botox to reduce grinding for the past 3-4 years.

1odiogu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odiogu,The RV my metalhead Evalynn lives in. Just finished this pair.,"Last pic is her in her festival gear.

Evalynn is a character of mine who was a high-school drop-out, working a dead-end grocery job, and living check to check in a crappy apartment. She had no prospects and was just existing day to day when she won the lottery at 19. She used the money to hire an accountant (to invest and the like), give her family and friends small gifts, and buy an old RV. She packed her life into it, sold off what didn‚Äôt fit, and picked up her roots.

She had been riding the roads for the last 10 years. Following whatever catches her fancy and whims. Usually bands, music festivals, amusement parks, small county fairs, roadside attractions, and national parks. She has no urgency and pulled over for whatever looks interesting. Her travels have taken her all over North America, including Mexico (which is why she learned Spanish). Sometimes she will make friends and pick up hitchhikers who will join her in her adventures, and they will travel until the desire comes for one or another to split. Longest of these friends stayed with her for a few months. She also has a ham radio she uses to chat with other road nomads like truckers or other RV owners. This is especially nice in the wee hours. She has never needed more than a few hours of sleep (there are some people out there like this).

Whenever she tires of traveling, she will put down roots where she lands. She will get a job wherever will have her, (usually antique shops, book shops, boutiques, bars, coffee shops, and as a janitor at places she thinks are cool like hospitals or tall office buildings). She will integrate into the community, make friends, and leave the RV parked in a local trailer park. She will stick around until the wander-lust takes her again and she will pick up and leave once more. 

None would guess her wealth for she is frugal and does not flaunt. The only tip-offs is when one thinks about ticket prices for the place she has been to. All the money has done for her has enabled her to have the life she always wanted to live. No worries aside from getting home to family for Christmas. Never has to do anything she doesn‚Äôt want to do. Friends all over North America, and more memories than could fill 10 average lifetimes, and she has so much ahead. 60 years hopefully. She only plans on stopping when she can go no longer. She will just someday when she is old and grey land in another trailer park and turn her RV off and never start it back up again.",2,1761162913.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

I got COVID in November of 2020 and it completely destroyed me; everything I knew about who I was, just gone in a matter of months.

To say I was an active person before COVID would have been an understatement. My gym peers called me ""Cyborg""; I could jump any box, lift any weight, and outrun anyone. Picture a smaller version of someone at the CrossFit games. I felt invincible. I'm a proud 6th generation Marine Corps veteran and I've always been a 'driven sheepdog'; it's what I was born for.

In the year 2020, I was 41 years old. Before I got COVID, there were only a few weird things happening with my health, which now make perfect sense. I had been on 5 tabs of lorazepam per month to use just before my period, since that's when my anxiety would ramp up. I noticed that I'd been getting more anxious throughout the month, which was concerning. My cholesterol was increasing, which made no sense since my food intake and activity hadn't changed a bit. I had been a highly disciplined, macro-counter for years. I was getting funky injuries involving my achilles, hamstring, sacrum; nothing of concern on MRI's. Got PT and kept moving forward.

Then in November 2020, I got COVID. My sister says, ""COVID was the brick wall that you ran head-first into going 100 mph."" It stopped me completely. My experience with COVID was unbearable pain; it seemed to target my already injured areas and just sit there; back, sciatica, sacrum. I couldn't sit, stand, or walk for long periods of time. I got PTSD-level anxiety beyond anything I'd ever experienced as a Marine Corps veteran. I became a recluse. Too fearful to leave my home. In too much pain to do any of the things I liked to do; go on walks, read a book, watch a movie. Doctors wouldn't listen to me because ""COVID doesn't do those things""; of course, now they know differently, but at the time, they didn't believe me. It was scary and isolating. The people that were supposed to help, wouldn't help. I also lost taste and smell; except for coffee...coffee smelled like poop. It's the only thing I could smell and there ain't NO WAY I was drinking poop-smelling coffee. So I became a tea drinker.

For the first month, it wasn't too bad; I just felt like I had the flu. It wasn't until week 4 when things really started to ramp up...and that just so happened to coincide with my menstrual cycle. From late December 2020 through late April 2021, I'd start to feel a bit better until I got my period and then all the symptoms came back with a vengeance, PLUS the worst periods I'd ever had in my life. By February, I was noticing the pattern and begging God for healing before Day 1 came again. Around May, that seemed to calm down. What I was left with was the pain and anxiety, absence of taste and smell, and some fatigue. I got my energy back after a few months, my taste and smell back after 1 year, but I've been battling the pain and anxiety for 5 years now.

I've tried EVERYTHING; you name it, I've done it. Every specialist full of confidence that they KNOW what's wrong with me and that they can fix it; but then within a few months, their confidence wanes and their verbiage towards me starts to indicate that it's either in my head or I must be doing something wrong. During this time, I ate clean, I tried keto, carnivore, no gluten, no dairy, etc; I ate high protein and walked as much as I could. I lifted what I could. I didn't give up.

I decided to go to a naturopath. They tested my hormones and said that all three of them were in the ditch; which she thought was weird since I was in my early 40's still. Started on hormone supplements and seemed to improve a bit, and my naturopath was pleased with my hormone progression. I got less pain and anxiety.

Fast forward to August 2024; I was at a conference out of town and someone at the conference brought COVID with them, and I got it. I was terrified that it would set me back to 2020, but surprisingly, it just felt like the flu. What it DID do, is give me back-to-back periods for months; me, who'd had 28-day clockwork periods since age 11. My ovaries felt like they were on FIRE. I was getting heart palpitations, racing heart, etc. Went to the naturopath; my hormones were in the ditch again, and so we doubled down on the supplements; but this time, they didn't work. My hormones stayed in the ditch. My naturopath was perplexed.

2025 rolled around. Social media is BLOWING UP about how the 2002 Women's Health Initiative was debunked, how perimenopause can happen 10 YEARS before actual menopause, AND (this was the most important thing), how COVID can affect the reproductive system of a woman.

The pieces started falling into place...did I actually have long COVID? Or did COVID catapult me into full blown peri since I was already probably in it? (i.e. anxiety, cholesterol, musculoskeletal joint pain)...ü§îü§îü§î COVID so obviously was linked to my hormones, soooooo...might HRT be the answer?

Started progesterone 4 months ago and anxiety went down and sleep returned; started estradiol patches 3 months ago and joint pain went significantly down; started testosterone 2 months ago, and my mojo is steadily coming back (Cyborg 2.0 Reboot - older and wiser üòâ). Periods are quieting down. No more 'flood-gate crime-scenes' to welcome me on Days 2 and 3, no more PMS; it quietly comes and it quietly goes and that is all. I've been waiting to see how much improvement I got before I posted here.

I'm including a few links that might be helpful. I hope my story helps someone.

My question is, if I don't open the vacuum sealed bag, how long can a lighter roast (but not full light nordic) tend to last unopened? Could I keep a bag for 6-8 weeks after roast date before opening with quality loss?

This does not need to be limited to espresso. I ask because Prodigal recommends 3-4 weeks, but then Scott Rao & Gagne seem to discuss how even longer post roast with lighter roasted beans is still fine...?

Here‚Äôs how it went with my dream.

In a dream, at home, I sound like a child version? My parent mentions where are going somewhere and promise we will go there, but every time we are about to, it gets delayed with something. It kept repeating. Then when I woke up, then back to sleep, then after the 4th time falling back to sleep, it kept repeating. I would be having a temper tantrum, trying to break something, maybe growl?, yelling in a higher pitched like the sound of that child voice.

That‚Äôs when it was angering me to punch something, but I decided to get up at 4am, get coffee and all. It‚Äôs so weird to, considering I‚Äôm a 27-year-old, nothing much going on in my life.

So, this theme, the previous ones, where dreams of a child version of myself, learning we are in a different country, I ask my parents when are we going home? Why we have to wait an extra week. That week turns to another, then a month. So the same tantrums and panic happens, trying to figure out ways to get back, rob credit cards, my mind suggested me, we attack people in the dream?

We met on Grindr, at first it was mostly chillouts, usual amount of non-penetrative sex early on (probably every time we met the first couple of weeks). Then it shifted into actual dates ‚Äî coffee, walks, dinners, museums ‚Äî and we really connected. We share the same humor, taste in clothes, and interest in art. He‚Äôs buff (which I love), I‚Äôm super attracted to him, and he seems attracted to me too. I'm a top, he's a bottom, I really wanna bang him more and he likes me topping him, which I‚Äôve done twice.

But lately, sex has slowed way down. For the past month and a half, he‚Äôs often said ‚Äúno sex tonight‚Äù even before things get heated. Sometimes he still wants to give me a blowjob ‚Äì he prefers giving without getting anything back he says¬†too ‚Äì but overall, it feels like his sex drive is low. He‚Äôs affectionate, loves cuddling, teasing, kissing, and seems into me emotionally, but there‚Äôs still this weird disconnect because he also like winces and gets distracted by something or plays off kisses and making out and makes jokes or something right in the beginning. So we never really have much passionate kissing our touching which also bothers me a lot.

I‚Äôve told him sex is really important to me (I have a high sex drive, not crazy much more than average but I hook up a few times a week on the apps when I'm single). He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot much of a sex person,‚Äù ranking sex below food in terms of life quality ‚Äì where I sort of answered that it's on the top of my list (considering food's more of a necessity rather than pleasure). I‚Äôve realized that his lack of sex drive with me is a dealbreaker, especially this early on, and I can‚Äôt see myself in a long-term relationship where our drives are so mismatched.

Here‚Äôs where it gets complicated though: a month ago, he recommended his personal trainer to me. I told him clearly beforehand that I‚Äôd only do the 3 free trial sessions and that I couldn‚Äôt afford to continue beyond that ‚Äî which he totally respected at the time. But after seeing how much I liked the training, he surprised me by saying he‚Äôd pay for half of a full package (about $300) as a birthday gift. I told him I couldn‚Äôt afford it otherwise (my health insurance only covers the other half of it and then it's used up), and he insisted, saying it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. It was a really kind gesture, and I was touched.
Then, for my actual birthday, he surprised me again with a $500 Lady Gaga concert ticket. I‚Äôd mentioned weeks before that I wanted to go but tickets are hard to find and I couldn‚Äôt afford the resale ones for more than $400. I was shocked, and he said he just wanted to make me happy and that money wasn‚Äôt a problem for him. It‚Äôs sweet, but also a bit overwhelming, especially since it‚Äôs only been 2.5 months.

Now I‚Äôm looking for advice. I really like him, but I‚Äôm sexually frustrated and don‚Äôt see this working long-term. I also feel awful about the idea of breaking things off after he‚Äôs given me such generous gifts. I‚Äôve thought about paying him back over time, suggesting a repayment plan or something in the event that I dump him because I‚Äôd feel terrible taking the PT sessions and the concert and then just ditching him.

I started fasting a decade ago. In college, I suffered from horrible self esteem and developed an eating disorder with a binge and purge cycle. It was really unpleasant and did bad things to my body. After almost 2 years, I decided I was done and wanted to recover. To stop purging was easy enough, you just dont do it. It painful and stopping was easy. The binging part was harder, i did it compulsively and couldn't stop. I was in the recovery process by myself and unaided, so I turned to fasting. I would do a 36-40hr fast once or twice a week for a few months. The benefits were noticeable: 1. I was able to steadily lose the weight i had put on from the ED, and 2. It seemed to help regulate my hungry and fullness hormones. It helped me understand what it felt like to be ACTUALLY hungry, not just fueled by anxiety and compulsion, and then how to push through it. Fasting was incredibly healing for me at the time, and I was able to go back to eating normal portions of food intuitively and maintain a weight I was happy with for many years through proper nutrition, appropriate portion sizes, and regular exercise. 

Now, ten years later, im 33 F 5'5 and 147lb. I work out about 4x a week and I've put on some good muscle mass, which I can see flexing in the mirror, but is otherwise covered by a layer of fat everywhere. Im not overweight yet by standard medical criteria, but I can tell im holding onto at least an extra 10-15lbs that I dont need. You cant really see any definition of the hard work I've put in if im not flexing (I mean, you can see it in my shoulders and butt, but not in the arms and legs where I hold most of my fat. My jeans are all tight around the thighs and my arms look fat in a tank top).

I also have been interested in autophagy. Ive been reading about its benefits online. My family is prone to a certain type of cancer and, although I go for my tests and screenings regularly, im willing to go the extra mile to avoid going through what I've seen some family members go through. I hear autophagy can attack or suppress cancer cells ü§û

So im back to fasting! Im no stranger to intermittent fasting and have been doing it on and off for several years. I typically will do a dirty 18:6 (splash of milk in my coffee) for 4-6 days of the week. I am also doing rolling 40s (am I using that phrase correctly? üòÖ) as in, one 40hr fast a week on a day I dont intend to work out. The first one was uncomfortable, but the second one seems a bit easier. I am sure its something you get more used to, as with anything.

I do have a couple questions though:
- Do you think these 40hrs once a week is enough to trigger autophagy?
- Do you like partaking in cannabis while fasting? I personally do, as it helps suppress my appetite, but I know it has the opposite effect on people
- Whats something you like to do to keep busy? Ive been crafting A LOT but I cant bake obviously, too temping and too many good smells.

All of your posts and progress pictures have motivated me so much. Sometimes when I feel a craving, I read through your posts and it gets me through. Thank you ü´∂",3,1761162347.0,fasting,1,0.8,False

Saw this place yesterday and walked into their soft opening. Technique is spot-on, incredible lamination in the layers, you can tell they took the time to carefully temp the dough and butter because there was no lingering grease if you rub between your fingers. Each layer was shatteringly crisp to bite into, and flakes perfectly. The flavour is AMAZING, this is as good as any bakery in Quebec/Europe, and they use CULTURED BUTTER (!!!!!) You can actually taste the fermented butter tang that isn't just masked with sugar or salt. 

I bought two other pastries to go: a chocolate-banana danish and a cinnamon brioche to see how well they kept. The lady was lovely and helpful and gave reheating instructions which I appreciated. 

Left it on the counter with a paper towel underneath --- took the chocolate banana danish at the 8hr mark, reheated it according to instructions. There's a bit of grease leaking through the layers, but it was still very crisp, and the filling didn't leak through so it didn't have soggy bottom issues. Nice touch of acid (lemon juice?) between the banana and chocolate pearls, which kept it from becoming too heavy and rich.

Had the cinnamon danish the next day, I think the lemon glaze helped keep it, although the pastry was getting harder (more stale). Still very acceptable and probably fridging will preserve it longer. Can't really go wrong with cinnamon and sugar, so excellent flavour that pairs well with coffee. 

Right now, I think this place is the BEST pain au chocolat in Toronto. If you're homesick for a flavour (Dominque Ansel Tokyo rip my beloved), this is the closest you can get to a pure Euro-style cultured butter croissant. 

The only downside is their seating and variety is pretty limited. I'll still go to Bisou for my escargot/pain au raisin fix, but if I want a pure croissant, this place hits the spot. ",4,1761162289.0,FoodToronto,0,1.0,False
1odiebs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1odiebs/aio_emotional_cheating_or_harmless_friendship/,AIO - emotional cheating or harmless friendship?,"Hi Reddit,  
First-time post! I‚Äôve been struggling with this for a while and could use some outside perspective.

My husband has a long-time female friend - someone he‚Äôs known since childhood. Over the past year (maybe longer), I noticed their communication becoming more frequent.

It started when she reached out to him for advice about her troubled marriage. She asked to meet for coffee. He asked if I was okay with it, and I said sure. I trusted him, they‚Äôve known each other for 20+ years, and she said she just wanted advice. I did ask, ‚ÄúDoes she not have other friends she can talk to?‚Äù He said maybe she doesn‚Äôt have any guy friends she can trust.

Over the next few months, though, she started baking him bread, messaging more often, and sending long, personal texts about things she was going through. My gut told me it was crossing into something inappropriate. I mentioned my discomfort a few times, and he said he‚Äôd stop meeting with her or accepting anything from her.

When I finally looked through their messages, it was obvious her tone was flirty and emotional ‚Äî not fully crossing the line, but close. She‚Äôd send him silly videos of ‚Äúkids being mean to their crushes‚Äù and say things like *‚ÄúRemember back in the day when you used to like me?‚Äù*

A few examples of her messages:

* ‚ÄúI just wanted to tell you thank you so much for being there for me. You have no idea what that means to me.‚Äù 
* ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt meet up this day, no worries. We always find our way to each other.‚Äù 
* ‚ÄúYou liked my video twice. You‚Äôre obsessed‚Ä¶‚Äù

From what I saw, my husband never replied flirtatiously. He just ‚Äúhearted‚Äù most of her messages, even the flirty ones.

What hurts most is that now this woman has something to hold over me. She can say, *‚ÄúYour husband let me get close to him.‚Äù*

When I confronted him, he immediately apologized and said I was right. I asked him to look at the messages and tell me honestly if they weren‚Äôt inappropriate. He admitted they were and said if the roles were reversed, he would feel the same way.

But then, when he messaged her to end the friendship, his wording was, *‚ÄúMy wife went through our messages and didn‚Äôt like it,‚Äù* instead of acknowledging that what they were doing was wrong. It made it sound like I was the problem, not their behavior.

I feel sick. I don‚Äôt do things to him that I wouldn‚Äôt want done to me. Nothing physical happened, but it still feels like a line was crossed and trust was broken. I do appreciate that every time I said something, he ended it in a way, but he's not completely innocent either because he let it continue although he was aware it was starting to get flirtatious.   
  
My issue is, if I did not look through the messages, how long would this go on for? He only stopped it because I found out. What would happen

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they‚Äôd live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I‚Äôll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (Ôºæ-Ôºæ)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I‚Äôd appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I‚Äôd love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we‚Äôd write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don‚Äôt want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don‚Äôt be deterred by that even if you‚Äôre from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don‚Äôt have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that‚Äôs worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you‚Äôll understand <3

- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I‚Äôve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let‚Äôs brainstorm them together!*

1odib5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1odib5n/the_whistling_man/,The Whistling Man,"I remember the heat first.

The kind of suffocating, thick heat that clings to your skin even before the sun rises it was that slow, sticky breath of summer that makes the air heavy enough to drink. I must‚Äôve been around ten or eleven when it happened. I woke before dawn that morning, covered in sweat. The sheet felt damp, my hair plastered to my face, and even the walls of our small house seemed to breathe with me, it was hot, restless, alive.

My father‚Äôs voice came from the kitchen.

‚Äú¬°Lev√°ntate! It‚Äôs almost time to go!‚Äù

He was a man of habits, the type who believed breakfast wasn‚Äôt a meal unless it left you too full to move. Eggs, beans, tortillas, and coffee so strong it could peel paint. And no matter how hot the day was going to be, he‚Äôd still sit down and eat it like a soldier preparing for battle.

So I ate too, because saying no wasn‚Äôt an option. My stomach churned with the food and the heat. Even before I stepped outside, sweat was dripping down my neck.

It was still dark when we left. The sky had only begun to lighten, a dull purple glow far to the east. The cicadas were already screaming from the trees, and the road shimmered with a faint film of humidity.

Our school sat nearly forty-five minutes away, and we walked every day, through cracked, uneven streets that faded into dirt paths the closer you got to the river. The first stretch had a few lampposts, flickering orange like dying candles. Past that, the light disappeared completely. You‚Äôd hear the river before you saw it, a low, endless murmur that mixed with the buzz of insects and the occasional bark of a distant dog.

That morning, my father talked as we walked. He always did. He liked to tell stories, random things he‚Äôd heard from old friends, travelers, drunks at the cantina. Some were funny, others strange. But that morning, for whatever reason, his tone changed.

‚ÄúYou walk too slow, mija,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt move faster, the Whistling Man will catch you.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Whistling Man. Haven‚Äôt I told you about him?‚Äù

I shook my head.

He chuckled under his breath, a dry, knowing laugh that always meant listen carefully.

‚ÄúThey say around here, if you‚Äôre walking alone late at night, you might hear someone behind you. At first, it‚Äôs just footsteps. Then, whistling. Slow, like he‚Äôs matching your pace. If you stop, he starts walking faster. If you run, he runs. But if you keep walking steady, 'never turning around, never stopping', he‚Äôll leave you alone.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúDad, that‚Äôs just a story.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut everyone around the river knows, so never walk home too slow. Especially when the air feels like it‚Äôs holding its breath.‚Äù

He looked down the road as he said it, toward the dark stretch that disappeared into the trees. There was a moment,  barely a second ‚Äî where he looked uneasy. Then he smiled again and changed the subject.

I thought about that story all day at school. It stuck to me like the humidity, this half-whispered warning that didn‚Äôt make sense. By the time we walked home that afternoon, I‚Äôd already forgotten it.

But a few years later, I remembered.

I was sixteen.

And I learned that some stories don‚Äôt stay stories forever.

It was a Saturday night, and there‚Äôd been a small neighborhood party near the plaza, there was music, laughter, people drinking and dancing until late. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be out that long, but time slipped by. By the time I left, the moon was high and the air thick again, that same heavy, humming heat from my childhood.

There were two ways home. One went past the soccer field, the longer, a few more streetlights, safer. The other cut closer to the river, which was darker, shorter, quieter. I‚Äôd taken that path countless times during the day, but rarely at night.

I told myself I wasn‚Äôt scared. I was just tired and didn‚Äôt want to get yelled at for coming home late. So I took the river road.

The sound hit me first ‚Äî the slow current licking at the rocks, the rustle of the tall grass, the small plop of fish jumping for insects. The moonlight spilled across the water like melted silver. It was almost pretty, in a lonely kind of way.

We didn‚Äôt have phones back then, not in our town, so there was no flashlight to keep me company, just my own footsteps on the dirt road and the rhythmic song of crickets.

I walked fast at first, but soon slowed down. The night had a strange stillness to it. Even the air seemed to have a weight, pressing against my chest.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

Footsteps.

Soft. A few paces behind.

I froze for half a second, not from fear, but from habit. Out there, in that dark stretch of road, people did sometimes walk late. Maybe another girl, or a neighbor heading home. Still, instinct told me to be cautious.

I decided to slow down a little, thinking I‚Äôd let the person pass so I could follow behind instead.

But the moment I slowed down, I heard something else,  faint, but clear.

Whistling.

A simple tune, if you could call it that. Just three notes, over and over.
Low, long, breathy.

My skin prickled. The sound wasn‚Äôt behind me anymore ‚Äî it was beside me.

I turned my head slightly, but there was nothing there. The road stretched out empty, silver in the moonlight.

I told myself it was the wind. Except‚Ä¶ the air was still. Completely still.

Then the footsteps started again. Louder this time.

Crunch.
Crunch.
Crunch.

I tried to ignore them, but the rhythm matched mine perfectly. When I sped up, so did they. When I slowed down, they did too.

And then came the whistle again, way closer, clearer, right at my ear.

A long, trembling note that seemed to snake its way inside my skull.

I don‚Äôt remember deciding to run. My body just did it. My feet hit the dirt so hard I thought my sandals would break. I ran until my chest burned, until the road curved toward the small corner where a single streetlight buzzed.

When I reached the light, I stopped and turned around for the first time.

No one.

The road behind me was empty. The moon reflected off the water, and the trees swayed gently. My heart hammered so hard I felt sick. I tried to laugh it off ‚Äî told myself it had to be an echo, maybe my own footsteps bouncing off the river wall.

That‚Äôs when I heard it,  a sigh.

Not mine.

It came from right behind my ear, soft and human and impossibly close.

And I felt it, the warm exhale brushing the back of my neck.

I ran again, screaming this time. The footsteps followed, faster, heavier, pounding the earth right behind me. I didn‚Äôt look back. I couldn‚Äôt.

Our house sat near the end of the road, just before the bridge. I could see the faint light spilling through the cracks of the front door. I yelled for my father, my voice raw and breaking.

When the door opened, I stumbled inside, gasping. My father grabbed my arms, asking what happened, but I couldn‚Äôt answer. All I could do was point toward the road.

He stepped outside, frowning, scanning the darkness.

And that‚Äôs when I saw him.

At the edge of the streetlight, where the glow faded into the dark ‚Äî stood a tall figure. A man.

He wore a hat, tilted just enough to hide his face, and clothes that looked too neat, too clean for our dusty town. He didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt speak.

But even from where I stood, I could see it.
The faint curl of his mouth.
A smile.

My father didn‚Äôt see him. When I blinked, he was gone.

That night, I barely slept. Every sound, the creak of the house, the chirp of a cricket, made my pulse jump. At one point, just before dawn, I thought I heard it again.

A faint whistle, drifting through the open window.

Three notes.
Low.
Long.
Slow.

I pressed my hands over my ears and prayed until the sun came up.

Years passed. I moved away, to the city, where the nights were loud and full of light. The river road became something I only saw in dreams or in the rare times I visited my parents.

But the memory never left me.

Sometimes, when I walk home late from work, I swear I catch the faintest echo of that whistle somewhere behind me. Always distant, always just out of reach.

Once, I even turned around. There was no one there, only the hum of traffic and a stray breeze that brushed the back of my neck, soft as breath.

I told myself I imagined it.
I want to believe that.

But a few years ago, when my grandfather passed away, I found myself back home for the funeral. I hadn‚Äôt been near the river in over a decade. The town was quieter now, emptier. Most of the streetlights didn‚Äôt work anymore.

That first night after the service, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. So I walked.

I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe grief, maybe nostalgia, maybe something that wanted me to look one last time. The moon was bright, the air thick again with that same familiar weight.

The river hadn‚Äôt changed. The same smell of wet earth and algae, the same slow current whispering against the stones. I stood there for a long time, staring at my reflection in the water.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

Footsteps.

Soft. Rhythmic.

And then...the whistle.

The same three notes, low and patient, like he‚Äôd been waiting all these years for me to come back.

I turned around slowly.

There was no one on the road.

But across the water, on the opposite bank, I saw something move, a tall figure standing under the trees, hat casting a shadow over his face.

He didn‚Äôt come closer. He just stood there. Watching.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My throat locked, my heart pounding so hard it hurt.

The whistle came again, echoing over the river, and though the distance should‚Äôve made it faint, it sounded as if it were right next to my ear.

I ran then, like I had when I was sixteen, tripping over rocks, the sound of my heartbeat mixing with the whistle that followed me all the way to the edge of town.

When I reached my parents‚Äô house, I didn‚Äôt turn around. Not once.

It‚Äôs been years since then. I live far away now, another country, another life. But sometimes, late at night, when the world goes still and the air feels heavy, I swear I hear it again.

That low, dragging whistle slipping through the silence like a warning.

I‚Äôve learned not to stop walking when I hear it.
Not to slow down.
Not to look back.

Because maybe my father was right,  maybe there really is something that walks those dark roads by the river.

And maybe it never stopped following me.

If you ever find yourself walking alone, and you hear someone whistling behind you,  don‚Äôt stop. Don‚Äôt run. Just keep your pace steady and your eyes forward.

Because if you turn around‚Ä¶ you might find out what he‚Äôs smiling at.",1,1761162075.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I have a 1 bedroom flat with a balcony. It's fully equipped (dishwasher, washer, dryer), has fast wifi, a TV, very comfy sofa, Ninja Foodi, Oven, Hob, coffee machine, microwave, toaster and pretty much everything you'd need. The bedroom has a queen size bed (I also have a memory foam mattress topper that you could use if you like) and I also have a folding single mattress that I put out in the living room for guests that would be available for use.

Transport wise - you have the jubilee line (Kilburn and West hampstead) within 15 mins walk, the overground (Kilburn High road) is 5 mins walk, the Bakerloo line (Kilburn Park) is 7 mins walk and the Thameslink (Wesh Hampstead) is about 17 mins walk. There's also several lime bikes and Zipcars around.

I want to go away somewhere from say 23 Dec - 5 Jan (flexible on dates - by a few days to a week on either side not by weeks or shifting it completely).

I'm open for swapping location but Ideally any of the below or similar:

* Scotland somewhere in nature - maybe somewhere where it might snow and you maybe have a hot tub?
* Canary Islands near a beach - would need to be modern with a dishwasher etc
* Bad ass villa in SE Asia with a pool (and maybe near a beach)
* Istanbul apartment (min 3 bedrooms) - would need to be modern with a dishwasher etc
* Flat in Dubai (min 2 bed)

We'll need to online meet via video, exchange photos/videos of each other place, etc etc.",2,1761161850.0,homeswap,0,1.0,False

Needless to say, my attempts to explain what the Gooweny-Ein[ ](https://)is and the very real danger he poses are not going over well with my ex-girlfriend. ‚ÄúYou saw him,‚Äù I reply. ‚ÄúDid he look human to you?‚Äù

Stacey scoffs, but she crosses her arms and clenches her jaw in such a way that I can tell she doesn‚Äôt have a rebuttal. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the Goony-En or whatever you called it.‚Äù She says after a moment. ‚ÄúListen to yourself. Curses! Monsters! This is crazy!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, I know it‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs true. You have to trust me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust you!‚Äù She yells as if this is the most obscene thing I‚Äôve ever said, and I know for a fact it‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs heard me say some pretty stupid things.

‚ÄúIf you see him again, you‚Äôll die‚Ä¶or worse.‚Äù I reiterate, thinking again of the descriptions I‚Äôve read of that woman cutting herself in half with a chainsaw, and how she‚Äôd attacked her parents before killing herself. ¬†

Stacey looks like she‚Äôs going to argue for a moment, but instead she slumps down on my couch and rubs her forehead with both hands. ‚ÄúI need a drink.‚Äù She says wearily.

‚ÄúYou sure that‚Äôs a good idea?‚Äù I ask, thinking of our last fight. I‚Äôm not going to say that alcohol caused our argument, but it was certainly a factor.

She glares at me, and, sighing, I relent. I‚Äôve put all my hard liquor and most of my beer on top of my kitchen cabinets, right up near the ceiling. Keeping it out of reach has prevented me from drowning in it these past few days, but for Stacey, I get my step stool out and pull down a bottle of dark rum. I get us each a glass and some ice, take the cap off the liquor, and watch as the golden liquid flows over cubes as clear as Icelandic spar.

Stacey remains on my couch, wringing her hands and looking around nervously. When I bring over the rum, she snatches it from me with a trembling hand. By the time I put the bottle on the coffee table and sit down beside her, she‚Äôs already polished off her drink and has taken a few additional gulps right from the bottle.

She fills her cup again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd ask how things have been going for you‚Ä¶‚Äù she says with a laugh as filled to the brim with sarcasm as her glass is with rum.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt bother,‚Äù I reply, adding my own bitter laugh to hers.

‚ÄúSo, how long has that thing been after you?‚Äù She asks after a few more swigs. Her words are starting to slur.

‚ÄúFour days,‚Äù I answer, avoiding her gaze. I want to say so much - about our breakup, about how sorry I am that she‚Äôs wrapped up in this curse with me - but I can‚Äôt find the words.

She nods and sucks in the sides of her cheeks a bit as if to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs unfortunate‚Äù without being too sincere about it. Then, she blows air out of her mouth as if she‚Äôs anxiously trying to think of something else to say. I get the sense she resents me; she doesn‚Äôt want to, but she does; though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs over our breakup, the monster stalking us, or both. ‚ÄúIs that how long I‚Äôm going to be stuck here?‚Äù She says after a moment, her voice quiet, ‚ÄúBecause I had plans this weekend, you know? And I have a job. I don‚Äôt even have my laptop.‚Äù She laughs, though I know for damn sure she doesn‚Äôt find this funny, ‚ÄúIf I had known I‚Äôd be trapped in your apartment, I would have packed a bag or something.‚Äù As her tone becomes less sincere, her gestures become more grandiose, and I can tell she‚Äôs drunk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to think of some way out of this,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing everything I can.‚Äù

She nods her head as one side of her mouth dimples with a sort of melancholy. ‚ÄúI know you will.‚Äù She says gently. For a moment, she looks as if she might say something profound or vulnerable, but instead she gets up and announces that she‚Äôs going to bed. I watch her stumble to my room, unsure if she wants me to follow or not. I suppose I'm uncertain if it's right to follow, really. I decide to sit out on my couch, slowly finishing off my glass of rum as I try to think of how to get us both out of the Gooweny-Ein‚Äôs clutches.

After maybe twenty minutes, I go in to check on her, expecting to find her passed out in my bed. Instead, I find her standing straight up, looking in the direction of the blinds. ‚ÄúStacey?‚Äù I say cautiously. Before she can respond, I see that the edge of the blinds is folded, as if someone has moved them. *She‚Äôs* moved them, I realize. In her drunken state, she must have lifted them to look outside when the Gooweny-Ein tapped on the window and called for her. Maybe she briefly forgot about the curse and only caught herself too late, or perhaps curiosity just got the best of her. Whatever happened, it's sealed her fate, and likely mine too.

She turns slowly. Her eyes are wide with fright. Her clothing is cut down the middle, right where the ribs meet the sternum. It's not just her clothing that‚Äôs been sliced, though; there‚Äôs blood all down her shirt, and I can see through layers of skin and muscle deep into her chest cavity. There‚Äôs something else in there, too ‚Äì something moving. It stretches and contorts as if it‚Äôs trying to force itself into a tight pair of jeans ‚Äì only those jeans are her body. Her arms raise, and I hear popping and crunching sounds as her muscles try to resist, but she‚Äôs not in control anymore; the Gooweny-Ein is piloting her from the inside now.

While I am locked up in my office with a nice cup of coffee, work is quite boring currently. So what better chance to post and see what I can find! I am always looking for new people to talk with, everyone is unique and interesting in their own ways. A bit about myself to start things off: 

* Live in Canada (MST timezone) and work as an accountant. I am quite left leaning, and while I can get along with most people, I do not tolerant any hateful or bigoted thinking 
*  For my freetime, you will mostly find me hanging out with online friends, gaming, reading, or watching something like Youtube, Animes, or TV shows. Game wise I have been playing Hades 2, Borderlands 4, Dwarf Fortress, WoW, and Rimworld lately. Honestly just play anything I enjoy and am not locked too much in genres. 
* Have recently gotten back into curling as well. Played it as a teenager but find myself enjoying it much more now. Probably has something to do with not being a moody, impatient teenager anymore. 
* Music is also a big part of my life. Just so much easier to express my thoughts and feelings through songs. I would say Alternative and Indie rock are some of my preferred genres, but if I hear something and like it I will add it to my playlist. I am always down for sharing song recommendations and sharing/making playlists to swap! 
* Recently have been trying to learn how to do some photography to help better capture the views I see. It's... going as best as it can with an older digital camera, but hey, it is getting me or out and about. 
* I do have interest in subjects such as geography, geology, and history. I like just pulling open a map, picking a random spot, and seeing what I can learn about it. I do have interests in other things as well, those are just a few I have always had a stronger focus on. 

With all that said, really I can just message/talk about anything. I am quite an open book, and there are very few topics I am uncomfortable with, and when I am I make it known. I am open to getting to know just about anyone, just as long as you are a decent person.",0,1761161805.0,r4r,1,0.25,False

Universal Horror Unleashed- this is the obvious and shiniest option as it‚Äôs new, but not without merit! I really enjoyed the houses and thought the food was damn good. However, the price was a bit rough compared to some other places. 

Horror Vibes Coffee- This is such a cool spot, and while not a place you can spend a day at, I‚Äôve really enjoyed getting a spooky drink to start my day. The pastries are also decent, but honestly the art/decorations are my favorite. Try to get there early if you really want to go, they fill up FAST. Last Saturday they had a line out the door

FrightDome- if you‚Äôve been to Vegas in the early 2010s or lived here, this is back! I actually know one of the managers and they couldn‚Äôt be more proud of bringing scares back to the AdventureDome, and I had a blast. Bit more pricy than it used to be, but obviously a labor of love. 

Parade of Mischief at DTS- haven‚Äôt had a chance to see it this year, but I know I will and there‚Äôs plenty to do at Downtown Summerlin

Beverly Theaters: The Wake (50-movie horror marathon)- from classics to modern staples, there‚Äôs a bunch of horror gems being shown by them and is a yearly event I look forward to.

Area 15- while not exclusively ‚Äúhorror‚Äù or ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù there‚Äôs plenty of creepy and interesting things to see here lol

31 Screams Haunted House- Tivoli Village is doing a Haunted House Wed-Sun, and while I haven‚Äôt gone, my buddy said it was a good time.

Zak Bagan‚Äôs The Haunted Museum- This is a bit out of the way, but there are some historical displays to see here and is a decent time.

SAW and IT Escape rooms- these are pretty scary compared to your average escape room, but they are fucking cool! If you‚Äôre a fan of either series, I‚Äôd check them out.

Tom Devlin‚Äôs Monster Museum- Super fun place and Devlin is such a cool dude. If you like horror, he‚Äôll chat you up for hours with sick stories and BTS stuff. 

Hope to catch some of yall around in the spirit of Halloween!!!

The armor glints under torchlight, polished to a mirror shine - ‚ÄúAh, my morning jokes,‚Äù John mutters. Patting a breastplate - ‚ÄúSoft, protective, mostly harmless, but they keep me from being mauled by outrage before coffee.‚Äù

He lifts a longsword, the edge catching the light. ‚ÄúAnd this,‚Äù he says, flicking the blade, ‚Äúis my punchline delivery. Sharp, precise, occasionally leaves someone stunned, sometimes bleeding metaphorically, sometimes literally‚Äîbut always memorable.‚Äù

A dagger rests on a nearby rack. John picks it up with a grin. ‚ÄúAh, the subtle digs. Quick, sneaky, unexpected‚Äîlike that sarcastic line that hits the network exec in the gut while everyone else just laughs at the absurdity.‚Äù

He gestures toward the shields, round and sturdy. ‚ÄúThese,‚Äù he says, bumping one with a shoulder, ‚Äúare the context checks. Block the nonsense, absorb the attacks, and give me time to land the real jokes. Without these, even the sharpest punchlines just glance off and hurt the wrong audience.‚Äù

John flicks an arrow from a quiver. ‚ÄúAh, the rhetorical arrows. Fly clean, strike true, and leave the room questioning why the heck they didn‚Äôt see it coming. Sometimes it‚Äôs subtle, sometimes it‚Äôs aimed square at your ego‚Äîbut always with impeccable aim.‚Äù

A catapult dominates the corner, stones piled neatly like props. John leans on it. ‚ÄúAnd this‚Ä¶ this is my explosive commentary. Big, dramatic, impossible to ignore. Occasionally collateral damage, but sometimes you just need to hurl a boulder at the absurdity of the day and watch the walls of stupidity crumble.‚Äù

He steps back, surveying the room. ‚ÄúEvery piece in here,‚Äù John concludes, tapping helmet to chestplate, ‚Äúis a part of the comedy. The armor keeps me safe, the sword lands the joke, the dagger sneaks in the quip, the shield buffers nonsense, the arrows hit the vulnerable spots, and the catapult?

The afternoon smelled of pot roast and betrayal, a slow simmer of secrets that clung to the air and scraped at her throat as she tore open the envelopes and faced what she had long feared. 

Sarah Grace stared silently, statements spilling across the counter like ash, numbers that belonged to other people now folded into her hands, miscounted, mislaid, misused. Smoke rose from the pan, thin and accusing, curling toward her like a finger tracing blame. She waved it off with a dish towel as if the air itself had caught her in the act. 

Outside, the cicadas were loud enough to drown a secret. The broken kitchen timer stared at her. Beyond the pines, Mill Haven held its breath. The mill crouched by the river, brick bleeding into red clay. A screen door slammed two houses down, and she knew whose it was without looking. The same dog barked. The same truck backfired on Main. She turned from the window before the smoke alarm could start, before the neighbors could smell what she had done.

She carried the pan out the back door, handle wrapped in a damp rag. The yard stretched wide and tired, grass worn to hard red clay where Robert's dog had run circles. From the shade, the dog lifted its head, ribs showing, dull coat, and trotted over with the sort of hope that didn't weigh her down.
She scraped the blackened edges into the bowl. Burnt meat and breading fell like ash. The dog didn‚Äôt care about the smoke, the numbers spilling from the envelopes inside, or the eyes of Mill Haven beyond the pines. It only wanted a scrap, a pat, a moment of something warm. She obliged briefly, letting her fingers brush its fur, then turned back toward the house.

A breeze caught the clothesline, white sheets moving like slow ghosts. Beyond them, the trees thickened, and farther still lay the old Montgomery plantation, hidden in green. She could almost hear the flies there, the long rot of the porch boards, the hush of things left unspoken.

The dog finished the bowl and thumped its tail once against the clay. She left the pan on the porch rail to cool and went back inside, carrying the hush of the yard with her.

James pressed against her side on the living room sofa, his weight familiar as prayer, his finger moving across the page of Green Eggs and Ham with the precision of someone conducting an orchestra only he could hear. He‚Äôd chosen this book for the fourth day running, though he could recite it perfectly without looking. The repetition wasn‚Äôt about the story, it was about counting, pattern, the certainty that page thirty-two always came after page thirty-one.
""Sam-I-Am,"" James read, his voice carrying that particular cadence he used when facts needed stating clearly. ""Would you, could you, in a car?"" His finger paused on the word ""car,"" traced it three times. Everything in threes today. Yesterday had been fours.

Through the bay window, Mill Haven‚Äôs October light painted the magnolia‚Äôs waxy leaves in shades of promise this town had never kept. The tree had stood there for ninety years, shading her grandmother‚Äôs wedding reception, witnessing three generations of Montgomery women learning to measure their worth in other people‚Äôs judgment.

Sarah Grace‚Äôs phone sat dark on the coffee table. Robert hadn‚Äôt called in six days. The silence felt less like abandonment than relief, one less voice measuring the distance between who she was supposed to be and who she‚Äôd become.
He‚Äôd said his income had dropped. The economy, he‚Äôd shrugged, eyes on the TV. But she‚Äôd smelled a different perfume on his shirts, something bright and expensive, nothing like her drugstore jasmine. Receipts had appeared in the pockets, restaurants in Raleigh, in Charlotte, nowhere near his company‚Äôs offices. He‚Äôd blamed clients. She‚Äôd stopped asking. The truth had its own stench.
He didn‚Äôt know about the credit-card statements, the overdrawn accounts, the careful way she‚Äôd been moving money from one place to another like a shell game that had finally run out of shells.

The Ladies‚Äô Auxiliary flowers still sat on the dining room table, gardenias going brown at the edges. She‚Äôd arranged them yesterday morning for the luncheon, before Margaret Henderson had smiled her thin smile and said, ""Such dedication to the scholarship committee, Sarah Grace. Though I hear the auditor found some interesting discrepancies in the quarterly report.""
She remembered sitting there just hours ago, spine straight as her grandmother‚Äôs silver, nodding as they discussed the Hendersons‚Äô daughter and her ""unfortunate condition."" The same girl whose college applications she‚Äôd helped with last fall. Before the pregnancy showed. Before the shame.
""Some situations require discretion,"" she‚Äôd said, voice low and certain. The other women had nodded ...pearls clicking like rosary beads counting sins. Not hers. Not yet..

Sarah Grace‚Äôs hand had trembled pouring tea. She‚Äôd known then. Known that the falsified records wouldn‚Äôt hold, that the money she‚Äôd ""borrowed"" and meant to pay back had been noticed, that eighteen months of careful juggling were about to crash down like the Montgomery crystal her grandmother had brought from Virginia, beautiful, fragile, devastating when it shattered.

Sarah Grace looked out the bay window. Mill Haven lay quiet in its October light, the streets and porches already aware of her missteps even before anyone spoke them. She had worn her compliance like armor, nodding through committee meetings, masking absences and errors, keeping Robert‚Äôs secrets tucked in her pocket, tending to the children, keeping appearances, making sure no one saw the cracks she had inherited, the sins she‚Äôd been left to take the blame for.

James turned the page. ""Eat them, eat them, here they are."" His finger found the rhythm again, tapping against each word. Three taps, pause. Three taps, pause.

The pot roast would be leather by dinner. The timer would stay broken. 

Somewhere, in an office she‚Äôd never seen, an arrest warrant with her name on it had been signed.

The knock came at 4:17 PM.
James‚Äôs tapping stopped.

The knock wasn‚Äôt tentative. Not the polite tap of a neighbor borrowing sugar or the friendly rhythm of Caroline dropping by with church gossip. This knock carried weight, the kind of business that made James‚Äôs fingers stop mid-tap on Dr. Seuss.
""Mama?"" His voice rose a half-step, pattern breaking. ""Someone's at the door at 4:17. That‚Äôs not the right time. Mrs. Peterson comes at 3:30. Mr. Richards from church comes at 5:15. Nobody comes at 4:17.""
Sarah Grace‚Äôs hand found his shoulder, squeezed once. Her palm was damp against his cotton shirt. ""Stay here, baby. Keep reading. I'll be right back.""
But James was already counting under his breath‚Äîone-two-three, one-two-three‚Äîrocking slightly. 

The foyer floor was heart pine, installed in 1923 when her great-grandfather built this house with textile money that had bought three generations of Montgomery belonging. Her bare feet made no sound. Through the sidelight window, she could see a uniform: two men, official blue against the fading October light.

Her breath caught. She‚Äôd known this was coming, since the audit began three weeks ago, since Robert left with his lawyer‚Äôs precision, taking the checkbook and leaving her with bills, a son whose therapy cost $400 a week, and a life built on Montgomery credit that had finally run out.

Her hand was on the doorknob. Brass, polished that morning. Warm. Alive.
She opened the door.

The taller man was mid-thirties, wedding ring, the posture of someone taught respect while learning to embody authority. ""Mrs. Sarah Grace Montgomery?""

Behind him, Mill Haven stretched across the October afternoon, indifferent to her collapse. Across the street, the Henderson house‚Äôs windows glinted like eyes.

""Yes,"" she said, voice steady, Montgomery training intact.
The second man was older, harder. Billy Wilson. She recognized the set of his jaw, the old resentment he'd carried since home coming, twenty-four years buried and freshly unearthed.¬†‚ÄúMa'am, we have a warrant for your arrest. Charges of embezzlement, fraud, and falsification of records. ""Charges of embezzlement, fraud, and falsification of records.""

The words fell like stones into still water, rippling through her chest. Eighteen months of moving numbers, telling herself she‚Äôd pay it back, now codified in law: stolen money, taken from children to preserve appearances.

From the living room: James. ""I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am."" His cadence continued, the world reduced to order he could impose, even as chaos exploded around him.

""May we come in?"" Martinez offered, tentative sympathy.

Procedures. Always procedures. The Montgomerys had them too, for appearance, for scandal, for containing damage when one of their own fell. None covered this.
They came back inside. James sat on the sofa, eyes distant, still counting, trying to rebuild pattern from wreckage.
""Mama."" His statement, not a question.
Sarah Grace knelt, taking his counting hand in both hers. Cool, slightly damp. He‚Äôd been stimming earlier. ""Mama has to go with these officers. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Arrest,"" he said. Precise. ""It‚Äôs when police take someone to jail because they broke a law. What law did you break?""
She swallowed. ""It‚Äôs complicated, baby. I made mistakes with money. Money that wasn‚Äôt mine.""
""You stole?"" His voice climbed. ""From who?""
""From the school fund,"" she admitted. Truth, at least.
He processed, his logic merciless. ""The money you said was for helping kids whose families don‚Äôt have enough? But we don‚Äôt have enough either. You told Dad we couldn‚Äôt afford the new trampoline because money was tight.""
The hypocrisy hit like lightning. She had stolen from children while telling her own they must sacrifice.

""Mimi is coming to get you,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll stay at her house tonight.""
""How many nights? One? Seven?"" His counting brain needed numbers to make sense.
""I don‚Äôt know yet, James. But Mimi‚Äôs house has your blue room, the right sheets, eggs scrambled with three shakes of salt.""
""Three shakes,"" he repeated, a prayer, a formula. His finger tapped back on the page.
Brooke appeared, graceful as smoke. Her face showed effort, reconstructing composure from tears. ""Mom? Did this‚Äîdid you really‚Äîthe scholarship money?""
""Yes."" Truth.
Her daughter‚Äôs eyes crumpled, then hardened. ""Katie Henderson‚Äôs mom was on that committee. Everyone knows.""
James pressed his hands to his ears, rocking slightly. Sensory overload.

""Ma‚Äôam,"" Martinez said gently. ""We need to proceed.""
Sarah Grace stood. Her knees protested; she felt ancient despite being forty-two. ""I love you,"" she whispered to James, Brooke, and the empty space where Marcus should be.
James continued counting: one, two, three‚Ä¶ pattern rebuilding itself from wreckage.

The handcuffs were colder than expected. Metal biting, final. Billy Wilson‚Äôs satisfaction radiated with every step. Margaret Henderson‚Äôs phone still raised, recording.
Sarah Grace recalled the scholarship committee, the Wilson girl denied, exhausted yet deserving.

The back seat of the patrol car smelled of industrial cleaners and human desperation. Wrong side of the mesh, she sat, watching Mill Haven‚Äôs streets pass: her house, the magnolia, the mailbox, James at the window, Brooke trying to pull him back.

Martinez guided her, gentle, precise. Billy beside her, words slicing: ""$85,000 stolen‚Ä¶ children denied help‚Ä¶ full consequences.""
""No,"" she whispered. ""I‚Äôm not ready.""
The engine started. Drive down Harris Street. Fifteen steps from porch to car felt like fifteen miles. Marcus froze mid-stride, bag over shoulder, witnessing. Margaret Henderson‚Äôs phone still recording, capturing every second.

At the station, she signed forms. Defendant. Accused. Charges:
	‚Ä¢	Embezzlement: $85,247.63
	‚Ä¢	Fraud: Multiple counts
	‚Ä¢	Falsification of records: Multiple counts
	‚Ä¢	Theft by taking: Felony amount

The cot, the metal toilet, the concrete floor, fluorescent hum. Arraignment tomorrow. Bond probable, conditions set by Billy Wilson.

Somewhere, James counted: $85,247.63 divided by children denied‚Ä¶ a mathematical reckoning of his mother‚Äôs crimes. 
Brooke processed betrayal differently, Marcus calculated distance from shame.

Sarah Grace closed her eyes.

‚ÄúDating‚Äù

It isn‚Äôt difficult but single folks make it incredibly difficult. 

Why? 

Because most single folks (married as well) LIE.

If I said ‚Äúare you a liar?‚Äù you‚Äôd say NO! 

If I asked ‚Äúdo you tell people THE TRUTH?‚Äù you‚Äôd say no (if you were honest).

I was on a date a few months ago and I was having coffee with this woman. Chatting was easy and it was a great conversation. 

I asked her ‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU FEAR? WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?‚Äù

She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a pretty big and deep question!‚Äù After a few ‚Äúummms‚Äù ‚Äúman this is tough‚Äù she finally said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really think I have any fears other than something happening to one of my kids.‚Äù 

Then she said ‚Äúwell what about you?! What do you fear?!‚Äù

I smiled but inside I said to myself ‚Äúthis is exactly why so many people are single and why so many marriages and relationships are superficial and failing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI fear never being seen, I have fears that no one will hold my heart and love me for me, I am afraid of snakes, something happening to my kids, etc etc) I have a lot of fears and shared quite a few with her. 

She looked at me like I had just spoken in Greek. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a man say he was afraid of not being seen.‚Äù

Fathom wanting to ‚Äúfind love.‚Äù 

Fathom wanting to have someone hold your heart, love you for you, be a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù for you to open up and see you for all that you are. WE ALL WANT AND DESIRE THIS!

Yet we LIE. 

We LIE to people we date. 

We share nothing. 

We play small.

We want to be seen naked and accepted yet we have 198 layers of bullshit on and sit here and complain ‚Äúthere are no good guys, no one will commit, people are so fake, chicks are all the same.‚Äù

Nah man, YOU ARE FUCKING LYING.

Anything other than truth is a LIE. 

It‚Äôs a distorted reality. 

Ladies, imagine this for a sec. 

You meet a guy and you lie to him, you play small, you say what you think he wants to hear to like you.

1odhw0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitionDanceTalk/comments/1odhw0x/daughter_leaving_dance/,Daughter Leaving Dance,"Hi everyone! My 9yo daughter started dance at 2 years of age. She loved dance and dancing in recitals. As she got older we noticed she was talented and really shined on stage. The first year she was old enough, she was invited by her studio to be a walk on to the competition team. They didn‚Äôt even have her audition with everyone else. We did a year of competition dance, but were having problems with her studio. They were extremely disorganized. We often did not know the name and location of the competition until the week before. This makes it very hard to book hotel rooms for out of town competitions. The director told us she would be ordering team jackets and bags, but they never arrived. We would pay for competitions and conventions and the day before were told they had decided not to go and our money would be put towards fees for the next competition. We asked if our daughter could be moved back to recreation classes only and the studio owner said no and that we had agreed to be on the competition team. 

Needless to say, at the end of that year we decided to go somewhere else. Our daughter still wanted to compete and dance. I did my research and found a great studio with a wonderful reputation. I enrolled our daughter and since we were new I didn‚Äôt expect much. We just went with the flow. Right away I noticed there was a definite clique and heirarchy at this studio. The moms were not friendly or welcoming at all. One mom literally yelled at me in the lobby about how I did my daughter‚Äôs bun and proceeded to walk over to my daughter and start roughly taking down her hair without asking me and I had to intervene and tell her to back off. This was a mom, not a teacher. I did bring this up to the studio owner and she said she would address it. But to date this mom still acts the same way. The moms yell at their daughters in the lobby and tell them to stretch and stay focused before class starts. One mom literally slaps her daughter‚Äôs leg if she isn‚Äôt lifting it high enough while we wait for class to start. I saw a mom push her daughter down really hard and rough while her daughter was practicing her splits to the point where her daughter yelled out in pain. Another mom took her daughter into the hallway and yelled at her in front of everyone for forgetting her dance. 

The girls were cliquish and my daughter was ignored and completely left out. They would literally push each other out of the way to make sure they were in the front row during class. My daughter isn‚Äôt like that so she would just go stand in the back. The teachers ignored my daughter and never gave her feedback or praise. I noticed one time that before class the teacher asked the girls what they did that weekend. My daughter spoke up and tried to talk and the teacher cut her off and started talking to another child. However, the instruction was really amazing and they were teaching my daughter skills that were never taught at her old studio, so we stayed. I tried to be positive and told my daughter it would just take time because we were new. 

My daughter was consistently placed in the back row far end of all dances. Again, at first we just accepted it and told ourselves we were paying our dues because she was new. However as the months went on I noticed that my daughter was at the same level as the rest of the class. There were some kids that were not as skilled and made multiple mistakes. However they were always placed front and center while my daughter had her regular spot in the back corner. I‚Äôm not demanding that my daughter be in the front for all dances. But after a while it would be nice for her to be in the front for at least one dance. 
We told the new studio that our daughter had experience in competition dance, but she was never invited to try out or be on their competition team. 

There is a student at this school (who just happens to be my daughter‚Äôs age) that gets everything. She is in every single recital dance and is front and center. Her mom will bring coffee and snacks everyday for the studio director and teachers. They are wealthy so her family donates a lot of money to the studio during fundraising. Her mom stands outside of the classes and gives her daughter corrections during classes and the teachers say nothing to her. During recitals no parents are allowed backstage, but she is always back there and she isn‚Äôt a volunteer.  Her daughter got a solo during the senior girls dance and she is nine years old. She is not a prodigy or super talented. In fact she fell onstage during her solo multiple times and made obvious mistakes. However, this child always receives special treatment. When she walks into the studio all of the teachers hug her and talk to her. She gets every  single award. She is in every single picture on the studio website and Facebook page. She has multiple solos during competition season. She gets special photography sessions with pictures that look gorgeous. When she had her birthday (which is a week before my daughter‚Äôs birthday) the studio owner took her into each class and had them stop dancing to sing happy birthday to her. No one even said happy birthday to my daughter. All of the teachers and studio owner went to her birthday party. They have already started her on pointe even though she is only nine years old. I have never seen favoritism like this, and all because her family is rich and donates a lot of money. However, my daughter doesn‚Äôt understand this and must be in the same class as this child, watching her get special treatment. 

The studio has an annual Nutcracker performance that my daughter wanted to try out for. She made the show and was so excited. When practices started she found out that they had decided to put her in the baker role. This role stands at the side of the stage and literally does no dancing the entire dance. She will hold a plate of cookies and smile. The other dance she got into she will be standing in the very back corner again. Now I know my child is not the best dancer in the room, but she also isn‚Äôt the worst. She is at the same level as everyone else. This is a child with seven years of dance and competition team experience. She shouldn‚Äôt be standing at the side of the stage watching the rest of the class dance. 

When we got into the car, my daughter broke down crying. She told me she wants to dance and doesn‚Äôt understand why the studio is treating her this way. She said she didn‚Äôt know if she wanted to take dance classes anymore. We noticed she is no longer happy after classes has started wanting to skip class altogether. Her sparkle is gone and she no longer looks happy on stage. One day she told us that she was the fattest kid in her dance class. We never discuss weight at home so she had to have heard this during dance class. Our daughter is not overweight at all and it shocked us to hear her say this about herself. 

After she told us that she was fat, my husband and I made the choice to pull her out of the studio. The studio didn‚Äôt even ask why we pulled her out. We asked if she wants to go somewhere else and she said no. We are so upset because she was such a great dancer and we feel our choice to move her to this studio has killed her self esteem and love of dance. I feel horrible for moving her and just want to see her happy and excited about dance again. Are all dance studios this chaotic? ",2,1761161124.0,CompetitionDanceTalk,3,1.0,False

Tl;Dr: We did not find the resort to be a good value and we're underwhelmed with the food and service.

We came to Palmaia House of Aia for a babymoon trip (5 nights) in October. This was very expensive for us so we had high expectations for the resort and service during our stay.

Pros:
- Clean, beautiful pools 
- Nice beach and pool lounge areas
- Kind staff
- Lots of wildlife and monkeys on property which is cool
- Good selection of exercise and creative classes

Cons:
- Food was overwhelmingly bland and lacking salt. Focus was on presentation and we were disappointed with 90% of food.
- We got sick multiple times during our stay and heard others were ill too
- Simple requests were denied or made overly complicated. While sick I thought the assigned guide might help us acquire medication for a cheap price but we were quoted $140. 
- property is so spread out that we did not go to the coffee shop because it was such a far walk. Literally a mile to dinner.
- Spa is absurdly expensive (nearly $400 for a massage)
- No lounge chairs on balcony to enjoy the outdoor space

1odhvx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1odhvx8/the_world_outside_tech_feels_depressing/,The World Outside Tech Feels Depressing.,"Does anyone feel like the ""real"" world outside of phones and social media is a depressing place now? 

As someone who has been scaling back heavily on phone usage and trying to spend more time outside as well as in coffee shops, public parks, and libraries, I feel like phones have ruined the entire concept of local culture and human interaction.

Maybe that's a bit dramatic or misidentifying the problem (I realize all socioeconomic issues can't be boiled down to just ""phone bad""), but leaving your house without your phone makes you see how beautiful the world is but how truly depressing it has become at the same time and I just want to rant about it for a bit. 

Sorry for the long post and I also recognize that this is might be more specific to my experience in a smaller town in the US. Visiting larger cities and other countries I have noticed a much less depressing world. 

Somehow the world feels completely overcrowded and unnervingly empty at the same time. When I was young I grew up in a small neighborhood surrounded by parks. Pretty much every day I would go out, knock on a friends door and go to parks. The parks would be crowded with kids, people walking dogs, people having picnics.

We used to talk about things that happened in our lives or community. Stories, family updates, complaints etc. Now most people talk about things they saw happen to other people: the latest memes and online jokes, crazy news from another city or country,  or some drama about something someone you don't know said or did. Most of the texts I get from family and friends are links to reels and TikTok's I'll never watch.

Beyond personal interactions, I feel like cities, parks, etc. just feel weird now. Like I live in a smallish town with a nice but very small downtown. The downtown area is often overcrowded with long waits for restaurants and no parking. Meanwhile a shopping center a block away is run down with half the buildings vacant.

So many small family owned places here have gone out of business in the past few years. There's nowhere for kids or adults to go anymore besides eating food or going to a bar. No bowling alleys, no arcades, nothing. They all closed down because why would you go there when you have a 65"" tv and a phone with every movie, game and tv show you could ever want at home?

And everything feels so crowded now at the same time because there's nowhere to go now. So when people do want to go out or get out of the house, they have many less options. I think the population has outgrown the amount of things to do and it's not being fixed because there's no demand for this stuff. There's no new fun businesses opening up because rent or land is too expensive to take a risk on something new or unique. 

Maybe this is just where I live but the parks are empty most days. The libraries are empty besides people using the computers. Most places are closed down and replaced with chains, if at all. The places that are open are overpriced and underwhelming. If you find something cool do to it gets hyped on social media and suddenly it's impossible to get into. 

On a recent group camping trip, everyone was watching sports on their phones. Scrolling feeds. No one was enjoying the space or peace and quiet. No one even was taking pictures or videos to post anymore because who posts anymore? They were just consuming. At night half the campsites had LED light shows and blasted loud music. It was really depressing and reminded me why I prefer primitive camping spots.

Other things I've noticed while I'm complaining:

* Parents on their phones while their young kids play alone on playgrounds or play on their iPad with oversized headphones in restaurants. 
* Advertisements. EVERYWHERE. On billboards, on buses, on park benches, on stakes in the grass, on gas pumps, Everywhere!
* Coffee shops and cafes removing seating to deter people from working and ""loitering""
* The same 5 boring building designs copied and pasted every 2 blocks
* QR code only menus. I will literally walk out of a restaurant
* Everything being ungodly expensive
* Giant streets with no sidewalk or crosswalk so you either have to dangerously j-walk or get in your car to literally go across the street
* AI images appearing on advertisements, company logos, posters etc.
* People rude to or skeptical of strangers
* Meetups, festivals, hobby clubs etc. only attended to by elderly folks or people with young children

I don't know. This is probably just a case of ""old man yells at cloud"" but the less I use tech and try to engage with the world, the more I feel like the world is somehow worse than it used to be and no one cares because they have screens to distract and entertain them. 

With our phones and the internet we all feel this false sense of connection. We see things online happening to others and we get a small bit of feeling like we did that too or that we were a part of it, but we weren't a part of anything. We were sitting alone in a room. It's enough connection drip fed to us that we don't go insane. Without phones and TVs we'd be chomping at the bit to get outside and away from the boring walls of our houses. We'd be sitting in parks, going bowling, talking to friends and family in person about our lives not other's lives.",9,1761161118.0,digitalminimalism,9,0.76,False

Now, here's Chapter 7: 'Rebirth on Ice' ...

The chilly weather and barren lifescape in Churchill, the small coastal town off the Hudson Bay in Manitoba, cleansed Tony Aldy of his unrelenting previous personal and professional life.

Instead, he was a cog in the machine, a brick in the wall, according to his favorite Pink Floyd song. Aldy merely listened to old rock music and stared down a long white line for hours on end in his new slave role as ice trucker.

He even embraced the local scene. Tony adopted a pet polar bear, named Norman, for protection. He joined the local men's softball league, regularly attended city hall meetings and became a volunteer member of the nearby nature preserve. At his best, you could hear Tony Aldy spinning a yarn at the Tundra Pub, retelling old war stories of skidding for miles or plunging into icy waters while making his trucking voyages. Somehow, he failed to bring up his reign as the ruler of a highly advanced California city-state. Oh well, that was another life ago.

Aldy's road trips were extraordinarily challenging and could last months. He once ventured all the way to Guatemala, he'd surfed landslides, seen six time zones, and he'd met folks of all kinds, including a rendezvous with a tavern wench who was having his latest child. He fell in love with the road and would listen to its hums in absolute silence for hours at a time when he felt the mood. Aldy once went 17 straight days without speaking during a month-long run of pickups and drop-offs in Alaska, but he did watch Ridley Scott's 1982 film¬†*Blade Runner*¬†every single evening during the trip.

Turkish coffee was a rare delicacy in the area, and Tony Aldy had brought it with him to Churchill after learning a recipe during a stay at some roadhouse up in the Yukon Territory. He started preparing several pots per day for his neighbors on days he was in town, but they demanded he start his own business.

Scared of taking on a side hustle and being in charge of his own enterprise, Aldy reluctantly partnered with his nearby flatmate and softball team captain, George Cooper. Standing 6-foot-4 and weighing exactly 292 pounds, with a helping of plain brown hair, and eyes of bedazzling beauty, Cooper was a gorgeously rotund but unmarried con man, by Aldy's judgment, who was doing a terrible job hiding a thick southern accent. Aldy did not know George was doing a much better job at hiding from his previous family, which had become the stars of a network sitcom.

""Welllll, we ought to do it Tony,"" George said, bracing his lips as he suckled on a brown bottle of beer. ""People love this sweet, sweet stuff,"" he sang to Aldy.

""Let's do it, big fella,"" Aldy told George as feelings of fear and excitement washed over him. ""And I was talking about the coffee, not the beer, by the way,"" George muttered and spanked Tony, shouting ""Ohh!"" before asking how his Tony Soprano impersonation was.

The men took out a small business loan from the Aldylantis Slave Payroll Corporation (ASPC) ‚Äî as George was also employed through them as the local football coach ‚Äî and opened an outdoor stand near Churchill's downtown strip. On days he was in Churchill, Aldy would stand shirtless and prepare his coffee each morning while listening to Bon Jovi's greatest hits.

The coffee stand, called Big Tony's, sprouted like spring flowers, jumping from a tiny shack to the largest business in the city in short order. Tony incorporated coffees and coffee recipes from all over North America and always brought back exotic tastes and inspirations from his lengthy road trips. Every person in the city drank Big Tony coffee at least once per day, while the building itself became a sort of social lounge for the city.

Over the next several months, Aldy developed deep personal connections with every person in the Churchill community and had a knack for considerate listening, serving as some sort of barista-turned-therapist. Older mariners would gripe about the consolidation of the Port of Churchill under indigenous rule, claiming it was better off under the national umbrella. He also realized just how central the railroad was to the town's economy, since he was apparently the only ice road trucker capable of navigating his way to and from Churchill, while most goods were shipped by rail. Despite their small town, Churchill could be a force of trade on the Hudson Bay and worked itself into several important bills during the Canadian-American tariff wars. However, Tony eyed greater potential.

Aldy stepped up big time to get Churchill back into the major shipping game. He campaigned during his ice trucking runs, seeking out whichever members of the senate and house of commons he could find, as well as local business owners, trying to convince them to re-run more shipping routes through Churchill.

""Come on guys, we're the Gem of Manitoba!"" Aldy bellowed at a town hall meeting in an Inuit hamlet called Rankin Inlet, located several hundred miles north of Churchill on the Hudson Bay coast. He posted signs and purchased billboards everywhere he went with his face plastered as large as it could be to fit on the page, while the Crest of Churchill was imprinted on his forehead. Of course, Tony did have the Crest of Churchill branded onto his actual forehead... a polar bear with the carcass of a bald eagle in its teeth.

The town was so impressed with Aldy that locals began chattering about him running for Mayor of Churchill. Current mayor Neil Young didn't want to deal with that nonsense, though, and suggested that ""paranoia ought to be striking deep in our local community when it comes to this coffee magnate"" on his next television interview.

Aldy hated smug politicians like Young who believed they were above the law. Here was a guy who hardly cared for the betterment of his community thinking he ought to remain in charge.¬†*What a twisted world*, Tony thought, and saw why he must run for office despite his reluctance for power.

The mayoral race was a powder keg for the town. Young was staunchly old-school and believed that shipping expansion would threaten the peace and quiet that he came to Churchill for in the first place. Meanwhile, Aldy was beginning to have illusions of grandeur. Some folks certainly sided with Young, but they were in the minority after Aldy's campaign officially launched and he promised to ""blow gold all over Churchill.""

Aldy had scheduled a July 4th rally. Debuting a new mustache and top hat, he rode his polar bear from Big Tony's coffee shop all through the downtown as fireworks shot off in the distance and everyone drank his coffee, which was only slightly laced with LSD, his communion gone psychedelic. Parade-goers stared bullets through Tony as he pulled his megaphone to his mouth and began to explain his vision for Churchill while saddled on trusty old Norman:

""Thank you so much for visiting with me,"" Aldy thundered. ""Now, I've traveled over half our city to be here and see about this mayoral position. I dare say some of you have heard the more extravagant rumors about what my plans are. I just thought you'd like to hear it from me. This is the face. There's no great mystery.""

""I'm a coffee man,"" he went on. ""I have many wells flowing producing many pots per day. As a real coffee man, I hope you'll forgive my old-fashioned plain speaking. This work we do... is very much a family enterprise. I work side by side with my wonderful partner, George Cooper. You might have met him already.""

George Cooper huffed and puffed and then smiled to steal the hearts of overweight women all over the city.

""The day I take office, 800 men will arrive,"" Tony continued, clapping his hands together for effect. ""They'll erect new apartments, businesses, bridges, ports, most importantly, roads for transport. We'll hire more ice truckers and move much more product.""

""Yes,"" he hissed, ""this is what we'll do."" Aldy pinpointed one other major issue: drugs.

""Let's talk about dugs,"" he stated. ""Now to my mind, it's an abomination to consider that any man, woman or child in this magnificent city of ours should have to look upon methamphetamine as a luxury. We're going to raise marijuana crops here, plant poppy seeds. You're going to have more heroin than you know what to do with. Crack will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am. New pills, agriculture, employment, relaxation, expansion of the mind ‚Äî these are just a few of the things we can offer you. This community of yours will not only survive under my dictation, it will flourish!""

Tony Aldy snarled as his fans surrounded him and coalesced into one hive crowd, and he chanted whatever came to his mind while everyone repeated him until the sun rose and it was time for Big Tony's coffee shop to open.

Neil Young dropped out of the mayor's race and moved down to Winnipeg that evening. The next day, Aldy was woken up with breakfast (and coffee) in bed and escorted to the mayor's office by townsfolk who were beaming with excitement over the dawn of greater horizons in Churchill.

Several months later... the Manitoban skies above Churchill were covered in the secretion of Big Tony's fleet of enormous cooling towers located toward the back of its five-square-block campus, which looked more like an industrial steel mill than the largest coffee emporium in North America. Meanwhile, Churchill residents lined up like drones at 7:32 AM on the dot each morning to unvoluntarily suck down their cups of tasteless brown liquid that was devoid of the personality that they once cherished in Big Tony coffee.

George Cooper, standing in the middle of the building on a Wednesday morning, swallowed hard and tried for 45 straight minutes¬†*not*¬†to cry. He jerked his head around as he reckoned with the slide into madness from his business and political partner.

Enormous walls dominated the city, blocking off the various avenues of industrial transportation ‚Äî lanes for oil pipelines, many lanes for ice truckers, still plenty of railroad lanes, an expanded airport that required the guard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Every facet of the city served one goal: Tony Aldy's thirst for conquest of Canadian trade.

In fact, Tony had recently insisted that Churchill and the surrounding area be sliced off from the mainland and fastened into an island, which he decided to rename 'Tony Island.' Having grown far too locally powerful, he turned his enslavement back on the ASPC agents and ran his power flip up the flagpole to let Lightfoot know that he was running the show of a robust and growing personal powerhouse in northern Canada.

Soon, many slave hands flowed into Tony Island, arriving by barge at a special port before they were dumped into a sorting facility at Big Tony's coffee. One day, former United States President Trevor Amback and former Aldylantis CPA and Lakers star Dave Ramsey popped through.

""Bubby!"" Aldy yelped at Amback after he came hot off the slave assembly line in Big Tony's. ""You're my white knight!"" Amback screeched at Aldy as their bodies clanked together like a pair of beer glasses during a big cheers.

""I've missed you, Mr. President,"" Aldy told Amback, who locked his jaw for five minutes and stared with gratitude at his old friend. ""Don't bother with those honorifics any longer,"" he told Aldy, who puckered his lips in confusion before realizing... ""Oh, right, we're in Canada.""

""No, you wretched idiot,"" snapped Amback, whose mustache caught on fire, which Tony knew only happened when Amback became enraged. ""I was stripped of my title, auctioned into slavery. I flipped pancakes for a trillionaire oil baron,"" Amback cried out before hushing his tone. ""Some teenage prince in Saudi Arabia.""

""Lightfoot?"" Tony asked. ""Yes! It was he who sent me to my penance,"" Amback cried out as he dropped to his knees and a lush piano score kicked in out of nowhere. Just then, Dave Ramsey somersaulted into the conversation and Tony Aldy literally choked on the chicken wing he was eating. As his form collided with the ground, a sonic boom was created, which Ramsey took as a sign of peace.

""What happened to you after we were separated at the Ohio Valley slave port?"" Amback asked Ramsey as Aldy shot a bone out of his throat which reached terminal velocity and sniped the brain of an assembly line worker on the other side of the facility. ""Rats,"" he cursed.

Ramsey suggested the men sit down in comfortable chairs for the next several hours as he weaved them his tale of shipment off to Africa and his settlement in Marrakesh, Morocco, where he was enslaved as a fast-and-loose street accountant in the local spice trade. Bartering was more intense, deadly, and operatic in the narrow corridors of the Marrakesh medina than anywhere in the world. He noted that white folks in Marrakesh were almost exclusively enslaved as lowly middle managers and accountants since they obviously could not comprehend or handle the pace of action on the dirt streets below.

Ramsey joked that he'd learned more about deal-making and finance from a year in Marrakesh than he did in decades as a financial guru on American airwaves. ""I was depressed to be leaving the most propulsive chapter of my professional life, but so overjoyed to once again be enslaved by Tony Aldy,"" Ramsey told him.

""I'll catch up with you boys in a little bit,"" Aldy abruptly spewed as he left the conversation and jumped into the ocean out back of his castle on Tony Island, swimming clear across the Hudson Bay to empty his mind and reflect on a depressingly nostalgic catch-up with Amback and Ramsey. On his way back, he dialed up a new grand master plan and then promptly dialed up George Cooper from his conch shell.

Cooper answered his own conch shell and Aldy's voice maimed his ears out of the other side: ""I've come with a swell idea!"" his voice seared into Cooper's spine. ""I'll be over right now!""

Aldy crashed down several flights of stairs into George Cooper's basement and hollered, ""What's up, cowboy?"" as he bounced up like a Weebil-wobble, breaking out into a defensive stance.

""It's time for a hoops team in this boring ass wasteland,"" Tony then told George. ""I'm sick and tired of all this mustard talk,"" he continued. ""Accounts receivable here. Tax code violations there. Smarmy democrats trying to pour ketchup all over my eggs. I'm sick of organizing organizations. I just want to ball!""

George Cooper couldn't believe his ears, which had just leapt off of his face and onto the floor. ""That sounds delightful,"" he said as he collected them. ""But what do you and I know about basketball?""

Aldy bowed his head to George and then walked over and wrapped his pulsing, bulbous forearms around the back of George's neck and said to him, intimately: ""There is no sports coach in this world I respect more than Rick Pitino... But you're probably third behind him and Rick Carlisle.""

¬†

**Memory Transcription Subject: Cruth, Krev Exchange Program Participant.**

Date \[*Standardized human time*\]: January 2, 2161

I struggled to make my way through the packeted streets heading for the space port, the plenitude of other Krev here was mind boggling to me. Today was the day that the ship bound for Earth leaves, well in a few hours anyway.

The media was a flurry of posts saying for the humans not to go, that they had a life here and if they went back, we would miss them. I probably would have been the same way, thinking that there was no point in them going back a few months ago.

‚ÄúAlright, you‚Äôre clear.‚Äù The guard said as I finally stepped out of the thought scanner grabbing my bag off the conveyor belt they had set up.

Eventually making it into the space port proper, I was greeted with a massive atrium of architecture rivalling that of the delegates tower in Tonvos. Multiple floors, the lights set up everywhere near seating areas, and a few little exhibitions dotted around the place.

First, I needed to find the terminal that was handling the on-boarding process for Group E, both Edward and Breeve were already here from what I knew, I called them when I left my apartment.

The noise from outside was atrocious, the fact that somehow the crowds outside were more audible than the shuttles taking off with passengers or cargo was somehow possible. At least in here it was air conditioned and not so noisy, in fact it was too quiet.

I walked forward into the building finding an interactive holo-board showing the layout of the spaceport. I doubled checked the Terminal I needed to go to on my pad before using a claw to find the place on the map. I selected it before my pad dinged, now showing a route, I needed to take to get to the correct terminal.

I looked around again to see why it was so quiet and could only see a handful of people, some of them human and a few others were Krev. The humans were wearing what looked like their militia gear and the krev seemed to be Guards.

‚ÄòThe place must be high on security right now.‚Äô

I followed the indicated route to the terminal finding very little presence of anyone except those that were either Guards or militia. Every so often I caught a glimpse out of a window down onto the shuttle landing areas and saw loading drones and the occasional worker wearing high vis directing them.

It was eery from when I first came here, the rush of people and cheery faces of my own kind. The gossip and the quick glances at humans whenever anyone saw them. It was off putting only hearing my footsteps and the ventilation above me despite everything going on outside.

At some point someone or a group of people decided that they needed to stage a protest against the ship leaving, ‚ÄúThat it was too dangerous for the humans too leave.‚Äù I just couldn‚Äôt understand why they were doing this, that people out there now wanted the humans trapped here like a walk in exhibit just to gawk at them.

‚ÄòThe exact opposite of when we were trying to force them to leave.‚Äô

The crowd assembled outside was here for that reason and a few others, probably about the ship only taking exchange partners and not everyone else who wanted to go. I passed by another window and saw that they now had signs in Krev script asking for the human to please not leave.

‚ÄòHow kind of them.‚Äô

Picking up the pace to get away from the madness outside, I soon started hearing some sort of commotion meaning that there was at least someone around. I checked the map and saw that I was going in the right direction and rounded a corner to see a plethora a human and Krev talking amongst each other near a gate.

I didn‚Äôt recognise any of them from the brief introduction from before and guessed they weren‚Äôt part of the group I was with. I walked past the gate and nothing really seemed odd about those people, they seemed like normal exchange partners excited to go home and experience a new culture.

I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt a little excited my self. The opportunity to go and visit Earth is like a fantasy novel come true. Smart primates that were actually real and just as adorable as Obors, younger me would either believe it existed with no proof or just flat out said that it wasn‚Äôt possible.

Trudging on, I passed by the next three gates it seems the same layout for seating but I noticed a few humans that seemed bored sitting next to their exchange partner, some even glaring at them with hatred in their eyes as the krev tried to talk to them. Why would they even be in the exchange program if they have that look when being near us?

The next gate should be gate E, but I saw that it was at the very end of the terminal wing, it left me wondering where the humans going home by themselves are boarding, or maybe they had to be separated from us for whatever reason.

‚ÄòProbably because of some of the vitriol they have against us.‚Äô Remembering back to the fight with the humans.

Finally after reaching the gate I was greeted with a shriek and talking, I remember most of the people here from a few days ago. Some were wearing the same clothes like the bald human with the sunglasses and the Krev copying him, though the pair with the regal looking outfits had changed to what seemed like over the top suits with little triangles sticking out of their breast pockets.

Looking around I didn‚Äôt see Breeve or Edward anywhere, they must have been somewhere around here since the shuttles would be leaving soon. I worked up the courage entering the seating area and approached the most normal-ish looking pair.

The human was wearing a purple jumper with some sort of human script I wasn‚Äôt familiar with emblazoned on the front. It seemed that he was looking around while his partner was currently hugging their arm as if it was a small plushie that or trying to rip the appendage off. He didn‚Äôt seem to mind though as he saw me approaching and smiled widely at me.

‚ÄúHello there.‚Äù He said in a funny accent.

‚Äúu-um hi.‚Äù I waved a paw unsteadily back at him, not expecting a human to be so open immediately and the smile reached his ears which was weird.

‚ÄúIs there anything you need? Or do you want to sit down.‚Äù He asked, the Krev next to him glaring daggers at me and moved her tail in a way that she can spray me before looking up at the human and going doughy eyed.

‚ÄúUh- yeah, do you know where Bree-‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, go away, you‚Äôre not going to take this one from me.‚Äù The krev interrupted, somehow managing to clutch tighter to the human.

‚ÄúNow now, what did we talk about other Krev, Yelandri?‚Äù The human asked turning to the clingy Krev.

‚Äú‚Ä¶That not all of them want to take away your friends.‚Äù They said sullenly trying to coddle up to the human even more.

‚ÄúGood, now what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù He turned asking me.

‚ÄúCruth, and you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúEmil Bowman and this is Yelandri, my exchange partner.‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúYou can go find your own human, this one is mine. I like the way he‚Äôs so cuddly and cute and adorable and tall an-.‚Äù She said quickly but more of a jab before nuzzling her head against Emil‚Äôs shoulder and started muttering words under her breath, I blocked her out and tried to focus on conversing with Emil.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, we only got here a few minutes ago. Maybe someone else could help, I‚Äôm sorry that I couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, thank you anyway.‚Äù I said turning away and finding another pair to ask.

My options weren‚Äôt looking great though, all of them seemed a bit, I don‚Äôt know, weird, I guess. The one with the little note pad paper sticking out of them was here but they seemed a little preoccupied by the human next to them drawing something.

At the back of the waiting area the bald human wearing the black jacket with their partner wasn‚Äôt doing anything, but they looked like they didn‚Äôt want to talk to me.

‚ÄòAnd they looked a little scary to me.‚Äô

The ones with the wig seemed even scarier with the look they both gave me. I didn‚Äôt see anyone else that seemed like they wouldn‚Äôt be interrupted by me asking them so I chose the next pair I found.

The ones wearing the matching suits.

‚ÄúUm, hi there. You wouldn‚Äôt happen to know where Breeve is, the overseer for group E?‚Äù I asked standing next to them.

They both turned their heads to look at me, the Krev still wearing a monocle and the human tapping a walking cane on the ground. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the human‚Äôs fur was slicked back with some sort of gel and they outstretched fur above their upper lip ending in a little curl at either end.

‚ÄúI can say that I have. Yes, I saw her and a human earlier. Thomas, would you have happened to have seen wear they went? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not quite sure.‚Äù The Krev said in a grandiose accent that I couldn‚Äôt help but feel awkward near.

‚ÄúI think it was that room over there, dear boy, but I must ask you. Why you would want to see the overseer, it appears to me you have, and I say this in the most polite terms possible, no partner with you.‚Äù Thomas turned and nodded making the Krev next to them nod as well before turning to me.

‚ÄúThe human with them, is my partner.‚Äù I said back.

‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù Thomas said before standing up and straighten out his pelts.

‚ÄúAh, where are my manners, my name is Thomas, Thomas Milton.‚Äù He said bowing deeply at me with a flourish of his arm before straightening out again offering an outstretched gloved hand.

I gently took it and shook before releasing the delicate feeling garment.

‚ÄúThis is my partner, Isently. He gestured to the Krev who repeated the same action, though not as fine as Thomas did but I couldn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúIt is a pleasure to meet you Mr Cruth.‚Äù Raising themselves after saying my name. ‚ÄúNow, I believe that we must have some business to discuss to. So I bid you adieu and fare luck.‚Äù They spoke before I turned around and headed for the door they pointed out.

‚ÄòWhat in the universe was that?‚Äô

I reached the door after a few strides and opened it shutting it behind me as quickly as possible letting out a breath as I did so. The room was a small office, a desk with a tired looking Krev behind it and a sleeping Edward in one of the plush chairs sat in the corner.

‚ÄúAhh, Cruth.‚Äù Breeve said looking up from her holopad. ‚ÄúI was starting to get worried you wouldn‚Äôt be here in time.‚Äù She said staring up at me from the desk, dark bags under her eyes.

‚ÄúThe crowds outside the port are hard to get through.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôve been watching the news this morning and it seems the whole city is out today to either say goodbye or to try and keep us here.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom what I saw out there, it must be the whole city. Do we need to worry about them breaking in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to, the Tellus militia was deployed to deal with the crowds, I think there was a few people who wanted to try and force their way onto the shuttles for departure.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? What would the plan be when they were found in the head count?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just that I now have to take meticulous notes on everyone‚Äôs movement here.‚Äù She said taking a sip of a beverage next to her, the faint smell leading to believe it must have been coffee or something.

I turned to the sleeping form of Edward his head backward, arms crossed as he lounged in the chair, his legs outstretched. There was a bag next to him, and I remembered mine and sat it down pulling a chair over as I did so.

‚ÄúHow long has he been sleeping for?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout an hour or so, he needs it, and I didn‚Äôt want Krev gawking at him while he does.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the reason your in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty much, he needs the sleep and frankly so do I, but we‚Äôll be leaving in‚Ä¶‚Äù She checked the time. ‚ÄúAbout twenty minutes give or take, I‚Äôll need to do another head count to make sure everyone is here.‚Äù She got up from her chair and moved around the desk.

‚ÄúCould you look after him while I‚Äôm checking? I don‚Äôt want to leave him alone right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will, but why are you being so cautious right now?‚Äù I asked turning to look at Edward.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs having a rough time recently, right now is the only sleep he got I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was getting better?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is, it‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll let him explain it to you; it would probably be better for him if he does. I‚Äôll be back as soon as possible or be ready to go when the boarding commences.‚Äù And with that she left the room in silence closing the door behind her.

I took stock of what was in the room, there was a small window, a desk, some comfy chairs and a fluorescent light fixture that buzzed slightly. That and the soft breathing of Edward, I looked over at the human and saw the rise and fall of his chest. It was adorable the way his little snoozes came and went.

I fidgeted with my claws looking around distracting myself from the cute sleeping human in the room and the thought of petting the fur on top of his head. I grabbed my holo pad off my belt and decided to see if there was any change in the news or plans for boarding.

I skimmed over the document again and it just showed the same timeline, of boarding the shuttle at our assigned gates, the shuttle takes half an hour to reach the ship and then we‚Äôre off loaded at the correct sectors docking port.

Apparently, the ship was retrofitted to be a cruise ship for civilians on holiday. Looking at the history of the vessel showed that it was once a ship put on standby for evacuations before being decommissioned and refitted to be a long-haul civilian passenger ship.

‚Äò**Built for luxury and safety**.‚Äô The headliner said in bold writing.

I quickly scanned through the ships details and found the amenities section.

Reading through the list seeing that it was the same as some of the top-of-the-line space cruisers had, a lot of it was geared toward human physiology. A gym, parks, rock/tree climbing. A lot of physical exercise activities as well, I guess.

¬†Consortium still wasn‚Äôt curling up on us, showing their hospitality even though we wouldn‚Äôt be coming back for a long time.

I went through the list again and saw some other things that interested me, like a zero G section of the ship, I had never experienced it before, but it was something I would like to try eventually. I‚Äôd need to ask Edward if he‚Äôd be interested in doing that with me.

Looking through the details of the ship again, just showed how massive it was. Multiple floors, a viewing gallery, cafeteria and I thought I saw a swimming pool mentioned at one point, probably for the Ulchids.

I heard a snort and the sleeping human shot up with a start looking around before relaxing again.

‚ÄúYou, okay?‚Äù I asked him a little worried about the force he woke up with.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù He rubbed the side of his mouth before groggily asking. ‚ÄúHow long was I out for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just got here maybe ten minutes ago.‚Äù I said as he sat up looking around again. He seemed tired.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd Breeve go?‚Äù He said rubbing his eyes now and stretching, the overwhelming instinct to pet the cute primate was all consuming as he stretched, I could here a few bops and only made me want to pinch him more. It was too adorable watching them waking up and to think I get to see it for however long this trip last-

I stopped the thoughts as best I could, he doesn‚Äôt need to be treated like this, it could set of bad trauma for him, but I couldn‚Äôt help but rewatch him stretching in my head again.

‚ÄúUm, Cruth?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sorry about that, sort of just zoned out.‚Äù I admitted, but not wanting to say what I was thinking.

Edward got up grabbing his own holopad off the desk, before pocketing it and grabbed his bag and slung it over his shoulder.

‚ÄúCome on, we gotta start getting ready to go.‚Äù

I grabbed my own bag and proceeded to follow him out only bumping into his back as he held the door handle. I stepped back saying sorry before I heard him deliberately ¬†breathing slowly and opened the door.

The door moved and revealed multiple pairs of exchange partners from before getting ready to go, Breeve standing a few meters away from the door most likely intending to come and get us. I noticed that there were few extra pairs in the waiting area probably only getting here after me and cutting it a little close to departure.

‚ÄúAh, good. I was about to get you guys because we need to go now.‚Äù She said urgently.

‚ÄúWait, why?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThe front entrance had a break in; someone was able to get past security and then the whole crowd got through. The higher ups said that we should board now and not wait for the delays any longer.‚Äù Breeve said checking to make sure she had everything.

The tourism expert seemed frazzled by everything going on while I was just confused. The airport was completely dead when I walked through it and the security was everywhere, the fact that somehow the crowd made it through and got to here just didn‚Äôt make sense to me.

‚ÄúRight, lead on.‚Äù My exchange partner said signalling Breeve to walk to the gate entrance as we followed along.

I couldn‚Äôt help but look at some of the other exchange pairs here, some of them were talking normally to each other, but it only made the others stand out. A new pair I saw was a human lady with some sort of imitation Krev scale as‚Ä¶ identification tags? Why on Tellus would they ever do that to themselves, sure it was cute but, why?

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Edward turned to see why I was poking him.

‚ÄúUm, I thought humans didn‚Äôt like being treated as Obors?‚Äù I said pointing out the pair.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt, she‚Äôs just wearing earrings, made‚Ä¶ from your scales‚Ä¶‚Äù It seemed he was also at a loss for words.

‚ÄúBut, then why is she wearing those tags marker?‚Äù

‚ÄúTag markers? The earrings? Um, it‚Äôs just a fashion thing we have.‚Äù

They did!?

We reached the gate a Krev standing behind a desk looked to Breeve before she flicked an affirmative using her tail. The gate doors opened automatically as Breeve turned to speak.

‚ÄúAlright, I want everyone‚Äôs attention. We are now boarding the space shuttle and docking at sector E, you all should have received a communication regarding the layout of the ship and the quarters where you will be staying. If you have not, I would recommend asking me or other staff for directions.‚Äù She stated loudly over the conversations as a PA system announced that the shuttles were now boarding.

‚ÄúNow, please if you would kindly proceed in an orderly fashion to your assigned seats, I will be taking a finale headcount before we leave.‚Äù She said standing to the side letting the group start down the connecting corridor to the shuttle, me and Edward staying behind to not get caught up in the crowd and not to panic.

‚ÄúSo, humans have earrings for fashion?‚Äù I asked being a little bewildered still.

‚ÄúYeah, did you not know?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, sort of. I know about jewellery and stuff from Jessica telling me about it, but I didn‚Äôt think that humans would modify their own skin with piercings.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry what?‚Äù Breeve asked taking her attention away from the pairs, typing something in her pad like a checklist.

‚ÄúCruth was wondering about why humans have piercings because he saw someone with Krev scales as fashion.‚Äù He said back.

‚ÄúOh, I see.‚Äù She said watching as the human with the Krev scales walked past like it was nothing. I could see a few other Krev walking near the woman glance at the odd fashion choice before returning to doing what ever.

‚ÄúOh, oh see that, can I do that?‚Äù The krev from earlier Yelandri said still hanging on Emil‚Äôs arm that much, he may as well be carrying her.

‚ÄúCalm down a little, it‚Äôs a big decision to get a piercing.‚Äù He said back gently patting the Krev on the head receiving a small coo in return her tongue flitting a little as he scratched her head.

The three of us watched as they entered the corridor, not speaking as the last pair entered. It left me thinking though.

‚ÄúEdward, did you ever have a piercing?‚Äù I asked curious if he did or not considering how much trouble he got up to when he was younger from the stories Micheal told me.

‚ÄúUm, yeah I did.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did?‚Äù Breeve asked now looking over Edward seeing if there were any tags on him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have it now, but I had my ear pieced when I was fourteen, never wore anything since then though. It‚Äôs just a hassle keeping track of the tiny things.‚Äù He said angling the right side of his head for me to see a tiny indent on the earlobe. ‚ÄúProbably healed by now anyway.‚Äù

I imagined him with ears rings and thought it was adorable, now with the human‚Äôs customisation of different jewels or patterns of hand wear was astonishing. If that equated to earrings as well, then it would be even cuter.

I heard a little squee come from the tourism expert and a confused look come from the staff behind the desk.

‚ÄúI need to see those photos Edward, I need to see those and the ones of you as a baby. I‚Äôm sure they would be the most adorable things to ever exist.‚Äù She spuecked quickly before regaining her composure.

Edward sighed before answering. ‚ÄúSure, but let‚Äôs just get settled first.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a promise then?‚Äù She asked seeming a bit livelier than before.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù He answered before started walking behind the crowd as Breeve stayed behind to finish something with the staffer.

I had to ask.

‚ÄúCan I also see the photos?‚Äù Fidgeting with my claws as I did so, hoping to not upset my friend.

‚ÄúSure, but only if you show me your own, I can‚Äôt be the only embarrassed one out of the three of us.‚Äù

**Memory Transcription Subject: Arthur Hamilton, UN Veteran.**

Date \[*standardized human time*\]*:* January 2, 2161

I couldn‚Äôt sleep, everyone but me and the new kitten was sleeping and even then the little fluffball was purring away as I stroked it‚Äôs back as it sat beside me.

I‚Äôd repeated the same routine for the past week now, my thoughts not being able to calm down with everything going on and what could happen. My son, my wife, I don‚Äôt know if the term was still applicable anymore, they could both be coming back here.

I wanted to jump for joy, scream at everything happening and another part that just was thinking about everything constantly.

The little black and white kitten named Ashy yawned a little taking me out of my thought pattern. I leaned back as the kitten licked its lips before settling again. I didn‚Äôt know what to think of the little thing, The present that Pelera wanted to keep secret was the little kitten she got from a friend of hers, apparently it was a gift to the whole family even though Ashia was still wary around the little thing.

It brought me back to thinking again about what to do, the news broke that the Ark survivors are going to be coming back here, that apparently, they are the ones responsible settling on the Sivkit‚Äôs home world and then firing at them when they wanted it back. The whole war was because of us.

I used a hand to rub at my face, it‚Äôs been a long time since I had even thought about war and the causes of it. That part of life is gone and finished, I wasn‚Äôt a soldier anymore, but I still worry like one.

What can I do? What could happen? What has happened? The reasons for it? How to plan for it?

Just everything at once again and I was at a loss for what to do. I still hadn‚Äôt approached the subject with anyone else yet and if Edward or Emilia show up, what then?

I needed to talk to them about this, I needed to make arrangements to make sure everything went smoothly but from every experience I have. It never goes to plan.

The thought reminded me of old times when I still served the UN and gave me an idea. I grabbed my pad and found the contact of an old friend. I pressed the call button hoping that he was still up at this time, even though it‚Äôs midnight here, they could be off world somewhere.

The pad called showing my own face before it abruptly showed a Zurulian on the other end. White hairs marking around the ears and a stern look on their face.

‚ÄúUnipher, how are you?‚Äù I asked cheerily seeing how annoyed they were.

‚ÄúYou damn well have a good reason for calling me Arthur, I‚Äôm in the middle of work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat work, all I ever saw you do is wait around until one of us fell over and you put a hello kitty plaster on it and said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre all better‚Äô.‚Äù I said back calling back to a few times.

‚ÄúHello ki- look what ever that is, I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt make sense, like most of what you say human.‚Äù He said backing looking around.

He fumbled the camera a little as it fell showing that he was wearing a little lab coat, the shoulder of it coming into frame before he regained control.

‚ÄúI take it that this isn‚Äôt a social call. What is it that you need?‚Äù

‚ÄúStraight down to business, you never really change when on duty. Do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid not, now what is it?‚Äù

I still found it hard to ask, I knew Unipher, we were deployed together, helped people and went through struggles and why is it so damned hard to ask for a little help now. My voice caught in my throat and came out a whisper. Unipher turned an eyebrow up on the side facing eyes, turning his head even to get a closer look at the screen.

‚ÄúI need a favour to ask?‚Äù My voice was low, and I struggled a little to ask.

‚ÄúAnd that would be?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already heard the news, I‚Äôm sure you can make the connection.‚Äù

He pondered for a moment one of his cub like ears twisting as he did so before a shocked look appeared on his face.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean, your family?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never said which Ark ship they were on, are you sure it‚Äôs them?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Uni, they were on number three and now there‚Äôs a possibility they could be coming back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do? Find a way for you to get on a ship heading for Tinsas?‚Äù He was probably remembering all the times I was complaining or saying how I‚Äôd track down Ark 3 and bring them back myself when we had R&R.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ how do I even put this? Is there anyway, with your credentials to get a list of everyone coming back here, the humans on board? I need to know if Emilia and Edward are coming here.‚Äù I asked my voice still quiet out a little.

Unipher‚Äôs ears swivelled again as he looked around before typing at something on his keypad setting the pad down facing him. He took a moment as I waited anxiously for an answer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not entirely sure what I can do from my end, I don‚Äôt have a high enough clearance to see any plans for what will be happening. But I will volunteer for the expedition ship going toward Consortium space. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to get something from there; I‚Äôll call when I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks Teddy.‚Äù I said slyly

Unipher‚Äôs face blanked at the comment before his ears pinned back and a snarl crept up on his lip.

‚ÄúI can still say no you know. It was over a decade ago now, why do you insist on bringing it up?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs funny and seriously, thank you for this.‚Äù I got serious to avoid him deciding to not help.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt change at all, even after all these years, you‚Äôre insufferable.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you to Uni.‚Äù I replied to his sassiness with a over enthusiastic voice.

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll see what I can get done on my end and send what ever information I have to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, and where are you by the way? Last time we spoke you were helping with the reclamation of biosphere on the Cradle?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill am, biology and nursing are my forte but I‚Äôm starting to find geoscaping a bit boring.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like I gave you the perfect excuse to get away from it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did.‚Äù He said propping an elbow on the desk and held his head up.

‚ÄúWanna see what Pelera got us for Christmas?‚Äù I asked wanting to show him the kitten sleeping against me.

‚ÄúOh please, do tell, was it socks or a new lab coat, seems like every human I know sent me one.‚Äù He said boring not moving his position.

I move the pads camera down to show the little ball of fur off to Uni.

‚ÄúOh no, p-please don‚Äôt let it g-get out, it could rampage and k-k-kill everyone.‚Äù He said mockingly like some of the Federation civilians we had to help. ‚ÄúCute cat, and Pelera got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Ashia coping with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alright, doesn‚Äôt know what to think of it and sort of doesn‚Äôt like being left alone with them.‚Äù

We continued talking for a while, the clock on my pad showing that it was nearly half past midnight before I said I had to call the conversation to an end.

‚ÄúI have to go, I‚Äôll talk to you again soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight then, I‚Äôll get back to doing the exciting work of analysing soil samples.‚Äù

And with that he hung up.

My head wasn‚Äôt swimming as much now. Though, I still needed to bring everything up with my family now, with the possibility that my old family could come back.

I yawned getting up from the sofa, the kitten cradled in my arms, I still had no idea how they would react to the news or how Edward and Emelia would react thinking I moved on from them.

I still needed to plan ahead, but If Unipher is able say if they are coming back or not is a load off my mind. Though I still need to talk to the kids and Ashia about Edward and Emilia, that if they do come back that I‚Äôm not going to up leave them, I wanted to know who Edward became and maybe get closure with Emilia, with me moving on, but what if they haven‚Äôt moved on from me?

1odhqsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheYardPodcast/comments/1odhqsz/fighting_diet_soda_misinformation_on_the_yard/,Fighting Diet Soda misinformation on the Yard Premium,"First, Northern Lion is wrong. The study did not find that diet soda consumption *causes* cognitive decline. Instead, they found a **tiny** association between a **vague** measure of non-calorie sweeteners, and cognitive decline, such that. In fact, they hid their measure of low-calorie sweetener consumption in another study, possibly because it is bullshit (citation 20 in the paper).

""Regular consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) was considered when participants used at least one NNS-sweetened product (such as soda, coffee, natural fruit juice, processed fruit juice, artificial juice, or yerba mate tea) at least once a day ... In the case of sodas, although the question does not differentiate between diet and light versions, both versions contain non-nutritive sweeteners in their composition"" - [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/22/4785](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/22/4785)

So, they estimated mg of non-calorie sweeteners with a general measure of tea, coffee, juice, and soda consumption, that ***DOES NOT EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NORMAL SODA AND DIET SODA!!!!*** 

Okay, so the measure is bullshit, right? but, let's say that the consumption of artificial sweeteners is associated with cognitive decline, what could be an explanation of that. How about, people with diabetes consume more artificial sweeteners and diabetes causes cognitive decline. That adds up to me, and aligns with past research, and the authors even acknowledged this in their paper:

""...although we adjusted the regression models for several clinical and lifestyle variables, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding, particularly because health behaviors may co-occur and some groups may consume more LCNSs because of their lifestyle and clinical history...""

Here is the link to the study in question, btw: [https://www.neurology.org/doi/full/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023](https://www.neurology.org/doi/full/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023)

Nick's Fallacy: Nick states that because diet soda tastes relatively good, it must be bad for you in some way. This is not a logical statement. There is no evidence of a balancing order in the universe that pleasurable things must have negative health consequences.

Finally, diet soda is basically a miracle, and I will not tolerate its slander. So many people die and are disabled each year from dietary factors, including high sugar consumption. Replacing full sugar sodas with diet sodas can literally save lives. Is diet soda inert? No, all substances are poisons with the appropriate dose. Relative to other, full-sugar beverage options, diet sodas are a great choice based on the current research.",106,1761160796.0,TheYardPodcast,11,0.98,False

21 F I am in college in the U.S. this is going on right now and I‚Äôm so confused. I have this friend I‚Äôll call Mary who I‚Äôve been close with since I was a freshman. We lived in the same dorm together. I became friends with Joey last year because we did a group project together and starting hanging out because of it. 

Mary and Joey met through me and have known each other for like 10 months. Mary is not the type to go hookup with people at bars and parties or have casual sex. She will drink and have fun but that‚Äôs never been her thing. Joey is super fun and cool. He‚Äôs also similar to Mary in that he doesn‚Äôt seem to go around chasing girls. 

Saturday, I was with Mary and another friend we both know and happened to run into Joey and some people I know through him at a bar. Idrk what came over the two of them but Mary and Joey were flirting all night and even kissed a few times at the bar. Joey told me a few times when Mary wasn‚Äôt around that he likes her. They were both tipsy (we all were) but when the night ended Mary started off with Joey to his apartment. I told her to text me when if she needs anything and I wanna know when she gets home. She was happy and it was all good. She texted me that night and said she got home around 3 am. She did not sleep at his place just went there. 

Mary asked me to meet her for a coffee yesterday afternoon. This is when she dumped everything on me. She said she realized that Saturday night she was into Joey, but still doesn‚Äôt think it was like her at all to go and have sex with him. She said she felt really bad and stupid and slutty for doing it. She then started saying that she was drunk and maybe Joey should have known that and not flirted with her. I told her it looked like Joey and her were having a great time. She said they did, but she was drunk. And Joey has asked her to hangout again but she hasn‚Äôt responded. She is afraid to see him again. 

She is telling me now that she is thinking of going to the a victim advocacy group or a counselor or even campus security and saying that Joey sexually assaulted her. She says that she consented while drunk, but she was drunk and that isn‚Äôt proper consent. I told her full stop and I think that‚Äôs going way too far. Joey is a nice guy, they got drunk and hooked up like so many people have. Joey is on an academic scholarship, this kind of thing would ruin that for him, possibly get him kicked out of school, and in legal trouble. I am trying very hard to get her to drop this. I even said I‚Äôd talk to Joey and do whatever I can to smooth this over. 

I don‚Äôt stand for SA and am always considering myself an ally to victims but I really can‚Äôt help but think Mary is just freaking out right now and not thinking straight. I don‚Äôt want her to ruin so much for Joey because of this. ",1,1761160686.0,AITAH,15,0.67,False

If you're serious about creating video content that *actually* converts, drives sales, and builds a brand...

And you're tired of ""AI tools"" that are basically just slot machines...

Then stop reading this post and go see the tool that's built for professionals, not hobbyists.

[**Click Here to See ClipsField AI in Action (And Stop Wasting Your Time).**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/ClipsFieldAI)

For the rest of you, let's talk about why your current AI tools are failing you.

# What Is ClipsField AI? (And Why It Matters to You)

""What is **ClipsField AI**?""

It's not *just* another ""prompt-to-video"" generator. Let's be frank: those are gambles. You type in a prayer, waste 5 credits, and get back some distorted, unusable, frankly *weird* junk. You can't build a business, launch an agency, or run a high-converting ad campaign on a *gamble*.

**ClipsField AI** is the answer to that problem.

It‚Äôs an advanced, AI-powered video and image creation *suite* designed for people who are actually trying to run a business, not just make pretty art.

It‚Äôs built around a structured, multi-step *workflow* that gives you total creative control. The result? Predictable, high-quality, viral-ready visual content. Every. Single. Time.

# The ""End of AI Guesswork"" Workflow

The core problem with most AI tools is that you have no control. You're a passenger. You type, you pray, you get what you get.

**ClipsField AI** is built on a different philosophy: **You are the director. The AI is your crew.**

It's not one tool; it's a full-stack production studio. Here are the core components:

# 1. The AI Video Generator (Clips Studio)

This is where your static, dead-in-the-water images become cinematic sales machines. This isn't about random motion. It's about *predictable* results.

* **Template-Driven Start:** You start with hundreds of professionally designed templates for different niches and styles. No more ""blank canvas"" paralysis.
* **Predictable Results:** You upload an image. The AI suggests up to 5 different viral video concepts *for* that image. You get to see a storyboard or hero image *before* you generate. This eliminates guesswork and stops you from wasting credits.
* **Director Mode:** Once you pick a concept, you fine-tune it. You control the camera motion (zooms, pans, dolly shots), the lighting (cinematic, dramatic), and the visual style (3D, classic). You are in charge.

# 2. The ClipsField Agentic AI Edition (The ""Photoshop Killer"")

This is the ""holy grail"" part. This is an advanced upsell that functions as a conversational, chat-based image editor. Forget layers. Forget complicated tools.

* **Multi-Image Editing:** You can upload multiple images into a single ""Magic Session.""
* **Conversational Commands:** You *talk* to the AI.
   * ""Change the color of this dress to red.""
   * ""Put a cowboy hat on this person.""
   * ""Combine the man from image 1 with the background of image 2.""
* **Iterative Creation:** Each result becomes the new starting point. You can layer commands to create highly detailed, custom, and frankly *impossible* visuals that no one else has.

# 3. The ClipsField AI Producer (The ""Video Synthesizer"")

Short, 5-second clips are great for getting attention. But sales happen in the *story*.

The Producer is a powerful, cloud-based video editor that lets you assemble your generated clips into a final, polished video.

* **Multi-Track Timeline:** Arrange your video clips, audio, music, and voiceovers.
* **Full Customization:** Add text overlays, your logo, and transitions.
* **Cloud Rendering:** Renders your final video on powerful servers, not your computer. It's fast, and it doesn't matter if you're working on a 10-year-old laptop.
* **Multiple Aspect Ratios:** Instantly format your final video for YouTube (16:9), TikTok/Reels (9:16), or Instagram (1:1).

You seeing this? **ClipsField AI** isn't a toy you play with. It's an end-to-end production workflow you build a business on.

# 10 ""Angles"" to Build a Business with ClipsField AI (The ""Blueprint"")

""Okay, I get the tool. How do I make money?""

Here are 10 angles you can run with *today*. Steal these.

1. **The ""Static to Sales"" Angle ‚Äì Your Product Photos Are Costing You Money**
   * **Problem:** Your still product images are invisible in 2025's motion-first feeds. You're losing clicks and sales to competitors with dynamic video ads.
   * **Solution:** **ClipsField AI** turns your static, boring product shots into scroll-stopping, cinematic video ads in under 60 seconds. Showcase your products with professional motion that grabs attention and converts.
2. **The ""Viral Ad Agency"" in a Box Angle ‚Äì The Ultimate ""Done-For-You"" Business**
   * **Problem:** Businesses are *desperate* for high-impact video ads but have no time or skill.
   * **Solution:** Use **ClipsField AI** to launch your own ""Viral Video Agency."" Create stunning ads for local businesses, e-commerce stores, and influencers. Charge $500+ for work that the AI does for you in minutes.
3. **The ""Director's Chair"" Angle ‚Äì Stop Gambling, Start Directing**
   * **Problem:** Most AI tools are a frustrating guessing game. You type, pray, and waste credits on random junk.
   * **Solution:** **ClipsField AI** puts you in the director's chair. Preview 5 different concepts, fine-tune the camera motion, and get the exact video you envisioned. Every time.
4. **The ""Endless Content"" Angle ‚Äì Never Run Out of High-Impact Video Again**
   * **Problem:** Creating daily video content for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts is exhausting.
   * **Solution:** With **ClipsField AI**, one image can become a dozen different video clips. Test different hooks and styles in minutes. Fill your entire month's social media calendar in a single afternoon.
5. **The ""Custom Creator"" Angle (for Agentic AI) ‚Äì Go Beyond Templates**
   * **Problem:** Your brand is unique, but every AI tool spits out the same generic-looking content.
   * **Solution:** Unlock the Agentic AI assistant. This chat-based editor lets you create completely custom visuals. Combine photos, change outfits, swap backgrounds. Create one-of-a-kind visuals that no one can replicate.
6. **The ""Storyteller"" Angle (for the Producer) ‚Äì From 5-Second Clips to 5-Minute Stories**
   * **Problem:** Short viral clips get attention, but they don't sell a complex offer.
   * **Solution:** Use the built-in Video Synthesizer to stitch your **ClipsField AI** clips together. Add music and voiceovers to create longer, story-driven videos for YouTube, compelling VSLs, or detailed product demos.
7. **The ""Ad Spend Saver"" Angle ‚Äì A/B Test Your Ads for Almost Free**
   * **Problem:** Testing different video ad creatives is incredibly expensive and slow.
   * **Solution:** With **ClipsField AI**, you can create dozens of ad variations in minutes for a fraction of the cost. Test different hooks and visuals to find the winning combination that lowers your ad spend and skyrockets your ROI.
8. **The ""Faceless Influencer"" Angle ‚Äì Build a Brand Without Showing Your Face**
   * **Problem:** You want to build a following and make money as a creator, but you don't want to be on camera.
   * **Solution:** **ClipsField AI** is the ultimate tool for faceless creators. Turn any image, idea, or piece of content into professional-looking videos that build authority, all while protecting your privacy.
9. **The ""Brand Consistency"" Angle ‚Äì Professionalism on Autopilot**
   * **Problem:** Your social media feed looks disjointed and unprofessional.
   * **Solution:** **ClipsField AI** lets you set your brand's style, upload your logo, and choose your aesthetic once. Every video you create looks polished, cohesive, and instantly recognizable.
10. **The ""First Mover"" Angle ‚Äì Dominate Niches with a New Content Style**
   * **Problem:** Everyone is using the same AI tools, and feeds are flooded with repetitive, low-effort AI content.
   * **Solution:** Get ahead of the curve. **ClipsField AI**'s unique cinematic style and predictable workflow allow you to produce a *higher quality* of video content that stands out.

# 10 ""Out of the Box"" Viral Hooks to Steal

Need inspiration? Stop making boring ads. Make *content*. Here are 10 viral concepts you can create with the Agentic AI to stop the scroll and build an audience.

1. **The ""Product Time Machine"":** Take a vintage product (like an old Coke bottle). Use chat commands to ""make it look 80s,"" then ""give it a sleek, futuristic 2025 look."" **Hook:** ""We Sent a Classic Nike Shoe Through a Time Machine... Using Only AI.""
2. **The ""Alternate Universe"" Brand Swap:** Take rivals like McDonald's and Burger King. Use chat commands to swap their branding. **Hook:** ""What If McDonald's Was Run by Burger King? We Asked an AI to Show Us.""
3. **The ""AI vs. Photoshop Speedrun"":** Split-screen video. A pro in Photoshop vs. you in **ClipsField AI** doing the same complex edit. You'll finish in 10 seconds. **Hook:** ""Pro Photoshop Artist vs. One Line of Text. Who Can Edit This Image Faster?""
4. **The ""Meme Evolution"" Engine:** Take the ""Distracted Boyfriend"" meme. Use the AI to ""put the characters in ancient Rome."" **Hook:** ""We Asked an AI to Reimagine Famous Memes. The Results Are Incredible.""
5. **The ""From Sketch to Cinematic"" Reveal:** Upload a terrible hand-drawn sketch. Use commands to ""turn this into a photorealistic person,"" then ""put them in a neon-lit city."" **Hook:** ""I Can't Draw. So I Asked an AI to Turn My Terrible Sketch Into a Movie Scene.""
6. **The ""Fix My Terrible Photo"" Challenge:** Take a blurry, badly-lit photo. Use the AI to ""make this sharper,"" ""improve the lighting,"" and ""remove the clutter."" **Hook:** ""Can AI Save This Awful Photo? We Put It to the Test.""
7. **The ""AI Dream Vacation"" Creator:** Upload a selfie. Use commands to ""put me on top of Mount Everest,"" then ""on a beach in the Maldives."" **Hook:** ""I Traveled the World in 60 Seconds Without Leaving My Desk. Here's How.""
8. **The ""If Animals Were Business Professionals"" Series:** Take a stock photo of a lion. Use the AI to ""put a business suit and tie on this lion."" **Hook:** ""We Asked AI to Show Us What Animals Would Look Like if They Had Office Jobs.""
9. **The ""Make My Product Famous"" Mashup:** Take your e-commerce product. Use the AI to ""place this coffee mug on the table in the 'Pulp Fiction' diner scene."" **Hook:** ""My Product Isn't Famous. So I Used AI to Put It in the Movies.""
10. **The ""Interactive Story"" Poll:** Post an image. Ask your audience: ""Should we put him on a spaceship or in a jungle?"" Use **ClipsField AI** to create the winning scene. **Hook:** ""You Control the Story. We'll Use AI to Bring It to Life. What Happens Next?""

# The Bottom Line: Stop Gambling. Start Directing.

Look, in 2025, attention is currency. And ""hope"" is not a business strategy.

You can either keep gambling with AI ""toys"" that spit out random, unusable junk, wasting your time, your money, and your ad budget...

Or you can use a professional-grade *workflow* that gives you predictable results, complete creative control, and a clear path to profit.

**ClipsField AI** is that workflow.

Stop playing. Start producing.

*Where Football Meets Farce, and the Broncos Reign Supreme*

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You‚Äôll Actually Enjoy**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers because, let‚Äôs face it, Boise State‚Äôs odds of **-1786** on the moneyline aren‚Äôt just steep‚Äîthey‚Äôre a vertical cliff. That‚Äôs an implied probability of **94.7%**, which means bookmakers think Nevada‚Äôs chances of winning are about as likely as me understanding quantum physics after one cup of coffee. The spread is **Boise -21.5**, a line so lopsided it‚Äôs basically saying, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs just give Nevada a touchdown to make it fun.‚Äù

The total is **51 points**, with the over priced at **-110** across most books. Why? Because Boise State averages **36.9 PPG** (20th in FBS), and Nevada allows **23.7 PPG** (64th in FBS). Add those numbers, and you get **60.6 points**‚Äîa number that makes the ‚Äúover‚Äù look like a sure thing. It‚Äôs like betting that a popcorn machine will pop kernels in a quiet room.

**News Digest: Injuries, or Why Nevada Should Pack a Towel**  
The Wolf Pack‚Äôs ‚Äúnews‚Äù is about as exciting as a spreadsheet error. No star players are injured‚Äîyet‚Äîbut their 1-6 record and 0-3 Mountain West start suggest their offense is a leaky faucet and their defense is a sieve made of Jell-O. Meanwhile, Boise State‚Äôs **Sire Gaines** (1,200+ rushing yards this season) is healthy, and their offense is a well-oiled popcorn popper: 36.9 PPG with a 12th-ranked total YPG. Nevada‚Äôs only hope is a time machine to 2015, when they briefly believed they could compete with everyone.

1odhk7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1odhk7a/gaggiuino_or_gaggiamate_another_thread/,Gaggiuino or Gaggiamate - another thread,"Folks, I am more interested in geeking out than the taste of coffee, as I have still not learned the taste of good coffee yet. I only know sour and bitter, as I still have not tasted notes of oranges and such in my coffee. I am very excited to get there.

Just got my new Gaggia Classic Pro E24 and I am interested in the Gaggiamate or Gaggiuino mod. I am creating the thread again to learn from users with the latest updates to both mods. If you have experience with one or both then please chime in.

My decision criteria is roughly in this order: Features, Software maturity, Quality of parts, Hardware extensibility, Community support.

1. Gaggiamate pro 1.61 build and Gaggiuino Gen 3 V4 kit have similar features: pressure control, flow control, shot by time and weight, BT scale integration, steam enhancements, headless web interface, LCD etc. Hardware scale and tank LED is coming soon in Gaggiamate. The scale is not important for me as I have Bookoo, and I believe the hardware scales are a hassle in removing the tank. I believe that hardware scales are sensitive, and weight will vary over time with heat and such scales go bad quickly. Adding LED and water level sensor will be an easy add to Gaggiamate in future (15 mins tops, < less than $50). Do you know any other features missing from Gaggiamate? Any other suggestions?
2. Which system has better maturity of algorithms at present? If Gaggiamate is behind, then does it need months to catch up after learnings from significant feedback and adoption and user community? Please share if you have any experience. The fear that I have is to run into bugs or boundary conditions where I get frustrated debugging and stop drinking coffee and start drinking whiskey again.
3. Vendors: Gaggiuino Peak coffee vendor's premium kit with included scale and LED is up to 460 dollars shipped to US + another \~50 dollars for 3d printed housings will make the whole kit greater than 500 dollars. The DIY-EFI Gaggiuino kit with ToFnLED ($318 + \~50 for housings) does not look as good to me. The pressure sensor in pictures is not stainless steel and does not have HV cables and resettable thermo fuse. Peak advertises Gold plated, unleaded SMT, includes HV cables, Food grade stainless steel pressure sensor, and resettable thermo fuse which may come handy some day. Gaggiamate is a standard build, does not include ToFnLED, scale, or resettable thermo fuse, and comes with housing. Parts look decent quality and the cost is $270. Both kits do not appear to have any wait time anymore and will be shipped same week. I am looking at a $200 dollar difference in the Peak Gaggiuino and Gaggiamate Pro kits with ToFnLED. I will suck it up if users have seen a significant benefit.
4. I find Gaggiuino documentation much more evolved and easy to understand than Gaggiamate, which includes tools, step-by-step good diagrams, options, and many other good descriptions and elaborations. I am new to installation but not afraid of it; I may need a responsive community to help. The Gaggiamate discord community is a breath of fresh air; Gaggiuino is more disciplined and restrictive and one feels pushed back to be careful with the questions.
5. Open source or no, it is not much of a concern for me as I am unlikely to tinker with the software or add additional hardware. I have some urge to integrate the shot metrics with as much data that I can with AI in future. I guess I can do it with both machines by taking a dump of all shot metrics and feeding it to an LLM. I prefer to see the graphs on the machine live to get and learn from the feedback, but the round screen of Gaggiamate does not provide that. However, that is a very small factor as analyzing live graphs is very hard. Offline graphs are available on both.

Any other advice is appreciated. Cross posting in facebook Gaggia forum as well to get feedback and will share learnings for other users here. Thanks for your suggestions",6,1761160385.0,gaggiaclassic,4,1.0,False
1odhk40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImpulseLabs/comments/1odhk40/review_its_awesome_software_needs_to_alleviate/,Review: It's awesome. Software needs to alleviate boil-over form factor drawback.,"Personal bias statement:   
Two developer no kids household that previously owned KitchenAid and Bosch induction tops. We cook mostly steaks or chicken and veg with mediocre skill while distractedly doing something else.  Have appreciated similarly instrumented appliances (e.g., Decent Espresso machine) not for all the numbers necessarily, but for unexpected workflows they open up (e.g., pruning undesired flavors, more easily switching between different coffees in a day). If an appliance has a crap interface, we reverse whatever protocol and make our own app (e.g., Human Touch massage chair).

We've had the cooktop for almost a week, but plopped on rails rather than in a cabinet because we're awaiting a replacement top due to some markings. That means no fan noise muffling, but the ability to feel the undercarriage after heavy use (never very warm to the touch).

TLDR:   
\+ Extremely impressive build quality (let alone for a launch) and beautiful retro modern industrial design   
\+ 10 kW with temperature control is handy for walking away, getting stuff done with fewer back-and-forths to the kitchen  
\+ Smooth setup  
\+ Most nits may be software fixes  
\- Form factor is not ideal for safety (for a boil over, your hand must enter the splatter radius to yank the knob off); would be better as a spacious 2 burner  
\- Form factor is not ideal for cleaning oil splatter (lots of silicone crevices, but better than cleaning a gas stove, maybe helped by metal covers over unused burners)

If Impulse ever released a ‚â¶30"" 2 burner that affords more breathing room, I'd love to buy that one. 

\----  
Our unit is on firmware 1.1.56.

Power:  
\+ 10 kW is surprisingly handy  
\- Within 1 minute of usage a pot of water boiled over. If you do not watch it, it will boiler over sooner than you remember to think about it. Stopping a boil over requires yanking the knob, which is underneath raining 100\*C water. (Sadly, Impulse can't fix my stupid.)

Temperature mode:  
\+ Extremely handy to walk away for a few minutes knowing something will not burn or surpass a browning level (surprisingly useful workflow change, e.g., clarifying butter, adding thyme to the butter while resting a steak)  
\- Getting to target temp is too timid; so we run in power mode and then switch to target temp

Battery:  
\+ Marketing re: cooking on 110V or after a power outage is all true (we used \~15% to boil 4L and cook two steaks)  
\+ Wild this power is available on 110V  
\+ Battery is swappable after installation (if you have a front panel access to remove one screw)

Noise:  
\+ No induction on/off ticks, no buzzing in our pans and pots  
\+ Fan noise isn't bad

Form factor:  
\+ Temperature sensing nipple moves up and down to conform to pans with slight curvatures (e.g., one of our IKEA pans, many pans will arc a little after high input)  
\- Boil over requires reaching hand into blast radius to turn off the hob. Either (a) auto-shut off (b) allow assigning knob‚Äìhob relationships or (c) if in power mode, yanking any knob powers off all burners  
\- A 26 cm Le Cruset pan will touch another 26 cm if used in nearby hobs. Anything larger and the nearby hob becomes unusable and the pan can hover over its control knob. These hobs are simply too close together to truly be 4 burner. That said, we really only need 2, but would much prefer that 3rd and 4th burner be blank space to give more hand room between pans and the control knobs.  
\- Unlike most induction tops, this has lots of nooks and crannies that make wiping it down a bit of a faff. While the materials and design are of impeccable quality, I'd rather have flat (with temperature nipples).  
\~ Engineers have replied I'm wrong, but (stubborn me) given that airflow and cooling is excellent, I'd rather have the front louvers to be oriented downward to shed rather than capture any possible oil or water intrusion, even if unlikely. The front ones pull in cool air (expelled out the back), so I don't think pointing up really has any extreme advantage. Low hanging belt and suspenders.

Software:  
\+ Lots of updates already  
\++ Explicit change log  
\- Turning this on is annoying (Every time: long press tiny inconvenient power button for 2x my patience span; devs say an update is coming but the concept isn't going away \[possibly due to some unreasonable external authority\]. The knobs feel great, but sadly purposefully do nothing to wake the device.)  
\- Lots of empty screen when cooking, but lacks any timers / elapsed time indicator  
\- Needs an auto-install updates option with a delay (e.g., wait for 7 days before installing) to minimize risk of borking on an unexpectedly sour release  
\- No fast-boil-but-stop-on-boil-over mode (or at least it didn't engage when our pot of water boiled over)  
\- No ability to move a control knob to a safer spot (e.g., if boiling water or if a larger pan is close to it)  
\- No custom preset temperature labels  
\- No wifi thermometer integration (e.g., the Typhur in some of Impulse's demos)  
\- No MQTT broadcast / remote turn off / turn down (e.g., if I use temperature mode or have a video feed going while I step away). This is sorely needed, even without any promise of a stable API. A community of devs publishing open source utilities can turn this into a much more valuable platform, similar to what happened with Decent Espresso.  
\- Needs a way to toggle units while cooking (sometimes contend with Fahrenheit recipes)  
\- Menus via knob twists are a little laggy

I'd expect most of that software stuff is prioritized appropriately sprint queues already, given the activity log and the attention to detail already apparent in this product. ",5,1761160379.0,ImpulseLabs,4,1.0,False

**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Soap Opera**  
Virginia Tech enters as a 4.5-point favorite (-198 moneyline) against California, but their r√©sum√© is as shaky as a quarterback‚Äôs grip on a wet football. The Hokies have covered the spread just once in seven games and are a dismal 0-3 when favored by 4.5 points or more. Meanwhile, Cal‚Äôs +164 underdog tag hides a team that‚Äôs averaged 52.2 points in their last three games‚Äî1.7 above the 50.5-point over/under.

Key numbers scream like a halftime band:

* **Virginia Tech‚Äôs passing offense (199.6 yards/game, 97th)** vs. Cal‚Äôs passing defense (201.6 yards allowed, 48th). It‚Äôs like watching a slow drip battle a leaky faucet‚Äîneither wins, but both get soggy.
* **Cal‚Äôs red zone efficiency (84.6%, 68th)** vs. Virginia Tech‚Äôs red zone defense (100.0%, 134th). The Hokies‚Äô defense is a sieve in the kitchen, and Cal‚Äôs offense is bringing a ladle.
* **Cal‚Äôs freshman QB Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele (8 INTs)** vs. Virginia Tech‚Äôs pass rush (ranked 10th in the ACC). This is a rookie‚Äôs first job interview: high stakes, zero confidence, and a 50% chance of spilling coffee on your shirt.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Inexperience, and a Dash of Drama**  
Virginia Tech‚Äôs defense, led by Kelvin Gilliam Jr. and Kemari Copeland, has been a rare bright spot, holding opposing QBs to season-lows. But their offense? A jalopy with a flat tire and a GPS set to ‚Äúnowhere fast.‚Äù Cal‚Äôs rushing attack is the ACC‚Äôs worst (94.3 yards/game), and their QB‚Äôs eight interceptions read like a ‚ÄúHow Not to Throw a Football‚Äù manual.

Meanwhile, Virginia Tech‚Äôs offense is a ghost town‚Äîaveraging 23.0 points/game (97th in FBS), while Cal‚Äôs defense allows 29.3. It‚Äôs a numbers game: The Hokies ne

GENRE: Stutter house, festival progressive house, melodic house

>German electronic artist BUNT. delivers party-friendly dance jams that honor the spirit of the late Avicii and channel the early material of funky forebears Justice, Basement Jaxx, and Calvin Harris. Originating as the duo of Levi Wijk and Nico Crispin, BUNT. debuted in the mid-2010s, expanding their folk-house sound by incorporating horns, banjos, and fiddles, and drawing from soul, pop, and Latin music. Popular songs like ""Unbreakable"" (featuring Clarence Coffee, Jr.) and ""Crocodile Tears"" (with Jens Hult) helped establish them internationally, and after Crispin's departure in 2021, Wijk vaulted BUNT. to even greater success, signing to Arista Records and releasing the 2023 hit ""Clouds"" featuring Nate Traveller, and the Renaissance EP. In 2024, he paired with Mapei for ""Trippin'"" and released the album Levi Don't Do It.

1odhf3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1odhf3k/jean_saint_jean_part_iiiiv_health_food_kills/,Jean Saint Jean Part III/IV:  Health Food Kills,"The woman screeched as the snake lunged at her face.¬†¬†In the blink of an eye the snake was airborne and then writhing on the ground, cut in half.¬†¬†She backed into a tree and breathed shakily.

I wiped my snow ax on my sleeveless parka, my snow-pants likewise cut down to shorts.¬†¬†I stamped down on the snake‚Äôs head.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing off the path?‚Äù¬†¬†I asked, not looking at the terrified woman, but scanning the foliage.¬†¬†Trout Mountain Shop had one zone that was the most dangerous of thema ll.¬†¬†You couldn‚Äôt freeze to death in it, that‚Äôs true.¬†¬†No avalanches or Elk mauling‚Äôs would ever be reported here.

But Health Food Kills.

‚ÄúI... Oh my god. . . I just wanted to save on my supplements.¬†¬†I heard there was a clearance aisle this way.‚Äù¬†¬†She replied, her voice coming in an out between silent pauses as she stared at the snake.

‚ÄúYeah, there is.¬†¬†But is it worth your life?‚Äù¬†¬†I asked, sheathing the ice ax in my belt and finally giving her a look.¬†¬†

She was wearing a crop-top which featured sunflowers spilling across her chest.¬†¬†She was better dressed for the jungle than I was, short shorts which started and ended at her beltline and hiking boots.¬†¬†The boots were a nice touch.

‚ÄúCan you lead the way?‚Äù¬†¬†She asked, stepping form the tree and walking in a wide arch around the snake corpse.¬†¬†Bits of the snake sparked as the electronics inside slowly died down.

‚ÄúI can, but I‚Äôm heading deeper in, I‚Äôm not going back to the safety of the aisles.¬†¬†My journey takes me there.‚Äù¬†¬†I pointed at the tip of a stone pyramid in the distance.¬†¬†‚ÄúThair‚Äôs someone waiting for me there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can find my own way back, just take me to clearance, please.‚Äù¬†¬†She reached forward and put a hand on my chest.¬†¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good man for saving me.‚Äù

I looked down at her hand and then back at her face.¬†¬†‚ÄúThe savings aren‚Äôt even that good.¬†¬†Everything is super expired.¬†¬†The only reason they want people trying to find it is to harvest their organs after the snakes drag you into the pits.‚Äù

She shook her head.¬†¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really after savings.¬†¬†I‚Äôm. . . Looking for someone.‚Äù

I nodded.¬†¬†‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôm looking for someone too.¬†¬†You can follow me, but if a snake injects you, I‚Äôll do what I can, but I can‚Äôt abandon my mission.¬†¬†You have no idea how difficult this has been.‚Äù¬†¬†I shrugged my backpack off and took from inside the machete I had pilfered from Hudnut‚Äôs corpse.¬†¬†

‚ÄúStep only where I step.‚Äù¬†¬†I said and then we started off.¬†¬†The machete cut through the thick green foliage with ease, it was after all a Trout Eterna-Blade.¬†¬†They supposedly never needed sharpening.¬†¬†I have to admit it made the trek through the thick jungle growth much easier.

For her part the woman kept to my footsteps and tried not to distract me.¬†¬†The jungle was very dangerous.¬†¬†Health Goods had not always been this way, once upon a time it was a normal eco-zone, if not more humid than most.¬†¬†But during the Covid Shutdown the employees had gone ‚Äúback to the old ways‚Äù.¬†¬†

No one knew quite what that meant until the manager of the eco-zone arrived in the techno-retro electronics section with his hands tied behind him with vines.¬†¬†According to him they had started sacrificing management to the Ceiling God above.¬†¬†If they captured enough human hearts the Great Fluorescence would fill them with holy light and blah-blah-blah.¬†¬†The man was clearly nuts.

Then the customers started disappearing.¬†¬†At first everyone thought he had been right.¬†¬†Then we saw the new offerings in the Discount Medical Bay right up front beside the Danada‚Äôs Coffee place.¬†¬†Human organs for sale.¬†¬†At a bargain.

It all clicked.¬†¬†The employees were just playing into a stereotypical role of the jungle tribe to cover up their nefarious plots of organ theft.¬†¬†Trout Mountain Shop for their part just rolled with it, probably making a dime in the process.¬†¬†All the other employees received instructions on how to avoid being ‚Äúharvested‚Äù and that was that.¬†¬†

Danao‚Äôs Coffee is excellent by the way.¬†¬†Just saying.

I cut through a vine hanging looped down in our path and froze.¬†¬†The spider slowly unfolded from its perch.¬†¬†A Venezuelan Leaping Violet.¬†¬†It chittered and did its namesake.¬†¬†This time my cut was off, the machete cutting through thin air as the spider landed deftly on my face.¬†¬†I fell back, but before it could bite the woman jumped forward and kicked.¬†¬†The spider shot off my face with the force of a canon, slamming into a tree and bursting into semi-organic mush.¬†¬†

She reached down as I lay panting, one hand splayed over my face feeling for any bite marks.¬†¬†A bite would probably paralyze me until some Health Food Hunters came along to collect the days bounty.¬†¬†I rook her hand after another beat of time, and she grunted as she hefted me up.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNice kick.‚Äù¬†¬†I said, still breathing fast.

‚ÄúThanks, I used to play kick ball.‚Äù¬†¬†She replied.

‚ÄúNot soccer?‚Äù¬†¬†I said, looking at her.¬†¬†I had never heard of an adult playing kick ball.

‚ÄúNo, kick ball.¬†¬†I was a professional kick ball player in a previous life.¬†¬†Back in Portland.‚Äù¬†¬†

I finally understood.¬†¬†A Portlander.¬†¬†‚ÄúThat makes sense.¬†¬†We should be at the clearance section any minute now.¬†¬†But watch out.¬†¬†One Leaping Violet usually means more.‚Äù

As if on cue the woman stumbled as something massive, orblike, and purple struck her on the shoulder.¬†¬†Its legs intertwined with her hair as I shot the machete forward and cut it in two.¬†¬†Not before its fangs sank down into the flesh of her neck.¬†¬†

A silent scream was frozen on her face as I watched her muscles go limp and she started to fall.¬†¬†I caught her and held her limp Ody with one arm as my machete was at the ready in my other hand.¬†¬†I scanned the jungle for anymore.

After a minute of nothing happening I hefted her onto my shoulder and turned back to continue on the path.¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt know what to do to keep her safe, I couldn‚Äôt abandon her at the clearance section, but I also couldn‚Äôt abandon my mission.¬†¬†Koba was waiting for me at the Stone Teeple, I know it.¬†¬†

The clearance section was closer than I expected.¬†¬†Apparently, the Leaping Violets liked to use it as a honeypot to attract and subdue victims.¬†¬†I checked the random hodge-podge of useless crap they usually stocked this area with.¬†¬†I found a lantern that was missing its battery bay door but still functioned with kerosene and a package of ‚ÄúGlue-Shoots‚Äù.¬†¬†These were from some long forgotten Fourth of July celebration sale and were essentially grenades which exploded with glitter-glue.¬†¬†A horrible idea.

A really fucking horrible idea.¬†¬†People died.¬†¬†Lots of people.

But now I had grenades.¬†¬†Badass.

As I plundered the store shelves, I had laid the woman down in-between two of the aisles.¬†¬†I was busy attaching Glue-Shoots to my belt as I heard it.¬†¬†A soft tut-tut-tut of someone‚Äôs tongue clacking rhythmically.¬†¬†My hairs stood on end.¬†¬†

I made my way back, as quite as I could be, drawing both my machete and my ice ax.¬†¬†That was a Hunters call, the all-clear one if I remember correctly.¬†¬†The Hunters had gone off the deep end.¬†¬†But they hadn‚Äôt seen me yet, which is probably why I was still alive.

These people had jobs like everyone else.¬†¬†They had families, mortgages, a dog, a crippling addiction to pornography, all the usual taglines of an employee of Trout Mountain Shop.¬†¬†They had one more thing though.¬†¬†A literal, honest to gods, license to kill.¬†¬†It was issued by the General Manager of the store and was legal only in Trout Mountain Health old sections.¬†¬†I don‚Äôt think it would stand up in a court of law, but then again when is the last time you saw a cop making sure no one dies in the Target toy aisle?

I‚Äôve never seen the police in the store, not once.¬†¬†

I used the mirror finish of the ice ax to check around the corner of the aisle and saw not one but two standing over the unconscious woman.¬†¬†One had a spear about eight feet long, tapered to a wicked point, and the other had a bow held loose in two hands, arrow at the ready but the bow did not pull all the way back.¬†¬†The second one also had a quiver of thin but deadly arrows at his hip.¬†¬†

Both were Caucasian, which made their loincloths and bare skin stand out all the more.¬†¬†I‚Äôd have called it cultural appropriation if they hadn‚Äôt lived like this for years upon years at this point.¬†¬†It was less assimilation and more a shared delusion that they truly were the tribe of this jungle, and we were trespassers who must be put into the harvesting pits.

I guess I haven‚Äôt overed those.¬†¬†Every quarter mile or so there was a pit, approximately eight feet by four feet, in the ground.¬†¬†It was about four feet deep, and when a body was set into one of these pits it would enclose them, and they would drop into the underbelly of Health Foods where the bodies were harvested by med techs.¬†¬†This was all standard operating procure for most Trout Mountain Shop ovations.

I steeled myself.¬†¬†Then I cut around the corner and sprinted.¬†¬†The one with the spear noticed me first and turned, his spear lowering.¬†¬†Its length was a disadvantage as I used my ax to push it out of the way and then cut with the machete, snapping it in twain.¬†¬†

That‚Äôs when the arrow grazed my stomach muscles, burning a hot line of fire along my ribs.¬†¬†I kicked out, catching the archer in the knee and making him crumple as the spearman backpedaled and fell over the woman‚Äôs still body.¬†¬†He went down hard, and I heard him gasping for breath as the air was knocked out of him.¬†¬†

The archer got up on one knee and then a piercing whistle sounded from him.¬†¬†He was calling others.¬†¬†I have killed before, mostly in self-defense in Trout Mountain.¬†¬†Once for a promotion, Ut that‚Äôs a story for a different time.¬†¬†This was cold-blooded.

My ax took him in the face at nose level.¬†¬†The blade bit deep and it carved a massive channel which tore through his visage.¬†¬†Teeth flew and one of his eyes was ejected from his skull as he was whipped sideways by the furious blow.

I turned to the other man, snarling.¬†¬†He screamed and rolled sideways, leaving behind his broken spear.¬†¬†He ran for the jungles edge with me hot ion his heels until arrows came pouring out of the foliage.¬†¬†Whether by accident, or more likely to punish his cowardice, an arrow thanked into his skull.¬†¬†The body kepi running for another minute, veering wildly and shutting down slowly.¬†

For my part I threw myself to the side, into an aisle which rocked as the arrows impacted it.¬†¬†I looked back at the woman‚Äôs body and then used my ax trick to try and see the employees in the tree line.¬†¬†No sooner did I stick it out than an arow pinged off it, nearly wrenching it from my hands.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù¬†¬†I said to the woman‚Äôs body and then I took off down the aisle.¬†¬†At the far end I threw a container of protein powder back the way I came and then I sprinted the moment the arrows started hailing down onto the barrel.

I made it to the tree line with no issue.¬†¬†I checked myself and realized I had an arrow sticking into my backpack, which I pulled out before starting to venture on.¬†¬†I only glanced back once to see the little clearance sections warming with Health Food employees.¬†¬†She was destined to be harvested now.

I trudged through the jungle, to able to shake the disappointment.¬†¬†I was disappointed in myself.¬†¬†Sure, I couldn‚Äôt have done anything against those numbers, but I had promised to assist a customer in finding the clearance section safely.¬†¬†I had failed.¬†¬†

I was so lost in thought I almost tumbled into the Harvesting Pit that seemed to dissolve into being out of the jungle.¬†¬†I looked at it for a moment and made up my mind.¬†¬†No one would be expecting this.¬†¬†It also made perfect sense.

Koba was waiting for me to walk up those stone stairs of the pyramid.¬†¬†Instead, what if I walked in through the back door?¬†¬†Or more accurately the employee entrance?¬†¬†I jumped into the little pit, mind made up.¬†¬†I could save the woman and surprise Koba, the fox woman, the one who shat upon a plate all those years ago.¬†¬†

I laid down in the pit and waited.¬†¬†Nothing happened.¬†¬†Then somewhere beneath me a motor gently geared up.¬†¬†The dirt to either side of the pit fell away as the top slid closed.¬†¬†After I was entombed, I felt the box I was in jolt and drop a distance.¬†¬†Then I was turned right-side up, my feet clunking as I slid down.¬†¬†I imagined in my minds eye steer corpses hung in a slaughterhouse.

Only this would be a maze of hung caskets, each one eight feet long by four feet wide and deep.¬†¬†Being moved through some kind of conveyor belt system.¬†¬†It was completely dark in the box, but I wedged my ax blade into a seam where the edges met and worked it back and forth.¬†¬†

After some elbow grease the lid popped off, clanging onto the floor.¬†¬†I doubt anyone heard it as the roar of the machines burst into the space.¬†¬†The room was exactly what I had pictured, almost fictionally so.¬†¬†Large gray boxes made their way along a conveyor system, with employees waiting at the far end with various implements of doom.¬†¬†

I watched as one box was opened and a Leaping Violet came out, latching onto the face of a med tech and sending the man backwards and down, biting all the while.¬†¬†I couldn‚Äôt hear the screams.¬†¬†Only the mechanical white noise of the many machines that were all working at once.¬†¬†The employee shad heavy duty hearing protection on, big black headphone looking things which blocked the noise.¬†¬†

I saw a rack of them along the wall, and I jumped down out of my box and put one on.¬†¬†It came to life and the machine noise died away to a dull buzz in the background.¬†¬†I started hearing voices.

‚ÄúBravo this is Echo, another target subdued.¬†¬†How goes the hunt for Pink October?¬†¬†Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúEcho, this is Bravo, negative on Pink October, slipped the net.¬†¬†Returning to regular search and retrieval patten.¬†¬†Delivering Team Charlie corpses for Harvesting.¬†¬†Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus-God-Fuck it won‚Äôt stop biting.¬†¬†Oh God!¬†¬†Oh GOD!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Echo, stay off the fucking radio your organ grinders, or I will personally come down there and fulfill my daily quota with your kidneys.‚Äù

I heard all this, and at the last section I saw another employee on the line turn to the downed man and pull off his headset as he screamed inaudibly.¬†¬†I narrowed my eyes and past these two was a familiar sight, a pair of hiking boots on a table, theoretically still worn by the woman.

I leaped up onto one of the tables and ran along it, slipping and sliding on the gore which was left willy nilly as the man was being attacked by the spider.¬†¬†I spared a moment to hack down at a med tech as I passed and then jumped from one table to another.¬†¬†

A man came at me with a whirring bone-saw, and I deflected it with my ax as my machete bit into his lower leg.¬†¬†I tanked it free and got a satisfying scream over the radio before I stomped down on his head, cutting it off.

‚ÄúTheres someone down here!¬†¬†Wearing pink!‚Äù¬†¬†I heard over my headset as I turned back to the woman and saw that her shirt had been cut away and two med techs were preparing to open her up.¬†¬†

I leaped from my table to theirs, careful to land legs apart over the woman‚Äôs body.¬†¬†I kicked out at one med tech, catching him squarely in the face, but the other sliced at me with a scalpel she was preparing to incise into the defenseless woman.¬†

It cut into my boot, slicing through the leather, and I felt a white-hot burning.¬†¬†It must not have bit deep though as my leg didn‚Äôt crumple with cut muscles and I was able to deftly bring my ax down into the dome of her skull.¬†¬†

I panted a moment.¬†¬†Then the med tech on the ground moved, he was starting to get to his feet.¬†¬†I landed on top of his chest with both feet, feeling the snapping of bones.¬†¬†Then I lashed down with the machete twice, ending it.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt feel guilty.¬†¬†These people lived by the blade and died by the baled.¬†¬†It wasn‚Äôt as if I were carving through the Sherpas of Big Elk-Land.¬†¬†These people were literally running an illegal black market organ harvesting ring underneath the Health Foods section of Trout Mountain.¬†¬†I mean, on the scale of what Trout Mountain has done, on the sheer quantities of atrocities released by this global conglomerate onto the Earth, it was small potatoes.¬†¬†But still.

I turned to the woman and instantly looked away, her bareness making me blush.¬†¬†I hadn‚Äôt thought of anything but revenge in so long that my first instinct was to leave the woman be.¬†¬†But she wasn‚Äôt safe here.¬†¬†Probably wouldn‚Äôt be safe again now that they had her in the system.¬†¬†She was marked for harvesting, one way or the other.¬†¬†

I reached down and removed the female med techs lab coat, then I spread this over the woman and lifted her onto my shoulder, fireman style.¬†¬†

‚ÄúEcho this is Bravo, entering Employee Stairwell 2.¬†¬†Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger Bravo, this is Echo.¬†¬†Moving into Organ Grinder territory from the south now.¬†¬†Over.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if they realized I had a headset, and I didn‚Äôt stick around to find out.¬†¬†I ran as fast as I could through the maze-like corridors of the harvesting zone.¬†¬†Until I ran past a door which I had to double back too.¬†¬†It said simply¬†*Stone Mountain Entrance*.

I pushed through and found myself in a murky stone cavern.¬†¬†The door closed behind me, and I turned to it.¬†¬†The door was built into the roughhewn stone of the wall and had a handle and beside it a sign saying¬†*Harvest Laboratories*.¬†¬†I took one of the Glue Shoots from my belt a carefully wedged it between the handle and the wall.¬†¬†Then I carefully pulled out the pin, making sure the grenades handle didn‚Äôt open.¬†¬†

If they followed, they were in for a sticky surprise.

I turned back to the cavern and started walking along it.¬†¬†Lights were hidden in rocky outcroppings, so everything was lit with an eerie glow.¬†¬†I stopped as I approached a rail system built into the ground.¬†¬†A cart rolled down and stopped in front of me.¬†¬†A guard rail raised up with a. hiss.¬†¬†I looked around.¬†¬†My headset was still blocking noise, and I didn‚Äôt realize the radio function had stopped working.¬†

I pulled it off.¬†¬†

‚Äú-art.¬†¬†If you can hear me, put her in the cart.¬†¬†Then get in.¬†¬†It‚Äôs good to see you again.¬†¬†I look forward to our reunion.‚Äù¬†¬†

The cove from the speakers made my hair stand on end.¬†¬†It was Koba.¬†¬†The fox woman.¬†¬†The one I had been chasing now for months.¬†¬†I followed her here.¬†¬†Now it was almost done.

You arrive to the conference on time, plug your phone in and well the rest of the day is a success. 

On the way back you run into one of your neighbors and you chat, except when BART takes a corner at 120dB. 

When you arrive at your home station, you both decide to chat a bit more. So you walk over to the food area: 4 food and drink trucks with covered tent seating. You order some tacos and a brewskie while your friend gets Jamaican fare and a sparkling  water.  You chat over food and gp your seperate ways.

I don't want BART swag.

First one was coffee and walking around this park near downtown, super chill and we really clicked. Like the conversation was so easy and we were laughing the whole time.

Anyway she texted me after saying she had a great time and wants to plan the next date. She suggested this new restaurant that just opened and I looked it up and the entrees alone are like $45-60. Don't get me wrong I have a decent job but I've been trying to save money for a car down payment and I usually don't spend that much on dinners even for myself lol.

I really like her and want to see where this goes but I'm kinda stressed because I don't want her to think I'm cheap or not interested. At the same time I feel like if we keep going on dates like this its gonna add up fast and I cant really afford it right now without dipping into what I got saved up.

Should I just be honest and suggest something else? Or is this gonna make me look broke and kill the vibe. I also don't know if this means we're just on different pages about lifestyle stuff which could be a problem down the road.

Looking for clear, unbiased advice.

I \[34M\] recently moved to a new city.   Been here about three months on and off Hinge, which I have used previously and had some success with, while I settle in and got my apartment set up.  Ended up meeting a really nice girl \[30F\] and we have been dating for about a month.

  
Things were going great!  She left a long-term (5 year) relationship back in January and is looking for something new.  She just moved here like I did.  All of our dates went really well and weren't really ""run of the mill"".  We saw a movie one night and went to Dave and Busters, another we had dim sum and went to an Oktoberfest bar, another day we went to a museum, walked around the city, went to a jazz bar, and sat and talked on a bridge overlooking the city. During all of these, the conversations were great, silences weren't awkward, and we really seemed to gel/enjoy each other's company.  We had both admitted to liking each other a lot and were even talking about taking trips, etc. together in the near future.  There was a real connection.

The last date we went on was about 1.5 weeks ago. We spent a day together just running errands (Costco, etc.), grabbed some beers, and got dinner.  Things changed when we went back to her apartment. We had been kissing and being touchy since the second date but I was sort of hinting at wanting more. She made us tea and we were making out as usual. I asked if she wanted me to go as it was getting late.  She jokingly said ""maybe another five minutes"" and she led me to the bedroom where we undressed and I started hinting at wanting to go all the way.  After a while she seemed to want to go ahead with it and brought out a condom for me to use which I did.  TBH, I think I went a little hard with the sex (LOL), which is what I usually do and have found most girls like it - ass slapping, etc. nothing too crazy.  She commented that I was ""crazy"" in bed and she wasn't really expecting it from me.  I didn't perceive this as a bad thing at the time just by the way she said it, but her demeanor has changed pretty significantly since.  I'm scared I maybe gave her an ""ick"" or things ultimately ended up moving too fast for her.

She started taking longer to reply to texts, stopped sending pictures of random stuff throughout the day, etc.  Nothing crazy, but definitely a marked change in the communication we had going on before. We had plans that Tuesday (a couple of days after the sex) to go to a hockey game which she bailed on because she got sick after going on a hike and getting rained on.  No problem.  I asked how she was feeling on Thursday and she said she woke up feeling better.  My parents were coming into town that Saturday, which she knew, so I asked if maybe she wanted to go to dinner Friday night and she said she wanted to lay low while she fully recovered. Understood, no problem.  Didn't message her for the next few days while my parents were in town and she ended up messaging me on Sunday.  We had a normal, pleasant back and forth where she ended up saying she was going to a concert with a friend.  I found out this friend is a male that goes to the same school as her (through being a creep on IG, shamefully) - no idea if they had a relationship prior to us meeting, if he's gay, if they are genuinely platonic friends, nothing. It did make me feel a bit rough, though.  Where I really started feeling shitty is when I asked if she wanted to come over sometime this week for dinner.  She said she wouldn't be able to because of her workload/the fact that she had a work trip coming up on Monday,  She is actually in the first year of her PHD at a pretty prestigious university and juggling some remote jobs, so she is definitely busy. I just find it hard to believe that if I had asked her to come over for dinner a couple of weeks ago, she would have declined completely.  She suggested ""maybe"" grabbing coffee this weekend before she goes on her work trip.  I said ""yes maybe"".  I am like 85% sure t if I go for coffee, she will tell me she wants to slow down or is no longer interested in seeing me altogether.  I am DREADING it.  I really like this girl and was hoping there might be something there.

So here is my overall question:  Should I even go?  Should I just ask her via message or a phone call if there is something going on?  If I do go, do I try to act normal and let her bring up any issues and go from there?  Is all of this in my head?  Any advise would be really great.

1. During 2 whole months of dating, he only took my out on a proper dinner date once (last week) we usually chill at his place or we go for a walk..  

2. The dinner date was not ideal.. most of the mains were out of stuck.. he was constantly chatting and he barely touched his 6 raviolis‚Ä¶ at a point I was going to ask him to eat.. no wine was ordered.. it was short and after he wanted to go chill at his place..  

3. I noticed that he says lots of things but he never actions anything so he says he‚Äôs going to change his job in 3 months but he never started looking, he said he‚Äôs going to go look for an apartment 2 months ago but he never did.. 

4. He seems very close with this other girl at the gym, to a point were he gives her lots of attention and he ignores me. Like once he even was washing his hands with her in the bathroom‚Ä¶  and he also tends to train with her often. I have no issue with the training but she‚Äôs a complete beginner and he‚Äôs RX.. advanced crossfitter so the combo does not make sense‚Ä¶ unless something else is going on‚Ä¶ 

I mentioned that I feel isolated and pushed on the side when he treats her like that and ignores me. He acknowledge my feelings and he apologised but he kept on doing it‚Ä¶ one time - I saw time parked infront of eachother and they were talking near her car‚Ä¶ after I brought it up.. he told me you‚Äôre phishing but if you want to know I also went for coffee with her.. 

Now he suddenly started doing the evening classes (even though he said he prefers morning) and when I asked how come? He said it‚Äôs better for work.. but it does not make sense because he works late.. so he has to go to the gym and continue working after. This week I found out she‚Äôs booking those classes‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt want to keep on dating someone who has eyes for somone else.. especially after I had already brought it up.

Honesty is appreciated above being nice!","Often, I find myself in a situation that many people my age have found themselves. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not happy and I don‚Äôt know why or what to do‚Äù this simple thought crosses my mind so often it feels like a part of my regular internal dialogue and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. Typically the response from authority figures and peers alike is the same ‚Äúthat happens sometimes‚Äù, ‚Äúit gets better I promise‚Äù, ‚Äúits just everything happening right now, everyone‚Äôs a little depressed‚Äù, and the ever so titular ‚Äúmaybe you just need a different point of view‚Äù eventually you hear these sentiments so many times you start to believe it. Like some kind of emotional Stockholm syndrome, you really do think that it‚Äôs only a matter of time and everything will be fine again and it very well might. But then it happens again and again and longer and longer each time until you feel like there was never any happiness to begin with and you‚Äôre doomed to forever be in what everyone tells you is just a temporary state. I suspect that if you‚Äôve gotten this far then either you agree with me or are simply intrigued by the ideas in front of you, in either case I encourage you to continue reading. What I have to say may not be important in any grand scheme, but it is important to me that more people not only know that they‚Äôre not alone but also as a means of sharing my complicated, difficult emotions so that I, too, know that I am not alone.

For those who don‚Äôt exactly understand or don‚Äôt exactly know what I‚Äôm talking about it goes far beyond just general unhappiness. In my personal experience, it is a feeling of just emptiness like nothing you‚Äôre doing has any point, like you‚Äôre just stuck. The minutes turn into hours, hours to days, and before you know it a week passed you by in the time it takes for you to get up in the morning. Every day feels like you‚Äôve lived it before and all you‚Äôre doing is maintenance to keep your current life where it is, but I‚Äôm young and my life should be moving ahead not staying the same and yet here I am still in Syracuse doing the work, staying busy, ‚Äúmaking progress‚Äù but it just doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Over a year‚Äôs worth of work, keeping my head down doing what has to be done and moving forward has landed me in the exact same place I was. Almost nothing I‚Äôve done has left me feeling fulfilled or accomplished it all feels like work for the sake of work and maybe that‚Äôs the point to endlessly distract yourself from the feeling of emptiness, maybe it‚Äôs a cruel joke played on some by the universe, to be fueled to do more by your own feeling of inadequacy only to never feel adequate. It makes you feel like no matter what you do to pull yourself out of a rut that you‚Äôve subconsciously created you will always be in that rut no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you work, no matter what you do or achieve you will always be in a rut and unable to escape.

Maybe escape is the wrong thing to desire, to many this sort of feeling is envied and even praised. The idea of the tortured artist who dies young and is never appreciated in their lifetime for the work far ahead of their time, but why should they have to be tortured or dead for their work to have value, for their journey through life to be celebrated, why should people capable of greatness have to suffer for the world to recognize them as great. I do not think that I am one of those capable of greatness, nor do I think I could even comprehend what goes through their heads. I do not think my depression should be glorified, it has made me do so much in such a short time but I would trade every achievement, every scrap of praise, all of the progress if it meant I could be happy, and I mean truly happy the kind of happiness where you can find joy in a coffee stain on your shirt or that annoying cut just above your lip. The kind of happiness that makes you able to see past the rut, the joy that lets you see your failures as more than permanent stains on your personality but rather as troubles on the road to being better. But I don‚Äôt think I will ever feel better, every fall feels like starting my entire life back from square one but this time I have even more bad decisions under my belt.

Maybe I‚Äôm just not meant to be happy, perhaps I was never destined to be a good person and every time I‚Äôve been pushed back into the mud has just been a reminder from the world of what I‚Äôm supposed to be. Maybe I‚Äôm not supposed to get back up, but I‚Äôll never know because I keep standing back up and brushing myself off despite knowing exactly what happens next.

Because I‚Äôd usually wake up at the same time I usually do, and having slept only for 5-6 hours.

So not sleeping enough/sleeping late is a big trigger for me.

I‚Äôm still working on it (cutting screens and hour before bed/no coffee 5 hours before sleep)

And for extra protection, whenever I wake up I usually stay in bed for an extra hour or two to get in more hours. Just in case. I also track my sleep with my watch.

1odgko1,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1odgko1/relationship_with_food/,Relationship with food,"Hey there, I recieved many dms appreciating my last post. So thought of simplifying everything for you all. 

First of all, green tea, coffee or any other sponsored drink that a dumb dick sells is not going to get your stomach ""snatched"".
The only thing that matters is CALORIES IN AND CALORIES OUT. 

Carbs are not your enemy. Fats are not your enemy. Sugary drinks yeah they might be. 
Dont fear pizza or burger cause that's all they are. Food. Not bad or good food. Just food. 

So why is there fear around foods? Well they are generally higher in calories and are less satiating than say sweet potatoes so people tend to eat those and add other things so feel full. Leading to high calorie consumption. Does it mean that you have to give up your favorite cookies or papa John's Pizza? Heck no. I would rather have my fingers crushed  in a door than quit these bits of happiness from my life. 

The key is moderation. 

We all have our caloric window, in which we can eat absolutely anything we want and still lose weight. The snacks just tend to take a bit more space in that window leading to fear that pizza is bad and chicken breast boiled is good.

You can gain weight even if you eat way too many chicken and rice and lose weight even if you only eat  two burgers and not live a sedentary life. Choice is yours, given you also need fiber and you dont really get that much from those two slices of cabbage. 

Also getting into carbs. Carbs are not your enemy as people make it out to be. 1g of carbs hold 4g of water in your body. 

It's a bit more complex to explain but I'll try to make it simple. Basically if you are used to eating carbs and you switch to keto which is personally awful for me, you'll lose water weight which your body stores. Those massive reduction in weight is not fat. It's just water. That's all. Nothing miraculous in that.

You can gain weight even in keto diet if you go beyond your maintenance level. 

Carbs get the bad rep because people dont understand what happens with the body. 

1. Diet consisting of 1200 calories at maintenance level which has like 250g of protein and some fat and fiber will lead to a steady result on the scale. 

2. If you keep the calories the same and add carbs and reduce protein a bit and fat, it will lead to a massive spike on the scale. 

Now it's understandable how a person can feel that they have been eating the same calories and just started eating carbs and that led to weight gain and now you fear carbs. But understand that carbs are just holding more water making you look fuller too. I am sorry if I was not very clear with this one, i hope you get the idea. 


Also medications which says that side effect is weight gain, isn't making you gain weight by its own unless it's messing with hormones. Generally it's just making you hungrier which leads to you eating more and then you know gaining more weight, so people who deal with those have to be slightly more cautious. Mindful actually.  If I have missed any point I'll edit it in. Good luck ^‚Å†_‚Å†^",0,1761158192.0,beginnerfitness,1,0.33,False

It kinda came to me during a deep depressive episode, in which I mostly slept, and every and any action I did while awake felt as if not my own. Its not finished, nor editted that well, but I want to get some thoughts on this sleeping plague. thanks in advance :)  


**Exhaustion**



	My name is Montag, I currently work at a classified government site deep in the woods. I‚Äôm a researcher observing the progress of an ongoing experiment coined project ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù. ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù explores the effects of a drug in development to extend the waking hours of humans for productivities sake.

	I start my day waking up early in morning roughly 5:00 am, I quickly shower, brush my teeth, then get dressed. Today like most days I wear a short-sleeve graphic tee and a black dress pants. I have to look somewhat professional, so I usually cover my shirt, with my white work coat. I check the time on my phone, 5:15, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm falling behind‚Äù \*sigh\*. I‚Äôm gonna have to do without breakfast, I grab my lab ID, hanging by the door, and my car keys, and begin the commute to work.¬†

	I live on the outskirts of an undisclosed city, Its‚Äô usually a 30 minute drive through some run down neighborhoods, and around half way the scenery turns to forest. Mostly thick pine trees. The encroaching light begins to break through the darkness as I reach the security checkpoint.¬†

	It seems Todd is once again on morning shift. As my vehicle comes to a halt next to the gate, Todd is sleeping. Maybe he‚Äôs been here the whole night that blows. I reach out of my car, and tap on the glass. He weakly opens his eyes. ‚ÄúMontag..? Morning there bud.‚Äù I respond, ‚ÄúA long night?‚Äù I hand him my ID to scan, zzzp. ‚ÄúYeah I suppose, my sleep schedule has been pretty irregular of late. Oh, and your cleared to pass.‚Äù¬†

	I respond, ‚ÄúYou been takin‚Äô more shifts?‚Äù¬†

Todd: ‚ÄúNot really, perhaps I‚Äôm just getting old.‚Äù He slumps over a little\*

	‚ÄúTodd you‚Äôre not even 26‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú...Yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

	I see in the corner of my eye, the monitor in my car reads 5:55 am. ‚ÄúCrap, I gotta check in.‚Äù

	Todd: ‚Äúsee ya later Monty.‚Äù

‚ÄúLaters!‚Äù I pull forward past the fence, and drive for 3 minutes, into heavy woods, to a parking lot on the side of the mountain. Still surrounded by pine trees, with big security doors, buried perhaps 5 feet in the mountain on the edge of the parking lot. Beyond the outer doors lies a small entryway, with a camera in the top corner, and two more large doors, with a scanner. I use my card, and hear a beep, I look to the camera. The camera moved a little, a voice comes through the intercom, ‚ÄúIdentity confirmed, Montag you may proceed.‚Äù The door unlocks, and slowly opens. Perhaps one foot thick steel door. Entering the facility I pass the through metal corridors, like a labyrinth. I approach my lab area.

	The facility is less occupied than usual. Curious? ‚ÄúI guess its just me hear today.‚Äù my lab is empty. I turn on various machines, the begin buzzing. I speak into a microphone to log experimental details. ‚Äú6:23 am beginning gas ‚ÄúLull-aby-v24.3‚Äù Dispensing at regular intervals on and off every other 30 minutes until‚Ä¶ 10:23 am.‚Äù¬†

	We haven‚Äôt started human trials yet, for now we are using mice. I‚Äôm currently working with ‚ÄúJimbo‚Äù the mouse. We‚Äôve been working together for about a month now, and I‚Äôve observed an increase of active hours. He‚Äôs now been consistently been awake for about 22 hours every day.¬†

	The gas slowly hisses into a test chamber. Jimbo seems unaffected. Over the last month I‚Äôve noticed that his eyes have been growing increasingly closed, while remaining to act fully awake.¬†

	I observed him for the remainder of my shift, with no notable changes. The gas has now stopped, so I open the test chamber and handle Jimbo. I‚Äôm a bit of an animal person, so before putting him back into his home, I give him some treats and some pets. Then I grab some files, to finish up some work at home, and begin the signout process. I wander through the facility, More people have appeared since this morning. Around a dozen people, no one I recognize, since were all from different departments.¬†

	I walk towards the exit, before being stopped by someone at the security desk, ‚ÄúHey, you! I just gotta make sure you‚Äôve been informed that all operations have been cancelled for the rest of the weak.‚Äù¬†

	‚ÄúThanks for the headsup.‚Äù Now I gotta find some other way to spend my time this weak.

I exit throught the security doors, and walk through the parking lot. And notice some employees catching up on some sleep in their cars, not that unusual I suppose. I start my car, and turn on the radio, and once again drive through the security checkpoint. Todd‚Äôs shift seemed to have ended. The security guard, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre clear to leave.‚Äù¬†

	I nearly finish my commute home, and remember I should probably grab groceries for the week. I head to a small mart for a few things, everything seems as average as ever. Nothing to note.

	I finally make it home, and have dinner. Ugh, I‚Äôm to tired to finish work, well work resumes next week so I‚Äôm in no rush. Time for bed.¬†



	Huh? A dream? I look around, I‚Äôm surrounded by darkness, with nothing in sight, just darkness. However it appears as if I‚Äôm walking on water, dark, water as if the open ocean at night. I wander forward, still nothing new‚Ä¶ wait, I feel this sudden gaze as if I‚Äôm being watched. I look around nervously, behind me‚Ä¶ a great distance away I see what looks like a human figure, deeply shrouded in the darkness, appearing as just a silhouette.

	I awake, in a nervous sweat. What the hell? Not a very peaceful night‚Ä¶ Looking around I notice its rather light out. But wait, what am I doing on my couch. I thought I was in my bed? On the table lies some the files I brought home and my laptop. Huh?

	Strange‚Ä¶ A notification from my inbox, ‚ÄúAlert: possible breach.‚Äù It reads ‚ÄúLately we‚Äôve been observing a notable increase in ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù employees. This may be caused by a breach in the facility, thus operations have been temporarily stopped.‚Äù Oh shit‚Ä¶ have some of us been exposed to ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù??? Have I? OK lets not panic, I guess I‚Äôll just try and lay low this week, and try and make observations while I‚Äôm at it.

	This is still rather unsettling. I‚Äôll go grab some motion detection cameras, and come home, so I can record my night activity.

	Its maybe 6:00pm, and I‚Äôm rather bored, I decide to do some people watching. Out my apartment window, I suppose to see how the other half lives. Just a bunch of people enjoying a night out, coming and going from bars, and such. When I notice a group of people clearly under the influence of something, perhaps drunk. Some of them start to pretend sleep walking‚Ä¶ making fun of a homeless man‚Ä¶ walking with shut eyes‚Ä¶. People can be rather cruel.

	That soured my mood, I‚Äôll play some videogames for a bit then get some sleep. As I lay in bed I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that homeless man. Theres no.. way‚Ä¶ I drift into sleep.

	Surrounded by darkness. Oh christ, the same dream again?? Ugh, I begin to wander some more, but overtime somethings begin to appear, buildings, becoming visible, as if whipping off real dirty glass, almost like the buildings are constructed of fog. I can‚Äôt decide whether or not this is more or less ominous than before. But this intrigue, was quickly overshadowed by‚Ä¶ That figure again. A black silhoutte, the one from yesterday, again. This time only it seems closer. I begin walking faster, then I fall through the deep dark water, sinking. In a panic, then I wake.¬†

	Same as before, a cold sweat, my coach again. \~yawn\~ I check my laptop, to look over what the motion cameras may have caught. But, when I open my laptop, I check the footage, and see myself. Sleep walking, and going immediately toward the cameras and shut them off. Well‚Ä¶ this is annoying. I don‚Äôt know what I was doing then.¬†

	I‚Äôve come up empty handed, and wait, its 9:00am. Not strange by itself, but I don‚Äôt usually get up this late. A side effect of ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù? I quickly check my email, and see another notification, a group email thread from other employees. The email reads, ‚Äúhas anyone else been walking through darkness?‚Äù a bunch of responses, mostly responding yes. And whilst scrolling through responses, a new one just came through. ‚ÄúAlert: all employees remain indoors to the best of you abilities. We think the project ‚ÄúLullaby‚Äù may be transmissable‚Ä¶ avoid contact‚Äù¬† That email bounced around through my head.¬†

	Its spreading‚Ä¶? The homeless man‚Ä¶ Todd‚Ä¶ oh god. I turn on the news, and begin looking out my windows. On tv in the background I see some sleep walkers‚Ä¶ outside, more people going about there days with closed eyes.¬†

	At this point I can‚Äôt tell if i‚Äôm just being paranoid. I hope I‚Äôm just being paranoid

I‚Äôve only been awake for a few hours now, the clock reads 12:00am. Yet I‚Äôm feeling rather sleepy already. I should make some coffee to try and stay awake. A few swigs later, I wait for the caffeine to kick in. But to no avail, still I feel tired. My eyes begin to dim, my vision bugging up and down, trying to stay awake. The clock reads 1:30pm, as my eyes drag across my laptop screen I notice a word file open.

	Strange I don‚Äôt remember opening a word doc.. Losing strength, I open the document. The Document looked almost like a report I would have typed up in my lab. But much of the report were periods, followed by short bursts of observations. Things like.

	‚ÄúHe has just fallen asleep‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I expect to have ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ours left while hes in the dark‚Ä¶.. Time is growwingg‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be back soon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Our time‚Ä¶.ooo see the world‚Ä¶.. To record me‚Ä¶.. Camera unplugged‚Ä¶. Peaceful sleep‚Ä¶

	It seems like i was talking about myself in 2nd person‚Ä¶ thats rather unsettling‚Ä¶¬†

	‚Ä¶At the top of the document it reads last modified 8:55 am. Just before I woke up.. A growing anxiety is welling up from within me, but, I cant shake this intense drowsiness. Before I know it my eyes begin to flutter, then shut.

Everything was new for me here no friends nothing and only known people would be my colleagues. First week went by & I got to know few of the coworkers & one of them was F23 and one of my teammates introduced us. She was very friendly and used to say Hi and had eye contacts and all consistently! I wasn‚Äôt into her at all but I went to talk and wanted to know what she and her team does to get better idea of surroundings so we talked for half an hour post work in office itself and she asked me if you want to explore we can go together so I said yeah I don‚Äôt know anything here anyways and I‚Äôd love to have company!
So one weekend we went out we spent long time (8 hours) together and it wasn‚Äôt a date but whatever we did was nothing less than a date. 
She‚Äôs pretty and I‚Äôm decent too (6‚Äô1‚Äù tall and I do get attention most of the time) but I never thought about her like that till next day. We totally behaved like couples, movie coffee dance at club, beach talks what not. She was very touchy feely holding hands and when I thought about it next day it was totally like unsaid date and I really enjoyed that!

Next week we kept talking during office and all, we met after office it was going good for a week. Then on coming weekend i asked to go out and explore she was unwell (genuinely) so we cancelled it twice since she wasn‚Äôt recovered! 
Then I made a mistake I asked thrice(including two failed plans earlier) to meet and gave her lot of attention than I should have! I guess It felt clingy yet she was talking to me as usually sharing things but she‚Äôs seems like she pulled away and now we are away for diwali break. She‚Äôs not a text person and I don‚Äôt want to be clingy anymore so I‚Äôm gonna give her space. We haven‚Äôt texted much during diwali break.

Now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve lost it and this might end without even starting.. Any chances of recovery? It‚Äôs been 2 weeks only
She was totally into me during first 2-3 meets I‚Äôm üíØ sure! Although i haven‚Äôt done anything disastrous or any confessions yet but my overthinking says its done :( 
I really like her and want this to go ahead!
It‚Äôs really hard for me since I don‚Äôt have anyone here and if she goes away like this it‚Äôd be very difficult for me to handle at this point!!

Idk if I should even post this, but I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about this crazy coincidence that happened last weekend.

So, I went on a trip to South Goa with two of my friends. We were staying at a small beachside cottage at Agonda Beach, right next to this cozy restaurant called Sonho do Mar. Every morning, I‚Äôd head there for breakfast. That‚Äôs where I saw this girl  absolute natural beauty, just effortlessly charming.

She was staying there with her 4 friends. The first time I noticed her was when she came walking from the beach, washing off the sand at the shower area near the restaurant. The same thing happened the next morning too  she‚Äôd come around the same time, and we‚Äôd just sort of notice each other like two strangers vacationing in the same place. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it then maybe just a random attraction or beach crush, you know?

Fast forward to Monday night, our last day in Goa. We had our train back from Vasco da Gama to Bangalore, so we spent the day exploring Vasco and Baga before heading to the station. Our train was at 10 PM, and around 7 we stopped by a small caf√© opposite Vasco railway station to chill for a bit.

And guess what? I saw her again sitting just a couple of tables away with her friends! My friend noticed first and nudged me, and I was honestly stunned but brushed it off as a coincidence. Maybe she had the same train or something.

We boarded the train, reached Bangalore the next morning, and I totally forgot about it‚Ä¶ until I saw her again at the Bangalore railway station! Still thought it was a wild coincidence, until I boarded the JP Nagar metro, and she got off at the exact same stop. That was my ‚Äúholy sh*t‚Äù moment. She looked at me, smiled softly, and walked away.

I don‚Äôt know her name, her Insta, nothing. Just that she probably lives somewhere around JP Nagar.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôve got over 50 offers available today, but please note:

üö´üö´ THERE ARE NO SANDWICHES, NO SNACK WRAPS, NO NUGGETS, NO FRAPPES, NO SHAKES, NO SMOOTHIES, NO COFFEES, AND NO SODAS. üö´üö´

Only three items are available today:  
üçü Small Fries  
üç¶ Vanilla Cones  
ü•ß Apple Pies

If you are not interested in one of these three items, do not sign up for this giveaway.



The reason for this limited menu is simple: in the last few giveaways, too many people have been picky ‚Äî putting their name in and then declining when their turn comes because I didn‚Äôt have a cheeseburger, snack wrap, or larger item available. That wastes a lot of time and leaves smaller rewards unclaimed.



As a result, I‚Äôve ended up with a surplus of fries, cones, and pies, and this giveaway is focused on clearing those out so that future giveaways can include a wider mix again.



This kind of behavior also prevents others from getting free food ‚Äî the time I spend DMing someone who only wants one specific item could have been spent helping three people who would have gladly accepted what was available.



‚ö†Ô∏è GOING FORWARD:  
Anyone who repeatedly signs up and then declines offers because they don‚Äôt want smaller items will be blocked from future giveaways.



I‚Äôm doing my best to keep this fair for everyone, and that means I‚Äôll follow the rules as written and expect everyone participating to do the same.



I will not respond to unsolicited DMs under any circumstance.



If you‚Äôre confused about the rules, please reread them ‚Äî they‚Äôre clearly laid out below.



If you still need help, look through the comments and find someone who has already received food; they might be able to walk you through it since I‚Äôll be busy coordinating active orders.



üì£ When I reply ‚Äúyou‚Äôre next in line,‚Äù that means I‚Äôll be contacting you within 10‚Äì15 minutes.  
Please be ready to head to or already at a McDonald‚Äôs so that when your turn arrives, you‚Äôre prepared to pick up your reward right away.



# üçü How This Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Comment ‚ÄúInterested.‚Äù

* Don‚Äôt request specific items ‚Äî the menu and availability change constantly.
* Make it a new top-level comment (not a reply).
* I‚Äôll reply with your number in line.
* If you can‚Äôt stay available, please comment to remove yourself so I can move faster.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unsolicited DMs = ignored.

* I‚Äôll contact you first when it‚Äôs your turn.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Once I DM you, you‚Äôll have 10 minutes to respond or I‚Äôll move to the next person.

4Ô∏è‚É£ When it‚Äôs your turn, I‚Äôll ask:

* The ZIP code of the McDonald‚Äôs you‚Äôll pick up from
* Whether you‚Äôre using drive-thru or counter
* Then I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs still available.

5Ô∏è‚É£ After I place your order, I‚Äôll send a screenshot with your pickup code.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Reply to your original comment once you‚Äôve picked up your food so others know it‚Äôs legit.



# üïí Quick Notes

* The app sometimes glitches between states ‚Äî please be patient.

top row: from left, its a beast!! arabian oud woody style (lasts on clothes for a week easily) and lattafa‚Äôs lail maleki a sweet fruity punch vibe for and also a total compliment getter(no cap). then two rayhaan perfumes, crimson and elixir both are chefs kiss. crimson was a blind buy but super unique, shagaf oud azraq by swiss arabian is also one of my absolute favorites. last one is figo black by al nuaim (nm to say its ok but the roll on is very last longingly good)

middle row: tales rio by titan skinn; my everyday fragrance. i love how it smells and it lasts long on clothes. projects well for about 3 hours with my body heat. 
then there is olga inspirations (aventus, tam dao, Y, sauvage) ‚Äî> grabbed these because i couldnt afford the originals.. out of them, only Y lasts the longest on me.

base row: born bold from perfumory a recreation of valentino uomo born in roma intense. the rest are local blends from mannady (im from chennai, its a famous spot for attars, roll-ons and spray perfumes). i bought coffee note, pdm althair, coolwater, bdc, mm by the fireplace, jpg ultra male, adg pour homme, and tf tobacco vanille. checked them against the real ones and they‚Äôre shockingly close.

remaining are decant samples and some are from bombay shaving company( i liked only miami from them it has the bubblegummy smell) . the bottom two travel bottles are khamrah and lv imagination (also from mannady).",7,1761157652.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,1.0,False

To rewind a bit website design was never something I really wanted to get into, apps were always the big thing I wanted to make due to being such an Steve Jobs fan boy. But when I was in college, I heard that the coffee shop I worked at needed a new website, so I told them that I could make it (I'd never made a website before) I borrowed my Dad's wordpress account to start building it and somehow managed to charge ¬£800 for it and immediately realised that this was the way to go. At least it was somewhat related to app building.

About a year or two in to making websites for just about anyone, I managed to get a car detailing client from a facebook group post who was looking for a website designer. They were based in Houston Texas (I'm based in the UK) so that felt pretty cool. We ended up making a great website and I got so many referrals from it I decided to setup a whole agency around just serving car detailing businesses.

It went well, but as the clients grew so did the hours, the list of people I needed to respond to, a few missed a deadlines here and there due to poor workload management, as well as some projects that ended up taking up all my time, got me to the point where I think a few entrepreneurs get to where they're like ""Why am I even doing this?""

Fast forward three years and I hadn't grown or changed anything even though my work load increased, it was just making me miserable. I was the bottle neck to my business and definitely the problem. I knew I needed to change but something deep down was stopping me.

It got to the point where I had to decide am I going to take the plunge and start scaling the agency (Something I've always been cautious of because of a fear that I'd drop the ball) or do I get smarter with what I'm doing and remove the bottle neck in a different way?

But the decision had already been made for me without me even realising...

In my downtime I'd been messing around with coding a platform that basically allows detailers to take the best bits from my detailing websites, like before and after sliders, pricing tables based on vehicle sizes, high converting contact forms etc and just embed them on their website. I was building something that I genuinely could use myself to speed up my design process and would probably help other people to get what they need as well.

And I'll tell you what, after working on other people's businesses for so long, starting from scratch again with every new client, it's been so refreshing to turn my process and everything I've learnt into a productised business that feels like something that's more of my own. I'll obviously still make changes to improve things like hiring help and getting better systems set up, but just this small tweak that taps into what I really love to do has made doing that much more appealing.

TLDR; The idea that I can help more people, build cool stuff all without the constant deadlines or chance of letting people down when things get busy is just amazing and I can't wait for this new phase.",1,1761157645.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1. A big truck suddenly swerved into my lane. I grabbed the wheel and swerved to avoid a collision. It is possible that SuperCruise would have swerved in time but I don't know. What do you think?  
2. I was driving in a construction zone when suddenly SuperCruise steered my car into the lane to the right where there was another car. I had to act fast to avoid a collision. It seems SuperCruise didn't notice that the lanes were turning left. What do you think about that?  
3. when using SuperCruise, I am even more likely to get the Drowsy Driving coffee cup popup. In general, the car seems think I am drowsy a lot more often than I feel drowsy. I wonder if using SuperCruise causes me to relax more and am therefore more likely to trigger the popup. Comments?

In general, I'm not very confident in SuperCruise for these reasons but I haven't used it much. It is fun to watch it work but if I get one more reason to distrust it, I will probably only use it again on straight roads with light traffic. ",2,1761157555.0,CadillacOptiq,9,0.75,False

Reader discretion advised, I wanted to write a story about overcoming these traumas, and I hope I succeeded.


The next few days I spent with Alex, I was rattled by what Damien had done, and I just didn‚Äôt want to be alone. We played games on his playstation, watched shitty movies, went out to the bar, it felt like nothing had changed between us. All my worries and reservations about him just stopped feeling important all of a sudden, I just needed to take my mind off of things. I made Alex read what Cat had written to me recently, that strange story about the fur trappers and the lost colony, and we discussed it at the dive bar over a few beers.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your take on this?‚Äù I asked him, nursing a Corona.

‚ÄúHard to say really, it feels like a historical account. Could it be something she read somewhere?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs always a possibility‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúBut then how would she know about all the internal stuff? The thoughts and feelings of the guys.‚Äù

Alex set down his beer, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs processing her own struggle through a proxy‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs what everybody tells me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù Alex pressed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know man,‚Äù I sighed, taking another swig, ‚ÄúIt's like this is important to her. She‚Äôs emailing them directly to me, she keeps telling me she needs my help, but I don‚Äôt know how to help her.‚Äù 

Alex set down his drink, regarding me thoughtfully, ‚ÄúI think she just needs you to listen to her Jack, sometimes that‚Äôs all it takes.‚Äù

We parted ways that night, I‚Äôd spent too much time away from home, avoiding my parents. I didn‚Äôt know how to explain what was going on to them, so I thought it was best to leave them to deal with their problems while I tackled mine. But then I heard the squishing noise again, fading in, fading out. I was on foot this time, so I prepared myself to sprint or hide from whatever was lurking beyond the streetlamps. I kept walking, and the sound seemed far away, but it wasn‚Äôt until I was under the flickering light of a faulty street lamp that he spoke.

‚ÄúI need your help!‚Äù The voice was male, and it sounded sick, gurgling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water. I turned around to face him, all I could see was the outline of a large man, taller than me, standing just beyond the reach of the flickering lamplight. ‚ÄúI need your help!‚Äù he said again.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any money‚Äù I answered, stepping away, further under the light. 

‚ÄúI need your help, Jackie,‚Äù he called. My blood ran cold, I said nothing. He stepped towards me, slowly entering the light which described his form in silent shocks of lightning. It was the bald man from the bar the night I met Alex.

‚ÄúGregory?‚Äù I asked cautiously, there was something really wrong with him, his neck looked swollen and his eyes seemed to be bulging from his face. His skin was pale and glistening, like he was running a terrible fever.

‚ÄúI need your help Jackie.‚Äù He said it again, before he keeled over coughing. I pulled out my phone ready to call 911. 

‚ÄúGreg, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked, slowly approaching. Liquid started pouring out of him, I thought he was throwing up copious amounts of alcohol. As I approached his coughs persisted as more clear liquid splashed onto the pavement between us. I could see something moving in the pool that was forming beneath him, like wriggling slugs. Suddenly, he lurched forward and I instinctively grasped his arm to stop him from falling over. 

A shooting pain ran through my wrist as he grabbed it with a strangely slimy hand, his coughing became forced, rhythmic, he was laughing.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have done that Jackie!‚Äù He cackled, slowly rising to his full height, ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs gonna get you!!‚Äù His face looked soft and malleable, like uncooked dough. I tried to wrench my hand away but his grip was tight and painful. All around me, I could hear the sound of squishing, wet shuffling, getting steadily louder. A deep rattle followed it, almost melodious, like the growl of a dog forming some cadence and discordant resonance. The broken street lamp illuminated his disgusting mouth frame by frame as it split open revealing teeth that shouldn‚Äôt have looked so sharp. ‚ÄúJackie! Please don‚Äôt tell mom and dad!‚Äù He mocked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone now, little Jackie‚Ä¶ And he‚Äôs coming for you, he knows your blood‚Äù Gregory pulled me closer, leering into the side of my face.

My body relaxed all at once, panic gave way into cold understanding. I reached around to my back pocket and pulled out the mace I‚Äôd bought to deal with Gregory specifically. Without breaking eye contact, I flicked the safety off and sent a thin stream directly into those gross bulging eyes. 

Gregory screamed and let go of my arm, he keeled over holding his face as I separated from him. Turning around, I was met with a horrifying scene. We were surrounded by figures standing just outside the light of the streetlamp, completely motionless. An army of silhouettes blocked my escape from every direction, and Greg was quickly regaining his balance. Without thinking, I took the only chance I had and broke into a dead sprint directly towards the shapes in the dark. I hit one of them head on with all of my weight, knocking it to the side like a drunkard at a metal show. I was lucky they weren‚Äôt armed. It was easier to slip past them than I expected, they didn‚Äôt even try to stop me, and they seemed‚Ä¶ wet. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I got home.

When I entered my house, it was dark. I dropped the keys to the floor before my knees suddenly gave out. I slumped to the ground, a shaking wreck. Tugging my hair from between my fingers, breathing raggedly there in the dark. It was happening again. All of it was happening again. The image of that face I will not name swam into view, that wrenching in my chest building as my head jerked to the side. I slammed my fist into the wall, sharp pain sparking hard under my knuckles. My head jerked again, pulling away from that face as it breathed raggedly on my neck. My shoulders tensed and I spasmed on the floor, shaking that invisible body off of me. I wore myself out in under five minutes, coming back to my senses with my face pressed against cool tiles, tracing the grout with the tip of my fingernail.

I woke up again that night. Turning over in my bed, reaching for my vape on the bedside table. My eyes ached as I fought to close them, wishing I could sleep through the night just once in my life. I drifted away, curled on my stomach, restlessly searching for a position my aching knees could suffer just a few hours more. A hand was on my hip, I hadn‚Äôt noticed it before. It rested there gently, like whoever it belonged to was deep in a slumber. Did I go to bed with somebody? I tried to turn over, but the hand suddenly gripped the side of my pelvis with force, holding me in place. I struggled, twisting my back to face the room. The lights were on, and somebody was sitting on my bed. Two other people towered over me, on either side. Their faces were blank, expectant, as whoever was touching me pressed me forward, back into that position. I fought and struggled, adrenaline forcing its way through me. I screamed as hands wrapped around my face, too many hands, clenching my mouth and nose. I struggled for breath as I writhed. Kicking with no contact, punching into nothing, my arms were heavy, so much heavier than they should have been. My body felt like lead as I was pushed back onto my stomach, my face buried into that dark pillow, smothering me. An arm clenching tight around my throat, a body weighing me down like bricks on my back. 

I woke up with a shriek, my bed still rattling from the violence of my body as I struggled against that unseen enemy. A night terror, that‚Äôs all it was. I soothed myself with explanations as I checked the time: 4:15. Of course. I forced my eyes awake as I scrolled through my phone, hoping for some distraction in the mindless sludge of the internet.


The sky was dark that morning as I sped up the freeway, my windshield streaked with the rain that had come in the night. The call had come, and I was the only one awake to hear it: Cat had gone missing. My parents were just getting ready as I was peeling off the driveway, already considering all possible answers: she got lost, she's scared, she needed fresh air. All ideas that paled in comparison to that one horrifying thought, that she had done it. That thing I had thought of, I know our mother and father had tried, that I had tried. These horrors of a family bound together with love and grief. I prayed she hadn't fallen to that awful thought, that something stopped her hand, headlights, stars, the friendly face of a stranger. Anything, just anything to make her hesitate.

The clouds above were just beginning to lighten as my headlights illuminated the facade of that place. My hands were shaking as I pulled the key and tumbled out of the driver's side, already racing to the front of that building. Agonizing seconds passed as I waited for an answer to my knock, but the door opened, revealing the face of the nurse I had seen before. I had no chance to speak, before her hand was up in a pacifying gesture, ‚Äúit's okay, she's safe. We found her.‚Äù 

She led me past that thick oak door to the couch in their foyer, the hall was dark, still dripping with the silence of the early morning. Only a shaded table light was on by the couch as I made my way to sit on that cold leather, ‚Äúwe found her on the road, she was heading west.‚Äù The nurse reported.

‚ÄúDid she say anything?‚Äù I asked, hesitant to feel that relief I wanted so badly.

‚ÄúShe said she needed to get to the water‚Äù the nurse stated, ‚ÄúShe wanted to listen to the waves.‚Äù
 
I sat there and waited for two hours until the wake-up time. Someone pushed a coffee into my hands, as I tiredly looked over the last message she had sent me. Wondering what was going through her mind, what made her write this, and then decide to go to the ocean? I thought she was afraid of the water, I thought her writings were expressing that. The idea that something was in there, something that hurt her. But why then? Why go back?

My parents silently sat next to me. My father fighting against the sleep that still wanted him, my mother illuminated by the light of her phone, anxiously searching, scrolling, looking for answers or reaching out to family. We said nothing, until the light peaked in, and movement was heard in the rooms above us. 

A nurse came to us then, ‚ÄúShe's dressed now, she said you can come and see her‚Äù, before leading us up to her room. The stairs were ornate, winding up the wall in a curve that felt soothing to the mind. I felt glad that she had landed at an inpatient center that was a mansion in the hills instead of a cold, sterile bunk in a hospital. 

The nurse opened the door to reveal two small beds and a tiny window. Mindless pour-painted art on the walls with delicate script saying ‚Äúlive free‚Äù. And there she was, my sister. Cat was curled up as tight as can be. Her knees bunched to her chest, her head hanging deep into them. Her arms wrapped around herself so tight, like she was afraid to let go.

‚ÄúCat? Sweetie?‚Äù My mom said, gently sitting next to her, draping an arm around her, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù She traced her fingers through raggedy hair as I slowly sat down across from her.

‚ÄúNo‚Äù was all she said, the same way she did when I spoke to her before. I gently rested my hand on her knee.

‚ÄúHey girly‚Äù I whispered, ‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù I gave her a squeeze on her knee, hoping she felt it as a gesture of comfort. 

She raised her head, blue eyes peering at me from under her knotted hair. Eyes that didn't match the seafoam green of our mother, eyes like the sea after a raging storm, ‚ÄúI waited for you, but you never came‚Äù

I was unsettled, but I persisted, ‚ÄúI'm always here for you Cat, you just have to call-‚Äù

‚ÄúI waited centuries by the shore, I felt your heartbeat in the waters, but when that day came you turned away‚Äù, Cats voice felt wrong, her words didn't feel like her own. 

‚ÄúI-I'm sorry Cat, I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you. I know, I couldn't be there. But I'm here now, please tell me what I can do, how can I help you?‚Äù I begged, my throat choking on the guilt I was feeling. I had left her here. I was gone. I went off to New York and left my baby sister here, and this is what had happened to her.

‚ÄúYou chose her over me, you wanted this to happen Jaqueline! You gave yourself away! Like trash! Like filth!‚Äù Cat screamed at me. She kicked and spasmed as she spoke, her back arching into our mom as she wrapped her arms around her.

‚ÄúCat!‚Äù I cried, ""I'm sorry! I'm so sorry Cat! I shouldn't have left!‚Äù I stood up from the bed.

‚ÄúGet out Jack!‚Äù My mom commanded me, but I stood frozen.

‚ÄúPlease, Cat, I want to help, please just tell me-‚Äù 

‚ÄúJAQUELINE DANIELLE HARRISON‚Äù my mom commanded, ‚Äúget out of this room!‚Äù.

I stood motionless for just a beat, overcome with the sight of my sister writhing in my mother's arms, before I turned and pushed past our stony father into the hallway.

My gut wrenched once I had left the room, two nurses passing me in that hallway, entering Cat's dorm to calm her. That was my deadname, and it felt wrong to be hurt from it. I felt wrong, like my existence had hurt her. My existence hurt my baby sister so bad, that my own mother‚Ä¶ our mother denied me, she denied who I was, because I was hurting her. 

I released silent tears as I stumbled back into my car, tired and struggling with the weight of all that had happened. I can‚Äôt live like this. I can't go on like this. I have to fight it, I have to change this. I have to save my baby sister.

I‚Äôm a solo rider who started my riding journey back in 2022, and over time, I‚Äôve completely fallen in love with the charm of Coorg (Kodagu). I‚Äôve visited a few times but this time, I really want to explore the district in depth not just the popular tourist spots, but also the hidden gems that make Coorg so peaceful and unique.

If anyone here has traveled across Coorg or knows the area well, I‚Äôd love your suggestions on the following:

* Cozy stays or homestays surrounded by nature or coffee plantations (preferably peaceful ones suitable for solo travelers).
* Coffee or spice plantations that offer authentic tours or experiences.
* Trekking routes or scenic trails that aren‚Äôt too crowded but offer great nature vibes.
* Best sunrise or sunset viewpoints anywhere that gives that perfect blend of mist, hills, and calm.
* Any local food spots or cafes you think shouldn‚Äôt be missed.

I‚Äôll be riding from Bangalore/Kannur, and I‚Äôm hoping to spend at least a few days soaking in the culture, nature, and tranquility.

1odg8i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1odg8i9/relationship_with_food/,Relationship with food,"Hey there, I recieved many dms appreciating my last post. So thought of simplifying everything for you all. 

First of all, green tea, coffee or any other sponsored drink that a dumb dick sells is not going to get your stomach ""snatched"".
The only thing that matters is CALORIES IN AND CALORIES OUT. 

Carbs are not your enemy. Fats are not your enemy. Sugary drinks yeah they might be. 
Dont fear pizza or burger cause that's all they are. Food. Not bad or good food. Just food. 

So why is there fear around foods? Well they are generally higher in calories and are less satiating than say sweet potatoes so people tend to eat those and add other things so feel full. Leading to high calorie consumption. Does it mean that you have to give up your favorite cookies or papa John's Pizza? Heck no. I would rather have my fingers crushed  in a door than quit these bits of happiness from my life. 

The key is moderation. 

We all have our caloric window, in which we can eat absolutely anything we want and still lose weight. The snacks just tend to take a bit more space in that window leading to fear that pizza is bad and chicken breast boiled is good.

You can gain weight even if you eat way too many chicken and rice and lose weight even if you only eat  two burgers and not live a sedentary life. Choice is yours, given you also need fiber and you dont really get that much from those two slices of cabbage. 

Also getting into carbs. Carbs are not your enemy as people make it out to be. 1g of carbs hold 4g of water in your body. 

It's a bit more complex to explain but I'll try to make it simple. Basically if you are used to eating carbs and you switch to keto which is personally awful for me, you'll lose water weight which your body stores. Those massive reduction in weight is not fat. It's just water. That's all. Nothing miraculous in that.

You can gain weight even in keto diet if you go beyond your maintenance level. 

Carbs get the bad rep because people dont understand what happens with the body. 

1. Diet consisting of 1200 calories at maintenance level which has like 250g of protein and some fat and fiber will lead to a steady result on the scale. 

2. If you keep the calories the same and add carbs and reduce protein a bit and fat, it will lead to a massive spike on the scale. 

Now it's understandable how a person can feel that they have been eating the same calories and just started eating carbs and that led to weight gain and now you fear carbs. But understand that carbs are just holding more water making you look fuller too. I am sorry if I was not very clear with this one, i hope you get the idea. 


Also medications which says that side effect is weight gain, isn't making you gain weight by its own unless it's messing with hormones. Generally it's just making you hungrier which leads to you eating more and then you know gaining more weight, so people who deal with those have to be slightly more cautious. Mindful actually.

1odg6yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1odg6yw/turning_my_web_design_agency_into_a_saas_business/,"Turning my web design agency into a SaaS business for car detailers, and haven't had this much fun in years.","I was genuinely getting ready to throw in the towel with my website design agency.

To rewind a bit website design was never something I really wanted to get into, apps were always the big thing I wanted to make due to being such an Steve Jobs fan boy. But when I was in college, I heard that the coffee shop I worked at needed a new website, so I told them that I could make it (I'd never made a website before) I borrowed my Dad's wordpress account to start building it and somehow managed to charge ¬£800 for it and immediately realised that this was the way to go. At least it was somewhat related to app building.

About a year or two in to making websites for just about anyone, I managed to get a car detailing client from a facebook group post who was looking for a website designer. They were based in Houston Texas (I'm based in the UK) so that felt pretty cool. We ended up making a great website and I got so many referrals from it I decided to setup a whole agency around just serving car detailing businesses.

It went well, but as the clients grew so did the hours, the list of people I needed to respond to, a few missed a deadlines here and there due to poor workload management, as well as some projects that ended up taking up all my time, got me to the point where I think a few entrepreneurs get to where they're like ""Why am I even doing this?""  
  
Fast forward three years and I hadn't grown or changed anything even though my work load increased, it was just making me miserable. I was the bottle neck to my business and definitely the problem. I knew I needed to change but something deep down was stopping me.

It got to the point where I had to decide am I going to take the plunge and start scaling the agency (Something I've always been cautious of because of a fear that I'd drop the ball) or do I get smarter with what I'm doing and remove the bottle neck in a different way?

But the decision had already been made for me without me even realising...

In my downtime I'd been messing around with coding a platform that basically allows detailers to take the best bits from my detailing websites, like before and after sliders, pricing tables based on vehicle sizes, high converting contact forms etc and just embed them on their website. I was building something that I genuinely could use myself to speed up my design process and would probably help other people to get what they need as well.

And I'll tell you what, after working on other people's businesses for so long, starting from scratch again with every new client, it's been so refreshing to turn my process and everything I've learnt into a productised business that feels like something that's more of my own. I'll obviously still make changes to improve things like hiring help and getting better systems set up, but just this small tweak that taps into what I really love to do has made doing that much more appealing.

TLDR; The idea that I can help more people, build cool stuff all without the constant deadlines or chance of letting people down when things get busy is just amazing and I can't wait for this new phase.
