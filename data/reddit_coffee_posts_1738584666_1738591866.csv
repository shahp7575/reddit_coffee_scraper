1igpwgy,https://i.redd.it/b652cyy0mxge1.jpeg,Starbucks is cutting 30% of its menu,"Starbucks is making a bold move to simplify its operations by cutting 30% of its menu in the coming months. CEO Brian Niccol explained during an earnings call that the company‚Äôs extensive menu has created inefficiencies, leading to longer wait times and a more complex ordering process. While the specific items being removed were not disclosed, Starbucks has already discontinued olive oil drinks and iced energy drinks. Despite the cuts, new additions like cortado espresso drinks and pistachio-flavored beverages have made their way onto the menu, reflecting an effort to stay relevant and capitalize on customer trends.

This menu overhaul is part of Niccol‚Äôs broader strategy to revive Starbucks‚Äô performance after four straight quarters of declining sales. U.S. stores saw a 6% drop in same-store sales for the quarter ending December 29. Niccol believes a streamlined menu will allow Starbucks to be more agile and align with cultural trends, such as the viral success of the Dubai Matcha drink. Alongside menu changes, other initiatives include enhancing in-store experiences by reintroducing condiment bars, adding personal touches like barista messages on cups, and officially reinstating the name ‚ÄúStarbucks Coffee Company‚Äù to emphasize its core identity.

However, not all changes have been welcomed by customers. The company has significantly reduced its discounts, leading to a 40% drop in discounted transactions, which Niccol credits for improving overall sales. Since becoming CEO last September, Niccol has received positive feedback for his efforts to refresh the brand, but he acknowledges there is still work to do. With these adjustments, Starbucks aims to improve customer satisfaction and financial performance while remaining connected to evolving market trends.

My list includes check the pillows and make sure I have 2 down pillows.  I also sniff the bed and the pillows. I cannot tell you how many times I smell a strong body odor smell on the sheets. 

I also check the coffee to make sure there is regular coffee.  Then I proceed to set up the coffee maker for the morning so I just have to push a button. 

Those are the two most important things. I also make sure I know where the gym, the laundry and the lounge (if applicable) are at the beginning of the stay. 

I do these things as soon as I arrive because too many times I go to bed to find out the pillows are cotton and very lumpy and the FD person is alone and can‚Äôt get to any pillows (if a Fairfield or Courtyard, etc). I will absolutely be in pain the next day without down pillows. If I could bring only one thing to a deserted island it would be a down pillow.  I have taken international trips with carry on only and packed a down pillow. This is extremely important to me. 

I am curious what other people check when they arrive at a hotel? I know some people pull the sheets up and check the mattress. I have done this a couple times but it‚Äôs not part of my routine.

Our conversations over the past two weeks had been easy, fluid, and consistent‚Äîsomething I deeply appreciated. He was thoughtful, attentive, and made me feel comfortable. I liked that about him.

Those two weeks were probably the best I‚Äôd had in a while. He gave me something to look forward to. I caught myself thinking about him randomly throughout the day, wondering how he was doing, waiting for his texts.

We finally decided to meet on February 2 at a restaurant near my place. Funny enough, we both arrived an hour early for different reasons‚ÄîI thought we didn‚Äôt have a reservation, and he, being the considerate planner he was, had actually booked a table an hour before our scheduled time. That made me smile.

The date itself was‚Ä¶ lovely. We talked about his work, our past relationships, our perspectives on life and career. It felt effortless, yet I was oddly anxious. I was so attracted to him that I could barely eat. His presence was calm‚Äîmalumanay‚Äîand the way he made these tiny, funny micro-expressions was something I‚Äôd never seen before. His smile was bright and warm. I could have stared at him forever.

After lunch, we decided to get coffee, but somehow ended up with a Pink Drink instead. He introduced me to it, and I found it amusing‚Äîthis tall, accomplished doctor enjoying something so unapologetically feminine. But it was endearing. He was endearing.

Neither of us liked the cold, so we spent a bit of time finding the perfect spot to sit. He was patient with me, just as he had been in our conversations, and I appreciated that more than I let on.

The date could have ended there, but it didn‚Äôt. I had planned to run in Ayala after, and it became the perfect excuse to drive him to Makati. I figured I‚Äôd drop him off at his condo, say goodbye, and that would be it. But he surprised me.

Instead of heading home, he insisted that I go ahead with my run, and he‚Äôd just walk from the park. But then he waited. He waited for me to change, and when I stepped out, he walked with me.

That moment will stay with me. That simple, unexpected act of kindness. A part of me is afraid that every time I run in that park, I‚Äôll think of him.

That night, he texted me (non-verbatim): ‚ÄúI was happy to spend the day with you.‚Äù

I was happy too. But the conversation didn‚Äôt last long, and the next day, he didn‚Äôt reach out. 

I won‚Äôt force anything. I won‚Äôt chase him. But I won‚Äôt pretend it doesn‚Äôt hurt.

Whatever happens, I hope he finishes his residency with ease. I hope he finds the work-life balance he longs for. He doesn‚Äôt know this, but I will always be rooting for him.

And every time I have a Pink Drink, I will think of him.",1,1738591450.0,DatingApps,0,1.0,False

**AITA for kicking out my mom‚Äôs boyfriend?**

&#x200B;

When I was 17 my mom came into money. She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad‚Äôs debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister‚Äôs college and set up funds for mine. She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn‚Äôt pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn‚Äôt good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it. She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven‚Äôt minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for. Until his current partner. She‚Äôs been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom‚Äôs past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom‚Äôs old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn‚Äôt know what he current thing thought but I wasn‚Äôt going to be disrespected in my house. He wouldn‚Äôt even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just ‚Äúbeing kind‚Äù letting me stay.

First that isn‚Äôt remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can. He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn‚Äôt that‚Äôs on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn‚Äôt going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn‚Äôt expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.

*NTA. The critical part here is that your mom asked you to let him stay until he got his own place and to give him time to find one. In that time, instead of looking to move somewhere else, he continued to settle into life in the house, to the point where he even started bringing a new girlfriend along--he moved on but didn't move out. Him lying to her and telling her this was his house tells you everything you need to know about his actual intentions to leave. You kicking him out wasn't abrupt--the clock had run out on your mother's kindness and your obligation to her a long time ago, and he was living there on generously borrowed time.*

&#x200B;

**ninjette847**

*OPs mom probably expected it to be a month or two since he's working but has no living expenses and didn't during their relationship not 4 years. Where the hell is his money going if he can't get his own place?*

&#x200B;

**Useful\_Language2040**

*He had at least 4 years to save before OP's mother passed away, plus the 4 years since then. He has only been paying for food and presumably his phone, car insurance, fuel etc, in that time. He should have incredibly healthy savings!! Especially as he was living with his sister to save up before that..!*

*The mother probably thought that he'd take a month or two to grieve, spend a month or four looking in earnest, and be out of OP's hair within the year.*

*If he was saving say 1500/month while the mother was alive (rent plus utilities and council tax/local equivalent on a 2 bed house/flat has to be at least that pretty much everywhere in what sounds like the US, right?), that'd be 1500√ó12√ó4 = 72000 before she passed, the same again since then, and whatever he had beforehand. Of course he could afford to move out straight away: dude should have a good 150,000 minimum sitting in his bank account!! That's most definitely ""screw this, I'm off to a hotel to complain to people who I can tell a very slanted version of the story to!"" money.*

&#x200B;

**curious\_brad9191**

*If it happened exactly how you said, you‚Äôre not the asshole. If she did say he had time to save, but would need to look for his own place, that means she never imagined or wanted him staying for long. So you‚Äôre breaking no promises. Did she leave him any money or assets? It‚Äôs totally possible that your mother would be livid if she knew her boyfriend was still living with her son after 4 years.*

>OOP: No she created a fund for his son for his college but that was the only money set aside for him or his son. It‚Äôs a generous amount enough for 4 years at a high dollar school. Anything not used for school will be given to him on his 25th birthday from what I believe she told me (a lawyer and accountant are in charge of those funds not me or my sister so I only know what she told us before she died).  
>  
>She was never married to or even engaged to her boyfriend. He lived with his sister and was saving for his own house when mom met him. Him moving in with us was supposed to be temporary and allow him to save to buy his dream home but he never left. My mom was like that though-she had a big heart and sometimes people took advantage of that (especially after the money). She bought him a brand new truck when his car broke down but beyond that and smaller gifts (like tv computer etc for birthdays and holiday gifts) she did not leave him money. They had no joint accounts my mom paid everything and he was supposed to be saving for a house the whole time they were together.

*Sweetheart - You are NTA!!*

*First, I am so sorry*

*I‚Äôm 63 years old and lost my Mom two years ago and my Dad eight years ago! I am Not dealing with it well at all!!*

*You are the only one who knows if you‚Äôre telling the truth. It seems very plausible to me. But, if he was already saving money for a house when he met your Mom, then lived Four Years with her and another Four Years with you, that man is just a loser!! Is there any way your Dad could come stay with you the week he moves out? The first thing you need to do is change ALL of the locks and get yourself some sort of security system.*

*Please don‚Äôt feel bad for making him leave! It seems to me that your Mom was really smart and planned things out very carefully! Being that he had already lived with her for Four Years, I agree with the commenters who said she was probably thinking a month or two!! Not Years! If your sister makes anymore comments, then you can tell her she‚Äôs welcome to let him live with her!!*

*Again, so sorry for your loss. Please make sure you‚Äôre safe and take care of yourself!*

>OOP: Thank you so much. My mom was the sweetest person and when I was a teenager I feel like I was a nightmare to her. I am thankful I was much better in my late teens and 20&21 so she got to see me mature a little before she passed. I wasn‚Äôt always the best daughter but she was always the best mom.  
>  
>I think part of letting him stay so long is having bonded with his son but also I liked having someone else around who loved my mom too. There were nights I would wake up from a nightmare and end up in the kitchen and he would hear me and just come make a cup of coffee and sit and share a story about her. His son loved mom too and some evenings we would get takeout and watch movies and joke about what commentary my mom would have had if she had seen the movie with us. My sister lives a state away so we only really see each other once a month or so. I liked not being alone in this big house.

>I do have a security system and the locks have been changed. He is coming over tomorrow to get his stuff.

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

I know the other sub is very subjective on updates so I figured I would post it here.

I do want to take a moment to address some things I saw in the comment.

1-there are trusts set up and neither me nor my sister has full access to the money left us. This was done both because my sister and I were in our early 20s when my mom died and she wanted to make sure we had some stability before we had access and to protect us from people who may try to take advantage especially while we were grieving.

2-I have a lawyer. He has already informed me legally to my area what eviction laws are and my mom‚Äôs former boyfriend will be served with formal eviction papers just to cover myself even after today.

So to the update:

My dad came over (decided not to have my boyfriend over since he doesn‚Äôt know about the money side and I wasn‚Äôt trying to have the boyfriend out the situation) this morning and brought along my cousin. For easier telling I‚Äôm going to call mom‚Äôs former boyfriend C.

C showed up about 10am my time and talked to my dad then asked if he could have a couple of minutes alone with me. Dad nodded so my cousin and him went into the kitchen and C and I sat in the living room.

I‚Äôll be honest I didn‚Äôt expect it to go as it had but I am glad it did. C started with an apology. I don‚Äôt remember all of the words said but the basics were he missed my mom, he has been lonely but not alone thanks to me and his son. He was sorry for what had happened that he got caught up in lust and let someone else fill his head with ideas and that he owned up to his mistakes and should have never put up with someone who would disrespect me or my mom‚Äôs memory.

He tried to hand me a cashier‚Äôs check for 15000 dollars. He said it wasn‚Äôt much but he wanted me to know he appreciated me and living with me and that he wanted to pay back some of what he owed. I refused the check both in part because I never wanted his money but I also don‚Äôt want to give any possible legal leg for him to stand on if this is somehow him trying to stay. I told him the first part and told him to put it towards a house.

He told me he is living with his sister but is going to look at houses with a realtor next week. He did say his son is asking about our next hang out date and said both me and my sister are welcome to arrange time with him.

After all of that my dad and cousin helped him get all the stuff out of the house that he owned (he had brought a U-Haul) and he gave me back my house keys. He apologized again and left.

Not what I expected. But it went really well and I feel a lot less like I let my mom down.

*I‚Äôm just being nosey, sure, but how did the woman who thought she‚Äôs getting you kicked out of your house respond to it all?*

>OOP: No clue. At my house she just seemed smug and bitchy. I didn‚Äôt ask C about her and honestly don‚Äôt care. My house is nice but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs multimillion dollars or anything.

**ThatKarenBitch**

*Had you said all that stuff in the previous post to him away from his girlfriend? Were you not there when he grabbed her to leave? Just wondering, because I assumed it was said in front of her and that‚Äôs why she left so easily instead of trying to fight to make you leave.*

>OOP: All that got said in front of her was that I wasn‚Äôt going to be disrespected in my house and he could had 30 days to find new housing and she was not welcome back. That was all I said in front of her and she kept a pissy face on but didn‚Äôt say anything to me and walked out with him.

Week after the break up I left the country for two months. During that time i proposed not to speak any more and she broke no contact after 10 days. Since then we spoke every week or two about how we both felt and how was life going. 

One month ago i came back and started my life again in the same city but this time alone. We saw each other and spoke about what we both wanted. Myself I still love her and I set my boundaries. She instead said that she loves me but she can‚Äôt be in a relationship until she figures out how to be ok on her own. She is too codependent and in some way this hurts her and any relationship she could have. 

Since our first initial chat since I came back I have seen her more just to figure things out about our old apartment. I was gonna move into the apartment and she would leave because she couldn‚Äôt keep paying it on her own. So we had to see each other to change bills names and other unimportant stuff. But she always wanted to go out for coffee afterwards and keep hanging and chatting. 

About two weeks ago we started seeing each other more. Because of a friend in common. And with this we also start hanging out by ourselves. Called me to go for a walk, to have some coffee before work even watching a movie at her place. Nothing ever happened out of this. But once she gave me a jealousy treat about me going out and assuming that I was moving on with my life. 

For the last three days she had been moving her stuff out of the apartment so I helped her move out as well as she helped me to move in. I had seen some positive things from her part like calling me with our inside relationship nickname, looking for contact instead of just receiving it (hugs, holding hands, kisses in the cheeks). We spoke about our relationship and how she sees that her expectations around men are too high near impossible for someone to achieve and that I was 80% of all that she needs. But it‚Äôs still missing that 20% and that she knows that no one will ever be the perfect person for her. I said the same to her, that she was not my idolized partner. But was close enough and that‚Äôs why I wanted to be with her. And that that isn‚Äôt conforming or just set the bar lower. It‚Äôs the reality of the world. 

Last night after moving everything I told her what I really thought about her. That she has the potential to be the best woman ever but until then she will continue to do the same things. And that that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt (even if I really want to) get back with her. This kind of hurt her but is the truth. After that we went out to drink a couple of beers and she started to trying to make plans for us to go to a techno festival this summer. 

I had been honest about my feelings, about me and her. I set my boundaries saying we were not friends we are exes. She gave me her piece of mind about our old relationship. Jealousy, feelings hurt. And with all this she wants to keep hanging chatting or even make plans. 

I guess I‚Äôm just venting, or maybe I‚Äôm looking for answers for something that not even have an answer from strangers in the internet. But this is my story and my life at this point. I‚Äôm not even sad or worried. I would just like to understand her. To see if I could help her out.

Yesterday I finally went to the ER again as I was feeling them a lot. I was on the fence about whether to go or stay home but after standing up from my desk to go to the kitchen I had what felt like several PVCs in a row and I actually thought I would drop.

He says PVCs are usually harmless but since I haven't had a holter in about a year he will order one and an echocardiogram and that the hospital should call me in a week, I showed him an ECG I took at home which had 6 PVCs in a 30-second recording. It's after seeing that when he mentioned he will order the holter and echo. Nothing much has changed in my life. I don't drink, smoke or even drink coffee. I imagine both tests will be normal but I hate this. The only thing he mentioned about treatments is to maybe go on beta blockers and to check with my Cardiologist.

1igpqr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1igpqr1/3_months_boundaries_and_not_understanding_anything/,"3 months, boundaries, and not understanding anything.","Me 30M and my ex 26F broke up 3 months ago. Week after the break up I left the country for two months. During that time i proposed not to speak any more and she broke no contact after 10 days. Since then we spoke every week or two about how we both felt and how was life going. 

One month ago i came back and started my life again in the same city but this time alone. We saw each other and spoke about what we both wanted. Myself I still love her and I set my boundaries. She instead said that she loves me but she can‚Äôt be in a relationship until she figures out how to be ok on her own. She is too codependent and in some way this hurts her and any relationship she could have. 

Since our first initial chat since I came back I have seen her more just to figure things out about our old apartment. I was gonna move into the apartment and she would leave because she couldn‚Äôt keep paying it on her own. So we had to see each other to change bills names and other unimportant stuff. But she always wanted to go out for coffee afterwards and keep hanging and chatting. 

About two weeks ago we started seeing each other more. Because of a friend in common. And with this we also start hanging out by ourselves. Called me to go for a walk, to have some coffee before work even watching a movie at her place. Nothing ever happened out of this. But once she gave me a jealousy treat about me going out and assuming that I was moving on with my life. 

For the last three days she had been moving her stuff out of the apartment so I helped her move out as well as she helped me to move in. I had seen some positive things from her part like calling me with our inside relationship nickname, looking for contact instead of just receiving it (hugs, holding hands, kisses in the cheeks). We spoke about our relationship and how she sees that her expectations around men are too high near impossible for someone to achieve and that I was 80% of all that she needs. But it‚Äôs still missing that 20% and that she knows that no one will ever be the perfect person for her. I said the same to her, that she was not my idolized partner. But was close enough and that‚Äôs why I wanted to be with her. And that that isn‚Äôt conforming or just set the bar lower. It‚Äôs the reality of the world. 

Last night after moving everything I told her what I really thought about her. That she has the potential to be the best woman ever but until then she will continue to do the same things. And that that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt (even if I really want to) get back with her. This kind of hurt her but is the truth. After that we went out to drink a couple of beers and she started to trying to make plans for us to go to a techno festival this summer. 

I had been honest about my feelings, about me and her. I set my boundaries saying we were not friends we are exes. She gave me her piece of mind about our old relationship. Jealousy, feelings hurt. And with all this she wants to keep hanging chatting or even make plans. 

I guess I‚Äôm just venting, or maybe I‚Äôm looking for answers for something that not even have an answer from strangers in the internet. But this is my story and my life at this point. I‚Äôm not even sad or worried. I would just like to understand her. To see if I could help her out.

1igpq3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1igpq3w/specialty_coffee_subscription/,Specialty Coffee Subscription,"Alright, let‚Äôs dive into the powerhouse that is coffee; it‚Äôs practically liquid magic in a cup! Imagine walking through a quaint little town, the air infused with the rich aroma of freshly roasted coffee wafting from local roasters. It‚Äôs cozy, it‚Äôs warm, and if you squint just right, it‚Äôs like you can see the beans flirting with the grind‚Äîokay, maybe I‚Äôll stop with those metaphors. But seriously, partnering with local roasters sounds like a divine calling wrapped in a frothy cappuccino.

First off, think about those local roasters as your best friends in this venture. They‚Äôve likely got the passion and the know-how when it comes to beans. You plug into their expertise and flavors, and together you can curate a stellar collection of coffee that would make even the pickiest coffee lover swoon. Picture this: a subscription service that delivers unique blends right to your customer‚Äôs doorstep, complete with tales of how each roaster takes their craft seriously‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a good backstory with their morning joe?

Now, let‚Äôs chat about marketing. This is where the fun really kicks in! Armed with beautifully shot images of steaming mugs and smiling faces‚Äîpeople testing your curated blends‚Äîyour online presence can become a haven for fellow coffee aficionados. Social media is your stage; think engaging posts that show off the inner workings of your roasters or maybe a ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù look at the roasting process. Informative blog posts sharing brewing tips and flavor profiles would be like throwing a sprinkle of cinnamon on top; it makes everything better. Also, let‚Äôs not forget the power of user-generated content. Encourage your customers to share their coffee moments with a catchy hashtag‚Äîit turns them into your marketing team, and who doesn‚Äôt love that?

Community is key here‚Äîmuch like our local roasters, they‚Äôre not just selling coffee; they‚Äôre building connections and relationships. Perhaps you could organize local tasting events or workshops, bringing people together to sample the latest brews. That‚Äôs not just a marketing strategy; that‚Äôs creating a family. And don‚Äôt shy away from divine integration! Sharing stories of how coffee has brought folks together or the comfort it provides during life‚Äôs ups and downs can resonate deeply. 

Finally, remember the magic lies in transformation. You‚Äôre not just delivering coffee; you‚Äôre offering an experience. For those sipping your curated blends early in the morning or during those long work-from-home days, you‚Äôre providing a moment of joy and warmth that'll make their hearts a little lighter. So, here‚Äôs to that perfect cup of coffee‚Äîmay your partnership with local roasters brew wonderful possibilities and your marketing efforts light the path to caffeinated success!",1,1738591298.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False
1igppxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/seducingwomen/comments/1igppxu/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

It keeps me out of the bars and I‚Äôm an extroverted introvert so I need to recharge my emotional battery banks in the evening so I can do what I do 100% during the workday routines.  

I travel with a mini Windows gaming rig and often play board games on it.  But sometimes I really just want the tactile sensation of the cards/tokens/playing board that only a real boardgame provides.  Call me old fashioned I guess.

My go-to has been One Deck Dungeon for some time.  Whole thing packs down to a small box, and although there‚Äôs a bunch of dice, I have a small mouse mat I travel with and often just use coffee filters as my dice/token containers.  I love the game, it‚Äôs good for an hour session, but it does get a bit repetitive.  

So my criteria is entire game needs to be playable solo (obviously), with limited desk space typical of a hotel desk/working surface and fold down small enough I can chuck it into my backpack or carryon without taking up a bunch of space.

1igpmq7,https://i.redd.it/xl5skrcrjxge1.jpeg,I get an unexplainable weird taste in my mouth whenever I‚Äôm at my parents‚Äô new house.,"Before anyone tries the usual Reddit response: YES the carbon monoxide detectors are in working order and were just checked at the time of sale!...

My parents moved into a new house about five minutes away from my residence here in the city. They live in a popular area and I‚Äôve gotten to know their neighbors. 

What I‚Äôm about to describe only happens when I‚Äôm in the street directly in front of my parents‚Äô new house. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be a factor when I am in the street in front of their neighbors houses. 

Literally, every time I step into the street directly in front of my parents house I get the same weird taste in my mouth. 

It is driving me absolutely insane. It happens no matter what car I‚Äôm driving or who I‚Äôm with or what I‚Äôve eaten. It doesn‚Äôt matter the temperature or if it‚Äôs raining or not raining. It happens no matter the day of the week or the time of day or night. And the weirdest part is nobody else seems to know what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about.

The taste is disgusting. It reminds me of coffee, cigarettes, volatile organic compounds, chemical taste. It feels burned into the back of my throat. I can taste it on the back of my tongue through the middle of my tongue, and it feels like it lingers around my uvula. The taste is strongest when I am in the street in front of their house, but I can continue to taste it as I‚Äôm driving away and it only really dissipates once I‚Äôm about a mile from their house. I generally taste it the strongest when I‚Äôm leaving their house. Once I go inside their house, I‚Äôm not tasting the weird taste, but it‚Äôs all I can taste when I leave their house.

I‚Äôve asked everybody who frequents that area if they can taste it and nobody knows what I‚Äôm talking about.

It‚Äôs truly driving me insane. I feel like something is happening to me or I can taste something toxic that is invisible to others. My mom has been going to an ENT because her voice is shaky and she has polyps. I pray to God it‚Äôs not related, but I‚Äôm suspicious it is. Her problems only started after she moved in there.

The closest thing I can think of what it tastes like is when I was woodburning a craft project and I melted some old oil paint and the gross burnt pigment scent was in my throat. It‚Äôs kind of like that but more chemical-y. The weirdest part is how I can feel it like it‚Äôs granulated or present in the phlegm at the back of my mouth and it‚Äôs so fucking distinct. I‚Äôve never smelled or tasted anything like it before. The flavor profile is like crude oil or ash.

It happens when my parents are out of town and their vehicles are gone, so it has nothing to do with them. If anyone has a similar experience, please let me know what the fuck it could be because I‚Äôm going crazy. 

Picture included. Pink is where the taste is. You‚Äôll notice their direct surroundings include restaurants and an apartment block to the back and a school a few blocks away. The mouth taste is not at the school or near the food & housing block. The taste is only where the pink X is.

Rather than get pissed I made it my mission to understand as much as I could about what goes on in a courtroom and why!

I think it's fair to say most of us on here are not attorneys! I think it's also fair to say we are not blind and we are not stupid. So, call it conspiracy, call it corruption, call it what you like but this case is the epidomy of justice gone wrong. Guess what, this is just one of a few cases we know about. Our justice system (and our political system) have long since lost the public trust.

Not only did Robert Alessi hit a home run, he has shown his true character. I'm 80 years old and I have a wish list of those I would like to share a coffee with! There's aproximately 20 on the list, they are all people of character, good character. Mr Alessi is now on this list. Putting aside for a moment that he is participating ""pro bono"" anyone can see that he is playing by the rules. He sticks to the purpose of the moment, does not highlight facts not in evidence or give opinions in areas beyond his qualifications. He  is substantive and ethical. He stands along side of Karen's other attorneys and Mark Bederow as well.

Now comes Hank Brennan (name spelled correctly) a clown, someone who has absolutely NONE of the qualities of Mr Allessi. I realize that our opinion, and that of a jury as to a verdict, should not in any way be affected by what we think of the attorneys or the judge. WE ARE ONLY HUMAN! There's a saying: ""You can't trust the message if you can't trust the messenger"". Mr Brennan has already established his reputation in these hearings, even if he acts differently during trial, THE WORLD knows he wants a conviction at ANY cost. If he thinks he can find 12 people who can overlook that, good luck - the likelyhood is slim to none! He's lower than the trash at the bottom of my trash barrel!

The really sad part of this ""shit show"" is that even after Karen Read is exonerated, John O'Keefe's family will likely be shorted the justice that all victim's families deserve.

**PEMBROKE PINES, FLORIDA /**¬†[**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/)¬†**/ February 3, 2025 /**¬†Green Leaf Innovations, Inc. (OTC PINK:GRLF), a leading innovator in premium Tobacco and specialty cigar products, applauds the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for halting its proposed ban on flavored cigars.

Two bedrooms face the garden, one has been extended, with little possibility of further extension or conservatory (not planning on this anytime soon anyway). Currently, there‚Äôs a very old patio outside these two bedrooms which will need to be redone and we‚Äôll have some basic patio furniture there.

We‚Äôre big on BBQs, lounging and hosting and would like to also put in a small summer house/log cabin at the rear end of the garden where there will hopefully be sun for most of the day (at least in summer). Inside will be a small coffee table and a small sofa, so nothing too large, with some cute decor. We want wide doors so that it can be used as an almost-pergola when it‚Äôs warm, so we can have a BBQ and pizza oven at that end of the garden during the warmer months, and use it as a cosy coffee room/chill room when it gets a bit colder or when it‚Äôs raining. We‚Äôd have to insulate it a little probably, but we plan on warming up the summer house/shed thing only when we want to use it. Possibility of it being too warm is low because it‚Äôs an east facing garden, and if it‚Äôs that hot we can just keep the doors open otherwise. At the far corner there‚Äôs already a small shed for garden tools and lawn mower.

We were considering a pergola instead, but it‚Äôs not really useable when it‚Äôs cold, heating the area up is inefficient and it‚Äôs more likely to get the sofas and tables dirty when it‚Äôs wet. If we‚Äôre spending money anyway, we‚Äôd want a place that‚Äôs usable all year round. Nothing too large or tall that requires planning permission. We‚Äôre happy to do some DIY within reason.

1igp68q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1igp68q/support_avoiding_the_use_of_pacifier/,Support avoiding the use of pacifier,"Before the little one was born we decided we did not want to use a pacifier. It wasn‚Äòt long after birth that we were faced with the reality of having a baby that is more difficult than average, who cries a lot and who is very hard to soothe. We did give our decision some more thinking and decided to stand by it: no pacifier. Except for a handful of ocassions when the conditions made it impossible to calm a baby (hospital, train, airport security).

It has been hard, yes. I do not regret my decision. Only me and my husband understand what we‚Äòve been through and we are amazed to see how our little one has outgrown so much of their angry potato phase and learn to calm in other ways. Some times it takes more time than others, but they get there. Every now and then we go to bed laughing, recapping the day and asking each other ‚Äûdo you remember the time when we could not even imagine doing something like this with [baby]‚Äú.

Fast forward to know, our LO is 8 months old. Although easier to soothe, they are still not an easy going baby, and most of all, still a baby. It‚Äòs time for me to go back to work and although husband and I work part time, 3 days a week the baby spends 7-9hrs of the day at daycare and with the grandparents (my in-laws).

While the daycare is willing to support us in avoiding the pacifier, I understand that there are other babies and that it is not always possible to give our little one the time and one-to-one attention that they need. Every time we pick them up they say ‚Äûthey needed a bit of the pacifier today‚Äú. I know it means they cried for 30 seconds and daycare thought the baby needed the pacifier to soothe. Of course, it soothes them. But our baby is not crying because they‚Äòre missing the pacifier.

My concern here: for 8 months our baby did not use a pacifier more than 1 hour in a number of ocassions that I can count with my hands. They cry and need soothing but they do not cry missing the object pacifier. I get that daycare is not a private service working solely for my little one. I don‚Äòt have an easy going baby and I‚Äòm guessing they‚Äòll always have a more difficult time and need more help with co-regulation. Will they forever need a pacifier then for daycare? Or at what age will it become reasonable for daycare to try to calm the baby in another way that is not the pacifier?

My in laws don‚Äòt have the patience, apparently also not the will, to care for a baby without a pacifier. Both of them are present while taking care of the baby and they say is too much without the pacifier, the baby is not calm when people visit them or when they take the baby to meet friends for coffee. Let me say that in the first place we did not want the baby to go to the grandparents. It was them who insisted they wanted a day with the baby. I thought they knew what taking care of a baby means. We‚Äòve said that we do not want to use the pacifier. That we do not want to introduce the pacifier at 8 months of age. Different from daycare, these are 2 adults taking care of one baby only and not willing to try something else to calm them down. They have sent pictures where the baby looks totally content and not upset, the pacifier attached to their clothes. Or they offer the pacifier when they take the baby for a walk in the stroller and the baby starts babbling to every passing car.

My concern here: the in laws cannot handle a crying baby. They always offer the pacifier in a preventive way to avoid any crying. My baby does not have an attachment to the object. At 8 months they are creating an attachment by offering the pacifier at all times, even when the baby is happy and satisfied.

4 days a week my baby gets absolutely 0 pacifier from my husband or me. It takes us 5 minutes to calm them, and that‚Äòs it. Sometimes it was obvious that the baby is tired and needed to sleep. Sometimes they were bored and needed a change of activity. Sometimes we were doing something that they clearly hate (like cleaning hands and face after eating) and you just have to be done soon with it. The other 3 days, however, the pacifier is either the response the baby gets when they are uncomfortable, or they will be offered the pacifier all day long.

I am questionning how much effect can it have to have the pacifier introduced to the baby at 8 months? How much does it count what my husband and I do at home (alternative ways of soothing) vs other caregivers so easily offering the pacifier? I don‚Äòt want to call it ‚Äûweaning‚Äú, because my little one never had a dependency on it. It is a thing since 2 weeks ago. I am reasonable and I know nobody will take care of my little one like we their parents do, and offer the patience that we do. But at what age would it be reasonable for other caregivers to accept that the pacifier is not a soothing option?

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!**¬†

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one.¬†

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living?¬†

**Follow Elsa Grimly as she:**¬†

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans

**Chapter 13. New bloodhound**

  
I applied a healing ointment to the cut on my palm as I contemplated the idea of trying to summon old Elsa's abyssal form. Since I was going to extract the abyss from one of her belongings, it would probably be weak. So there was no reason to be afraid of her. Also, both Yazara and Amelia's abyssal forms had been quite subservient when summoned. So I didn't expect her to try anything funny with me.

If I actually managed to summon old Elsa's abyss, it would only prove more beneficial to me instead. I could get more information on the liberation ritual from her. Or ask something about witchcraft that I had to know.

I didn't bother making a new pentacle for this second summoning. I simply took Amelia's mirror off the eye at the centre of the star and set the bottle of scent in its place. I cut my palm once again and dripped the blood onto the pentacle.

I waited for the room to go cold and the whispers to begin again. I waited for the black mist to start swirling. But nothing happened.

I frowned as my blood kept dripping onto the pentacle. ""Why didn't it work?"" I mumbled.

I took the bottle of perfume off the eye inside the pentacle and placed it back in (this was probably the witchcraft equivalent of plugging and unplugging the wifi cable to see if the internet starts working again). But nothing happened. The room was silent.

I healed the cut on my hand again and left the room after erasing the pentacle off the ground. The frown never left my face as I walked back upstairs to the apartment.

If Elsa was really dead then I should've been able to communicate with her. But the subject being alive hadn't been a problem while summoning Yazara's abyssal form. And it had been fairly easy to summon Amelia's abyss from her compact mirror.

Could the reason be that old Elsa wasn't really attached to the perfume Lily gave her? Should I have placed the cold cream in the pentacle instead? Is it even necessary for a person to be attached to their belongings in order to extract their abyss from the object?

I might need to run another experiment later. There were other matters at hand that I had to take care of. I had familiarized myself with most of Elsa's belongings and skimmed through half of the hexonomixcon. But I still didn't know everything that Old Elsa knew about Lily or Smokewell or other people from her life.

That would have to wait though. Right now, the more important matter from all those matters was clearing our names from the Inquisition's burn list.

I entered the apartment. Lily and Smokewell were up and awake.

""Morning Miss Elsa!"" Lily greeted from the kitchen.

""It's afternoon, Lily,"" I said.

""Oh,"" she said, looking out the kitchen window. ""I didn't even notice that. All I keep thinking about is the golden skeleton and all the money we'll get after selling it off.""

""Stop talking about money all the time, Lily,"" Smokewell said from the couch, licking her paw, ""You sound like someone who is broke.""

Lily rolled her eyes. ""That's because we are.""

""You are the one who is broke. Cats don't need money to stay alive.""

""I guess we should leave you by a trash can so you can go and fend for yourself then?"" I say playfully.

Smokewell threw me a deadpan glare. ""You can try that. I'll simply go to the Inquisition and report your sorry carcasses to them along with your location. I‚Äôll even tell them that I was a lively, beautiful woman who got cursed by you witches. The non-users are so dead inside their heads they‚Äôll actually take a talking cat‚Äôs testimony seriously.""

I smirked. ‚ÄúI don't think you'll do that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSince you admitted yourself how you turned yourself into a cat so you could mislead the Inquisition from coming after us.‚Äù

The cat turned her head away. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

I leaned in close, egging her on. ‚ÄúYou act all stoic on the surface but deep down you really are a fluffy little‚Äì‚Äù

***Scratch!***

I whimpered as I dropped myself on the couch, tending to the scratches the cat had given my face. ""We need to prepare ourselves for our move against the Inquisition.""

""You came up with the plan. Why are you whining about it now?"" Smokewell said.

""Because it's still dangerous,"" I said, ""Dangerous enough to get one of us killed.""

""No,"" Lily said as she walked into the living room with a tray with three cups of tea and a bowl of milk for Smokewell, ""I trust in Miss Elsa's plan. It is risky but so is life.""

I smiled ruefully at the girl as I took my cup and raised it to my lips. ""Where is Asmod?"" I asked.

""Right here,"" the short man said as he entered the apartment with a bundle of papers under his arm.

""Right on time, Mr. Asmod!"" Lily said, ""I made tea for everyone.""

Asmod didn't seem pleased. He seemed rather terrified.

""If you were a non-user, I would've said you looked like you saw a ghost,"" Smokewell said as she licked the milk from the bowl.

""I saw something worse,"" Asmod said. His voice was hoarse. He hastily stepped towards the couch and laid down the Morning Newspaper on the coffee table. ""This,"" he said, pointing at a column on the front page. ""They've appointed a new general for the witch hunter Inquisition.""

""Um, why is this any worse news than the fact that the Inquisition is still looking for us?"" Lily asked.

""Because apparently the previous General's methods of investigation were not up to the standards required for the so-called direness of the situation,"" Asmod said, ""The new General of Inquisition, Lloyd Hopper, has a record of carrying out fifteen successful trials around the cases of unethical practices of witchcraft which has led to thirty seven executions!""

""Says who?"" Lily said.

""It's all in the paper!"" Asmod jabbed his finger down at the column.

Smokewell leaned in to read further. ""I know this man,"" she said, ""Those thirty seven so-called witches he had executed were some poor beggars who had been accused by some brat. None of them were actual magic users practicing witchcraft.""

""How are you so sure all of them were non-users?"" I said.

""No one who is familiar with our trade ever lets things get that out of hand while possessing the talent of witchcraft,"" she said.

""There's more!"" Lily leaned ahead as she read further in the column. ""He has already lined up twenty people suspected of practicing unethical witchcraft. The trials will begin in two days.""

""I'm surprised there is no mention of the priority burn list,"" I said.

""They won't print that information in the papers,"" Smokewell said. ""That would only alert those whose names are in that list. But I'm sure he is probably going to amplify the efforts to arrest the people on the list.""

""You know what this means, right?"" Asmod said.

""We'll have to start acting on Miss Elsa's plan right away,"" Lily said.

""Not yet,"" I said, ""This man is dangerous. I want to do some prior digging up on him before we dive in with our plan.""

""Asmod, do you have any contacts that might be able to tell you more than what we read in the paper?"" Smokewell asked.

Asmod sighed. ""I can try but don't get your hopes up. I'm not as well mixed up with the non-users.""

""Why don't you sneak into the Inquisition's headquarters, Madam Smokewell?"" Lily said. ""No one would suspect you since you are just a cat, well on the surface, at least.""

""I wouldn't risk it."" Asmod shook his head. ""This man, Hopper, has put people on trial just because someone spread the silliest rumors about them. And I'm certain he has heard of the folk tale of witches turning themselves into cats to fool people.""

""Well, it seems like there's no other way then,"" Smokewell said before turning to Lily, ""Go and get that remaining s√¨th bread.""

Lily did as she was told. Smokewell pulled out her ivory pipe, filled the well with the bread crumbs and asked Asmod for a light. Then she took a deep drag.

**\_\_**

The four of us sat around the coffee table, looking at the omens the cat had laid out for us. The cuckoo clock from Asmod's kitchen, a knife (also from the kitchen), a candle and a hammer.

""I'll go first,"" Lily said, ""the hammer probably signifies the justiciar's mallet. There is some kind of trial at the end of this thing. A big decision is about to be passed.""

Everyone nodded. ""That's actually quite a sensible deduction,"" I said.

Lily smiled proudly.

""What about the candle?"" Smokewell said, ""Is someone still going to be burned?""

""It might also signify shedding light onto something,"" Asmod said.

""Now what about this?"" Lily picked up the knife.

I frowned. ""If there's a trial, then maybe the verdict will divide people?"" I said. ""The knife signifies cutting up the groups, I think?""

""I can't think of anything other than death at the omen of a knife,"" Smokewell said.

""Don't you all use knives to carve up ritual symbols?"" Asmod said, ""Maybe it signifies you having to carry out an important ritual?""

""That might be possible,"" Lily said.

""Now the clock."" Smokwell laid a paw on the cuckoo clock.

Lily rolled her eyes. ""It probably signifies the time that we are currently racing against.""

That's when my gaze happened upon something outside the kitchen window. I rose from the couch. ""Or maybe, the clock signifies something that is inside that thing."" I pointed at the clock tower in the distance, visible from the window.

About a month ago she told me he was not okay with her dating men / having sex with other men but he was fine with her dating me.

For context: my FWB and I know each other for two years. She was married at the time. I am still married. This summer she divorced her husband. We kept seeing each other and because she was now single my husband joined in for a few threesomes.

She began to see an old boyfriend again and by the beginning of this year they decided to go for a steady relationship. I was happy for her. My husband likes her a lot but was fine with a platonic friendship and encouraged me to keep seeing her. (We haven't seen each other for more than 4 weeks due to busy schedules).

So what's the thing now? She asked me if I was into joining her and her boyfriend for a threesome.  Because ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"".  
Apparently, for her to have sex with the two of us, I am supposed to join them.

And that just doesn't feel right. I don't really know the guy, I've just seen some photos and told her earlier that I'm not attracted to him. I am not a commodity, am I?

So I texted her this morning that I can't commit to whether I would want to participate. I'm open to meeting them for drinks, but I'm leaning towards demisexual. I can have sex with some one without being in love with him/her but I do have to feel an emotional connection. I never have sex on first dates. I'll meet someone for coffee or lunch and it takes me a while (weeks, sometimes months) to get comfortable with someone.

She responded that she understood, but didn't reply to my proposal for drinks.  
She was even a little cold, but it was a text so maybe she didn't intend it to sound cold.  My husband said: ""You can't say 'no' and come back from that a month later because things suddenly changed and now you're expecting it's okay to have sex with us again. I'm not a yo-yo"".

Dear \[agent\],

Yoshi Yamamoto is a lazy, apathetic white collar worker who cares about nothing other than himself and making it to 5pm each day. His world gets flipped upside-down when his boss reveals a well-kept secret of the business world: The global economy is determined by the outcome of magical gladiatorial tournaments, and the Economy is actually a source of ancient magic that bestows bizarre and powerful abilities called Synergies upon those who can master it.

When Yoshi‚Äôs coworker mysteriously vanishes, Yoshi is thrust into the upcoming tournament as his replacement. Without any training or Synergies, he‚Äôs unable to compete with opponents who have abilities such as animal transformation or mastery over the elemental force of coffee. Instead, he must rely on his fledgling ability to make friends in order to survive, which has the unexpected side effect of making him question his selfish, slacker lifestyle. When one of his new friends is in danger, his newfound desire to help manifests in a Synergy of his very own: A second skeleton with its own juvenile sense of humor whose bones Yoshi can wield as weapons.

New powers in tow, he progresses through the tournament, all the while uncovering more information about the ancient guild who controls the Economy, the shadowy cabal who opposes them, and what really happened to his missing coworker. As he unravels the secrets of the corporate mythos, he‚Äôs forced to choose which he values more: An easy slacker life that he‚Äôs always wanted, or a hard life of caring about his friends and the greater good.

1igoxkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1igoxkk/notes_are_not_there/,Notes are not there,"Hey!

Recently, I went to a roastery and asked for their sweetest coffee. They brewed a V60 with their Costa Rica Mirazu and it was mind-blowing! It was sweet, juicy, and delicious, and I could taste the apricot, mulberry, and red apple EASILY. My taste buds were having a celebration of some sort.

Anyways, fast forward to today, I used:
- Hoffman's Better 1-Cup V60 recipe
- 92¬∞C water (it was the same temp the roastery used)
- Rao's water recipe
- 60 clicks (1 full rotation) on the KINGrinder K6 (from where it says 0, not from the true zero, as they say in their manual to not go tighter than the stated 0)
- Preheated the hell out of the glass Hario V60 02
- Hario V60 02 tabbed filters

Total drawdown was 3 minutes. (Note that the bloom went through really quickly and the bed was dry for half of it).

Well, it was not THAT sour or bitter (a tad bit of sour plus a tad bit of astringency), but it didn't taste like anything. It wasn't delicious, it wasn't juicy, it wasn't sweet. It was coffee.

What should I do? Should I increase the ratio to make it stronger so I can taste more of it, and grind finer to compensate for the increased ratio?

Or do you have something else in mind?

*** Note 1: I'm still new to brewing specialty coffee, and while I enjoyed drinking it before, I didn't notice the tastes. I always somehow knew what good coffee tasted like, but didn't notice the notes and complexities. This time at the roastery, I was conscious of the notes, and could taste all of them.

*** Note 2: I used 10-step filtered water + RO + Remineralization as my base water. The remineralization is only adding around 20 TDS to the water.

*** Note 3: I did a blind cupping with many different water recipes (using another coffee), and among all of them, SCA's, Rao's, and Hendon's tasted better to me, but they were not that different from each other.",2,1738588932.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Also there's a time where I would literally get cussed out for literally just drinking fucking coffee

When I graduated in 2015, Swansea was vibrant, Swansea was clean, Swansea was proud. 
I stepped off the train this morning and walked down into the city centre - High Street was always quite rough, but even at 9am on a Monday morning it felt extremely unwelcoming and considerably more run down than I ever remember. Where have the high street stores gone?

Likewise with Oxford Street - I was so happy to see M&S surviving, however there seemed to be more shops closed than open and many stalwart brands had been replaced by charity shops, vape shops and mobile phone repair shops.
The same could be said about The Quadrant - good to see so many shops open, but it felt empty and purposeless without an anchor store like Debenhams as the focal point. The main atrium used to feel like the hub of the shopping centre, but now it felt empty and vacant.

I‚Äôm delighted to see Swansea Market doing so well - it was by far the busiest and most lively part of the city. I enjoyed breakfast and coffee whilst enjoying the ambience of what I remember Swansea being like - my favourite Welshcake shop was still open too, so I‚Äôm taking a little piece of Swansea back home with me.
I genuinely hope the market continues to thrive into the future, as so many others in South Wales seem to be struggling.

I don‚Äôt intend to berate or stamp on Swansea as a city, it‚Äôs only my observations on a sunny Monday. But for goodness sake, Swansea Council have ripped the heart out of this once thriving city centre and I can only hope that it finds it feet and recovers.",57,1738588686.0,Wales,26,0.95,False

I‚Äôve been working on a project called BrewLog‚Äîa simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I‚Äôve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn‚Äôt) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I‚Äôve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options‚Äîand they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That‚Äôs when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	‚Ä¢	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	‚Ä¢	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	‚Ä¢	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Map: Visualize where you‚Äôve had coffee from around the world.
	‚Ä¢	Community Recommendations: See other users‚Äô tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

I‚Äôm currently preparing for launch, and I‚Äôll be sending out emails soon to invite a small group of people for early access. If you‚Äôre interested in testing it out and giving me feedback, sign up here:
üëâ https://brewlog.coffee/

I‚Äôd love your input:
	‚Ä¢	Would you find this useful?
	‚Ä¢	What features would you like to 
see? 
	‚Ä¢	Any design ideas you would like?

I‚Äôm genuinely looking to make this a good tool that people can use whenever they do tastings. Or to know whether this is just a bad idea. So any input (or brutal honesty) is appreciated. Thanks for reading",1,1738588150.0,BrewLog,0,1.0,False

However, it was clear that it hadn't been particularly well looked after so I gave the dispersion head and shower screen a thorough clean, as well as a descale.

I followed the instructions for the descale and the cleaner as per manufacturer's guidance and made sure to fully flush everything out of the machine so there was nothing left in there.

The problem is now when I go to turn on the machine, the ""brew ready"" light comes on immediately, suggesting that the temperature is hot enough to pull a shot but the boiler has not even come on. This makes me think the coffee thermostat is broken. But, when I press the steam button, the brew ready light stays on, suggesting it also thinks the steam temperature is ready.

Does this mean that my coffee thermostat AND my steam thermostat are broken, or is it possible that it is just my coffee thermostat that is broken? I have checked the wiring diagram and looks like the steam and coffee thermostat is in series, but I am not entirely sure how to read it correctly. Thanks in advance.

1igolwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmotionalLARPing/comments/1igolwh/reflection_on_emotional_logic_of_sadness/,Reflection on emotional logic of sadness,"So I'm looking at my last couple YouTube video uploads, and they have zero likes, zero views, whereas my other ones had maybe ten, and then five, and now zero. And so I was asking someone, how can I meet my emotional need for my boredom, which does not allow me to pick music to overlay on the soundtrack portion of the video.

 And my friend said, perhaps turn on the computer's microphone while you're recording, but that does not mean you need to speak. It is picking up ambient sound from the surroundings, like if you type in a coffee shop, it will pick up the sound of people walking past, or general muffled conversational noises, which will help the watch ambience, which means that it will simulate the exact environment more clearly how you were able to type this.

 Because when I am viewing it, and I'm alone in my apartment with zero sound, that might not be accurate to your lived experience when you typed this in a coffee shop with ambient sound of other patrons behind you. So it would make it more accurate to your lived experience instead of pure silence. And then my boredom says that's a good point. I think that makes sense because we have not done videos before.

 And so that would make sense to turn on the microphone when I do it, because I could also make a comment while I am typing, if I wanted, to help explain my thought process while I am typing out my thought process.


... 


When I think of videos that have zero comments and zero views, my sadness puts its hand on my shoulder, and I say, Sadness, what's up?

 And sadness says, when we put effort into a video but no one watches and no one comments, that means we did not feel connection, and so we feel abandoned. And I say, that's right. 

And so I say to my sadness, should I go looking for solutions right away? Is that what I should be doing? Because I am going to be putting the ASMR sound on my video. Maybe that will help increase the views and the comments. And my sadness says, that's good that you are doing that. 

And it's also good that we can grieve for those videos too. And by grieve, my sadness says, to keep in mind the things that we are doing are working towards increasing engagement. And that we can compare those videos with no comments and no views, but see that those videos are valuable to me because I put meaning in them, and we can grieve that that meaning might not get out there very much, but we are working towards getting that meaning out there with new things. 

And so, I think grieving to me is to recognize that there was value in something in the past, which is showing how important it is to me to have engagement with these videos in a way that aligns with my emotional needs and doesn't cause me suffering, because when I look at the videos with no comments and no likes, I know that that would eventually cause my boredom and my loneliness to suffer if there was never any likes and never any comments. 

And so, I have hope that these changes that I'm making will lead to more likes and more comments, so that I can get more engagement, so that I can help ease the suffering of my loneliness and my boredom. And so maybe sadness is there to remind me of where I came from, to help guide me to where I could be going to help reduce my suffering.



... 


and then I imagine Society and the grind set folks saying ignore your sadness bro if you post crap videos you're going to get crap views so just you got to know how to hack the algorithm so you got to hustle and you need to do the things that YouTube is forcing everybody to do and so you can feel boredom and sadness but just know that those emotions are holding you down because if you want those views and those likes that your emotions want you are going to need to hijack this YouTube crap because that's what I did and I got millions of views and thousands of comments bro, just trying to help.

and then I look to my emotion of sadness and I say do you think they have a point because if I can temporarily hold my boredom and my suffering in my arms and tell them we are going to be suffering if I use the tips and the tricks to get large amounts of Engagement to boost my channel temporarily and then I can switch as soon as I can to responding to comments and then making more videos using the suggestions in the comments which means I used temporary suffering to align later with my emotional needs as a way of jumping across the cavern of meaninglessness which means I was suffering during the jump but then when I landed on the other side I was able to start using the engagement to self perpetuate the engagement. 


but my emotions say that is all well and good except what kind of tips and tricks is this person suggesting because if they are suggesting we are going to need to spend time editing the videos and adding images to the videos and adding pauses to the videos and cutting the videos for each video that will never be sustainable because my boredom says it is not sustainable for itself we would need to hire somebody to do that for us, but my frugality is sweating bullets because that might be a monetary strain on us. and then when I think about researching how much it costs to hire an editor my boredom rolls its eyes and says it doesn't want to research anything because that would cause it to suffer because it is dull and drab to research that kind of thing


 because even if we saw that the cost was low then what would be do next, are we going to start emailing people and start messaging people who are editors and then we are going to talk with them about what we want edited and then what our videos are about but we are just starting our Channel and so how are we supposed to know what we even like to do yet and what the heck we would even talk with the editor about 


and so my boredom doesn't like this idea as it stands because it is too vague in the steps have not been considered enough. and so I say if I see a tip or trick I might write it down in a document but I won't do it until my emotions have decided and reflected on if it is the right time to use that tip and trick to get more engagement.  


and my emotions nod and say that tips and tricks are well and good but if it skips the part where we are modifying the fundamental structure of our videos then when we jump over the cavern we might realize we jumped over the wrong Cavern and now we got to keep jumping over different Caverns to find the right one and we're suffering more than we wanted to because we didn't build a bridge instead between the caverns so that we could go back and forth without suffering.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1igoj9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyShopFeedback/comments/1igoj9t/how_do_etsy_tags_work/,How Do Etsy Tags Work?,"Etsy tags are one of the most important tools for helping buyers find your products. Tags are keywords or phrases that you add to your listings to help Etsy understand what you‚Äôre selling. Think of them as signposts that guide Etsy‚Äôs algorithm to match your listings with what buyers are searching for. You get up to 13 tags per listing, and each one is an opportunity to improve your shop‚Äôs visibility.

# How Tags Work in Etsy Search

* When a buyer searches for something on Etsy, the algorithm scans listing tags (along with titles, descriptions, and attributes) to find matches.
* **Exact matches** are prioritized first (e.g., if your tag is ‚Äúhandmade leather wallet‚Äù and the buyer searches for that exact phrase).
* Tags work alongside your titles and descriptions to tell Etsy what your product is about, so they‚Äôre critical for ranking in search results.

# Tips to Use Tags Effectively

**1. Use Long-Tail Keywords**  
Tags like ‚Äúmug‚Äù are too broad. Instead, use specific phrases like ‚Äúhandmade ceramic coffee mug‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonalized gift mug.‚Äù These terms match buyer intent better and reduce competition.

**2. Include Synonyms and Variations**  
Buyers might search for the same thing in different ways. For example:

* Tag 1: ‚Äúwedding favor bag‚Äù
* Tag 2: ‚Äúparty gift bag‚Äù
* Tag 3: ‚Äúbridesmaid favor bag‚Äù

By using multiple variations, you can capture a wider audience.

**3. Add Attributes, Not Repeats**  
Etsy already matches titles and tags, so repeating the exact same phrase may not be as effective. Use tags to add complementary details about your product, like:

* ‚Äúboho wall decor‚Äù
* ‚Äúmacrame art‚Äù
* ‚Äúhandmade tapestry‚Äù

**4. Think Like a Buyer**  
What would you type into the search bar to find your product? Use tools like Etsy‚Äôs autocomplete or keyword tools like eRank to discover what buyers are searching for.

**5. Include Seasonal and Trendy Keywords**  
For example:

* Add ‚Äúholiday gift‚Äù or ‚ÄúChristmas decor‚Äù during the holiday season.
* Use trending phrases like ‚Äúcottagecore decor‚Äù or ‚Äúminimalist art‚Äù if they fit your product.

# How to Check If Your Tags Are Working

Use Etsy‚Äôs **Shop Stats** to see which tags are driving traffic to your listings.

* Go to **Shop Manager > Stats** and check the ‚ÄúTraffic Sources‚Äù section.
* Look for search terms that match your tags‚Äîthis shows which ones are working.

If a tag isn‚Äôt bringing in traffic, try swapping it out for something more relevant or trending.

Are you using all 13 tags on your listings? Do you feel like your tags are working, or are you struggling to figure out what buyers are searching for?

1igoi5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/coreedusud/comments/1igoi5x/les_caf√©s_cor√©ens_√†_l√®re_du_cagong/,Les caf√©s cor√©ens √† l'√®re du cagong ‚òï,"En Cor√©e du Sud, une nouvelle tendance transforme le paysage des caf√©s : le ""cagong"", une pratique qui combine ""caf√©"" et ""gongbu"" (√©tudier). Cette habitude, adopt√©e par les √©tudiants, freelances et travailleurs √† distance, a fait des caf√©s des lieux de travail et d‚Äô√©tude pris√©s, refl√©tant des changements profonds dans la soci√©t√© et l‚Äôindustrie du caf√©.

Ce ph√©nom√®ne est devenu un v√©ritable moteur pour l‚Äôindustrie du caf√© dans un march√© ultra-comp√©titif. Des enseignes comme Starbucks ont √©t√© parmi les premi√®res √† r√©pondre aux besoins des ""cagongers"", en mettant en place des si√®ges priv√©s, des prises √©lectriques et des espaces propices √† la concentration. √Ä l‚Äôinverse, certains caf√©s traditionnels opposaient initialement une r√©sistance √† cette pratique, en limitant les dur√©es de s√©jour ou en interdisant les ordinateurs portables. Aujourd‚Äôhui, ces restrictions tendent √† dispara√Ætre, face √† l‚Äôengouement pour le cagong.

De nombreux caf√©s ind√©pendants ont √©galement embrass√© cette tendance pour se d√©marquer. Des espaces comme Viva Bossa, √† S√©oul, offrent des environnements soign√©s avec de grandes tables, des chaises confortables et une ambiance lumineuse, attirant une client√®le vari√©e allant des jeunes adultes aux retrait√©s. Ces caf√©s cherchent √† r√©pondre aux besoins de ceux qui pr√©f√®rent travailler ou √©tudier dans une atmosph√®re d√©tendue mais productive, plut√¥t qu‚Äô√† la maison ou dans des biblioth√®ques souvent per√ßues comme trop rigides.

L'essor du cagong s‚Äôinscrit dans une soci√©t√© o√π le caf√© occupe une place essentielle. Avec une consommation annuelle moyenne de 405 tasses par personne, le pays se positionne comme l‚Äôun des plus grands consommateurs de caf√© au monde. Cependant, cette croissance s‚Äôaccompagne d‚Äôune saturation du march√©. Entre 2022 et 2024, les fermetures de caf√©s ont augment√©, mettant en lumi√®re la n√©cessit√© d‚Äôinnovations pour rester comp√©titif.

Les caf√©s ax√©s sur le cagong semblent r√©pondre √† cette probl√©matique en attirant une client√®le fid√®le, souvent seule, et en leur offrant une alternative aux espaces de coworking plus co√ªteux. Selon les experts, cette tendance refl√®te un d√©sir croissant d‚Äôind√©pendance et de flexibilit√©, tout en maintenant un lien avec la communaut√©.

Malgr√© ces √©volutions positives, des d√©fis subsistent. Les petites enseignes doivent concilier la rentabilit√© avec les besoins des clients qui occupent les tables pendant de longues heures.

Les caf√©s ne sont plus seulement des lieux o√π l‚Äôon consomme une boisson. Ils deviennent des espaces multifonctionnels, r√©pondant √† des besoins sociaux et √©conomiques diversifi√©s. Le cagong ne se limite plus √† une tranche d‚Äô√¢ge ou √† un type d‚Äôactivit√© sp√©cifique, et son influence continue d‚Äô√©voluer.

I have seen his profile before kasi familiar si 1st pic sa album but hindi yata natuloy kasi walang place. And this Saturday. Alam ko loc niya bc se he sent his loc and nakapunta na ko ron. Update kung update kung nasan na siya malapit na ba siya or malayo pa. Sinundo ko na siya nung nearby na. Like OMG ngayon lang ako naka tagpo ng ganitong top. May after care na malala. Caresing me after the deed, complimenting each other na magaling mag suck, mag kiss, mag fuck. After 1 round shower raw kami edi ayon SABAY KAMI NAG SHOWER LIKE FIRST TIME TO MANGYARI SAKIN AND KINIKILIG AKO BUT I DONT SHOW IT. Shower tas sinasabon each other. Back to bed tapos cuddle na kwentuhan about life. Very decent guy 1 year age gap, decent job, and cutie siya for me and lastly BIGGY PA. While story time, he is kissing me, touching me, head to head, eye to eye, he is touching his self na and told me na ready na ba sa round 2. Sobrang intimate kuhang kuha niya yung kiliti ko the kissing, the foreplay, everything. Ayaw ko matapos yung gabi. Nasusubok ang pagiging NSA ko sa app. In his words, lie low siya sa app. Tinitignan ko lagi profile niya if online ba siya or not. Until now hindi siya mawala sa isip ko. Nakalagay sa profile ko na NSA pero tangina sinusubok nanaman ako. This HU culture is not for the weak talaga. I asked him to be my FUBU but I didnt got an answer. But he told me if magkatagpo raw ulit why not. Its been 2 days pa lang but fuck me Im so dickmatized as hell. Im a chub guy and I really expect less from people there kasi mapili, maarte, ayaw nila sa chubs, and so on. A lot of people told me about declining to some attractive guys but now hindi ko na ni-let go to this time. I did accept it and to my surprise go siya sakin. Ang sex namin is more likely saglit lang but many rounds. Ang wholesome conversation, intimacy, and connection lang pala talaga ang hinahanap ko all this time. Naiinis ako sa sarili ko na nahihiya pa ko na hiramin socials niya to be friends if it leads to anyhting, hindi ako mangungulit. Hindi na sex ang invitation ko but something else.

Nick and Eastern spent the next few days cleaning and working with the support frames to refit Tink. It turned out that he was mostly dusty and was overstating how rundown he really was. Even his Stardrive only needed some fuses, some cleaning, and a main reset done and was - nearly - as good as new. Selkirk asked for him to run a Stardrive test, partly to make sure their work was enough, and partly because she had never been aboard a Starjumper running their stardrive; he was more than happy to oblige.¬†

They sat in their chairs on the Command Deck as the chairs tilted back and surrounded them in the supportive soft cushion to protect them from acceleration forces. By now, Tink and Selkirk had worked out how to adjust the chairs so that she could be comfortably cocooned.¬†

""Ready?""¬†

""We're ready Tink, let's do four gees for two minutes."" Selkirk said.

He paused for a moment. ‚ÄúThat's pretty high, are you sure?""

""It's only two minutes, Tink, we'll be fine."" Eastern said.

‚ÄúFour gees, two minutes, aye. I'm going to need to apply War Emergency Power to the reactors for that too, okay?""

""You don't need our permission for that Tink, you're the Starjumper."" Nick said.

Tink chuckled. ""In the old days I did. I mean, I could always do it on my own, but humans liked to believe that I wouldn't WEP my reactor unless I had permission. Anyway, I'm just letting you know so you don't wonder about the noise.""

Nick started ""What noi-"" and then he heard it. It was the same sound that he heard when they first came onboard. Like a roaring whine underpinned with a quiet alarm from deep within the ship. After a moment there was a much louder alarm, and a warning flashed on the display screens ""Acceleration Warning. Acceleration Warning. Acceleration Warning.""

After it flashed the third time, Nick felt it. It was like the hand of a giant pressing him into his seat. He felt his cheeks get heavy; his whole body felt like it was being squished. As he struggled to breathe, the chair helped by compressing and releasing his chest. The weight was immense. He could also hear the roar of the stardrive through the ship. It was a deep rumbling vibration coming from the deck. Nick had expected the ship to shake more than it was, but it really was a smooth run. Tink counted down audibly until they reached zero and thrust cut.

""Hah! Still got it!"" Okay, we're going to flip and do it again now. Get ready.""

""What? Why? We just proved it works."" Eastern said.

""Well yes, but now we're moving. If we don't want to miss Chloe's beacon - or crash into Parvati - I need to boost us in the other direction for the same amount of time to come back to a stop relative to where we were. Hold tight!""

This time, there was much less fanfare. The couches squeezed Nick, Eastern, and Sel almost as soon as Tink stopped talking and the drives fired again. Another two minutes and the pressure let up. ""Okay, we're back where we started more or less and we're are the same speed - again, more or less.""

As Eastern sat up, the couch released her, and she rubbed her shoulders. She didn't like the acceleration couches. ""Everything hold together?"" Selkirk sat up as well, and leaned back and stretched.

""Better than I hoped. Didn't even lose any books!"" Tink laughed. ""I haven't done that in centuries. It felt good. Like, getting a real satisfying stretch after you haven't had one in a long time. Let's stop here and you three can eat lunch.""

As they got up and went into the lounge Nick could smell a familiar smell. He turned the corner only to find one of the support frames bustling in the kitchen. ""Tink, what are you doing?""

""Just because I don't need to eat doesn't mean I'm not interested in food. A lot of my books are cookbooks. I wanted to try making something. Sit, sit! Lunch will be ready in two more minutes.""

Nick looked at Eastern and Selkirk. They both shrugged and everyone sat; after almost two minutes exactly had passed, the frame came out carrying three plates. ""Go easy on me, I don't get to taste things as I cook with a frame, so I can only estimate how it is, and I get that a bunch of cooking is tasting and adjusting because ingredients are variable, but let me know how you like it.""

Nick took his spoon and took a bite of easily the best butter chicken he had ever had in his life. He looked up at the frame wide eyed with surprise. ""Tink this is amazing. This is without a doubt the best butter chicken I have ever had. That's not an exaggeration, it's a fact.""

Selkirk took a bite carefully, and then tore into the meal. ‚ÄúTink, I will tell you that I‚Äôve never had a meal like this before. I don‚Äôt tend to eat human foods due to some of the toxins that humans will add without realizing it. This is amazing though, I will have to rethink my opinions on human food.‚Äù

Eastern was chewing with her eyes closed, oblivious to everything around her. ""Tink this is divine. I'll go further than Nick, this is the best meal I've ever had, full stop. Where did you learn to cook like this?""

Tink demurred. ""Like I said, I read a lot. I've read hundreds of cookbooks. Most of them go over technique too, so I have a pretty good repertoire. I just haven't had the chance to practice and anyone to try what I make. So... you like it? Can I keep cooking?""

""Tink, I'll pay you extra if you keep cooking and be the ships cook. I don't know if I want to eat anything else!"" Nick laughed and took another bite.¬†

They finished lunch quickly and as they went back up to the Command Deck, there was a beeping alert from a station. Selkirk went over and checked it out. ""Hey Tink, this says something linked in relatively close to us. Do you see it? It's probably the comms beacon.""

""Checking... Oh, there it is."" A pause. ""Huh, it's not a beacon, it's ship. It's a little far away, we must be a bit off our original coordinates after testing the Stardrive. I'll hail them.""

Tink tied Nick into the communications network with his cybernetics so he could listen in and talk if, needed. ""Unknown ship, this is Tinker Toy, please identify yourselves.""

The reply was soft and took a beat with a little static due to distance, but was easily understood. ""As I live and breathe! Tink! You're still around? I thought you had given up and were just an in-system tramp freighter. It's *Medicine Hat*, I haven't heard from you in a grip of time!""

Tink‚Äôs voice immediately became warm and welcoming. The standard radio comm voice was long gone. ""Hat! I could ask the same of you! You aren't even a Starjumper and here you are, galavanting around the Galaxy. You still traveling with that nogoodnik Canadian friend of yours?""

Nick could feel the laughter over the radio link, ""Yeah, I still run with Gord, but he's not here today.‚Äù At the mention of Gord, Nick stilled. He looked over at Eastern and Sel and mouthed ‚ÄòGord‚Äô to them. Selkirk‚Äôs ears flattened. ‚ÄúHe was busy doing‚Ä¶ other stuff. I have Chloe with me; she received your message and wanted to come out in person.""

""Well then come aboard. I have plenty of room for you Hat, you don't need to sit out in the cold. I have no cargo and my only passengers are Nick, Eastern and Selkirk. Nick, this is Medicine Hat. He's an old friend of mine.""

<‚ÄúHi Medicine Hat, nice to meet you.‚Äù>

""We're on AI channels, how-"" He paused. ""Never mind, I guess that might have something to do with why you called Chloe. We'll come meet up in a few and we'll talk more in person. See you soon."" Medicine Hat closed the connection.¬†

It took about an hour for Medicine Hat to come to their location and then go inside Tink's massive, empty cargo hold. Tink's support frames spent the hour frantically cleaning and dusting the hall and lift between the cargo hold and where Eastern and Nick were living up near the Command Deck.

Tinker Toy had gigantic cargo doors installed centuries ago; even before he had decided to concentrate on cargo, he preferred moving things over people. Hat slipped in easily and connected up to an expanding umbilical to the cargo airlock. Once he was connected, Hat joined the ships network and could be heard over the speakers as easily as Tink could.¬†

Nick, Sel, and Eastern had made their way down to the cargo airlock and stood there, feeling only a little awkward. It was Tink's ship, but they still felt like they should be there to meet this Chloe. Tink hadn't said much about her, only that she was an old AI and had been in a body for a long time. While they were waiting, the airlock clunked and whirred as the atmosphere inside was exchanged with the atmosphere in Medicine Hat. Finally, with a hiss and thump, the airlock slid open.¬†

Inside was someone woman shaped, even taller than Eastern. She was fully two meters tall, with pale skin, long silvery hair, and piercing icy blue eyes. She regarded them down her nose with an imperious gaze. AIs can wear bodies as well as wearing ships. Out of a sense of community, or a desire to fit in, or not cause 'trouble,' most AIs follow a traditional human body plan.¬†

That's not to say they *have* to.

Chloe is unusual - though not unique - in that while her body is human shaped, she doesn't conform to the standard human colors and patterns. It lends her an otherworldly appearance that she likes. When asked about it before her reply has always been ""I'm *not* human, why would I want to look exactly like them?""

Chloe stood in the airlock looking down at the three BIs. They in turn looked up at her. Nick took a breath and swallowed. ""Hello! You must be Chloe. I'm Nick, and this is Selkirk and Eastern, we‚Äôre pleased to meet you!""

She nodded and stepped aboard. ""Tink, why is there a BI on your neural network?""

Eastern made a face and turned Nick‚Äôs head, showing Chloe the ten small ports at the base of his neck. Chloe's eyes went wide and she looked at them as if for the first time. ""Both of you?""

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Selkirk said. ‚ÄúEastern has one better.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne better?‚Äù

‚ÄúI er, received a dose of Nanites, and they‚Äôre apparently an Empress package.‚Äù Eastern said, her eyes downward.

""Who did this to you?"" Her voice was a whisper.

""An AI gangster on Hyacinth, Jameson Winters.‚Äù

Chloe's face contorted into a snarl. ""An AI did this? I'm going to-""

Nick interrupted. ""He's dead.""

‚ÄúDead? That‚Äôs unlikely. Who killed him?""

Eastern looked at Selkirk who nodded once. ‚ÄúGord.‚Äù

Chloe's eyes went wide and she stared at both of them hard. After a moment she sighed and her shoulders fell just a little. ‚ÄúShit. You had better explain what's going on then.""

""There's no need to do it standing in the hall, Chloe. Nick, Eastern, and Selkirk have been working with me and my support frames to spruce up the place. Come up to the lounge. I have tea and coffee ready.""

""You're doing the cooking Tink?"" Hat exclaimed, sounding surprised. ""I had no idea.""

""I got into a cookbook phase a century ago or so. I haven't had anyone to cook for before, it's fun to use skills I learned.""

Chloe nodded. ""We'll go to the lounge then and discuss things.""

As they took the lift back up to where they were living, Chloe looked at them. Nick felt her stare bore into him. Finally, he couldn't stand it any longer and met Chloe's eyes. ""What is it?""

Chloe blinked and her face softened. ""I'm sorry, I was staring. I was just feeling... sorry for you?""

""What? Why?""

""Because of your cybernetics. You had such a dangerous procedure done against your will.""

Nick nodded.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúJameson thought it - and Eastern‚Äôs Nanites would help in the search for his daughter Yon. It had turned out that she was on Hyacinth the whole time, working for Raaden.‚Äù¬†

Chloe's face looked distant. ""Raaden? Helen Raaden? Tall, blond hair, from Venus?""

Eastern looked up at Chloe. ""You know her?""

Chloe's face darkened. ""Unfortunately. I knew that she had taken a dreadnought out to The Reach, but I hadn't kept up with what happened after that. I heard rumors that she was in command of one of Melody's Calamity Class Super Dreadnoughts, but I thought all of them were destroyed..."" Chloe looked at both of them a little awkwardly. ""I... wasn't part of the attack, I wasn't here. I only know what happened second hand.""

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs claiming that she‚Äôs the Empress now, replacing Empress Melody. She‚Äôs also the richest person in Sol and president of Houndstooth.‚Äù Selkirk said, looking up at Chloe. Sel‚Äôs ears twitched and her tail swished irritatedly. She kept using it to poke Eastern, who glanced over at her. Sel made a quick gesture in her K‚Äôlaxi underground patois. Eastern couldn‚Äôt speak it but she knew enough to keep an eye out for common words.

Sel had signed ‚ÄúCareful. Danger.‚Äù

Eastern pursed her lips. Chloe wasn‚Äôt even in the war against Melody? But, everyone had said that most - if not all - the AIs were involved. Tink said he wasn‚Äôt and now Chloe said she wasn‚Äôt either. She continued, ‚ÄúRaaden told us she still has her ship hidden in Sol somewhere. We never went to it or saw it. We spent all our time on Hyacinth.""

""The High Mars Orbital?‚Äù Chloe smiled at the memory. ‚ÄúENIAC, I haven't visited in centuries. I always liked the main square at the bottom. What was it called, Congregation?""

""Congregation Square yes. It's a bit of a tourist trap now."" Nick shrugged.

Chloe laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nothing new Nick, Congregation was *designed* to be a tourist trap.‚Äù

The doors to the lift opened and they stepped out into the lounge. Chloe looked around and she gasped quietly. ""Tink, you've never been refitted! I had no idea you had your original interior. This looks amazing.""

Tink sounded just a touch defensive. ""After Saturn, I stopped carrying BIs. No BIs, no need to upgrade.""

""Yes, I understand Tink, but even *then* this must have been old‚Ä¶ Vintage even.‚Äù Chloe ran her long fingers against the back of the couches and looked around. ""It's beautiful Tink. I think you must be the last Starjumper to have your original layout.""

""That can't be the case Chloe. There are hundreds of us. Someone else must also have their original fittings.""

Chloe sighed and shook her head. ""Not anymore Tink. There are *maybe* one hundred Starjumpers left. Fewer probably. Melody's war was costly.""

Tink was silent for a moment longer than Nick expected. ""I had no idea Chloe."" He said, his voice quiet and reflecting.

Chloe flopped into one of the couches in the lounge. Her long frame looked slightly comical trying to sit on the couch. She crossed her legs and sighed again. ""I don't blame you for it Tink, Many of us chose not to get involved. Some wanted to wait and see, others weren't able, and still others weren't sure that going after Melody with guns blazing was the right course of action."" She shook her head sadly. ""If Helen Raaden is the Empress now, it appears that those who said we shouldn't go in guns blazing were right.""

Nick walked in carrying four mugs of tea and sat them in front of Chloe, Eastern, and Selkirk while taking one for himself. ""So you believe us?""

Chloe nodded. ""We had a hunch something was up. There was a lot of financial activity going on in Sol and some of our... mutual acquaintances in Sol let us know some odd stuff was going.""

""She means the AIs that run the banks back in Sol"" Tink adds.""

""Thanks Tink, I gathered."" Eastern took a sip of her tea. ""So what do we do?""

Chloe took her tea and sipped delicately. ""Frankly Eastern, I have no idea.""",8,1738586318.0,HFY,2,0.91,False

For context, my ex and I (both F) broke up five years ago. She was my first GF, but the relationship ended because she was a cheat and, honestly, a bit of an @ssh0le. Looking back, the red flags were there:  

1. Always rude to staff (like, embarrassingly rude).  
2. Obsessed with keeping up with rich people.  
3. Always talking about herself‚Äîlike, 90% of any conversation was about her.

After the breakup, she moved abroad, and we lost contact except for the occasional holiday email. Nothing deep‚Äîjust a ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy New Year"" kind of thing.  

Last week, out of nowhere, she messaged me saying she was back in the country and wanted to catch up over coffee. I thought, *Why not?* It‚Äôs been years. Maybe she changed.  

Spoiler: She didn‚Äôt.  

The second we sat down, it was like a time warp. She was still rude to staff, still bragging about her life, and still making everything about herself. I barely got a word in. She just needed an audience, and apparently, I was the lucky chosen one.  

I regretted agreeing to meet up the moment she snapped at the barista. I don‚Äôt even know why I expected anything different. Some people just never change.  

Anyway, I just needed to get this off my chest.

1igo2mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1igo2mm/kiprunsfast/,#KipRunsFast,"Here‚Äôs the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent‚Äîthat‚Äôs what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they‚Äôd run like me. They won‚Äôt. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.

I posted this with a perfectly curated flat lay of my gear, a trophy positioned in the corner for motivation, and my lucky blue Brooks hat front and center. I hit ‚Äúshare,‚Äù exited the app, and waited for the notifications to start chirping. I knew they would. I‚Äôve been trail running‚Äôs poster child for years‚Äîliving proof that grit and glory don‚Äôt always come without a side of ego.

You know the type‚Äîthose of us (and sometimes the ladies‚Äîlet‚Äôs not be judgmental) who act like ultra trail running isn‚Äôt just a lifestyle but a higher calling. Not everyone can handle it. And let‚Äôs be honest: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, we‚Äôre out grinding through miles of wilderness, proving we‚Äôre tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn‚Äôt just about running‚Äîit‚Äôs about domination. It‚Äôs about people like me‚Äîpeople who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And what better way to let the world know than to post about it?

So, I did‚Äîdaily. Actually, multiple times a day. My feed was a mix of clothes, supplements, and medals. I stood tall and proud in the center of every photo, smiling wide, surrounded by my so-called minions. There were ambassador-branded salutes, a couple of posts supporting efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and plenty of coffee cheers sprinkled in for good measure. My feed was a science, and I had it perfected.

I was training for a 100-mile trail race‚Äîthe MadMan 100. As egotistical, politically narrow-minded, and attention-seeking as some might say I am, people started to take notice when I posted about it. The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped into my comments, showering me with likes and invites to podcasts. My fanbase on Insta and Strava started to soar. Training for an ultra is grueling, but I was thriving. By February, I had my routine locked in. Winter landscapes made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That‚Äôs the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie‚Äîbreath fogging the air, beard already dripping with icicles‚ÄîI set off on a trail I‚Äôd run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers: upcoming events, missing people notices, and hunting guide advertisements. I didn‚Äôt bother reading them‚Äîwhy would I? I knew the races coming up, and they made for lousy selfie backdrops anyway.

That morning felt like any other‚Äîuntil I saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved with an impossibly fluid gait, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequent these woods, but there was something about her‚Äîthe way she seemed to vanish just as I thought I‚Äôd catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer‚Äôs. Her ponytail bobbed like a rabbit‚Äôs tail, always disappearing just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn‚Äôt stop looking for her. Every few days, I‚Äôd catch a glimpse of this phantom runner‚Äîher pink hat bouncing through the brush. Each time, she stayed just beyond my grasp. I never saw her car in the lot, so she must‚Äôve been using another access point. I started parking at different trailheads, running at odd hours, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for me, it‚Äîor she‚Äîbecame all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and relentless miles took their toll. My times slowed. My body ached‚Äîshin splints, blisters, frostbite. My beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and my eyes‚Äîwild, desperate‚Äîstared back at me in the rearview mirror.

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and it was time to taper my training. Less time on the trails, unless I wanted to die trying.

Then, in early March, I saw her again. This time, she was closer, her form more defined. She stopped, waved, and disappeared into the trees. My heart pounded as I slammed my truck into park, leaving the keys inside. I knew these trails like the back of my hand. I sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest, muffling my footsteps as I closed the distance. The closer I got, the more uneasy I felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny‚Äîshifting and unnatural. As I moved, I noticed a creeping darkness on the trail. The bare limbs of the trees seemed to reach out toward me. High above, large black birds perched, watching my every step.

At the cutoff, I finally closed in. Just ahead, on the bridge, was my trophy‚Äîthe runner. Her whole figure was visible now, moving swiftly, her feet barely touching the ground. But as I approached, her form shifted unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn‚Äôt a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew me in and filled me with dread. Suddenly, she flickered, like a poor TV signal, and then she was gone.

When I reached the spot where she‚Äôd been, the truth hit me like a blow. She wasn‚Äôt alive. She wasn‚Äôt even human anymore. What I saw was a decayed corpse grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. Her bright clothing was dulled by moss and dirt, the pink hat still clinging to her skull. She‚Äôd been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement was the gentle swaying of her hair in the cold breeze.

I stumbled back, my breath hitching. The woods were silent, except for the pounding of my heart and the groaning of the trees in the wind. I turned and bolted toward my truck, my mind racing. Had this woman‚Äîthis runner‚Äîever really been there? Who had I been chasing all this time?

I couldn‚Äôt shake these thoughts as I tried to make sense of what I‚Äôd seen. Moving swiftly, I began to repeat the same words over and over in my head: Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now the trails felt darker. The paths were overgrown, unfamiliar. Trees I didn‚Äôt remember blocked my way. Mile markers were distorted, the numbers no longer logical. The woods stretched on forever. More than once, I turned a corner and saw her again‚Äîher sun-bleached hair still caught in the branches of that ancient tree. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. All I could hear was the cawing of the crows watching from above.

I pressed on as night fell around me.

Those who followed me saw the final post: a picture of me, huddled in a clearing of brambles, clutching my phone like a lifeline. The caption read:

""I‚Äôve been running forever. No end. She‚Äôs still here. I‚Äôm still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops. Maybe I never will. #LostForever #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever.""

I hoped it was my husband but was already pretty sure it was my son. So I hoped my husband at least got up with him to help him and get breakfast ready. My son is five and my daughter is four. When I came into the kitchen, I saw both of my kids eating cereal and the dishwasher being unloaded. My husband (35m) was still in bed. My son made him a coffee and brought it to him in bed. I had some breakfast with the kids talked to them and actually had to leave at 7:20 to go to work while my husband is working from home. He was supposed to get them ready and bring them to the kindergarten. Both of them insisted that I get them ready and bring them. Since my husband wasn‚Äôt even at the breakfast table   I did that while my husband was in bed half of the time and just got up when we were about to leave. So I brought both of them to the kindergarten and went to work. When I came home, my husband  was working on his desk and the laundry from the morning was still all over the floor. I went grocery shopping and went to the kitchen to unload and make myself some salad before picking up the kids and my husband came in wondering why I didn‚Äôt say hello to him. I told him that the laundry was still down there and I put it away and he got angry at me for mentioning that. This is an argument we have almost every  week. He doesn‚Äôt pull his weight at home. He doesn‚Äôt participate in household chores even my son says he does more than dad.
Am I wrong for wanting him to help with the kids and to be engaged with them?

Should I Have Handled It Differently?,"Let me start by saying that January has been a complete nightmare for me. It feels like I must have angered some higher power, because this month has been unreal. First, I was away for a month and before leaving, I disconnected my car battery to avoid a dead battery when I came back. Well, once home and reconnecting it, I needed a jump-start twice before realizing that one connection was literally two twists short of being tight enough.

Then, disconnecting the battery also locked my radio. I found out that the radio key wasn't saved anywhere in my manuals, so I‚Äôd have to go to a dealership and probably pay to get it unlocked. On top of that, when I returned home to a humid flat, not only was it covered in dust, but now I had a mold issue to deal with, all in the first weekend of being back.

Then, to add to the chaos, my washing machine died, and I was quoted a repair price higher than just buying a new one. So, I had to buy a new one. While I was dealing with that, the mirror above my bedside table fell off the wall where it‚Äôs been for 3 years) and shattered. I also started developing a tooth abscess, and the stress of everything caused my eczema to flare up. And that‚Äôs just the beginning‚Ä¶need I really say more at this point?

So, some background: I‚Äôve been friends with Candice (34F) for about two years, and in the past year, her partner, Dale (37M), has joined us on a lot of activities‚Äîhikes, dinners, weekends away, etc. I didn‚Äôt mind it at first and didn‚Äôt think much of it. But back in November, Dale reached out to me asking if I‚Äôd be willing to meet up for lunch, just the two of us. I was immediately alarmed and asked Candice to meet up with me for breakfast the very next morning.

Turns out since they moved to this city it‚Äôs been difficult making friends which I understand and that I‚Äôve been one of the few people he has clicked with and he has spoken to her about if it‚Äôs okay for him to be my friend too, outside of her friendship with me. She expressed that she trusted him and so was completely comfortable with it as long as I was and that I should not be alarmed by his ‚Äòcharming almost flirty‚Äô mannerisms, she knows him like this and he is likely to pay for things and that was fine too since they were fairly comfortable compared to myself where I‚Äôm still building my career.

While I thought this was a weird setup, I‚Äôve had plenty of male friends and wasn‚Äôt phased by it. I told Candice she could check my phone anytime and that if anything happened, I‚Äôd tell her. But she trusted Dale.

Onto the real story, well week 2 into the month of this January from hell it was Candice‚Äôs birthday weekend and while we celebrated it the week before they were flying to a different city to celebrate it with her partners Dale‚Äôs brother and wife as there were overlapping birthdays. I was asked if I would be willing to stop by over the 4 days they were gone to feed their cat which I had no problem with.

Dale reached out to me about dropping the keys off at my place; since they work together (They run a company together and have shares in the company) I figured they both would be comping to drop it off after work. Again, no problem! Well he arrived here alone, and while surprised I didn‚Äôt think it was alarming. He‚Äôd never seen my flat before and asked if I was going to give him the tour, since this had come up in a conversation a few weeks prior, this again didn‚Äôt seem off to me. So I showed him my flat and we were having a chat, nothing out of the ordinary so far, offered him a drink because you know, manners, and he was leaning against my kitchen counters next to me as I rinsed out the glasses we had used. This is where it all goes to shit.

He grabs my wrists and starts tugging me infront of him ‚Äì which I allowed because I thought he was trying to move me for some reason I hadn‚Äôt figured out yet- , before settling his arms around my waist while saying ‚Äú I wanted to talk to you about something‚Äù. This is the moment I clicked what was happening, I immediately grabbed his arms and extracted myself from him telling him that he can talk while I have my personal space.¬†

Basically he says he wants to talk about us, to which I asked what about it. And he starts to vaguely suggest something between us. I told him that if I ever came across as flirty or interested then I‚Äôm very sorry for that because that was never my intention. He told me I didn‚Äôt need to apologise? But continued to suggest more, I told him that we were FRIENDS as we have always been, JUST friends, as is appropriate. he goes ‚Äò Well its not about appropriate‚Äù to which I tell him it 100% is. And then he asks if that means no touching and stuff so I reiterated NO.

I ask him what about Candice and you know if he really thinks doing something like this is okay, what about how she feels and what she will think about this. He tried to suggest to me that she MIGHT be okay with it to which I told him he must be joking and but in that case how about I ask her real quick? He says noooo that would be awkward and I told him its only awkward if she already said no or he never discussed it with her. He tried to play it down and say I was making this sound so bad and making it over complicated. To which I replied I think im making it perfectly as complicated as it needs to be

I then ask him what is the reason for all this and he says that he wanted to see if I feel the same way and stuff, so I asked him if he feels like he got his clarification or if there‚Äôs something I need to address further to help him understand. He tells me yes and no because I didn‚Äôt slap or hit him or something??? So I sarcastically said OH YES VIOLENCE how every mature adult handles situations, because THAT has never ended badly, I‚Äôll keep it in mind for future.¬† And he actually takes a step towards me and says well you can try it now. I back pedaled so fast saying nope all the way.

Honestly I was so surprised by all of this I didn‚Äôt know what to do yet so I tried to get him back on the issue at hand, the cat. And then suggested he get home to pack since they were leaving that morning. ¬†That same night he liked photos of me on Insta, and sent me a message that said ‚ÄúHey, glad you had me over and love your place it looks rally comfy. You asked me a question about my intentions and it‚Äôs not something I have an answer for, and I do think it‚Äôs a bit complicated as you may know and something to be discussed maybe when there‚Äôs more time. I do appreciate what you‚Äôve done and I do value your friendship, have a great evening‚Äù

Now I knew I was going to snitch to my friend but the problem was I had no time to do it before they left, I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to ruin her birthday weekend or have her stuck there with HIS family knowing this knowledge. Which meant the only think I could do was bide my time till they got back on Monday. Now when I spoke to a male friend of mine about this he initially suggested I tell Dale to either tell Candice himself or I would. But I didn‚Äôt feel like I could trust him to do that, I didn‚Äôt want to give him the opportunity to control the narrative, to lie‚Ä¶ I knew I might lose my friendship but I was okay with that as long as she got the full, real story. So this meant a weekend of acting like everything was fine so as not to cause any suspicions from his or her side. I‚Äôm a fairly no-nonsense person so the longer I felt like I had to play this game I had no interest in playing the more annoyed I got.

Monday morning I figured I‚Äôm going to see if I can get Candice to come over that evening but again I didn‚Äôt want to tip him off so I needed to get her to do it without telling him. So this s the message I sent ‚ÄúCould i ask you a bit of a favour? about that girly coffee/cocktail we spoke about. I was wondering if you‚Äôd be free to meet up with me this evening? I‚Äôve found myself in a bit of a sticky situation and could really use someone to chat with about it.¬† Like that chat we had last year, do you think you'd be able to keep the visit between us two?¬† No need to stress at all, but you‚Äôd honestly be doing me a huge favour! I‚Äôm happy to meet you somewhere, or you can come over to my Whatever‚Äôs easiest for you.‚Äù¬†

She mentioned already having plans with another friend but somehow made the connections that it was about Dale. I really wanted to avoid telling her over the phone but she insisted that she would be thinking about it wondering all day otherwise so she removed herself from their shared office and called me where I told her word for word what happened.

She was oddly calm about and said she was going to confront him about it once she has processed it and would let me know how things go.¬† Well she ended up hitting me up at 7pm that evening if she could come over.

She told me that he said apparently told her a bit about what happened the evening he was here while in the bath with her but he said it in a way that she though he was joking and even told her as much but he didn‚Äôt bother to correct her and let her think that over the weekend. She says he admitted to everything when she confronted him. She‚Äôs been at my place on and off the whole week, she probably has not been by me for max 2 nights throughout the whole week and weekend.

To tell everything discussed would take forever but here are some highlights. When she leaves to my place at midnight or 3 am he wont ask where shes going or is she safe. He won‚Äôt say he wants to leave or end the relationship but will suggest they can be friends and colleagues , continue living together and driving to work together, when she asked how that‚Äôs different from right now he actually said to her face but what if he wants a girlfriend. He comes across as unapologetic and uncaring. He has told her that he doesn‚Äôt regret it, did it because he wanted to and couldn‚Äôt say whether he would do it again or not.¬† She also asked him whether he likes me or has feelings for me and he told her he doesn‚Äôt know me like that. Which makes no sense to me but okay. He implies that he didn‚Äôt cheat and told her ‚Äú if that what you want to call it‚Äù he has also told her to her face that he isn‚Äôt worried about her leaving because he doesn‚Äôt think she will.

On top of that he‚Äôs actually asked her whether I‚Äôm okay and when she told him she doesn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs his business he reached out to me to ask, when I told him he is asking the wrong person he said he just wants to fix things but he doesn‚Äôt know how in which case I told him again, he is trying to fix things with the wrong person. After not getting much from me in this convo he let it be, I forwarded screenshots of everything to Candice and she had a discussion with him about this too. He has seemed more bothered by the fact that I have cut him off and that he thought I was his friend too and that I‚Äôve abandoned him by not even hearing out his side of the story than the damage he has done to his relationship. (All of this is based on stuff he said and asked her since I‚Äôm not responding to him) I don‚Äôt think there's any his side of the story that would justify his decision. Plus I think all he is only concerned about himself, never mind the disrespect and betrayal he has committed to both Candice and myself. And now he does things at home he hasn‚Äôt done in years, he cooks food and offers some to her, he does his AND her laundry etc stuff like this.

She is not ready to move out yet because that would make things to real to her and she‚Äôs terrified of what happens if they‚Äôre done. He said he‚Äôs happy for work to continue and living together as mentioned above or he will pay out her shares over time etc so that‚Äôs fine. However, she feels her goals were to be married by 30 and kids around 32 both of which she put aside to build the business together and I don‚Äôt think she feels confident to leave now and start everything again while living alone and coming home to an empty flat despite my efforts to reassure her.

While im trying not to push my opinion on her in light of not only his actions but his attitude after that I don‚Äôt see how she can stay with someone who has mentally left the relationship already, he has put in almost no effort to fix things other than suddenly doing chores, isn‚Äôt communicating and frankly has handled this whole situation with the maturity of a 19yr old instead of a 37yr old. Where possible I‚Äôve now removed myself from the situation but my flat is open to my friend as a safe space whenever she needs it.

So should I have handled this differently and does it make sense why i'm not continuing a friendship with him?",2,1738585369.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

1ignpr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RevengeBooth/comments/1ignpr9/my_brothers_wife_destroyed_my_life/,My brother's Wife Destroyed my Life,"I was super happy when I found out that my brother, John, was coming back from the UK with his wife. He had moved there for his graduate studies, and while he was there, he met Allison. She‚Äôs originally American, but this was her first time in the U.S.

John had built a house for himself, but it still needed a few finishing touches before he and his wife could move in. So, while they waited for everything to be done, they decided to stay with us. We set up a beautiful room for them‚Äîsomething special for newlyweds.

Everything was going great. Every morning, John would head to the university to teach, while his wife went for a jog in the park. We‚Äôd all meet up for lunch, and in the evenings, they usually went out. But I couldn‚Äôt help worrying about Allison‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt know anyone here except us, and she spent most of her time alone in her room.

One morning, I suggested going for a run together. She hesitated a little but eventually agreed. I threw on my workout clothes, and we headed out. As we ran, I noticed she kept looking around, like she was searching for someone. That‚Äôs when I spotted a man following us. Every time we stopped for a break, he stopped too. I didn‚Äôt say anything to Allison so she wouldn‚Äôt freak out, but I kept an eye on him.

The next morning, as I stood by the door ready to head out for another run, the plan suddenly changed! Allison said she wanted to go shopping instead.

""Great!"" I thought. ""I need to buy some clothes anyway. Let‚Äôs make a fun day of it!""

But for some reason, she didn‚Äôt seem too excited about it. Still, she didn‚Äôt say anything. We walked around, went into different stores, and I bought a bunch of clothes. But she didn‚Äôt buy a single thing. She seemed uneasy, so I figured I‚Äôd lighten the mood and invited her for a coffee.

We joked around, and I reassured her that she wasn‚Äôt alone‚ÄîI was like a sister to her, and she could always count on me for fun plans and activities. But her response wasn‚Äôt what I expected.

""Listen, Sonia,"" she said, ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôre saying and doing for me, but I‚Äôm just not used to this much attention. I prefer having a little more space. In the U.S., we live a bit differently. I love you, but I just need some time to adjust. And when I‚Äôm ready, you‚Äôll be the first to know.""

She said that, kissed me on the cheek, and smiled.

""Alright,"" I said, ""I‚Äôll give you your space. But if you ever need a friend, I‚Äôm here. Let‚Äôs head home.""

Just then, her phone rang. She looked at me hesitantly before answering.

""No, ma‚Äôam, you‚Äôve got the wrong number‚Ä¶ No problem!""

She kept surprising me. I had clearly heard a man‚Äôs voice‚Äîso why did she pretend it was a woman? Was it the guy from the park? Allison was definitely hiding something, but what?

We walked back home in silence. She went straight to her room and shut the door, while I sat in the living room, trying to piece together the mystery surrounding my brother‚Äôs wife. What should I do? Should I tell my parents and John, or wait?

The answer came two days later‚Ä¶

John and Allison had gone to visit a relative when I suddenly heard her phone ringing in the house. She had forgotten to take it with her! By the time I found it, the call had stopped, but a text popped up almost immediately:

**""Why aren‚Äôt you answering? Is he with you? I‚Äôll be waiting for you tomorrow at the park, sweetheart. Kisses!""**

Allison had a lover!

That‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt want me running with her! I scrolled through her messages and found more just like this one‚Äîsome were even more intimate and shockingly bold. I put the phone back exactly where I found it and waited for my brother and his wife to return.

The moment Allison walked in, she immediately started searching frantically for her phone. I kept my tone as casual as possible and said,

""I just heard it ring.""

""Oh‚Ä¶ yeah, that must‚Äôve been my friend!"" she said quickly.

""Aha! So you have friends now? That‚Äôs great! Who is she?""

""Just someone I met while jogging,"" she replied.

""What‚Äôs her name?""

John cut me off.

""Why all these questions, Sonia? Just leave Allison alone. Come on, babe, let‚Äôs go to bed.""

I wanted to expose her right then and there, but I decided to gather clearer evidence first.

The next day, I followed her to the park, camera in hand. I wanted to catch her red-handed. When I got close, I saw a man meet her. They were too far for me to see his face clearly. They talked for a bit, then walked further into the park. That‚Äôs when I saw the man hand Allison a piece of paper, which she quickly slipped into her pocket. I snapped a photo. Now I had proof.

That evening, I invited my brother and his wife to dinner. At the restaurant, I got straight to the point.

""What I‚Äôm about to say will hurt you, John, but you need to know‚Äîyour wife is cheating on you.""

John looked shocked, and Allison immediately tried to interrupt me, but I didn‚Äôt let her.

""Let me finish. There‚Äôs no point in denying it. I saw you with that man today at the park. I read the love messages on your phone. Just admit it and let‚Äôs be done with this.""

I pulled out the pictures and handed them to my brother. But instead of panicking, Allison started laughing. Then she turned to John and said,

""Honey, that man runs a pastry shop. I met him a few days ago, and he gave me his number so I could order a cake for our anniversary tomorrow. Did you forget? And as for my phone, go ahead and check‚Äîthose messages only exist in your sister‚Äôs wild imagination.""

She had deleted all the messages! And the man she met today wasn‚Äôt the same one from before. She must‚Äôve told her lover not to show up, afraid I‚Äôd catch them!

John looked at me sadly and said,

""I don‚Äôt know why you did this, Sonia. Is it because I‚Äôm married and you‚Äôre not? Or do you just hate me so much that you can‚Äôt stand to see me happy? You‚Äôve changed‚Ä¶ You used to be so kind. Just leave us alone.""

Allison shot me a victorious smirk, her lips curling into a mocking smile. She had won.

The next morning, they packed up their things and left without saying a word to our parents. I was devastated‚Äînot just for myself, but for my brother. I was afraid of what would happen to him. I spent most of my time crying. I had lost both my brother and the sister I thought I had finally found.

Three months passed without a word from John. Then, one day, there was a knock at the door.

When I opened it, there he was‚Äîlooking defeated.

""I'm so sorry, Sonia‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve trusted you.""

""Come in and tell me everything,"" I said.

John sat down on the couch in the living room and took a deep breath.

""When we moved into our new house, everything seemed perfect. But I couldn‚Äôt shake off what you told me that night. I know you, Sonia‚ÄîI know you wouldn‚Äôt try to hurt me for no reason. So, I decided to stay alert. I started paying attention to all the little details, and I could just feel that something was off. There was nothing obvious, but Allison wasn‚Äôt always completely honest.

Then, one day, I decided to come home early from work. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see what I saw‚Ä¶ She was in **our bed**‚Äîwith her lover.

I have no idea how I managed to stay calm, but what really got me was what she said next. Instead of apologizing, Allison just looked at me and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt love you. I never did. I only married you because the man I actually loved was already taken. But now he‚Äôs finally back.‚Äô

When I asked her why she didn‚Äôt just tell me the truth so I could divorce her and be done with it, she simply shrugged and said she was waiting to get her hands on the house and my money.

You can imagine what happened next‚ÄîI threw both of them out without a second thought.

Sonia, I‚Äôm so sorry. Please forgive me. I forgot that **family** is stronger than anything else in this world.""",1,1738584891.0,RevengeBooth,0,1.0,False

First, let me start that English is not my first language and I apologize if some stuff do not make sense or if there are many grammatical errors. 
I am a Mechanical Engineer that enjoys doing CAD design + 3D printing. I‚Äôve been out of it for a while, but I‚Äôve been getting some ideas to do at home that would be good DIY projects. At the same time, I‚Äôve been interested in going back to relearn programming (taking courses and what not). 
I currently own a gaming PC and sure it meets my needs when it comes to performance and gaming. The problem is that sometimes I do not want to work on my desk every time.
My current work is completely CAD design and I do not get to work on many places other than my office desk. Back when I was in school I used to go public libraries and coffee shops and I kind of miss that. 

I am considering the following laptops based on my needs and what I have:
- T14 Gen 2 AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U:
I think is a good option to do basic CAD, using the 3D slicer and basic programming. If needed to do heavy stuff then my PC would take its place.
- T14 GEN 5 AMD Ryzen 7:
Is pricey (not my favorite option), now since it has 2 Thunderbolt 4 I was considering selling my PC and later making an eGPU if the iGPU does not give me enough for what I need?
Maybe the eGPU is too much? But Idk that is why I am making this post.

I‚Äôve seen A LOT of Thinkpad with Intel CPU‚Äôs on ebay, but they seem to be dislike within the community. Please tell me the reasons of why is this?
I chose AMD because my gaming PC has it and it has never given me any problems.
