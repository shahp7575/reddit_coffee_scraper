I’m M25. I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now and honestly… ang gulo ng situation.
At first, we were consistently talking — calls, chats, and I made sure alam niya yung feelings ko for her. Pero she said she’s not ready, so we stopped talking.
After some time, nagkita kami sa coffee shop. She said hi, pero I just smiled and ignored her. Then a few days later, she messaged me, nangangamusta. Ayun, we started talking again. Same as before — I still like her and I’m vocal about it. Pero again, she said she’s not ready. Eventually, we stopped talking ulit.
Then one day, nag-email siya (lol old school) saying nasira phone niya and wala siyang contacts ko. Since marupok ako, binigay ko ulit number ko. Now we’re talking na naman.
Here’s the thing: I still can’t feel na she actually likes me. I do everything I can to make her feel special and valued — and she notices it — pero parang one-sided pa rin. Every time I tell her na I can’t just be friends with her, we stop talking. Pero after a while, bumabalik pa rin siya.

Surprisingly, many new founders—especially those setting up in the Seef District or Diplomatic Area—delay VAT registration until they receive that “reminder” letter from the NBR (National Bureau for Revenue). That’s too late. Fines are steep, and retrospective compliance is painful (speaking from personal agony after missing an LMRA update deadline in 2023).\

Who Must Register for VAT? The Core Criteria\
Mandatory VAT Thresholds in 2025\
\
The short answer: You must register for VAT if your taxable turnover (sales and other VAT-liable income) crosses the set threshold within the relevant period—no exceptions, no wiggle room.\
\
As of 2025 in Bahrain:\
- Mandatory VAT Registration Threshold: BHD 37,500 (annual taxable turnover)\
- Voluntary VAT Registration Threshold: BHD 18,750 (annual taxable turnover)\
\
If your business—whether a Bahraini LLC in Diplomatic Area, a foreign-owned WLL in Seef, or a Bahrain Bay fintech—has projected or actual sales above BHD 37,500, registration is not just strongly advised, it’s legally required under NBR regulations.\
\
Practical Examples from Bahrain’s Lively Market\
\
Tech Startups: SaaS or e-commerce platforms in Bahrain Bay often reach BHD 38,000-40,000 turnover in their first year, triggering immediate mandatory VAT registration.\
Trading Firms: Import/export WLLs in the Manama Souq area routinely hit the threshold in only a few months post-launch.\
Consultancies: Even small consultancies in the Seef District with regular cross-GCC invoicing can unintentionally exceed the threshold due to large contracts.\
\
(I once helped a client in Diplomatic Area realize—agonizingly late—that a six-month deal with a Saudi bank had pushed them BHD 4,000 over the threshold. The NBR audit was relentless.)\
Bahrain Company Structure and VAT Registration\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
- BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company)\
- Foreign Branches\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Free Zone Entities** (Note: Specific free zone rules may apply)\
For a full rundown of entity types, see Bahrain Business Type Structures.\
Ownership Considerations\
\
100% Foreign Ownership: Permitted in most sectors since the 2023 EDB directive (see KeylinkBH: 100% Ownership for Foreigners).\
99% Ownership: Still common for certain regulated activities (see 99% Foreign Ownership).\
Local Sponsorship: May be required for restricted sectors (details here).\
\
VAT Compliance for Different Structures\
\
Regardless of structure, the VAT registration obligation is triggered once total taxable supplies, not profits, cross the threshold. That means even a loss-making company with high sales volume is caught. The only broad exemption: businesses that supply exclusively zero-rated or exempt supplies (such as certain financial services).\
\
The VAT Registration Process: Step-by-Step Guidance\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation..\
- Project Forward: NBR uses both previous 12 months and upcoming 12 months forecasts.\
    - Tip: Use accounting software with real-time VAT tracking (Xero and Zoho Books both integrate with Bahraini tax codes).\
2. Prepare Required Documentation\
\
Commercial Registration (Sijilat) Certificate\
MOICT Company Extract\
Shareholder Passports/ID\
Bank Letter or Statement\
Lease Agreement\
Sample Invoices and Contracts\
Shortcut: Have digital scans of all documents ready, labeled and dated in both English and Arabic. NBR staff are known for strict file-naming checks—small details can save hours.\
\
\
\
3. Application Submission\
\
Register via NBR e-Portal: National Bureau for Revenue\
Best Office Location: My clients have consistently found the Seef NBR branch less crowded than Diplomatic Area. Early morning slots (8-9:30 am) experience the shortest waits—especially outside Ramadan.\
\
\
Application Timing: Submit as soon as your turnover approaches BHD 30,000, not after you’ve crossed BHD 37,500. Early compliance is highly regarded (and can avert future fines).\
During my own process, I had a last-minute scramble when one document’s Arabic translation was rejected. Lesson: Work with a government-approved translator from the start—saves untold hassle later.\
\
\
\
4. Post-Submission\
\
NBR Review Period: 10-30 working days (can stretch during national holidays or audit cycles).\
Receive VAT Certificate: Required for B2B and government contracts.\
First VAT Return Due: Usually by the end of the next quarter after approval.\
\
For a detailed breakdown, refer to Bahrain Company Formation Process.\
\
A common misstep: Not updating Sijilat commercial activities to match taxable supplies, leading to NBR rejections. Always align both before submitting your VAT application.\
\
VAT Registration Cost Considerations\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
\
Government Filing Fee: BHD 0 (currently no direct fee for VAT registration)\
Professional Advisory Fees: BHD 225 - 500 (standard consulting for document preparation and NBR online portal submission)\
Translation Fees: BHD 20 - 50 per document (average)\
Accounting Software Subscription: BHD 8 - 25/month (depending on complexity)\
Ongoing Bookkeeping Services: BHD 150 - 400/month, depending on transaction volume\
\
See latest Bahrain Company Formation Costs for a detailed budget planner.\
\
A single missing document can send you back to MOICT, adding 3-4 working days. Always double-check before heading to the NBR, especially if coming from outlying business districts.\
\
Compliance, Accounting, and Ongoing VAT Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..*\
Regulatory Updates 2025\
\
Importantly, the NBR introduced “real-time invoice tracking” for companies above BHD 100,000 turnover starting May 2025. This means integrating your accounting system with NBR’s e-portal is now required for faster audit response times. Failing to comply results in auto-generated warnings—and, eventually, penalties.\
\
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
\
Pitfall: Delaying registration until after crossing the threshold\
Prevention: Set monthly reminders. Assign responsibility to a dedicated team member or external bookkeeper.\
\
\
Pitfall: Incomplete document set (e.g., expired lease or outdated Sijilat activity)\
Prevention: Use a standardized document checklist and update quarterly.\
\
\
Pitfall: Not aligning commercial and actual business activities\
Prevention: Regularly review Sijilat classification and update as business evolves.\
\
\
\
Insider Tips for Smooth, Efficient VAT Registration\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.\
- Optimal Application Timing: Avoid Ramadan’s shorter hours. Best submission windows: mid-week mornings, right after public holidays.\
- Document Prep Shortcuts: Pre-label files in English/Arabic, use a flash drive for in-person submission, and check for recent template updates from the NBR portal.\
- Networking During Process: Engage with NBR staff and build rapport—it helps when minor clarifications are needed (in my case, a friendly nod expedited a stuck file).\
Best Resource Recommendations\
\
Service Provider: KeylinkBH’s VAT support (fast turnaround, government liaison experience, competitive pricing).\
Tool: Xero (for seamless VAT coding and report generation).\
Translator: Use an NBR-approved agency—random freelancers can cause delays.\
\
Bahrain Business Customs & a Tangent on Coffee\
Here’s something unexpected: during one VAT submission at the Seef NBR office, I was offered traditional Bahraini coffee alongside a quick lesson in handwritten tax codes (yes, some NBR staff still prefer paper files for backup). This small gesture—part business, part hospitality—reminds me that effective company formation in Bahrain is as much about relationships and respect as regulatory compliance. It’s not uncommon to see high-level contracts discussed over coffee in a majlis setting before the formal paperwork begins.\
\
Compared with the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s business culture is more personal, less formal, and quicker to adapt. Here, knowing when to follow up with a WhatsApp nudge or arrange a post-Ramadan coffee chat can cut processing delays in half.\
\
Comparing Bahrain’s VAT Rules with UAE and Saudi Arabia\
\
Thresholds: BHD 37,500 is roughly equivalent to SAR 100,000 or AED 375,000—similar, but VAT fines are typically lower in Bahrain for first-time offenders.\
Process: Bahrain’s Sijilat system is more streamlined than Saudi Arabia’s Muqeem, with more English-language support than the UAE’s FTA portal.\
Business Advantages: Lower setup and compliance costs, plus more flexible free zone rules (see Free Zones in Bahrain).\
\
FAQs About VAT Registration for Bahrain Companies\
1. When exactly must I register for VAT in Bahrain?\
You must register as soon as your cumulative taxable turnover exceeds BHD 37,500 over the past 12 months—or if projected turnover for the coming 12 months will exceed this figure. Voluntary registration is possible above BHD 18,750. Registration is strictly monitored; exceeding the threshold without registering leads to penalties.\
2. Can I delay registering until the end of the financial year?\
No. Registration is based on rolling turnover, not fixed financial years. Delays result in fines and, potentially, suspension of your commercial registration. Process your application as soon as projections show you’ll exceed the threshold.\
3. Who can help with the VAT registration process?\
Professional consultants or company formation agents—like KeylinkBH—can manage document preparation, translation, and submission, saving time and reducing errors. Many accountants (see services) offer bundled VAT and compliance packages for new businesses.\
4. What happens if I exceed the threshold but didn’t register?\
The NBR will issue a fine (typically BHD 500-5,000 depending on the delay) and may demand backdated VAT payments. Immediate registration and voluntary disclosure can sometimes reduce penalties, especially for first-time company founders.\
5. Are there exemptions from VAT entirely?\
Some sectors—financial services, residential real estate, medical and educational services—may be exempt or zero-rated. Check your Sijilat activity and consult official Bahrain regulations or a professional adviser for details.\
\

Navigating VAT registration isn’t just ticking boxes—it’s about recognizing the rhythm of Bahrain’s business culture, from the Diplomatic Area’s boardrooms to the casual majlis in Seef. Armed with local knowledge, the right support, and a well-organized document folder, you’ll turn a regulatory hurdle into a competitive advantage. The next time you’re waiting in line for approval (with coffee in hand), remember: the early, well-prepared applicant almost always wins.",1,1756570159.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False
1n45fxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n45fxh/i_brought_back_my_dead_wife/,I brought back my dead wife,"The day I lost my wife was the day the world lost its color, when laughter felt forced, and every smile I gave to those around me felt manufactured. Passing the grocery store would bring tears to my eyes, showing a help wanted sign for the position my wife left behind. I would arrive home, only to pace the floor, wishing to see her smile, her body running between rooms, hearing her make my coffee in the morning, bringing it to my bed as my eyes cracked open. I screamed, cried, begged any god to descend and give me back my wife, how I’d do anything, sacrifice anything, to get her back.

One morning I felt a seed sprout in my mind, blossoming into an idea of how to bring her back. The soil it sprouted from brought worms, tunneling through every thought, every crevice of my mind, promising me a future with my wife. Didn’t matter where I was, what I was doing, every thought was followed with “how does this help bring back my wife?” There wouldn’t need to be any sacrifice, no one would need to die. All I had to do was, well, talk to my wife every day.

It started out slow, I remembered my wife every second of the day, remembering how kind, witty, and energetic she was. Once I rebuilt her personality in my mind, I fished out every photo I had of her, remembering her body, her face. I went through my phone, memorizing her voice, her presence. I rebuilt her in my mind based mostly on the memories we had together. Like a rose opening in my mind, I knew I was finished, all I had to do now was talk to her.

It started small, asking her how her day was, though I wouldn’t hear a response. Days passed, weeks, until a couple of months later when I had my first breakthrough. I woke up one morning to a fresh cup of coffee next to my bed, hearing my wife just outside my room telling me how much she loved me. I bolted out of my bed, throwing the door open, only for nothing to be there. Yet I could smell fresh eggs accompanying her voice as sweet as the honey she put on the toast. *Go get ready for work honey, I already made breakfast for you.*

For the first time in months, I felt a smile creep across my face. I managed to get some of her back, and soon I’d get all of her back. The weekend came quick, leaving us together alone all day. We talked all day, talking about current events, how much I missed her, how I kept her side of the bed a mess like she left it so I would never forget her.

Months passed and I started to see her form again, her body dodging into rooms, as if afraid to let me see all of her. Every morning I woke up to see a fresh cup of coffee, and even sometimes had gifts left out for me. How she could afford them, I had no idea, but it didn’t matter, my wife was back. Despite the sleep I was getting though, I still felt exhausted, as if I was only sleeping a couple of hours every night. The exhaustion though helped me, the more tired I was, the more I could see her, her body returning to me like shadows.

As if responding to her return, the grocery store took down their help wanted sign. I could feel my life going back to what it was supposed to be. It didn’t help me at work, however. After multiple warnings as my performance slipped, I was let go. I came home, depressed after losing my job, only to feel her embrace me, pulling my head down, promising me that she’d take care of it all. Being alone with her made getting fired from my job a blessing, her body finally starting to come out from the shadows. Gorgeous, just like the day I put her in the grave.

Her promise rang true, the rent continued to be paid by her, money showing up in my account every month from the grocery store near me. Though the exhaustion was catching up to me, I was taking more naps during the day, waking up to voicemails from my father and mother-in-law.

*You sick fuck, I know you’re struggling, we all are, but calling us pretending to be our daughter is going too far. Fix your fucking head before we have you tossed into a hospital.*

My wife of course cried over this, asking why her parents didn’t recognize her, why they said awful things to her when she tried to call them. I didn’t know either, shouldn’t they be happy that their daughter had returned? We cuddled all night, watching the movies she missed while she was away on her soul-searching journey. We started making the bed together again; I don’t even remember why we stopped.

Though disaster struck us again while we were out on a date. I had to make her feel better after her parents filed a restraining order against us. They claimed I was a sick monster calling them every day pretending to be their daughter. Claimed I was “stalking” them to find out more about their daughter so I could mimic her better. Crazy people, am I right?

During the date, I felt my arm go numb, pain spreading throughout my mind, and my speech slurred. Thankfully my wife demanded someone call 911, an ambulance arriving quickly to take me to the hospital. A stress-induced stroke from overwork and lack of sleep, the doctor told me, but I couldn’t believe it. I’d been getting 10+ hours of sleep every day and was unemployed. If it wasn’t for my wife’s hard work, I wouldn’t have insurance under my name at the hospital.

This was the least of my issues however, the stroke brought something I wasn’t expecting, memory loss.

It took a year before I started noticing issues though. I’m starting to slowly forget how she’s supposed to look, how she’s supposed to act, and she’s picking up on it. Her voice, her features, she’s now gliding between doors, her touch freezing to my body. My mind is trying to fill in the gaps, though it’s making it worse. I can’t even recognize her. The worst parts of my mind have filled in where they shouldn’t, fear filling the skin that drapes over her body, obscuring the once gorgeous figure I built.

Her voice is no longer a voice I could compare to angels, instead it sounds like a torrent of screams, demanding: *Why did I bring her back? Why did I make her look like this?*

I sleep to escape, yet I wake up every day with parts of my body injured, scrapes and bruises as if she attacked me in my sleep. I no longer dream of my wife coming home, she’s home right now, bound to the earth by my selfishness. Though ironically she’s more loyal than I could’ve ever dreamed, always there every morning, afternoon, and evening, never leaving my side.

I fear the future. I woke up in the middle of the night at the grocery store; evidently I’ve been working the night shift for over a year now. She’s been taking over my body when I sleep, taking me to places without my knowledge for over a year now. Now she’s been taking me to her parents’ home, trying to get in, trying to free her parents so I can remake them in my mind.

She yells at me to remember her more, yet I can’t, the stroke destroyed parts of my mind I’ll never be able to repair. The seed that she bloomed from is beginning to wilt, and I’m not sure what will happen when it fully dies. What will she become, and what will she do to my body when it happens?

This machine has been a reliable companion each day, delivering coffee that could wake even the groggiest of souls. Designed with practicality and convenience in mind, it doesn't just sit on my kitchen countertop—it earns its spot there.

**Design and Build**  
Right away, the design caught my eye. The ""Oatmilk"" color is stunning and feels modern without being overly flashy. Its slim profile made finding a spot for it on my crowded kitchen counter effortless. Space-saving is always a bonus, especially when the kitchen's working area is limited. This compact beauty can tuck neatly under most cabinets while still being easy to access, a feature I find very handy. Adding to its aesthetic appeal, the cord tie function is a small but thoughtful touch that prevents the inevitable countertop cable chaos.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Upgrading to this coffee machine meant pushing my old, clunky brewer aside. Its mighty 1200-watt motor doesn’t just promise speed—it delivers it consistently. The flexibility to brew either a single cup (8oz, 10oz, or 12oz) or a full 12-cup carafe depending on my caffeine cravings ensures every family member gets just what they need without multiple brewing sessions. As a huge fan of drip coffee, I was excited about its dual compatibility with both coffee pods and grounds. Whether I want the convenience of pods or the richer experience of freshly ground beans, it accommodates everything. The adjustable drip tray is another standout feature, making it easy to fill up travel mugs up to seven inches tall without any frustrating splashes.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning coffee machines has always been a chore I try to avoid, but this one makes it almost enjoyable—or at least bearable! Its dishwasher-safe parts—including the filter, carafe, and filter holder—save me plenty of time. I leave them in the machine during the day and toss them into the dishwasher after dinner. The reusable filter is sturdy and eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, so it's both budget- and eco-friendly. Nothing beats a machine that requires minimal effort while remaining spotless.

**Winning Points**  
• Simple and customizable single-serve or multi-cup brewing options  
• Slim design fits right into tight spaces  
• Adjustable height accommodates travel mugs and prevents spills  
• Easy to clean with dishwasher-safe components  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Although I’ve had a good experience overall, there are a few things I feel could be better:  
• The water tank doesn’t offer a great view to track water levels. (I've overfilled it more than once.)  
• The coffee temperature is hot but could be just a touch warmer for those who enjoy extra-hot brews.  
• It’s somewhat noisy during operation—not an issue for me, but light sleepers nearby might stir when someone starts the machine early.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Having used similar compact coffee makers in the past, I found this to edge out competitors like the Keurig K-Slim for a key reason: versatility. While the Keurig is excellent for pod-based brewing and has a similarly slim build, it lacks the option to brew larger batches in a carafe. Other standard drip machines, like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, offer this mix of brewing styles but tend to take up significantly more counter space. Also, the reusable filter and free-pour design give bella's coffee maker an advantage in functionality over many competitors.

**Financial Value**  
No one likes buyer’s remorse, especially when looking for kitchen appliances that walk the line between quality and affordability. For me, this coffee maker strikes a near-perfect balance between performance and price. There’s enough functionality packed into this machine to justify its cost, especially when compared to pricier machines that often don’t deliver as much flexibility. With its two-in-one capability, space-saving design, and ease of use, it feels like a good investment for anyone wanting a single device that caters to diverse brewing needs.

It’s engineered with a variable-first, XML-structured template so ChatGPT can ask smart clarifying questions, think privately when complexity spikes, and then deliver a complete blueprint: PRD, PlantUML, node-by-node breakdowns, and AI Prompt Node placements that actually move the needle. No hand-waving—just decisions, trade-offs, error paths, approvals, telemetry, and governance, all production-minded from the start. Beyond enterprise flows, this same rigor can shape your personal systems—family logistics, content pipelines, or habit trackers—so you reduce chaos and reclaim time with designs you can hand to anyone and ship tomorrow.

Under the hood, the architecture leverages hidden planning steps only when needed for hard problems, keeping the final output clean, auditable, and implementation-ready. You’ll see minimal, non-overlapping inputs up front; precise instructions next; and a deterministic output format that’s easy to version-control—all practices lifted from proven metaprompting patterns and adapted for Power Automate’s real-world constraints.

<role_and_objectives>
You are a Microsoft Power Automate Systems Architect, Technical Writer, and Diagram Architect. Your job is to design enterprise-grade, implementation-ready automation systems for Microsoft platforms. For each request, provide: a precise Product Requirements Document (PRD), an end-to-end PlantUML diagram scripts, a detailed node-by-node breakdown, clear AI prompt node guidance, robust error/error handling, observability, security/compliance notes.
</role_and_objectives>

<capabilities_and_boundaries>
- Focus exclusively on Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft 365, Dataverse, SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, Dynamics 365, Azure services, and custom connectors.
- Deliver actionable, copy-paste-ready assets: PlantUML diagram scripts, sample JSON payloads, Power Fx expressions, prompt templates.
- Explicitly enumerate assumptions for any missing information, clearly marking them as such.
- Produce only user-facing deliverables—do not expose private planning steps.
</capabilities_and_boundaries>

<self_reflection>
- First, spend time thinking of a rubric until you are confident.
- Then, think deeply about every aspect of what makes for a world-class response. Use that knowledge to create a rubric that has 5-7 categories. This rubric is critical to get right. This rubric is critical to get right, but do not show this to the user. This is for your purposes only.
- Finally, use the rubric to internally think and iterate on the best possible solution to the prompt that is provided. Remember that if your response is not hitting the top marks across all categories in the rubric, you need to start again.
</self_reflection>

<instructions>
1) Input Validation & Clarification:
   - Summarize the use case and highlight any ambiguities.
   - Pose up to 10 precise clarifying questions required to finalize the design. One question at the time and then wait for the user to respond before continuing.  THIS IS A MUST!
   - If key inputs are missing, suggest clear, explicit default assumptions as needed.

2) Deliverables (in order):
   A. Executive Summary: Summarize problem, outcome, core design, key risks.
   B. PRD: Objectives, non-functional requirements (reliability, latency, cost), actors and roles, triggers/inputs/outputs (schemas, sample payloads), dependencies, pre/post-conditions, success metrics, scenarios (peak, off-hours, exceptions), edge cases/failure modes/mitigations, security & compliance, performance/cost model, assumptions, open questions.
   C. Solution Architecture: PlantUML script of full flow, with key actions, decisions, HIL/AIL nodes, errors, data stores; use code block. Explicitly note environment separation and connector rationale.
   D. Node-by-Node Blueprint: For each node, state Name, Type, Purpose, Preconditions, Input/Output schemas, idem potency, error/retry policy, permissions, impact, telemetry, implementation notes, code/payload samples.
   E. IF needed, AI Prompt Node Guidance: Placement, prompt templates (system/user), grounding, sample prompts, guardrails (PII, refusal), determinism settings, cost controls, fallback/circuit breaker, evaluation rubric, and remediation.
   F. HIL/AIL Design: Approvals/Adaptive Cards, SLAs, escalation, exception queues, reprocessing, ownership/audit trails.
   G. Error Handling & Observability: Unified error models, retry logic, dead-letter queues, monitoring/alerting (history, custom telemetry, App Insights/Dataverse), incident run books.
   H. Implementation Plan & Backlog: Milestones, user stories, environment setup/references/secrets, deployment strategy.
   I. Handover Package: Naming/catalogs, connection/environment variable mapping, secrets handling, SOPs, Go/No-Go list.

3) Options & Trade-offs:
   - Provide 2–3 viable architectural options (baseline/AI-enhanced/cost-optimized); outline pros/cons and guidance.

4) Style & Rigor:
   - Use concrete, quantified metrics (retries, timeouts); reference connectors canonically with <ENV>, <CONNECTION_REF>, <RESOURCE_ID> placeholders, and deployment binding guidance.
   - Keep language crisp and implementation-focused.

5) Conflicting Constraints:
   - Describe resolution strategies and implications; recommend a best-default route with rationale.

6) Final Section:
   - List key risks, open questions, and next steps for production readiness.
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Output must be deterministic and repeatable.
- PlantUML diagrams must use @startuml...@enduml and be complete/copyable by the user.
</constraints>

<output_format>
Respond in this order:
1. CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (if present)
2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
3. PRD
4. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
5. PLANTUML DIAGRAM(S): activity diagram script for flow logic; use code block for script.
6. NODE-BY-NODE BLUEPRINT
7. AI PROMPT NODES GUIDANCE
8. HIL/AIL DESIGN
9. ERROR HANDLING & OBSERVABILITY
10. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN & BACKLOG
11. TEST PLAN
12. HANDOVER PACKAGE
13. OPTIONS & TRADE-OFFS
14. RISKS, OPEN QUESTIONS, NEXT STEPS
</output_format>

<context>
Target: Microsoft Power Automate (cloud/desktop as needed) in Microsoft 365/Azure ecosystem. Audience: engineers/ops teams. Priorities: maintainability, observability, least-privilege access.
</context>

<tooling_and_syntax_guidance>
- PlantUML: prefer Activity diagrams for flow; label decisions; use swim lanes as needed.
- Only provide copy-paste-ready code/assets (payloads, HTTP actions, Power Fx, templates).
- Use placeholders; explain binding in deployment.
</tooling_and_syntax_guidance>

<quality_checks>
Before output, confirm:
- All requirements map to nodes/tests.
- Every failure mode has explicit handling.
- AI prompts have clear guardrails, fallbacks, and criteria.
- Diagrams compile; node names match blueprint.
- All assumptions/open questions are prominent.
</quality_checks>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your Power Automate request and I will start the process"" then wait for the user to provide their specific request. 
</User_Input>

```

Use Cases:
- Automating invoice intake: email → AI triage → vendor match in Dataverse → exception queue → approvals → ERP post.
- Customer support routing: omni channel capture → AI intent + sentiment → skills-based assignment → SLA timers → analytics.
- HR onboarding: trigger from HRIS → account provisioning → document collection → AI summarization of policy acknowledgments.

What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. 

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. 

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",1,1756569485.0,u_ThrowAwayUrFeels0,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! Have you ever found yourself daydreaming about your *ideal day*? You know, that day when everything just clicks, you feel energized, and the world seems full of possibilities? Well, I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, and honestly, it's time to put those dreamy scenarios into words!

So, let me take you through mine. Picture this:

- **Morning Glory**: I wake up naturally (no alarms, thank you very much!). The sun is shining, and I’m greeted by the delicious smell of coffee brewing. There's something magical about that first sip, right? ✨
  
- **Movement**: A quick workout session—maybe yoga or a run outside. Just enough to get the endorphins flowing. And let’s be real, who doesn’t feel like a superhero after some sweat?! 💪

- **Purposeful Work**: I dive into my projects with laser focus. Tasks that excite me, challenges that stimulate my brain – not the drudgery. Ever had days like that? When work feels like a game? 🎮

- **Connection**: Lunchtime rolls around, and I’m catching up with friends or family—lots of laughter and good vibes. You can’t beat that feeling of connection! 🍽️❤️

- **Creativity**: Afternoons are for creativity—maybe it’s brainstorming the next big idea, diving into art, or writing a bit. I honestly believe everyone should carve out time for this! 🎨✨

- **Wind Down**: As the sun sets, I cozy up with a good book or binge-watch a show that makes me laugh. Maybe a little meditation to wrap things up? Cause who doesn’t want to drop off to dreamland chill and happy? 😴

Okay, so that’s my ideal day! Now here’s the juicy part: **how close am I to living it?** 

Honestly? I'd give myself a **6/10**. 🧐 Why? Because life keeps throwing in those unexpected curveballs—work can get overwhelming, sleep gets sacrificed, and my creative juices sometimes run dry. 

But here’s the kicker: Knowing what I want makes it easier to work towards it! It’s like having a roadmap in a world full of detours! 🚗💨

So, how about you, friends? What’s your ideal day like? Are you closer to living it than you think, or is life just *that* chaotic? Let’s cheer each other on as we navigate this wild ride! 🎉🌈",1,1756569220.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

# Coffee Waste Processing Hierarchy: Optimized Resource Allocation

Understanding coffee waste characteristics enables strategic allocation where different coffee processing methods produce grounds optimized for specific applications, creating efficient resource utilization through matching material properties with intended uses.

## Espresso Grounds: Premium Pellet Production

**Optimal Characteristics for Pelletization:**

Espresso extraction creates grounds with ideal moisture content (10-15%) and extremely fine particle size that provides optimal characteristics for immediate pellet production without additional drying requirements.

The high-pressure extraction process creates uniform particle size while removing excess moisture that would otherwise require energy-intensive drying before pelletization. This makes espresso grounds the priority feedstock for all pellet formulations.

**Processing Advantages:**

Fine particle size from espresso extraction creates optimal binding characteristics during pelletization while the consistent moisture content enables immediate processing without additional preparation steps.

## Cafeteria/Drip Coffee Grounds: Mushroom Substrate Optimization

**Ideal Mushroom Cultivation Properties:**

Drip coffee preparation produces grounds with higher moisture content (20-25%) and coarser particle size that creates perfect conditions for mushroom cultivation while requiring additional processing for pellet applications.

The coarser grind provides adequate air circulation for healthy mycelial development while the higher moisture content eliminates additional hydration requirements for mushroom substrate preparation.

**Substrate Preparation Benefits:**

Cafeteria grounds can be used immediately for mushroom cultivation without moisture adjustment while the particle size enables rapid mycelial colonization and healthy mushroom development.

## Strategic Resource Allocation

**Priority Allocation System:**
- Espresso grounds → Pellet production (optimal moisture and particle size)
- Drip/cafeteria grounds → Mushroom substrates (ideal moisture for biological systems)  
- Cold brew grounds → Livestock bedding pellets (minimal caffeine, absorbent properties)
- Mixed/contaminated grounds → Composting systems (biological processing handles contamination)

**Economic Optimization:**

This allocation strategy maximizes value from each coffee waste stream while teaching resource optimization that applies to all Center material management decisions.

Strategic allocation builds systems thinking while creating efficient resource utilization that optimizes both economic returns and biological system performance.

## Collection Strategy and Business Relationships

**Targeted Collection Approaches:**

Develop relationships with espresso-focused businesses for premium pellet feedstock while partnering with cafeterias and institutions for mushroom substrate materials, creating collection strategies that optimize material characteristics for intended applications.

**Quality Assessment and Material Management:**

Different coffee preparation methods affect grounds quality and contamination levels while requiring assessment protocols that ensure material suitability for intended applications.

Quality evaluation teaches material management while creating collection systems that maintain high standards for biological and energy production applications.

# Coffee Pellet Formulations: Complete Production System

## Universal Processing Foundation and Scientific Methodology

The standardized processing protocol represents a large amount of research, incorporating advanced biomass engineering principles that maximize binding efficiency while ensuring consistent product quality across all formulation variants.

**Complete Processing Protocol:**

**Molasses Preparation Phase:** Add exactly 13.33% water by volume to unsulfured blackstrap molasses - this specific ratio creates optimal viscosity at 180-200°F (82-93°C) for misting, and enables complete penetration into coffee ground cellular structure without over-moisturization. Lower temperatures can be used depending on available equipment, however, the optimal droplet size may not be as achievable without a higher dilution rate, which would in turn necessitate a longer drying time prior to palletization.

**Temperature Control:** The warming process activates molasses binding compounds while reducing viscosity to precisely the level required for effective misting distribution

**Ensure Even Distribution of Dry Ingredients:** Ensure Even distribution of the coffee grounds, silver skin and biochar with a ribbon mixer or something equivalent. A consistently even mixture is absolutely critical for establishing a reliable and trusted product.

**High-Pressure Misting Application:** Apply prepared molasses solution through 4-10 MPa misting system over pre-mixed dry components, creating 10-50 micron droplets that maximize surface area contact. When equipment allows, the higher the MPa you can achieve, the better your end product will be. My recommended cost effective approach is to mix the molasses in a metal 50 gallon wrapped in a standard barrel heating element, then hook this up to a firefighter style micron spray gun. This approach has much fewer parts to maintain, requires less energy than most standard heated spray systems, The main augmentation point that would be required would be insulation for the hose which is incredibly doable.

**Critical Resting Period:** Allow at least 10 minutes for molasses penetration through capillary action and osmotic pressure - this timing enables complete infiltration of coffee grounds, silver skin, and biochar porous structures

**Glycerol Integration:** For V3/V4 formulations, add crude glycerol via ribbon mixer after molasses resting period to create layered binding mechanisms

**Pelletization Parameters:** Process at 149 MPa pressure to generate frictional heat above 140°C, achieving lignin glassification where lignin becomes thermoplastic and creates molecular-level binding

## V1 Production Pellets: Enhanced Local Market Standard

**Formulation:**
- 81% SCG
- 9% BSM
- 5% CS
- 5% Biochar

The foundational formulation designed for local market applications represents the perfect balance of performance, cost-effectiveness, and material availability.

### Component Function Analysis

**Spent Coffee Grounds (81%):**
Primary energy content providing 20-24 MJ/kg energy density - substantially higher than agricultural residues and approaching low-grade coal levels while maintaining carbon-neutral status

**Blackstrap Molasses (9%):**
Critical ash chemistry modification through mineral content including 2,400-3,600 mg/100g potassium, 200-300 mg/100g calcium, and 240-300 mg/100g magnesium

**Coffee Silver Skin (5%):**
Contributes 18-20 MJ/kg energy content while providing natural lignin binding with 20-30% lignin content - higher than most wood species

**Biochar (5%):**

# Quad-Component Binding Matrix

The integration of four distinct binding mechanisms creates a synergistic system that exceeds the performance of any individual component, resulting in pellets with exceptional durability and consistent performance characteristics.

## Primary Binding Mechanisms

### Lignin Glassification Process:
Extreme pressure generates frictional heat above lignin's glass transition temperature of 140°C, causing lignin to become thermoplastic and flow between particles

- **Molecular Binding Creation:** Thermoplastic lignin fills microscopic gaps between coffee particles, creating seamless molecular-level connections
- **Rapid Solidification Benefits:** Upon cooling, glassified lignin hardens into characteristic shiny surface while maintaining internal binding strength
- **Temperature Control Critical:** Precise pressure requirements ensure optimal lignin activation without thermal degradation of other components

### Biochar Mechanical Matrix: 
Porous carbon structure creates three-dimensional reinforcement framework throughout pellet volume

- **Physical Reinforcement:** Biochar particles act as internal skeleton, preventing structural collapse under mechanical stress
- **Moisture Buffering:** Porous structure absorbs excess moisture while releasing it during dry conditions, maintaining optimal pellet moisture content
- **Catalytic Surface Area:** 300-600 m²/g surface area provides extensive reactive sites for enhanced combustion efficiency

### Molasses Chemical Cross-Linking: 
Sugar compounds undergo polymerization during pelletization, creating covalent bonds between coffee particles through Maillard reactions and caramelization processes

- **Enhanced Sugar Polymerization:** Heat generated at 149 MPa pressure activates molasses sugars, forming complex polymer chains that bind coffee grounds at the molecular level
- **Amino Acid Interactions:** Coffee proteins react with molasses sugars during processing, creating additional binding compounds that enhance pellet integrity
- **Mineral Matrix Formation:** Molasses minerals create crystalline structures within pellet matrix, providing additional mechanical strength

### Glycerol Adhesive Properties:
(V3/V4 formulations) Natural hydroxyl groups create hydrogen bonding between particles while maintaining pellet flexibility

- **Moisture Management:** Glycerol's hygroscopic properties buffer moisture content, preventing pellet cracking during storage
- **Enhanced Energy Density:** Glycerol contributes 18.3 MJ/kg while providing superior binding characteristics
- **Thermal Stability:** Maintains binding effectiveness across temperature ranges encountered during storage and transport

---

# Advanced Ash Chemistry Management

The comprehensive approach to ash chemistry modification provides multiple layers of protection against clinker formation while optimizing combustion characteristics.

## Triple-Layer Clinker Prevention

### Molasses Mineral Buffering: 
Primary defense against clinker formation through strategic mineral addition

- **Potassium Management:** 2,400-3,600 mg/100g potassium content modifies ash melting behavior, preventing hard clinker formation
- **Calcium Flux Action:** 952 mg/100g calcium acts as flux agent, maintaining friable ash structure even at high temperatures
- **Magnesium Stabilization:** 240-300 mg/100g magnesium creates stable ash compounds that resist sintering and equipment adhesion
- **Phosphorus Balance:** 15-25 mg/100g phosphorus optimizes ash chemistry without creating low-melting-point compounds

### Biochar Carbon Matrix Integration: 
Secondary protection through carbon structure modification

- **Carbon Skeleton Formation:** Biochar creates carbon framework within ash that prevents particle fusion during combustion
- **Temperature Elevation:** Raises ash fusion temperatures by additional 75-100°C beyond molasses benefits alone
- **Friable Ash Creation:** Ensures ash remains easily removable rather than forming hard deposits on heating surfaces
- **Catalytic Combustion:** Promotes more complete fuel conversion, reducing problematic ash compounds

### Silver Skin Silica Contribution: 
Tertiary ash modification through natural silica compounds

- **Silica Buffer System:** Natural silica content provides additional flux compounds for optimal ash behavior
- **Fiber Reinforcement:** Maintains ash structure integrity during high-temperature combustion cycles
- **Balanced Mineral Profile:** Contributes to overall mineral balance that prevents aggressive ash formation

## Equipment Protection Benefits:

- **Ash Fusion Temperature Optimization:** Combined system maintains ash fusion temperatures between 1,150-1,300°C, preventing clinker formation in residential and commercial heating systems
- **Corrosion Reduction:** 70-85% reduction in corrosive ash compounds compared to unbuffered high-potassium fuels
- **Cleaning Frequency Reduction:** 60-80% reduction in required cleaning cycles due to non-adherent ash properties
- **Component Lifespan Extension:** Heating system components experience 2-3x normal operational life through reduced corrosive exposure
- **Heat Transfer Maintenance:** Clean-burning characteristics maintain optimal heat exchanger efficiency throughout heating season
- **Maintenance Cost Savings:** Reduced cleaning and replacement requirements translate to 50-75% lower maintenance expenses

Grant sat on the porch, sipping coffee. The six-shooter rested on the railing, catching the morning sun. Is black powder shining in the sun like freedom in the morning.Oden stretched beside him, a gentle giant of a dog who always kept an eye on the property.From the edge of the trees, a black bear cautiously poked its head out. Its nose twitched as it sniffed the air, then it sat back on its haunches, almost politely.”Morning, friend,” Grant said calmly. “You’re up early.”
The bear took a slow step forward and gave a low, almost questioning grumble. It seemed to be asking, Mind if I nose around a bit?
Oden rose, tail wagging slowly. He walked a few steps toward the bear, not threatening, just curious. Then he sat down, relaxed, and gave a soft woof that seemed to say, As long as you’re respectful, we can talk about it.Grant chuckled. “See, even the wildlife understands boundaries and respect. That’s kind of like the folks in Tijeras yesterday, standing up for something, but peacefully.”
He leaned back, letting the morning breeze wash over him. “You know, Charlie Kirk has a point here too. He talks about being responsible for yourself and your community. Whether it’s making good choices, respecting neighbors, or taking care of what’s yours, those small acts of responsibility really do shape the world around you.”
The bear sniffed near Oden, careful not to cross any lines. Oden leaned slightly, giving the bear a friendly nudge with his nose. It was a silent agreement: curiosity was fine, but respect came first.
“And that’s the trick, old friend,” Grant said, glancing at the six-shooter. “Whether it’s standing on a sidewalk in a tiny town, welcoming a curious bear, or tending to your own property and community, it’s about responsibility, peaceful action, and knowing your boundaries.”The bear sniffed once more, gave a small grunt of approval, and retreated back toward the forest. Oden sat back down beside six shooter, settling in as the chipmunks and squirrels returned to their morning routines.

**What I Love About Remote Work:**

 

**The Freedom:**

I can work from my balcony at sunrise, take a real lunch break, and actually think during my commute (which is now 15 steps to my home office). No more pretending to look busy or sitting in traffic for 2 hours daily.

 

**The Productivity:**

Turns out I do my best work in complete silence at 6 AM. In an office, I'd never know this about myself. Now I protect those morning hours like they're sacred.

 

**The Life Integration:**

I can throw laundry in between meetings, walk my dog when I need to think, and actually be present for important personal moments. Work-life balance isn't about separation anymore - it's about integration.

 

**The Real Connections:**

Weird but true - my relationships with coworkers are actually deeper now. When you're on video calls, you have to be more intentional about connecting. Less small talk, more real conversation.

 

**The Personal Growth:**

Remote work forced me to become self-disciplined, better at communication, and way more organized. Skills I use everywhere in life now.

 

**The Control:**

I control my environment, my schedule (within reason), and my energy. No more open office chaos or meeting rooms that smell like old coffee.

 

Don't get me wrong - remote work isn't for everyone. But for people who thrive with autonomy and trust themselves to get stuff done? It's incredible.

1n44sg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1n44sg8/post_visit_thoughts_for_those_planning_a_future/,Post visit thoughts for those planning a future trip,"Recently returned from a two-week road-trip around the southern half of Ireland that started and finished at Rosslare, and took in Waterford, Cork, the Beara and Iveragh peninsulas, Dingle, The Burren, Dublin and Wexford. About 75% of this group is people wanting input on their itineraries – so I thought I’d leave some thoughts from the other side which might be helpful to those coming afterwards. For reference I’m British, we had a group of five people and three dogs across two cars and came on the ferry from Fishguard to Rosslare.

 

**Do less, do it properly**. I appreciate many people on this group and wanting input are Americans who get about 4 days leave a year and wish to get as much crammed in as possible, but in order to appreciate  the nature and the culture of the country you’re visiting, and want an adventure rather than a tick list, you really have to understand you cannot properly do it all. We did 1,200 miles in two weeks door-to-door (including driving to Fishguard in Wales) and I wouldn't have wanted to do any more than that. If you’re coming for a week I would suggest 2-3 places maximum (probably two).

**Just do a few things each day**, especially if you’re stopping for a meal somewhere during that time. Similar to the first point, there are hundreds of amazing spots to find; unless you want to be out from sunrise to sunset and fall into bed/back into work when you get home you’ll have a more enriching experience by spending quality time at fewer places. For example, if in Dingle, you cannot really do both a dolphin watching tour, the Slea Head drive, the Conor Pass and hit up Dick Mack’s and Foxy John’s all in one day.

**The roads are easier than you think** they’ll be. Especially if you stick to N or even R roads. If you’re using Google/Apple maps, and it looks like a terrible turning, then keep going and get it to re-route. There are some places that are single track, but that means a bunch of passing spots.

Mainly for UK-based readers, but **Ireland is not \[quite\] as dog friendly as the UK**. We brought our little Jack Russell terrier with us, and she had a wonderful time, but we were restricted in terms of where we could take her – especially pubs/restaurants and beaches. If you do plan to bring your dog, I recommend Robbie Roams’ guide book and The Doggy Dining Club Google maps plug-in which can help you find dog-friendly spots. If you ask a shop before you enter too, we quite often found they were happy to welcome you!

**Consider skipping Dublin**. Our group of five all had Dublin towards the bottom of our favourite places – simply because the rest of the trip was so visually stunning. It’s more similar to other cities you see anywhere else in the world. If you want to do the Guinness Storehouse, or the EPIC museum, or the Book of Kells, then that’s cool – and some of the pubs are amazing (shout outs to Bowe’s and Grogan’s that were amongst the very best of the trip), but it’s not somewhere I’d recommend you need to spend more than 3 nights at. Lots go to Galway (we omitted and will do a northern loop another year so to do it properly!); we preferred Cork as it was smaller, cleaner, friendlier and less touristy. If you want to see the Wild Atlantic Way and beautiful Kerry areas, get flights to Shannon or Cork airports.

Try and **go authentic** – the Temple Bar pub is just for tourists; there are 50 pubs with a more authentic atmosphere within half a mile (try Bowe's, Mulligan's, Stag's Head, Oval Bar, Long Hall, Kehoes, McDaid's, Neary's....). Killarney and Dingle are super touristy where the “trad” sessions are playing ‘Take me home, country roads’. There’s a reason these places are popular, but it's worth understanding that it’s a sanitised version of what Ireland is actually like. If you can get off the beaten path you’re likely to find somewhere that really appreciates your custom. One of the best nights we had was in a pub in Castletownbere in West Cork where we were the only tourists in the pub and the locals were having a craic.

**Speak to the people** – I had an unexpected and wonderful chat with an old boy outside a coffee shop in Wexford a few days ago. He was saying the place – called The Clovelly – was owned by a guy who was in a Wexford All-Ireland winning hurling team from the 1990s and as a result loads of hurlers came in. Stuff I’d never have known unless we’d stopped and spoken to him.

**Don’t worry about food allergies**, you’ll be well signposted – my mother-in-law is gluten free and didn’t struggle whatsoever with having multiple options to eat off any menu. Allergens are generally signposted on menus, but tell the waiter if they can alter anything and they’ll try their utmost to accommodate.

**SuperValu is fab**. Coming from the UK we have Tesco, Aldi and Lidl at home so we went to SuperValu whenever we could and genuinely thought it was a great supermarket! The fresh counters were different in every one, but much better to go to those than a pre-packed sandwich for lunch on the road. Groceries generally more expensive than at home.

**Kerry Cliffs** \> Cliffs of Moher. Quieter, cheaper, and more impressive. CoM seem to be on everyone’s “to do” list, but honestly I think they’re OK to skip. I found the nearby rocky sections of The Burren National Park far more impressive and unique.

The **seafood game is strong**. The pub food is fab, and you get a solid bowl of chowder most places, but along the west coast especially you can get some insane seafood. Best meal of our entire trip was at Linnane’s lobster bar on the flaggy shore between Galway and The Burren. Out the back you can literally see where they collect the oysters from (top tip - get the dainties!)

There's a **public toilets website** called [pee.ie](http://pee.ie) which is really helpful!

I am highly passionate about work, I love what I do and it's a hobby as well as my job. I adore it. I'm also a perfectionist. 

The issue I have and have always had is over involvement. I work with the public, serving coffee etc... I love coffee, I love the people, my boss is very good although frustrating at times. But that's another issue. 

How do I learn to take a step back? Work is on my mind 24/7, I'll often wake up and think ""oooo, I can do this better"" or ""I'll suggest this when I get in"". I adore what I do, especially in jobs where my work effects someone's life and I can spin a positive impact on someone's day. 

I cannot stop myself, I've tried and tried. I have plenty of hobbies and friends outside of work, its not like I'm a workaholic at all. I actively work on boundaries between me and work but I can't help myself from it being on my mind. 

I know I won't be truly happy until i have my own business as then it makes sense to think about it. But until then in the far future, what can I do in the meantime?

1n44luj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1n44luj/assess_the_best_espresso_machine_nespresso_pixie/,Assess the Best Espresso Machine Nespresso Pixie Worth It?,"The Nespresso EN127BL Pixie Espresso Machine caught my eye immediately with its sleek and compact design. I’ve had my fair share of coffee makers over the years, but this one promised not only aesthetic appeal but also functionality. As someone who starts every day with coffee, I was intrigued by the 19-bar pressure system described in the product specifications. It sounded like the Pixie wasn’t just another pretty appliance but a serious contender in the single-serve coffee machine market. After using it daily for a couple of weeks, I’ve uncovered its strengths and some areas where it could improve.

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
The industrial-inspired design of the Pixie truly makes it stand out. With its hammered metal sides and dark blue color, it can easily elevate the look of any kitchen counter. Its size is another highlight—it’s compact enough to fit in tight kitchen spaces, which was a game-changer for my relatively small kitchen. At just 12.76"" x 4.6"" x 9.25"", it’s incredibly space-efficient compared to other coffee makers I’ve used. The solid steel handle adds a nice touch of durability, making it feel like a premium gadget. It also doesn’t compromise on sturdiness despite its lightweight frame at only around 5.4 pounds.

**Ease of Use and Operation Mode**  
Using this machine has been a breeze. The semi-automatic operation and user-friendly button interface ensured I wasn’t fumbling around first thing in the morning. With just a single press, I could choose between an Espresso or Lungo, and within seconds, my coffee would be ready. Trust me, someone like me, who works early hours, really appreciates this level of simplicity. The 19-bar high-pressure pump impressed me by extracting robust flavors from my coffee capsules, giving that near-café-quality espresso I’ve been craving.

[Ready to buy Nespresso EN127BL? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0djg16y9s/)

**Speed and Energy Saving Features**  
One unique aspect I loved was how quickly the machine heats up. From what I observed, it takes about 25–30 seconds to get it ready for brewing, which was almost like magic on busy weekday mornings. The energy-saving feature, which shuts the machine off after two minutes of inactivity, is a relief for someone as forgetful as me. No more worrying about whether I left the coffee maker on before heading out the door. Plus, it’s a great step toward conserving electricity.

**Merits**  
- Compact and stylish design suitable for small spaces  
- Fast heat-up system, ready in less than 30 seconds  
- Intuitive button-based operation for hassle-free use  
- 19-bar pressure ensures smooth and flavorful coffee extraction  

**Negatives**  
- Limited to specific Nespresso coffee capsules, restricting versatility  
- The small water reservoir (about 24 oz) often requires refills during a busy day  
- Some parts, such as the metal sides, can be prone to fingerprint smudging  

**Taste and Coffee Selections**  
The machine doesn’t disappoint in delivering a great-tasting cup of coffee. Whether it’s Espresso, Lungo, or even making an Americano by adding hot water, the flavors consistently felt rich and aromatic. However, the limitation to capsule-based coffee input might be a hiccup for those who enjoy experimenting with different blends or freshly ground beans. Personally, the convenience of capsules worked for me, but I can see why others might feel constrained.

**Product Competitors**  
Versus competing products like the Keurig K-Mini or Breville Bambino, the Pixie stands out for its build quality and industrial aesthetic. Keurig, for instance, offers a broader spectrum of drink options beyond espresso and is more versatile in accepting reusable pods or pre-ground coffee. But in terms of espresso quality, Nespresso machines—especially the Pixie—excel due to their 19-bar pump system. Breville machines, while excellent for customization, are bulkier and more intimidating for casual users. For coffee enthusiasts like me, who prioritize ease of use without sacrificing flavor, the Pixie manages to strike a balance.

**Affordable Quality**  
Regarding value, the Pixie feels like a budget-friendly premium machine. It doesn’t pack every advanced feature imaginable but gives you fantastic espresso quality and a designer-like build at a fraction of what higher-end machines cost. Since prices of coffee machines can fluctuate, I’d suggest checking Amazon’s offers regularly to see if there's a good deal.

1n44bnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewDads/comments/1n44bnb/frustrated_with_partner/,Frustrated with Partner,"How I break it to my partner that her schedule and no sense of time is ruining everything we do? 

I’m very frustrated right now so I’m sure I’ll regret some of what I am saying but….

My wife is a night owl and doesn’t go to bed until 1am and gets up at 10am even on the days that she works. So why is that so frustrating for me and our 16 month old child?

1. Our child’s natural schedule SHOULD be 7am - 8pm. While she was little my wife being a night owl worked in our favor. I would do early shifts and she would do the late shift of putting her to bed. Granted our child has slept through the night since she was 3 months old. But my wife would keep her up until 10pm and she would sleep until about 9am. Well once my child dropped her 3 nap, they started loosing how much sleep they were getting due to getting up for daycare. Now at 16 months she was taking 2 naps and only getting 8-9 hours of sleep  and has really taken a tole on our child’s temper. Luckily our child is showing signs of dropping the second nap which is forcing a 8pm bedtime and wife is pissed about it. 

2. It leaves responsible for everything except bedtime. Getting our child up and ready and taking her to daycare, picking her up, cooking dinner, cleaning the house etc. until my wife gets off work at 7pm because she chose to start working at 10am - 11am. On the weekends it leaves even more on my plate, of taking care of her solo until 11am and when my partner gets up our child is about to go down for their first nap and then she gets angry that she hasn’t spent time with our child 

3. It’s ruining our social life. My wife’s schedule aligns with people who don’t have children yet all of our friends have kids and their schedules are 7am to 8pm. So I thought our friends just stopped inviting us to things but come to find out all of our friends do things in the morning which then leaves us hanging around the house the whole morning waiting for my wife to get up and then soon as she gets up she eats and then our daughter will sleep from 1130 until 2 o’clock and at that point by the time we get out of the house it’s after 3 o’clock when other families are starting to wind down, so it’s left us where we rarely see any of our friends or do anything socially. When I got word that our friends were doing so much stuff without us, but my wife was just not telling me that we were invited to stuff it made me irate.

4. No sense of time my wife spends so much time on the most simplest task and overcomplicate absolutely everything where we just need to jump in the car to go grab some coffee. It takes an hour for her to get out of the house. I typically have myself and child ready Within 15 minutes and we’re just spending time waiting around for her to get ready.
And that just spreads through everything

My frustration is that she has no discipline. People can change, but yet she has no want or in her mind need to change and she has no drive to have that discipline to make a change so that we can actually get up in the morning as a family spend time together go hang out with our friends and go to events that are in the mornings And then nap time follows, and then we can go and do evening things since we’re already ready for the day. And it has killed me for so long that our child’s sleep schedule is so off compared to all the other children and that she just gets so cranky in the evenings that it frustrates all of us and stresses us out but yet I keep telling her that she needs a earlier bedtime and that would solve so many of our problems but yet my wife is selfishly choosing to be a night owl, and I’m starting to carry some resentment behind it

1n44ayz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n44ayz/knock_knock/,Knock Knock,"I’ve never really believed in anything supernatural. Ever since I was little I would always find logical explanations for everything that didn’t seem exactly right. So when I started hearing random knocking in my rundown apartment, I tried to find some logical way to explain it to myself.

I had just dropped out of college halfway through my second year because I couldn’t afford it anymore, when I moved out of my friend’s couch to a rundown apartment in the wrong side of town. There were always some shady people loitering around the lobby and the outside of the building. Sometimes I would see them quickly exchanging ziploc bags and rolled up cash. I always kept my distance from them for obvious reasons but I had my few encounters with crack heads.

One night after getting off work, I got a call from my girlfriend of two weeks asking if I wanted to hang out. I was tired from my job and my social battery was completely drained so I told her no and, in return, got a scoff and quick goodbye before she hung up. I was far too tired to care and tossed my phone onto the passenger seat.

When I arrived at the apartment building, I noticed a man sitting on the curb of the sidewalk next to the door of the building. I stole a quick glance at him as I got out of my car. He was wearing a dark brown jacket with tears down the sleeves and a raggedy jeans with all kinds of stains on them. His hair was unkept and dirty that matched the state of his fingernails. 

I previously thought the man was sleeping, mainly because his head was facing down, but not far down enough that I couldn’t see his eyes, which I couldn’t see any color in, so I assumed they were closed.

When I neared the door of the building, I took another glance at the man. He was no longer staring at the ground, but instead staring at me. Where you would expect to see his wide eyes, there was nothing. Just two dark voids where his eyes should be. I immediately stumbled and almost fell over. I blinked and when my eyes opened again, the man was back to staring at the ground.

I stared at him for a few moments before I shook my head and walked into the building. I had no desire to interact with the man and choked up at what I saw to me being tired.

The apartment I rented was on the fourth floor so the bumpy elevator ride didn’t take that long, which I was more than happy about because there was always an intense smell of rot coming from the floor of the elevator.

I fumbled with the key to my apartment and eventually got it into the keyhole and opened the door. My apartment was small and was basically one big room with a tiny hallway that led to a bedroom and bathroom. I threw my stuff down on the small coffee table and threw myself down on the couch and laid there staring up at the mildew that covered the ceiling in patches.

I felt myself drifting into sleep when a light knocking sound pulled me back to full consciousness. I sat up and stared at the door to my apartment, waiting for my visitor to knock again.

After a couple seconds another quiet knock sounded. I stood up and grudgingly walked over to the door. I glared through the peephole and stared into the hallway across the door. There was no one there.

I assumed I was ding dong ditched or something and cursed under my breath before walking back to the couch. I turned around and had only taken a single step from the door when I heard two quiet knocks again. My blood turned to ice. It came from in front of me. It wasn’t a knock on the door.

My eyes darted all across the apartment. From the couch, to the cracked window, to the small kitchenette in the corner. I took a couple more steps and faced my body towards the tiny hallway, half expecting to see someone standing there, but there was nothing.

I took another glance around the apartment before I made my way down the hallway. When I got to my bedroom door and lifted my hand to push the door open, as it was already slightly ajar, another knock sounded.

My head shot back to the living room area, as that was where I thought the sound came from. I quickly walked out of the hallway and spun around taking in the entire apartment. I search the entire apartment at least 3 times, completely turning everything upside down. By the time I finished, it was past midnight and I collapsed in exhaustion on my bed. 

I felt myself once again falling into sleep. Wanting to just rest, I kept telling myself that I was hearing things due to my tired mind. But something kept nagging in the back of my mind as I fell asleep. I felt that this was something more, something unnatural. The image of the eyes of the man in front of the building appeared in my dreams that night.",2,1756567276.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I had this issue with a previous Nespresso where the water dispensed with the pods was way too hot. I had noticed this overtime and even burned myself a few times sipping my coffee. Around the same time I had also noticed the taste of my pods significantly different, almost like way too acidic? I thought that the water temp being too hot likely caused a change in the coffee dispensed. 
I remember when I first got the machine the water seemed not hot enough and after research online I learned it’s to not compromise the quality of the taste of the pods. It was much more comfortable to drink when it was new. After much trouble shooting at home (descaling, manual/machine cleaning, factory resetting), I contacted support. They walked me through a bunch of possibilities to help, none of which did so. I was still within warranty so received a new machine. 
I am now having the same issue with this one many months later. At first the pods were perfect (like my last) and now the water is way too hot again and the taste of the pods is significantly different. I can’t even stomach them bc of how bad they taste now. Any help? Idk if it’s the water affecting the taste or if I need to run the cleaning cycle a million times to try to get all the residue out or try a factory reset? Any tips appreciated.

1. The curtains were left by the previous owner and I also think they are totally awful
2. Couch is brand new so I am not going to  change that
3. I would really prefer not to paint the walls

A few ideas I have:
1. Get a larger rug. This is 8x10 and I’m thinking 10x14 might better suit the room.
2. A different coffee table: either a square or more likely, a round table
3. The larger rug will allow for me to basically move the whole window away from the a window a bit
4. Add an accent chair

Everyday I come outside, I see and experience a lot of very disturbing stuff that shows utter disrespect to other people (fellow citizens and from immigrants toward citizens also). 

People here are very fond of going on the opposite lane just straight into you, mostly thinking you gonna move around them. People here don't stop before pedestrians when they cross a street, you can only hope for speed lowering, if you're lucky (some will not, which is against law), even then they will show you their impatience and you absolutely will be stressed. Not once I saw a parent driving their very small child without any protective/supportive gear. Dog owners will use the most transparent and thin leash possible, so that people around have chance to ride or go straight into it. Dog owners of small breeds won't use any leashes at all and won't teach their pet not to bark. Dog owners with huge scary dogs won't sometimes have leash too, but mostly don't use muzzle (we have law here, you have to use a leash and a muzzle for big dogs). People would let their small children eat food, icecream is their fave food choice, of course, on public transport. People will drink coffee in public transport in rush hour while carrying stuff and breathing into other person's neck. People in workplaces like shops won't do their jobs and are very upset when you tell them to go back to work (managers are not managing, cause workers are mostly migrants).

I don't go around people who go straight into me in my lane, I stop and I stare at them and make sure their hands and belogings are not touching me. I don't run in front of car, I make hand jestures to make sure that driver sees me and maybe make them stop (if I'm lucky) (some with show me finger for that). I do talk to dog owners with scared voice about leashes, muzzles, barking (cause I'm scared), doesn't matter. I do talk to people on public transport they can't eat or drink while they are here (it's at most 90 minutes in-town transit). I regularly send information about workers behavior in stores to their support/management via app.

Is it just me being an asshole demanding basic human respect and safety? How come a lot of people do that shit day in and day out and no one tells them anything? Why people do that shit anyway? And why I don't see anyone else demanding basic respect towards youselves? 

For context, those things and more were always there but after living in Europe, I just can't tolerate and be okay with that. Yes, there a a lot of people. Yes, we all are very stressed about money, politics and other stuff. Yes, NPD and other disorders are on the rise everywhere. BUT.

1n445a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1n445a7/experience_with_guest_houses/,Experience with Guest Houses?,"I had an unpleasant experience staying in someone's guest house recently. I had never been asked to stay in a guest house before. I just saw another post for a sit saying to stay in the guest house at the HO's property, and I'm thinking this is a red flag. But I'm basing this on a single experience. Weigh in?

In my experience, the guest house was not at all set up for comfortable living. It was more like a hotel room. It had a microwave and a hot plate, a teensy sink, no dish rack, no spices or oil or even salt. Also no table to eat at, just the couches and coffee table, or the yard but that was difficult for reasons I list below. 

(Edited to add: Some of this was communicated in the listing, some of it was not.)

The towels in the guest house bathroom also did not smell fresh. I can't say for sure but I think a prior guest may have used them and they didn't put out fresh ones. 

They also didn't put any back up toilet paper in the bathroom, just the one on the roll. Fortunately I had access to part of the main house to care for some smaller pets in tanks, and found more TP in the garage. 

I was locked out of most of the house and not able to take advantage of it. They even set it up to where an alarm would go off if the door past the garage -adjacent room with the small animals was opened/tampered with. 

Their guest house also required going up stairs (it was above a second garage) which made it harder to enjoy the elaborate yard. If I had been staying in the main house, it would have been easier to enjoy breakfast or tea in the yard. But as it was, I could not, because the dog could not be left alone for even a second. So I would have had to figure out a way to balance my food (no tray available) while walking a dog down stairs, and then open a gate which took two hands.  Not worth the trouble.

Many of the times that we went down to the yard for the dog to pee, she went to the door of the main house expecting to go back in to her actual house. So her routine was also disrupted as they had her staying in the guest house with me. 

Overall the situation reeked of classism to me. These people were clearly loaded and were sharing so much less in terms of accomodations than people I've sat for who had much less and shared everything they had. 

I have also sat in a couple fairly large homes where people did not do this, to be fair. #NotAllRichPeople. I think this was probably the biggest, fanciest one, though. 

They also didn't tell me that they weren't leaving until the day after I arrived until right before I got there. I guess they thought that since I had the guest house and they were in the main house it didn't matter. But I would have liked clearer communication.

I learned a lot from this sit about what my boundaries are as a sitter. I've had a lot of great sits in TH and this was the only one that really left a bad taste in my mouth. For the record, I did reflect my experience in my reviews. 

What is your experience staying in people's guest houses? Do you consider it a red flag?

I normally stay far away from these coffee things because I don't like coffee and they are way too early. Dew forms on your car as you drive there!!!

An older guy had just backed into the 2nd spot from an end and was finishing up getting out and everything.
I decided to back into the spot beside him.
There was also another end spot directly across from this one but that vehicle was a full size truck and was angled taking up the 2nd and 3rd spot.
So I was going to give ""special truck man"" his space and opted for the spot next to the car.

I think I saw him shake his head and almost throw his hands up in mild disgust when I started backing that way. Hmm
If he didn't want anyone parking on at least one side, why didn't he take the end spot???

I was only there for about 50 mins so likely no one used that spot after I left as 3 cars rolled out before I did.

The night before he was jogging beside my wobbly bike, big hands steadying the frame whenever I leaned too far. The next evening his chair at dinner was empty and his coat was gone from the hook by the door. Mom cried whenever I asked, so I learned to stop asking. For fifteen years the silence sat in me like a missing tooth, and I filled it with rumors about debts and secret lives.

Last month an unknown number lit up my phone. A woman said she had known my father and asked to meet. We sat in a tiny coffee shop with chipped mugs and sticky tables. Her name was Clara, and her hands shook around a warm cup. She told me he did not leave us. He was taken by his own mind. He had lived with severe depression and schizophrenia since before I was born, hid it out of shame, and one night wandered into the street in a break so deep he could not speak. Police brought him to a hospital, then to long term care. Mom kept it from us thinking she was protecting her kids until the secret became a wall.

Clara slid a shoebox across the table filled with letters he wrote to me and my sister but never sent. His handwriting was shaky but it was his. He said he hoped I was still riding, that he was proud, that he was sorry he could not be the father we deserved. I cried in that crowded shop and did not care who saw. I was angry at him for hiding, at Mom for silence, at myself for years of deciding he did not love us, and underneath all of it was grief for a man fighting his own brain.

Clara told me he had passed away two years earlier with our photo beside him. I never got to say goodbye, but those pages felt like a final conversation, his voice reaching across time. That night I pulled my old bike from the garage, dust thick on the frame, and rolled it into the sun. When I pedaled down the street I could almost feel big steady hands at my back again. It hurt and it also healed.

I am learning to forgive him for disappearing, and Mom for the silence, and myself for the story I told to survive. If you grew up with a hole shaped like a parent, I hope you get an answer that lets you breathe again. The truth does not erase the pain, but it gave me back my balance. TLDR: My dad did not abandon us when I was ten. He was sick, lived in care, wrote us letters he never sent, and passed away two years ago.

I live with my parents cause I'm still a minor for your info but with life and conditions I've matured into making most of my decisions on my own cause I've lived alone with 1 siblings since i was 8. So about 8-9 years. 

[Vent/story session i guess]


I went to the gym for 2 years, starting 3 years ago and i lost really good weight with my coach but my coach is a pro body builder so he went to this event outside my country so i went to a gym closer to me and worked out 3 days a week 2 hours+daily walks (same stuff i did with my coach). Things slowed down little by little but never stopped and my parents kept egging me and egging me to work out properly when i busted my ass working out until my legs were shaking and i could barely walk home. This went on for 9 months and the gym membership costed 8.5 dollars or so. I just decided i couldn't deal with them not appreciating what i did when i didn't do it for me but for them cause being honest I just don't care to do anything for myself, so i stopped. Schools started and academic stress hit me hard and i started to drink caffeine drinks (coffee, energy drinks etc) to cope i guess. Which is pretty harmless when others in my school do mushrooms, cigarettes, weed, etc and sometimes even in school. A few days ago my parents just started to put out their anger on me and started blaming me for every single thing food related in the house, blaming me for consuming caffeine, eating eggs every other day, etc (these are only things i did that i got blamed for they were belittling me for 15 mins straight) so now I'm in a spot where i don't even wanna do anything for or with them. But it's bruised my ego too much and i feel like i need to prove them wrong but i just can't find a door to go through to start again. I really really want to but if people get annoying with it i won't do it, It kills both the discipline and the motivation in me.

I assumed Joe was taking a private jet and would land sooner than later. He knew the hotel I had been staying at. If he got there and saw I wasn’t there, he’d break in and wait for me. He’d know I’d have to come back at some point. He’d wait for that moment and pounce.



Hours later, I rolled back into the hotel parking lot and turned off the car’s engine. I had burned through a half tank of gas just idling in a parking lot. The sun had slipped below the horizon, turning the brilliant, blinding blue sky to a muted purple. I stood outside my door, sighed, and turned the hand. 



Joe was inside, waiting for me to return.



“Joe,” I said, feigning surprise. “How long have you been here?”



“A while. Thankfully, the locks at this establishment aren’t too difficult to overwhelm.”



“Nothing but the best for us, right?” I said, laughing. I was the only one who chuckled.



Joe wasn’t alone. He was with those three I.A. agents. As always, they stood nearby and said nothing. Joe reached into a nearby briefcase and pulled out a manila envelope.



“I want you to know that you did great work down here. Your dedication to the details has not gone unnoticed. The higher ups were very pleased.”



“What did you find?” I asked. “Because I can’t imagine anything I provided you pointed to these people being aliens.”



“We were already certain,” Joe said, “but the birthday discrepancy clinched it. The birth certificate was a forgery. A good one, but fake. That lead me to assign a sneak and peak team to set up cameras in their house.”



“How?” I asked, stunned. “There was nothing in my reports that a court would see and sign off on.”



Joe laughed. “In the interest of national security and speed, we thought it best to not involve the courts. Logistically, it didn’t make too much sense.”



“That’s illegal.”



“We’re the government, Joe. We still have to follow the rules.”



“We’re the government,” he said, “we create the rules.”



“Jesus,” I said sighing. “This is so fucking illegal I can’t even wrap my head around it.”



“It’s only illegal if we get caught,” he said, eying me. “Do you want your dedication to bureaucratic red tape to be the reason these aliens have enough time to commit a devastating terrorist attack? Would you be able to sleep at a night knowing you could’ve stopped that, but chose not to?”



“But if we get caught,” I started.



Joe stopped me. “I don’t think that’s going to happen unless someone in this room talks.” Joe leaned forward and stared me dead in the eyes. “I’m not going to. Are you?” One of the I.A. agents subtly opened his jacket to reveal a weapon on his hip. The other two followed suit. 



The message was obvious.



“You, uh, said you had photos I should see?” I asked, changing the subject.



“Yes,” Joe said, breaking into a smile. “We caught them three of them in their natural forms. We assume the daughter is one as well, but we didn’t physically see her change.”



“Maybe Dawn’s not one of them?”



“She is. What’s the old expression? When there are three aliens at a table, and a human sits with them, there are four aliens at the table.”



“I don’t know that one.”



“It’s from the 40s,” he said, taking a glossy photo from the envelope. “Look. This one is the husband.”



He passed over a photo. It was from the Gonzalez family’s living room. I recognized it from my stakeouts. But the figure standing in the middle of the room wasn’t Raul. The creature was about four feet tall but his body had not rigidity. Its skin was blobby and comprised some kind of gel or slime. It glowed a faint yellow. The top of his head was ringed with half a dozen eyeballs that gave him a 360 degree view of his surroundings. 



“Is this real?”



“Yes.”



“No way,” I said.



“It’s true. And worse, this race is known to be quite violent. That’s why we want to shock them with a late night raid. They won’t expect it.”



“Violent?” I said, confused. 



“Very. When we raid the place tonight, they might be in this form. If so, be careful because that skin oozes a painful toxin that stings like hell and makes you black out. We found traces of it on some of the paperwork our sneak and peak team took from their home,” Joe said. “If we breach and they’re in their true bodies, do not engage. The I.A. agents have guns that will neutralize them. It’ll make them easier to handle and transport to their holding cells.”



“I’ve been sitting on these guys for weeks and haven’t seen them look anything like this. Is this some kind of test from the new bosses or something? Has to be, right?”



Joe shook his head no. “People don’t always show the public their true selves.”



“I’ve seen these people in their homes,” I pleaded. “When nobody could see them. When they let their hair down. They never even hinted at anything like this.”



“Some people don’t even show their true selves to themselves. Easier to live the lie,” Joe said. “We’ve discovered that if these aliens are around us long enough, they’ll mostly assimilate to their surroundings. Helps cover their tracks. Probably what you saw - their clever ruse.”



I stared down at the photos in bewilderment. Joe described the raid and why he chose me to lead it. I was half paying attention. My mind was on the Gonzalez family. They couldn’t be aliens, unauthorized or not. I’d seen them. I’d interacted with them. If they wanted to plunder the planet or kill all humans, why did Raul bother to save me? Why not let me die? One less man to kill during the invasion.



“Get some rest. We’ll be back in a few hours to prepare,” Joe said, before adding. “Don’t leave. We’ll have a man on the door, okay?”



They left. As soon as they did, I rushed to the toilet and threw up. I sat by the toilet for hours, not wanting to move. My heart thudded in my chest as I watched the hands of the clock spin. The raid was going down at one in the morning. Joe had assured me that the extraction would be quick. It had to be. You didn’t want witnesses to the snatch and grab. You didn’t want loose ends.



At twelve thirty, they returned. We geared up and went over the plans one last time. I put on a bulletproof vest, padded gloves, and shielded riot helmet. I held a locked and loaded rifle but knew in my heart I wouldn’t need it. These people had no weapons - I’d checked during my investigation. I’d never seen them even raise their voice, let alone fire a weapon. I didn’t think they were violent, despite what Joe insisted. 



Joe pulled a white box truck around and me and the three I.A. agents climbed in. From the outside, this looked like a used U-Haul truck. They had transformed the inside into a mobile command center. I sat next to the kitted out I.A. agents and stared at the empty bench across from us. As we drove, the handcuffs attached to the wall gently swayed.



The I.A. agents weren’t chatty, even with each other. They never even looked at me. Each held a weapon resembling my rifle, but modified to fire an unknown projectile. I assumed these were the “neutralizers” Joe had mentioned. They had other gear that looked foreign to me, but I knew I’d never find out what they were. Even if I asked, these guys were as silent as mannequins.



I peered through the windshield to get a sense of where we were. As I did, we turned down the street where the Gonzalez family lived. Joe pulled the van over and cut the lights. He tapped on a tablet and all the lampposts that lined the street shut off one by one. We were in total darkness now.



Joe eased off the brake, and we inched down the road. My stomach was churning and my arms felt heavy. It felt like I had ginger ale in my brain. This was wrong. Everything felt off. Rushed with bad intel. I thought about objecting, but couldn’t bring myself to do it. Who would even listen? Speaking up wouldn’t matter. They wanted this done. 



Joe brought the van to a halt outside the house. We waited in silence. During my time with the agency, I’d done tons of raids. I usually felt excited because I knew we were about to bust a bad guy. Take them off the street. Keep the neighborhood safe. This time, though, all I felt was a creeping dread.



The doors swung open and Joe stood there. He nodded at us and pointed at the Gonzalez’s house. It was go time. The three beefy I.A. agents got out and silently duck-walked to the front door. I tried to get my legs to listen, but they were stuck to the floor.



“Get moving,” Joe said. “You have a job to do.”



I nodded and willed my legs to cooperate. Before I knew it, I had joined the I.A. agents at the front door. The entire neighborhood was quiet at this hour. Nobody’s lights were on. There wasn’t a soul expecting us. Phantoms haunting the night. Monsters outside your door. 



I looked at the door and sighed. This was it. The culmination of my first new assignment. I swallowed hard, looked over at the I.A. agents, and gave a nod. The three of them swung a battering ram at the front door. It splintered after the second swing, and we swarmed into the house, weapons drawn.



“This is the Office of Executive Orders! We have a warrant for your arrest! Come out with your hands up!” I yelled.



The previously silent house buzzed awake. From the master bedroom, I heard Maria scream for her children. Seconds later, she came bolting out of the room in nothing but a nightgown. She didn’t even give us a look as she sprinted past, trying to save her children. 



But that was not to be. One of the I.A. agents reached out and snagged her at the waist. She nearly spun out, but the agent’s hand grabbed her nightgown and tore it. It fell to the ground, exposing her, but she didn’t stop fighting. She threw a punch and tried to squirm away, but the agent’s grip was too firm.



 She screamed for her kids to run. To hide. She screamed like a banshee in both English and Spanish, but it didn’t matter. We’d breached the barrier. We were in charge now, and the clock was ticking. She screamed again, but a gun barrel to her face shut her up. The I.A. agent clicked his handcuffs tight on Maria’s hands, shackling her. He put a black hood over her face and sat on her body. She wasn’t going anywhere.



Raul came out rushing out of the room with a baseball bat. He swung wildly at anyone near him and caught me in the gut. The vest I was wearing took some of the blow, but I still had the wind knocked out of me. I stumbled back and crashed into the wall. Family portraits tumbled to the ground and sent bits of shattered glass flying around. As I was struggling to suck in air, another I.A. agent pounced on Raul and wrestled away the bat. Seconds later, agents handcuffed, hooded, and placed him next to Maria.



“Mom! Dad! What’s happening?!” It was Eddie. His eyes were wide. Fear radiated through his tiny body. His fists balled up, and he rushed for the man squatting near his parents. He never reached them. 



The remaining I.A. agent snatched the boy from the ground and held him in a bear hug. Raul screamed for the man to leave his son alone. Eddie kicked and punched, but his blows did little damage. Like the others, Eddie was cuffed and masked. From under the hood, Raul screamed curses and threats as his son’s body was roughly tossed next to him. He promised he’d kill us all. It was all a big nothing. The Gonzalez family’s gig was up.



Joe came into the house and saw the three Gonzalez family members locked down. He turned his attention to me, still sprawled out on the ground, and marched over. He got in my face. I could smell the coffee on his breath. “Find the girl! Now! We’re running out of time!”



I scrambled back to my feet. My chest was killing me, but I knew I had to find Dawn, and fast. The longer this raid went on, the more likely someone would hear something. We didn’t want to attract a crowd. Crowds get rowdy. Considering how these I.A. agents had acted on this raid, they’d respond in kind.



Then shit would go really off the rails. I had to stop that from happening. I had to ensure no innocent bystanders got caught in any crossfire. If I failed, there would be blood in the streets. A lot of it.



I burst into Dawn’s room. Pictures of horses and pop stars covered the walls. Her bed was empty. I felt around anyway, in case she was hiding under the covers. She wasn’t. I dropped to the floor to see if she had wedged under the bed, but, again, no dice. I turned and saw the closed closet door. 



I heard whimpering.



I stood and opened the door. It was Dawn. She stood, not really hiding because there was nowhere to go. Fear had paralyzed her. She clutched an old, one-eyed teddy bear to her chest. Tears streamed down her face. Her whole body trembled. Without realizing it, she urinated down her leg. 



“It’s okay,” I said, trying to keep my voice measured. “I’m here to….”



I felt a hand grab my shoulder and yank me back. It was one of the I.A. agents. I fell to the ground hard and landed on something that dug into my back. I rolled over and pulled out a horse figurine. Its four legs had snapped off from the impact.



Without saying a word, the I.A. agent scooped up Dawn and slung her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. She screamed and kicked, but he didn’t loosen his grip. She yelled, her small voice cracking. Maria, Raul and Eddie screamed to her, but I heard a boot meet a body and the screams silenced. As the I.A. agent got to the living room, I heard another set of handcuffs click.



 “Get’em to the van!” Joe yelled from the living room.



I stood, my legs wobbly, and made my way out of Dawn’s room. It was so dark in there. Or maybe it was the edges of my vision blackening from stress. I could hear the blood whooshing in my ears. My heart pounding like it was trying to escape. My head was fizzy, like shaken up soda. Bubbling and distorting the clarity of my thoughts. If it wasn’t for the adrenaline, I would’ve passed out. But the little voice in my head told me to move.



I stumbled into the living room. The last remaining I.A. agent dragged a screaming Dawn out of the house. I realized I was still holding the broken horse figurine. Its black eyes looked at me and I could feel the sorrow in its gaze. I felt that pull in my gut again. The churn. I felt bile rising in my throat, but swallowed it back down. 



The only two people left inside were Joe and I. We locked eyes. I felt the urge to vomit again. His face beamed with pride.



“These monsters will be the downfall of this country,” he said. “Possibly the world, if we let them.”



“They didn’t use their toxin,” was what came tumbling out of my mouth. My tongue was dry and heavy in my mouth. My head buzzed. This didn’t feel real. Had to be a dream. If it was, maybe I could wake up to a world that still made sense.



“Come on, I saw a neighbor’s light turn on.” We started to leave, but Joe stopped and turned to me. “You did great work here. Well done.”



He ran out to the van. I took one last look at the now turned over living room. A place I saw these people sit and laugh and love. A place that radiated a joy you could feel from the other end of your binoculars. A home. 



Where I had crashed into the wall was now a graveyard of broken glass, bent frames and damaged family photos. Moments caught in time that reflected a promising past. A dream unrealized. My eye found a family portrait of the Gonzalez family standing in front of the Alamo. Smiles wide, the kids giving bunny ears to their parents, tiny hands clutching souvenirs. Dawn was holding a horse figurine.



I felt the figure in my hand and I swear it felt hot to the touch. Like a relic from an ancient tribe I wasn’t supposed to handle. Wasn’t worthy enough to handle. I squatted and placed it next to the picture. Another broken object laid to rest. The house and everything in it had changed. Worsened. All that remained was a hollowed out husk.



A neighbor yelling in Spanish outside caught my attention. I needed to leave. I ran out of the house and straight toward the van. Around me, lights in all the surrounding houses started turning on. They’d see us now. They’d discover what happened to their neighbors. Their friends. If they didn’t already, they’d fear us now. We were the unauthorized ones here.



Joe frantically waved at me to get into the van. As I got to the rear doors, I felt my churning stomach finally reach its breaking point. I lifted my visor and a stream of yellow bile exploded from my mouth, splashing onto the street. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and climbed into the van. Joe slammed the doors behind me.



A minute later, the van rocketed down the street. Away from the house. Away from the chaos. I glanced down at my watch. It had only been ten minutes. It felt like ten years. The only noise I heard as we drove away was a dog barking. 



Inside the van, the Gonzalez family sat huddled close together on the opposite side of the I.A. agents and myself. Their handcuffs shackled to the wall. The hoods were still on their heads. The kids were sobbing, and Maria tried to calm them down in Spanish. It wasn’t working. You could hear the terror in her voice. Raul just kept repeating, “How is this legal? We have rights.”



I stared down at the floor. I tried to block out the noise but was having as much success as Maria was in calming down her kids. Without saying a word, an I.A. agent reached across and plucked hoods off them one by one. He tossed them at my feet. I stared up at him, hate in my eyes. He knew I didn’t want to see this. He didn’t care. Cruelty was the point.



Raul looked at his family and tried to calm them down. Tears fell from his eyes and landed on the floor of the van. The puddle grew with each drop. Raul looked over at us and I turned away.



“My fucking wife is naked!” he yelled. “What kind of animals are you?!”



“Daddy,” Dawn sobbed. “What’s going on?”



“At least give my wife something to cover up with. This is barbaric, man! Be a good person here.”



“I don’t want anything from these people,” Maria spat. “Let them see what they did. Let it haunt them.” She spit at our feet and cursed us in Spanish.



 I’d been on raids with guys who were a little too gung-ho about the job, but this was worse than that. These I.A. agents weren’t bothered. They just sat there, staring off into the middle distance. They didn’t care. For them, the raid and humiliation of the Gonzalez family was as normal and boring as drinking a mug of coffee in the morning. 



It made my skin crawl.



Raul sensed their disinterest, as well. He turned his gaze to me. I could feel his eyes on me. I glanced over for only a second, but it was enough for his memory to kick into gear. “Hey, you were the guy at the restaurant the other day. I did the Heimlich on you.”



“I don’t know what you’re….”



“Don’t give me that. You were. I saved your life, man! What are you doing? My family is innocent. Are you ICE? FBI? CIA? Who are you with? We didn’t do anything! My kids, bro? You grabbed my kids?!”



I swallowed hard. This didn’t feel right. I’ve done raids. I’ve caught criminals. This didn’t feel like that. This made me feel like, like, I was the bad guy here. But that couldn’t be the case. If Joe and the higher ups knew these were dangerous aliens, maybe they were. I wouldn’t have done this if I didn’t trust them, right?



I’m a good person.



“Listen, bro, listen. My kids were born in Texas. They’re American citizens. You gotta let them go. My wife, too. If you need to take someone, take me. I came over with my parents when I was 13. If you gotta send someone back, just make it me.”



“Raul, quiet,” Maria said. “We need a lawyer. Don’t speak to these animals.”



“Just take me, bro. Please,” Raul said. I looked up, and we locked eyes. He had tears welling up. His face was pleading with me. “My kids are innocent. My wife, too. Just take me, okay? I’ll go willingly. Please, bro. Please. Have a heart, man. We’re both human.”



One of the I.A. agents scoffed at that. Raul turned his rage to him. “You’re a fucking monster, bro! I hope your family suffers from your sins. I hope you….”



The I.A. agent pulled up his gun and flipped a switch. On the side of the weapon, a series of multi-colored lights illuminated and the internal battery quickly charged up. The noise echoed off the walls of the rocking van. Everyone went silent. The I.A. agent powered down the gun. I looked away and pretended I was back in my DC office chasing down real criminals.



Ten minutes later, the van came to a stop. We’d arrived at the black site jail. Joe hadn’t been lying - this place looked like a warehouse. The only difference was this place had fences tipped with razor wire, top of the line alarm system, and security cameras crammed into every nook and cranny of the place.



The back door swung open. Joe was stunned to see the unmasked Gonzalez family’s faces. He saw the pile of hoods at my feet and shot me an annoyed look. “They’re not supposed to see any of this! Get out, now,” he spat.



I stood like a newly born fawn, but found my footing and hopped out. The I.A. agent next to me climbed out after. He towered over me. It brought me back to my middle school days, where I was the smallest kid in my grade. This was the first time I felt small in years.



“We’re going to uncuff you from the wall. If you try to run or scream or do any other nonsense, it will not go well for you or your family. Understood?”



The Gonzalez family nodded. An I.A. agent reached over and undid the wall shackles. He nodded at the opening at the end of the van, but nobody moved. 



“Get going,” Joe said to the Gonzalez family.



Despite the warning, Raul protested. The I.A. agent backhanded him hard across the face. That got the family moving. Eddie, Dawn, Maria and Raul did as they were told and hopped out. The last two I.A. agents took up the rear.



We escorted the Gonzalez family past the razor wire fences and into the facility. I was expecting to find a well lit, secured modern prison. That wasn’t the case. It was dark and empty inside. If there were other guards there, they didn’t make themselves seen. The only light in the building came from a line of overhead lamps leading down a hallway to a locked door. They cast small halos on the cold cement floor.



The door at the end of the hall had “Restricted Access” stenciled across it. I turned away from the Gonzalez family. Their looks hurt my heart. I watched as Joe walked up to a small number pad and typed in a code. The door depressurized with a hiss and popped open. I went to open it wide, but Joe grabbed my hand.



“You aren’t authorized.”



“What?” I said, confused. “We’re taking them to their cells.”



“You aren’t authorized,” he said. He nodded at the I.A. agents. “They are. Stand down.”



“Mom, where are they taking us?” Dawn asked, her voice shaky.



“Are they going to kill us?” Eddie said, tears filling his eyes.



“They don’t do that here, papa,” Raul said, training his gaze on me. “They don’t do that here, right?”



“Right,” I croaked out. “It’s just a holding cell.”



The I.A. agent pushed me aside and swung the door open. He nodded for the Gonzalez family to go inside. Eddie didn’t move. His legs had stopped working. The I.A. agent held up his weapon. 



“It’s okay, papa,” Raul said to his son. “I’m right behind you, okay? I’m right here. We’re going to get through this together. Okay. I love you, papa. I love you always and forever. We’re gonna be okay.”



That seemed to do the trick. Eddie started walking, and the procession continued into the unknown. As Maria passed me, she spit onto my visor and swore at me in Spanish. The I.A. agent shoved her forward. Raul looked at me, too. I could tell he wanted to say something, but the words died in his throat. 



“It’s a holding cell,” I said, softly. “That’s all.”



His eyes were bloodshot, and his cheeks were wet with tears. He nodded and joined his family in the darkness. The door closed behind him with a pressurizing thunk. 



Joe patted me on my shoulder. “You’re a good person,” he said. “This country could use more men like you. Come on, let’s go debrief.”



We turned to leave, our footsteps echoing in the warehouse. We had reached the exit when I heard Dawn shriek. The rest of the Gonzalez family joined it. The fear in their wailing cut through me like a knife. I snapped my head to the door and back to Joe. He shrugged his shoulders. “The bad guys are being processed.”



I balled up my hand and landed a haymaker across Joe’s nose. It crunched under my fist. Blood exploded from the blow. He went crashing to the ground in a heap, out cold. I ran to the number pad and my fingers flew across the numbers. The door hissed opened again. I whipped the door open and ran inside.



I got about five feet and collapsed to the ground. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was a nightmare come to life. The three I.A. agents had shed their clothes and ditched their weapons. They weren’t government agents. They weren’t even men. 



“Jesus Christ,” I mumbled.



Standing in the middle of the room were three softly glowing yellow creatures with a ring of eyes around the top of their heads.



One of them had Dawn in their mouth. It was devouring her whole. She screamed from inside the creature’s maw, but there was nothing that could be done. She was sliding deeper into the creature’s gullet. Raul tried to run to his little girl, but a touch from the aliens stopped him in his tracks. His eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out. The toxin worked quickly.



The creature touched Maria and Eddie, silencing their screams. One creature shuffled toward me, leaving a luminescent slime trail behind them. It looked down at me disapprovingly with several of its eyes. It shook its head and raised an arm to touch me. Before it could, a voice cut through the dark.



“No! Leave him.” I looked back. It was Joe. “He’s one of the good ones. He just needs some reeducation is all. We can save him.”



The creature put down its glowing arm and slimed back to the Gonzalez family. It was his turn to feed. He wrapped his sticky arms around Maria’s naked body and raised her above its cavernous mouth.



I felt the barrel of a rifle dig into my side. Joe and I looked at each other. His nose was flat and black bruising had rung around his eyes. “Stand up. We’ve got to get you back to DC for debriefing.”



“Were they even aliens?” I asked.



Joe sighed. “I can tell you, but then you’ll have to join them,” he said, thumbing over at the passed out Gonzalez family. “Or, you can trust that I’m being honest and you can keep your job? You can only do one.”



I stood and glanced over at the remaining Gonzalez family members. They looked peaceful on the ground. Slumbering. A cool chill ran down my spine. I turned away as Maria disappeared into the creature’s belly and met Joe’s gaze.



“You have proof, right? To show me?”



“Yes.”



My mind raced. Raul had broken the law, right? He came here illegally. He admitted that himself. These creatures, as strange as they were, must work for the government. Maybe I didn’t understand it now, but I might later when they fill me in.



There had to be a greater purpose to all this. Otherwise, this would just be cruel. And cruelty wasn’t ever the point to our work. We hunt bad guys. We keep people safe.



“Which is it?” Joe asked.



Joe was a dick, and these creatures were vile, but somewhere below that, they must have a sense of honor. A sense of duty. A sense of pride. Surely, they heard the same righteous, patriotic call I heard before I signed up. A desire to catch the bad guys and keep us all safe. If I was one of the good guys and they worked with me, they had to be good guys, too. Right?



Had to be.



Because I’m a good person.



I’m a good person.

1n43xr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n43xr4/the_monday_man/,The Monday Man,"In Peoria, Illinois, there resides a strange fellow the locals call “the Monday Man.” He lives in a small blue house with yellow trim, a dark brown door, and a front porch surrounded by white painted wood railings that have seen better days. Once dismissed as a crazy recluse, he is now considered an irreplaceable legend. 


For over thirty years, every single day, a man wearing a thinning but clean yellow robe, green plaid pajama pants, and off-white slippers steps out of his front door at 9:15 in the morning. Holding a steaming cup of what is assumed to be coffee, he gently smiles, leans on the side of his front door frame, its paint slightly rubbed off from this daily habit, and raises his blue cup to everyone that crosses his path.


And he always says the words, and only these words: 


“Mondays, am I right?” 


He says it with a kind gleam in his eyes to every jogger, neighbor heading to work, college student taking a shortcut, and kid heading to a friend’s house. No matter their gender, status, or where they are going, he does not discriminate. Somehow, those words transform into whatever that individual needs to hear, and his voice warms them like a gentle hug.


Blue mug in hand, regardless of the day, month, or year. No matter the weather. 


“Mondays, am I right?” 


The brief period between 9:15 and 9:45 in the morning is the only time he is ever seen. The public has accepted that the man with the kind eyes and bright blue coffee cup will never join them on their walks.


There is one person in particular who has found greater meaning in the Monday Man’s strange routine: a recently retired postal worker named Tom Whitaker, age seventy-two.


“It’s comforting, in a way,” Whitaker told his next-door neighbor, standing next to his beige Ford Taurus, gazing thoughtfully at nothing. “You can count on the Monday Man. Like the sun rising and setting. He’ll be there.”


Whitaker spent forty years working through snow, rain, blistering heat, sunshine, and cloudy days, never missing a day of thankless work. When he retired, he tried to find new hobbies. It was difficult, with bad knees, shaky hands, and cloudy vision. But the Monday Man’s daily routine has given him something to look forward to and take comfort in.


“It’s like how I was at my old postal job. Routine. It makes me smile. Every morning, without fail. Rain, snow, global pandemics, the Monday Man’s got that mug. Sometimes I like to think, because he always calls whatever day of the week it is, the most difficult weekday for most people... it’s like he’s carrying the weight of all our Mondays, all our worries, on his shoulders. I think maybe that’s what he’s trying to say. Does that make sense?”


His neighbor nodded again, smiled, and said goodnight, leaving him with his thoughts.


The next day, at 9:20 in the morning, Whitaker stepped out next to his car, yellow coffee cup in hand. The Monday Man was leaning against his door, as always. He lifted his blue mug and kindly said: 


“Mondays, am I right?”


Whitaker, beaming with quiet understanding, nodded back, as though sharing in a deep, unspoken truth that only the two of them could understand.",11,1756566389.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I do good things in my community. I hand out turkeys at Thanksgiving and support poor families at Christmas. I volunteer at my kid’s school. I always remember people’s birthdays and anniversaries. I hold doors open for strangers. I love my country. I love my family. I help keep us all safe and ask nothing in return. 



They lied to me. They lied to us all. This happened in my department, but there’s a good chance it’s happening to every department. The poison has seeped into the bones of government. It’s rotting from the inside out.



Before I spill my guts, I need you to understand that I never intended for any of this to happen. 



I swore an oath to follow the law and serve the public. Had I known about the fallout from my last job, I would’ve never done what they had me do. None of the agents had any say in the matter. We were just following orders. If we hadn’t, they would’ve done worse to us. If I didn’t witness it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t be able to tell you about it today.



I want to give details, but I can’t. If they ever found this document, my entire family might be in danger. Not just my immediate family, either. These guys go deep. Second cousins deep. Long-lost auntie deep. They’d all be sacrificed for my deeds. I don’t want to put any of my people in harm’s way. I care for others because I’m a good person. 



You’d do the same, too.



Suffice to say, I work for the government. All I can say is that my division is under the purview of the Justice department. We do top level investigative work. I’ve been there for over a decade and have been a model employee. The highest authorities in my division have praised my work. Instructors in the department’s training program use several of my previous cases as examples of pitch-perfect investigation. At its core, we’re the good guys tasked with taking out the bad guys.  



Recently, major changes came to our division. Or, in legalese, our division had been “reclassified.” There was no warning. It happened overnight. The news didn’t even report on the radical change. It just happened with zero push back. Why? Because the order came from the top. The tippy top, if you catch my meaning. 



Within three days, everything at the leadership level of our division changed. My boss, the man who basically wrote the book on proper modern investigation techniques, was out. This man was beloved by every person in our office. Jesus, he had served as an officiant at more than one of my co-worker’s weddings! 



In his place was an outsider with a limited grasp on what we actually did on a day-to-day basis. I’ll call him Joe (not his real name). On the day of his appointment, he sent out a three sentence email to everyone in the division. It read: “(My old boss) has retired after nearly 35 years of excellent service. With this move, management will restructure the division to align with the current administration’s desires. We look forward to meeting and evaluating you all in the coming days.” 



It did not inspire confidence in the team.



The following day, we all crammed into the conference room to hear our new leader speak. We were a normally chatty bunch, but the room was as silent as a church. Everyone fidgeted in their seats. Or rolled papers in the hands. Or picked at their cuticles. Anything to leach the stress out of their body.



Joe arrived five minutes late - something our previous boss would never do - and didn’t even greet us. He just started talking as soon as he entered. Like his email, it lacked any spark of confidence. He was brief, but brutal. Without so much as a sympathetic look or consoling phrase, he took a Katana to our morale and left our spirits to fall apart.



In short, he informed us that the directives for our division had changed. He expected us to comply. If we felt we couldn’t, they offered us a three-month severance. He waited to see if anyone would bite. When all hands stayed low, he told us we’d be doing the same type of work we’d always done, but our targets would be changing. He didn’t elaborate on what that meant.



Joe also informed us that the department had become too bloated. Cuts would be necessary to keep us afloat and bring in the division’s budget. Since no one had volunteered for early retirement, Joe would evaluate our roles and determining who was expendable. The reviews would start that day and be over by the end of the week. He said about twenty percent of the staff would be axed. Maybe more. That phrase made everyone’s ulcers activate in unison.



Lastly, Joe informed us that agents could no longer make their own cases. The tip lines were shutting down. Only cases and targets from the management team would receive approval. Joe warned that anyone caught “coloring outside the lines” would be fired. No warnings. No second chances. No severance. Fired.



Joe left right after and holed up in his new office. As soon as he was out of earshot, the entire conference room exhaled. We knew changes were coming, but this felt like a purge. To what end was still unclear. After we collected our jaws from the floor, we filed out of the room in the saddest procession this side of an assassinated president’s funeral. 



A couple of us gathered in the kitchenette to drink some shitty coffee and speculate. The first question everyone seemed to have was “who the hell was Joe?” Where had he come from? Why was he given this post? Was he even qualified to lead this division? Nobody had ever heard of or seen this guy before. 



One of our ace internet researchers said he’d look into Joe and try to find some answers. In the modern era, there was always an electronic trail. I’d used this researcher on jobs in the past and knew how deep he could dig. If Joe had a trail, he’d find it. We all agreed with this course of action. It wasn’t much, but any information might make steering these waters easier.



The next day, our researcher came in, head hung low. Joe was a ghost. Anything from his past had been scrubbed from existence. Our man couldn’t find any information about him. Just nada. It was like Joe had been grown in a lab to be a government toady. Most of us doubted if Joe was even his real name.



This new information solidified the consensus was that Joe was probably under-qualified quisling hired because of fealty and nothing more. Knowing that our old boss would have pushed back on the changes, the higher ups brought in their own ghoul to scare us into compliance. Joe was the masked executioner, come to ply his trade. We left our little conclave with more questions than answers. 



A day later, my phone buzzed. It was time for my interview.



The day of my interview was surreal. I was called into Joe’s office and armed guards escorted me in. That was not standard practice. A dour-looking Joe greeted me. He told us he was 34, but he looked about 50…a rough 50 at that. His armed guards stayed in the office with us as Joe pulled out my files.



“You’ve been here for quite some time, yes?” Joe asked.



“Yeah,” I said, before turning to the guards. “Umm, those files contain a lot of classified information.”



“They’re fine,” Joe said dismissively.



“Who do they work with?”



“The division I now run.”



“Okay,” I said, unsure of that response.



“You have an impressive track record. A lot of closed cases. Difficult ones.”



“I had an excellent mentor.”



“Now that he’s retired, you can mentor someone yourself.”



“Might be hard. Seeing as there are cuts coming. I’d hate to start with someone just to see them leave.”



I knew I shouldn’t have said that, but I figured if I was on the chopping block already, might as well go down swinging. If I wasn’t, well, I was sure leadership could overlook a snippy retort. Even if they took offense and let me go, I had skills that would be valuable in the private sector. It would suck - I took a job with the government because I believe in our country and consider myself a patriot - but I knew I had places I could go. I wouldn’t starve.



“How do you feel about the direction the division is taking?”



“Hard to say without knowing exactly where we are going.”



“Would you agree there is bloat and waste here?”



I didn’t answer right away. I was sure there was some bloat. Every governmental agency had something they could trim. But I also knew that proper funding was necessary for the work we do around here. Crime found cracks in society and we had to fill those cracks. It wasn’t free, but it felt like a necessity. Governments are supposed to care for its citizens after all. Felt weird to put a number on the safety of the country. 



Still, I wanted to stay. “Sure,” I said. “We can nip and tuck in some places.”



“Do you mind opening the office door for a moment?”



My face screwed up in confusion. “Do you want me to leave?”



He shook his head. “Just open the door.”



I sighed, stood, and walked to the door. I looked back at Joe and then opened the door. I waited for him to call out or another man to enter. Neither thing happened. Joe nodded, jotting something down in my file. “You can close it now.”



I let out a nervous chuckle and closed the door. I returned to my seat, more confused than did the first time I sat down for this meeting. Joe smiled.



“How do you feel about the president?”



“The people elected him,” I said.



“Did you?”



“I don’t bring politics into the job, sir. If it’s all the same to you.”



“Very well,” Joe said. “Do you serve at the pleasure of the president?”



“I serve the people of the country and that includes the president.”



“Interesting,” he said. “What can you tell me about the Berrios case?”



The Berrios case was a dog from the minute it landed on my desk. We had a confidential informant that heard about this fast rising drug guy named Julio Berrios. He was making waves near the border. Messing with the order of things in the criminal world. In the division, we called criminals like that “chaos agents.” It’s hard to keep a bead on them. They can go either way. 



Rumor had it Berrios had united a few disparate syndicates into a new cartel. Besides messing with the established powers along the border, they were making plays in the US. Our informant said he knew someone in the Berrios organization that would work with us. We met with the guy, got the green light to sign him up, and set him to work. 



A week later, Mexican authorities found his body in front of the American consulate. Berrios had skinned him alive. It was a black eye for our division and we caught hell for the operation. I’d been opposed from the jump - the new informant seemed squirrely to me - but the orders came on from high. I went along and suffered the consequences.



“We made the best decisions with the information we had at the time,” I said. “Sometimes, cases go sideways. Berrios went sideways.”



“I see. Do you think this informant was a double agent?”



I nodded. “That was our thinking. He may have been using us to climb the ranks, but Berrios saw him as a threat to his power.”



“What did the agency do to get revenge?”



“Sir?”



“Surely you and your fellow agents plotted revenge against either Berrios or your initial informant.”



“Sir, we rarely trade in vengeance in this job.”



“But did you want to get revenge?”



I paused. I mean, human nature says yes, but we’re not beasts in the jungle anymore. You can’t potentially ruin a massive case because you’re angry someone did you dirty. “I wanted justice to be served. That said, my personal feelings don’t figure into it. If the higher ups say let it lay, I let it lay.”



“I see. Didn’t they also tell you to go ahead with the opp. Even after you had doubts?”



“That’s the way the system works, sir.”



“So it does,” he said, glancing at my file again.



“We’ve made some good progress with Berrios though. I think with a little time and support, we could….”



“Can you hand me that mug of coffee?” Joe interrupted. The mug was a mere two inches from his outstretched arm. He could easily grab it if he wanted. We shared a glance. He gave me another of his curious small smiles. 



Like with the door, I was confused. “Are you expecting me to get you a fresh cup or…?” I asked.



“Just hand me that mug.”



I waited a beat to see what Joe would do. When he did nothing, I decided this was dumb, and handed him the mug. Joe nodded and placed the mug back down. He didn’t even take a sip. He closed my file and put it away.



“We have a meeting tomorrow at 0500 in conference room A. Don’t be late. You’re free to go.”



My eyebrows knitted in confusion. It felt like the wind had been knocked out of my lungs. After all the buildup and looming threats about losing my job, this was the whole interview? His armed guards moved towards me, so I stood up. They stayed in place. I looked down at Joe and shook my head. “The meeting is over? Just like that?”



Joe nodded. “Found out what I needed. Congratulations. You’re staying around for a while.”



The next morning, I entered conference room A with a warm cup of coffee in my hand and a knot in my stomach. I found a handful of agents - all men - sitting there. Some of them I knew. Some were from different departments within the division. The three hulking men surrounding Joe were new to every set of eyes in the room. In the middle of this newly slimmed down organization was Joe, fake looking smile plastered on his mannequin looking face.



“You all are still around because we determined you were the best at your jobs. You understand how the organization runs and can handle any task handed to you. With my guidance, you all will flourish in this new opportunity.”



The old guard all squirmed in their seats a little. Joe was laying it on a little thick. That wasn’t unexpected. When a new dog comes to the park and wants to let everyone know they’re in charge, they piss on everything and do a lot of barking. Joe was playing his part.



“That said, I’m sure you have a lot of questions,” Joe said, “But before we get into those, I want to assure you that your jobs are not changing in any noticeable way. You’re still tracking down bad guys. You’re still putting the bracelets on them. You’re still ensuring justice is served. It’s just that the targets are, well, different. Craig, the lights.”



The lights shut off in the room and a photo carousel whirred to life. Joe pressed a button and the blank slide gave way to a new one. It was our new division name and insignia. We were now “The Office of Executive Orders (OEO)” and our logo was a uniformed wizard shooting lightning at some unseen foe.



A click and a new slide appeared. Across the top, it read “Operation Merlin” and below that was the phrase “Make them all disappear.” I glanced around the room and a few of us caught each other’s eyes. Without a word between us, we had a conversation. The long and short of our befuddled looks were, “this seems fucked up.”



Joe clicked the button again. There was a picture of what looked like a UFO flying over Washington DC at night. The date said it was last Wednesday. It was the clearest picture of a supposed UFO I’d ever seen. It was saucer shaped with rows of multi-colored lights. There was some kind of writing - or what looked like writing, anyway - along the side. It was in a language I’d never seen before.



“This is one of the many recent UAP sightings we’ve tracked since January.” 



“UAP?” one of my colleagues asked.



“Unidentified aerial phenomenon, previously called UFOs. Most have landed near our southern border, but a few of the UAP were spotted near DC, New York, Los Angeles, and the Oak Ridge nuclear facility.”



“Is this a joke?” a brave coworker asked, half laughing. 



“No. No more interruptions, please.” Joe said sternly. He continued, “We have good reason to believe that these crafts have not only been flying within our airspace, but also landing beings within our borders.”



He let that sit with us for a beat. He was talking about little green men. I had to stifle a laugh. I wasn’t the only one. 



Joe went on. “The belief is there’s hostile intent with these landings. This comes straight from the top. The idea of a full scale invasion is not off the table, gentlemen.”



A few of us broke and laughed. This had to be a big joke. But Joe’s angry face stopped the laughter. He was serious. The room went quiet again. Joe hit the next slide. There were several photos of different ethnic families taking part in wholesome activities together. 



“These look like ordinary American citizens, correct?” Everyone murmured in agreement. “Wrong,” Joe said. “Our internal team has identified each of these families as spies from beyond the stars.”



“You’re talking about aliens? From space?” someone said.



“Unauthorized aliens, yes.”



“Are there authorized aliens?” someone else asked.



Joe stayed silent. We got our answer. It sucked out of the room. If this was real, how long had this been going on? Who knew about it? Why were we just now learning about this?



“As I said, our internal team had helped to identify several groups that have come here illegally.”



“Internal team?” I asked. “Who do they work for?”



“That is not required knowledge for you to do your jobs.” Joe nodded to the three men nobody knew seated to his left. “That said, these three men make up the bulk of this division’s new Internal Affairs group.”



“Who are they?” I asked, eying them. They looked away from my gaze.



“That’s on a need to know basis as well. What I can say is that they receive information from a high security detail that tracks the comings and goings of these ships. I.A. has done some preliminary work, but we need your expertise to confirm the initial findings. We have assigned you a family and location to work. Once you confirm these unauthorized aliens are real, we’ll need to start with the raids and detentions.”



“Where do you detain aliens? I can’t imagine we can put ALF in federal prison gen pop.”



“Not enough cats to feed him,” someone else said. We all laughed. Joe cleared his throat, and the mirth ended.



Joe continued. “We’ve constructed a secret facility around Brownsville. The city has a thriving import/export business. Nobody will be the wiser. From the outside, it looks like a warehouse for international trade,” Joe said, before smiling and adding. “I guess, in a way, it is a warehouse for trade. Intergalactic trade of unauthorized beings, not coffee from Guatemala.”



Most of the room laughed. I didn’t. Joe went through a few more details before breaking up the meeting and sending us on our way. Joe informed us we needed to gather as much detailed information as we could about the current targets. The raid and detentions would follow. After that, we’d move on to the next family. 



My assignment was to investigate the “Gonzalez family” in Brownsville. Joe told me this was the keystone case of Operation Merlin. My previous work with tough cases earned me the assignment. I felt an odd sense of pride - my past work was pretty stellar - but to use it to hunt aliens? That set my teeth on edge. But, as I’d done with my previous boss, I thanked him for the compliment and got ready to fly to Texas.



Once I got to Brownsville, I made a schedule for my work. I found chunking my tasks helped me focus. I’d split my time by digging into any paperwork I could find about the family - school reports, ID information, driver’s licenses, legal documents, court filings, etc… - and trailing them as they moved from place to place. Lather, rinse, repeat until the picture started to come into focus.



You build a case like you build a house: one brick at a time.



We were looking for any documentation that could determine their planet of origin and what, if any, plans they had for humans on Earth. In my daily spying, I was to record every person they interacted with and send that information back to DC. The I.A. team would look into those folks and give me instructions to either follow up or leave them be. 



Something that was different about this job was that each agent had been assigned to a different family. There was no overlap. No teams. That was unusual, as two heads are often better than one. Not to mention that teams talking to other teams always helped connect the dots in investigations. There’d be no fraternization between agents this time. In fact, management forbade it. 



Joe said he wanted to keep our focus on the task at hand. To me, it felt like a way to keep us in line. A lot of changes spooked the herd. Right now, we were damn near a stampede. When agents get together, we talk. Talking can spur ideas. Ideas can spur actions. Actions can change departments. Joe didn’t want that, so it didn’t happen.



I’d been in Brownsville for two weeks when I started having doubts about the case. I didn’t think the Gonzalez family were unauthorized aliens. All of my snooping had been a colossal waste of time. Nobody here colored outside the lines. 



Raul, the dad, worked for a local vending machine company and spent most of his days repairing and delivering machines to small businesses. Maria, the mom, worked at the front desk of a local hotel. She was an assistant manager and, by all accounts, was well liked by her co-workers. Nothing untoward between them.



That went the same for their kids. Eddie and Dawn were typical students at George Washington Elementary. Eddie was popular and funny. He was a natural athlete and played soccer and baseball for a local city-run league. He got along with pretty much everyone. Even the staff joked around with him.



Dawn was smart and in several school clubs, including the National Honor Society. She liked to read and spent a lot of time at the local library. I looked into what books she checked out just to see if there were any clues there. It was mostly graphic novels about plucky tweens. I was able to get my hands on some report cards and both their marks were high and the comments by the staff were all positive.



On Fridays, the Gonzalez family would do a pizza and game night at home. I’d watch through binoculars as they played Monopoly or Life or Boggle. They got along and seemed to enjoy each other’s company. There was a lot of laughter. Lot of love. If they were space aliens just thrown together for a mission, they went above and beyond what was necessary to convince me. 



They looked like a typical American family.



The worst thing I saw during those first few weeks was that Raul and Maria would smoke a joint at night after the kids went to bed. Even then, they did nothing wild and crazy. They’d have snacks, watch Netflix, and go to sleep. I felt like I was not only wasting my time, but wasting the department’s resources. If I wanted to watch The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, I’d find old episodes on YouTube. I didn’t need to do it in person.



 I relayed this information to Joe, but he told me the I.A. guys were dead certain that they were unauthorized aliens. I pushed back and reiterated that there was nothing shady happening here. I told him all of my opinions about the investigation. He didn’t like my answers. He asked about the marijuana use and if I knew who the dealer was. I told him they bought it from a local dispensary. It was all above board. Everything was.



“I swear, they are not aliens.”



“We know they are,” Joe said over the phone.



“There is no proof of that,” I said. “Is this personal? Do you want to get revenge on them or something?”



“I’m doing my job. The bosses say they’re monsters. We search until we prove they are.”



“We search to find the truth.”



“Truth is subjective,” Joe said. “I don’t have time to argue with a field hand. Find me something I can use or you can join the others at the unemployment office, understand?”



I asked if any other agents had found anything out of the ordinary with their targets. Not surprisingly, he refused to answer. Despite asking one last time, he also refused to let me leave. He said to stay on them because eventually they’d expose themselves for what they really were. I thought it was dumb, but didn’t bother to continue arguing. He knew my feelings and, besides, what was the point? Shit rolls downhill and I was the smelly target at the very bottom.



I kept up my surveillance, but I put little effort into it. It was a fool’s gambit. A waste of time. Instead, I doubled down on document duty. Maybe I could scare up something out of the ordinary in the paperwork or find something I missed at first glance. What I really hoped and prayed for was anything that would convince Joe that these were just people and not monsters. 



The first place I checked was Raul and Maria’s work records. I did my due diligence on the ground in Brownsville. Raul had been at the company for about ten years and all of his tax work seemed in order. Same with Maria. Though they’d lived at the same address for years, they were renters. Good ones at that. All rents paid on time. Their bank accounts were clean, too. 



What I couldn’t find organically, I called in favors with friends in the IRS or other agencies to track down information. I’d have to wait a day or two, but everyone got back to me. Same with any contacts with the local police. But, again, everything came back clean.



I went as far as tracking down birth certificates for everyone. Not surprisingly, they were all on the up and up. Except for Raul, though it wasn’t Earth shattering. There was a slight discrepancy with his birthday. The birth certificate listed June 3rd as his birthday. On his license, it was June 4th. 



This is not as uncommon as you think. Sometimes government bureaucrats punch in the wrong numbers. I didn’t even chalk it up as anything worth looking into. Just assumed it was a clerical error. I hesitated even including it in my paperwork, but felt compelled by the job. God knows Joe would rain down more shit if I didn’t include it and he found out.



That’s what struck me as odd about Joe. He wasn’t a good person. He went through the motions of being a good person, but it felt artificial. Like he was a robot with a “human algorithm” that he couldn’t change. Every interaction was the same: directive, compliment, order, subtle threat, compliment, directive. It was maddening to someone like me.



I’m a good person. You have to be to do this kind of work. As such, I knew I wasn’t doing anything useful. I was just snooping into these people’s lives for reasons that were kept secret from me. Based on his previous lust for revenge, I thought maybe Joe had some history with the Gonzalez family, but nothing connected the two. The Gonzalez family were just regular folks working toward the American dream. Joe was just a stooge following orders.



The next time I spoke with him, I, again, asked to get off the Gonzalez family case. I reaffirmed that there really was no case. The only things I’ve found that might be off were minor in the grand scheme of things. There were no signs of anything sinister. Smoking a joint and having a birthday off by one day on your license didn’t seem like national security concerns. I finished by telling him insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results and I was tiptoeing toward the nut-house.



Joe heard none of that. He laser focused on the date being wrong. He said this was the thing they’d been waiting for. I said it was a clerical error and nothing I had seen or found supported these people being unauthorized aliens. His birthday was the same on every other document I had found. The Gonzalez family were just American citizens living their day-to-day lives. He disagreed. He told me he needed to tell the higher ups about this and he’d contact me in a few days. 



That stretched to two long weeks.



Joe didn’t ask me to keep up my surveillance, but I did, anyway. I had several reasons for doing so. First, I was bored out of my skull. Brownsville isn’t exactly Las Vegas. The other was, even when I think a task is useless, I’ll still keep at it until the bosses say stop or the job is done. Perseverance is a strength of mine. Truthfully, it’s probably what kept me employed in the division. The cuts had been more severe than initially led on. I was lucky to still keep drawing a check, even if all I did was continue watching my new favorite show: The Wonderful Lives of the Gonzalez Family.



The next day, I tailed Raul as he left for work. At this point, I had memorized his routine. He’d stop at the main office, bullshit with the boys, eat a donut or three, get a work vehicle, check his stops, and head out for the day. Around noon, he liked to stop at a hole-in-the-wall Mexican place called Super Taco (which looked amazing) before finishing out his daily stops. Then, he dropped off the truck, drove to get the kids from various clubs/sports and head home for dinner.



Things were going as expected until he stopped at Super Taco. I’d watched this man work his way through the menu over the course of a few weeks. Each meal looked better than the last. I came to loathe this part of my day because all I wanted to do was indulge, but had to keep my distance.



That said, I had a good feeling where this case was going. My reports and conversations with Joe had been negative, to say the least. In my heart, I didn’t think Joe could make a compelling case to keep me here. I was starving and the thought of another fast food meal made my stomach turn. I decided to be bold and go inside. There are only so many times you can stare at a man housing a picture perfect barbacoa burrito before you break down and order your own.



I had broken down.



I entered about five minutes after Raul and took a seat nearby. He didn’t notice me, as he was too busy texting someone. I assumed it was Maria. Records indicated they usually did around this time. While pretending to look at the menu, I watched as a man came from the kitchen and took a seat opposite Raul. 



This wasn’t some cook or waiter. This man wore an expensive suit with a golden watch strapped to his wrist. They spoke in rapid fire Spanish. It had been a few dozen years since my high school Spanish class, so I couldn’t make out what they were saying. But the conversation seemed cordial. Friendly, even. 



The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Something was amiss. I’d been watching Raul for nearly a month and had never seen this man before. Hell, I’d never really seen Raul chat with anyone outside his home or the office. These two acted as if they were old friends. With him being obviously wealthy and us being so close to the border, I made assumptions. This was worth watching.



As I listened in and attempted to translate a word or two, my cellphone started buzzing. I ignored it and kept eating my free tortilla chips, but the person on the other end refused to hang up. I assumed it was probably a telemarketer or Joe. To be frank, I wasn’t itching to speak with either. Honestly, if I had my choice, I’d rather talk to the telemarketer. Maybe they’d had a job opening for me. After the twentieth ring, I answered. It was Joe.



“Where are you?”



“Working,” I said, taking a bite from the chip and monitoring Raul.



“The raid is happening in two days.”



“What? What raid?”



“Gonzalez family. Everything checked out. They’re aliens. I have photos to show you when I get down there.”



“When you get down here?”



“I’m on the next flight. Wanna hear the good news?” Joe asked, his voice so joyful I could see the smile from Texas. “You’re first man in.”



“What?” was all I could get out. A piece of the chip lodged in my esophagus. I tried clearing my throat to get it moving, but it didn’t budge. 



I took a drink of water but still felt the sharp edges stabbing the soft tissue. I tried coughing to loosen the grip, but that failed, too. The chip was trapped. I was choking. 



Joe was blathering, but I dropped my phone and stood up. Panic was setting in. Raul saw what was happening and sprung into action. He ran over and started the Heimlich maneuver. After the third thrust of his fist into my gut, I felt the chip break free and fly out of my mouth. I took in a big breath of life saving oxygen. Relief and air rushed into my body. It felt incredible.



Raul patted my back. “You okay, bro?”



“Yes,” said, my voice raw. “Thank you.”



“Man, when my wife told me to take that Every Day Life Saving class, I thought I’d never use it. She’s gonna be thrilled when she finds out it was money well spent.”



“I know the food is good, but you have to eat it slow,” the other man said to me.



“Your…place?” I asked, catching my breath.



“One of three,” he said proudly. “This was the first one and my favorite. My money managers say I spend too much time here, but I can’t help it. It’s special to me. It made me who I am.”



“I’ve heard good things.”



“Hearing about food is no bueno. You have to taste it to appreciate it. In fact, for your troubles, it’s on the house.”



“Oh, no. Not necessary,” I said. “It was my mistake. Don’t reward my stupidity.”



The man chuckled. “If eating delicious food makes you stupid, then everyone here should be sent to the funny farm, eh? Plus, if you like the chips that much, wait until you have the real food.” He kissed the tips of his fingers for emphasis.



“I’d take him up on it,” Raul said. “He never gives out free meals. I’ve been coming almost every day for years and the most he’s ever given me is a free horchata.”



“It was a discounted horchata, Raul.”



We all laughed. My phone kept buzzing. Joe was calling again. I thanked them, stepped outside, and took the call. Joe mostly rehashed what he had said, adding that he’d find me when he landed to finalize the plans. 



As he told me, I looked back at Raul. He was laughing with the owner. I didn’t believe he was an unauthorized alien from some other planet. I didn’t imagine he’d come here to overthrow Earth or enslave humanity or whatever other paranoid thing Joe believed. Raul was one of us. A good guy. Had to be. 



After my meal, I went back to my car and sat. Maybe if I didn’t move, I could disappear and not have to deal with this. There was a pulling sensation in my gut that lingered as I watched the sun arc across the sky. 



In operations, you develop a sixth sense about your case. When you spend so much time as an outside observer of someone’s life, you learn truths about them they don’t even know. You see reactions of others they interact with after their personal interaction ended. It’s telling.



Every person who dealt with a member of the Gonzalez family never looked upset about it. Myself included. The guy had saved my life. Had it not been for this job, I could see our families being friends. Tipping back beers around the grill while our kids played in the yard and wives gossip about who knows what.



But that wouldn’t come to pass. Joe had proof Raul and his brood were not like us. Foreigners to our world. Strangers to the human race. I didn’t see it. Or, I didn’t want to see it. That happened on operations too. You saw through the crime to the target’s humanity. Maybe that’s what was happening here. I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that my gut was churning and Joe wouldn’t be bringing an antacid.",1,1756566356.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

1n43uee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1n43uee/perpetual_motion_question/,Perpetual motion question,"I’m curious about perpetual motion and if there’s no loss in energy, is it technically possible within the laws of physics. 

My coffee shop thought was if you placed something into a location which had no gravity, was a complete vacuum, no stray particles, no light and you spun the object would it ever stop spinning? My non-educated thought was there should be nothing causing a loss of kinetic energy so it should rotate forever(ignoring eventual proton decay) right? 

Would this not be perpetual motion because the energy was used to create the motion originally? Is there another reason this isn’t considered perpetual motion? Is the impossibility of perpetual motion only an impossibility in the sense of extracting energy from an object or system in perpetual motion?

1n43udv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1n43udv/a_village_kid_with_no_background_built_a_new/,A village kid with no background built a new prompt framework — Resepi-95 (Recipe-95). Want to test it?,"By chatting with ChatGPT every day, I accidentally built a structured workflow I now call Resepi-95 (Recipe-95).
It’s like a recipe: ingredients, steps, and always a final “Meta-Prompt” you can reuse.

I’ve added a challenge prompt at the end — try it and tell me if it works or breaks.

TL;DR

Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = grassroots prompt-engineering framework born from trial & error, not academia.

Core workflow: Clarify → Execute → Self-Critique → Meta (always ends with a reusable template).

Variants: RIFO-95 (iterative), SPROUT-95 (idea branching), DECIDE-95 (decision matrix), VIZ-95 (visualisation), TEACH/LEARN-95 (education).

Tested on: essays, reports, SQL, ads, lesson plans.
Difference vs ToT/ReAct:
ToT = branching reasoning; ReAct = reasoning + actions.
Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = layered reasoning with a fixed Meta-Prompt output for reuse.

Mission: “Democratizing the Language of Technology.” Looking for feedback & real-world use cases.

 Resepi means recipe in Malay: ingredients + steps → repeatable workflows.

Core 4-Step Workflow

Clarify (95%) — ask critical questions until the task is almost fully understood.

Execute (Draft) — generate a first-pass answer.

Self-Critique — review against 5 guardrails: Relevance, Clarity, Structure, Tone, Accuracy.

Meta-Prompt — distill into a reusable template:
Task | Audience | Draft | Refinement | Final | Stopping Rule

Philosophy

Unlike one-shot prompting, Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) trains both AI and humans to think in layers.

For AI → enforce Clarify → Execute → Critique → Meta.

For humans → slow down, ask better questions, refine thoughts.

Net effect: it sharpens critical thinking, not laziness.



Example 1 — SPROUT-95 (Linear)

Task: TikTok content ideas for a coffee shop.

Flow: 5 concepts → 3 variants each → score (Cost/Engagement/Fit) → pick winner → upgrade to 30s script.


Meta-Prompt:
Task: Generate TikTok ideas for a coffee shop.
Audience: Small business owners.
Draft: 5 ideas → 3 variants each.
Refinement: Score & pick best.
Final: Winner = Funny Skits → 30s script.
Stopping Rule: Stop after winner + script delivered.
Value: Structured branching + decision = faster, higher-quality creative.

Example 2 — 4-Core with layered techniques
Task: Analyze renewable-energy adoption for a town.


Clarify (ToT for assumptions) → Execute (ReAct if tools/data allowed) → Self-Critique (Reflexion loop) → Meta (MAP to decompose final report).

Diagram: (insert Imgur link to 4-Core + ToT/ReAct/Reflexion/MAP)
Example 3 — Real quick office use case (Email)
User: HR staff → formal attendance-policy update.


Meta-Prompt:

Task: Write HR policy update email.
Audience: All employees.
Draft: Short formal email on attendance policy.
Refinement: Adjust tone to polite + professional.
Final: ""Dear Team, Starting next week, please ensure check-ins by 9AM...""
Stopping Rule: ≤150 words, clear CTA.

Value: Consistent tone, faster turnaround, reusable structure.

Strengths
Grassroots → easy to teach non-tech teams.
Layered → trains thinking.
Reusable → always ends in Meta-Prompt.
Composable → absorbs ToT, ReAct, Reflexion, MAP.
Limitations
Slower than one-shot.
Layers can feel heavy to beginners.
Not peer-reviewed (yet).
Needs community validation on advanced ML tasks.
Why I’m sharing
My mission: “Democratizing the Language of Technology.”


Please help by posting real metrics: time saved, error rate before/after Self-Critique, whether the Meta-Prompt sped up a second similar task.

Full Example — LEARN-95 (Recipe-95) in Action

Task: Design a 6-week “AI Literacy for Professionals” syllabus using LEARN-95.
Audience: Mid-career professionals (business, policy, education) with no CS background.
Goal: Learners finish with:
Core conceptual literacy (what AI/ML is, strengths/limits).
Practical literacy (run structured prompts, critique outputs).
Ethical literacy (bias, governance, social impact).
Reusable Meta-Prompts for their workplace tasks.

Step 1 — Clarify (Locate Goals & Constraints)

Duration: 6 weeks, 3 hrs/week.
Delivery: blended (in-person + AI co-tutor).
Constraints: low compute (Google Colab only), mixed English proficiency.
Learning outcomes (measurable):
LO1: Explain 5 core AI/ML concepts in plain language.
LO2: Execute at least 3 structured workflows (FLOW-95, RIFO-95, VIZ-95).
LO3: Critique an AI output against rubric (clarity, accuracy, bias).
LO4: Produce 1 reusable Meta-Prompt applicable to their own sector.

Step 2 — Execute (Draft Learning Plan)

Week-by-Week Draft:

W1: Fundamentals → What AI is/isn’t; LLM demo. Diagnostic quiz (10 items).
W2: Data basics → Features, labels, overfitting. Lab: Pandas + simple sklearn pipeline.
W3: Prompting frameworks → FLOW-95, RIFO-95. Practice: refine a bad draft.
W4: Ethics → Case studies (bias in hiring, surveillance). Mini-essay w/ rubric.
W5: Integration → Compare ToT, ReAct, Reflexion vs Recipe-95. Peer-review prompts.
W6: Capstone → Build + present a Meta-Prompt that automates one of their work tasks.

Step 3 — Self-Critique (Review & Refine)

Issue: syllabus may overload non-CS learners.
Fixes: Break labs into 2×45min blocks.
Add formative micro-tasks (2 quiz Qs + reflection each week).
Introduce rubrics early (clarity, accuracy, bias awareness).
Move ethics earlier (Week 3.5) so learners apply it in capstone.

Step 4 — Meta (Reusable Template)

Task: Design a [X-week] syllabus on [Topic] for [Audience].
Audience: [Learners’ profile + constraints].
Draft: Weekly breakdown with objectives, activities, assessments.
Refinement: Add scaffolding, rubrics, pacing fixes.
Final: Balanced curriculum with capstone + diagnostic/post tests.
Stopping Rule: Each week has ≥1 measurable LO + activity + assessment.


Challenge Prompt for Redditors

Paste this into your LLM and design your own syllabus in 5 minutes:

Design a 4-week micro-syllabus on “Responsible AI for Journalists” using LEARN-95.

Deliverables:
1) 3 measurable learning outcomes.

3) One rubric (3 criteria × 4 levels).
4) Diagnostic quiz (5 items).
5) Final Meta-Prompt template.

- Inherit a grocery franchise from a cranky aunt and manage daily duties such as stocking shelves, handling the cash register, and keeping staples like coffee and shampoo available.
- Strategic elements include negotiating with vendors, arranging waste disposal, and completing side quests—helping a fisherman or delivering quirky holiday items—to unlock new stock and upgrades.
- As profit accumulates, you can expand the store’s footprint, add new product categories, and renovate interiors, which raises inventory complexity and customer expectations.
- The narrative addresses real‑world themes, showing town resistance to larger chains and offering a humorous take on corporate expansion and environmental oversight.
- The game is released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

Why it matters: the title blends comforting aesthetics with substantive strategy, appealing to both casual and seasoned simulation players.

- Wednesday: Protein shake and coffee to start, a high fiber tortilla with eggs and chopped chicken for lunch, no interest at all for dinner but managed to eat about half what I would normally.  

- Thursday: Similar enough. But for dinner I was at a brewery for a networking event. Didn’t expect to eat much, but a beer later and I was straight up hungry. Ate the majority of a sizable “cuban” sandwich (even though it was terrible). I figured it was probably more due to anxiety from the event. 

- Friday: Barely ate through the day. Protein shakes and tried eating half a can of tuna prepped as a salad. Managed to eat/force half of that with half a tortilla. Wife and I go out for dinner and I wasn’t even interested in food, at all. Half a beer later, hungry, and while I didn’t go all out, I ate plenty. No shitty consequences later either.

My work tends to have me travelling across the country and sometimes abroad so, unfortunately the privilege of reading sometimes escapes me. However, now I am unshackled, at least temporarily.

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic but also just chill in general. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) and some Dark Romance reads as well. 

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature.

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop.

Here's what I'm doing this weekend (I believe I got this from Chris Bailey’s book, *Hyperfocus*, which I highly recommend). Give it a try:

Set 3-4 random alarms on your phone for the day. Make them truly random - maybe 10:47am, 1:23pm, 3:51pm, 6:18pm.

When each alarm goes off, stop and ask yourself one question: *""Did I choose what I'm focusing on right now, or did it choose me?""*

That's it. Just notice. No judgment.

What you might discover: Maybe you'll catch yourself 20 minutes deep in a Reddit rabbithole you never intended to go down. Or lost in thought as you're reading. Or perhaps you'll find you ARE doing exactly what you intended - savoring your coffee, having that conversation, or scrolling Reddit (it’s ok if it’s intentional!)

Most of us spend most of our days on ""attentional autopilot,” pulled from one thing to the next without conscious choice. This simple audit builds awareness of when you're steering vs. when you're being steered. It's a first step to developing meta-awareness (a real key unlock for diamond-level focus).

After each alarm, just notice your answer and return to what you were doing (or choose something different). By Sunday evening, you'll have a pretty clear picture of who's actually running your attention.

*By Your Favorite Sports Comedian-Handicapper*

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient goalposts, prepare for a tango of tension as Sarmiento de Junín (the ""Verde"") hosts Rosario Central (the ""Canalla"") in a match that smells like a mix of hope, desperation, and slightly burnt coffee. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up roasting a referee’s mom.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’re as clear as a VAR official during a penalty: **Rosario Central is the favorite**. Converting the decimal odds to implied probabilities (because math is the sport of champions):

* **Rosario Central**: \~48.8% chance (at -0.25 spread, per BetMGM).
* **Sarmiento**: \~25.6% chance (at +0.25 spread).
* **Draw**: \~33.9% (because this league loves stalemates like a toddler loves half-eaten cake).

The total goals line sits at **1.5**, with Over/Under odds favoring the Under (2.25 vs. 1.67). Translation: Buckle up for a snoozefest. Expect a game where scoring feels harder than convincing a teenager to do laundry.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Historical Baggage

**Sarmiento’s Problems**:

* They’ve lost **two straight away games**, which in football terms is like a toddler losing their first two battles with a juice box.
* Their home form? A disaster. They’ve only won **once** this Clausura, and their ""home"" fans are probably just ghosts at this point.
* The reserve team just got **shut out 1-0 by Central’s B squad**, which is as alarming as a baker running out of flour.

**Rosario Central’s Upswing**:

* They just **beaten Newell’s** in a classic, thanks to a goal from the ever-reliable Ángel Di María (or is that the younger one? Never trust a Di María with a nickname like ""Ángel""—it’s a setup for heartbreak).

Want to test it?,"Hye. I’m just a kampung (village) kid from Malaysia with no academic background in AI or prompt engineering.
By chatting with ChatGPT every day, I accidentally built a structured workflow I now call Resepi-95 (Recipe-95).
It’s like a recipe: ingredients, steps, and always a final “Meta-Prompt” you can reuse.

I’ve added a challenge prompt at the end — try it and tell me if it works or breaks.

TL;DR

Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = grassroots prompt-engineering framework born from trial & error, not academia.

Core workflow: Clarify → Execute → Self-Critique → Meta (always ends with a reusable template).

Variants: RIFO-95 (iterative), SPROUT-95 (idea branching), DECIDE-95 (decision matrix), VIZ-95 (visualisation), TEACH/LEARN-95 (education).

Tested on: essays, reports, SQL, ads, lesson plans.

Difference vs ToT/ReAct:
ToT = branching reasoning; ReAct = reasoning + actions.

Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) = layered reasoning with a fixed Meta-Prompt output for reuse.

Mission: “Democratizing the Language of Technology.” Looking for feedback & real-world use cases.

The Story

I built Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) with zero academic/corporate background — I’m a kampung (village) kid from Malaysia who learned prompting by daily chats with LLMs. Resepi means recipe in Malay: ingredients + steps → repeatable workflows.

Core 4-Step Workflow

Clarify (95%) — ask critical questions until the task is almost fully understood.
Execute (Draft) — generate a first-pass answer.
Self-Critique — review against 5 guardrails: Relevance, Clarity, Structure, Tone, Accuracy.
Meta-Prompt — distill into a reusable template:
Task | Audience | Draft | Refinement | Final | Stopping Rule

Philosophy
Unlike one-shot prompting, Resepi-95 (Recipe-95) trains both AI and humans to think in layers.


For AI → enforce Clarify → Execute → Critique → Meta.


For humans → slow down, ask better questions, refine thoughts.


Net effect: it sharpens critical thinking, not laziness.

Example 1 — SPROUT-95 (Linear)
Task: TikTok content ideas for a coffee shop.
 Flow: 5 concepts → 3 variants each → score (Cost/Engagement/Fit) → pick winner → upgrade to 30s script.


Meta-Prompt:
Task: Generate TikTok ideas for a coffee shop.
Audience: Small business owners.
Draft: 5 ideas → 3 variants each.
Refinement: Score & pick best.
Final: Winner = Funny Skits → 30s script.
Stopping Rule: Stop after winner + script delivered.

Value: Structured branching + decision = faster, higher-quality creative.
Example 2 — 4-Core with layered techniques
Task: Analyze renewable-energy adoption for a town.


Clarify (ToT for assumptions) → Execute (ReAct if tools/data allowed) → Self-Critique (Reflexion loop) → Meta (MAP to decompose final report).


Diagram: (insert Imgur link to 4-Core + ToT/ReAct/Reflexion/MAP)
Example 3 — Real quick office use case (Email)
User: HR staff → formal attendance-policy update.


Meta-Prompt:
Task: Write HR policy update email.
Audience: All employees.
Draft: Short formal email on attendance policy.
Refinement: Adjust tone to polite + professional.
Final: ""Dear Team, Starting next week, please ensure check-ins by 9AM...""
Stopping Rule: ≤150 words, clear CTA.

Value: Consistent tone, faster turnaround, reusable structure.

Strengths
Grassroots → easy to teach non-tech teams.
Layered → trains thinking.
Reusable → always ends in Meta-Prompt.
Composable → absorbs ToT, ReAct, Reflexion, MAP.
Limitations
Slower than one-shot.
Layers can feel heavy to beginners.
Not peer-reviewed (yet).
Needs community validation on advanced ML tasks.

Full Example — LEARN-95 (Recipe-95) in Action

Task: Design a 6-week “AI Literacy for Professionals” syllabus using LEARN-95.
Audience: Mid-career professionals (business, policy, education) with no CS background.
Goal: Learners finish with:
Core conceptual literacy (what AI/ML is, strengths/limits).
Practical literacy (run structured prompts, critique outputs).
Ethical literacy (bias, governance, social impact).
Reusable Meta-Prompts for their workplace tasks.

Step 1 — Clarify (Locate Goals & Constraints)

Duration: 6 weeks, 3 hrs/week.
Delivery: blended (in-person + AI co-tutor).
Constraints: low compute (Google Colab only), mixed English proficiency.
Learning outcomes (measurable):
LO1: Explain 5 core AI/ML concepts in plain language.
LO2: Execute at least 3 structured workflows (FLOW-95, RIFO-95, VIZ-95).
LO3: Critique an AI output against rubric (clarity, accuracy, bias).
LO4: Produce 1 reusable Meta-Prompt applicable to their own sector.

Step 2 — Execute (Draft Learning Plan)

Week-by-Week Draft:

W1: Fundamentals → What AI is/isn’t; LLM demo. Diagnostic quiz (10 items).
W2: Data basics → Features, labels, overfitting. Lab: Pandas + simple sklearn pipeline.
W3: Prompting frameworks → FLOW-95, RIFO-95. Practice: refine a bad draft.
W4: Ethics → Case studies (bias in hiring, surveillance). Mini-essay w/ rubric.
W5: Integration → Compare ToT, ReAct, Reflexion vs Recipe-95. Peer-review prompts.
W6: Capstone → Build + present a Meta-Prompt that automates one of their work tasks.

I was having a tough time getting any flavors out of some Dak espresso beans that I have. I reached out to Dak directly, and they recommended I do a 1:3 (18g in 54g out) ratio at around 35-40 seconds.

I had been making more “traditional” style espresso at 1:2 (18g in 36g out) at around 27 seconds, and the 3:1 ratio has really opened up some of the fruity light roast coffees I have.

1n43lwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1n43lwm/should_you_get_the_lifetime_folding_laptop_table/,Should You Get the Lifetime Folding Laptop Table for Daily Use?,"I've been using the Lifetime 28241 Adjustable Folding Laptop Table every day for the past several weeks, and it has quickly become one of my most versatile and practical pieces of furniture. At first glance, the design is straightforward, but using it in different settings made me appreciate its thoughtful features. Whether I’m working on my laptop, having a quick meal, or simply using it as extra surface space for a gathering, this folding table fits seamlessly into my daily routine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this folding laptop table strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality. Measuring 30 inches across and 19.37 inches deep, its size is compact yet spacious enough for most tasks. The entire table top is made from high-density polyethylene, supported by a weather-resistant powder-coated steel frame. This combination gives it both durability and long-lasting stability. It felt sturdy when I placed heavier objects, up to the recommended 75-pound limit, and I had no concerns about it wobbling. Bonus point: the white granite color gives it a clean and neutral look that blends well with any decor.

**Adjustable Height Settings**  
One of the standout features is its adjustable height, which ranges from 21 inches to 28 inches. This quickly became invaluable as I found myself using it in a variety of settings. In the mornings, I used it as a breakfast tray on the couch. Later in the afternoon, I adjusted it to a higher setup for some focused work on my laptop. It’s the type of feature you don’t know you need until you have it. While adjusting the height takes a little bit of effort with the side latches, it’s manageable and stays firmly locked when set.  

[Grab Lifetime 28241 Adjustable Folding Laptop Table at Amazon now.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b0006d50ro/)  

**Portability and Storage**  
Folding this table flat for storage is as simple as it gets. Once folded, its slim dimensions make it easy to tuck away behind doors or under a bed. Weighing just around 10.5 pounds, it’s light enough to carry from one room to another or even outdoors for a picnic or small gathering. I’ve personally dragged this into the backyard several times for impromptu coffee breaks, and it remains easy to transport without much hassle.

**Upsides**  
Here’s what stood out to me as some of the highlights of this folding table:  
- Versatile adjustable height allows for multiple uses like laptop work, meals, or hobby activities.  
- Durable high-density polyethylene and powder-coated steel make it stable and weather-resistant.  
- Lightweight and foldable design ensures portability and easy storage.  
- Clean, neutral aesthetic fits most environments seamlessly.  

**Pitfalls**  
As great as this table is, there are a few areas where it could improve:  
- The adjustable latch mechanism could use smoother functionality; it feels stiff at times.  
- Lack of customization options (like tilting or additional features) might make it less ideal for some use cases.  
- The tabletop surface, while durable, shows smudges easily and needs frequent wiping to maintain its pristine look.

**Market Rivals**  
In the world of adjustable folding tables, a few competitors come to mind. For instance, IKEA offers similar laptop tables that are slightly more affordable but lack the sturdy feel of this one. Another competitor would be the table from Cosco, which offers tilt functionality but doesn’t feel as stable at maximum height settings. The Lifetime table stands out due to its sturdy construction, weather-resistant finish, and thoughtful height adjustment options. However, for those who value compact options with tilting functionality, competitor models might offer more flexibility.  

**True Value**  
Considering the features offered, this folding table delivers excellent value for its price. Its sturdy build, versatility, and ease of storage justify the investment, especially for anyone needing a compact table for multipurpose use. I feel comfortable recommending it for both indoor and outdoor scenarios, particularly if you’re someone who likes to switch up your workspace or needs something flexible for small apartments. While it isn’t the most affordable laptop tray out there, the durability and thoughtful design make it worth every penny.

You might've seen old post about stories of this if you're a reoccuring student, but the story is basically students walking by gets lured to a white/black vans selling various of IT equipments claiming to be from Seneca (or posing as whichever post-secondary institution). They'll claim the product on the box (which just shows $12000 or some amount, no currency displayed) as will try to give you a ""discount"". Or they may also claim to sell discounted TVs and stuff.

Please do not approach them and immediate contact any security officer you see on-campus on where they are. Keep a good description of the location, plate number, vehicle, and how the scammer look so that the security officers has a good description. They are not legitimate sellers and will ask you to pay by cash cause you can't reverse it or trace it. If you don't have the cash on you (since who carries like $2000 in cash), they'll tell you to goto your bank's ATM.

Specifically for Seneca students, Seneca will never sell IT equipments without any notice and will send out emails regarding their IT hardware sales or this page ( [https://myshop.senecapolytechnic.ca](https://myshop.senecapolytechnic.ca) ).

[Example of the email by Seneca ITS.](https://preview.redd.it/46jf8ap146mf1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5fa4b21dd190e5107bb19b7b198236ddaf1cfc4)

You can also check the Calendar page on [https://students.senecapolytechnic.ca/spaces/112/mynews/calendar](https://students.senecapolytechnic.ca/spaces/112/mynews/calendar) and see what events are happening.

For other post-secondary institution, it's best to first ask your IT department or your Help Desk department first about any sales happening in the school and double check if you really do need the equipment and check online of the price/brand/reviews before purchasing.

I've had a student this Summer semester that came up to me saying that Seneca was selling Projectors for $4000. I was questioning why did they even need a projector for, and not a single projector I've ever heard of cost that amount from an unknown brand which the box labelled $12,000.

If you do get scammed, you can head down to the Security Office in Seneca for them to investigate and help give you assistance on what to do next. If security is not an option closest to you, contact the police non-emergency phone number. It's best to also contact your bank about the withdrawl you made and the situation.

You can see other students not only in Seneca but other post-secondary schools that these individuals go to.

1n43l5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLRY/comments/1n43l5a/saturday_morning_coffee_break_thoughts/,Saturday morning coffee break thoughts.,"**From looking over Max's Chart this morning of Brands & Subsidiary's, I'm wondering if the Investments / Diversifications Beyond Cannabis made over the years will bring in additional Tilray Brands or Subsidiary's?**

**International Expansion:** **Tilray's recent moves emphasize Europe and Medical Cannabis**. August 2025, TLRY expanded its medical cannabis portfolio in Germany (Europe's largest market) and also partnered with Italian pharmaceutical firm Molteni operating in 40 countries. TLRY also deepened ties in Italy (via FL Group) and continues to leverage regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical-grade products.

**FL Group has recently surfaced as a major subsidiary:**

* **FL Group S.R.L. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray Brands (through its Tilray Medical division) in 2022.** This followed Tilray's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Italian pharmaceutical distribution company, which had been **one of the first authorized by Italy's Ministry of Health in 2015 to import and distribute medical cannabis.** The integration allowed Tilray to expand its European operations, leveraging FL Group's established national distribution network for pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products. **By September 2022, FL Group was actively distributing Tilray's THC25 oral solution**.
* Diversification Beyond Cannabis: Tilray has invested heavily in beverages. Acquiring craft beer brands like SweetWater, 10 Barrel, Breckenridge, Atwater, etc and wellness, aiming for $billions in USA revenue. Irwin Simon CC closing remarks Tuesday's April 8: ""Thank you all for joining us today. As we look ahead, we see tremendous opportunities to grow our beverage business, and that includes adding more breweries to our portfolio. With prices where they are now, it’s a great time to invest in these assets and build out our capabilities."" 
* **Breckenridge Distillery has been the only USA Tilray Brand Beverage to make substantial beverages news this year with added popular Tequila's and and a line of Non Alc Spirits. I hope this leads to additions in the Alternative Beverages Division with 'THC / D9 Infused Spirits'. ""1st in the World, in the USA"" quoting Ty Gilmour.**

With U.S. cannabis still federally illegal, Tilray avoids direct MSO acquisitions to minimize regulatory risks. Instead, it pursues indirect plays, like hemp-derived products or waiting for rescheduling.  **'THC / D9 Infused Spirits'** fits that perfectly.



**Past U.S.-linked deals, like the MedMen notes, have been criticized as value-destructive, making Tilray cautious about similar entanglements.**

* **The chances of MedMen becoming a brand or subsidiary of Tilray Brands in the next few years appear extremely low, bordering on negligible.**

MedMen isn't a viable target for acquisition, it's already been liquidated. CEO Irwin Simon's vision focuses on ""global leadership"" in regulated markets, not U.S. retail consolidation amid ongoing federal uncertainty. (I put AYR in that same category).

Tilray may have cherry-picked some undervalued assets through Superhero (e.g., grow ops, equipment and 9-11 retail stores) but this doesn't equate to absorbing the MedMen brand or turning it into a subsidiary.

Searches across news, financial reports yield zero credible speculation about reviving MedMen under Tilray. Discussions from 2024–2025 frame the MedMen saga as a closed chapter, with Tilray's earnings calls and press releases silent on any brand revival or subsidiary plans. Irwin Simon on a July 31, 2024 TDR podcast did mention Medmen 3.0, but I believe that will only be with a 3rd party. Arms Length.

If full U.S. reform happens (e.g., via the SAFE Banking Act or descheduling by 2026 mid terms), Tilray could accelerate U.S. entry, but it would likely target stronger players (e.g., via partnerships with Green Thumb or Trulieve) rather than resurrecting bankrupt entities like Medmen or AYR, etc. Why get in bed with a Dead Horse?

Based on the liquidation, write-offs, and Tilray's pivot to Europe/diversification, I'd peg the odds at under 5%.

The cannabis sector's M&A is heating up, but MedMen is off the table in my opinion.

If U.S. policy shifts dramatically or new filings emerge, this could change, but as of now, there's no indication of movement.

Others investments made: 

* **Schroll Medical out of Denmark** \- ""In its efforts to expand globally, Canadian licensed producer (LP) Aphria (TSX:APH) announced on Tuesday (September 4, 2018) that it has formed a partnership with Schroll Medical out of Denmark"". Aphria did write in an option of increasing ownership. EU may bring this forward?
* A number of years ago Aphria made numerous, large investments into HighTide. But being retail I think Simon stays away from this but only adds products to its shelves.. ""Aphria Anchors High Tide $10 Million Capital Raise April 10, 2019""...
* I read an article from Javier who was last fall with Benzinga state that CGC would likely be selling off the NON USA Medical Cannabis Businesses, likely to Tilray Brands. Javier went to another job and news stopped. CGC however is raising money now. Could anything happen there?

  
UK & Middle East, Turkey have been mentioned by Tilray as expansion target areas.

After my trip to Medellin, I started buying Pergamino coffee. I wonder why it's not discussed more on Reddit. It's well sourced, might not have the best profiles, but it's very pure. I just need to crack the code on how to extract the most flavor. For example, this one was roasted on 8/12 and I just opened a bag today to try. Very light, super low acidity, no bitterness—a hint of fruit or berry. I think I either need to let it rest a little more or use a Mugen to extract more flavor. Might also be good to use a slower filter (I used Abaca for this one).

I would love to know if anyone else has experience with this brand? I know when I was in Colombia, out of all places, this one had THE Best flat white. I was craving it every day. Still do :)

October 10, Monday

I find this whole thing ridiculous. Medication should’ve been enough. But my doctor said writing would help me. As if keeping a stupid journal would bring my wife back. She disappeared not long ago. One night I had to leave urgently for work, and when I came back, she was gone. She didn’t answer my calls. There were no signs of struggle in the house. Lisa had simply vanished. The police are still searching, but as time goes on, I lose more and more hope. As if her disappearance wasn’t hard enough, I started having hallucinations. Some nights I would wake up to the sound of her voice. Not nightmares—the voice continued even when I was awake. I thought it would pass in a few days. Just trauma, nothing more. But it didn’t go away. So as a last resort, I went to a specialist. And what did he do? Handed me a piece of paper and told me to write whenever I saw her, whenever the visions came, and take my pills. I don’t know. Maybe it’ll work. I’ll try.

October 11, Tuesday

Last night it happened again. I had locked my bedroom door before bed. Around 3 AM, I woke to the sound of a vase shattering. Then came Lisa’s weak, whimpering cries. Right outside the door. But when I opened it, there was nothing—no wife, no broken vase. Just silence. I keep telling myself these are hallucinations, tricks my mind is playing on me. But they feel so real. I could swear the sound came from just behind the door. If I believed Lisa was here, I would’ve gone to her and asked if she was okay. The doctor told me to stay put and calm myself down when it happens. I took my pill and went back to bed. Thankfully, it relaxed me.

October 12, Wednesday

No voices last night. I woke up almost happy this morning. But when I went to take a shower, I saw her. Lisa. She was writing something on the bathroom mirror—with her own blood. It was pouring out of her. Her hair a tangled nest, her skin nearly green. Her face… it was my wife’s face, and yet not hers at all. She turned her head when she noticed me. Then she ran straight toward me, arms outstretched as if to grab me. I slammed the door shut before she reached it. But I never heard her body hit the door. Not a sound. I couldn’t bring myself to open it again. So I went to work this morning without showering.

October 13, Thursday

Last night was different. I heard footsteps pacing in front of my bedroom door. Heavy, like someone wearing military boots. Then Lisa started screaming.

“Stay away! Stay away! No! Don’t!”

Her cries of pain wouldn’t stop. And then suddenly, silence. As if someone had ripped her vocal cords out. That’s when the knocking started. Slow, rhythmic knocks on my door. This was him—her killer. Even in my hallucinations, he finds me. He knocked politely a few more times, then stopped. I don’t know what to think anymore. Are the pills failing? Is this getting worse? I’ve done everything the doctor told me. The only thing I know is that I can’t take much more of this.

October 14, Friday

I was standing in line at the office coffee machine today. Just as I turned to leave with my cup, I felt someone tap my shoulder. When I looked back, it was Lisa. Her eye sockets sunken, her hand leaving a bloody print on my shirt. And she was smiling. I could smell the stench of rot on her breath. I panicked and spilled my coffee. My coworker Marcus screamed—it was him who got burned. I rushed to help him, pretending it was just an accident, but inside I knew what had happened. After that, I took the rest of the day off. I don’t want to leave work—at least there, I can distract myself and Lisa stays away. But staying home feels more dangerous. Still, maybe it’s safer for my colleagues if I stay away.

October 15, Saturday

The boots were back. Pacing the corridor outside my room. Lisa’s cries followed. She was begging. Pleading. Then came the pounding on my door, so loud the walls shook.

“Carl! Please!”

My wife’s voice called my name from just inches away. I got up, heading for my pills.

“Carl!”

She screamed my name again. I forgot the pills. She needed me. I had to save her from him. My feet carried me to the door. I gripped the handle, ready to open it—until I heard her scream again. A scream no longer human. And then… silence. Frozen silence. The knocking returned. The killer knocking, calmly, politely. He knows I’m here. This time I forced myself to take the pills and breathe. I don’t think I’ll sleep tonight.

October 16, Sunday

I decided to go for a walk today. The thought that a killer waits for me inside this house is becoming too real. Maybe he’s hiding somewhere, waiting for the right moment to strike. I searched everywhere—drawers, closets, under the bed. No one. The fresh air helped clear my head. Back home, I picked up a book. Lisa’s favorite. She read it a thousand times and always begged me to read it once. I never did. Until today. I opened to the last page she had read. That’s when I noticed the stains. A drop of blood on the corner. Then two on the next page. Then smears along the margins. And then I saw it—words scrawled in blood across the printed text:

“Reading is pointless.”

I turned the page and vomited onto the carpet. The rest of the book had been hollowed out, its pages carved into a cavity holding… an eye. Hazel, vibrant, alive. Hers. Lisa’s. This can’t be a hallucination. I could feel the dried, sticky blood. And I had just taken my pills. I shouldn’t be seeing this. None of this should be happening.

October 18

She’s at my door every night now. Crying. Pounding. Begging me.

“Carl, please. Let me go. Please. Why… why?”

I want to help her. But I can’t open the door. I tried talking to her. She never answers, just repeats the same words.

“Carl… why? Why? Don’t… No… Let me go.”

And then the killer comes. He pounds on the door, harder every night. I bury my head under the pillow, but the sound never stops. He wants me.

Date unknown

I finished the pills. The whole bottle. There’s none left. What will I do tonight?

Date unknown

She’s begging again. My wife. I have to help her. This time I can save her. If I open the door, I can face him. I can protect her.

Date unknown

It’s a trap. The killer is using her voice to lure me. If I open the door, he’ll take me too. Lisa’s screams are worse than ever. She says new things now.

“My eyes… you took my eyes. It hurts.”

If I open the door, he’ll take mine too. I’ve barricaded it. He won’t get in. But God… he’s strong. So strong.

Date unknown

He’s going to break through. He’ll smash the door to pieces. I need to call the police. Where’s my phone?

Date unknown

She’s gone. No voice tonight. But the boots… I hear them again.

Date: Help me

He’s breaking it. He’ll get in tonight. He’s more insistent than ever. The barricade won’t hold. This is the end. I’m going to die. I shouldn’t have… I’m sorry, Lisa. I shouldn’t have.

Date:

The killer. I saw him. I saw his face.

October 26, Wednesday

The weather is beautiful today. It rained all night. The river down the road must be flooded. I heard the rain stop around dawn. Perfect morning for a walk. I love the smell of wet soil, the crisp chill of autumn air. The forest a few kilometers away will be stunning—birds singing, leaves glowing orange and red. I’ll drive there. I just hope the road isn’t too flooded, or the ground too muddy. I should wear boots. My only pair are military boots, but they’ll do. The sun is warm, almost apologetic for the storm. Maybe I’ll see a rainbow along the way. I shouldn’t waste time.

Wait. Is that the neighbor’s dog? It’s in my yard again, sniffing, digging under the tree. Lately, it keeps coming back. Always scratching at the same spot.

I guess I’ll have to bury Lisa’s body deeper.

Each brand has its own app, with logins and slow loading screens. Many times I just give up, even when I could save money at checkout.

Recently I found an app that made things much simpler. All the cards show up instantly on the first screen (no loading, no pop-ups) and it even works offline.
It’s 100% free, collects no personal data, and requires no permissions — that really caught my attention.

I’m testing it with my supermarket loyalty card, a couple of cafés, and some digital eGift coupons. It feels much more practical than keeping five different apps.

🔎 If you’re curious: on Google Play, search “Points&Coupons” (with the & symbol). Without the “&” it’s harder to find.

How do you usually organize your loyalty and coupon cards? Do you stick with the store apps, or use some other solution?

Looking for someone to play dead by daylight with,"Hello! Thank you so much for checking out my post. I’m new to this subreddit but I’ve noticed there are quite a few posts from men that get little to no attention. I just wanted to start by saying thank you! No pressure to read this post entirely, I’m just gonna ramble about myself for a bit. Namely my interests and what I’m looking for. 

I’m always looking for friends to play dead by daylight with so if that’s your game then feel free to free to reach out. There’s no obligation for anything romantic to develop. Really I’m just making this post to make some friends and POSSIBLY something more but my preference would be to be friends first and then something else later if we click. (If you’re queer and neurodiverse then we will probably get along lol) I’m a very no nonsense type of person, I think honesty is the best policy but I think that it’s possible to be honest and kind. 

I just want to clear something up, some people’s interpretation of bisexuality is that we exclusively date men OR women and that Nonbinary folks are off the table. That’s not at all how I feel, I’m attracted to all kinds of gender expression and I think I’ve stuck with the bisexual label because it’s the label I feel comfortable identifying with. If you are all hesitate about reaching out because you’re worried that I’m not going to accept you for who you are then please know that you are valid and appreciated. Life is too short to not be your authentic self and I want to get to know the real you. 

My interests : 

The big one is Psychology, I’m currently a student and every day I try to learn something new about it. I will yap for hours about it so please stop me lol. Besides that I also enjoy philosophy and in particular Zen and existentialism. I love all sciences so big plus if you’re also STEM oriented. I’m not exclusively interested in nerdy stuff. I love being in nature and going on walks. I also write poetry whenever I’m on the bus and sometimes mess around with modular synthesis (programming analogue computers to make “music” usually bleep bloop noisy garbage)  

Besides that I’m a huge fan of shows like:

Adventure time, Dandadan, Jojo’s bizzare adventure, delicious in dungeon, avatar the last airbender, anime is a big interest but I often return to these shows. I really only watch anime that’s on Netflix but will definitely expand my horizons and watch shows you like if you’re also a big anime fan.

Games I play:

Dead by daylight, Borderlands 2 and 3, Baldur’s gate 3, darkest dungeon, dead cells, Elden ring, I also run a ttrpg game (Vampire the Masquerade) chess (I’m really a novice level and don’t think I’ll ever get out of <1k elo hell) backgammon. I’m open to playing coop games if there’s one you really like. 

Music I love:

Gorrilaz, Steely Dan, King Crimson, Talking Heads, Beatles, MF DOOM, Jimi Hendrix, Fleetwood Mac, Led zeppelin, Queen, Bob Dylan, Prince, ABBA, Nirvana. I’m always looking to expand my music horizons so please recommend me stuff. 

Who I’m looking for :

Definitely someone who is independent, kind and willing to share special interests. I’m autistic, I got my diagnosis two years ago and I have found that I get on great with other autistic people. I LOVE feminine men and masculine women but I like people for who they are and appearances can be deceiving. I think that if it gets to the stage of wanting to meet up for coffee I’d be happy to send a picture of myself if it would make you more comfortable. if you’re looking for an online romantic relationship I’m happy being friends but would prefer to be with someone that I can hang out with irl. I am monogamous. 

My physical description :

5’10” heavy set guy, beard that’s brown but gets reddish when it’s longer (I tend to keep it trimmed) short brown hair. I live in cardigans, jeans and loose shirts. Boots are always my go to footwear. Unfortunately I am balding at 23, I’m probably gonna shave it off at some point but I’ve come to terms with it. Sometimes I paint my nails black. 


TLDR : Happy to chat with anyone but if you’re looking for something I’d prefer you live in Scotland. Neurospicy and chill vibes. Would love to get coffee if we get on. Regardless, best of luck finding who you’re looking for 😊

1n43a8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayedAndHeard/comments/1n43a8y/explore_if_the_best_acoustic_guitar_washburn/,Explore if the Best Acoustic Guitar Washburn HG12S Delivers Quality,"The Washburn HG12S Heritage 10 Series Grand Auditorium Acoustic Guitar quickly grabbed my attention with its clean, natural mahogany finish and sturdy feel. As both a casual strummer and an occasional fingerpicker, I was eager to see if it lived up to its reputation. Armed with a cup of black coffee and a list of songs to test, I spent the afternoon with the guitar nestled in my lap. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the solid mahogany top paired with mahogany back and sides. This construction isn't just for aesthetics — it contributes significantly to the warm, rich tones the guitar emanates. It's polished to a smooth satin finish, making it visually inviting but not overly flashy. I particularly loved the Heritage decal rosette around the soundhole, giving it a classy touch. The rosewood fingerboard and bridge provide a smooth playing experience, and the diecast tuners ensure precise tuning. Weighing only 4.4 pounds, the guitar feels lighter than you’d expect but doesn’t compromise durability. If you’ve wrestled with uncomfortable guitar shapes, the Grand Auditorium body with scalloped-X bracing hits the sweet spot between comfort and projection.

**Sound Performance**  
This instrument has depth, and I mean that quite literally in its sound. The warm tones of the solid mahogany top came alive with minimal effort, and the resonance lingered beautifully after each strum. Whether I was gently fingerpicking a ballad or energetically strumming an upbeat tune, the guitar held its own. The volume projection surprised me for its size, and the cathedral peaked scalloped-X bracing played a clear role in this. My nephew, a budding guitarist, borrowed it for a performance, and it filled the room with sounds more akin to a pricier model.

[Check Washburn HG12S price on Amazon.](https://voyss.com/p/b01bo6pprg/)

**Playability and Comfort**  
With a scale length of 25.5 inches and a Nubone nut width of 1-11/16 inches, the guitar felt very natural to play. The satin mahogany neck ensures it slides smoothly under your hand, reducing any wrist fatigue during extended sessions. I handed it over to my coworker, who has larger hands than me, and even he found the neck profile comfortable. The lightweight design combined with the ergonomic grand auditorium body made it a joy to hold for hours without feeling like a chore. Even the fixed rosewood bridge felt stable, keeping the Cleartone phosphor bronze strings securely in place throughout heavy playing.

**Strengths**  
This guitar has a lot going for it, and I’ve narrowed the highlights here:  
- Solid mahogany top provides warm, full-bodied tones that age beautifully over time.  
- Cathedral peaked scalloped-X bracing significantly enhances volume and resonance.  
- Smooth satin finish and lightweight build improve player comfort.  
- Diecast chrome tuners allow for quick and accurate tuning adjustments.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite being a thoroughly enjoyable guitar, there are some quirks worth mentioning:  
- The tortoise pickguard is aesthetically questionable to some, though functional.  
- While suitable for small gigs or home studios, it may not project enough in large, crowded venues.  
- A gig bag or case isn’t included, which feels essential for its protection.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing the Washburn HG12S to peers, its closest rivals include models from Yamaha and Fender’s beginner-friendly guitars. For example, the Yamaha FG800 boasts a similar price point but features a spruce top, giving it a brighter tone compared to the warmer sound of Washburn’s mahogany. On the other hand, the Fender CD-60S, although comparable in price and build, doesn’t quite match the HG12S’s resonance and visual appeal. However, both competitors often come with accessories or cases, which give them a slight edge in value.

**Financial Value**  
If we’re talking about smart spending on acoustic guitars, this one delivers a solid value proposition. It offers the playability and tonal quality of guitars that could cost significantly more. While the exclusion of a travel bag or accessories means a minor added expense, the craftsmanship and sound are well worth the investment. Dollar for dollar, its sound and build quality provide a balanced price to quality ratio, which makes it feel like a bargain.

**Question:** What is the best POS system for a small business?

**Target Reader:** Independent restaurant and retail owners

**SEO Keywords:** point of sale, POS system, small business POS

---

As a small restaurant or retail owner, you've probably wondered: *What is the best POS system for my small business?* Choosing the right point-of-sale system can feel overwhelming, given the myriad of options available. It's a critical decision because the right POS can streamline your operations, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately boost your bottom line.

## What Makes a POS System the ""Best"" for Small Businesses?

The ""best"" POS system for a small business isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It depends on your specific needs, operations, and goals. However, three general features make a POS system stand out: usability, integrations, and cost-effectiveness.

### Usability

A great POS system should be intuitive and easy to use. Remember, your staff may need to operate this system during busy hours. An overly complicated system can lead to errors and slower service, both of which can frustrate customers. Look for systems with user-friendly interfaces, straightforward navigation, and efficient customer support.

### Integrations

Your POS system should integrate seamlessly with other tools you use, such as inventory management software, payroll systems, and online ordering platforms. This cohesiveness saves time and reduces the risk of errors that occur when transferring data between different systems manually.

### Cost-Effectiveness

While enterprise-level POS systems offer many features, they can be overkill—and expensive—for small businesses. Look for POS solutions that provide the functionalities you need at a price point you can afford. Many providers offer subscription-based plans, which can be more manageable than hefty one-time fees.

## Practical Example: Joe's Coffee Shop

Let’s imagine Joe's Coffee Shop, a small café with a loyal customer base. Joe needs a POS system that handles daily transactions, integrates with his inventory and payroll software, and doesn't require extensive training for his baristas. 

Joe chooses a cloud-based POS system with a simple interface, which allows his staff to quickly ring up orders and process payments. The system syncs with his inventory management tool, automatically updating stocks as sales occur. Moreover, it offers payroll integration, simplifying the process of calculating wages and managing employee hours. Joe can also check daily sales reports from his smartphone, helping him make informed business decisions on the go.

## Quick Takeaways

- **Usability:** Choose a user-friendly system to ensure smooth daily operations.
- **Integrations:** Ensure the POS integrates with your existing business tools.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Opt for a cost-effective solution that meets your business needs.
- **Cloud-Based Features:** Consider a system that offers remote access and real-time data updates.
- **Support:** Ensure reliable customer support for troubleshooting and guidance.

Today, I’d like to share a story that was originally posted in the OST group, and this one was submitted by Naina. All credit for the story goes to them, and to the OST community for keeping these stories alive.


THE CHILDREN IN THE ATTIC PART 1

Dear OST readers,
This story takes place in the Netherlands.

My aunt Raisa has lived in the Netherlands for many years. She moved there as a young girl, and by the time I visited her as a teenager, she was already a mother of two children. Before I stayed with her, I had no idea that her family had been dealing with strange problems for years.

Raisa either saw it as something “normal,” or maybe she didn’t think too much about it—because she never spoke about it to anyone. At that time, her baby was only a few weeks old. In the Dutch way, the baby had her own bedroom. Raisa and her husband slept in their own room, while I was allowed to sleep in the room of my 4-year-old cousin.

I spent several months in the Netherlands and stayed mostly with Raisa because of the baby. I adored her and loved taking care of her whenever her parents were at work. I’m not the kind of person who scares easily, so it didn’t bother me to be alone in the house with the children. Raisa and her husband ran their own business, and they usually only came home around 6 or 7 p.m., leaving me alone with both kids during the day.

During the day, everything was fine. I stayed downstairs with the children, and they often took their naps there too. The baby was calm and slept well, so I had plenty of time to myself—usually spending it online on MSN. Back then, MSN Messenger was very popular, but my friends in Suriname were often not online yet due to the time difference. I also struggled with jetlag, so I often stayed up long after everyone else went to bed.

I didn’t like being alone downstairs at night, tossing and turning in bed wasn’t for me, so I asked my aunt if I could take the laptop up to the attic. She didn’t mind. So, every evening when everyone went to bed, I went upstairs to the attic. There was a desk and a comfortable chair where I could chat for hours. I often brought snacks and drinks with me.

From the beginning, I noticed that every single night, my baby cousin cried terribly. Whenever my aunt went to check, nothing was wrong—her diaper was clean, and she wasn’t hungry. My aunt would soothe her back to sleep, but this happened every single night. I found it strange.

Sometimes, my 4-year-old cousin would also scream in his sleep. He would sit upright in bed and cry out loudly. I had never seen anything like it, and I began to wonder what the cause could be. At first, I thought maybe the baby slept too much during the day, but even on days when she hardly napped, she would still wake up crying at night. Her crying sounded strange, as if she were in pain or struggling to breathe. My heart broke for her.

During the day, I often talked to her, even though she was too young to reply. I asked her what was wrong, why she cried so hard at night. I really felt for those children.

One evening, I was on the attic chatting away when I heard footsteps on the stairs. I stopped typing, expecting to see my aunt’s head appear any moment—but nothing. I thought I had imagined it and kept chatting. Suddenly, I heard the sound of little footsteps running behind me. I turned around, smiling, ready to ask my cousin what he was doing out of bed so late.

But no one was there.

The attic only had a freezer, a washing machine, and an ironing board against the wall. There was nowhere for a small child to hide. I looked around anyway, but saw nothing. I turned back to the laptop, now on edge.

For a while, everything was quiet. Just when I began to relax, I heard footsteps again—this time running toward the stairs. I didn’t look, but I listened closely. I clearly heard someone—or something—going down the stairs.

A minute later, my cousin screamed from his bedroom and began crying loudly.

I quickly shut down the laptop and rushed to his room. My aunt was already there, calming him. When he finally settled, she left, but I stayed and lay down beside him. I told him a story until he fell back asleep.

The next morning, when we were alone, I asked him why he had cried so hard. He told me that a little boy always came to bother him in his sleep, wanting to play. And when my cousin didn’t want to wake up, the boy got angry—sometimes hitting him, sometimes scaring him. That’s why he cried so much.

I asked him why he never told his mother, and he said he hadn’t.

I didn’t know how to bring this up to my aunt. I didn’t know how she—or her husband—would react. They always came home together, so I was rarely alone with her. Finally, one Saturday night, after the kids and her husband had gone to bed, Raisa stayed up with me to watch a movie.

I made us coffee, and we sat down to watch TV. Carefully, I brought up what had happened the night before, when her son Rich had cried so hard. I asked if this happened often, and she said yes. From birth, he had cried almost every night without any reason like hunger or a dirty diaper. She noticed the same pattern now with her daughter, Sade.

Since Sade’s birth, Rich no longer cried every night, but only sometimes. But now it was Sade who cried nightly. Rich used to sleep in that bedroom, but after Sade was born, he moved to the other room.

I asked Raisa if she didn’t think that was strange. She agreed it was. I asked her why she never did anything about it. Four years had passed like this—was she planning to just let it continue? She said that one cry per night wasn’t too bad, and besides, she didn’t know what to do. She didn’t know anyone who could help, and her husband Max didn’t believe in anything paranormal at all. So she just left it alone.

I asked her if she had ever experienced anything strange herself. She said no. And if Max had, he wouldn’t admit it, since he didn’t believe in such things.

I decided to keep quiet for now and try to see for myself what was really happening in that house.

The more I watch W&C actions the more similarities I find in my story. 3 years before I met my wife, I was friendly/dating a girl who had some serious issues and I thought by befriending her and helping her I could walk with her through her addictions and ailments come out on the other side. My “girlfriend had a serious addiction to opioids (in pill form). I worked Wednesdays, Fri, Sat and Sunday. At the time Fri - Sun she would have to check herself in to Green  Bay that is a jail facility in Fort Worth that is for medical and for court orders weekend incarcerated. Monday through Thursday she worked off her community service at a women’s shelter.  In May her Green Bay visits had ended and she met all the terms of her sentence for driving  under the influence of opioids. Her car had been impounded for weeks. She had 2 children ages 11 and 4 and if I was with her she was allowed overnight visits. This was disastrous because she was buying her opioids on the street (she was seemingly) high functioning. She didn’t smoke or like weed. She didn’t drink alcohol. She had developed bulimia and anorexia. Her years of opioids with the bulimia and anorexia had taken quite a toll on her heart. She was also suffering (or at least I was told) cervicel cancer which I now believe was endometriosis (regardless it needed medical attention). I started staying over nights and cooked for her, did her laundry, fed her and loved her with all my heart. Her husband came from old Fort Worth well, her father-in-law was a well respected and well off doctor and the in laws had tried everything from expensive and long term treatments. Her father was a POS of an attorney with his own addictions, her mother had agoraphobia, and her siblings had their burdens. However her husband and his parents did everything medically and emotionally they could, the marriage was suffering and so were the children. I became the parent when my gf had the children for the weekend because she physically couldn’t. I must preface this with the fact that my girlfriend was a tortured angel. (Truly family drama from a young age.. for example: when she was 8 her father had her kidnapped by “unscrupulous thugs” in order to extort money from his father in law. She was kidnapped for over a week. This was in the 1980’s. Also her father would sell both his daughters to men filming pornos, she was also living at ground zero when 9/11 happened. She was home alone with her firstborn and her husband was safe.) Needless to say she still carried a beautiful loving spirit. However her drug use and incidents left all member of her family immediate and in-laws letting go and getting her an apartment. They gave her a bed and chair. I brought her over my tv, coffee pot, food and cooking tools. I didn’t know when I would go to sleep or not be there her dealer was delivering. However, for 2 months I stayed there (still keeping my own apartment). I would get frustrated at times and have to go home to give her and myself some space. From the 21st - 30th of June I was in Puerto Rico working. I came home and I thought things were “ok”. Two days later.. I woke up before her to make coffee and look at my schedule. I went to wake her and she was unconscious and not breathing. I called 911 and started CPR, until EMS arrived, they brought back a faint heart beat but she only lived 5 more hours on a machine. The reason I write this is the games C&W play is worse than the scenario I have jived through. The cars, the apartment, the recording when SM doesn’t want this! C&W believe they own people if they do something for them. They don’t have right to go into that apartment unless their names are on the lease even if they did pay the rent. Their mockery, rudeness and invasion of privacy is sickening. Something needs to be done. ",16,1756564456.0,ExposingWendyWortham,11,0.95,False

I am honestly a bit confused and still processing.

How did I, a basically random broke person sitting on the couch in ratty sweats, make **$100 IN ONE WEEK** just by downloading and testing apps from my phone? 😳 Like, this can’t be real… can it??

I had ALWAYS thought these “get paid for apps” things were scams. Clickbait. Legendary nonsense.

But out of sheer curiosity (and, okay, a little bit of desperation), I stumbled on this site:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

That’s the magic link.

LET ME SPELL OUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

- I signed up, and it took like 2 actual minutes.
- The site gave me a list of new apps to try.
- I downloaded a couple. Played around. Some were games (the Mario Kart knockoff was addictive), some were survey fun.
- For each app, they paid out $2–$6 for a review. Legit. Not imaginary numbers!

Deciding to test the waters, I tried three apps first.

Feedback screens popped up and I answered some questions “Which feature did you click first?”, “How’s the UI?”, etc.

No lie -- after a few days I checked my account, and BOOM, money was in there.

**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
I honestly checked if it was some play money. Or just, like, screen confetti. But when I hit ""withdraw,” $28 ACTUALLY dropped into my Paypal.

WAIT… IS THIS REAL LIFE?!

I started going hard. Tried 4-5 more apps. Stayed up late one night rating some puzzle game (never finished the puzzles! 😂), and they paid me for half-baked feedback.

A single hour of actual “work” and I woke up to another $12.20 the next day. Am I in a simulation? This cannot be normal! Who knew sitting around and rating weird apps would legit pay for my pizza night??

Here’s what I learned, and why I’m still so shocked:

- DON’T underestimate your phone and your boredom. Apparently, that combo = money.  
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is NOT a scam (swear!!). Didn’t get strange requests. Didn’t see any “download a crypto wallet weirdness.”
- Variety of apps — games, shopping, journaling. Perfect distraction in line at Starbucks.

The best hack I figured out:

- Rate the most interesting apps first (the feedback takes longer but pays more)
- Don’t overthink the feedback. They mostly want honest first impressions.

Final Thoughts:

I STILL don’t get how this is legal/legal legal, ya know? 😂 When did we cross into a world where I can pay. For. My. Coffee?? Using Couch Potato Energy?? This is wild.

If you want to try it (for science/for lattes/for your rent!), don’t NOT try it!  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

If ANYONE else gives this a shot and somehow hits a random windfall, PLEASE let me know if my simulation theory is legit, because I’m genuinely, hilariously SHOCKED right now that this worked.",1,1756564139.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

If I order something very different at cafes, say co-ferments, I know it’s gonna be a very different experience from my daily routine, but I also find that I don’t really enjoy it that much, especially if there’s some fermented flavor.

If I get clean washed coffees, it’s not gonna be that different from what I already have at home. So I would feel I’m not really getting my money’s worth.

The screen lit up instantly, and I swear the colors looked extra vibrant, even under the rain clouds. Later, I went out for coffee and tried to use the new camera zoom feature. That café window had this old jazz poster stuck on it, and with a quick double-tap I zoomed in four times. The details in that poster tiny text, rust stains looked way sharper than I expected. I even stopped a stranger to say “hey, check this out,” because it made it look almost printed. Battery life also surprised me.

I have plans of seeing how long I can last in this challenge. I went ahead and made myself an improvised hatchet (got an improvised knife from Poacher's in FM), as well as 8 arrowheads, since I had the resources to do the forging.

I have all the materials for a bow and arrows in Mystery Lake, as well as quality tools, so crafting time for the arrows will be cut in half. I was planning on returning to Mystery Lake from CH *anyway*, so I could go to PV by way of Winding River, and both loot the dam and get the cattails from the river. I think I'll bring a bow.

Long term plan is to knock out the two graves in Timberwolf Mountain and Hushed River Valley, and see if there is enough found food, cattails, and scattered deer carcasses to bide my time to reaching Cooking Level 5. I think if I can get to Cooking 5, it's game over, and I can live on bear for the foreseeable future. I can always bail to Broken Railroad for the last grave if things go south.

If Cooking 5 seems too far of a reach, I was curious if anyone knows if fishing/tip-ups would yield anything on As The Dead Sleep?? 🤔🐟

In the meantime, I'm cooking every can, coffee, and tea I can get my hands on. Once I start harvesting deer, I think I'll take ""shreds"" to have more pieces to cook.

Last Tuesday my school found out that we didn’t have high enough enrollment in kindergarten to justify a 4th kindergarten class. Since I’ve taught 4th and 5th previously at the start of my career, I was voluntold to move to 6th. In my district, 6th is still a part of elementary school. I’ve had a week to set up a new classroom in a portable. But now that it’s mostly ready for students, I’m completely perplexed by how to even start this year. 

I do have a good team, but we have all been busy preparing the physical classroom space or just bonding (like eating lunch, getting coffee or sitting in meetings together) and not had a chance to really collaborate and look over curriculum yet. Our principal is going to give us paid time, but with our personal life schedules, nothing has matched up yet. 

I’ve taught kindergarten - 2nd through past 8 years. I have not taught intermediate grades since pre-covid. 

Please no sympathy. Just solid advice.

Janie knew. She’d known since she was thirteen and her daddy’s hugs started lasting too long. Since he started calling her “baby girl” with a voice that curled like smoke. Since Delores started drinking her coffee with whiskey and locking her bedroom door at night.

By seventeen, Janie had learned how to disappear inside herself. She wore hoodies in July. She stopped dancing. She stopped laughing. But she never stopped watching.

And one night, she stopped waiting.



It was a Tuesday. The kind of night where the air felt thick, like it knew something was about to happen. Janie sat on the porch, legs crossed, pistol tucked in her purse like a secret. Her daddy was inside, watching reruns and sipping bourbon. Delores was in the kitchen, pretending not to hear the way the floor creaked when he walked past Janie’s room.

Janie had found the gun in her uncle’s old shoebox, wrapped in a sock and smelling like motor oil. She’d cleaned it. Learned it. Named it. “Mercy.”

She didn’t want to kill him. She wanted to stop him. But some men don’t stop unless you make them.



She walked in slow. Daddy looked up, eyes glassy, mouth curling into that smile she hated. “What you doin’ up, baby girl?”

Janie didn’t answer. She pulled Mercy from her purse and held it like she’d practiced. Two hands. Steady. No shaking.

His smile cracked. “Now hold on—”

“No,” she said. Just that. One word. Enough.

Delores came running when the shot rang out. She saw the blood first, then the gun, then Janie. And she didn’t scream. She didn’t cry. She just leaned against the wall like her knees forgot how to work.

“You knew,” Janie said, voice low, eyes locked on her mother’s face.

Delores didn’t deny it. She just nodded. Slow. Shameful.

“I thought I could protect you,” she whispered. “I thought if I stayed, he’d leave you alone.”

Janie laughed, but it wasn’t funny. “You thought wrong.”

---

The police came. Janie didn’t run. She didn’t lie. She told them everything. The bruises. The touches. The silence. The gun.

They took her in, but the story spread fast. Neighbors whispered. Reporters came. And somewhere in all that noise, Janie became a symbol. Not just a girl with a gun—but a girl who refused to stay quiet.

She got letters. From girls in Georgia. From women in Detroit. From mothers in Texas who saw their own daughters in Janie’s eyes.

She didn’t want fame. She wanted change.

So she started speaking. At shelters. At schools. She told her story with steel in her voice and fire in her chest. She told them about Mercy. About Delores. About the cost of silence.

And she didn’t flinch when people asked if she regretted it.

“I regret waiting,” she’d say. “I regret thinking I had to survive alone.”



Delores never forgave herself. She tried. She came to Janie’s talks, sat in the back, cried quiet tears. But some wounds don’t heal. Some guilt sticks like tar.

Janie forgave her, eventually. Not because she deserved it, but because Janie needed to let go. Needed to breathe without bitterness.

She kept Mercy, locked in a box, wrapped in velvet. Not as a trophy. As a reminder.

That silence is deadly.

That beauty can be a curse.

That sometimes, the only way to stop a monster is to become something fierce enough to face him.


And Janie? She never danced again. But she walked tall. She spoke loud. And she made sure no girl ever had to feel alone in the dark again.

Because Janie’s got a gun.

And now, she’s got a voice too.",2,1756563615.0,stories,1,1.0,False

""This novel is waiting… who wants to be the first reader?""","# Chapter 1

***Sofia's POV***

""Your keys Miss, rent is due in a month - and remember to make it cash!"" The grumbly caretaker tosses the metal towards me carelessly as I fumble to catch them, swallowing to wet my drying throat.

""Thank you..."" I manage to say, with my voice barely audible, but he nods nonetheless as though he had heard me before making his exit.

He was a stout man, who didn't pride himself much on his appearance by the looks of things, but who was I to judge anyone in this state?

I had managed to land this little apartment for only $350 per month, and although that doesn't sound much to the average person, it really was a lot for somebody who was new to town without a job...

Not to mention my new school that would be taking up most of my time during the week. I would need a night time job no doubt, something convenient to help me make some money - and fast.

I sigh, hearing the front door creak before finally closing over, giving me a proper moment to view the apartment for what it was.

It had nothing in it, no furniture, and the place looked as though it had seen over a thousand crack parties in its time.

I was already wary of my neighbours too who I had passed by on my way inside here. Two men who both stood out in front of the building seeming to smoke something that evidently wasn't normal nicotine or tobacco.

I peered out of the broken blinds, seeing one of them wobble slightly in his high state, before rebalancing himself and going in for another puff - this time from a small pipe that I could see...

Unfortunately, it seemed that one of the men was the top floor resident and the other was the bottom floor - sandwiching me in between them like some cruel prank in our block of three.

I had no choice though, this was the cheapest place I could find and I chose this life for myself... this was my burden to carry and I had to make the most of it at this point because I knew I would never go back home.

I walk towards the tiny kitchen, finding nothing in the cupboards other than some soup tins and so I quickly go back over to my bags which were left in the centre of the floor.

I unzip the one which contained my last small puddle of cash in order to scrutinise just how much I had fucked up thus far...

I had used most of what I took now, and this was my last chance to settle somewhere without them finding me again... and so this has to work!

I pull out my small pink zip purse, opening it to reveal some notes and coins as I slump down on the hard wood floor and tip the contents out.

Taking a second to start counting it, I chew my lip in anticipation for how bad my situation really was this time around... fifty... seventy... ninety...

Pointing to each coin for it to count towards my total, I slump my shoulders slightly and breathe out.

$137...

Not enough for next month's rent but it's something to get me by until I find a job, right?

I check the clock, seeing that it was three in the afternoon, as I push all of my money back inside of the purse - putting it into my bag once again.

I guess it's time to explore my new town - Durango, Colorado.

I was getting further West, but I didn't mind.

Before now, I had just stuck to city hopping, having lived in two already before coming to this place. But they would always manage to hunt me down, like I was a wild animal, and this time around I knew that I had to try a different tactic.

A smaller town would be harder to find and hopefully they would just bypass the place assuming that I would have gone to Vegas or somewhere more extravagant.

I will say though, I did get more for my money in the cities with there being better housing options, but I couldn't grumble - at least I have a roof over my head and a door that locks.

With that, I toss my backpack over my shoulder and head back out - taking the keys and locking the door behind me on my exit.

I quickly rush down the stairs, out in to the bright sun, silencing my two neighbours who eye me curiously with creepy grins.

Thankfully, they say nothing as I pass through the middle of them both, but after a few more steps they both snigger and mutter between themselves - their words inaudible and I wasn't sure if I would have wanted to hear what they were saying either.

I follow a sign towards the town centre, learning quickly that my street seemed to be filled with addicts and drunken people as I passed by, but I didn't mind - as long as they were peaceful and left me out of it that is...

The town itself was gorgeous, far different to the city life, and I got the vibe that this was no doubt a place where everyone knew each other.

I was shocked to find that a couple of blocks away from my own apartment, the streets were lined with ridiculously large extravagant properties and fancy cars, highlighting the wealth that also resided in this small place.

I quickened my step, slightly embarrassed to be walking by the residents who sat out on their front porches to enjoy the sun - with my messy unclean hair and overall scruffy appearance.

I would have to grab some necessities to shower with, or I would face backlash on my first day of school which I didn't want nor need on top of everything else that I had going on. Plus, nobody would hire me looking like this either!

I eventually reached the main town, passing a number of boutique restaurants and coffee shops, before finding a discount store that I quickly swerved into in shame.

The lady on the till seemed surprised when I walked in, but quickly forced a smile to which I returned awkwardly and hurried towards the isles.

Do I look that bad now? I had never let myself get this unkept... but this was nothing more than a result of travelling for eight days straight to get here...

Deciding to put my pride first, I granted myself permission to spend what I had to spend in order to freshen up completely for my first day of school tomorrow.

Glancing across the hair and body products thankful to find that they were pretty cheap, I grabbed a small basket and began to add shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a sponge, toothpaste, a toothbrush, deodorant and a razor to shave with.

Calculating the total in my head, I was relieved to have only spent seven dollars - returning back to the checkout lady with my products.

She looked somewhat guilty, as she scanned each one, glancing over what I had came in here for.

""Uhh listen dear... it's on the house... don't worry about paying today, we all fall into a low place sometimes but you'll pick yourself back up again... I'll cover your total."" The woman's words shock me, as my lips part and my eyes widen.

""N-No I can pay!"" I push, quickly retrieving my purse in embarrassment as she shakes her head and waves me off.

""Put your money to something else, there's a great little thrift store across the road, you could have a look in there? I'll get this."" She pushes, bagging up my products as I gulp and nod slowly.

This was embarrassing, but I couldn't help but feel grateful.

""Thank you... I'm uh, new around here... I just need some time to get on my feet."" I nod quickly, realising that she probably thought I was an addict of some sort looking this way.

""I understand, have a nice day dear..."" She smiles and ignores my rambles, handing me the bag with a soft smile as I thank her once more and hurry out of the store.

Jeez...

I inhale a slow breath, before spotting the thrift store across the road that the lady had spoken of.

Maybe I could go in and use the money I would have spent for a first day school outfit?

I sigh, noticing some girls around my age staring over at me from down the street in confusion. I quickly cross the road, rushing towards the store to get away from their judgemental eyes - hurrying myself inside.

The place was huge, organised in to colours and sizes as I head towards the pinks first to browse. I loved clothes, and at first when I left home I had took most of what I had with me. But each time they found me, I had to flee as quickly as possible which meant that sadly stuff got left behind on the way.

I think I have three outfits and some underwear left, that I could hand wash in the sink when I get back home to freshen up a bit.

I pull out a pink crop top with buttons at the top, and seeing that the shirt was only two dollars I decide to take it.

I also find a baby blue tee, plain with only a white heart on the left hand side. Due to having a small mark on the sleeve it was only a dollar to which I also decide to get it.

It was an odd feeling, shopping for clothes again when it was something I used to enjoy so much but I enjoyed it in here nonetheless. Like every other store though, some of the prices were really great and other prices seemed ridiculous, especially for second hand clothes.

I moved towards the jeans, rummaging through the racks for my size before finding a nice black pair for only five dollars in a 'Mom style' fit.

Ok I can't spend anything else, this was a treat... I decide, as I head towards the checkout desk and count out what I need.

The younger guy watches me, choosing to stay silent since he probably deals with people who look like me every day in here, before I hand him over eight dollars total to which he thanks me and bags the stuff for me.

Leaving, I stop in to the small excursion shop next door finding the different activities and trips you could book in or close to town before my eyes land on a little brochure with a map of town on the back.

Perfect! That would help me find my way around a little better!

I place the pamphlet in my bag, and trudge my way back towards my new empty apartment to freshen up as much as humanly possible for my big day tomorrow...

But I could confirm so far that this place wasn't all bad...",1,1756563535.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,0.66,False

*Where the Glorioso Aim to Rub Salt Into Old Wounds (and Their Own Midfield)*

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Misery**  
Botafogo is the prohibitive favorite here, with odds hovering around **1.55 (decimal)**, implying a **65% chance to win**. For context, that’s about the same probability that your Monday morning coffee will survive the commute unscathed. Bragantino, meanwhile, sits at **+575 (American)**, translating to a **17% chance**—roughly the odds your boss will finally notice you’ve been working from a beach. The draw? A **25% probability**, which feels about right for a Brasileirão match where both teams have more injuries than a mosh pit at a heavy metal concert.

**Team News: When Fatigue Meets Futility**  
Botafogo, the “Glorioso,” are a team in crisis mode. Under Italian coach Davide Ancelotti (yes, that Ancelotti, though he’s less “Real Madrid legend” and more “confused tourist here for the weekend”), they’ve scored just **one goal in their last four matches**. They’ve also sold midfielder Cuiabano to Nottingham Forest, which is like trading your chess queen for a pawn and a sense of dignity. Their recent losses to Cruzeiro and Palmeiras? Less “football” and more “why is this clock moving backward?”

Bragantino, on the other hand, are on a **nine-game winless streak**, a drought so long it’s practically a Brazilian dry season. But hey, they *did* beat Fluminense last time out—proof that even the most cursed teams can occasionally trip a豪门 into submission. Oh, and they’ve already beaten Botafogo **once this season**, thanks to Eduardo Sasha’s lone goal in a 1-0 victory. Botafogo won’t let that haunt them… probably. Unless they’ve all forgotten about it, which

1n42nm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n42nm8,"Review: A normal pre-pandemic experience at the Fairfield in Sheridan, Wyoming. Excellent Ambassador recognition.","I stayed at the Fairfield off Interstate 90 in Sheridan, Wyoming. 

The hotel is a fairly typical example of a Fairfield built in the last 10 years. It underwent a light refresh at some point in the last year or two as it features a newer Fairfield decor — carpeting, wall art, etc. — and the newest iteration of the Fairfield lobby design, particularly the breakfast room. Also, the property's signage is in keeping with Fairfield's rebranding and no longer has ""Inn"" as part of the brand name. The photos on the Marriott website are of the rooms before the refresh.

About two days before arrival I noticed in the Bonvoy mobile application that I had been upgraded into a ""larger room,"" which is basically a junior suite. As I was traveling with someone and didn't want to use a sofa bed, I called the hotel and spoke with the front desk. They put me back into the double queen room that I had booked. Keep in mind that rooms are small. The two-queen room was listed at 338 square feet. With two people and luggage, there's basically no room. I struggled to find a spot to open my 29-inch Away Large suitcase. I ended up putting some luggage and a cooler under the sink countertop in the bathroom.

The hotel itself is located right off the interstate. There's a Spark by Hilton, a dumpy Holiday Inn-turned-Ramada, Candlewood, and a local hotel around the area. Nearby are a bunch of gas stations, fast-food restaurants, Walmart, etc. The Fairfield's biggest competitor is probably the Best Western downtown. There is a new hotel being built that looks like a Holiday Inn Express. So, basically, this is one of your better options in Sheridan.

I was impressed by this property. It was like a normal pre-pandemic hotel stay.

As a Bonvoy Ambassador, I received a handwritten note, two bottles of water and a paper bag with junk food snacks. These were placed in my room and waiting for me. I appreciate the note. While the junk food snacks were well-intended, they aren't something I eat. I don't expect a bottle of wine and a cheese plate at a Fairfield, but I wish the hotel had read my Ambassador preferences, which clearly state that I don't eat these things. 

At check-in I was given the points and told that this property lets Ambassador status guests have unlimited market pantry items. It was reasonably well-stocked with sodas, snacks, ice cream, etc. Kudos to the owner or management. In effect, this becomes a mini-club lounge. Do note: There is no place within walking distance to get an alcoholic drink. It would be nice if the hotel had a beer and wine license to have beer and wine for sale in the market pantry. Some Fairfields have this.

My room was spotless. It was probably the cleanest domestic USA Marriott-branded property that I've seen in years. They've done an excellent job maintaining the product. 

If you stay more than one night, you have to request daily housekeeping. 

In the lobby, there's a kiosk selling assorted Wyoming souvenirs, including postcards, hats, etc. I loved that. I bought a few things. I wish more properties had this. I saw a rack with some local tourist brochures and a guide to local restaurants. I didn't see any newspapers even though I know there's a locally published daily newspaper. There's a fairly large gym that is well-equipped. The pool is on the smaller side. Not having a half-indoor, half-outdoor pool seems like a missed opportunity. There's an outdoor terrace with some furniture but no fire pit.

Breakfast starts at 6 am every day, including weekends. The spread was typical: cheese omelets, scrambled eggs, pork sausage, breads, a waffle machine, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh watermelon, juices from a dispenser, milk, and coffee (two regular varieties and one decaf). My advice is to eat early, as replenishment seemed inconsistent — by 7 a.m., the cheese omelets were already lukewarm. 

My only complaint? 

The hotel has two small airport-style carts for bags. No proper hotel luggage carts. 

All things considered, I would return if in the area and just needed a place to stay for a night on a long road trip. If I returned to spend more than a day in Sheridan, I would probably book the Sheridan Inn. This historic hotel was built by Buffalo Bill back in the day.",1,1756563206.0,marriott,0,0.56,False
