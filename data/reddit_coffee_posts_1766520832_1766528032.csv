Friend group went to an event, and I (25F) went with a guy (27M) I’ve recently gotten closer to over the past 4 months. He’s introverted, really sweet, and friendly with everyone. He had to drop me off late that night, and after I made a joke about Starbucks not being open 24/7, he offered to make me coffee at his place. I didn’t think much of it and said yes.


We were both still dressed up from the event, and I wasn’t very covered. He’s always very respectful + not touchy, so him sitting next to me on the couch, instead of across, caught me off guard. We talked for over an hour facing each other. Nothing happened, but I felt a lot of tension and was pretty nervous, avoiding eye contact most of the time. I eventually apologized for staying so late because I felt like I was intruding. I’m a very awkward person which leads to me avoiding any kind of interaction with men. 

The next day I dropped something off at his place and brought extra cookies I had, but he barely looked at me and made a slightly awkward, pointed comment - “did you happen to just have these cookies?” The day after that, we met again in a group and though he seemed mostly normal, he declined lunch with a vague reason. 

Now I’m worried I’ve caught feelings and may have made things awkward. I don’t plan on saying anything because I don’t want to ruin the friendship, but I can’t stop wondering if that night changed things.",2,1766527921.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

1pu6ll2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pu6ll2/aio_after_my_aunts_husband_said_my_fiancé_did_the/,AIO after my aunt’s husband said my fiancé “did the right thing” by dating a younger woman? (plus other comments),"Hi everyone, I (27F) met my aunt (40F), her husband ""Mark"" (40M), and their two little kids for coffee today. We don't see each other often, maybe once a year, and we don't really keep in contact apart from that.

When I returned home, I noticed that I was feeling very anxious, nauseous even, and I started thinking back to the conversations we had earlier today.

Some things that stood out to me that ""Mark"" said:

* I told them that my little sister (13F) is growing really fast right now and is now taller than me (I'm 5'3""). He made a comment about her maybe having trouble finding a partner later if she gets too tall. I told him I don't think so and I wouldn't care if my partner was shorter than me. He then said that I would care and maybe wouldn't even be with my fiancé if he was shorter than me (he's not very tall btw, around 5'6""). I then said no, I wouldn't care about that but he kept insisting that I'm only saying that because it's easy for me to say as I'm short and I probably wouldn't have dated my fiancé in the first place if he'd been shorter.
   * Side note: I've literally had a conversation some years ago with someone I met online about height, he asked me how tall I am and when I told him he said ""oh, I'm only 5'2"""" (we hadn't met yet). I said I didn't care and we kept texting (and later seeing) each other. So I've literally been in a situation where I could have turned down someone for their height but I didn't because I genuinely don't care.
* He said that my fiancé (38M) ""is doing the right thing by being with a younger woman"". IN FRONT OF my aunt who is the same age as him! That felt very inappropriate to me, and my aunt even tried defending herself by saying that she is a few months younger than him.
* We talked about parenting and he said that their parenting style is very modern without harsh punishment or blackmailing their kids. I said that's great, and he said something like ""I don't know about that, it depends on how you look at it"" and that he and my aunt disagree on that (making it seem like he wants to parent them with those outdated methods but my aunt doesn't). 
* Thinking of all this I remembered a situation that happened when I was maybe 19 or 20. I wore a dress and tights for Christmas because it was cold and I wanted the extra warmth from the tights. They weren't see-through but had an argyle pattern on them. ""Mark"" made a comment about the tights being ""maybe a bit too sexy"" or ""too hot"" to wear around family. I didn't say anything at the time but looking back that seems weirdly sexualising and inappropriate.

So, AIO? I feel mansplained, misunderstood and just downright uncomfortable with some of the things he said. I feel like I didn't make my views and opinions clear enough as I tend to try to keep the peace and don't want to make people uncomfortable. But I wish I had stood up for myself and my values more.",0,1766527749.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

When I stepped off the ship, the shuttle bay was unexpectedly quiet. I understand that the bay needed to be depressurized and cleared out while I landed, but after the 20 minutes of post flight checks I would have figured some people would have come back to continue work. And maybe a few others would gather to welcome me home. Instead, only one lone figure stood at the bottom of the ramp to greet me. 

Susan stood off to one side of the ramp wearing an unexpectedly stern look on her face. My stomach turned a little. Of all the people on board, I would have expected the human who found me and was responsible for getting me hired on as crew would be happier. Yet she simply looked at me with a stern look. 

I started down the ramp, and she watched me descend until my head was nearly level with hers. That was when she made her move.

She came forward on the side of the ramp and wrapped her arms around me, burying her head into my chest and giving me the firmest hug I had ever experienced from a human. I wrapped my arms around her as she held me close. After a long moment in that firm embrace, she broke the silence.

“Don’t you ever scare me like that ever again,” she said softly, her voice muffled by her face being buried in my fur. She then let go, gave me a gentle scritch on the top of my head and pointed to the door.

“Go check in with the captain,” she ordered me in a quiet tone before wiping a tear from her cheek and giving me a smile. “We’ll catch up later.”

I gave her a quick scritch on the top of her head, which earned me a laugh that was more than just music to my ears.

I then jogged off to begin my journey to the captain’s office. The mood on the ship seemed to be focused and professional without many people taking note of me. Everyone seemed intent on completing their tasks. Five minutes later, I arrived at the captain’s office.

“Two cargo crates full of fruit?” Captain Victor exploded at me as soon as he realized it was me entering his office. “I thought after the ship painting incident you would be more mindful of ship credit lines!”

I stopped in shock halfway through the door, and a passing crew member also halted in their tracks at the captain’s outburst. Realizing it was me getting yelled at, they made an eyeroll and kept going about their business. I shrank down a bit and turned to look inside the office at the captain.

“Take a seat,” the captain then growled at me while pointing at one of the empty chairs in front of his desk. “We have much to discuss.”

As I sat down, he came from behind the desk and towered over me while leaning back on his desk. 

“There’s a list of things we need to address.” he said as he looked down at me with an angry scowl. “But first…”

I shrank down in my seat and flinched slightly as he leaned down to put his face next to mine. Then his arms gently slid around me, and he pulled me close.

“Don’t you ever scare us like this ever again or so help me I’ll shave you myself. And then hang you from the embassy flagpole by your tail like you did a certain pair of tighty-whities,” he said as he held me in a firm hug that left no room to question how he really felt. I relaxed and hugged him back for all I was worth.

“The underwear was all Skylar. I had nothing…” I started out before being cut off by a stern look of disapproval as the captain let me go and stood up straight.

“Maybe I thought it wasn't a bad idea so I let her do it?” I offered hesitantly, which got me an eyeroll.

He then handed me a datapad, and we started through all the new issues he felt that needed to be addressed immediately. Like the 1 million credit lien I had unknowingly placed on our new ship. And how my acting career was now in jeopardy thanks to a few fellow actors in the promo shoot complaining to the Actors’ Guild. Next up? The captain had gotten a picture of me running with the ball instead of throwing it for Bruno, so I got a lecture on how to properly play with a dog as well as acceptable and safe treats for human pets.

“Right,” he said. “We’ll have to discuss everything else later as I’ve got a meeting with Auggie in a few minutes. Go check in with Rosa for Engineering Department updates, and then help Jarl unload your cargo.”

“Yes, sir,” I said as I got up and walked out the door. Outside the captain’s office there were a few crew members passing in the hall.

“And don’t you dare ever forget your void suit in a storage locker again!” Captain Victor bellowed out with a roar that made me flinch. 

“Well, that’s a shock. Haasha getting yelled at,” one of the passing crew members commented dryly.

After looking sheepishly at my crewmates, I took off and headed to engineering where I found Rosa waiting. A quick look around told me the engineering department looked far cleaner and more organized than when I left, except for my station which looked completely untouched. Everyone was working quietly and with intense focus on their jobs. Rosa wasted no time shuffling me into her office and going straight into presentation mode.

“Since your unnecessary and unauthorized disappearance, we shifted priorities,” she opened. “You will remain with Jack on the shuttle maintenance rotation. With the new ship aboard, your role shifts from general maintenance to act as primary maintenance technician for the new vessel as well as join Auggie and Enrique on Emergency Response Team 1.”

That assignment was definitely unexpected and I’d ask for clarification later, but now was definitely not the time. Rosa didn’t seem to be in the mood for interruptions. Beyond that, it was exactly what I expected from Chief Engineer Rosa. A detailed, precise, and clear plan of action.

“That is all. You are dismissed. Go complete your cargo assignment with Jarl,” she said with finality.

“Yes, ma’am,” I responded as I got up to leave. 

When I got to the door, I turned back thinking I might ask for more details on the whole Emergency Response Team thing. She was at her desk looking away from the door and I heard her sniffle then reach up to wipe something away from her cheek. I decided I could ask later about the new assignment as it was clear she wanted a moment alone.

Cargo unloading? Jarl stopped in to confirm the crate sizes and quantities. He then called for Clarice and James to assist.

“Welcome back, the new ship looks nice. We’ll discuss shift rotation and active projects tomorrow,” was all he said before giving me just a quick head scritch and leaving to go back to the cargo bay.

The CJ combo were quick and professional in getting things done, but there wasn’t much conversation or the usual banter. They just moved in sync like professional dancers who knew exactly what the other was thinking, and my ship parts and fruit crates were offloaded and delivered in record time. 

Dinner in the mess hall? A number of people offered polite words to welcome me back, yet there seemed to be a bit of a distance. Again, the overall mood of the ship seemed to have shifted to more focused and professional. Food selection was a little lacking, but decent enough. Meatloaf with extra gravy and mashed potatoes which I mixed peas into. Sadly, no fruit tonight.

After an evening in my quarters catching up on ship bulletins, I headed up to the officer’s lounge for my first make-up crew acclimation exercise. I was surprised to see only a handful of crew present rather than the more typical standing room only. As soon as I walked through the door, Auggie rolled the numbered ping pong balls.

“Anna, looks like your night,” he said calmly and she just gave a polite nod in return. 

“Shall we?” she then said to me pointing to the door. I didn’t know Anna well, just that she worked on the science team. I usually get a bit of small talk before crashing for the night, but she was just quiet and polite and there didn’t seem to be much interest in chatting. 

As she laid out a small blanket in the middle of her bed in accordance with the rules, I decided that since I was home I really wanted to cuddle up with one of my human crewmates.

“Mind if I join you?” I asked politely.

“Sure,” she responded with a small smile and climbed into bed. She held up the covers to let me in and I cuddled up with my back against her chest. She flipped the covers down and turned off the light, and while comfy, it didn’t quite feel right.

I lowered my tail down and found her knees, and gently encouraged Anna to bring her knees up so we could cuddle in a tight ball. She got the hint, let out a contented sigh, and we drifted off to sleep in a nice combined pile of warm. 

Anna’s alarm woke us up with about an hour to get up, grab food, and get to our shifts. Sometime during the night we had both shifted around. She was now face down on the bed stretched out and I was flopped over her back completely under the sheets. She made for a reasonable body pillow, if I’m being honest.

“Ugh… Morning,” she groaned out as she rolled onto her back and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She then reached under the covers with her left hand and began to gently scritch my back. After 10 minutes, her second alarm went off and we realized we really should get up for the day.

The way she stumbled down to the refresher with me made it clear she wasn’t any more of a morning person than me, so the lack of conversation wasn’t surprising. I headed to one of the stalls to take care of business, while Anna went to the sinks and started to wash her face. There were a few other people in the refresher, but none of them paid us any mind. At least until something went very wrong.

“What’s a hair doing in my toothpaste? And why is it…” a feminine voice started quietly, and then erupted in irritation. “Anna! You know the rules. Lint roller. Seriously - look at your shirt and tell me how that’s not breaking the rules!”

As I came out of the stall and went to an open sink to wash my hands, I spotted Anna in the mirror with a smug grin and noticed that her navy blue shirt had a bit of a pink haze. 

“How bad is it, Jessie?” a voice called from one of the stalls.

“Bad enough that her shirt looks more light purple than navy blue!” Jessie exclaimed dramatically while shaking her toothbrush at Anna. As I stepped up to a sink to wash my hands, her tone shifted to light and friendly. “Oh, hello Haasha!”

I got a friendly scritching on the shoulder as she went back to expressing her displeasure with Anna for not using a lint roller. The crux of the issue seemed to be that there was an unwritten rule to not brag about how well a crew acclimation exercise went. Anna started to apply some makeup and kept her reply limited to looking smug as I finished up and left the refresher. 

I headed up to the mess hall and made my way towards the serving line. I hadn’t gotten more than 3 steps inside when one of the kitchen staff came out and put a tray in my hands. On it was a healthy serving of scrambled eggs, hash browns covered in maple syrup, and a slice of apple pie with whipped cream. To drink, a glass of orange juice. I looked up to thank them, but they were already gone.

I turned around to look for a place to sit and found the mess hall unusually packed and the mood more boisterous.

Luckily, a group of crew in the back corner called out.

“We’ve got a space over here, Haasha!”

I headed over and they shuffled around a bit to make room. The three biggest humans of the group shuffled to the side of the table with their backs to the door while I sat opposite between my other two crewmates. While they wanted to hear about my adventures off the ship, they felt compelled to fill me in on the important things - current crew gossip! That let me eat uninterrupted, with the plan to get me to spill the beans after the table had been cleared. 

Once the table was cleared, my crewmates glanced around the room.

“Tabletop scritch session?” Helen offered.

“But I’m not allowed on tables anymore,” I responded glumly.

“Why do you think we have Rick, James, and Vlad sitting on that side of the table?” she pointed out. “It’ll be fine. We’re in the corner and you’ve got a wall of meat blocking any view of you.”

I shrugged and got up on the table. I closed my eyes as they started scritching, and I recounted my discovery of the hidden illicit base carved into an asteroid. Suddenly all scritching stopped and hands were withdrawn. I cracked open an eye to see Captain Victor standing at the end of the table with a raised eyebrow and arms crossed. I quietly got off the table and back into my seat trying not to meet his gaze. As soon as I was seated, he walked away and my crewmates asked about what treasure I discovered. There were a few eyerolls from nearby tables.

I was continuing my story about the abandoned smuggler’s den and lab when someone caught everybody’s attention.

“Dang it,” Auggie growled out loudly enough to be heard throughout the mess hall. “My coffee spilled.”

“I didn’t do it!” I blurted out instantly and loudly, which resulted in the room filling with snickering and chuckles.

“Good you’re here, Haasha,” Auggie called out to me. “Your next flight training will be tomorrow afternoon. One hour of parallel parking, two hours of atmospheric flight simulation.”

I sighed at the thought of practicing parallel parking, but at least there would be more sim time on actual flight which would be meaningful. In the meantime, I had a story to share with my crewmates.

“And so I thought about how to announce myself and decided the best way would be to call out, ‘Room service!’ ” I continued. With all the questions my crewmates asked, that part of my trip took longer than expected to describe and we all realized we would need to run to get to our assignments.

As I ran down the hallway to get to the cargo bay, crew members smiled as they saw me coming and put out their hands. Following the rules, I gave them all high-fives as I passed. 

My datapad dinged with an urgent message from Rosa and I stopped to check it. She wanted to go through the Sabaric 951 technical manuals this afternoon. She included a technical diagram for an ideal seating arrangement on her couch intended to maximize knowledge transfer and interpersonal relations. My only thought was that I might need to suggest a minor amendment to the seating if the kink in my left shoulder didn’t work itself out during cargo duties.

Walking into the cargo bay, Jarl was clearly frustrated with me.

“Haasha! We have only 5 minutes to finish up our first task of the day before Auggie gets here for an inspection,” he bellowed out as he pointed to the loader. “Get a move on!”

I saw Clarice standing next to an infoscreen turned into a leaderboard, and then noticed there was a race course set up and the loader was at the starting line. James was looking smug as he currently had the top time. With less than five minutes to wipe that grin off his face, I ran to the loader and fired it up.

It was good to be home!

Today my boyfriend is getting sick of course. I have so much fucking housework to do and Xmas eve is tomorrow. You think he did anything? He got me fast food twice and made me a coffee once. Never asked what my temp was or when I took meds last or anything. Didn't pay any attention to whether I was drinking enough. But guess who will be a whiny baby for days and need somebody to monitor his meds and make sure he is drinking enough. I brought up him having just left me in the bedroom all fucking day one day without ever checking on me and he said if I needed him I should have told him. He has this thing about people speaking up if they need something and not just take care of somebody when they need it. I've told him before that if I was to ever get really sick I would need help making sure I was drinking enough bc I get dehydrated easily. Plus I was out of it with a high fever. 
Oh and we ran out of cat food. So I had to drive my 14 year old to Walmart the day before Xmas eve for cat food. 
I'm so sick of men and even when you think you found a good one you're wrong. 
And y'all, this flu this winter is no joke! I have not been this sick in like 13 years and that only lasted one day. It's extremely rare for me to get so sick my brain goes!

Called my bank and they were like ""oh yeah we flagged your account for suspicious activity"" even though I literally told them before I left that Id be traveling.



  
This keeps happening. Mexico City, Buenos Aires, now Thailand. Every single time I have to spend like an hour on the phone with some rep who barely understands what a digital nomad is and then they unblock it and promise it wont happen again but here we are.



  
Ive tried Wise but honestly the transfers take forever sometimes and I need access to my money NOW not whenever they feel like processing it. PayPal works but the fees are insane especially for currency conversion, like im already spending enough on flights and coworking spaces i dont need to give PayPal 5% of everything.



  
Is there literally any card or payment solution that just works everywhere without getting blocked every time you cross a border? Im bouncing between LATAM and SE Asia pretty regularly and I just need something reliable that doesnt think im committing fraud every time I buy a coffee in a different country.",0,1766527380.0,digitalnomad,3,0.5,False

1pu6g67,https://i.redd.it/muuxcols019g1.jpeg,Help with decreases on Mood beanie,"
I am working on the Mood beanie by Spektakelstrik. I am new to color work and I’m quieter stumped. 

The pattern has a color chart of 10 stitch repeats, so l placed markers at every 10 sts. The decrease directions are above.
What I don't understand is...
• how do I keep following the color chart when I've decreased and I have less than 10 sts between my pattern repeat markers? Saying ""just read your knitting"" and keep following the pattern you see is not helpful.
My second round of decreases calls for all one color, so there's not a pattern I can follow by reading my knitting.
• what do I do when the st before my marked st is on one side of my pattern repeat markers? Now where does that marker go?
Please be gentle. Anyone who can help me through this is getting a coffee on me :)

He’s introverted, really sweet, and friendly with everyone. He had to drop me off late that night, and after I made a joke about Starbucks not being open 24/7, he offered to make me coffee at his place. I didn’t think much of it and said yes.


We were both still dressed up from the event, and I wasn’t very covered. He’s always very respectful + not touchy, so him sitting next to me on the couch, instead of across, caught me off guard. We talked for over an hour facing each other. Nothing happened, but I felt a lot of tension and was pretty nervous, avoiding eye contact most of the time. I eventually apologized for staying so late because I felt like I was intruding. I’m a very awkward person which leads to me avoiding any kind of interaction with men. 

The next day I dropped something off at his place and brought extra cookies I had, but he barely looked at me and made a slightly awkward, pointed comment - “did you happen to just have these cookies?” The day after that, we met again in a group and though he seemed mostly normal, he declined lunch with a vague reason.

I am building my first N scale layout, and want to get feedback on this design

\-2'x4' base  
\-All radii are 9.75"" (other than the right side outer loop which is 11""  
\----Note that this track will likely be using a GP40 and small/medium rolling stock so I don't think those radii will be an issue  
\-DC setup with only one loco pulling 3-4 cars  
\-Track is Atlas code 80 flex track  
\-All of this is one layer, I would make custom make the diamond crossings to incorporate all the curves at the intersections  
\-The outer left rail will have a mountain/tunnel over it with a side opening on the left wall  
\-I am looking for continuous running and don't fancy switches/interchanges that much  
\-In terms of design, I plan on doing a mostly forest scene with 1 or 2 roads (maybe logging routes)

so background

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

i dont wanna game i dont wanna read i dont wanna sleep i dont wanna watch a serie or movie

and my mom will be councling the dr about it but thats tommorow since he aint working rn but i swear to god if he suggest changing meds im gonna lose it these are the 3rd also had zoloft/sertralin and aripiprazol im on meds for 4 ish years rn and the going down in slowly dossage to start the other one is hell everytime i just hope i dont need to.. again

even tough i already feel fucked rn

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

**23 - I’ll be Home for Christmas**

Wednesday watched Enid skip off back towards the huts and then moved to sit down at a picnic table nearby. Thing dropped from her shoulder onto the table and signed a question at her.

“No, it isn’t where I’d choose to spend my time but Enid seems to be enjoying it. I could have done without the photoshoot, however.” More signing from the hand, “Yes. It was pleasant. Don’t go thinking I’ll be keen to hold any other hands anytime soon.” She said, glaring down at him.

She watched shoppers and children milling around full of excitement for the season as she did her best to glower at the crowds and discourage anyone from trying to wish her a Merry Christmas. She was already starting to get irritated at having to wait but this was for Enid, so she got herself a cup of coffee and continued to await the werewolf’s return.

It was about another half an hour before worry began to creep in to her mind. Surely she should have been done by now, had something happened? Perhaps she was being paranoid, but Wednesday had learned to heed her feelings. “Thing, we’re going to look for her.” She said and stood, but the hand signed a warning, “No, I am not trying to see what gift she is buying me. I’m concerned that something has happened to her.”

They set off in the direction that Enid had gone, Wednesday scanning the crowds for a familiar flash of pink and blonde hair. Her concern only grew as she could see no sign of the werewolf, until she was practically running down the rows with wide eyes, worry etched on her usually emotionless face. “Thing, she’s not here. She’s gone.”

She was starting to feel panic rising within her, but she pushed it down and tried to focus. Try and retrace her steps, think like Enid. She’d spent a day in the girl’s body earlier that year and she still felt the marks that they’d left on each other. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, thinking about what Enid would have done.

She picked a row of huts that appealed to her for reasons she couldn’t articulate and started walking down it, more slowly this time, looking for clues or indications of what might have happened. They were about half way down the row when Thing jumped off her shoulder and scuttled into the bushes nearby. He quickly emerged holding onto something small and square. Wednesday reached down and took it from him, seeing that it was the polaroid of her and Enid standing either side of Santa from earlier that day.

Surely there’s no way she would have thrown it away, perhaps she dropped it by accident, Wednesday considered the options. She quickly decided on a course of action and gripped the polaroid tightly, closing her eyes and focusing her mind on the object in her hand and the impressions left on it by her friend.

Her ability kicked in and suddenly she felt like an observer as the world dissolved and shifted around her. She was back in the tent when the polaroid was handed over to a smiling Enid. Then the two of them were outside, Enid saying she was going off by herself. Wednesday looked around for any clues, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.

The world shifted again and she was standing near the spot where Thing had found the photo. Enid was looking at some items lined up on the shelf of a hut when a figure approached her from behind. Wednesday instantly recognised her as Esther Sinclair. Instinctively she shouted a warning into nothingness as she say Enid’s mother withdraw a syringe from her pocket and jab it into Enid’s back.

Wednesday could only watch as Enid wobbled and put her hand up to her head, she looked like she was about to collapse when the older woman grabbed her arm and steadied her, and began half dragging, half leading her away from the market.

The Christmas Market dissolved and they were in a parking lot, with Esther leading Enid forward towards an unmarked van. Other figures were there now, Wednesday recognized two or three of the werewolf pack from Nevermore including Jake Carter who was now roughly pushing Enid into the back of the van.

Suddenly the world dropped away and Wednesday was jerked back into reality, all the breath sucked out of her. She staggered forward for a moment but caught herself before she fell. Thing signed at her out of concern, “The Sinclair pack have her. They took her to a van in that parking lot,” she indicated the area beyond a nearby row of trees, “I got the licence plate.”

Thing quickly climbed back on to her shoulder and they ran back through the huts to where Lurch was waiting with the car. They jumped in and Wednesday told him to drive. She was trying to focus on the polaroid again to get a sense of direction but she was struggling to sense more than “East”, so she instructed Lurch to go as fast as he could to the east, looking out for an unmarked van with the licence plate she had seen in her vision.

She didn’t know how much time they had. Would the pack try and deal with her here, or take her back to San Francisco to do the deed? Either way, Wednesday was under time pressure - it wouldn’t be long before Enid was out of her reach.

Thing tried patting her reassuringly on the shoulder but she glared at him. “Don’t patronise me, I’m not losing her again. I promised her that she would have a home with us, and I *will* have her home for Christmas.”

You know that? You are so good at finding the breaks in my train of thought that I have to really stay on track to be nice to you. I’ve voided as much inauthentic “fluff” as possible and I’m still left with quite the word salad. So basically, this is a great ENTP post by format alone. I’ve had enough Ne for today and I’m not going to post this if I don’t like it so if you’re reading it, I believe it’s worth your time. If it isn’t, most ENTP’s appreciate a good prank so… Gotcha nerd! You had faith in an ISTP! What were you thinking? Now to business:

My series before this one “An attempt to make each type feel seen by an ISTP” was something I had so much confidence in. I still think it’s worth a read for any ENTP:

[ https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/s/m8eVkdLIvy ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/s/m8eVkdLIvy)

Something I touched on and I’m still struggling to learn about is that Ne/Si. To you, it’s just you. To me it’s a flamethrower. I’m very controlled for the most part. Ne just seems to EXPLODE but it finds a way to return to a grounded state in Si. How? Is it a boomerang on purpose? At all? It’s like someone says “We need to try something else” to literally anything and you say “here’s 42 ideas, and from that 21 plans to execute, so 10 that fit what you’re wanting most, and I can’t tell you how you’re feeling about each one so pick one and I’ll object to make sure you really want it then it’ll be what we go with, cool?” And when someone Ne’s that hard and fast, I just want to condescendingly stroke my own ego and say “Sir, this is a Wendy’s.” Flamethrowers are such chaos when you pull the trigger but once they are off, it’s like clearing a haze. They cover so much area at once and then just aren’t there anymore. I’m sure over time with practice you learn how to use it and keep yourself practical but it sounds like torture to me. Obviously I’m Ne blind so it makes rational sense that I feel that way. That doesn’t make me less amazed by your existence.

I can’t help but wonder to myself though, “is it torture? Is their brain the beehive it feels like it is and they have just learned to deal with it?” Honestly, I think it is. \_\_\_\_\_ <— I put this break here because I’m at a coffee shop and a doctor in scrubs that looks kinda raggedy came in to place an order. He asked 100 questions and was a little condescending with the barista. Overall, I’m going to assume he’s ENTP for the sake of the point I’m trying to make (and the beauty in the coincidence it would point out). He’s only got one button that’s barely holding on for his little Martingale looking thing on his scrubs. He’s not shaved in a few days and his grey/white hair is everywhere (what’s left of it).

Crawling on the back of his scrubs top was a ladybug. It was kinda big for a ladybug. I could see it easily from 15 feet away. It took me a second to decide to interact with this stranger, especially to point out to someone with “MD” sewed into their scrubs that they had an insect crawling on them. Nonetheless, I did. I got up,  walked clear across the shop to get a napkin and then all the way back to him. I said “sorry sir, you picked up a ladybug outside.” He said “oh, hah! How bout that?” I put it outside. He continued his interaction and eventually purchased a gift card and left. 2 days before Christmas, I imagine he was getting it for someone else after trying to decide what anyone would want from here.

You all appreciate honest and authentic feedback more than anyone. Some version of “I see how that fits,” is your response to it. And as “nice” as it sounds, authentic and honest feedback can be quite brutal and people don’t appreciate it as much as they want to pretend they do (you know this better than anyone). Had I stopped that doctor on his way out to say “man you look pretty disheveled today, you alright?” his reaction/response would probably tell me more about if he really could be ENTP. Maybe he would joke about having an insect crawling on him or maybe he would get offended and insult me back before resuming his day. If you spend any amount of time on the ENTP sub, it doesn’t take long to see how “mean” you are to each other without taking any offense. And that’s why you don’t take offense: it’s honest; it’s clear. There’s no guesswork in figuring out someone’s true feelings they might otherwise hide. Even when you don’t think “I see how that fits,” I imagine you say “I can maneuver you better now, thank you.”  You judge yourself so harshly on your actions as a result of your assessment that you appreciate the accuracy of others when assessing you more than you are offended by their diagnosis that paints you in a negative way. And the most deep and accurate assessments do something you’re not always ready for: it paints a better picture of you to yourself (and you are constantly learning this).

Something you have in common with the ESxJ’s (stay with me here) is that you will exhaust yourself for the sake of others. I’ve seen this so many times from ENTP’s. You’ll let yourself deteriorate in service of the pursuit of an Fe “harmony” you may never reach. Despite how many beehives you’re letting “buzz” around in your mind or flamethrowers you haven’t cut off to let yourself experience peace, you’re always going to secretly carry around something everyone else sees but you don’t. For him it was a cute little ladybug. For you, it’s cute little you.

As an ISTP, I have always resisted every attempt from others to take care of me. My poor ENFP mom loves to baby me even now as a grown adult married with 3 kids. I immediately resist it. This has not been my experience with ENTP’s. While I identify with your hard exterior, the nurturing and soothing many of you need to help quiet the chaos created by the beehives you are afraid to lose track of is something I get lost on. But that also makes sense just like you as a flamethrower: you blast off and eventually find rest. Manufactured peace is still peace and cute little you needs it.

You finding that peace with INFJ’s makes even more sense. Their tolerance for being terrorized (if needed) for the sake of the needs of others is their thing. Look at them as early childhood teachers, social workers, etc. The unpredictability of the intensity of Ne and how good its relationship with Si will be that day requires flexibility in order for  them to see that cute little lady bug hiding behind you. By nature, you’re just trying to make things better for everyone. You’re trying to make the burden of anyone else’s “beehives” feel easier to deal with. The energy you bring to accomplish that comes so hard and fast that it isn’t always received how you meant it.

I imagine this is why we struggle to connect at times. I’m usually carrying 0-1 beehives at a time and my “flamethrower” is more of a stick lighter. And because of this, many ENTP’s look at me and assess what need they would be for me in my life and say “he’s good.”  My tiny lighter doesn’t need a flamethrower and I’m ignorant to everyone else’s “beehives” so it’s best to just let me be ignorant. I feel that.

We still are of use to one another though. The peace my lack of Ne brings is something that would threaten you at first but (despite how it may feel) you’ll never be less essential. You \*could\* however be more peaceful internally. Likewise, I’ll never be so involved that I cannot find peace, but I should be more involved and explore my world more thoroughly to see what it needs from me.

As per usual, I have no idea how this will be received. Could just be a ramble you couldn’t finish. I’m hoping my authenticity kept you engaged. This post is what the title says: “what I notice and what I feel.” And while I’ve always felt an overall disconnect to your type, I will always appreciate you and your type. Your necessity is as undeniable as you want it to be. The world literally needs you to continue to exist. I still like to look for that cute little lady bug though… bringing it outside makes me feel like the human you are isn’t as tortured or filled with unquenched hope as you seem, like the peace you bring is something you allow yourself to feel as well. Precision requires that peace whether you’ve learned to shoot through it or not.

I've been taking Lexapro for GAD and panic for about 5 years, and am curious to see if - like some folks I've read about here - the root of my anxiety really stems from ADHD and overwhelm. My psych originally prescribed Vyvanse, as there was concern that Adderall would heighten my anxiety too much. However, my insurance wouldn't cover Vyvanse, so we are going with Adderall XR. I've been sitting with the pills on my dresser for over a week, afraid to take. 

I assume on day one I should:
- Abstain from coffee
- Have someone with me in case I don't respond well 
- Avoid the gym? Or should I go? Will my heart explode? I powerlift and have a history of physical fitness so I *think* I'm ok, but are there risks to heavy exercise and Adderall? 

What did you do on day 1 or week 1 that helped? How long of a trial did you give meds to see if they were a good fit? 

Ok that was more than one question! Thank you for your time and help :)",2,1766526113.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

That's a $2k raise I just gave myself going into 2026. Every dollar is now going toward paying off debt and building assets instead of auto-renewing subscriptions I don't use.

Honestly, I never felt so happy and so dumb all at the same time.  Glad to ""get the raise,"" but kicking myself for letting subscriptions linger like that.

It was originally done in Italian and published inside a paid Substack newsletter. This is the translation.
“D” is Daniela Collu an Italian author, G is Giovanni.

G – At some point, I think you also have to let go and tell the truth, at least a little.

D – Oh, so we’re telling the truth now?

G – Always. Also because I have a terrible memory, so if I lie, I forget the lies.

D – Giovanni, the problem isn’t that you lie. It’s that, to you, those lies are the truth.

G – Well… our versions are always our truth, our point of view… (laughs) Let’s start!

D – Alright. Giovanni Calvario, thank you for welcoming us into what you called “the wolf’s den.”

G – Welcome to the wolf’s den.

D – How are you?

G – Very well. I’m discovering all these labels, these Anglicisms tied to new online trends. What is gaslighting? What is a red flag? I was completely disconnected from this terminology. Love bombing is my favorite term, incomprehensible. What is it?

D – Well, some people would say that’s exactly what you did with the women in the pods.

G – What I do is courtship. I experience courtship very intensely. I’d rather have a beautiful date that maybe ends badly because there’s no chemistry, than do what many friends do, grabbing a quick coffee in some suburban bar hoping to have sex right after. If that’s love bombing, fine. I’ve always preferred a romantic way of living. I try to create a beautiful experience every time. Is that love bombing?

D – I think love bombing is when you load that courtship with such a unique, special aura that it creates strong expectations in the other person.

G – And what’s wrong with that? I play a mental game. I think, what if this were the last one? What if this person were the last woman in my life, the one I marry? What would I tell my grandchildren? That I won her over with a cheap beer in a sketchy bar? No. I’d like to say I wrote her a letter, read her a poem, gave her a beautiful gift, and now here we are. That’s how I want to tell the story.

D – So you live to tell yourself a story?

G – Not to myself. I want people to be inspired, like the mentors in my life inspired me, to become better people. I grew up in the far outskirts of Rome. My mentors pushed me to grow. I’d like to give that back, even in love, to a future family.

D – You live a very full, very rich life, socially too. You organize events. Just looking at this house, it’s clearly made to welcome people, to share.

G – …the patron.

D – The bon vivant. How do you go around now knowing there’s a sort of TripAdvisor review hanging over your head, a huge negative one, even with women?

G – I think from now on it will help me distinguish between those who only look at the surface and those who have the courage to go deeper and see what’s behind the villain, the big bad guy. It already does. You’d be surprised how many people are intrigued, attracted by wanting to understand what’s underneath. Yes, there’s a shitstorm, but there’s also a private world of people looking for connection, and that’s just as fascinating.

D – Let’s remember Charles Manson received love letters in prison, so of course people will still go on a date with you. There’s room for everyone.

G – (laughs) Exactly.

D – This was a unique experiment. What do you remember from the days in the pods?

G – I remember the smell. That’s why I gave incense as a gift, the same one I used in the pods, trying to recreate a familiar scent, to avoid the “IKEA showroom” effect of trying to fall in love with just a voice. It was a very small room, like a womb, and you’re constantly tested. On one hand, you have to like the other person, and on the other, you have to somehow be liked. It’s a constant challenge to open yourself, to open the other, to connect. Something unimaginable in real life. It really struck me, because with each woman you have to say who you are, and at the same time ask who she is, in just a few minutes. That made a huge difference and led to me having many matches, there’s no denying that.

D – It also felt very common for people to go in and play their cards. In courtship, we all bring out our favorite movie, the book we know best, the poem that represents us. I absolve you of that. But when it’s told in such a theatrical, sentimental way, like a precious gift coming from above, from such a layered and rich personality, it becomes humiliating for the women when they later compare notes in the lounge and realize they received the same thoughts, the same attention, the same gifts.

G – First of all, I’ve never sought absolution for what came after. I know I’m a complex person and I show myself without fear. What hurts me is being called fake. A manipulator, to me, is someone lurking in the shadows, acting through deceit. I knew perfectly well that the women talked to each other in the lounge. I wasn’t “caught.” I gave four gifts to the four women I had a bond with, because that’s my way, my love language. Giving myself to the other. But I did other things too, also for Giorgia. Have you ever seen Patch Adams? I picked up on a quote from the film. When the characters had to take a genetics test, I filled her pod with balloons, read her a Neruda poem, we played at building our DNA helices together. That’s my way of courting, it involves play and beautiful experiences. And on the other side, I want the same. I want to know her world, which doesn’t have to be like mine. Actually, I don’t want it to be like mine. I want to admire a woman with a deep inner life.

D – I always say the world is divided between those who say “I love him because he’s special” and those who say “I love him because he makes me feel special.” Do you really think you left space for the women, and then for Giorgia, to tell their own stories?

G – Very much so. You have to consider that we had many hours there. I listen a lot when the other person wants to share. And let’s not forget, a couple is made by two people. She also has to reveal her world. With Giorgia, this was always missing. In the end, she was afraid to show herself. I never met her friends, her home, her parents.

D – But Giovanni, you never even entered her home.

G – That’s not true. One night, because I was in Rome for work.

D – There was a very symbolic scene. She comes home, you’re waiting with your back turned, extremely theatrical, wearing this elegant Chinese-style jacket. What are you, James Bond?

G – (laughs) Mission China. She had already entered the house without me knowing, but we were constantly in touch. I have work responsibilities, I can’t just disappear. I asked production, and her especially, if I could go back to Rome for a day, and the answer was yes.

D – It seemed like she was taking a big step, starting this cohabitation on her own. The premises and promises had been very different. You arrived carrying quite a heavy load.

G – Life has to be light, but it’s also made of responsibility. A relationship that stays in a bubble is worth nothing. It was essential to leave the bubble and enter real life, to see who we really are.

D – Back to the pods. When you couldn’t see each other, narrowing it down, your interest focused on three women: Giorgia, Gergana, and Federica.

G – They represent three aspects of life that I really like. With Gergana, I found lightness and humor. We were very complicit. She called me Bruce Wayne, she was Catwoman. The idea was to steal all the diamonds, and cubic zirconia, in the world. She was also very traditional. Federica struck me for her cultural and spiritual side. We talked about exhibitions, art, yoga, runes. In Giorgia, I saw a very serious, strong, intelligent woman who challenged me. She wasn’t a friend, she was someone to talk about the future with. She could put me in crisis, ask the right questions, sometimes too excessively. Sometimes you have to make peace with things. I only pursued those three. With the others, the conversations were superficial and brief. So it makes me laugh when people say I did the same things with everyone. Either I’m the greatest seducer in the world, or what could I possibly have said in eight minutes to make a woman mine? The real point is that, unlike the other men, I completely skipped the silly questions we were encouraged to ask. “Do you like milk or dark chocolate?” I don’t care.

D – Because you went straight to “My dream is to have a castle with horses where I host cultural festivals. Would you give up your job to follow me?”

G – No. My question was “What is your dream?” I wasn’t talking about work. From a person’s dream, you can read their destiny, what they want from life. Some bet everything on career, some wanted a family, some had no dream at all.

D – When Giorgia told you her dream was to have a riding stable and work with horses, something that could fit with yours, you started questioning its feasibility. But Giovanni, isn’t love believing we’ll make it even when the odds say we won’t? Isn’t it telling a geneticist, “Yes, my love, we’ll have horses”?

G – But then it’s no longer a dream, it’s an illusion. I believe a dream is real only if it becomes someone’s destiny, if you put it into practice. Otherwise, it’s just a story. When I say I want to live in the countryside, I call it a castle because we’re all children of Disney, but a shack would be fine too. I want to raise a family in nature. If the person in front of me doesn’t want to leave the city, it’s unlikely there’s a middle ground. Gergana wanted to live in central Rome, no surprise there. Giorgia told me, “I want to leave everything and open a riding stable by the sea.” Beautiful, absolutely. But is it true? Are our dreams real or just fantasies? She’s pragmatic, and so am I. Do we really want to do this? I’d have to give up a certain social life. It involves sacrifices. You get your hands dirty. You wake up early.

D – Giovanni, have you ever been in love?

G – …with her?

D – With anyone.

G – Yes. A few times, but I have been in love.

D – And when that happened, didn’t you feel the urge to help her reach the end of any project, even if it didn’t fit perfectly?

G – Of course. And that’s what I’ve always done in my relationships.

D – Why didn’t you do it this time?

G – There were many factors, not just the dream. I’ve always supported my partners. I want a woman I can admire. A woman who does things, not just professionally, but beautiful things. My queen bee. That’s what I hoped Giorgia would be.

D – Giova’, look at me. The issue is that you didn’t like her.

G – Physically, I wasn’t attracted to her. She’s very different from the type I’m usually drawn to. She’s a beautiful woman, undeniably. But everyone has their preferences. I calmly told her that the spark hadn’t happened. She replied, “Let’s try.” And I said okay, because sometimes it happens that way. Even between friends, a complicity can suddenly change one evening. There was intimacy between us. Even without final sexuality, intimacy was always there. It’s not that I disliked her or felt repulsed.

D – You slept together, you hugged at night?

G – Of course. There wasn’t an explosion of passionate chemistry or incredible sexuality. But it would have been wrong to fake it or flaunt it like the other men on the show did. It didn’t happen. So what should I have done, if not say, “Let’s try”?

D – Is there a mistake you think you made?

G – I failed to create light moments. Even in romantic moments, everything with her felt heavy. Not bad, but solemn. A hundred questions. “Giovanni, now let’s talk about abortion for an hour.” Lightness was missing. It didn’t help create complicity. We entered a loop where we were deep friends, talking all night, but without that desire to tear each other’s clothes off.

D – Would you really have married her? Someone who believes in the sacrament, in the value of family, who holds up the solid example of his grandparents, would really marry someone met on a TV show?

G – I believe in miracles. So why not? I’ve done crazy things in my life that led to wonderful experiences. I put my face on it, I jump in, for better or worse, risking getting hurt. Why can’t you get married after a month? Love at first sight exists.

D – If you could go back, would you choose Gergana?

G – No. I have no regrets about my choices. Gergana was light and fun, we would have had a great time, but I could never go deep on anything. She was very accommodating, focused on me. I invited her to talk about herself.

D – It’s hard to believe that, because the impression many of us had was of a man who wants to be adored, loved, seen.

G – Seen, yes. But being seen is both a gift and a curse. You can’t hide. If you’re in the front row, you see the show, but everything hits you too. That’s how I live. Giorgia was my choice. The one I wanted. There was no chemistry, no real connection. Our worlds were too different. There was no shared dream. Should I have taken her to the altar and said no, in front of our families? And she, as a scientist, doesn’t believe in the spiritual aspect of marriage, which I believe in deeply. For her, it’s a civil act, equivalent to cohabitation. It scares me not to share spirituality with my partner. A Viking druid or a Thai monk would be fine. I want a spiritual person in front of me. And sometimes she belittled my habits, my things. I never did that to her. It’s not my way. I observe you, then I decide if I like you or not. But I’ve never offended or humiliated her. What’s the point of humiliating your partner?

D – Sometimes people push the other person to do what they themselves don’t want to do, to take responsibility for the breakup, without being the final straw, so they come out clean.

G – I’m very decisive. I don’t leave life choices to others. I’m not afraid to say or do what I want. I didn’t play the victim. That would be distorting reality. On the first day of living together, I told her I felt no chemistry, that I was struggling. I told her I was sorry, and that for me we could have ended it there if she felt uncomfortable, and we’d each go back to our own homes. I didn’t put anyone in a position to leave me. I told the truth. It didn’t work.

D – What truth came out about you? If we saw a show, what did we see of the real Giovanni?

G – One facet. They captured parts of a much broader personality. I know I’m very theatrical. I like to take emotions to the extreme, for myself and for those around me. I like to bring out what’s true, and the mask allows you to do that. Behind a mask, you say what you want to say.

D – You’re called a pathological narcissist all day long. How are you dealing with it? It seems like you’re responding with sarcasm and turning it to your advantage, but people have been harsh.

G – With irony. What they see on screen is a character, not the person. Not because I was acting, but because they don’t know me. They’ve never had dinner with me. They’re not talking with me like we are now. I can separate things. Sometimes there’s a lot of pain behind those comments. Sometimes they’ve truly been with manipulative men. Social media gives you a place to vent. “You’re disgusting. You’re a red flag.” For them, there’s me and then all the great villains of history. Can life really be that grotesque? How else should I take it, if not with irony? A guy who sunbathes in a linen shirt, what kind of monster is that? A guy who reads Neruda, what kind of villain is that?

D – Are you in love?

G – I’m getting to know someone. Love is a premature word.

D – Has she seen the show? What does she think?

G – We laughed about it a lot.

Giorgia told me, “I want to leave everything and open a riding stable by the sea.” Beautiful, absolutely. But is it true? Are our dreams real or just fantasies? She’s pragmatic, and so am I. Do we really want to do this? I’d have to give up a certain social life. It involves sacrifices. You get your hands dirty. You wake up early.

D – Giovanni, have you ever been in love?

G – …with her?

D – With anyone.

G – Yes. A few times, but I have been in love.

D – And when that happened, didn’t you feel the urge to help her reach the end of any project, even if it didn’t fit perfectly?

G – Of course. And that’s what I’ve always done in my relationships.

D – Why didn’t you do it this time?

G – There were many factors, not just the dream. I’ve always supported my partners. I want a woman I can admire. A woman who does things, not just professionally, but beautiful things. My queen bee. That’s what I hoped Giorgia would be.

D – Giova’, look at me. The issue is that you didn’t like her.

G – Physically, I wasn’t attracted to her. She’s very different from the type I’m usually drawn to. She’s a beautiful woman, undeniably. But everyone has their preferences. I calmly told her that the spark hadn’t happened. She replied, “Let’s try.” And I said okay, because sometimes it happens that way. Even between friends, a complicity can suddenly change one evening. There was intimacy between us. Even without final sexuality, intimacy was always there. It’s not that I disliked her or felt repulsed.

D – You slept together, you hugged at night?

G – Of course. There wasn’t an explosion of passionate chemistry or incredible sexuality. But it would have been wrong to fake it or flaunt it like the other men on the show did. It didn’t happen. So what should I have done, if not say, “Let’s try”?

D – Is there a mistake you think you made?

G – I failed to create light moments. Even in romantic moments, everything with her felt heavy. Not bad, but solemn. A hundred questions. “Giovanni, now let’s talk about abortion for an hour.” Lightness was missing. It didn’t help create complicity. We entered a loop where we were deep friends, talking all night, but without that desire to tear each other’s clothes off.

D – Would you really have married her? Someone who believes in the sacrament, in the value of family, who holds up the solid example of his grandparents, would really marry someone met on a TV show?

G – I believe in miracles. So why not? I’ve done crazy things in my life that led to wonderful experiences. I put my face on it, I jump in, for better or worse, risking getting hurt. Why can’t you get married after a month? Love at first sight exists.

D – If you could go back, would you choose Gergana?

G – No. I have no regrets about my choices. Gergana was light and fun, we would have had a great time, but I could never go deep on anything. She was very accommodating, focused on me. I invited her to talk about herself.

D – It’s hard to believe that, because the impression many of us had was of a man who wants to be adored, loved, seen.

G – Seen, yes. But being seen is both a gift and a curse. You can’t hide. If you’re in the front row, you see the show, but everything hits you too. That’s how I live. Giorgia was my choice. The one I wanted. There was no chemistry, no real connection. Our worlds were too different. There was no shared dream. Should I have taken her to the altar and said no, in front of our families? And she, as a scientist, doesn’t believe in the spiritual aspect of marriage, which I believe in deeply. For her, it’s a civil act, equivalent to cohabitation. It scares me not to share spirituality with my partner. A Viking druid or a Thai monk would be fine. I want a spiritual person in front of me. And sometimes she belittled my habits, my things. I never did that to her. It’s not my way. I observe you, then I decide if I like you or not. But I’ve never offended or humiliated her. What’s the point of humiliating your partner?

D – Sometimes people push the other person to do what they themselves don’t want to do, to take responsibility for the breakup, without being the final straw, so they come out clean.

G – I’m very decisive. I don’t leave life choices to others. I’m not afraid to say or do what I want. I didn’t play the victim. That would be distorting reality. On the first day of living together, I told her I felt no chemistry, that I was struggling. I told her I was sorry, and that for me we could have ended it there if she felt uncomfortable, and we’d each go back to our own homes. I didn’t put anyone in a position to leave me. I told the truth. It didn’t work.

D – What truth came out about you? If we saw a show, what did we see of the real Giovanni?

G – One facet. They captured parts of a much broader personality. I know I’m very theatrical. I like to take emotions to the extreme, for myself and for those around me. I like to bring out what’s true, and the mask allows you to do that. Behind a mask, you say what you want to say.

D – You’re called a pathological narcissist all day long. How are you dealing with it? It seems like you’re responding with sarcasm and turning it to your advantage, but people have been harsh.

G – With irony. What they see on screen is a character, not the person. Not because I was acting, but because they don’t know me. They’ve never had dinner with me. They’re not talking with me like we are now. I can separate things. Sometimes there’s a lot of pain behind those comments. Sometimes they’ve truly been with manipulative men. Social media gives you a place to vent. “You’re disgusting. You’re a red flag.” For them, there’s me and then all the great villains of history. Can life really be that grotesque? How else should I take it, if not with irony? A guy who sunbathes in a linen shirt, what kind of monster is that? A guy who reads Neruda, what kind of villain is that?

D – Are you in love?

G – I’m getting to know someone. Love is a premature word.

D – Has she seen the show? What does she think?

G – We laughed about it a lot.

I know I have to drive for some errands, so I check to see if my car successfully completed the software update I set it to do overnight.  All good there.  I go to the kitchen for my morning coffee, and notice my Echo Show continues to tell me to update to Alexa+, whatever that is.  I've been ignoring it for weeks.  I grab my coffee and go to the living room and turn on the TV.  My LG TV again tells me it wants me to update.  I know this is the version with Copilot in it, so I've been avoiding doing it, but I'm tired of the nag so I say OK.  It will update when I turn it off.

I get a knock at the door.  It's the delivery of the (refurbished) iPhone I've bought my mother-in-law for Christmas.  It's an older model, so the first thing I have to do is check the IOS version.  It's on 18.6, so I spend the next half an hour researching if I should update to version 26 or not.  No consensus.  I put off the decision until I end up setting it up for her.

Time for my lunch workout in the garage.  I sit on the bike and open the app to send it my workout.  Time for a PM5 firmware update! Which, since I have a rower and skier from the same company, means should update those too.  I update the rower and skier while on the bike.  I've left my phone in the garage to update the bike when I'm done.

It's 1:30pm as I post this.  I know I'm probably going to get nagged for firmware updates every time I look at a device for the rest of the day.  Will it be another IOS update?  There are 6 iPhones and 5 iPads in this house.  Maybe a firmware update for the wifi mesh (just checked, looks ok today)?  Maybe the smart Christmas lights will nag for an update if I change the pattern this evening.  It's relentless.

Jay Bhattacharya,"**If you line up all the wicked, unqualified, strange, and misshapen beings who will guide Trump’s administration into the stormy seas of fascism, not a single one can be linked to the incalculable measures of suffering that Jay Bhattacharya shepherded into history.**

If I have to pick only one from the list of nepotistic freaks, ghouls, B-list celebs, lost souls, Hitlerian zealots, and bunglers that will comprise U.S. President Donald Trump’s inner circle of appointees, satellite charlatans, and court jesters, I am going to go with the one with the highest body count. There are plenty of zombies in Trump’s starting lineup that would give you goosebumps—people who would cause you to choke on a sip of coffee and double check the pistol under your suit jacket if you met them in a diner to talk about internment camps and environmental deregulation. Picking the most terrible of these dregs is no easy task.

We have a serial pet murderer, a dumpy bald version of Reinhard Heydrich, and a bevy of cheerleaders for ecocide. Among Trump’s cabinet picks there is a guy with a fetish for bear meat and whale carcasses and a viable plan to bring back smallpox and polio, but it takes more than a nostalgic and wistful longing for diseases of long ago to excite me. There is a certain irony to choose the most upright, clean-cut, impressively credentialed, and soft spoken of this hall of Hell hounds to be my best of the worst. Few things inspire cold sweat beads of fear like a murderer masquerading as a nice guy. Think of Ted Bundy as a Trump appointee.

I have to select Jay Bhattacharya (Trump’s nominee to take over Francis Collins’ former niche as director of The National Institutes of Health) as my absolute favorite monster from among the whole entourage of moral mutants and groveling sycophants. Bhattacharya would not raise your suspicions if he knocked on your door to deliver pamphlets—I would happily take a copy of *The Watchtower* and *Awake* from this reassuring man. He would bring a glow of satisfaction to most parents if their daughter brought him home. Hell, he even has ardent fans on the so-called left—the Tucker Carlson fan club comprised of [Glenn Greenwald](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/glenn-greenwald), Jimmy Dore, and Matt Taibbi. ***You can toss Russell Brand in there too.***

1pu5em0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unOrdinary/comments/1pu5em0/remis_a_total_hypocrite_well_not_really/,Remi's a total hypocrite! Well... Not really.,"There's an argument that Remi was hypocritical for making John earn the trust of the safehouse members after his rampage. I've prepared counters for every point along the path and I figured I'd open it for general discussion. This isn't an attack, it's a debate and I don't intend it to be considered aggressive at all! Please engage with fun and tact.

It tends to go like this.

""Why didn't she reprimand her friends for hurting John""

They had already changed, so it wasn't necessary. The comic is about forgiveness. After John called Sera during his hiatus, she also didn't reprimand him. Neither did William once he understood the scope of the situation. Remi's friends had changed, accountability is about action, so a reprimand wouldn't make a difference. 

""Then why did she reprimand John""

Chapter 237, other people felt unsafe around him, so he had to prove he was different if he wanted to involve himself in spaces with his previous victims. This obviously didn't apply to the others, as nobody reported feelings of unease around them. Hypocrisy is when your behavior and beliefs don't align in the same context. This wasn't the same context. Her behavior adjusted to accommodate the difference in impact. Considering the impact on others is the opposite of hypocritical. 

""If feelings of unsafety are the problem, that same situation applied to that one midtier who was in there with a person that had been her victim who felt unsafe, why was that different?""

It wasn't. Remi didn't kick her out and she didn't kick John out. If ""different"" refers to a reprimand, Remi argued that the mid-tier's presence there was obviously to avoid conflict, and thus, it wouldn't make logical sense for her to seek out conflict if she's trying to avoid it 

""Why didn't that same argument work to defend John?""

Because John had previously entered the safe house with ill intent (more than once) and the students felt more unsafe with him & didn't understand why he entered it, that made them afraid. She asked John to integrate to accommodate their fear, which is hardly a reprimand to begin with. That wasn't necessary with the mid tier & obviously wasn't the case for Remi's friends. Asking John to integrate wasn't hypocritical because it doesn't contradict any of her previous actions which were in a different context.



Following this, you might say

""They only changed because they were being victims of violence""

Yes, but that doesn't matter. That's an unhealthy but in this case effect form of cognitive behavioral therapy. John ALSO only changed once he was victimized after NB. John woke them up and they changed. 

""So then they're selfishly trying to protect themselves""

Yes, at first. But it quickly melded with the lessons learned from their vigilante efforts and made them realize they needed to protect others and spread empathy and security. It doesn't matter where their intent began, it ended in a healthy place.

& A more specifically addressed argument: 

""Rei called out Kuyo but Remi didn't reprimand her friends""

Rei called out active and present abuse as it occured. Remi was previously ignorant to the abuse. When she no longer was, the abuse was not occuring and did not require a call-out. You can see this consistency when she *does* call out Arlo for humiliation the girl at the boba shop over spilled coffee.

""So she was ignorant? Doesn't that make her just as complicit?""

Yes. That's not hypocrisy though. That's *change*
Hypocrisy is when your present actions and values don't align. Not when your present actions and past actions don't align. If I said ""eating mangos is evil"" and you said ""you ate mangos in 2019"" that's not hypocrisy, clearly I learned the truth behind the sinister reality of mango consumption in the last 7 years. 


After this, the argument devolved into ""well you're just lying about what happened in the book"" which is obviously pretty untrue. Ideally *everyone here has read the comic* so you all know that pretty much everything I said here is objectively true. The closest thing I came to ""interpretation over literal text"" is saying that reprimands aren't necessary after the behavior has changed, but that's just common sense. If you called me out for eating mangos 7 years ago when I don't eat mangos anymore, that's just wasted breath for a non-issue. 


This is the argument as it goes literally *everytime* I see it.

I'm open to any arguments that aren't covered here. ",9,1766524716.0,unOrdinary,18,0.91,False

The part I always enjoyed the most was not menu engineering or vendor calls or even dialing in shots, though I like to think I got pretty good at them. The part I enjoyed most was designing the spaces and then actually building them out. I liked the problem solving. I liked translating workflow into floor plans. I liked coordinating trades and watching an idea turn into a physical space people actually use.

A few years ago I started a design build company focused specifically on restaurants and coffee shops. Mostly small to mid sized operators. Lots of first time owners. Some multi unit folks who are tired of explaining why a three compartment sink location actually matters.

I am not here to pitch services. I am here because my roaster asked me to put together a package or document that they can share with their wholesale clients when those clients ask for builder recommendations. I want it to actually be useful and not feel like a glossy sales brochure.

Before I go too far down that road I wanted to ask this sub **what would actually be helpful to you if you were on the receiving end of something like this.**

I will share what I am thinking of including and I would genuinely appreciate feedback additions or pushback. Comments, concerns, or cries of outrage.

* *Background -* I am thinking a short explanation of my background. Engineer turned operator turned builder. Not a resume dump. Just enough to explain why I understand both sides of the counter. As an owner you know how frustrating it is to work with someone who technically knows construction but does not understand service flow or health department realities. \*blah blah blah\* The goal here is to establish that I have lived through permitting delays, equipment lead times, and opening week chaos from the owner side and the builder side.
* *Portfolio -* A few of my own builds as case studies. I am thinking before and after with a short explanation of the problem and the solution. For example a shop where the original space had a weird column right where the bar wanted to be and how we reworked the line to keep bar flow clean. Or a tiny footprint where storage was the biggest constraint and how millwork decisions made or broke the operation.
* *High Level Pricing -* I want to be honest about budgets and timelines at a high level. Not exact numbers but ranges and what drove them. I remember how useless it was as an early owner to see a beautiful space with zero context and hear numbers from GCs without getting into any details. Maybe a budget framework and an explanation of how costs typically break down in a coffee shop or small restaurant build. Rough percentages for demo/MEP/millwork/equipment/finishes. Where people tend to underestimate costs. Where there is flexibility and where there really is not. For example underestimating electrical upgrades or overinvesting in decorative finishes before the core infrastructure is solid. Again speaking from painful personal experience.
* *Realistic Timelines and Possible Roadblocks -* I am thinking a clear step by step explanation in plain language. Site evaluation. Concept and layout. Health department and building department coordination. Construction. Inspections. Punch list. Opening support. I want to call out common friction points. Landlords dragging their feet. Equipment taking longer than expected. Inspectors finding something no one anticipated. Not to scare people but to normalize the reality. I wish someone had walked me through some of those things when I was younger.
* *Roles/Responsibilities* \- Who does what. What the owner is responsible for. What my team handles. If you bring your own design professional, what they're responsible for. I cannot tell you how many arguments I have seen that come down to assumptions that were never explicitly stated. Who pulls permits. Who coordinates utility upgrades. Who installs owner furnished equipment. This section would be boring but I feel like more info is better than less.
* *References -* Instead of a hard call to action I am thinking something like if you want to talk to past clients or walk a finished space here are a few options. Or even encouraging people to talk to other owners who have gone through builds whether with me or not. The goal would be to inspire trust, and really not a hard sell here. I'm pretty confident that once a client talks to me they would trust me over any other GC in our market.

If you were getting ready for a new build and asked your coffee roaster (or potentially other vendor) for a recommendation, what would you actually read? What would you find useful?

1pu5cgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1pu5cgw/got_my_period_back/,Got my period back✨,"Hey girls,

Just got my period back after almost 2 years!

***Why I lost my period***

•	I started running after work for stress relief and emotional control, which turned into obsessive running and competing with myself each time I ran.

•	I always ate everything and LOVED the way I looked! Believe me, a day without something sweet was not a good or regular day <3 But after a few months since I started running, I wasn’t really satisfied with the way I looked anymore, so I went on a diet.

•	I weighed 62 kg when I started dieting (and I am 175 cm tall). My weight dropped to 55 kg in 2–3 months, which was 10% of my weight. That caused my period loss.

•	At one point, I didn’t eat carbs except oats and corn flour. Only protein. Oil/fat free. Sugar free. Low calorie. At one point, I was eating only 800 calories a day and lived on apples and black coffee. This is sick, girls. It is not good and it will never get your period back. Thank God it didn’t last long, but it made serious consequences. And I was recovering for a long time.

***What got my period back***

•	Very **important**: I gained my old weight back, and I was very careful not to go below it. I was patient and waited 3 months at that weight. It returned.

•	Eating everything, and above 3500 calories on weekends/traveling. I stopped counting when I started recovery, but I was regularly eating probably between 2000 and 3000 a day.

(I ate at the beginning of recovery around 1500–1800; it didn’t get me anywhere.)

•	Switched HIIT training and running to Pilates, dance, and walking.

•	The month before my period came back, I ate within the first hour of waking up and then every 3 hours.

3 big meals and 2 snack meals.

•	Did yoga and meditation.

•	Therapy and meditation to gain my confidence back.

***Message for you***

*Your body and brain want you to be back to your older self — who you were before losing your period. Whether it was an ED, lots of training, or stress that caused your period to disappear, try finding who you were before that. Believe me, it’s possible. Enjoy life, enjoy food. Life is short. Enjoy restaurants with friends, family, and the people you love. Have a muffin with coffee. Have dates with yourself. Eat a pastry and take a walk around a park or the city. Don’t make your loved ones worry about you, and don’t bother them with questions about your body. Take everything your loved ones offer you with a “thank you” and a smile, and tell them it is “amazing.” Because they don’t love you for how you look, but for who you are.*

*Just think about it — would you stop loving your friend or sister just because they don’t look like a branch or don’t have a flat belly and a lot of muscles? Would you tell them all the things you are telling yourself? I think not! Be kind and loving to yourself. Thank God for guiding you through your path in life, and be patient.*",7,1766524558.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

I didn’t know until she gave me the address today. As she was giving me the bag a cop car passed by asking what I bought from her. I was like they’re just cheesecake cups and he let me go. I understand he’s just doing his job especially in a questionable area.

Initially I was supposed to meet her at her work (coffee shop) to pick them up but she “forgot” she was off today and told me I could either have it delivered (for a fee) or pick it up at her place. Then this morning she messages me saying,”So I was in the store last night and I was actually wondering today that i actually made no profit due to me giving you the price from 2 years ago and didn’t realize how much prices have gone up, in that case I will be charging an extra fee, I am so sorry I didn’t see how much everything went up!!”.

🤦🏽‍♀️

I had already paid the deposit and she already went through the trouble of making them. It sucks because I was like okay she’s in college I don’t mind supporting a side hustle.

Growing up, my family always opened presents on Christmas morning. It was the whole thing. Waking up early, pajamas, coffee, kids running to the tree. It’s one of those traditions that just feels really core to me.

My husband’s family, on the other hand, opens all their presents on Christmas Eve. That’s what he grew up with and what his parents still expect. Now that we have kids, this difference is suddenly a lot louder than it used to be.

Every year it turns into this awkward tension about when we’re supposed to do what, whose tradition takes priority, and how to make everyone happy without feeling like we’re giving something up. I don’t want to be dramatic about it, but it genuinely makes me sad to think about losing that Christmas morning feeling. At the same time, I don’t want my husband to feel like his family’s way doesn’t matter.

Has anyone else dealt with clashing holiday traditions once kids entered the picture? How did you navigate it without it turning into resentment on either side?",26,1766524436.0,Mommit,56,0.91,False

I've had a sage/brevile barista express impress for nearly a year and a half. 

I still haven't had a good espresso from it. I go through multi week long phases of trying to get one and give up because I use so many beans and just go back to tolerating black coffee. 

I have watched hundreds of hours of videos, gone to the espresso discord for support.

I feel like I've tried everything when it comes to dialing in, I'm getting perfect looking espresso, in the desired times, no channeling, changing temperatures, grind size, dose, yield, worked my way through so many different guides and methods of dialing in. 

I've tried different beans Both dark roast and medium roast incase that's the issue. I've used older beans. I usually buy my beans as fresh as they can be and rest for 10 or so days before use. I've used beans that are 2 days fresh and ive used them for the following week to see the change between freshness each day. 

I've gone from using the machines built in tamp to buying a tamp and tamping manually, I'm weighing my dose before and after grinding. I'm using a wdt to distribute I've also tried using a rotating distributor.

Yet still through all of the above I can't get a balanced espresso.

I'm genuinely starting to think my machine is the problem because surely through all this I should have at least got a good shot by accident at some point.

I love espresso, and I've liked every espresso I've ever purchased regardless of if it's from the shittest cafes and chains or from a ""good"" cafe so I know it's not just that I don't actually like it. 

My partners parents have a bean to cup machine that they throw undated 1kg bags of beans in and even they get good espresso so it's almost insulting that I can't get a half good one with nearly £1k worth of machine and accessories.

My (20sF) maternal aunt ""Anne"" (60sF) can be a lot to deal with and our entire family thinks so. Anne acts like a 16 year old mean girl trapped in a 60 year old's body. She also thinks that she's spiritually enlightened, wants everyone to know it, and calls herself a 'life coach'. Anne is very confrontational and doesn't get along with a lot of people.  

I have always had a weird, strained, somewhat love hate relationship with my aunt. As odd as it sounds, she has always been a bully towards me, frequently enough that other family members have commented on it. 

Luckily, she lives on the west coast, while the rest of our family is on the east coast so we only see once or twice a year. 

Anne is currently visiting for the holidays. Many of my family members have been staying at my maternal grandmother's house, including me and Anne. 

Anne and I were running Christmas errands this past Saturday and were in a time crunch because we needed to pick up my grandmother from her hair appointment. We had about 45 minutes to finish shopping at Target and pick up my grandma. 

Anne insisted on making an additional unplanned stop to Whole Foods while I finished checking out at Target because as she put it ""none of the coffee Target sold was good enough for her"". Whole Foods and Target are three stores down from each other in this shopping center. Anne, for whatever reason, decided to drive from one side of the shopping center to the other even though it's literally a 2 minute walk. 

I waited 10 minutes in line to check out at Target. I then waited 10 minutes outside of Target for Anne. My phone died before we got to Target (I had told Anne this), so I had no way of getting in contact with her. We were running late, so I decided to walk over to Whole Foods to see if Anne was stuck on a long line or something. She was nowhere to be seen, so I decided to walk back to Target and wait for her there. 

A few minutes after I got back outside Target, Anne pulled up in the car and started screaming at me to get in the car. She was yelling at me that it was my fault we were running late/that my grandmother is waiting for us. 

I yelled back that 20 minutes had passed since I had seen her and that I went to look for her. 

Anne told me that she didn't care and that I should have waited outside Target for her no matter how long it took and that it was just my 'ADHD' impatience problems. 

Anne kept on screaming at me that I'm disregulating even though she was the one who started and kept screaming at me. 

My aunt Anne proceeded to call me a cunt, tell me I have no friends, tell me that she likes her other nieces better than me, and admit that she set up a girls dinner on my birthday for all the women in my extended family so that I wouldn't be able to go. 

When I got back to my grandmother's house, I told my older brother Matt what Anne said to me and he got into a fight with her. Anne told Matt that no one else in our extended family likes us and that she is the reason why we're invited to anything (lol ok). 

I have been avoiding her the past few days. 

Yesterday, Matt said something to her again and she screamed a lot of shit about me so loud everyone in the house could hear. 

After calming down, Anne came up to me, my mom, and brothers and said that we needed a ""family healing"", before proceeding to shit talk me some more. I walked out of the room, but my mom and brothers stayed and defended me against her. 

A few weeks ago, Anne had bullied my maternal uncle (my mom and Anne's brother) into hosting Christmas Day in the city even though he really didn't want to. 

I'm not going to Christmas anymore because of Anne's behavior. I don't want to be around her and I don't think the relationship is even worth fixing at this point.

My mom and brothers also aren't going to Christmas because I'm not going. In case anyone is wondering, my mom is really upset with Anne and has my back. We told my maternal uncle we weren't going because my brothers have to work the next day (my uncle wasn't involved and doesn't know what happened). 

My grandma is devastated that we're not going and thinks I should just suck it up, go, and avoid Anne. 

I'm not saying I'll never go to family Christmas again, this situation is just so fresh and I don't want to deal with Anne in the near future. 

Am I going nuclear and overreacting by not going to Christmas?

I know this all sounds like long winded, petty high school style bullshit. I am also aware how stupid the Target/Whole Foods situation was. This is how Anne acts. I just wanted to provide the context and timeline of events before anyone asked about the events leading up to my aunt calling me a cunt. 

**TL;DR:** My maternal aunt Anne called me a cunt, told me I have no friends, told me that she likes her other nieces better than me, and admitted that she set up a girls dinner on my birthday for all the women in my extended family so that I wouldn't be able to go. 

My mom, brothers and I are now not going to Christmas at my maternal uncle (my mom and Anne's brother)'s house because we don't want to see Anne. My grandma is devastated and thinks I should just suck it up, go to Christmas, and avoid Anne.

Light chattering filled the room as usual. It was much more lively in the estate these days... Market didn't mind but it sure did bother her at times when they'd all get too chaotic for her liking.

""Hey, Market?""

Snapping out of her thoughts, Market looked up at Doi. He was still as serene as ever. She liked that about him, how he was always so polished and clean. It made her wonder if he could ever look messy.

""Compassionate is being ... Hysterical again.. they keep on talking about Azazel.""

Doi murmured to Market, like someone was listening to their conversation. Market looked up at Doi's veil. The silky piece of cloth obstructing the view of his face. She blinked, staring at Doi.

""Huh?.. who's Compassionate?""

""...""

Doi sighed, getting up and rubbing his arms. Market stared at him. Waiting for an answer she'll probably never get.

""Forget it..""

Doi muttered, an exhausted sigh leaving him. Market felt a little guilty for being so forgetful. A lot has been on her mind, and she didn't wanna strain any relationships with her friends because of everything that has happened.

A sudden pang of pain jolted through Market's head. Like being hit in the head with a metal pole. She recoiled, her eyes blurring as a ringing sensation filled her ears. She shook her head, trying to somehow shake the pain off. Her hands started to shake as sweat beads formed. What was hapening-

""MARKET!""

Doi shouted, looking annoyed. Market's head snapped up to him, getting disorientated and overwhelmed from the loud sound. Doi started to speak again but it sounded like muffled static against her ears. She just stared at him. Unable to make a coherent thought or say at least a huh.

""Are you even listening?..""

Market blinked. Staring at Doi like he was a creature from another realm. And Doi stared right back. She couldn't make out his features, but the concern from him was practically radiating off. Doi sighed, hesitantly patting her shoulder.

""It's fine.. you should get some rest, I'll handle the rest from here.""

Market blinked before nodding slowly. Standing up from the couch, she stumbled for a second before regaining her footing. Her wings shifted behind her, it felt weird. She knew she should be used to them by now, but still. It wasn't something she was used to. Shaking away her thoughts, she moved to go to her room.

୧‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿୨

Market sat down on the chair. Rubbing her eyes before looking over her desk. Her laptop, paperwork, empty coffee cups, and more paperwork sprawled all over the ground. Market groaned, she's gonna have to clean that up soon.

""Shame.""

Market froze, immediately getting up and backing away as she stared at ""Valerie"". Was it Valerie? Or was it just another dream?

""Shameful. You're very shameful.. you know, █████!""

Market backed up, her eyes widening. That sudden headache coming back, more stronger, more painful.

""What's wrong?... Aren't you happy to see your BEST friend?""

Her eyes began blurring as tears began pouring. Was it her tears or sweat? Maybe both.

""You're pathetic. You know?""

Her ears began ringing again, everything becoming deafening except the beat of her own heart and ""Valerie's"" words.

""You wanna prove that you're soo independent- that you're strong! But let's face it, you're as weak as all those people.""

Her knees buckled, her breathing growing heavier. She wanted to scream, to yell at ""Valerie"" to leave her alone- but nothing came out.

""I almost pity you! But why would anyone pity such a murderer like you?""

She felt sick. Her stomach churning as her ears began to ring more- and that awful stench creeping into her nose again. That horrid smell of chemicals burning and bodies being incinerated.

""You could've saved HER. But you watched her get burned alive- tell me, was it satisfying? Did it bring you PLEASURE?""

Market began to shake even more. Her knees finally giving way as she backed up. Trying to escape her— trying to escape the reality of that day.

""It- I didn't do anything -""

""Ohh you didn't do anything? Well, what DID you do? Nothing! You WATCHED your peers die, you watched THEM die. It's all your fault.""

Market began sobbing, her hands coming up to her ears to block out ""Valerie's"" words. Her knees pressing against her chest as she murmured for her to stop.

""You think just because you're not there anymore excuses your past? No, you're dripping with sin. It should've been YOU who died that day.""

Market buried her face in her knees. Her hands desperately clawing at her ears. Everything felt too real. Was it really her fault? Yes. It was. It was all her fault.

Market continued to sob, murmuring to ""Valerie"" to stop. But she was already gone. Just like ████████, just like that building, just like them, just like HER.

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

and i went to sleep at 4 am both on well friday to saturday and 4.30 am on satuday to sunday

and this is the 2nd week of me feeling this way like off days are there but usually not 2 weeks long

and sorry if this is the wrong place its the first that came to mind

monday

i went again today from 9-12 and just got home and idk there is a girl there we have a decent click nothing special and we can laugh together play pool etc

1pu4w1u,https://i.redd.it/n6p9r992p09g1.jpeg,I can’t focus on ANYTHING because of my sensory sensitivities! Help!,"TW: mention of suicide attempt. No details. 

Hey everyone! I’m really struggling out here. I’m self-diagnosed and unofficially diagnosed by my doctor, idk if that matters. 

My parents declined to have me diagnosed as a teen because they didn’t want a daughter with disabilities so instead they labeled me (and consequently I developed) Borderline, now in remission. I’ve survived an attempt on my life, which occurred because I just have no idea why I even exist if I can’t function in society (I CAN but it’s a miserable experience. I’m thankful I can at least blend in socially).

I’m now 33 and have never been able to hold a stable job without significant support. The longest I’ve held a job is 3 years. I’m no longer working except for as an artist and independent designer…but even that is so hard for me! I’ve only made three oil paintings this year. Focusing is exhausting. Every single noise — even electricity buzzing or my husband breathing — makes me want to scream! I can’t will myself to do much of anything on my own. I can’t cook for myself because of the food textures and the sounds and the smells. 

I am tired all of the time. I have chronic migraine and endometriosis which always comes back after surgeries. I’m chronically dehydrated because I hate drinking water. I’m on so many antidepressants and anti anxiety medications that I’m not even sure I need anymore. Coffee puts me to sleep! Weed helps a bit but only sometimes. It’s hit or miss. 

I’m living in the U.S. so getting a proper diagnosis is next to impossible without good insurance. I feel like a husk rather than a person. I literally had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated that I had an obstructed bowel. I’m estranged from my whole family because they refuse to see me for who I am. They think I’m lying. They think I’m lazy. They think I’m broken or there’s just something wrong with me. 

My husband just lost his job last week and I don’t have my green card yet so I can’t legally work. I’m at my wits end. I’m either burnt out or under-stimulated all the time. I have EDS too, so I’m in constant pain. Cardio is essentially a no-go, so I can’t do any of the athletic activities I used to love (like dance). I just don’t know what to do! I don’t want to spend the rest of my life miserable. 

As an aside, I’m realizing that I basically can’t have kids because it would mean subjecting them to all the genetic bullshit that I suffer from. I could never put any life through what I’ve been through. My heart is broken. I feel like there’s no point of continuing on. 

I know I tagged this as a rant but I’m also seeking advice and solidarity. Anything that anyone here does or uses — tools, apps, programs, thought exercises or journal prompts — I’ll try ANYTHING to get a semblance of a life back.

**$DKNG**: **~~+155~~** **+179**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.79U

League: Utah Mammoth vs Colorado Avalanches + Calgary Flames vs Edmonton Oilers (8:10PM CST on ESPN+)

**Recap**: It was a frustrating 1st half to say the least! 1 Target in the 1st half and he was wide open in the endzone and he threw it Kittle. I was going to say that when I'm on Kittle, Jauan scores and when I'm Jauan, Kittle scores, but that was not the case because Jauan Jennings caught TD pass on the 1st score of the 2nd half! So didn't get the prediction right, but I still got the pick right! Brock Purdy out here throwing present for everyone on his team, he threw 5 passing TDs, George Kittle, DeMarcus Robinson, CMC, and Jauan Jennings! Everyone ate! I would even argue that Jake Tonges got one too (it was ruled no catch without further review). Let's go that's 3 straight POTD dubs!

**Matchup:** I HATE THE ASSOCIATION WIT A PASSION! And it hates me! **I had 5 lays ALL of 'em loss by a single leg (3 of them by Fade Cunningham in all different props, 20+ Points, 30 PAR and 35 PAR)! He fouled out early in the 4th quarter (I only needed just 1 more point or 1 more assist or 1 more rebound, but I got neither) and it looked very unnecessary for what he did!** He looked like he just wanted to get outta that game. I got a couple straight bets, but I honestly don't feel confident because NBA has really been a hate-hate relationship for me. If one of those lays came thru I prolly would be featuring a NBA wager for today's POTD, but FUCK the association right now, so I'm going Hot Key!

I'm doing a SGPx (Same-Game-Parlay-X) first time for today's POTD. I kno what you're thinking. A damn parlay? And it's prolly going to lose by 1-leg. **You might be right, but I just can't find any value today. I was considering doing my best bets today, but it's in the NBA and it will prolly lose anyway because NBA absolutely hates me!**

Straights are always king and parlays (or any type of parlays) for suckers, but if you're degen like myself, I think you gotta throw a parlay once in a while. Betting in general should be for fun, so few can do this for a living, only the elite sharps can and that's okay. There's nothing wrong wit being a casual or average joe bettor, we all kno that the books are making a killing off us, we just want to have some action in the games. Best way to have fun is to throw some money on a parlay, in this particular case a SGPx!

I do think this lay smacks tho. It's a 4-legged SGPx, 2-legs in the Mammoth/Avs game and 2-legs in the Flames/Oilers games. For the Mammoth/Avs game, it's Avs ML and Nathan MacKinnon 1+ Point. For the Flames/Oilers game, it's Oilers ML and Connor McDavid 1+ Point. I have no doubt in my mind that both McDavid and MacKinnon will record a Point in each of their respective game. I also strongly believe that Avs win this game at home, the 1-leg that gives me concern is Oilers ML. They should beat the Flames at home, but Idk they had a better start to this season than last season, but their winning effort just hasn't been dominant as it was in the past. So if you don't like what you see then I would recommend hedging on the Flames ML. You can get a great price on them as the underdog anyway or if Oilers take the lead, then you can get even a greater price and wouldn't have to hedge much. Or you can just leave off the Oilers ML, that's what I usually do and just player props like Leon Draisaitl 1+ Point or Ast or Connor McDavid props. Up to you. Both Connor and Nathan have the most points thus far this season. Nathan is on a 8-game streak of recording 1+ Point and Connor is on a 10-game streak of recording 1+ Point. Both are on a tear and I expect nothing less in their respective matchups.

**The Play & Prediction :**  Using my 20% daily boost from DK on this POTD from +155 to +179. 1U on 4-legged SGPx of Mammoth/Avs + Flames/Oilers game. You can pick and choose which you want to tail. Both McDavid and MacKinnon scores the game winning/go-ahead goals of their respective game.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1pu4tuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pu4tuk/ive_been_driving_rigs_for_15_years_last_month_i/,"I’ve been driving rigs for 15 years. Last month, I pulled into the wrong gas station, and I’m lucky to be alive.","Alright, I don't know where else to put this. I tried to file a report, and the look I got from the officer was one step away from asking me to take a breathalyzer. My company dispatcher thinks I was hallucinating from exhaustion. But I know what I saw. I know what almost happened. I've been driving rigs for fifteen years, and I've seen some strange things on the asphalt sea, but nothing… nothing like this. So I’m putting it here. A warning. For any of you guys running the long haul, or even just a family on a road trip, burning the midnight oil to make it to grandma’s by morning. If you see this place, you push that pedal to the floor and you don't look back. You run on fumes if you have to. It's better than the alternative.

It happened about three weeks ago. I was on a cross-country run, hauling a load of non-perishables. The kind of gig that's more about endurance than anything else. Just you, the hum of the Cummins diesel, and the endless ribbon of blacktop unwinding in your high beams. The section of highway I was on is notoriously empty. It's a dead zone. No radio signal worth a damn, no cell service for a hundred miles in either direction. It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're the last person on Earth, a tiny capsule of light and noise moving through an infinite, silent void.

I'm usually pretty good with my fuel management. It's second nature after this long. But I'd been pushing it, trying to make up time I lost at the weigh station. The needle on the diesel gauge was kissing 'E' with a little too much affection. The low fuel light had been blinking patiently for the last twenty miles, a tiny orange beacon of my own stupidity. I started doing the math, calculating mileage, and a cold sweat started to prickle my neck. Getting stranded out here wasn't just an inconvenience; it was dangerous.

Just as a genuine knot of panic began to tighten in my stomach, I saw it. Up ahead, a faint, sickly yellow glow, bleeding into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't much, just a single light, but it was enough. As I got closer, the shape resolved itself. A small, single-story building with a low, flat roof and a short awning over a pair of fuel pumps. The sign was old, the kind with the plastic letters you can change by hand. A few letters were missing, so it read something like ""_AS & _AT."" The light I’d seen was coming from a single, flickering fluorescent bulb under the awning, which cast long, dancing shadows and made the whole place look like it was underwater.

Everything about it screamed ‘keep driving.’ The paint was peeling off the walls in long strips, like sunburnt skin. The pumps looked ancient, the kind with the rotating numbers instead of a digital display. The whole lot was cracked asphalt and weeds. But my gauge was now defiantly sitting on empty, and beggars can't be choosers. With a sigh that felt like it came from my boots, I geared down, the air brakes hissing in protest, and swung the big rig into the lot. The trailer tires crunched over loose gravel. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint, frantic chirping of crickets.

I climbed down from the cab, my legs stiff. The air was cool and smelled of dust and distant rain. Through the grimy plate-glass window of the station, I could see one person, a small figure standing behind a counter.

The bell above the door let out a weak, tinny jingle as I pushed it open. The inside smelled of stale coffee, dust, and something else… something vaguely metallic and sweet, like old pennies. The shelves were mostly bare. A few dusty cans of off-brand beans, a rack of sun-bleached chips, a cooler that hummed loudly but seemed to contain nothing but shadows. The only person there was an old woman.

She was tiny, almost bird-like, with a cloud of thin, white hair and a face that was a roadmap of wrinkles. She wore a faded floral-print dress and a grey cardigan pulled tight around her shoulders, even though it wasn't cold inside. The moment I stepped in, her head snapped up, and a wave of what I can only describe as profound relief washed over her features.

""Oh, thank heavens,"" she said, her voice thin and raspy, like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She put a trembling hand to her chest. ""You gave me a start, but I'm so glad to see you. I get so nervous out here all by myself at night.""

I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring nod. ""No problem, ma'am. Just need to fill up the tanks.""

""Of course, of course,"" she said, her eyes, which were surprisingly sharp and clear in her wrinkled face, darting to the window and back to me. ""It's just… the silence, you know? It gets so loud out here when you're all alone.""

I understood that. I really did. The loneliness of the road is a character all its own. ""I hear you,"" I said, pulling out my company card. ""It's a long way between towns on this stretch.""

""Isn't it just,"" she breathed, her eyes fixed on me. ""A long, long way. You headed east or west, dear?""

The question was normal enough. Gas station small talk. But the intensity in her gaze was a little off. ""East,"" I said. ""Got a load for the coast.""

""The coast,"" she repeated, almost dreamily. ""That's a good long drive. A real long drive. You must get awfully tired.""

""Part of the job,"" I shrugged. I tapped the card on the counter. ""Can I prepay for, say, two hundred on pump one?""

She didn't move to take the card. She just kept looking at me, her head tilted slightly. ""Will you be stopping again soon? Before you get to the city?""

Okay, this was getting weird. ""Probably not. Just want to get as many miles in as I can before sun-up.""

""So no one's really… expecting you?"" she asked, her voice dropping a little. ""No one's waiting for you at a motel or anything like that? You're just… out here. On your own.""

The way she said ‘on your own’ sent a little shiver down my spine. It was a statement. An observation. I felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to lie, to tell her my wife was waiting on the phone, that my dispatcher was tracking my every move. But the words caught in my throat. I just wanted to get my fuel and go.

""That's right,"" I said, my voice a little tighter than I intended. ""Just me and the road. The pump, ma'am?""

She finally blinked, a slow, deliberate motion, and a thin smile stretched her lips. ""Of course, dear. My apologies. My mind wanders."" She took the card and ran it through the ancient machine, her gnarled fingers moving with a slow, deliberate pace.

As the machine was processing, the tinny bell above the door jingled again. I turned. A man had entered. He was tall and lean, with the kind of weathered, leathery skin you get from a life spent outdoors. He wore a dirty flannel shirt and worn-out jeans. He didn't look at me, just let his eyes roam over the empty shelves, a strange, hungry look on his face. He walked with a slight limp, his boots scuffing quietly on the linoleum floor.

He ambled up to the counter, standing a few feet away from me, and leaned in towards the old woman. He still didn't acknowledge my presence. It was like I was a piece of furniture.

""Anything come in?"" he asked, his voice a low, gravelly rumble.

The old woman's smile tightened. She handed me my card back, but her eyes were on him. ""Not yet,"" she said, her voice now carrying a different tone. It was businesslike. Colder. ""Still waiting.""

The man grunted, sniffing the air. ""I'm getting hungry,"" he said, and turned his head and his eyes, dark and flat as river stones, flickered over me for a fraction of a second. They were completely devoid of emotion.

Then he looked back at the woman. ""Any fresh meat?""

My blood went cold. The phrase hung in the dusty air, thick and greasy. It had to be a joke. Some kind of local slang. Maybe they sold deer jerky, or they were hunters. That had to be it. My tired brain was making connections that weren't there.

The old woman didn't miss a beat. She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod in my direction. My back was mostly to her, but I saw it in the reflection on the grimy cooler door.

""There's fresh meat on the way,"" she said, her voice a low murmur. ""Just be patient.""

The man grunted again, a sound of satisfaction this time, and turned and walked out. The bell jingled his departure. I stood there for a second, my heart hammering against my ribs. 'Fresh meat on the way.' A trucker. Headed east. No one expecting him. Alone.

""Your pump is all set, dear,"" the old woman said, her voice back to that frail, sweet tone. It was like she’d flipped a switch.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. ""Thanks,"" I mumbled, turning and pushing the door open so hard the bell clanked against the glass.

The night air felt good, but it didn't wash away the sudden, slimy feeling of dread that had coated my skin. I tried to shake it off. I was tired. Overreacting. They were just weird locals with a weird sense of humor. I walked over to the pump, unscrewed the caps on my tanks, and grabbed the heavy diesel nozzle.

As I stood there, the pump chugging away, my eyes scanned the darkness. My rig was the only vehicle in the front lot. But my senses were on high alert now, and I was noticing things my tired brain had initially filtered out. I let my gaze drift past the station, to the dark, gravel area behind it.

And that's when I saw it.

Tucked away in the shadows, almost perfectly hidden from the road, was a pickup truck. It was an old model, beat to hell, with a mismatched fender and a dull, rusted paint job. Its lights were off. It was just sitting there, silent and waiting. As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I realized there was someone in the driver's seat, a silhouette against the slightly less black night sky.

A prickle of unease turned into a full-blown alarm bell in my head. Why park back there? Why with no lights?

Then, as I watched, another vehicle pulled in. It didn't come from the highway. It seemed to materialize from a dirt track that ran alongside the station. Another beat-up pickup, this one a dark blue, though it was hard to tell in the dim light. It coasted in just as silently as the first one, its engine a barely audible rumble before it was cut. It parked right next to the first one, also in the shadows, also with its lights off. Two men got out of that one, moving with a quiet purpose that was anything but casual. They didn't go into the station. They just leaned against their truck and waited, their faces obscured by the darkness.

I felt like I was watching a scene from a movie I didn't want to be in. The pieces started clicking into place with a horrifying, metallic certainty. 
The pump clicked off, the tank full. My hands were shaking as I hung up the nozzle and screwed the cap back on. My mind was racing. I had to get out of there. Now. I didn't even bother filling the second tank. To hell with the money. Every second I spent here felt like a lifetime borrowed on credit I didn't have.

I practically jogged back to my cab, my boots crunching loud in the terrible silence. I kept my eyes on the station, expecting the someone to come back out, or the guys from the pickups to start walking towards me. But nothing happened.

Just as my hand reached the handle of my truck door, the station door opened. It was the old woman. She was holding a steaming styrofoam cup.

""Oh, dear, you forgot this!"" she called out, her voice carrying that same frail, grandmotherly tone. But it sounded grotesque to me now, a mask.

She started walking towards me, one slow, shuffling step at a time. ""I made a fresh pot of coffee. You looked so tired, I thought you could use it. It's on the house. A little something to keep you awake on that long road.""

My entire body screamed NO. Every instinct, every primal, self-preserving fiber of my being wanted me to get in the cab, lock the door, and lay on the horn until my hand broke.

But I was frozen. If I refused, what then? Would they just drop the act? Would the men from the trucks come out of the shadows? The charade, however thin, felt like the only thing keeping me alive right now. Playing along might buy me a few precious seconds.

She reached me, her hand trembling as she held out the cup. Or was it trembling? Looking closer, her hand was steady as a rock. It was the cup that was vibrating from the sloshing of the hot liquid. Her eyes, those piercingly clear eyes, were locked on mine. They weren't kind. They were expectant.

""You take this,"" she insisted, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""It'll help you. You need to rest.""

I took the cup. Her skin was cold and dry as paper where her fingers brushed mine. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" I managed to choke out. The words felt like ash in my mouth.

""You're very welcome, dear,"" she said, that thin smile returning. ""Drive safe now.""

She turned and shuffled back to the station, disappearing inside. I didn't wait to watch the door close. I scrambled up into my cab, slammed the door, and hit the locks. My heart was a wild bird beating against my ribs. I jammed the key in the ignition and the diesel engine roared to life, shattering the night's silence. The coffee cup sat in my cup holder, radiating a sickening, artificial warmth. I didn't dare spill it. I didn't dare throw it out the window. I just left it there, a symbol of how close I'd come.

I put the truck in gear and pulled out of that godforsaken lot, my tires spitting gravel. I didn't look at the station in my side mirror. I looked at the mirror pointed towards the back of the station.

As I rolled onto the highway, two pairs of headlights flicked on in the darkness behind the building.

They pulled out after me, falling into formation about a quarter-mile back. They didn't speed up. They didn't flash their lights. They just followed. Two beat-up pickup trucks, the silent partners in this nightmare. My blood ran cold. This was it. The hunt was on.

My foot pressed the accelerator to the floor. The rig groaned, slowly picking up speed. 60. 70. 80. I was pushing it far beyond the safe limit, the trailer swaying slightly behind me. But every time I looked in the mirror, the two sets of headlights were still there, maintaining their distance, two pairs of predatory eyes in the black.

I grabbed my phone. Just as I suspected. No Service. I was completely and utterly alone.

The next few hours were the purest form of terror I have ever known. It wasn't a slasher-movie, jump-scare kind of fear. It was a slow, grinding, psychological horror. The road stretched on, an endless black void. There were no other cars. No exits. No signs of civilization. Just me, my roaring engine, and the two sets of lights behind me.

They were herding me. I knew it. They were patient. They knew this stretch of road. They knew there was nowhere for me to go. They were just waiting. Waiting for me to make a mistake. Waiting for my nerve to break. Or, if their original plan had worked, waiting for the drugs in the coffee to kick in and do the job for them. I glanced at the cup, still sitting there. I imagined myself getting drowsy, my eyelids feeling like lead, pulling over to the shoulder… I shook my head violently, forcing the image out.

My mind raced through scenarios. What did they want? The truck? The cargo? No. The man's words echoed in my head. ‘Fresh meat.’ It wasn't about my rig. It was about me.

I thought about slamming on the brakes, trying to get them to crash into my trailer. But they were keeping their distance, and what if I just jackknifed the rig? I'd be a sitting duck, trapped in a wreck. I thought about trying to call them on the CB, but what would I say? And what if they answered? The thought of hearing one of their voices crackle over the radio was somehow more terrifying than the silence.

So I just drove. I drove with my eyes glued to the road ahead and the mirror. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. My body was drenched in a cold sweat. Every shadow on the side of the road was a new threat, every bend a potential ambush. The hum of the engine was my only ally. As long as it was running, I was moving. As long as I was moving, I was alive.

The night seemed to stretch into eternity. Time lost all meaning. There was only the road, the engine, the fear, and the lights. They never wavered, never got closer, never fell further behind. They were a constant, terrifying presence. A promise of what was waiting for me if I stopped.

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, I saw it. A faint, almost imperceptible lightening of the sky on the eastern horizon. At first, I thought my tired eyes were playing tricks on me. But it grew, a line of pale grey, then a soft, bruised purple. Dawn.

I didn't let myself feel hope. It felt too much like a trap. But as the sun began to properly crest the horizon, painting the desolate landscape in shades of orange and pink, something happened.

I looked in my mirror. The headlights behind me were gone.

I scanned the road behind me, my heart in my throat. The two pickup trucks were still there, but they were falling back. Rapidly. As the first rays of direct sunlight spilled over the plains and hit my windshield, I looked in the mirror one last time. The two trucks were making a sharp, synchronized U-turn in the middle of the empty highway, and speeding off in the direction we'd come from.

They were gone.

Just like that. The sunlight had saved me. It was like they were creatures of the dark, unable or unwilling to operate in the light of day where they could be seen, identified.

I drove for another ten miles, my body shaking with adrenaline and relief, before I finally pulled over. I killed the engine and the silence that rushed in was beautiful. It was the silence of survival. I sat there for a long time, watching the sun climb higher in the sky, just breathing. My eyes fell on the styrofoam cup. With a convulsive, angry movement, I snatched it, rolled down the window, and hurled it out into the desert. I watched it tumble into a ditch, a tiny, harmless-looking piece of white trash that held a death sentence.

I finished my haul. I delivered my load. I did it on autopilot, the terror of that night replaying in a constant loop in my head. I looked like hell, and my boss told me to take a few days off. The first thing I did was go to the state police barracks for the county where the station was.

I sat in a sterile interrogation room and told my story to a weary-looking officer with a thick mustache. I told him everything. The station, the old woman, her questions, the man, the phrase 'fresh meat', the trucks, the coffee, the chase. He wrote it all down, but the look on his face was one of polite, professional disbelief.

""So,"" he said, tapping his pen on his notepad. ""You're saying this gas station, which isn't on any of our maps, by the way, is a front for some kind of… hunting party? And they chase truckers through the night?""

""I'm telling you what happened,"" I said, my voice tight. ""That coffee was drugged. They were going to kill me.""

""And you have this coffee?""

""I threw it out! I was terrified!""

He sighed. ""Look, sir. You truckers drive long hours. The mind can play tricks on you when you're fatigued.""

I insisted. I gave him the mile marker where I thought it was. I described the turnoff. I told him he had to check it out. To his credit, and probably just to shut me up, he agreed to humor me. He said he'd take a drive out there when he had a chance. I knew that meant never. So I pushed. I told him I'd ride with him. I'd show him the exact spot. After a long argument, he reluctantly agreed, probably thinking it was the fastest way to prove me crazy.

So the next day, I was in the passenger seat of his cruiser, driving back down that same dark stretch of highway, this time in the bright, unforgiving light of day. My stomach was in knots.

""It should be right up here,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Around this bend.""

We came around the bend, and there it was. The dirt turnoff. The cracked asphalt lot. The single-story building with the low, flat roof.

""See?"" I said, a wave of vindication washing over me. ""I told you.""

The officer didn't say anything. He just pulled the cruiser into the lot and put it in park. We both got out.

The building was there. But it wasn't a gas station.

It was a derelict. A shell. The windows were boarded up from the inside, thick with cobwebs and grime. The door was hanging off one hinge, held shut by a rusty padlock. The sign that had read ""_AS & _AT"" was just a rusted metal frame, the plastic long gone. The pumps were there, but they were skeletal remains, their hoses rotted away, their metal casings pitted with rust and time. I walked over and looked at the dial. It was rusted solid. These things hadn't pumped a gallon of fuel in thirty years.

""This is it?"" the officer asked, his voice flat.

I walked over to the building and peered through a crack in the boarded-up window. I expected to see the dusty shelves, the counter, the cooler.

There was nothing.

The inside was completely, totally empty. It was a single, hollow room. Bare floorboards, crumbling drywall. No counter. No shelves. No wiring for a cooler. There was a thick layer of dust on the floor that was completely undisturbed. No footprints. No sign that anyone had been inside for decades.

It was a ghost. An empty stage.

We checked the gravel lot behind the building. There were some old, faded tire tracks, but nothing fresh. Nothing to indicate two heavy pickup trucks had been sitting there just a few nights before.

The officer looked at me. The polite disbelief was gone. Now it was just pity. ""Let's go, son,"" he said, gently.

I couldn't speak. I just stood there, staring at the hollow building, the empty pumps, the silent, sun-baked lot. It was real. I know it was. The woman, the coffee, the terror. But the evidence was gone, wiped clean by the light of day. It was a trap that materialized in the darkness and vanished with the dawn. A net cast for the lonely, the isolated, the ones no one would miss for a day or two.

I don't know what they are. Ghouls, opportunists, something in between. But they're out there. And they have a system. They know the empty roads, the dead zones. They set up their stage and they wait.

So this is my warning. To all of you who travel the lonely roads at night. If you're running on empty and you see a single, flickering light in the distance, a place that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't stop. I'm telling you, it is better to be stranded. It is better to run out of gas and wait for the sun. Because if you pull into that station, and a frail old woman tells you how scared she is of being alone, you need to understand that you're the one who should be scared. You're the reason she's not alone anymore. You're the fresh meat. And the hunters are waiting just out of sight.",3,1766523267.0,creepypasta,0,0.8,False

1pu4tbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pu4tbf/ive_been_driving_rigs_for_15_years_last_month_i/,"I’ve been driving rigs for 15 years. Last month, I pulled into the wrong gas station, and I’m lucky to be alive.","Alright, I don't know where else to put this. I tried to file a report, and the look I got from the officer was one step away from asking me to take a breathalyzer. My company dispatcher thinks I was hallucinating from exhaustion. But I know what I saw. I know what almost happened. I've been driving rigs for fifteen years, and I've seen some strange things on the asphalt sea, but nothing… nothing like this. So I’m putting it here. A warning. For any of you guys running the long haul, or even just a family on a road trip, burning the midnight oil to make it to grandma’s by morning. If you see this place, you push that pedal to the floor and you don't look back. You run on fumes if you have to. It's better than the alternative.

It happened about three weeks ago. I was on a cross-country run, hauling a load of non-perishables. The kind of gig that's more about endurance than anything else. Just you, the hum of the Cummins diesel, and the endless ribbon of blacktop unwinding in your high beams. The section of highway I was on is notoriously empty. It's a dead zone. No radio signal worth a damn, no cell service for a hundred miles in either direction. It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're the last person on Earth, a tiny capsule of light and noise moving through an infinite, silent void.

I'm usually pretty good with my fuel management. It's second nature after this long. But I'd been pushing it, trying to make up time I lost at the weigh station. The needle on the diesel gauge was kissing 'E' with a little too much affection. The low fuel light had been blinking patiently for the last twenty miles, a tiny orange beacon of my own stupidity. I started doing the math, calculating mileage, and a cold sweat started to prickle my neck. Getting stranded out here wasn't just an inconvenience; it was dangerous.

Just as a genuine knot of panic began to tighten in my stomach, I saw it. Up ahead, a faint, sickly yellow glow, bleeding into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't much, just a single light, but it was enough. As I got closer, the shape resolved itself. A small, single-story building with a low, flat roof and a short awning over a pair of fuel pumps. The sign was old, the kind with the plastic letters you can change by hand. A few letters were missing, so it read something like ""_AS & _AT."" The light I’d seen was coming from a single, flickering fluorescent bulb under the awning, which cast long, dancing shadows and made the whole place look like it was underwater.

Everything about it screamed ‘keep driving.’ The paint was peeling off the walls in long strips, like sunburnt skin. The pumps looked ancient, the kind with the rotating numbers instead of a digital display. The whole lot was cracked asphalt and weeds. But my gauge was now defiantly sitting on empty, and beggars can't be choosers. With a sigh that felt like it came from my boots, I geared down, the air brakes hissing in protest, and swung the big rig into the lot. The trailer tires crunched over loose gravel. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint, frantic chirping of crickets.

I climbed down from the cab, my legs stiff. The air was cool and smelled of dust and distant rain. Through the grimy plate-glass window of the station, I could see one person, a small figure standing behind a counter.

The bell above the door let out a weak, tinny jingle as I pushed it open. The inside smelled of stale coffee, dust, and something else… something vaguely metallic and sweet, like old pennies. The shelves were mostly bare. A few dusty cans of off-brand beans, a rack of sun-bleached chips, a cooler that hummed loudly but seemed to contain nothing but shadows. The only person there was an old woman.

She was tiny, almost bird-like, with a cloud of thin, white hair and a face that was a roadmap of wrinkles. She wore a faded floral-print dress and a grey cardigan pulled tight around her shoulders, even though it wasn't cold inside. The moment I stepped in, her head snapped up, and a wave of what I can only describe as profound relief washed over her features.

""Oh, thank heavens,"" she said, her voice thin and raspy, like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She put a trembling hand to her chest. ""You gave me a start, but I'm so glad to see you. I get so nervous out here all by myself at night.""

I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring nod. ""No problem, ma'am. Just need to fill up the tanks.""

""Of course, of course,"" she said, her eyes, which were surprisingly sharp and clear in her wrinkled face, darting to the window and back to me. ""It's just… the silence, you know? It gets so loud out here when you're all alone.""

I understood that. I really did. The loneliness of the road is a character all its own. ""I hear you,"" I said, pulling out my company card. ""It's a long way between towns on this stretch.""

""Isn't it just,"" she breathed, her eyes fixed on me. ""A long, long way. You headed east or west, dear?""

The question was normal enough. Gas station small talk. But the intensity in her gaze was a little off. ""East,"" I said. ""Got a load for the coast.""

""The coast,"" she repeated, almost dreamily. ""That's a good long drive. A real long drive. You must get awfully tired.""

""Part of the job,"" I shrugged. I tapped the card on the counter. ""Can I prepay for, say, two hundred on pump one?""

She didn't move to take the card. She just kept looking at me, her head tilted slightly. ""Will you be stopping again soon? Before you get to the city?""

Okay, this was getting weird. ""Probably not. Just want to get as many miles in as I can before sun-up.""

""So no one's really… expecting you?"" she asked, her voice dropping a little. ""No one's waiting for you at a motel or anything like that? You're just… out here. On your own.""

The way she said ‘on your own’ sent a little shiver down my spine. It was a statement. An observation. I felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to lie, to tell her my wife was waiting on the phone, that my dispatcher was tracking my every move. But the words caught in my throat. I just wanted to get my fuel and go.

""That's right,"" I said, my voice a little tighter than I intended. ""Just me and the road. The pump, ma'am?""

She finally blinked, a slow, deliberate motion, and a thin smile stretched her lips. ""Of course, dear. My apologies. My mind wanders."" She took the card and ran it through the ancient machine, her gnarled fingers moving with a slow, deliberate pace.

As the machine was processing, the tinny bell above the door jingled again. I turned. A man had entered. He was tall and lean, with the kind of weathered, leathery skin you get from a life spent outdoors. He wore a dirty flannel shirt and worn-out jeans. He didn't look at me, just let his eyes roam over the empty shelves, a strange, hungry look on his face. He walked with a slight limp, his boots scuffing quietly on the linoleum floor.

He ambled up to the counter, standing a few feet away from me, and leaned in towards the old woman. He still didn't acknowledge my presence. It was like I was a piece of furniture.

""Anything come in?"" he asked, his voice a low, gravelly rumble.

The old woman's smile tightened. She handed me my card back, but her eyes were on him. ""Not yet,"" she said, her voice now carrying a different tone. It was businesslike. Colder. ""Still waiting.""

The man grunted, sniffing the air. ""I'm getting hungry,"" he said, and turned his head and his eyes, dark and flat as river stones, flickered over me for a fraction of a second. They were completely devoid of emotion.

Then he looked back at the woman. ""Any fresh meat?""

My blood went cold. The phrase hung in the dusty air, thick and greasy. It had to be a joke. Some kind of local slang. Maybe they sold deer jerky, or they were hunters. That had to be it. My tired brain was making connections that weren't there.

The old woman didn't miss a beat. She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod in my direction. My back was mostly to her, but I saw it in the reflection on the grimy cooler door.

""There's fresh meat on the way,"" she said, her voice a low murmur. ""Just be patient.""

The man grunted again, a sound of satisfaction this time, and turned and walked out. The bell jingled his departure. I stood there for a second, my heart hammering against my ribs. 'Fresh meat on the way.' A trucker. Headed east. No one expecting him. Alone.

""Your pump is all set, dear,"" the old woman said, her voice back to that frail, sweet tone. It was like she’d flipped a switch.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. ""Thanks,"" I mumbled, turning and pushing the door open so hard the bell clanked against the glass.

The night air felt good, but it didn't wash away the sudden, slimy feeling of dread that had coated my skin. I tried to shake it off. I was tired. Overreacting. They were just weird locals with a weird sense of humor. I walked over to the pump, unscrewed the caps on my tanks, and grabbed the heavy diesel nozzle.

As I stood there, the pump chugging away, my eyes scanned the darkness. My rig was the only vehicle in the front lot. But my senses were on high alert now, and I was noticing things my tired brain had initially filtered out. I let my gaze drift past the station, to the dark, gravel area behind it.

And that's when I saw it.

Tucked away in the shadows, almost perfectly hidden from the road, was a pickup truck. It was an old model, beat to hell, with a mismatched fender and a dull, rusted paint job. Its lights were off. It was just sitting there, silent and waiting. As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I realized there was someone in the driver's seat, a silhouette against the slightly less black night sky.

A prickle of unease turned into a full-blown alarm bell in my head. Why park back there? Why with no lights?

Then, as I watched, another vehicle pulled in. It didn't come from the highway. It seemed to materialize from a dirt track that ran alongside the station. Another beat-up pickup, this one a dark blue, though it was hard to tell in the dim light. It coasted in just as silently as the first one, its engine a barely audible rumble before it was cut. It parked right next to the first one, also in the shadows, also with its lights off. Two men got out of that one, moving with a quiet purpose that was anything but casual. They didn't go into the station. They just leaned against their truck and waited, their faces obscured by the darkness.

I felt like I was watching a scene from a movie I didn't want to be in. The pieces started clicking into place with a horrifying, metallic certainty. 
The pump clicked off, the tank full. My hands were shaking as I hung up the nozzle and screwed the cap back on. My mind was racing. I had to get out of there. Now. I didn't even bother filling the second tank. To hell with the money. Every second I spent here felt like a lifetime borrowed on credit I didn't have.

I practically jogged back to my cab, my boots crunching loud in the terrible silence. I kept my eyes on the station, expecting the someone to come back out, or the guys from the pickups to start walking towards me. But nothing happened.

Just as my hand reached the handle of my truck door, the station door opened. It was the old woman. She was holding a steaming styrofoam cup.

""Oh, dear, you forgot this!"" she called out, her voice carrying that same frail, grandmotherly tone. But it sounded grotesque to me now, a mask.

She started walking towards me, one slow, shuffling step at a time. ""I made a fresh pot of coffee. You looked so tired, I thought you could use it. It's on the house. A little something to keep you awake on that long road.""

My entire body screamed NO. Every instinct, every primal, self-preserving fiber of my being wanted me to get in the cab, lock the door, and lay on the horn until my hand broke.

But I was frozen. If I refused, what then? Would they just drop the act? Would the men from the trucks come out of the shadows? The charade, however thin, felt like the only thing keeping me alive right now. Playing along might buy me a few precious seconds.

She reached me, her hand trembling as she held out the cup. Or was it trembling? Looking closer, her hand was steady as a rock. It was the cup that was vibrating from the sloshing of the hot liquid. Her eyes, those piercingly clear eyes, were locked on mine. They weren't kind. They were expectant.

""You take this,"" she insisted, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""It'll help you. You need to rest.""

I took the cup. Her skin was cold and dry as paper where her fingers brushed mine. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" I managed to choke out. The words felt like ash in my mouth.

""You're very welcome, dear,"" she said, that thin smile returning. ""Drive safe now.""

She turned and shuffled back to the station, disappearing inside. I didn't wait to watch the door close. I scrambled up into my cab, slammed the door, and hit the locks. My heart was a wild bird beating against my ribs. I jammed the key in the ignition and the diesel engine roared to life, shattering the night's silence. The coffee cup sat in my cup holder, radiating a sickening, artificial warmth. I didn't dare spill it. I didn't dare throw it out the window. I just left it there, a symbol of how close I'd come.

I put the truck in gear and pulled out of that godforsaken lot, my tires spitting gravel. I didn't look at the station in my side mirror. I looked at the mirror pointed towards the back of the station.

As I rolled onto the highway, two pairs of headlights flicked on in the darkness behind the building.

They pulled out after me, falling into formation about a quarter-mile back. They didn't speed up. They didn't flash their lights. They just followed. Two beat-up pickup trucks, the silent partners in this nightmare. My blood ran cold. This was it. The hunt was on.

My foot pressed the accelerator to the floor. The rig groaned, slowly picking up speed. 60. 70. 80. I was pushing it far beyond the safe limit, the trailer swaying slightly behind me. But every time I looked in the mirror, the two sets of headlights were still there, maintaining their distance, two pairs of predatory eyes in the black.

I grabbed my phone. Just as I suspected. No Service. I was completely and utterly alone.

The next few hours were the purest form of terror I have ever known. It wasn't a slasher-movie, jump-scare kind of fear. It was a slow, grinding, psychological horror. The road stretched on, an endless black void. There were no other cars. No exits. No signs of civilization. Just me, my roaring engine, and the two sets of lights behind me.

They were herding me. I knew it. They were patient. They knew this stretch of road. They knew there was nowhere for me to go. They were just waiting. Waiting for me to make a mistake. Waiting for my nerve to break. Or, if their original plan had worked, waiting for the drugs in the coffee to kick in and do the job for them. I glanced at the cup, still sitting there. I imagined myself getting drowsy, my eyelids feeling like lead, pulling over to the shoulder… I shook my head violently, forcing the image out.

My mind raced through scenarios. What did they want? The truck? The cargo? No. The man's words echoed in my head. ‘Fresh meat.’ It wasn't about my rig. It was about me.

I thought about slamming on the brakes, trying to get them to crash into my trailer. But they were keeping their distance, and what if I just jackknifed the rig? I'd be a sitting duck, trapped in a wreck. I thought about trying to call them on the CB, but what would I say? And what if they answered? The thought of hearing one of their voices crackle over the radio was somehow more terrifying than the silence.

So I just drove. I drove with my eyes glued to the road ahead and the mirror. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. My body was drenched in a cold sweat. Every shadow on the side of the road was a new threat, every bend a potential ambush. The hum of the engine was my only ally. As long as it was running, I was moving. As long as I was moving, I was alive.

The night seemed to stretch into eternity. Time lost all meaning. There was only the road, the engine, the fear, and the lights. They never wavered, never got closer, never fell further behind. They were a constant, terrifying presence. A promise of what was waiting for me if I stopped.

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, I saw it. A faint, almost imperceptible lightening of the sky on the eastern horizon. At first, I thought my tired eyes were playing tricks on me. But it grew, a line of pale grey, then a soft, bruised purple. Dawn.

I didn't let myself feel hope. It felt too much like a trap. But as the sun began to properly crest the horizon, painting the desolate landscape in shades of orange and pink, something happened.

I looked in my mirror. The headlights behind me were gone.

I scanned the road behind me, my heart in my throat. The two pickup trucks were still there, but they were falling back. Rapidly. As the first rays of direct sunlight spilled over the plains and hit my windshield, I looked in the mirror one last time. The two trucks were making a sharp, synchronized U-turn in the middle of the empty highway, and speeding off in the direction we'd come from.

They were gone.

Just like that. The sunlight had saved me. It was like they were creatures of the dark, unable or unwilling to operate in the light of day where they could be seen, identified.

I drove for another ten miles, my body shaking with adrenaline and relief, before I finally pulled over. I killed the engine and the silence that rushed in was beautiful. It was the silence of survival. I sat there for a long time, watching the sun climb higher in the sky, just breathing. My eyes fell on the styrofoam cup. With a convulsive, angry movement, I snatched it, rolled down the window, and hurled it out into the desert. I watched it tumble into a ditch, a tiny, harmless-looking piece of white trash that held a death sentence.

I finished my haul. I delivered my load. I did it on autopilot, the terror of that night replaying in a constant loop in my head. I looked like hell, and my boss told me to take a few days off. The first thing I did was go to the state police barracks for the county where the station was.

I sat in a sterile interrogation room and told my story to a weary-looking officer with a thick mustache. I told him everything. The station, the old woman, her questions, the man, the phrase 'fresh meat', the trucks, the coffee, the chase. He wrote it all down, but the look on his face was one of polite, professional disbelief.

""So,"" he said, tapping his pen on his notepad. ""You're saying this gas station, which isn't on any of our maps, by the way, is a front for some kind of… hunting party? And they chase truckers through the night?""

""I'm telling you what happened,"" I said, my voice tight. ""That coffee was drugged. They were going to kill me.""

""And you have this coffee?""

""I threw it out! I was terrified!""

He sighed. ""Look, sir. You truckers drive long hours. The mind can play tricks on you when you're fatigued.""

I insisted. I gave him the mile marker where I thought it was. I described the turnoff. I told him he had to check it out. To his credit, and probably just to shut me up, he agreed to humor me. He said he'd take a drive out there when he had a chance. I knew that meant never. So I pushed. I told him I'd ride with him. I'd show him the exact spot. After a long argument, he reluctantly agreed, probably thinking it was the fastest way to prove me crazy.

So the next day, I was in the passenger seat of his cruiser, driving back down that same dark stretch of highway, this time in the bright, unforgiving light of day. My stomach was in knots.

""It should be right up here,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Around this bend.""

We came around the bend, and there it was. The dirt turnoff. The cracked asphalt lot. The single-story building with the low, flat roof.

""See?"" I said, a wave of vindication washing over me. ""I told you.""

The officer didn't say anything. He just pulled the cruiser into the lot and put it in park. We both got out.

The building was there. But it wasn't a gas station.

It was a derelict. A shell. The windows were boarded up from the inside, thick with cobwebs and grime. The door was hanging off one hinge, held shut by a rusty padlock. The sign that had read ""_AS & _AT"" was just a rusted metal frame, the plastic long gone. The pumps were there, but they were skeletal remains, their hoses rotted away, their metal casings pitted with rust and time. I walked over and looked at the dial. It was rusted solid. These things hadn't pumped a gallon of fuel in thirty years.

""This is it?"" the officer asked, his voice flat.

I walked over to the building and peered through a crack in the boarded-up window. I expected to see the dusty shelves, the counter, the cooler.

There was nothing.

The inside was completely, totally empty. It was a single, hollow room. Bare floorboards, crumbling drywall. No counter. No shelves. No wiring for a cooler. There was a thick layer of dust on the floor that was completely undisturbed. No footprints. No sign that anyone had been inside for decades.

It was a ghost. An empty stage.

We checked the gravel lot behind the building. There were some old, faded tire tracks, but nothing fresh. Nothing to indicate two heavy pickup trucks had been sitting there just a few nights before.

The officer looked at me. The polite disbelief was gone. Now it was just pity. ""Let's go, son,"" he said, gently.

I couldn't speak. I just stood there, staring at the hollow building, the empty pumps, the silent, sun-baked lot. It was real. I know it was. The woman, the coffee, the terror. But the evidence was gone, wiped clean by the light of day. It was a trap that materialized in the darkness and vanished with the dawn. A net cast for the lonely, the isolated, the ones no one would miss for a day or two.

I don't know what they are. Ghouls, opportunists, something in between. But they're out there. And they have a system. They know the empty roads, the dead zones. They set up their stage and they wait.

So this is my warning. To all of you who travel the lonely roads at night. If you're running on empty and you see a single, flickering light in the distance, a place that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't stop. I'm telling you, it is better to be stranded. It is better to run out of gas and wait for the sun. Because if you pull into that station, and a frail old woman tells you how scared she is of being alone, you need to understand that you're the one who should be scared. You're the reason she's not alone anymore. You're the fresh meat. And the hunters are waiting just out of sight.",3,1766523226.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1pu4sqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pu4sqt/ive_been_driving_rigs_for_15_years_last_month_i/,"I’ve been driving rigs for 15 years. Last month, I pulled into the wrong gas station, and I’m lucky to be alive.","Alright, I don't know where else to put this. I tried to file a report, and the look I got from the officer was one step away from asking me to take a breathalyzer. My company dispatcher thinks I was hallucinating from exhaustion. But I know what I saw. I know what almost happened. I've been driving rigs for fifteen years, and I've seen some strange things on the asphalt sea, but nothing… nothing like this. So I’m putting it here. A warning. For any of you guys running the long haul, or even just a family on a road trip, burning the midnight oil to make it to grandma’s by morning. If you see this place, you push that pedal to the floor and you don't look back. You run on fumes if you have to. It's better than the alternative.

It happened about three weeks ago. I was on a cross-country run, hauling a load of non-perishables. The kind of gig that's more about endurance than anything else. Just you, the hum of the Cummins diesel, and the endless ribbon of blacktop unwinding in your high beams. The section of highway I was on is notoriously empty. It's a dead zone. No radio signal worth a damn, no cell service for a hundred miles in either direction. It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're the last person on Earth, a tiny capsule of light and noise moving through an infinite, silent void.

I'm usually pretty good with my fuel management. It's second nature after this long. But I'd been pushing it, trying to make up time I lost at the weigh station. The needle on the diesel gauge was kissing 'E' with a little too much affection. The low fuel light had been blinking patiently for the last twenty miles, a tiny orange beacon of my own stupidity. I started doing the math, calculating mileage, and a cold sweat started to prickle my neck. Getting stranded out here wasn't just an inconvenience; it was dangerous.

Just as a genuine knot of panic began to tighten in my stomach, I saw it. Up ahead, a faint, sickly yellow glow, bleeding into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't much, just a single light, but it was enough. As I got closer, the shape resolved itself. A small, single-story building with a low, flat roof and a short awning over a pair of fuel pumps. The sign was old, the kind with the plastic letters you can change by hand. A few letters were missing, so it read something like ""_AS & _AT."" The light I’d seen was coming from a single, flickering fluorescent bulb under the awning, which cast long, dancing shadows and made the whole place look like it was underwater.

Everything about it screamed ‘keep driving.’ The paint was peeling off the walls in long strips, like sunburnt skin. The pumps looked ancient, the kind with the rotating numbers instead of a digital display. The whole lot was cracked asphalt and weeds. But my gauge was now defiantly sitting on empty, and beggars can't be choosers. With a sigh that felt like it came from my boots, I geared down, the air brakes hissing in protest, and swung the big rig into the lot. The trailer tires crunched over loose gravel. I killed the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent light and the faint, frantic chirping of crickets.

I climbed down from the cab, my legs stiff. The air was cool and smelled of dust and distant rain. Through the grimy plate-glass window of the station, I could see one person, a small figure standing behind a counter.

The bell above the door let out a weak, tinny jingle as I pushed it open. The inside smelled of stale coffee, dust, and something else… something vaguely metallic and sweet, like old pennies. The shelves were mostly bare. A few dusty cans of off-brand beans, a rack of sun-bleached chips, a cooler that hummed loudly but seemed to contain nothing but shadows. The only person there was an old woman.

She was tiny, almost bird-like, with a cloud of thin, white hair and a face that was a roadmap of wrinkles. She wore a faded floral-print dress and a grey cardigan pulled tight around her shoulders, even though it wasn't cold inside. The moment I stepped in, her head snapped up, and a wave of what I can only describe as profound relief washed over her features.

""Oh, thank heavens,"" she said, her voice thin and raspy, like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She put a trembling hand to her chest. ""You gave me a start, but I'm so glad to see you. I get so nervous out here all by myself at night.""

I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring nod. ""No problem, ma'am. Just need to fill up the tanks.""

""Of course, of course,"" she said, her eyes, which were surprisingly sharp and clear in her wrinkled face, darting to the window and back to me. ""It's just… the silence, you know? It gets so loud out here when you're all alone.""

I understood that. I really did. The loneliness of the road is a character all its own. ""I hear you,"" I said, pulling out my company card. ""It's a long way between towns on this stretch.""

""Isn't it just,"" she breathed, her eyes fixed on me. ""A long, long way. You headed east or west, dear?""

The question was normal enough. Gas station small talk. But the intensity in her gaze was a little off. ""East,"" I said. ""Got a load for the coast.""

""The coast,"" she repeated, almost dreamily. ""That's a good long drive. A real long drive. You must get awfully tired.""

""Part of the job,"" I shrugged. I tapped the card on the counter. ""Can I prepay for, say, two hundred on pump one?""

She didn't move to take the card. She just kept looking at me, her head tilted slightly. ""Will you be stopping again soon? Before you get to the city?""

Okay, this was getting weird. ""Probably not. Just want to get as many miles in as I can before sun-up.""

""So no one's really… expecting you?"" she asked, her voice dropping a little. ""No one's waiting for you at a motel or anything like that? You're just… out here. On your own.""

The way she said ‘on your own’ sent a little shiver down my spine. It was a statement. An observation. I felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to lie, to tell her my wife was waiting on the phone, that my dispatcher was tracking my every move. But the words caught in my throat. I just wanted to get my fuel and go.

""That's right,"" I said, my voice a little tighter than I intended. ""Just me and the road. The pump, ma'am?""

She finally blinked, a slow, deliberate motion, and a thin smile stretched her lips. ""Of course, dear. My apologies. My mind wanders."" She took the card and ran it through the ancient machine, her gnarled fingers moving with a slow, deliberate pace.

As the machine was processing, the tinny bell above the door jingled again. I turned. A man had entered. He was tall and lean, with the kind of weathered, leathery skin you get from a life spent outdoors. He wore a dirty flannel shirt and worn-out jeans. He didn't look at me, just let his eyes roam over the empty shelves, a strange, hungry look on his face. He walked with a slight limp, his boots scuffing quietly on the linoleum floor.

He ambled up to the counter, standing a few feet away from me, and leaned in towards the old woman. He still didn't acknowledge my presence. It was like I was a piece of furniture.

""Anything come in?"" he asked, his voice a low, gravelly rumble.

The old woman's smile tightened. She handed me my card back, but her eyes were on him. ""Not yet,"" she said, her voice now carrying a different tone. It was businesslike. Colder. ""Still waiting.""

The man grunted, sniffing the air. ""I'm getting hungry,"" he said, and turned his head and his eyes, dark and flat as river stones, flickered over me for a fraction of a second. They were completely devoid of emotion.

Then he looked back at the woman. ""Any fresh meat?""

My blood went cold. The phrase hung in the dusty air, thick and greasy. It had to be a joke. Some kind of local slang. Maybe they sold deer jerky, or they were hunters. That had to be it. My tired brain was making connections that weren't there.

The old woman didn't miss a beat. She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod in my direction. My back was mostly to her, but I saw it in the reflection on the grimy cooler door.

""There's fresh meat on the way,"" she said, her voice a low murmur. ""Just be patient.""

The man grunted again, a sound of satisfaction this time, and turned and walked out. The bell jingled his departure. I stood there for a second, my heart hammering against my ribs. 'Fresh meat on the way.' A trucker. Headed east. No one expecting him. Alone.

""Your pump is all set, dear,"" the old woman said, her voice back to that frail, sweet tone. It was like she’d flipped a switch.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. ""Thanks,"" I mumbled, turning and pushing the door open so hard the bell clanked against the glass.

The night air felt good, but it didn't wash away the sudden, slimy feeling of dread that had coated my skin. I tried to shake it off. I was tired. Overreacting. They were just weird locals with a weird sense of humor. I walked over to the pump, unscrewed the caps on my tanks, and grabbed the heavy diesel nozzle.

As I stood there, the pump chugging away, my eyes scanned the darkness. My rig was the only vehicle in the front lot. But my senses were on high alert now, and I was noticing things my tired brain had initially filtered out. I let my gaze drift past the station, to the dark, gravel area behind it.

And that's when I saw it.

Tucked away in the shadows, almost perfectly hidden from the road, was a pickup truck. It was an old model, beat to hell, with a mismatched fender and a dull, rusted paint job. Its lights were off. It was just sitting there, silent and waiting. As my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I realized there was someone in the driver's seat, a silhouette against the slightly less black night sky.

A prickle of unease turned into a full-blown alarm bell in my head. Why park back there? Why with no lights?

Then, as I watched, another vehicle pulled in. It didn't come from the highway. It seemed to materialize from a dirt track that ran alongside the station. Another beat-up pickup, this one a dark blue, though it was hard to tell in the dim light. It coasted in just as silently as the first one, its engine a barely audible rumble before it was cut. It parked right next to the first one, also in the shadows, also with its lights off. Two men got out of that one, moving with a quiet purpose that was anything but casual. They didn't go into the station. They just leaned against their truck and waited, their faces obscured by the darkness.

I felt like I was watching a scene from a movie I didn't want to be in. The pieces started clicking into place with a horrifying, metallic certainty. 
The pump clicked off, the tank full. My hands were shaking as I hung up the nozzle and screwed the cap back on. My mind was racing. I had to get out of there. Now. I didn't even bother filling the second tank. To hell with the money. Every second I spent here felt like a lifetime borrowed on credit I didn't have.

I practically jogged back to my cab, my boots crunching loud in the terrible silence. I kept my eyes on the station, expecting the someone to come back out, or the guys from the pickups to start walking towards me. But nothing happened.

Just as my hand reached the handle of my truck door, the station door opened. It was the old woman. She was holding a steaming styrofoam cup.

""Oh, dear, you forgot this!"" she called out, her voice carrying that same frail, grandmotherly tone. But it sounded grotesque to me now, a mask.

She started walking towards me, one slow, shuffling step at a time. ""I made a fresh pot of coffee. You looked so tired, I thought you could use it. It's on the house. A little something to keep you awake on that long road.""

My entire body screamed NO. Every instinct, every primal, self-preserving fiber of my being wanted me to get in the cab, lock the door, and lay on the horn until my hand broke.

But I was frozen. If I refused, what then? Would they just drop the act? Would the men from the trucks come out of the shadows? The charade, however thin, felt like the only thing keeping me alive right now. Playing along might buy me a few precious seconds.

She reached me, her hand trembling as she held out the cup. Or was it trembling? Looking closer, her hand was steady as a rock. It was the cup that was vibrating from the sloshing of the hot liquid. Her eyes, those piercingly clear eyes, were locked on mine. They weren't kind. They were expectant.

""You take this,"" she insisted, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""It'll help you. You need to rest.""

I took the cup. Her skin was cold and dry as paper where her fingers brushed mine. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" I managed to choke out. The words felt like ash in my mouth.

""You're very welcome, dear,"" she said, that thin smile returning. ""Drive safe now.""

She turned and shuffled back to the station, disappearing inside. I didn't wait to watch the door close. I scrambled up into my cab, slammed the door, and hit the locks. My heart was a wild bird beating against my ribs. I jammed the key in the ignition and the diesel engine roared to life, shattering the night's silence. The coffee cup sat in my cup holder, radiating a sickening, artificial warmth. I didn't dare spill it. I didn't dare throw it out the window. I just left it there, a symbol of how close I'd come.

I put the truck in gear and pulled out of that godforsaken lot, my tires spitting gravel. I didn't look at the station in my side mirror. I looked at the mirror pointed towards the back of the station.

As I rolled onto the highway, two pairs of headlights flicked on in the darkness behind the building.

They pulled out after me, falling into formation about a quarter-mile back. They didn't speed up. They didn't flash their lights. They just followed. Two beat-up pickup trucks, the silent partners in this nightmare. My blood ran cold. This was it. The hunt was on.

My foot pressed the accelerator to the floor. The rig groaned, slowly picking up speed. 60. 70. 80. I was pushing it far beyond the safe limit, the trailer swaying slightly behind me. But every time I looked in the mirror, the two sets of headlights were still there, maintaining their distance, two pairs of predatory eyes in the black.

I grabbed my phone. Just as I suspected. No Service. I was completely and utterly alone.

The next few hours were the purest form of terror I have ever known. It wasn't a slasher-movie, jump-scare kind of fear. It was a slow, grinding, psychological horror. The road stretched on, an endless black void. There were no other cars. No exits. No signs of civilization. Just me, my roaring engine, and the two sets of lights behind me.

They were herding me. I knew it. They were patient. They knew this stretch of road. They knew there was nowhere for me to go. They were just waiting. Waiting for me to make a mistake. Waiting for my nerve to break. Or, if their original plan had worked, waiting for the drugs in the coffee to kick in and do the job for them. I glanced at the cup, still sitting there. I imagined myself getting drowsy, my eyelids feeling like lead, pulling over to the shoulder… I shook my head violently, forcing the image out.

My mind raced through scenarios. What did they want? The truck? The cargo? No. The man's words echoed in my head. ‘Fresh meat.’ It wasn't about my rig. It was about me.

I thought about slamming on the brakes, trying to get them to crash into my trailer. But they were keeping their distance, and what if I just jackknifed the rig? I'd be a sitting duck, trapped in a wreck. I thought about trying to call them on the CB, but what would I say? And what if they answered? The thought of hearing one of their voices crackle over the radio was somehow more terrifying than the silence.

So I just drove. I drove with my eyes glued to the road ahead and the mirror. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. My body was drenched in a cold sweat. Every shadow on the side of the road was a new threat, every bend a potential ambush. The hum of the engine was my only ally. As long as it was running, I was moving. As long as I was moving, I was alive.

The night seemed to stretch into eternity. Time lost all meaning. There was only the road, the engine, the fear, and the lights. They never wavered, never got closer, never fell further behind. They were a constant, terrifying presence. A promise of what was waiting for me if I stopped.

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, I saw it. A faint, almost imperceptible lightening of the sky on the eastern horizon. At first, I thought my tired eyes were playing tricks on me. But it grew, a line of pale grey, then a soft, bruised purple. Dawn.

I didn't let myself feel hope. It felt too much like a trap. But as the sun began to properly crest the horizon, painting the desolate landscape in shades of orange and pink, something happened.

I looked in my mirror. The headlights behind me were gone.

I scanned the road behind me, my heart in my throat. The two pickup trucks were still there, but they were falling back. Rapidly. As the first rays of direct sunlight spilled over the plains and hit my windshield, I looked in the mirror one last time. The two trucks were making a sharp, synchronized U-turn in the middle of the empty highway, and speeding off in the direction we'd come from.

They were gone.

Just like that. The sunlight had saved me. It was like they were creatures of the dark, unable or unwilling to operate in the light of day where they could be seen, identified.

I drove for another ten miles, my body shaking with adrenaline and relief, before I finally pulled over. I killed the engine and the silence that rushed in was beautiful. It was the silence of survival. I sat there for a long time, watching the sun climb higher in the sky, just breathing. My eyes fell on the styrofoam cup. With a convulsive, angry movement, I snatched it, rolled down the window, and hurled it out into the desert. I watched it tumble into a ditch, a tiny, harmless-looking piece of white trash that held a death sentence.

I finished my haul. I delivered my load. I did it on autopilot, the terror of that night replaying in a constant loop in my head. I looked like hell, and my boss told me to take a few days off. The first thing I did was go to the state police barracks for the county where the station was.

I sat in a sterile interrogation room and told my story to a weary-looking officer with a thick mustache. I told him everything. The station, the old woman, her questions, the man, the phrase 'fresh meat', the trucks, the coffee, the chase. He wrote it all down, but the look on his face was one of polite, professional disbelief.

""So,"" he said, tapping his pen on his notepad. ""You're saying this gas station, which isn't on any of our maps, by the way, is a front for some kind of… hunting party? And they chase truckers through the night?""

""I'm telling you what happened,"" I said, my voice tight. ""That coffee was drugged. They were going to kill me.""

""And you have this coffee?""

""I threw it out! I was terrified!""

He sighed. ""Look, sir. You truckers drive long hours. The mind can play tricks on you when you're fatigued.""

I insisted. I gave him the mile marker where I thought it was. I described the turnoff. I told him he had to check it out. To his credit, and probably just to shut me up, he agreed to humor me. He said he'd take a drive out there when he had a chance. I knew that meant never. So I pushed. I told him I'd ride with him. I'd show him the exact spot. After a long argument, he reluctantly agreed, probably thinking it was the fastest way to prove me crazy.

So the next day, I was in the passenger seat of his cruiser, driving back down that same dark stretch of highway, this time in the bright, unforgiving light of day. My stomach was in knots.

""It should be right up here,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Around this bend.""

We came around the bend, and there it was. The dirt turnoff. The cracked asphalt lot. The single-story building with the low, flat roof.

""See?"" I said, a wave of vindication washing over me. ""I told you.""

The officer didn't say anything. He just pulled the cruiser into the lot and put it in park. We both got out.

The building was there. But it wasn't a gas station.

It was a derelict. A shell. The windows were boarded up from the inside, thick with cobwebs and grime. The door was hanging off one hinge, held shut by a rusty padlock. The sign that had read ""_AS & _AT"" was just a rusted metal frame, the plastic long gone. The pumps were there, but they were skeletal remains, their hoses rotted away, their metal casings pitted with rust and time. I walked over and looked at the dial. It was rusted solid. These things hadn't pumped a gallon of fuel in thirty years.

""This is it?"" the officer asked, his voice flat.

I walked over to the building and peered through a crack in the boarded-up window. I expected to see the dusty shelves, the counter, the cooler.

There was nothing.

The inside was completely, totally empty. It was a single, hollow room. Bare floorboards, crumbling drywall. No counter. No shelves. No wiring for a cooler. There was a thick layer of dust on the floor that was completely undisturbed. No footprints. No sign that anyone had been inside for decades.

It was a ghost. An empty stage.

We checked the gravel lot behind the building. There were some old, faded tire tracks, but nothing fresh. Nothing to indicate two heavy pickup trucks had been sitting there just a few nights before.

The officer looked at me. The polite disbelief was gone. Now it was just pity. ""Let's go, son,"" he said, gently.

I couldn't speak. I just stood there, staring at the hollow building, the empty pumps, the silent, sun-baked lot. It was real. I know it was. The woman, the coffee, the terror. But the evidence was gone, wiped clean by the light of day. It was a trap that materialized in the darkness and vanished with the dawn. A net cast for the lonely, the isolated, the ones no one would miss for a day or two.

I don't know what they are. Ghouls, opportunists, something in between. But they're out there. And they have a system. They know the empty roads, the dead zones. They set up their stage and they wait.

So this is my warning. To all of you who travel the lonely roads at night. If you're running on empty and you see a single, flickering light in the distance, a place that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't stop. I'm telling you, it is better to be stranded. It is better to run out of gas and wait for the sun. Because if you pull into that station, and a frail old woman tells you how scared she is of being alone, you need to understand that you're the one who should be scared. You're the reason she's not alone anymore. You're the fresh meat. And the hunters are waiting just out of sight.",10,1766523186.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I've been thinking about contacting them and inviting them to grab coffee together sometime, but I can't tell if it is truly appropriate. 

**For some context:** I am currently taking a gap year, because things didn't turn out as I planned and it was my only option. I am also planning to retake some english exams - because I was given the option to raise my score and it would be a way to prevent me from ""falling out of the study loop"".   
That information is probably important, because two of those teachers who I plan to/am thinking about contacting are english teachers (one has even offered to help me with preparations for the exam). So maybe it's not a bad idea to reach out?

There is also the problem of actually carrying out the plan (if it is okay to do so), because while they are colleagues, I could imagine that it might me a little weird if the three of them are invited to catch up with a single student.  
But if I were to reach out to them and ask them to individually meet up with them, then the third teacher absolutely wouldn't be an option since he is in his late 40s and I am a 19 year old ex female student - so this is a definite no, because I am not looking to stir up any drama, accusations or give off the wrong and inappropriate impression.

Yet at the end of the day, the three of them are all my mentors and have shaped me into the person I am proud to be today. All three of them went out of their way to look out for me, guide me and be there for me. So if there is a way for me to stay in contact with them and not let these meaningful connections slowly fade overtime, then please let me know.

How would you as teachers react to an ex student inviting you to catch up? And am I looking into this too much and making this way harder than it actually is?

1pu4qmx,https://i.redd.it/nh1tvqaqn09g1.png,Critique my note app :),"To help myself capture thoughts before they disappear, I built a simple note taking app with one goal: **remove as much friction as possible** between a thought and saving it.

I started building Jot because I could not find a note app that worked for how my brain actually functions. A lot of my best ideas show up when I am out on walks with AirPods in. Most apps require too many taps or force you to decide what something is before you have even captured it. That decision alone was often enough for me to give up.

What I wanted was unfiltered brain dumps by voice, fast enough that I could just speak and keep moving. Later, I could come back and organize things when I actually had the energy. I also wanted to share entire folders with family and friends, recall notes using Siri, and keep everything inside iCloud with no separate account or login.

I shared an early version with friends and family and got great feedback. Since then I have cleaned up the UX, improved voice capture, and tightened the overall flow so it feels natural to use day to day. At this point, I use it constantly and it finally feels like the tool I was trying to find in the first place.

Early users said the biggest benefit is that it removes the pressure to be organized upfront. You dump everything out first, then decide what to do with it later. Several people with ADHD tendencies said that alone made it easier to stick with.

The app is free to use. There is an optional Pro upgrade for $14.99 lifetime that unlocks additional features. If you want a coupon for Lifetime Pro, just DM me and I am happy to share one.

I would genuinely love feedback from people who do not know me.

Do you struggle with capturing thoughts before they vanish? Does voice first note taking help, or do you still prefer typing everything out?

**Features:**

* Voice first brain dumps
* Fast text notes with minimal structure
* Folder based organization
* Share entire folders with others
* Full Siri support for capture and recall
* iCloud sync with no separate account
* Widgets and themes

1pu4osl,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/1pu4osl/worcester_is_still_being_kept/,Worcester Is Still Being Kept,"*A short allegorical reflection on Worcester and endurance.*

The city of Worcester, Massachusetts, lay cupped among its hills like a weathered vessel that had crossed too many seasons to be pretty but too many storms to be broken. Its streets curved with memory. Mill brick darkened by soot still breathed, and the rails that once carried industry now carried echoes. Snow knew the city well. So did struggle. So did staying.

There was a Keeper of the City, though few spoke of Him plainly. He did not live in City Hall, nor did He appear at ribbon cuttings or press conferences. His name was not etched into granite or cast in bronze. Yet He knew every alley behind Main Street, every triple decker sagging under time, every church whose steeple still pointed upward even when its doors were locked.

He watched over Kelley Square as it twisted and turned, confusing strangers and testing patience. He stood unseen near Lincoln Square when tempers flared and decisions were made that changed lives forever. He lingered by the Common when leaves fell and children laughed, and He stayed late on winter nights when the benches stood empty and the wind carried prayers no one dared speak aloud.

The people often said Worcester had been passed over. Not big enough. Not polished enough. Always becoming, never arriving. They spoke of Boston as if it were a distant capital and New York as if it were another world entirely. But the Keeper never measured the city by comparison. He measured it by weight. The weight of endurance. The weight of labor. The weight of lives that learned how to work with their hands and carry burdens quietly.

When factories closed and jobs vanished, the Keeper did not leave. He walked the length of Belmont Street and Park Avenue alike. He listened in diners where coffee was poured without ceremony and in kitchens where rent was overdue and hope felt thin. He heard prayers whispered in Portuguese, Spanish, English, and tongues shaped by hardship rather than schooling.

There were seasons when violence pressed close and fear learned the shortcuts between neighborhoods. Sirens cut through the night near Grafton Hill and Vernon Hill. On those nights, the Keeper stood watch. He allowed the city to be shaken but not erased. He let consequences fall, but He restrained destruction. The city bent, but it did not fold.

Worcester had always been a city of second chances, though it rarely advertised the fact. People came to disappear and found instead that they were seen. They came to rebuild quietly, unnoticed, and the Keeper honored that work. He favored the unseen faithfulness of nurses, mechanics, teachers, and janitors over the speeches of men who promised renewal without cost.

The city still carries its scars. Empty buildings. Worn sidewalks. Stories that do not resolve neatly. Yet the Keeper remains. He keeps the trains running, the seasons turning, the hearts stirring. He guards the city not with spectacle, but with purpose. And though few name Him, Worcester stands because it is kept.",8,1766522907.0,WorcesterMA,1,0.83,False

1pu4m46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pu4m46/tuesday_heartbreak/,Tuesday Heartbreak,"Tuesday ain’t just a day no more. It’s a wound. A slow bleed. A bruise that never yellows, never fades. Steven carries it like a hymn stuck in his throat, humming low and bitter every time the calendar turns its face toward that cursed day.

He used to love Tuesdays. That was their day. Her day. Cinnamon coffee and jazz records. Her laugh like a saxophone solo…an unexpected, off-beat, but always landing right. They’d sit on the stoop, her legs draped over his lap, talking about everything and nothing. She’d twist his locs between her fingers like she was braiding time, and he’d let her, thinking maybe if she wove tight enough, she’d never leave.

But she did.

Left on a Tuesday. No note. No goodbye. Just a half-empty mug and the ghost of her perfume clinging to the air like a stubborn spirit.

Now every Tuesday, Steven wakes up with a weight on his chest. Not the poetic kind. The real kind. Like someone’s sitting on him, daring him to breathe. He don’t shave. Don’t eat. Don’t answer the phone. He just stares at the wall, counting the cracks like tally marks in a cell. The clock ticks like a metronome, but the music’s gone.

He’s got a record player, still. Dusty. The needle’s bent, but he plays Talking Book anyway. “Tuesday Heartbreak” by Stevie Wonder spins, warbling like a drunk preacher. Stevie’s voice is velvet and vinegar, sweet and stinging.

“Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair…” 

Steven nods like it’s gospel. Because it is.

He writes her name on the wall every Tuesday. Not with ink. With breath. With memory. With the ache that lives behind his ribs. Her name is a psalm and a curse. He whispers it like prayer, hoping maybe she’ll hear it wherever she is. Maybe she’ll feel the pull. Maybe she’ll come back.

But she don’t.

The city moves on without him. Buses hiss. Kids laugh. Lovers argue and make up. But Steven is stuck in a loop. A vinyl groove carved too deep. Tuesday to Tuesday, sorrow to sorrow.

His friends tried. At first. Knocked on his door. Left food. Called. But grief makes people uncomfortable. It don’t smell good. Don’t smile back. So they stopped coming. And Steven stopped expecting.

He started writing letters he never sent. Poems that bled. Verses that rhymed with regret. He’d spit bars into the mirror, Talib-style, trying to cipher his way out of the pain:

“She left on a Tuesday, now I’m bruised in the brain,

Every week I relive it, like a looped hurricane.

My heart’s a vinyl scratch, stuck in Stevie’s refrain,

Tryna find the sun but I’m soaked in the rain.”

He laughed once after that. Just once. It sounded like breaking glass.

This Tuesday, the sky is gray. Not metaphor-gray. Just gray. Cold. Honest. Steven stands at the edge of the bridge, wind tugging at his coat like a child begging him not to go. Below, the river churns like a sermon.

He closes his eyes.

But then—soft. A sound. A voice. Not hers. But close.

“Steven?”

He turns. It’s Marla. From the corner store. The one who always gave him extra honey packets. Her eyes are wide, wet. She don’t say much. Just stands there, holding a thermos.

“Chamomile,” she says. “For the ache.”

He takes it. Hands shaking. The warmth seeps into his palms like forgiveness.

They sit. On the cold concrete. No words. Just sips.

And for the first time in months, Steven doesn’t feel alone on a Tuesday. The bruise is still there. But it pulses softer. Like maybe, just maybe, it’s healing.

He looks at the sky. It’s still gray. But there’s a sliver of light.

1pu4lb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1pu4lb1/former_multiunit_now_single_unit_owner_turned/,Former multi-unit (now single unit) owner turned builder. What would you want to see in a contractor recommendation packet?,"Long time lurker here on my alt account. I have spent most of my adult life behind an espresso machine (experienced in repairs of most big brand names, and one visit to Indiana away from being a certified Modbar tech...) and I am trying to run an idea by other owner/operators.

I am an engineer by training that ended up owning and operating a dozen coffee shops/food concepts over the years. Over time I downsized intentionally and now operate just one shop. The part I always enjoyed the most was not menu engineering or vendor calls or even dialing in shots, though I like to think I got pretty good at them. The part I enjoyed most was designing the spaces and then actually building them out. I liked the problem solving. I liked translating workflow into floor plans. I liked coordinating trades and watching an idea turn into a physical space people actually use.

A few years ago I started a design build company focused specifically on restaurants and coffee shops. Mostly small to mid sized operators. Lots of first time owners. Some multi unit folks who are tired of explaining why a three compartment sink location actually matters.

I am not here to pitch services. I am here because my roaster asked me to put together a package or document that they can share with their wholesale clients when those clients ask for builder recommendations. I want it to actually be useful and not feel like a glossy sales brochure.

Before I go too far down that road I wanted to ask this sub **what would actually be helpful to you if you were on the receiving end of something like this.** 

I will share what I am thinking of including and I would genuinely appreciate feedback additions or pushback. Comments, concerns, or cries of outrage.

* *Background -* I am thinking a short explanation of my background. Engineer turned operator turned builder. Not a resume dump. Just enough to explain why I understand both sides of the counter. As an owner you know how frustrating it is to work with someone who technically knows construction but does not understand service flow or health department realities. \*blah blah blah\* The goal here is to establish that I have lived through permitting delays, equipment lead times, and opening week chaos from the owner side and the builder side.
* *Portfolio -* A few of my own builds as case studies. I am thinking before and after with a short explanation of the problem and the solution. For example a shop where the original space had a weird column right where the bar wanted to be and how we reworked the line to keep bar flow clean. Or a tiny footprint where storage was the biggest constraint and how millwork decisions made or broke the operation. 
* *High Level Pricing -* I want to be honest about budgets and timelines at a high level. Not exact numbers but ranges and what drove them. I remember how useless it was as an early owner to see a beautiful space with zero context and hear numbers from GCs without getting into any details. Maybe a budget framework and an explanation of how costs typically break down in a coffee shop or small restaurant build. Rough percentages for demo/MEP/millwork/equipment/finishes. Where people tend to underestimate costs. Where there is flexibility and where there really is not. For example underestimating electrical upgrades or overinvesting in decorative finishes before the core infrastructure is solid. Again speaking from painful personal experience.
* *Realistic Timelines and Possible Roadblocks -* I am thinking a clear step by step explanation in plain language. Site evaluation. Concept and layout. Health department and building department coordination. Construction. Inspections. Punch list. Opening support. I want to call out common friction points. Landlords dragging their feet. Equipment taking longer than expected. Inspectors finding something no one anticipated. Not to scare people but to normalize the reality. I wish someone had walked me through some of those things when I was younger.
* *Roles/Responsibilities* \- Who does what. What the owner is responsible for. What my team handles. If you bring your own design professional, what they're responsible for. I cannot tell you how many arguments I have seen that come down to assumptions that were never explicitly stated. Who pulls permits. Who coordinates utility upgrades. Who installs owner furnished equipment. This section would be boring but I feel like more info is better than less.
* *References -* Instead of a hard call to action I am thinking something like if you want to talk to past clients or walk a finished space here are a few options. Or even encouraging people to talk to other owners who have gone through builds whether with me or not. The goal would be to inspire trust, and really not a hard sell here. I'm pretty confident that once a client talks to me they would trust me over any other GC in our market. 

If you were getting ready for a new build and asked your roaster for a recommendation, what would you actually read? What would you find useful? 

Appreciate any thoughts. Even if the feedback is this sounds useless do something else. ",1,1766522651.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False
1pu4kyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1pu4kyt/im_a_sheriffs_deputy_they_burned_the_scene/,"I'm a sheriff's deputy, They burned the scene.","
If you’re reading this, then either I finally lost my nerve… or someone decided it was safer if this got out.

I'm deputy Keller. I’ve been with the Madison County Sheriff’s Office just under six years. I knew Deputy Markham....the guy who responded to that Briar Hollow Road call back in February. We weren’t close, but we drank coffee out of the same pot. I remember how quiet he got afterward. How he stopped hunting. Stopped joking.

I didn’t believe his story.

Not really.

Until August.

It was a Friday night, hot and miserable, the kind where the woods hum with insects so loud it feels like static in your skull. Dispatch got a call just after midnight from a satellite phone, spotty signal, barely holding together.

A woman was crying, hyperventilating. She said they were camping near Red Elk Ridge, about six miles past the old fire road. She kept saying, “It took them...please, it took them,” over and over again.

Then the screaming started.

Not hers.

Something deepand bottomless. Like a freight train wrapped in rage.

The line went dead.

Search and rescue was paged. Fish & Wildlife too. I was first on scene because I was already patrolling the outer county roads.

By the time I reached the fire road, the temperature had dropped ten degrees. No wind, no birds, no insects.

Just silence.

I parked where the road gave out and proceeded on foot. Flashlight. Sidearm. Radio. Same drill we always follow, except my gut was telling me to turn around and wait.

The campsite was a quarter mile in.

I smelled it before I saw it.

Blood and pine sap. And something else...wet fur, like a dog left too long in the rain.

The tents were shredded, abosolutly ripped apart. The nylon peeled open like tissue paper. Coolers smashed. A cast-iron skillet bent nearly in half.

Then I found the first body.

Or what was left of him.

He’d been torn open from shoulder to hip. Bones crushed, like something had squeezed him until he came apart. I’d seen bear attacks. This wasn’t that. Bears don’t twist limbs completely around. Bears don’t stack bodies.

Yeah...

Stacked.

Three of them were piled near the tree line, broken like discarded toys. One woman was missing her lower jaw. Another camper, maybe early twenties....was wedged halfway up a tree, twenty feet off the ground.

Placed there.

I keyed my radio and called it in, my voice already shaking. Before dispatch could respond, I heard movement uphill.

Heavy movement.

Each step was deliberate and slow. The ground vibrated faintly under my boots.

Then came the smell again, stronger now.

And breathing.

Deep, controlled and intelligent.

I shut off my flashlight.

That’s when I saw it.

It stepped out from behind the trees like it had been waiting for me to notice. Ten feet tall, easy. Broad shoulders. Arms that hung nearly to its knees. Covered in dark, matted hair streaked with dried blood and pine needles.

Its face was… wrong.

Not a gorilla. Not a man.

A flat nose, heavy brow. Eyes set deepin it's massive skull, reflecting just enough moonlight to show awareness and some kind of recognition.

It looked at me like I was something it hadn’t decided to kill yet.

I raised my weapon.

It tilted its head, then it roared.

I fired. Twice. Center mass.

The rounds hit. I saw fur puff. Saw it's muscle flex.

It roared again then started walking towards me.

I ran.

I don’t remember making decisions—just moving. Branches slapped my face. My lungs burned. Behind me, trees cracked like gunshots as it followed, not rushing or panicked.
It's like it was herding me.

That’s when the lights came on.

Black vehicles rolled in from both sides of the ridge, no headlights at first, then sudden white floodlights that cut through the forest like daylight. Men poured out, dressed in black tactical gear with no insignia. Same kind Markham described.

One of them grabbed me and dragged me behind a truck.

“STAY DOWN, DEPUTY.”

“What the hell is that thing?” I yelled.

“TARGET ACQUIRED,” someone shouted.
“DO NOT LETHAL—REPEAT—DO NOT LETHAL.”

The creature charged the lights.

It moved faster than anything that big should. Soldiers fired—not bullets. Sonic pulses. Nets. Some kind of compressed air weapon that slammed into it like invisible fists.

It fought, holy shit, it fought.

It ripped one net clean apart, then threw a man thirty feet into a tree. But eventually, eventually...they brought it down. A reinforced harness cinched around its torso. Metal restraints clamped onto its limbs.

The creature roared one last time really fucking pissed off.

As they loaded it onto a flatbed transport, it locked eyes with me.

I don’t know how I know this, but I swear...it recognized me.

One of the black-clad troops approached me.

“This area is now restricted,” he said. “Official cause of death: animal attack. You will not discuss what you saw.”

“What is it?” I asked.

He hesitated.

Then said quietly, “Not the only one.”

They burned the campsite before dawn. Bodies were removed. Evidence erased. The official story hit the news by afternoon.

Mountain lion attack.

But here’s the part that keeps me awake:

Two weeks later, I was reviewing old county records. Unrelated work. Just killing time.

I found reports going back seventy years. Missing hunters, campers, entire families.

Always near Red Elk Ridge.

Always written off.

And always, always followed by a quiet visit from men who don't belong to any agency I’ve ever heard of.

Markham was right.

Whatever they’re capturing…

They’re not hunting them.

They’re managing them.

Somewhere along the way, many of my friendships naturally drifted and I’ve realised I don’t have many close connections at the moment, unfortunately my career has also played a major part in that. I am in a good place in life, but I have come to realise that community is indeed important and would like to meet new people in an intentional way. 

A little about me: I enjoy a balance of creativity and movement. On days I’ve had to myself, my hobbies simply consist of playing a round of golf or badminton. Horse riding, as I adore horses and was fortunate to have a horse to call my own, as a child. I also enjoy watching Formula One, even though I am not as familiar with cars, in the sense of what goes on inside of them. I often spend my quieter moments, reading, painting and creating purely for the pleasure of it. I’m especially fond of museums, specifically art museums, though I am happy wandering through any space that sparks my curiosity and learning new things. Going on adventures is immensely important. 

I also spend time volunteering when I am able to and adore animals (as I’ve already mentioned) apart from horses, I adore cats and ducks. I also considered myself a coffee connoisseur in the past, but I’ve recently found myself enjoying tea a lot more. If all goes well, Portugal will be my new home in the new year, so I am currently also learning the language. 

There’s a bit more to me, than I mentioned above, so if this resonates with you, I’d be immensely happy to connect with you. ",0,1766522548.0,MakeFriendsOver30,2,0.5,False

I’m running a modular techno setup and currently monitoring on Adam T5Vs. Recently I came across the Main Audio MA-MT 3.0 speakers (8” woofer, horn tweeter, passive, big cabinet) and I’m really drawn to the look and physical presence of them.

https://mainaudio.id/MT3.0-duplicate-764

They’re marketed more as hi-fi / space speakers (coffee shops, rooms, etc.) rather than studio monitors, specs are pretty minimal (30 Hz–20 kHz claimed, horn-loaded highs), and they need an external amp with EQ.

I’m trying to figure out whether switching to these instead of the T5Vs would make sense for a modular techno workflow, or if I’d be shooting myself in the foot accuracy-wise.

My thinking so far:
	•	Pros: big sound, physical low end, aggressive character, inspiring for jamming and performance
	•	Cons: passive, horn tweeter, no published response curve, likely very colored at nearfield distances

I’m not opposed to keeping the T5Vs for reference and using the MA-MT 3.0 as a secondary “vibe” system, but space/budget may force a choice.

Has anyone here:
	•	Used horn-based speakers with modular?
	•	Replaced nearfield monitors with hi-fi / PA-style speakers and regretted it (or loved it)?",1,1766522517.0,synthesizers,0,1.0,False

1pu4gg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pu4gg9/coffee_sugar_and_lies/,"Coffee, Sugar, and Lies","I don’t really know where it started, maybe the cruise, maybe before that. For 8 years my girlfriend and I, being the high school sweethearts we are,  have always had a great relationship. Hell, I was planning to propose once I finished grad school, but recently everything changed. 

I guess she was never really the same after her cruise, but I can't say for certain. Honestly I can’t even say for certain anything has changed, I feel like I am losing my mind. A few weeks ago my girlfriend, let's call her Alice, went on a dream vacation with some of her childhood friends. One of them got engaged and used the opportunity to have their dream cruise across the Caribbean. It was a 10 day cruise and I thought everything went great, but when Alice came home … I don’t know, things were just different. 

She texted me whenever the ship actually had a signal, just the little things to know she was thinking of me: texts that essentially boiled down to two things, that she loved and missed me, and that she can’t wait to finally shower in her shower.

Another piece of context, we have two showers in the apartment as it used to be a duplex. While we sleep and get ready in the master bedroom, Alice has all but taken over the spare bedroom’s bathroom as her own private paradise. 

With all of that said, I guess I should start from when she got home. About 3 weeks ago Alice came home unexpectedly. The cruise was supposed to end the following day, so I was shocked when she walked in the door. 

She gave me her radiant smile and after the initial shock of her random return, I felt my heart swell and push aside the anxieties. Looking back now, I swear that smile never touched her eyes, almost like she was approximating her own smile. 

“W .. What are you doing home?!” I stammered as I ran up and wrapped her in a tight embrace. 
“I guess we caught the current or something on our way back, we docked this morning” she offered with that steady, forced(?) smile. 

I wanted to ask why she didn’t call or have me pick her up from the airport, but the questions were drowned out by the roar of happiness I felt at seeing her after these 9 days. We spent the next hour or so in our room recounting her travels and all the drama that ensued. Besides the surface-level issues, it actually seemed like it was a fun trip. One of the last stories she told involved some drunk lady spilling her drink on Alice. 

I made some comment along the lines of “Well I know you’ve been craving your shower, at least you'll be able to fully get that stink off.” She paused, just for a heartbeat, when I mentioned showering, almost like she didn’t know what I meant. Then she smiled and said I was “so right” and then got up and proceeded to walk into our, not her, bathroom and begin showering. 

It may have been nothing, but it seemed like she genuinely didn’t even consider her own shower that she loved so much. I let it go and attributed it to jet-lag, not wanting to ruin the night, but the next few times she showered, it was in this same way. A few days after her return I finally asked if she had given up on her private paradise, and she seemed to have no idea what I was referring to saying she always bounced between both showers. 

However, the next time I noticed her showering, and every time after that, it came from “her” shower. Weird little inconsistencies like this have been more and more frequent lately. Nothing major, like forgetting names or meaningful memories, but many, many small issues. 

Take for example the fact that for as long as we have been together she has always taken her coffee with 1 sugar and 2 creams, and now all of a sudden she’s ordering it with 3 sugar and no cream. Maybe she started this on the cruise and I am overreacting, but these issues continue to compound. She’s always been one of the deranged few who wears socks to sleep, in fact we have a few inside jokes related to this, and now I am caressed by her cold, bare feet at night. 

It all came to a head earlier tonight when we went out for our anniversary dinner. She had wanted to plan the night and have it be a fun surprise for me. We went to a local place with a lot of meaning, it was where we had our first date. Despite all my anxieties around the strangeness, I was excited, not only because she actually remembered something real to us, but also because I desperately wanted the night to go well. 

Dinner was off to a great start, we enjoyed our bread and oil and talked about our plans for the weekend. I remember taking the time to just look and stare at her overt beauty, though our situation may have felt weird since the cruise, she was just as beautiful as ever. 

When she ordered a regular coke, my stomach churned with the fury of a storm made by Poseidon himself. Instantly, my mood soured and in that moment I was sure whatever was sitting across from me was not my girlfriend. In the last 8 years she has only ever ordered diet soda, and with this realization I began to panic. 

The past 3 weeks of oddities boiled up and manifested as sweat rolling waves down my face. Alice noticed something was off and offered to head back early, I agreed and made up some lie about moldy bread making me ill. 

The ride back was excruciating, she kept playing songs I knew she hated or had never heard of. She started asking about our friend Alex who we had not seen in a few months, mistakenly referring to him as her, as if she was just taking a guess based on the name. I had to sit there and pretend it was all fine, all the while I was positive I was sitting next to an impostor. I tried to keep my eyes forward, but I kept snatching glances at her. With each peek I felt the disguise melt more and more. 

She was trying to make small talk but her words sounded hollow, I heard them for what they were now. I got away with providing half-answers and blaming my illness, I just couldn't stand to look at her anymore. Her skin looked … tighter somehow, like the shape underneath wasn’t exactly right. I blinked hard forcefully causing the thought to pass. 

I could feel myself spiraling and somehow convinced myself that I was blowing things way out of proportion and that it was all just my misunderstanding. If I could just get home and sleep it off I’d feel normal again and I could convince myself that Alice was fine and so was I. 

When we got back to the apartment I followed her up the steps to our floor, and watched her begin unlocking the door. We have lived together in this apartment for 5 years, and during that entire time she always had trouble with unlocking the door. I found it so adorable and endearing, somehow she always not only struggled to get the key in the lock, but would then turn the key the wrong way first, every single time. 

I watched as she expertly slid the key into the lock and unlocked the door on the first turn, swinging the door inward. The hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up like the hackles of a wolf recognizing a predator approached. I could see the uncanniness in her eyes as they focused onto my fear. I didn’t even let her finish the question she had begun to ask, I turned and bolted out of the building. 

I ran until my legs cried out in pain and my lungs burned with every breath, each time I slowed down, all I could picture was that damn forced smile and stretched skin, then I’d take off spriting again. I don't know how long or how far I ran but I’m sitting now typing this on an unfamiliar bench in a dark park. My phone is full of messages from Alice feigning concern and asking what happened, but I will not be tricked again, no matter how well this creature can play Alice, it is not good enough to trick me.

getting laid off soon due to funding issues. i lucked out with this job and had it through networking, but my network is not very strong. it took about a year to get a job that's aligned with my experience.

also work in a creative field so it's competitive. i know what to do to work on my portfolio, network, etc. but... it's just so soul sucking. when you go to these networking events and job fairs, everybody wants a job. like, i'm not really ever sure why the recruiters are there. publicity?

networking is feels really tough too. obviously, a lot of ppl complain that it feels disingenuous. and i understand that. but, aside from that, it feels unrealistic. why would this random person give me a job? because i made a good first impression? because i took them to get coffee? why would they not recommend a friend or colleague of theirs over me?

i'm not even going to get into applying online. half of those postings are not even real. you waste so much damn time getting to like the last interview stage even.

it's hard for everyone. i'm feeling very daunted. i have a feeling i know that it's just not going to be ideal, it is very very unlikely to find a good full time job that i would actually like and care about like this one. i don't think that's being pessimistic, i think that's being realistic...

i don't know when i'm going to ever finally get a full time job where i'm doing work i care about. i also wonder if i should go the freelance route because of this. it's obviously really hard to get started with that but at least i wouldn't feel at the mercy of ai screening and recruiters.",1,1766522196.0,jobs,0,0.66,False

1pu47x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1pu47x9/on_call/,On call,"    I have been battling with mild insomnia for the last 5-10 years. For the most part I can keep it under control using thc, melatonin and for the worst nights zoplicone. 

   Once every two months I have so be on call for a week. I usually only get one or no after hours calls during my week. I have never had a call late or in the middle of the night, but there is always a possibility. The nights I’m on call I usually use melatonin and nothing else. I’m a trade worker so the job isn’t that critical but I do need to be able to drive if a call comes in. 

   My insomnia is very anxiety related, and unfortunately I get very anxious when I’m on call and it translates to not being able to sleep. I miss more days of work due to this than anything else. Often it’s the worry about not being able to sleep that makes me not be able to sleep

   Are there any sleep or anxiety meds that can be used short term that won’t cause severe impairment? I have read about Trazodone being used a sleep aid and an anti depressant. Is this something that can be used short term, like a week at a time? I’m assuming as an antidepressant it can be taken during the day and therefore doesn’t cause a severe impairment? 

    It would be extremely unlikely to get a call late at night. I wouldn’t be expected to leap out of bed and respond. I could take a bit of time to wake up, have some coffee and get out the door within an hour. I know ideally I shouldn’t be taking anything but I need to get this sorted out if I’m going to be successful in this career.

1pu45gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pu45gv/my_first_creepy_pasta/,My first Creepy Pasta,"I woke up feeling crappy from my late-night workout. My bones were stiff, so I decided to make coffee. The house seemed quiet and empty even though I’m the middle child of a family of five, and it was a Saturday morning. I looked at the clock on the stove: 10:00 a.m. 



Hmmm, everyone must be tired I thought, shrugging it off because they had had a bonfire the night before.



I pulled open the cabinet and started making coffee, not trying to be too quiet on account of it being late morning, and I wanted them to wake up. The Keurig hummed as it warmed the water. I started searching for breakfast food, settling on French toast. I started cooking.



A slight cough came from down the hall, where my siblings' rooms were. I let out tension I hadn’t realized I was holding, knowing I wasn’t totally alone, and continued on my food venture. My brother has been coughing frequently since he had asthma. This wasn’t like his regular dry cough…more *wet* and sickly. But I shrugged it off.  
  


After eating, I put a plate of food in the microwave for when the others woke and decided to shower. I heard the cough again, but this time it was accompanied by a whisper. The two came from my opposite ears. I assumed it was my brother coughing and my sister on FaceTime. Their rooms being at opposite ends of our hall made my theory suspect. I grabbed my towel and headed to the shower. Doing a little dance to calm my wack job nerves. 



The warm water hit my back as the bathroom steamed up. Call me crazy, but I love taking 30-minute, scalding-hot showers every day. Washing my hair took about 7 minutes because of the length and curls, and the rest of the time I just thought about things or sang to the music I played. I started my music and opened the curtain to grab the face wash I had misplaced. 



...The bathroom was strangely full of thick fog. Not the regular steam, more like a foggy morning blanket of clouds. I could barely see one foot in front of me. Getting weirded out, I turned the water down, hoping that would limit the smokiness. I felt around, noticing the fog to be extremely cold to the touch, and grabbed my face wash off the counter. 



I hated washing my face because it was the one time I had to keep my eyes closed for a long time in the shower. Not seeing my surroundings was a big fear of mine. Never knew what could happen, and watching creepy pastas had only solidified my fear. I wasn't a scary cat, but more paranoid than most.



I closed my eyes, trying to focus on the music, when I heard the bathroom door rattle. 



“Klair?” I called, assuming it was my sister.



I heard another cough in return. Must be my brother, I shrugged. But hearing the door rattle instead of twist was off-putting…Like he was trying to freak me out. I turned back to change the song I was hearing and ignore him.



The door then opened. I swore I locked it, though. Slowly opening my sud-covered eyes to see a prominent figure in the thick fog, I paused. The soap burned and I tried to scrub it out frantically, the image of the figure seared in the back of my eyelids.



My brother is 6’2”, but this didn’t have his mannerisms. It stumbled and fiddled with everything. Almost as if it were lost or searching for something. I, of course, had my eyes squinted so it could be a facade. But the thing kept gurgling and scraping around on the floor like it’s arms were too long. I let a noise slip from my mouth as I get the soap out quickly and my heart hammers in my chest. 



“Cody?”, I whisper.



 I could feel him looking at me. It was a bone-chilling feeling.  I washed the soap off quickly, barely able to see through the water on my long lashes, and I forced my eyes open to see the figure hunched over, looking under the bathmat in front of the sink. 



Shaking silently, I closed my eyes and speed ran, washing the conditioner from my hair. As I said before, I’m paranoid and was praying this was me being scared by my brother, who was searching through the foggy bathroom for his contacts. 



I heard a splash and rustle, and jumped mid-wash to open my eyes again.



A “thing” was looking at me between the cloth and transparent curtains of my shower, Face pressed against the fog-covered plastic held up by rings.  It was not my brother...



It had a face covered in sticky goo, and it coughed again, splattering orangish, thick juice onto the curtain. In horror, I watched its expressionless face, waiting for a creepy pedophile smile or something like in the stories I've heard of people getting kidnapped. 



It looked like a man, but it was burly in the torso, with a small head and long skinny limbs. Its eyes were sunken in and bloodshot with no colorful part...just white, almost like its eyes were backwards, and I was seeing the part that faced the skull.



I pushed it helplessly through the clear plastic, causing my hand to enter its chest cavity like it was made of slime. In horror, I retched my arm back out and yelled for my dad. 



“Dad! Shit, please come here!!”



It turned its head like a confused dog, tripped over the tall ceramic edge, and fell into the shower.  The slime gurgled in the filter as thick layers melted off its body.



I took that opportunity to run for it. Grabbing a towel, I haphazardly covered myself and ran to my brother's room. Where I had hoped I had heard the coughing previously that morning.



Slinging the door open, calling for him, I stopped. His room was covered in the crap of the beast… and he was sitting there wide-eyed and dismembered. His body parts were scattered across his bed and floor, each piece cocooned in the stuff that covered the monster. Orange thick syrup-like goo dripped on my brother's body..



I didn’t even realize the hot tears down my shocked face until they ran into my mouth. I covered my face trying to erase the visuals. I was glad I found him this way before my little sister saw it, I guess. I stumble blindly back into the hallway.



Slowly, I heard the whispering and coughing again. Terrified and shaking, I turned to see the thing on all fours coming at me. It looked confused that I would run away. Like, it didn’t understand why I was appalled. I tried to stay quiet, praying it was blind or deaf or something that would help me.



The whole house is filled with the fog that once hung over my bathroom. I pressed myself in the corner, connecting the dots of the morning.



The longer I looked it over, the more I realized its monstrous body was just random parts of people stuck together by orangish goo that seeped through its poorly attached ligaments, like a kid's art project where the glue drips through the paper. I noticed its hand….to see my mom's ring, and its left shoe was my sister's. Holy shit…It was an amalgam of my family's bodies.



Realizing my sister had to see this beast before she possibly died terribly, I threw up in my mouth, tears coming out of my face, clogging my vision.



No weapons or escape in sight. I slowly backed into my brother's room as it waltzed towards me. I knew punching it was futile, and my fist would be engulfed by its goo.  I stepped backward and heard a crunch.



I balled my fist and looked down to see I had carelessly stepped on my brother's unattached hand, breaking through the crystallized goo and shattering his fingers. 



“Is this a joke? A dream?” I cried recounting my sleep paralysis as a child, hoping I would wake up. 



I laughed, insanity striking me. No way out, I accepted death as the Frankenstein hobbled towards me. No remorse nor happiness in its stare. I kept laughing, realizing it had twisted its head sideways just like my dog. It had gotten her, too, probably.



 At least I won't be a suspect when the police find five dead in all of this mess. 



The thing finally got close to me, and the smell hit me so hard I doubled over vomiting. It reeked of burnt syrup. I stared into its backwards eyes, and the feeling of unconsciousness crept over me as I tried not to pass out. My fear overwhelmed me as the thing reached out and touched my shoulder with my mom's hand. Cold shivers ran down my body as  I crumbled to the floor, and the fear won over.

If u/That_Imagination_893 agrees, I am proposing that we all gather up and join him on his next adventure, the trip should go like this: 
1. A tour in one of the shadiest quartiers of centre ville, photoshooting every moment. At least 1 picture of a stray cat must be taken.
2. A tour inside marché central or some other market to have a hands-on perspective of inflation, a photo shoot of some fish or fruits and vegetables.
3. A coffee break in one of the lowest-budget cafés in a random area of centre ville.
4. A discussion with u/That_Imagination_893 about the inflated prices we saw at the market, which transitions to why Tunisia should  outsource the manufacturing of plastic bottles to Pakistan, and why waste water should be recycled to preserve our water reserves for future generations. Taking a picture of the table that clearly shows what we drank and the street outside the café.
5. We all go home happy after having an awesome adventure, an interesting multifaceted discussion, and the acquired skill of deciphering u/That_Imagination_893.

1pu42sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorsocietygujarat/comments/1pu42sv/smile_please/,"Smile, please!!","“Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality… “ 

Freddie Mercury’s A-Capella intro rang in Smit’s ears. This song had been his alarm tone since months. His eyelids still feel glued shut, under the effect of IV drug he had taken last night. For a moment he couldn’t tell if he was hallucinating being in Freddie’s concert, or it was just his phone waking him up, telling there’s “no escape from reality…”, “open your eyes, look up to the sky and seeeeeee…. ”  
 
 Finally his eyes cracked open. The morning light pouring through the half drawn curtains of his messy hostel room looked too bright, too sharp; as if someone had turned the contrast up on the world.  
 
The dirty handkerchief he used as a tourniquet while injecting the drug, was still loosely wrapped around his arm. The old Horlicks jar, in which he used to hide his drug vials, needles, syringes and cotton swabs, was lying beside him open. His temporary “escape from reality”.  
 
Like most of the addicts, as soon as he came to senses, he looked at his forearm where he injected the drug last night. What a mess it had become! Below the elbow fold, the skin was covered with tiny puncture marks. Veins looked like tiny blue worms sleeping beneath his skin. Some punctures had caused blood to leak out of veins, resulting in ugly patches beneath the puncture marks. 

Smit was thinking to cover his forearm with a big tattoo. He no longer needed to see the veins through his skin, to inject the drug (the medicine, if u ask him). With experience he had learned, that a vein better felt, was more reliable than a vein better seen. Like an expert phlebotomist, he palpated a big vein. The “bouncy “ feel was satisfying.  
He opened Pinterest on his phone, and once again started trying to select a tattoo design. He had been looking since a  week… skulls, serpents, daggers, spiders, bats,the devil, tombstones,hieroglyphs, crucifixe…, but he couldn’t connect to any.  
He put the phone in his pocket, got up, and for now, put on a long sleeve T-shirt to hide his forearm, before going to hostel canteen to get a cup of Tea. Tea was what he needed to clear his clouded senses.  
 
One of his hostelite friends pointed at him….  “Here comes the misnomer of our hostel…  Saale ka naam Smit hai, lekin kabhi smile karte nahi dekha.. ”He laughed as he said this, other friends joined him.  Smit gave his friends a fake smile, sat on the chair, and ordered a tea and a plate of poha.  
The friend continued… “sahi to bol raha hoon yaar…friends, have you heard about smile.jpg? The internet horror? No no.. Don’t search it on Google… it is a cursed picture of a scary dog. Whosoever stares at it gets his life ruined. My point is, sala wo kutta bhi smile kar leta hai, kyo ki pic ka naam smile.jpg hai.. Aur apna ye Smit? Smit ke chahere pe kabhi smit nahi dekha.” 
 
“Have you seen that picture? Did anything bad happen to you after seeing it? ”  another friend showed curiosity. He got reply.. “No Vro, no.. I couldn’t dare to…I just read it in some blog where the author had blurred it as sensitive content. ” 
 
Smit said, “Let me see it…I don’t believe in such superstitions. Moreover, how more can my life get cursed after all? ” and he unlocked his phone.  
 
(Smit also had a happy life, once upon a time. But he lost his parents in the Covid pandemic, along with most of their wealth. He himself survived, but the disease had permanently weakened his heart and lungs. Climbing 3-4 steps now felt like climbing a mountain, and watching an exciting cricket match sent sharp warning signals through his chest. After all this, his girlfriend also dumped him.) 
 
“abe, mat dekh, mat dekh….! Told you na, its cursed?! ”his friend panicked.. But it was too late. Smit had already Googled it and now was staring at it. And unlike most of the people who see it, he didn’t feel like closing the tab instantly… he felt something else… may be, recognition.  
 
A husky dog, sitting upright, with scary eyes and almost human teeth. Its mouth was stretched too wide, in a sinister smile. A smile, saying, that it knows what bad is going to happen to you, and that it is enjoying it.
 
Smit stared at the dog, and like that cliché but accurate quote of Nietzsche, the dog stared back. And for the first time, his scared friends saw, on Smit’s face, a smile, nay, a grin, that wasn’t fake.
 
“Found it! My tattoo!! ” Smit thought. “Like Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian Death-God, this Dog will protect my secret.” 
  


                      ******


That evening, Smit was sitting at Lucky’s little tattoo parlor. First he looked at Smit’s forearm. “So, a cover-up, eh? ”said  Lucky  while lighting a “Gold Flake”. He took a deep puff and looked at the image. He said, “Man, this looks cursed…!”   
“That’s the point.” Smit replied.
 
Lucky put his hand on Smit’s shoulder and said “You know why they call them permanent tattoos? Even when the skin, the flesh or even people  aren’t permanent? Even when these tattoos can be erased by lasers nowadays? Because they are engraved not only on the skin, but also on the soul.. and soul is eternal. So, tell me brother, are you sure about this? ” Smit didn’t say anything. He simply took out the decided amount from his pocket as crumpled 500 & 200 rupees notes and put it on Lucky’s table, and sat on the recliner chair, his right arm resting on the armrest.  
Lucky reckoned the client was determined. He sketched the image on Smit’s forearm. Then he took out his tattoo machine, and then his “professional secret”, his homemade tattoo ink. He had wandered tribal areas of Gujarat and M.P., learning which components the tribal people use to give the tattoo a unique look, and to keep it from fading. Tiny eggs of some perticular insects, soot collected from the flame of “shuddh Ghee ka diya” with a small inverted katori, iron powder and what not!  
 
Lucky loaded the 15cm long needle in the tattoo machine, smiled and said, don’t be scared, only a couple of millimeters will pierce your skin. Smit gave his typical fake smile. Needles have been his friends. Now needle pricks didn’t give him pain, but an Endorphin high. 
 
Lucky cracked his knuckles, said to the speaker “Alexa, play Sadho Re by Agnee ”, and started his work.  
 
The needle buzzed like an angry hornet, but the screeching of Guitars, pounding of Drumbeats, the lyrics and the cigarette smoke took away whatever little pain it was causing to Smit.  The infamous Dog, gradually started “getting under his skin”,of course, in a different way than its previous victims.  

                          *****
 
A month later, Smit is sitting in the cabin of his physician, also an old friend of his late father. There was weakness in his left arm and leg since he got up. The doctor examined him and said tenderly “Son, how many times I told you to stop taking that poison? Your heart condition already puts you in a high risk of Stroke, and your addiction multiplies that risk. Let’s not waste any time, and get an MRI done.”  


                        *****


At the Imaging Center, the technician asked him to take away all the metal he had on him. His belt, watch, chain, keys, wallet and phone. He was asked to remove his clothes and put on a hospital gown with no zippers or buttons. The technician also confirmed that he had no metal implants, dental or orthopedic, in his body. He wondered why they were so strict about metals.  
 
He also saw the warning sign outside the MRI console room warning against metal objects. 
 
He learned that the MRI machine is basically a huge and strong electromagnet. And anything that may get attracted by it becomes a lethal projectile, which can harm a person or the machine itself.  
 
He was made to lie on MRI machine’s platform, and some foam paddings and velcro straps were applied around his head to keep it steady. Then the platform slid into the white tunnel of the machine.  “Mr Smit, now don’t move and lie still. Just half and hour, and we are done! ”.. The technician’s cheerful voice crackled through the intercom. The machine came to life and started its mechanical heartbeats  “tak-tak-tak-tak” 
 
He felt something in his tattoo, he wasn’t sure what. The microscopic iron filings in his tattoo ink were responding to the call of the mother magnet. A slow, rolling warmth over the skin of his forearm, and a feeling of tiny ants slowly crawling under his skin. “Are you ok, Mr Smit? ”,asked the technician through intercom. “Umm… I’m fine.. ” lied Smit,still unaware of what was going to happen. 
 
“tak-Tak-TAk-TAK-TAK-TAK-TAK…. ” the beats got louder, and the skin over his tattoo lifted for a millimeter. Just like a bedsheet covering iron beads lifts when you hover  a magnet over it. Smit gasped with pain. The tiny iron filings beneath his skin started lining up, following the invisible magnetic field, just like an army, and then they started marching towards the surface of the skin.
 
Now Smit tried to shout, but the next sequence of MRI hit harder. All he could do was to clench his teeth and fists hard. The dog’s eyebrows frowned, its nose flared as if it could smell his fear. This happened because the density of the ink was the highest in eyebrows and nose, and the particles were pooling, migrating, and were trying to tear free as a solid image of the dog. He felt palpitations, started sweating in the chilly MRI room. He gathered all his strength and screamed… “Stop the scan!!”… But the technician had gone out to grab a cup of coffee.  
 
This one was a powerful 3.0 Tesla MRI machine, much stronger than its 1.5 Tesla predecessors. It started singing at its full strength, like the operatic crescendo of Bohemian Rhapsody…  Smit screamed “Let me go….!! ”, and he imagined the machine shouting “NO!  We will not let you go!! ”… 
 
Again  “LET ME GO…!! ” 
 
“WE WILL NOT LET YOU GO!! ” 
 
Smit’s heart was fluttering like a scared bird in his rib cage, and he realized. “Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me…!” and that devil was tattooed on his forearm. And thin streaks of blood were now flowing through the dog’s eyes and mouth, from tiny tears in his skin.  
 
As the MRI sequence progressed, the iron filings started oscillating and heating up with friction. Smit’s skin started burning from inside. The pain, the stretching, the burning, all of it became unbearable. This torture acted like a whip to a moribund horse, to his already debilitated heart. Its contractions started becoming faster, arrhythmic and weaker.  

Smit smelled burning flesh and hot iron. He couldn’t move his head, as it was strapped to the platform. So he lifted his arm, and squinted at it with eyes wide open with fear.  In the dim light, he saw the dog’s bloody smile for a fraction of second, and then the tattoo detonated off his arm, and slapped wetly against the white bore of the machine, like a flying bat sticking to the ceiling of a cave. This was the final blow. His exhausted failing heart convulsed like a dying bird that had beaten itself to shreds against the rib cage, and then it stopped beating. His eyes froze first in terror, and then in death.
 
“Damn..! I told you not to move, Mr Smit! All the sequences are ruined! ” the technician entered after few minutes, sipping coffee from a paper cup. He pressed the button and slid the platform out, and the cup fell from his hand. 
  

                        *****

 
AFTER A MONTH 
 
Dr Ravi, the renowned radiologist, was sitting in his cabin, tired. It had been a hectic week for him. It was almost midnight, and he had just finished reporting the CT scan of an unlucky patient named Lucky. Poor guy, a tattoo artist, had stumbled while drunk, on a glass full of tattoo needles kept upright. Three out of those needles were still stuck in his eyeball.

 The doctor was exhausted. He needed to sleep, but the tattoo needles had reminded him about an unfinished task. He had to give final touch to his PowerPoint presentation. After two days, he was presenting Smit’s case in a National level conference of radiology at Delhi. After all, it was a rare complication of MRI, and rarest of rare cause of death. It was titled “MRI-Induced Adverse Effects in Ferrous-Based Tattoo inks: A Prospective Study of Thermal Injury & its clinical consequences.” 
 
The slides contained some physics diagrams about magnetism, Smit’s case papers, postmortem pictures of his exploded forearm, autopsy report and pages from some other research papers. “It is still incomplete without the slide showing the original tattoo.” thought Dr Ravi, yawning. 

An idea crossed his mind. He grabbed his phone opened Instagram to search Smit’s account, thinking, “This generation posts everything on Insta! He must have uploaded a pic of the tattoo!!” Then he locked his phone, thinking again, “but… will this be ethical?!” He stared at the blank screen for a while, then again unlocked it, and found Smit’s profile. And lo and behold, there it was! The dog was smiling at him. The doctor smiled back, saying “Found you! We’re going to Delhi!!” 

As he took a screenshot, for a moment he felt the beast winked at him!

1/3 NL, a few nights ago. I’ve been grinding since before this kid was born. Coffee’s hot, stack is healthy, life is good.

Couple of limpers. Some 25-year-old hoodie warrior opens to $18. Kid’s been sitting there for hours, wearing big-ass headphones, staring at his phone between hands, hasn’t made top pair since the Nixon administration. 

Now listen, I don’t get fancy. I don’t do solver nonsense. I play *real poker*. So I bump it to $60 as God intended.

Kid decides he’s gonna “apply pressure” and 4-bets to $150. Cute. Real cute. I give him the full five-second Hollywood tank (you know the one) and then calmly ship $800 effective right into his soul. No speech. No shaking hands. Just confidence.

This kid goes into the longest tank of his life. I can *see* him replaying every podcast, every YouTube short, every Reddit comment about “OMC's only have Aces.”

Finally… he does it.

He folds Kings.   Face.   Up.

The whole table loses it. One guy even proudly announces he folded AK earlier, like that’s an accomplishment. Kid’s trying to get laughs, vibes, Christmas spirit,  whatever helps him sleep. I just say, “Well… I had a good hand.” (No show. Ever.)

1pu40if,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pu40if/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_mom_didnt_celebrate/,AITA for being upset that my mom didn’t celebrate my birthday that well?,"I (20F) just had my birthday yesterday. I had plans beforehand (like I do every year since I was 17) to see a movie and get dinner with my friends, which had been set about a week ago. A few days ago, my mom was obviously upset by this, and she asked why I wasn’t spending the night with my family (2 uncles, and an aunt), and I responded that I had these plans set in advance, but I was happy to move them since my friends have flexible schedules. She told me it was fine to spend time with my friends, and so I treated it as such. 

Later, she asks why I didn’t want to spend my birthday with my family. Repeat the same offer to move friend plans and same denial to do so. I told her (albeit a bit frustrated) that to me it wasn’t a big deal on what exact day I celebrated my birthday, if I wanted to spend it later with my friends I could, and I could do it with my family on the exact day. She declined again and said “it was my day and I could do what I wanted,” but “if I was in my college town (out of state) it would be okay to spend my 20th with my friends, but I’m back home so I should want to spend it with my family.” Repeat loop.

My birthday came up, and in the morning, she told me happy birthday. The day before, she gave me my gift of pajama pants and socks with my cat’s face on it. Super cute, I think it was a sweet gesture, but that was it. At the risk of sounding like a prick, it didn’t feel genuine or like it was enough. I need to mention that my mom has mentioned multiple times that this year was the year she’s made the most money she’s ever made before any assumptions are made. I feel like it’s okay to be a little disappointed with only receiving socks and pants that were a total of 11 bucks, knowing that she’s been ordering smaller bags for herself and treating other people on their birthdays incredibly well. While the gift itself is sweet and I do like it, it doesn’t feel like a genuine gift that shows care. 

The entire day, she was just acting like she was annoyed with my existence. I had a doctor’s appointment set on that day, and on the way back I brought her coffee, and she said “Oh. Thanks. This isn’t what you usually get me though.” (It was) As I was leaving to meet with my friends, she was on call with her friends who said that “birthdays were for moms too!” and that today they’d be celebrating her. It was on speaker and she knows I can hear her through the house, so I was a bit taken aback by this, but I just brushed it off because I wanted to have a good time. 

I feel like she could’ve done more to at least try and celebrate my birthday and tried to act like she wasn’t just annoyed with a decision that I made that she told me over and over that it was okay. I understand that she would be upset over me not spending it with my family, but I told her over and over my friends have a flexible schedule and it could be any other time, and we could do a birthday thing with my family now.

My fork hit the plate with a loud clank. I slowly finished chewing my bite, swallowed hard, and then uttered, 

""What?""

*Fuck.* The scale. The one that stuck to the wall in the bathroom when I flung it. I'd forgotten to pick it up. My throat tightened. 

""I know it must have freaked you out. But, they're for a model I've been working on.""

""A *model?* John... they felt *real.*”

""Well, thanks!"" he chuckled. ""I'm trying to make them as lifelike as possible.""

I was still extremely skeptical. 

""Why were they in your shaving kit, though?""

""They weren't finished curing, and I didn't want them to get messed up. So, I just tucked them into there.""

It seemed like a strange choice to me, but conceivable, I suppose. John was a very smart man, though sometimes his logic and reasoning on certain things differed drastically from my own. Maybe he thought doing that would protect them from dust particles or something. But I had more questions, and I decided to just go for it now that the lines of communication had been opened. 

""*Okay...* well, what about the salt?""

""The salt?"" he asked, raising an eyebrow. 

I chose my words carefully. 

""Yes. When I kissed you the other day, your skin tasted salty. And, the cinnamon rolls you made? They were covered in salt. I had to throw them all away.""

He paused for a moment, took a deep breath, then looked down at his plate. 

""I sweat a lot, Sonia. You know I've been working out more lately, too. I got up extra early and went for a run before I made those. *God,* I'm embarrassed now."" 

""So, what about last night in bed? Are you going to try to tell me *that* was just sweat, too?""

My heart flopped in my chest as soon as the words had left my mouth. He looked back up at me, and his eyes softened.

""*Yes...* I was having a nightmare. *Oh, Sonia,* it was awful. And it felt so real.""

""Wait, wait, I don't understand,"" I said, scrunching my eyebrows at him. ""Why did you say you were wet from the shower, then?""

""Because that's what happened in my dream. I was being drowned in the bathtub by some unseen force.""

He broke his gaze from me to turn and set his plate down on the coffee table in front of us before continuing. 

""Whatever it was, I couldn't see it; I could only feel it. All I really remember is that I was lying in the bathtub, unable to move, while it held my face down under the shower head. So, when I woke up drenched and struggling to breathe, I thought it had really happened—that I'd somehow escaped and reached the bed. I tried to wake you up to help me, but... you freaked out. And I was still so disoriented. It didn't hit me that it was just a dream until you said I was scaring you. By then, you were so upset all I could do was say sorry and go sleep on the couch. But that's why I got off work early today. I wanted to make your favorite dish and apologize.""

He reached out his hand and gently grabbed ahold of mine. It all seemed so bizarre. But, at the same time, just plausible enough to stop me in my tracks and force me to recalibrate. I didn't understand how a person could possibly sweat that much, though. I mean, I know hyperhidrosis is a thing, but I had no idea that it could present to such a degree. Or, maybe he actually *had* started sleepwalking and almost drowned himself. Either way, I felt bad. I realized I'd been so stuck in my own head that whole time. I hadn't even considered how *he* might have been feeling. 

Flipping around the perspective, it would actually be *me* who looked like the irrational one. Throwing away the apology cinnamon rolls and crumpling up the note, screaming at him in bed and acting like he was a monster, sneaking around and collecting model fish scales to have them tested... *God.* No wonder they couldn't be identified. I felt absolutely ridiculous.

He went on to tell me he'd just been really stressed about this new project at work. Evidently, it was making him irritable and manifesting itself in other strange ways, too. I accepted his apology and his explanations, then told him I was sorry, too, for how I'd reacted to things. We finished our meal and the episode of Deadliest Catch in silence. Then, John took my plate and told me not to worry about the dishes; he'd have them washed and put away by the time I got out of the shower. 

The bathroom was spotless. His shaving kit wasn't out, and the tub looked pristine, like it had been scrubbed clean and polished. It looked better than it did when we moved in. I smiled. It seemed like he was truly making a concerted effort to set things right between us.

As I exited the bathroom in my robe, he came running down the hallway like a toddler, gleefully shouting,

""My turn!!""

I chuckled and rolled my eyes, then went off to bed to wait for him. He stayed in the bathroom showering for a long time; the sound of running water felt endless. When he finally emerged, he immediately crawled into bed with me and scooted his body close to mine, putting his arm around me and pulling me into an embrace. He was warm again. He felt like *John* again. I closed my eyes as he leaned in and whispered,

""I love you, Sonia.""

I told him I loved him, too. He gently kissed my cheek, then asked,

""You wanna *spawn?*"" 

My eyes popped open, and I slowly turned my face to see his big, cheesy smile looming over me. I let out a weak, nervous laugh, and he winked. It was just a joke, albeit a poorly timed one. But still on par with John's typical goofy sense of humor, I thought. The tension in my body began to fade away as he started running his hands softly across my skin. We made love passionately that night. It felt the way it did when we had first gotten together, like all the magic between us was still very much alive. I peacefully drifted off to sleep in his arms, with my mind finally at ease. 

For a while, it truly seemed like I had gotten him back. The more normal he acted, the more I convinced myself I'd just been overreacting that entire time. No more yelling or violent outbursts.  On the contrary, he seemed to be in a great mood all the time. The John from our college years suddenly seemed to resurface—the version that had won me over. He was kind, so affectionate, and more attentive than he'd been in years. It felt like he was courting me all over again. 

Because of this, I doubted my own judgment and perception. I swallowed all of my suspicions and stopped digging around and asking questions. I ignored the faint scent of putrid decay coming from the bathroom, telling myself it must be an issue with our septic system. I lathered tons of lotion on my increasingly drying skin and chalked it up to winter. But the most foolish thing I did? I allowed my heart to lure my mind into believing the thing I wanted so desperately to be true. 

By the next week, I'd almost forgotten about the whole thing. Then, one morning, everything changed. We were at the front door, grabbing our things from the coat closet and getting ready to leave for work. I looked down and caught a glimpse of something odd. Something that didn't belong. Something *fishy*. Lying just within view, sitting inconspicuously on the sole of his shoe, was a single strand of seaweed.

As I quickly inspected it, my heart sank. *No...* It wasn't one of those dried seaweed snacks they sell at the Asian market. It looked slimy and wet—like it had just been dragged up from the water. Portions of the roots were still attached. I only had about a half-second to process this information before he shoved his foot into the loafer. *Fuck.*

He walked me to my car and kissed me goodbye. With clenched teeth, I forced a smile and drove away, looking at him through my rearview mirror. He stood there in the driveway and watched my car until I began to turn left at the stop sign at the end of our street. As soon as I was out of his sight, I punched hard on the gas. 

*God dammit,* I thought, slamming my hand onto the top of the steering wheel. *Why?* Why did I have to see that? Why did it have to be there?? Things had finally started to feel normal again, and now this? *What the fuck?!* I drove to work in a silent state of panic, desperately trying to stop myself from spiraling. 

It's just a piece of seaweed, I told myself. It meant nothing. He could have been doing field research for the lab. *Hell,* there could be several perfectly rational explanations as to how it had gotten there. I mean, he was a marine biologist, and we lived in Bar Harbor, for Christ's sake. The ocean was five minutes from everywhere. It's not like seaweed was an uncommon thing to see around Maine. With as far as the tides drew back at the bay, it was practically expected. 

Things between us had been going so perfectly... better than they'd been in a while, actually. I couldn't let this one little strange sighting ruin all of that. I forced it to the back of my mind and tried to focus on my job. I had a report to finish on fishery management and my boss was asking for progress updates daily. As the day went on, though, my mind began to wander. During my lunch break, I started googling. 

*Symptoms of psychosis:*
-Hallucinations
-Delusions
-Confused and disturbed thoughts. 

Okay, *shit.* That sounded like it could possibly apply to me as much as it did to him. If I'm being honest, I wasn't entirely sure what was real and what I'd just been imagining. At that point, the only thing I was sure of was that either John was losing his mind or I was. I can confirm that I was definitely experiencing the *'confused and disturbed thoughts'* part, though. 

*Symptoms of a brain tumor:*
-Headaches
-Seizures
-Changes in mental function, mood, or personality. 

*Hmm...* That last symptom hit a little too close to home. I bit down on my bottom lip and hit the backspace button. Trying to diagnose him using WebMD would be impossible. It would also serve to further my paranoia, which was the last thing I needed at the time. I'd just have to keep watching him to see if any more symptoms appeared. 

I dug around in my Greek salad, chasing a Kalamata olive with my fork, when a thought came to me. I typed *'marine hatchetfish'* into the search bar. Living in depths of up to 4,000 feet, they looked about how you'd expect. Hideous little things with enormous bulging eyes, a downturned gaping mouth full of tiny sharp teeth, and a grotesquely misshaped body. I remember thinking how terrifying these creatures would be if they weren't small enough to fit inside a human palm.  

Its scales were silver and reflective, just like John's model scales looked. If John was making a model, why would he choose such an ugly specimen? Let alone one belonging to a genus that wasn't even remotely in his realm of studies. I suppose he could have taken a personal interest in this particular fish, but I still didn't understand why. So, I kept reading.

There are seven documented species of Argyropelegcus, otherwise known as silver hatchetfish. Each species differs slightly in size and range, but they all share a few common traits. They feed on prey like small crustaceans, shrimp, and fish larvae, which they hunt by migrating to the surface at night. They utilize their disproportionately large pupils to detect even the faintest traces of light. And, like many deep-sea fish, they possess bioluminescence. A set of tiny blue, glowing lights emitting from their underbellies act to mimic rippling sunlight, concealing them from predators below: a nifty little evolutionary trick referred to as counter-illumination. 

Not exactly groundbreaking stuff. But, I suppose I could see why John might have taken an interest in them. He'd always been particularly fascinated with bioluminescence, after all. I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find a biologist who didn't at least agree that it was one of the most amazing natural phenomena to grace our planet. Maybe he was planning to attach tiny LED lights to his model. With it being almost December, maybe he'd been working on this as a Christmas gift for a colleague. Or, perhaps even an ornament for our tree? I hoped.

I slid my phone into my pocket and went back to work, determined to finish my report. At the very least, I needed to complete the first draft of it. I couldn't afford to let myself go overboard with obsessive thoughts over what was going on in John's mind. I had my own career to focus on... my *own* damn life to live, too, you know? I was able to power through the conclusion of my report by the end of that afternoon. Not my best work, I'll admit, but it was something to show my boss the next day.

John's vehicle was already in the driveway when I got home. I glanced over and noticed that the gate to the backyard was open, and the hose was trailing around the corner of the house from the front spigot. But I didn't think much of it at that moment. I walked inside and saw his field bag lying on the floor in front of the coat closet. None of the lights had been turned on, and the TV was off. 

""John?"" 

No answer. I set my bag down on the floor next to his, then made my way to the kitchen. His keys and pocket change were sitting atop the island, but other than that, the room was exactly as we'd left it that morning. I thought back to the hose. Maybe he's gardening out in the backyard? Wait, in mid-November? *No, Sonia—get it together!* My persistent urge to explain away odd behaviors in order to maintain the status quo had begun to seriously damage my inductive reasoning skills. 

My search for him had to be put on pause, however, at the request of my bladder. I shuffled to the bathroom, flipped on the light, and hurried to the toilet to relieve myself. I flushed, washed my hands, then shut off the faucet. When I did, I could suddenly hear a drip coming from the bathtub. But it wasn't the *'plop'* sound that water makes when it hits a dry surface. It was the *'plunk... plunk... plunk...'* you hear when it's dripping into more water below. 

My blood ran cold, and my hand began to tremble as I slowly reached out toward the shower curtain. I quickly forced in a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Then, I ripped the curtain back. There was John. He was just lying there, fully submerged and motionless, eyes closed and arms folded across his chest. Large chunks of ice floated in the water surrounding his body. My heart stopped. I fell to my knees, screamed his name, and threw my arms out to grab him from the water. Then... his eyes popped open.

His pupils were two enormous pools of blackness, covering almost the entire diameter of his iris. For a second, I froze; he was looking at me so intensely that it felt like his gaze directly pierced into the depths of my soul. Then, he blinked, releasing me from his trance. I fell backward and immediately started scrambling to secure a foothold on the fuzzy mat beneath me. As I tried desperately to stand back up, John's body began to slowly rise from the water. He then turned his face to look at me, and the corners of his mouth started to recede into a smile before he uttered,

""Hey, Sonia! Did I scare you?""

I blinked a few times, mouth hanging open like a bass, completely dumbfounded by the audacity of this question. I took a few seconds to catch my breath while I stared at him. Then, the visceral reaction I'd internalized suddenly bubbled over and erupted to the surface. 

""*JOHN!!!*"" I shrieked, and my voice began to break. ""I thought you were fucking *DEAD!!*""

He laughed. 

""Oh, wow, Sonia! That's dramatic. I'm just doing a cold plunge!""

I rose to my feet, still in shock and trying to choke back the tears that had begun to flood my eyes. 

""...*What?!*""

He stepped out of the tub and began toweling himself off. 

""A cold plunge! Howard from work told me it would help me go harder on my workouts. It actually feels great; you should try it!"" he said. 

""*Fully clothed?!*"" 

""Well, yeah, Sonia... that's how you do it. You don't get naked like it's a regular bath,"" he giggled. 

I just stood there, staring at him blankly until that stupid smile had left his face. 

""Are you okay?"" he finally asked. ""Jeez, I had no idea that it would actually frighten you. I'm sorry.""

I wasn't sure if I believed him or not, but that wasn't my focus at the time. There was an intense rage simmering inside of me. I wanted to scream and cry and beat my fists against his chest. How could he be so dismissive? So callus? But I knew at that moment trying to convey those feelings to him would do no good. Neither would it be to continue to question him. 

""It's fine,"" I said. 

It most certainly was not fine, but I didn't want him to think otherwise. The panic hadn't yet left my body, and with it came a type of calculated behavior I can only attribute to pure survival instinct. I allowed him to think I'd gotten over it and started dinner. 

It was a Tuesday, so I was making tacos. Cliché, I know. But it was just one of my things. After he'd dried himself off and changed clothes, he came into the kitchen and sat down at the island. I didn't turn around to look at him; I just kept stirring the ground beef in the pan. 

""You know,"" he said, ""I've been craving seafood lately."" 

I froze in place, gripping tightly onto the wooden spoon. 

""Maybe next Tuesday we can have fish tacos. Or later this week, we could try shrimp scampi?"" he continued.

It took everything in me not to react, but I resumed stirring and replied,

""Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I can look up some recipes."" 

John had never asked for seafood before. He'd eat it if offered, but it was never one of his favorites. Was he testing me? If so, I hoped I passed. We ate, watched TV, and then I went to the bathroom to shower. This was my chance. I turned on the faucet in the bathtub, locked the door, and then went straight for his shaving kit on the counter. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest as I unzipped the kit, being extremely careful not to disturb whatever contents were concealed inside. And yes, I found exactly what I feared I'd find. More scales. A lot of them. Silvery, delicate, but this time... dried. And horrifyingly, they were speckled with tiny red drops of what looked like blood. I leaned in closer and pulled out my phone to start taking pictures. When I zoomed in, I noticed that attached to the inner edge of each scale was a half-ring of beige-colored tissue. Flesh. It was *human* flesh. 

*Motherfucker.* I dropped my phone and gripped the counter to steady myself, but the room was already spinning. I had to keep breathing... I had to move... I had to turn off the water. I ran over to the bathtub and shut it off right before it overflowed. Dark spots began to appear in my line of vision, and the blood drained from my face as an overwhelming wave of dizziness swept over my body. Fearing I was going to pass out, I lowered myself down onto the floor beside the tub and focused on the ripples in the water, trying to ground myself. 

The mystery white sediment had come back, lining every corner and crack of the tub. Little chunks of it were floating all over the surface. *What the hell?* How could it have come back so quickly? And so much?? I reached out and plucked the nearest chunk from the water. It was soft and started to crumble at the edges. Then, without thinking, I lifted it to my mouth and tasted it. *Salt.*

My world felt as if it were closing in on me. It didn't matter how many times my mind repeated the word *'no'*, the facts remained. I couldn't wish this away. I felt broken and completely lost. There was nothing I could do except to try to go through the motions of the rest of the night. I bathed, got dressed, went to bed, and pretended to be asleep. 

It took about an hour for him to crawl into bed next to me, then another to confirm he was sleeping. As soon as he started snoring, I rolled over in bed to face him, then lifted the covers and looked down at his body. *I need to check,* I thought. Holding my breath, I reached out and gently lifted the back of his shirt, disrupting his breathing pattern and causing him to shift slightly. I let go but scooted closer. Being caught inspecting his body that way would throw up alarms that I was onto him, but using my hands to do it under the ruse of cuddling wouldn't, I thought. 

I put my arm around him, resting it on his side. He didn't react, so I slid my hand underneath his shirt and slowly moved it around his back, searching for any anomaly. His skin was ice cold again and clammy. Almost *rubbery*. Other than that, I didn't feel anything else strange. So, I slowly moved down to his hip. When I got there, I froze. Something instantly felt wrong. Like, *very* wrong. 

His pelvic bone seemed to have somehow shifted from its natural upright position to tilting *downward.* My eyes widened, but I slowly resumed my inspection. As I began to run my fingers under the line of his boxers in disbelief, something hard and sharp protruding from his tailbone pricked the tip of my index finger. I ripped my hand away and instantly brought it to my mouth to stop the bleeding. When I did, my finger tasted like brine. I quickly turned back over to face my alarm clock. 

That night, as I lay in bed next to him, I didn't sleep. Instead, I resumed my endless loop of thoughts. And, in those thoughts, I finally stumbled upon a tiny speck of clarity drifting within a sea of confusion. I couldn't continue to live in this little fantasy land, pretending everything was perfect no matter how much I wanted to. What I needed was to be logical. I needed to look at this from a scientific perspective. 

Step one: form a theory. *I think my husband is a fucking fish person.* 
Step two: collect evidence in hopes of disproving said theory.

At exactly 4:44 AM, John stopped snoring. I shut my eyes tightly and waited as he got up and went to the bathroom. He spent about twenty minutes in there, doing God knows what, then immediately left the house. When I heard his engine start out front, I shot up and ran to the window. Then, I watched his headlights trail down the street until he got to the stop sign. He didn't take a left into town. Instead, he took a right, headed toward the ocean. 

I ran to the front door, grabbed my keys and a coat, and then shoved my feet into the first pair of shoes I could find. The harsh, cold night air hit me like a steamship, nearly knocking me over. I pulled the hood up over my head and scurried to my car, then tore down Hancock Street after him. A rush of adrenaline began surging through my body as I got closer and closer to the coast. Squinting through the darkness of the deserted street, I looked around in all directions, frantically trying to locate his vehicle. Then, I spotted it parked just outside the house of a local artist. 

The Shore Path ahead was closed for the winter, so I turned down Devilstone Way, made a U-turn to face the end of the road, and cut my lights off. Although the thought crossed my mind, my gut told me that he wasn't inside that house. I got out of my car, leaving it running, and started walking toward the bay. I ducked down under the large *'BEACH CLOSED'* sign and continued until I was a few feet away from the rocky coastline. And there he was. The dark silhouette of my husband... standing still at the water's edge, staring directly out into the abyss, and completely nude. 

My heart began thrashing against my chest like a fish caught in a net. On his lower back, a small, spiny dorsal fin glimmered in the moonlight. His legs were completely covered in silver scales from the knees down. Then, he began to turn his body in my direction, revealing the full extent of his pelvic deformity. I quickly lowered myself behind a large rock and watched on in horror through the fog as he turned back around and slowly began walking—straight into the fucking ocean. 

I stood there, paralyzed with terror, as his head slowly sunk below the surface. Only a few breathless moments passed before he suddenly breached while biting down hard on a lobster. It thrashed and squirmed within the confines of his jaws until he'd separated the tail from the body. *Holy fuck.* My mind was unable to process what I was truly witnessing.

Instinct took over, and my hand shot up, covering my mouth to stifle my scream. I turned around and ran full speed back to my car. I didn't look behind me; I was too afraid. I just kept running and praying to God that he hadn't seen me. I threw the car in drive and booked it home, knowing he would be making his way back there any minute now that he'd had his... *breakfast.* I gagged, but I didn't have the time to be squeamish. The clock was ticking. I had to come up with a plan and fast. *Shit,* why couldn't I have married a nice boring accountant?!

When I got back inside the house, I slammed the door shut and looked down at John's field bag sitting on the floor next to the coat closet. I knew I only had seconds to spare, so I went straight for the side pocket where I knew he kept his flash drives. It was the only chance I had to find out exactly what I was dealing with here. I reached inside and dug around. *Yes!* My fingers met one just as I heard the brakes of his Jeep Wrangler squeal. I grabbed the drive and hurried to the bedroom, jumping into bed and throwing the covers over myself.

The front door latched closed, and I struggled to slow my breathing to an even, steady pace. I couldn't even begin to tell you the horrific thoughts that crossed my mind as I lay there, helpless. Just how far would he go to protect this secret from me? I listened to the noise of his wet feet *'plap-plaping'* around the house, using it to track his every movement like sonar. He never entered the bedroom, though. Just went through his normal morning routine, whatever that meant, then left for work. 

I didn't know if he'd seen me. *Hell,* a part of me didn't even care. Things couldn't continue this way. After what I'd just seen, it was impossible. Yet, somehow, John had been able to quickly conjure up an excuse for every outlandish behavior he'd displayed thus far. He'd probably tell me I must've been dreaming or something. Confronting him using only words wasn't an option. I needed irrefutable evidence, even more than I'd already collected. 

I called my boss, telling him I was sick and that I wouldn't be able to make it into work. He'd just have to wait one more day for that report. I had bigger fish to fry. I grabbed the laptop from my field bag and sat down at the island, booting it up and inserting the flash drive with shaking hands. I hesitated for a moment before opening the file. Did I really want to know the truth? Was I truly ready to open up this can of worms? I knew that from this point on, there was no going back. I inhaled slowly and deeply, then clicked. 

The top of the page read:
*MDI Biological Laboratory: Pioneering New Approaches in Regenerative Medicine.*   

*Fuck.* Jessica was right. Should I call her? No, I can't. She made it clear she didn't want to be involved. I was on my own with this. With bated breath, I scrolled on. 

What followed was a wall of text filled with scientific jargon. I'll spare you the complicated details and summarize the best I can in layman's terms. Researchers were able to create synthetic bioluminescence systems by modifying a specific enzyme called *'luciferase,'* using a process known as directed evolution. This allowed for use in various applications, including the deep organs and tissues of other living animals. Yes, you did read that correctly. 

There are more than forty known bioluminescent systems in the natural world, but only eleven of them have been able to be recreated and utilized by scientists with this specific technology. A new research project was formed in hopes of discovering how to manipulate and synthesize other bioluminescent systems, including those containing *'aequorin,'* the photoprotein responsible for creating *blue* light. 

Oh... my... fucking... God. I slammed the laptop shut. It all made sense; the clammy skin, the salt everywhere, the *'cold plunges,'* the *LOBSTER?!?!* Christ—all of it! *Son of a bitch.* I wondered what else I'd missed and started tearing the house apart, looking for more evidence. I'm well aware that I'd already collected more than enough in support of my theory. What I was looking for, secretly wishing for, was *anything* that might prove me wrong. 

Instead, I found more dried-up fish scales tucked away in different drawers all over the house. I found salt lining the corners of the floors and crusting to the edges of the baseboards. In the bathroom trashcan were several shrimp heads hidden underneath wads of slimy toilet paper. I remembered the hose and went out to the backyard to see what he'd been doing. 

A giant hole had been dug in the middle of our yard and filled with water, creating an enormous mud pit that spanned almost the entire length of the fence line. A dozen or so empty bags of aquarium salt lay discarded on the grass beside it. 

I dropped down to the ground, my knees hitting the cold, soggy grass at the same time my heart did. I knew. I knew with every fiber of my being. But I still needed to hear him say it. It was the only way I'd have any chance of helping him. I was convinced that this *had* to have been some sort of horrible accident. He must've gotten involved with this sketchy research somehow, and maybe he'd cut himself while handling some of the genetic material. 

If I could just find a way to force him into telling me what had happened. If I could back him into a corner to where he could no longer deny it, then maybe together, we could try to reverse whatever was going on with his body. Or, at the very least, stop it from getting any worse. I hoped. 

I walked inside the house, sat down at the laptop, and went back to the very first thing I'd researched when all of this crazy shit started. Hatchetfish. And then, with about four hours until he arrived back home from work, I formed a hypothesis and devised a plan.

Tuna. One of the top predators in the ocean. An unsuspecting killer lurking in the depths of the Atlantic. The local seafood market had it on sale that week. Freshly cut tuna steaks for $10.99 per pound. I drove into town and purchased two large steaks, along with the ingredients needed to make a lemon-caper sauce. Then, I sped back home, with my thoughts racing. 

I needed once and for all to expose him for the fish-man I knew he was. To provoke a response so extreme, so undeniable it would be impossible for him to hide or explain away. I didn’t care anymore about how he might react. I was prepared to do whatever I had to do to save my husband. I looked down at my watch. *3:41 PM.* A little more than an hour left. The food would take almost no time at all to prepare, so I used the remaining moments I had alone to go through our wedding album. 

I sat down on the couch with tears forming behind my eyes as I reflected on how happy that day was for us. Best day of our lives. The last five years with him had truly been so perfect. I couldn't understand why or even how it had all gone so wrong so quickly. All I knew was that I had to try to fix this. I had to get John back. 

I sunk down into the cushions and began hugging the throw pillow beside me. Suddenly, my phone vibrated, jolting me back into an upright position. 

""Headed home.""

*Go-time.* I shut the photo album, wiped my eyes, and then made my way to the kitchen. I started on the sauce first, throwing it together in about ten minutes and remembering to set aside a few lemon wedges to use as garnish. Then, I started searing the tuna: one and a half minutes on each side. I set two plates out on the island and took in a deep breath as I heard him pull into the driveway. 

My entire body was shaking, but I knew I had to try to stay calm. I couldn't risk spooking him before he was in position. 

""*Hey...*"" he said with a confused smile as he entered the kitchen. 

Standing strategically in front of the pan on the stove, I replied, 

""Hey, John. I've got a surprise for dinner tonight."" 

He sat down and sniffed at the air intensely. Then, he stopped, and the smile slowly faded from his face. His Adam's apple bounced upward as he swallowed hard, and his pupils began to dilate. 

""What is it?"" He asked nervously. 

I grabbed the pan from the stove and quickly plopped one of the steaks down onto the plate in front of him. 

""Tuna,"" I said. 

He looked down at it, and his eyes widened. As I began to pour the sauce over his steak, his nostrils flared, and he began breathing heavily. I squeezed a bit of juice from the lemon wedge around his plate. But I was so focused on watching him for a reaction that I accidentally squirted a droplet into his eye. 

He didn't flinch. Instead, two vertical-facing inner eyelids quickly slid from each corner, meeting in the middle with a squish. My mouth fell open, and I gasped. I dropped the wedge and ripped my hand away, but before I could even fully react to that horror, another began to unfold in front of me. On his stomach, underneath his button-up Hawaiian shirt, a set of six tiny blue lights began to glow. 

I jumped backward, tripping on the barstool next to me and hitting the ground hard. I quickly scrambled back up to my feet, then pointed my finger at John and screamed,

*""I FUCKING KNEW IT!!""*

His expression remained neutral as he looked down at his glowing belly, then back up at me. I'd finally caught him—no way he was going to be able to wriggle his way off *this* hook. There was nothing he could say, nothing he could do. Now, he'd have to admit to me what was truly going on. 

""Sonia. I'm dying.""

Those three words snatched the wind right out of my sails. It couldn't be real. My chest tightened, and my arm dropped back down to my side. The room filled with a stifling thickness as he looked up at me with dread. 

""*… What?*"" 

He hung his head low as he slowly pushed the plate away from himself and whispered, 

""I thought I had more time. But, nothing I've tried has worked.""

""John, I don't understand. Tell me what happened to you!"" I demanded. 

He took in a deep breath, tapped his finger on the island a few times, and then began to speak. 

""Back when this all started, I honestly never thought it would go *this* far. At first, it was just a joke. Howard dared me to do it. Stupid, I know.""

He forced out a nervous laugh. Then, his leg began bouncing up and down as I stared on in silence. His head rose, his lip beginning to quiver. He looked me straight in the eyes and continued,

""During the first few weeks, I quickly realized that some of the changes were, well, more than I'd bargained for, to say the least. Sonia, I swear! I tried to stop it, I tried to fix it. But I don't know, I just... couldn't keep myself from going back. I started to like it."" 

""*John,* are... are you telling me you did this to yourself? *On purpose??*"" 

A single black tear escaped from his eye, trailing down the side of his cheek. 

""I didn't know what would happen,"" he said, his voice trembling with shame. 

""Well, it stops now!!"" I screamed. 

He slowly stood up from the barstool and placed his icy-cold hand on my shoulder. While looking deep into my eyes, he said, 

""It's too late.""

""John, no! *Please,* we have to tell someone! We have to at least try to get you help!!"" I begged.

He shook his head, his face sullen and streaked with more black stains. 

""I've taken too many doses. The effects are irreversible at this point. I've been trying to do everything I can to make living on land more comfortable for myself, so I could stay here with you. But, no matter what I do, it's becoming increasingly unbearable by the minute. I'm so sorry, Sonia. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but... I just couldn't. I'm so ashamed. I don't even know who I am or *what* I am anymore. Please, *please* forgive me.""

At that moment, the earth stopped spinning. All sound escaped from the room, and I was left only with the deafening thud of my heartbeat flooding my ears. I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't cry. I just stood there, frozen and hollow, as all the pieces of this puzzle finally snapped into place, and my entire world crumbled around me. My knees buckled, and I fell forward into his arms. 

Somehow, I allowed myself to forgive him for what he had done to himself, for committing this act of betrayal that cut so deeply. He hadn't done it to hurt me. His curiosity had gotten the better of him. That was just John. We embraced each other tightly for a few minutes before I was able to finally work up the courage to ask him, 

""What do we do now?"" 

The answer was simple but far from easy. In fact, it would be the hardest thing I'd ever have to do in my life for many reasons, and I didn't know if I had the heart to bear it. This choice would be one of the most devastating decisions a person could be asked to make. And yet, I agreed. 

I'm at the cove now, watching the dark waves violently crash against the rocks, letting the cold breeze sweep across my face as the sun sets on the horizon. I'm going to end this by saying: I love my husband... I truly do. I'll try to come back here to visit him whenever I can. But I *cannot* watch him slowly die in our house. I can't be selfish like that. It isn't about what I want. It's about what *he needs.* And I know deep down in my heart the right thing to do for him is to let him go.

My job was to preserve and protect coastal ecosystems. But today, instead of a report, I'll be handing in my resignation. To anyone reading this: I'm so sorry. The truth is, I have no idea what I've just released into that water and unleashed onto the world.",16,1766520932.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,3,1.0,False

# Todd (T0DDinthe403)

 

# Meridian, Idaho

 

**Todd sits at his kitchen table, wearing a black, heavy-metal T-shirt with the sleeves cut off. He has a tattoo of a heart and the name Verna on his left shoulder, as well as a spider web on his elbow and a spattering of other tattoos in the classic style on his forearms and hands. The sink is filled with dirty dishes, the linoleum floor could use a mop, and the table that he’s resting his elbows on is littered with unopened mail, an empty fish tank with neon green stones in the bottom, a phone with a cracked screen, a bong, and a game of Monopoly that looks as if it had been abandoned after one of the players realized they had no chance of winning. This is all in sharp contrast to the yellow plaid curtains above the sink, the untouched furniture and carpet in the living room, and the oak table that could comfortably sit a family of four.**

**“Todd,” as I’ll refer to him, is in the witness protection program. He was the Assistant Director of** ***Wasteland*** **and turned himself in to the LAPD Hollywood precinct after escaping the Siberian film set. After 48 hours in a holding cell and multiple attempts on his life by both badged officers and police station admin, the FBI took him into custody. They relocated him to this suburb on the outskirts of Boise, ID.**

Kiril didn’t belong in our time. Kiril the Killer. Great nickname. You always hear about people who should have been born in the age of the Vikings. Those Viking bastards would have been shaking behind their little shields if they had to go up against this guy. He was a caveman. He should have been spearing a woolly mammoth, cutting open its chest with a sharp rock, and eating its heart right there… at midnight… in a blizzard.

 

**We’ll come back to this. Tell me about the early days on set. When you first arrived.**

 

Man, it was a trip. We had no budget, and when I say *no* budget, I mean like less than a hundred mil. Which isn’t *no* budget by a lot of standards, but we were doing something big. Fucking monstrous. That dough got us some rented choppers and a down payment on our principal actors, or at least enough to get them on those choppers. We had coordinators back home to help with the arrangements, but once we were up there, they all got axed via mass email. The rest was Brooklyn lot-lizarding. God knows whose dick that guy had to swallow to get the gear we needed. But that still wasn’t enough for him. Not by a long shot. He wanted a dragon. I had no idea how he was going to do that or even what he meant by it, but that was his one mission in life: To get a damn dragon on his show. I guess when his family left him, which ended his YouTube career because they were his content source, he was left with a hole in his heart the size of a thunder lizard.

I wasn’t there for the birth scene. I refused to be. I’m a gear junkie, so I was there for the tech and gambled on the show being a hit. The weird shit Brooklyn was obsessed with getting on tape, I helped with the setup, but I wasn’t down to watch it at first. That didn’t last long.

 

**What didn’t last long?**

 

**\[He chuckles.\]**

 

Not having to watch fucked up shit every day. Man, you’ve seen the show. I was there for all of it. I edited every episode. There’s a strange detachment that happens when all you see is footage of people on a screen. The people stop being real when they’re only on screen and it’s your job to trim and splice and put together a show. I got detached. But those people were real. Martun is a real girl.

The sun woke me up the morning after the birth, and it felt like I hadn’t slept more than an hour. Up there, it always seemed like the sun was setting one minute and rising the next until it would go away completely and not come back for months. That’s when things would get really bad.

The mattress was stuffed with straw, and the pillows were filled with fake goose down. The sleeping arrangement suited me fine. It was Ursa that could never grow to like it. But that morning, she slept like a bear at Christmas. When the light through the gap in the curtain hit her, she rolled over and pulled the blanket up over her eyes—she was still moving. She was still alive, and that was important to me at that time. She didn’t need to walk, cook, or garden. She just needed to breathe, and my cheque was still valid. There was blood in the bed, but I wasn’t about to wake her up to clean it. Sleep was what she needed.

Martun was in the basket on the floor next to me, wrapped in a blanky. Her eyes were open, but she wasn’t crying. She just looked up at me, blinking. I rolled out of the bed and grabbed her up. I’ve never been around kids. Never even held a baby, but I knew that she’d need a change. I put her on the bed and unwrapped her. The nurses must have put a cloth diaper on her, and the goddamn thing was filled with sticky black shit. Something was wrong with her, I thought. I wiped her up the best I could with the diaper, then grabbed her up again and left the bedroom. I kicked open the front door of the house. There was no one there to help. The crew had left, the doula was gone, and there was no sign of any of the people that were gathered last night. It was just us—just us and pasture land and a few trees up the hill behind the house. I shivered and puked beside the step. It had been four days since my last hit.

I went back inside. The front door opened right into the kitchen, and I put Martun on the floor and hoped she’d stay there while I opened every drawer and cupboard. There were some dishes, pots, and a cast-iron skillet, but no towels or cloths, no food, and sure as shit, no running water. The house was full of furniture—all crap. It was built for a movie set, not to be lived in. That was the story for most of the shit they left behind. Hardly any of it lasted the first year. The stove looked to be commercial-grade, and the windows were good. The structure of the house was solid, too—good logs and chinking. Good roof. I figured the tables, chairs, beds, and all that could be rebuilt when they fell apart.

 

**\[He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes, pulls his hair with his fingers, and lets out a low growl.\]**

 

What am I doing here? I got a newborn baby lying on a wood-plank floor, a half-dead woman in my bed, and not even a hole in the ground to take a dump in.

I’d been through worse, but being high made bad shit easy, and right then, bad shit was happening and I was sick in the worst way: sweating, shaking, shitting, puking, that thing where you lay in bed and it feels like your arms and legs are curling into your body.

# Todd

 

**Back to the beginning, Todd. What were the logistics?**

 

Yeah, okay, bro. We hired our crew out of Siberia. It was a group of ex-military shitheads that knew how to fly choppers. I can confirm that not a single one had a valid pilot’s license, but I don’t think they have a DMV for drunk Russian pilots up there. They called themselves The Stribog: the Slavic god of wind and good fortune. I called them the Shitbog. Their job was to fly up and drop off an entire town that we needed to prep for production. This was a place at the Northernmost tip of the continent, so no small feat. It used to be called Chukotka—a town that reached its highest population of all time in 1997. All of 16 people. But back then, it was all ice all year. Look it up on a map. It was the perfect location for this shit show. The Russians must have let the territory go for peanuts because that’s all we had. Fuckin’ moths were flying out of our pockets when we turned them inside out.

The Stribog’s job was to fly in the whole town. Every piece of every home, building, hovel, shack, stall, boxes of furniture, and enough food for a year… After that, the villagers were on their own. The Stribog did that part fine. The sky was filled with helicopters that first morning. Each one carrying a giant wooden crate with a red *W* stamped on it. The problem was that everything needed to be assembled. Those Russian bastards cracked open the one box that had the moonshine in it and proceeded to drink half the year’s supply in one night. Yeah, I had a couple too. But none of the set got built that day.

 

**Just a couple?**

 

Hey, man, we were celebrating. It was that night that it all started to feel real—months of preparation, budgetary bullshit, and a legal bill bigger than the GDP of Bulgaria. Brooklyn even had a drink. I blacked out by 9 p.m. and puked in my tent.

# Kiril

I picked Martun up off the floor and brought her to the bedroom. I did my best to wrap her back up like the nurse had done but ended up making her look like a loose-rolled joint. I put her in the basket, anyhow. Ursa wasn’t moving, but I brought the basket to her side of the bed. “I’m going out,” I said, “We need supplies. Baby’s right here. She’s got something wrong with her. Sticky black shit coming out of her.” Martun was still staring up at me, blinking. Something was not right with that kid. Maybe not in a bad way.

“You’re coming back for us?” It was the first words I’d heard Ursa say. Her voice was like gravel.

“Yeah,” I said.

I went back out the front door, quiet this time. The woman needed to rest, the baby probably needed to eat, but she wouldn’t cry. Weren’t babies supposed to cry? Cry so she could eat? I needed to eat. And we all needed a water supply. There’s a whole thing where people think all junkies are skinny little toothpicks, but that was never the case for me. I look back on it now, and yeah, that stuff made it easier to grind through a god-awful life where there’s no hope of getting a glimpse of something better, but now I had purpose, I had a few days off the shit and was starting to feel better. That was the first time I realized I would be forced clean for the next decade.

They set us up about a mile out of town and our house was the only one they built before they left for good. It was likely a security issue. They didn’t want anyone with easy access to Martun. To hurt her or to blow the big secret. That, and they wanted to keep the family as the center of attention—to not get us too intermingled with the townspeople.

 

**\[He shifts in his chair and looks at the floor beside him\]**

 

There was no road then. A line in the grass was beaten down that led to the water. Looking down it, a bit of smoke rose up in the distance. I walked toward it.

They wanted us to be different from the townspeople. Outsiders. To put us above them and away from them so that they were free to stew about us and come up with their own stories and lies. Probably what caused them to turn on us, and this just dawned on me, but right from the start, it was going on. Of course, they would treat us different. But that first time I walked into town, there was something rotten behind more than a few sets of teeth.

After walking for 20 minutes or so, I could see the boxes—hundreds of them. Why was our house fully assembled? The rest of the poeple are over there fending for themselves. I doubt they’ll take that lightly.

I get closer. I can’t see people yet, not fully, but there are screams. A figure darts away from one of the crates, and he’s carrying an armful of something. I start to jog. I close the distance in a couple minutes and walk into what feels like an all-out riot. It’s like the lootings after the Short War. Full-on monkey-brained anarchy.

The next day Brooklyn was pissed. Pissed-off, not drunk anymore. That man was mad. The Stribog were sleeping in their choppers, and Brooklyn had this big stick. He was naked but for a bathrobe and slippers and was walking from whirly-bird to whirly-bird, whacking the shit out of anyone that couldn’t get untangled from their sleeping bag in time. Every time he hit one, he yelled, “Never pay a Russian before they finish the job!” *Whack.* “Never pay a Russian!” *Whack*. It did more harm than good because those sons of bitches were airborne not ten minutes later. That, and these guys weren’t a bunch of Californian production assistants that you could treat like shit and they’d still want to buy a vile of your bathwater. One of them had enough after taking that stick to the shoulder, grabbed it out of his hand, tossed it on the ground, and punched Brooks once—hard as all hell—right on the button. Brooklyn came back with two black eyes and a cut on the bridge of his nose that bled for a week.

He’d paid them already and they up and bounced. That left us with a problem. We had about a hundred and fifty crates filled with—man, there was an entire town in those crates. A disassembled town. Literally. It was just me and Brooklyn walking through a maze of boxes that were taller than we were. His shoulders were all hunched up, and his back stiff. He was steaming—standard protocol for that guy.

We had 22 hours until the next fleet came in: the Americans. You could count on these guys to execute their entire contract, but all they had to do was drop off 100 civilians and jet.

The American choppers rolled in by sunset, which, at that time of year, was about 2 PM. They touched down in the field next to all the boxes, and the people hopped out of the helicopters like scared little sheep. 20 children, 60 adults, and 20 retirees. An even split of male and female with a spattering of every race, sexual orientation, and gender you can think of. It was strange to see them all standing there in costume. According to Brooklyn’s vision, Epitown was meant to resemble a fur trading fort from the early 1600s. The people were in rags and the cheapest artificial fur we could find. Our costume designer hated Brooklyn with a passion. Brooklyn didn’t care. I admire him for that. He could give two shits what you thought about him. He was singularly driven to get this show made, and if he couldn’t afford real fur, screw it, he’d make do. How would Martun know the difference?

But man, these people were stunned. It was like a buzzsaw leveled out their socio-economic status despite the fact they were all criminals of some sort. But all of a sudden, no one person was better than another. Money didn’t exist. Race, age, and what kind of genitals you wanted to rub up against didn’t matter anymore. Granted, none of them had much going for them in the real world. Brooklyn plucked the most desperate people he could find, and who knows what he promised them. If there’s one thing I came to realize while working on this show, it is that no matter the arena, there will always be a power struggle. Put chickens in a ring, and they’ll naturally figure out a pecking order. They all knew what they were being paid and how long they would be there, but fuck me left, right, and straight ahead, they *had* to know their societal rank, and they all jostled for imaginary power starting immediately.

 

**So, who built Epitown?**

 

That was the brilliant idea I mentioned—my brilliant idea. We got the actors to build the whole town themselves.

# 

 

# Vitaly

 

# Polyarnaya Sova (Arctic Owl) Prison

# Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia

 

**There is a dead rat in an old-style mousetrap in the corner of the room. That is certainly where the smell is coming from. I pull my scarf over my mouth and nose and can still see my breath in little puffs through the fabric. The walls are concrete with rust-colored stains oozing down them. There are no windows. The only furniture in the room is the chair I’m sitting in, the table, and another chair on the other side of the table. The man that I will be interviewing is Vitaly \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

**The door clanks, and then squeals open. The man stoops his head more than six inches so that he can clear the doorframe. They do not have him in leg chains, let alone handcuffs. He turns to the guard behind him and, with his chin, motions for him to leave. The guard narrows his eyes and then backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.**

**I stand up. Vitaly still doesn’t look at me, but with his shoulders back and his chest out, he walks to the corner of the room, crouches, releases the dead rat’s neck from the trap and puts the carcass in the pocket of his once-white jumpsuit. He stands back up, still facing the corner.**

**“Please,” I say, “have a seat.” I feel an overwhelming urge to get this interview over with as soon as possible.**

**Vitaly pulls the chair out from the table and sits. The furniture looks almost miniature with him occupying it. His knees are well above the tabletop. He grimaces at me, showing only bare gums. When admitted to Arctic Owl, it is prison policy to remove each inmate’s teeth as they can be used as weapons. His cheeks shine with scar tissue from fights and frostbite. Each of his ears has been frozen down to its base, and the stubs look like the bottoms of broken pint glasses. He looks through me. One of his purple eyelids droops down further than the other. He places both of his fists on the table with a** ***thud.***

**Vitaly was cast as the villain on** ***Wasteland***\*\*. He and his group were originally placed several kilometers away from Epitown and were featured sporadically throughout the first few seasons in an attempt to create an air of a looming threat and mystique.\*\*

 

I sit in helicopter for many hours with bag on my head, hands behind back. I see only black, but I know am between one man and one woman. I smell her perfume mixed with diesel fuel from old battle helicopter. Brooklyn buy helicopter from Russian government or maybe mafia. Probably both.

When we land, I feel hands on my shoulders. They pull me up. I bonk my head on ceiling. The man hold me, he say, “Let’s go *svo-lach.*” It mean *scumbag* in English. He push me. Kick me in back and I fall out of helicopter and I land with my face in dirt.

I hear more people falling. They grunt a little when they hit. Then big boxes fall down and all this kind of things. There are more helicopters. Two, maybe three. Same thing. People, then boxes.

I rub my head on ground like this and I take bag off my head.

 

**\[He motions side to side with his head\]**

 

The helicopters they leave. In helicopter, I see man who push me. Now I know it was Brooklyn. I recognize piece of shit face. I yell to him, “Fuck you!” my hands still behind my back. He take out his gun, he shoot at my feet and he laughing. Fuck him.

 

**\[Spittle dances on his bottom lip.\]**

 

There is 30... maybe 40 people. Mostly it is men, some woman and small child. It is hard to say how many because to keep track of dead in first year is difficult. They die in night, they die in morning, they die here, they die there, we just leave them. We have no choice or we die next, you know?

First thing we do when everyone is together is we open boxes. It is animal fur and skin. We take out fabric, put it on ground in pile, and we stand there, and we scratch our heads. What is this? Is this blanket? Very interesting what they leave to us. We don’t know what is it? We lay it on grass, stretch it out, you know. Then I figure what is it.

 

**\[He explodes into laughter.\]**

 

Teepee. They give us fucking teepee to live in. You know, the cone made out of animal? Like we are *Chukchi*! I do not know word in English for these people.

 

**I think you mean** ***indigenous***\*\*.\*\*

 

Sure. I can not believe. It is like fantasy land. 24 hours before, I was sitting in cell with 20 years left on sentence, thinking how I should end my life.

I look at my people. Most of men was plucked from whatever prison all over Russia. I do not recognize any from my prison. The woman are prostitutes or maybe from shelters not much better than prison. Brooklyn maybe pay less than 10,000 roubles to get them. Children is same thing, but there is no charge for orphan children, gypsy children. You just take. Take from street, take from alley. Nobody care. Do it midday, Red Square, nobody give a shit. They think is good! Cleaner streets, they say.

Other things in box is tools like caveman use. Hammers that is stick and it has rock tied to it, leather bags filled with heads of arrow made from stone, animal fur, food cans with beans inside, and that all that it was. We have very little. We laugh because this situation. To laugh, it is our way.

Most of the crates had at least one of its sides taken off. I take a closer look into one of them. The floor’s covered in broken glass, and I’m hit with a sweet smell, fruit juice.

A kid with his face tatted up runs by me with an armful of canning. I bodycheck him and he hits the grass. Jars of peaches and plums clank and bounce off the turf. A couple of them shatter. I’m on him quick. Grab him by the collar of his cheap fur coat. “Where you off to?”

He twists, but I got a good grip on him. I slap him once, and he settles down.

“The fuck you talking about, man?”

“Where you going to take it?” I look back to the farm. Shit. Shouldn’t have looked. Don’t want to give him any ideas. “You got somewhere to go with all this?”

“I don’t fucking know.” He quiets and cocks his head to one side. “Be gentle with me, daddy bear. I just want to eat.” His voice turned all cutesy-wutesy.

I push him back onto the grass, and his shirt comes up, showing his white belly and a few more tats.

“Go eat your peaches,” I say.

The kid gets up, grabs a jar in each hand, and runs off, turning and raising the middle finger of one of his jar hands. He said something like, “Fuck you, you dusty old badger.”

I keep going. People are piled into the crates snatching anything of worth and throwing everything else in the dirt, things that would be valuable one day. I knew it even then; they were looting themselves. There’s a group of three men and one woman sitting on the ground, gorging themselves on what looks like canned cat food.

I couldn’t be the only one here with a head screwed on straight. But if that were the case, we were in worse trouble than I thought, and if they didn’t settle down and start using their brains, it meant I would step up. I was in no mood to be these people’s “leader.”

 

**\[He uses air quotes\]**

 

I spent most of my life alone before the show. Still do, obviously. But what I was watching was stupidity, and if I let it keep going, a year’s worth of supplies would be gone in a week.

I look into a crate that’s mostly filled with lumber and building supplies. Someone’s sleeping under a sheet of clear plastic between a stack of 2X4s and the wall. There’s a giant bell on top of a stack of planks. An iron bell, like you’d see on a church. I reach up and slide the thing toward me. It weighs a ton, but I can hold it in my arms like a calf. I put it down and lift up the wall of the crate that had been pried off. I lean the crate wall against the crate, then pick the bell back up. Damn near throw my back out, but I heave the bloody thing up on top of the crate. I toss a two-foot 2X4 up and then use the crate wall like a ladder to climb onto the box. I tip the bell on its side and bang the hell out of it. *Dong, dong, dong.*

Ahh, the sea cans. We slept in one and our studio was in another. Our camp was in a cozy valley surrounded by a little forest of spruce trees. Those first few years, we lived like the villagers did: no running water, no showers or kitchen just cans of tuna and vegetables. We were probably worse off than the Epitownies because neither Brooklyn or I had any survival skills whatsoever. We were Hollywood brats, and the last thing we planned for was inclement fucking weather. The scientists all but stopped tracking environmental data in the north after the 60s. What was the point, right? We pulverized the climate, and there was no going back. Besides, nobody lived up there, and as is true for most humans, they don’t give a rat’s ass about an issue unless it’s directly affecting them. So basically, we planned our production/living situation based on pre-war weather and climate data—back when the North was basically a frozen desert. On top of that, Brooklyn assured me over and over that global warming had made his land perfectly livable, like farmland in central Ohio. Sure, he said, it would get a bit chilly in the winter, but the summers would be beautiful. “Things grow there now,” he said. We all knew that the glaciers were gone, so I had no reason not to believe him.

It took me until November that year, when my balls were frozen to the side of my leg, to figure out what we’d be dealing with. The most snow I’d seen up until that point was a half-inch when I worked in San Francisco, and the whole city shut down because of it. It felt like most mornings, I had to dig myself out of the dorm and pretty much tunnel to the studio. Turns out in the north, climate change or global warming or whatever they called it didn’t mean a gradual and equal increase in temperature. It meant that the highs would be higher and the lows would be lower, like my bipolar mother, rest in power. It would be hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, the storms would be crazier, and the snow would be deeper. Fuck. My. Life.

I sensed early that Brooklyn and I would eventually wear out each others’ welcomes. That guy was on the edge of flipping his wig on a good day. I could only imagine how that spaz cadet would act when things started to go sideways. He had an oldschool Glock 48 that he kept in the bottom drawer of his metal desk in the studio. He loved to take it out and point it at the screens when characters he didn’t like made an appearance. It made me uncomfortable to say the least, but he never pointed it at me. One morning before he’d stalked into the studio muttering and cursing, I emptied the clip and tossed the bullets as hard as I could into the snow. They say you can tell by the weight if a gun is unloaded, but I’m pretty sure he’d never held a gun before, and he sure as shit didn’t have a feel for it. I just hoped he wouldn’t up and take it target shooting, but he wouldn’t risk making that kind of noise.

The clamoring in the crates and the greedy whimpering stop. I hit the bell five or six more times. People start to gather around, necks cocked back and dumb looks on their faces. There are three dozen of them, or so. It’s not everyone in the cast but it’s enough to gain some order.

“How’s the baby?” one of the men asks. He’s chewing on some dried apricots and has the package in his hand to prove it.

Someone else asks, “Why you clanging on that bell?”

“Better to clang on this bell than on that empty skull of yours.” I’m not trying to be funny but the crowd chuckles. Better that than having them climb up and jump me. “Not everyone is here, but it looks like you all are ready to settle down, is that right?”

Some of them nod, and some of them shrug.

“You realize all this stuff belongs to us, right? All of us. These boxes are filled with supplies. The one I’m standing on has building materials in it. Nobody is getting ahead by looting. So if you’re not ready to settle down, none of us are getting through this.”

“Where’s the production crew?” a woman calls out.

“Gone,” I say. “It’s just us. Which means we’re going to have to figure out how to live. I’m not your leader, okay? I don’t want to be your friend, either. But I know we won’t make it to the first snowfall if it’s every man for himself. Would be surprised if some of you made it through another night.” The man who was sleeping in the crate below me saunters into my view, scratching his head.

From my vantage point, I see someone peeking from behind one of the crates behind the crowd. It’s a kid, I’m sure of it. I remember seeing a few kids the night before, but this one is younger. “God damn cruel motherfuckers,” I say, pointing at the kid. “Someone grab her.”

A woman crouches down and goads the child toward her. The little girl is hardly old enough for school. She’s holding a doll made out of sticks and a pink ribbon. She lets the woman pick her up. The woman peeks behind the crate, and I can hear her gasp. “Oh my god,” she says, “there’s more of them.”

Close to a dozen kids file out from behind that crate—some of them barely old enough to walk, and some of them school age.

“How long have you people been here?” I call out—selfish pricks.

The woman holding the child says, “Not much longer than you.” There’s embarrassment in her voice, and she avoids eye contact with me.

“Listen,” I say, “you all want your money, right? And your freedom? I do too. We can all get what we want, but we have to stick it out. Who here knows how to read blueprints? Who has construction experience?”

A guy in the crowd raises his hand. He’s of Asian descent, clean-shaven with his hair short. He looks like a businessman wearing his wife’s fur coat.

“Good. What’s your experience?” I say.

“Military,” he says. “I was an engineer.”

“Perfect. What’s your name?”

“My real name?”

“What are we supposed to call you?”

“Mikhail.”

“Alright, Mikhail, come here,” I say. “This crate that I’m standing on has plans in it. Find them. Figure out what we’re working with.” I take a good look at the crowd. It’s tough to tell if any one of them can swing a hammer on account that they’re all dressed in rags. “Anyone else built anything before? Anything. A spice rack in shop class will do.”

A few more hands go up.

“You’re helping Mikhail, there. Now, what about these kids? We need volunteers to take them on.”

“Why not you?” a man shouts.

“You know I got my hands full already.”

A woman asks, “Where is she? Where are you keeping her?”

“That doesn’t matter now. What matters is that we get set up as much as we can before nightfall. What do we have for food? Who’s seen food crates?”

“I have,” a woman says with her hand up. “Lots of them have been emptied out already, but there’s plenty left.”

“Get a team together and take stock. We need to know what we have, and we need to protect it. The rest of them out there are going to get real hungry real quick. They’ll come back. They need to understand that they have to join us or starve.

“Mikhail, what do you got?”

The man looks up at me. “It’s some kind of chapel in this box. Seems easy enough to assemble. It all fits together in big pieces. Hardly needs any nails in it. There’s also plans for where the cameras have to go.” He holds up a 2X8 piece of lumber and points at one of the knots in the wood. “There’s a recording device in there. It’s very specific as to where it needs to point. Looks to be about 10 of them in the chapel alone.”

A young man pushes his way through the crowd and approaches Mikhail. “Let me see that.”

Mikhail shrugs and hands him the board.

The kid motions for everyone to stand back.

“What are you doing?” I say.

“I want to get a better look at it,” the kid says. “Fuck their cameras. What are they gonna do about it?” He cracks the board against the side of the crate I’m standing on. Nothing happens. He does it again.

“Stop!” It’s someone at the back of the crowd. There’s panic in the voice. I spot him. It’s the wide-eyed man in the robes from the night before. The Listener. He barges through the group with surprising strength for a guy that looks like he’s pushing 60.

“Do not destroy it!” he shouts again. “They are coming.”

“What the hell do you know, old man?” the kid says before giving the board one more whack against the crate. It breaks in half right at the knot that Mikhail pointed out.

“Put it down,” I say.

“Why?” The kid digs at the wood and pulls out a device so small it could fit in a thimble. “I got it!” He holds it up between his forefinger and thumb.

“Drop it,” I say, louder this time.

The kid slowly lowers his hand. We can all hear it now. It starts as a low rumble and gets louder and louder until it’s scraping the sky right above us. The kid lets out a nervous chuckle, his eyes darting from side to side. The drone passes us forty or so feet above our heads. It’s not one of those toy helicopter-looking drones. It’s more like an airplane without a windshield. The smell of jet fuel fills the air. The drone banks left and circles back toward us. The kid drops the device into the dry grass. He falls to his knees and puts his hands up like he’s getting mugged. “I’m sorry! I’ll put it back. I’ll put it back! I’ll put it back!”

His blood is in the air before the sound of gunfire reaches us. The bullets enter the kid’s upper chest and splash out of his back like a handful of pebbles dropped into a still pond. He twists and falls to the ground awkwardly with one arm crossed under him and his dead eyes bugging out. The crowd erupts into a frenzy, with people running in any and every direction. The little girl, abandoned by the woman, stands alone in the center of the chaos, clutching her doll tight against her chest and crying.

# Vitaly

First year, Alyona is maybe thirteen years old, something like this. They take her from near her house in St. Petersburg. The house was Biblioteka Vkusov, a library. Her fingers is painted with black nail polish and she has holes in face where production staff remove piercing. Her hairs was short like boy so not to get raped by soldier or drunk when she sleep on street. She look at me and ask me, “So what we do now?”

“Why you ask me?” I say. “I know nothing. I’m like everyone else.” I point finger at group.

“Because you are big. Size make difference in fight. I think we will have many.”

“What is your name?” I ask.

“Alyona.”

“I am Vitaly.”

“You have plan, Vitaly? Or you stand around and laugh until we freeze?”

“Okay. We figure out how to make teepee. It will be dark soon, and cold. We make fire. The food they give us will not last more than one week. We find place with water and way to get food. Sound good? It is plan?”

A young man, maybe twenty years old, he speaks. He is small, thin, with sharp nose, and bald on head. “I know what we must do.”

“What do you know?” I ask.

“I hear them. In my head.” He point to his ear. “They tell me I am only one. You got your eyes done, yes? They put camera lens into eyes?”

The people say yes with their head, they go up and down. I also do this.

“Well, they put tech into my ear, into my brain.” He put his hand to his head and make like a spider and he make face as if he is in pain. “I hear them. Not always. They come and go, the two of them. They speak Russian with thick American accent.”

Alyona asks, “What do they tell you?”

He looks to ground and he not want to answer. “That we are alone. There will be no help. These boxes… That is all they will give us. They say there is deer close to here. They say the word for *reindeer* but maybe misspoken. I think we will have to hunt them.”

I ask him, “Do they say something about this... this television show?”

“Yes. They say we have one *challenge* right now.” He say word ‘challenge’ like it is very serious. I think this mean there will be more. “We must survive winter.”

Now the people is not laughing

“What is your name?” I say.

“They say you call me, *Slushatel’*.”

In English, this mean Listener.

Before I can ask more question, Alyona pointed into distance. “Smoke,” she say.

Slushatel say, “Yes. That is village where Martun live. One day, they ask us to attack this village so we can have our freedom. And money. They say they will give much money.

People was not laughing.

What a deadeye shot that was. Brooklyn informed me that we killed that kid to abide by the *broken window theory* and that we needed a *show of force, or shock and awe*. We needed to show them that we were not to be fucked with and to show them as early as possible. The broken window theory comes from way back in the day when crime was out of control in big cities. The idea is that if some punk kid breaks a window in an abandoned building and you don’t fix the window or punish the person responsible, you’re basically saying to the world, ‘Hey, we don’t give a shit about our things. Come tag up our walls, rob our people, vandalize our property, etcetera. Go wild.’

Brooklyn did the kid. Hell of a good shot for his first kill. After that, those villagers fell in line like coke on a coffee table. That lucky bastard. If he would have missed, those people would have seen our belly. They would know we weren’t gods. Ironically, in those first years, Brooklyn had chinced out on our security to make sure our production gear and facility were top-notch. We didn't even have a bullet for each villager. So, here’s a group of people who think we could take each and every one of them out at the drop of a dime.

 

**\[He snaps his finger.\]**

 

But really, we were a couple dudes ten clicks away pulling together edits of their lives and pissing in milk jugs. That’s showbiz, baby.

 

**Tell me more about the tech you guys used. How did just the two of you manage to collect so much footage, to cover so much?**

 

I know you’re here investigating all the crimes that happened, but don’t be asking me about how Brooklyn financed the thing. I have no idea. He never told me squat. I was just there to run the gear, dude. So if you’re coming in here trying to catechize me—man, I’m not spilling beans I don’t got.

 

**Todd, I’m not asking anything to do with how Mr. Kazan financed the show. I am, however, interested in the technology you used, but not how much it cost or where you acquired it.**

 

Shit, brother, why didn’t you say so? I’ll give you a list.

 

**\[He picks up the phone on the kitchen table and gestures toward me with it. I take my device out of my jacket pocket and accept the message. It reads as follows:\]**

 

On-Set:

* RED Digital Cinema - V-Raptor 8K VV Super 35 Cinema
* Google Lens X 7.1.4 25 Megapixel w/ Verse mod (X98)
* Baha Implantable Hearing/Recording System (X2)
* Unmanned Combat Aerial Drone equipped with M134 Minigun (X3)
* NVIDIA DGX GH6400 AI-Powered Supercomputer (200 Petaflop processing power)
* NVIDIA HGX w/ A320 Tensor Core GPUs (X16)
* Glock 17 (X1)

 

We had eyes and ears in every home and hovel, and if there were no buildings around, we had an eye cam installed in every adult and child over 6. We turned these people into walking recording studios—that, and enough processing power and digital storage to carry Western Europe’s data load. We were jacked to the tits.

 

**How did you keep all the people from escaping? Wouldn’t they just walk away?**

 

You’d think so. That was big on the message boards in the first season. “Why didn’t everybody just walk away? Were there walls?”

No, there were no walls. Everyone was 100% free to walk South. Or they could walk East. Just walk down to where? China? That would have been a 2,000-kilometer hike. You want to go to Alaska? Sure. That’s at least a couple hundred clicks to the water, and once you get there, I hope you brought a boat because the Bering Strait is 100 km to the other side, brother.

We didn’t need a wall. I didn’t think anyone could survive that hike, and if they did, it would take them years. You walk until your little heart’s content. Then we got to know Kiril and Martun and realized that those two are built different.
