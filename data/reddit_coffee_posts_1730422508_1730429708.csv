We tell each other everything, including our secrets, except for one: how I stalked him before I made my move.  Title: How I Stalked My Husband.A few years ago, I was sitting in my favorite café when I first laid eyes on him—let’s call him Jake. He was at a corner table, engrossed in a book, and I was instantly captivated. He had this charming smile that made my heart skip a beat, and I thought, “I have to know him.” At first, I didn’t plan to stalk him. I just thought I’d keep coming to the café and hope to run into him. So, I made the café my second home. I’d strategically choose a table near his, pretending to read or work while stealing glances. Every Tuesday and Thursday, like clockwork, he’d show up for his cappuccino.I did a little digging on social media. I found mutual friends and started following them to learn more about him. I discovered he loved hiking, so I joined a local hiking group that I knew he was a part of. I didn’t want to seem too obvious, but my excitement was building! Finally, during a group hike, I spotted him. I casually introduced myself, trying to act cool, but inside I was freaking out. We hit it off! After that, I started suggesting hikes and coffee outings with the group, hoping to spend more time with him.One day, I mustered the courage to invite him to grab coffee—at the same café, of course. To my delight, he agreed! As we chatted, I found out he was just as charming and funny as I had imagined. We shared stories, laughs, and before I knew it, we were spending more time together.Fast forward a few months, and our friendship blossomed into something beautiful. I never told him how I had stalked him but I think it made our story more interesting. Eventually, during a romantic dinner, he took my hands and asked me to marry him.I said yes, of course! Our wedding was a celebration of how a chance encounter turned into a lifelong love. So, while my initial approach might have been a little unconventional, it all worked out in the end.And that, Reddit, is how I went from secretly watching a cute guy at a café to marrying him!

1ggvw99,https://i.redd.it/jmk37zz5f7yd1.jpeg,Eye Issues Since August,"A bit of a long story but I hope you guys have the time. For starters, I'll say now that I (29M) have IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and I've suffered infrequent ocular migraines for years. So this was back in August, I had an optometrist appointment for new glasses and a new updated prescription at target. I went and I got it done, I got new glasses, they're much better. But a week after getting my glasses, it's on a Friday, I suddenly got a headache, it was really tiring, maybe it was the fact I got drank almost 3 cups of coffee that morning or maybe just a random headache, so after getting home around noon, I wanted to stay home and my dad was pending on making two different trips to pick up two different family members. Suddenly my dad doesn't leaves and suddenly doesn't pick up anymore so I have to go with my headache. It was a ROUGH two drives and that night I random was playing video games when suddenly I saw a spot around the center of my vision like an after image but it wouldn't go away  so I braces for impact thinking it was going to be an ocular migraine but nothing and this lasted like two hours so I obviously freaked and maybe in my little freak out I was becoming too hyperaware that I feel I started seeing more floaters or at least acknowledging the ones I always had but it was a horrible night mentally but they went away yet my eyes still felt like they were throbbing and shaking. That was August 24 and since then I've noticed my eyes have stayed feeling throbbing, shaking, vibrating, whatever the word is. My vision has this grainy aura around the bottom and top and sides. Not the type of aura that you get during ocular migraines mind you. That aura I personally feel you can't even see your hand in places under the aura. This is more like just film grain kind of. I've always been an anxious person so this has made my health anxiety sky rocket because I don't know if this started then or it's always been this way but hyperfixation has ruined me to see it always now. What I mostly notice is this flicker around the center. Things I stare at don't flicker in the light but the things around do. Like if there's a ceiling fan ruened on. That type of flicker. And when i close my eyes I feel I see twitches and faint flashes and lots of visual snow it's made ot harder to sleep. In general this has affected my mental health really bad and I feel so dissociated and depersonalizated at times. But there's moments where I'm so distracted that I don't notice it or remember it even when I'm driving I don't see it. Those moments make me realize it may not be serious. I did an MRI/MRV only because I had one scheduled from July since I had migraines all month and I'm seeing the results Nov 8 and a neurologist November 21. It's also been quite the year. Since March I've been with my mom since she was diagnosed with cancer and all the terrible changes and surgeries that come with it BUT she's cancer free as of now but going through a really rough chemo treatment which has taken a lot on us too so I'm stress and anxiety is definitely NOT off the table here. My shoulders and neck have been so stiff and painful. I freaked out a bit about my optometrist visit because she dilated my eyes and I left and I think she forgot to give me the visor because I never got one and that walk to the car and ride home made me feel so scared of eye damage from the sun but I kept my head down and eyes closed and covered the whole way but I stayed with the anxiety that it may have damaged me a bit but I know that can be silly to worry about so much. I just have terrible anxiety that I'll go blind or something. I just have a fear it's a tumor or I'm going blind but my opthalmologist saw me and didn't dilate my eyes but he didn't notice anything off except a bit of inflammation behind my eye which I've had and have been treated for with diamox a few years ago but he thinks it could maybe be IIH again but without the eye pains I had before when I first got diagnosed. Here's a photo to give you a more or less idea. When I look at yellow, the blue flickers. When I look at blue the yellow flickers. When I look at the purple, the yellow flickers as well. Sometimes I get the flicker really prominent when I'm anxious or nervous or really emotional but I've always had bad anxiety but I've never noticed this.

I often work out of that coffee shop (for a couple years now - say 3-5/times a month). She’s always so sweet and always tries to hook it up (free drinks etc.). We’ve barely chatted in all this time; but I get her gifts as a thank you every so often. 

Unfortunately, I don’t seem to attract women my age. The majority of interest I get from woman is 18-25, and 40+. 40-25 is somewhat of a dead zone for me. I’ve never really figured out why. I don’t really entertain 40+, as they often have lifestyles that are not in sync with mine. Under 25 just feels strange, and I’ve limited the interaction unless the woman is really aggressive and I’ll give it a go.

With the barrista, I feel conflicted. We likely have nothing in common, but I just strangely feel drawn to her. It’s an energy that I don’t feel with others. But I can’t get over the age difference. Hence 2 years and no real convos. I also relate 0 to the TikTok generation; so it just feels like a dead end. On the hand, I won’t know unless I give it a shot. But I also would feel creepy being seen with her in public. I look a little younger; but no less than 35.

I’m stumped.

I took misoprostol 6 hours ago and feel as though I’m through the worst of it?

The cramping has stopped and bleeding has slowed down. 

I just feel like I didn’t pass enough for it to be complete? My biggest fear is having an incomplete miscarriage and getting an infection or complications before my follow up in 2 weeks.

But I also might not have had as much to pass since it was a BO and I’ve been spotting everyday for 2 weeks?

1ggvn34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ggvn34/should_i_leave/,Should I leave? ,"Never used reddit but I'm sinking so here I go. Gonna give as much info as possible. My husband (35M) and I (34F) met when we were 18 and 19 and have been married 11 years. We used to party a lot and we were total stoners. Since getting married, I went to college, got a degree and kind of gave up the pot. I still smoke occasionally on weekends and am not a pot hater but we have two kids now so it's not a priority.  He is still a daily smoker. No problem except it holds him back from achieving anything and he spends about $60-$100 a week on it.  He has a decent job but no financial goals, no retirement, and no plan for the future. The job he works now he works strictly bc they don't drug test (he would never admit this). He is so smart and capable but he doesn't really seem to want to achieve anything further. I took a job over an hour away a couple of years ago and commute four days a week and work ten hour days. I took this job after he lost his job from failing a drug test. I was pregnant and we were trying to pay two mortgages at the time (another long story). I felt like I had to step up and take financial responsibility bc I couldn't depend on him. Over the years we accumulated about $12000 in credit card debt. About a year ago I decided I was done paying credit cards off and consolidated it. I've been paying $800/ month since then trying to pay it off. I pay all the bills, manage the house, and do almost everything for the kids. The man wont even make his own hair appointments. I. Am. Tired. Almost all of my check is gone as soon as it hits the bank from bills. About 1/3 of his monthly income goes to the sitter and he  pays for some of the groceries. I also buy groceries when I have anything left from my check. Just for reference he makes about $46000/ year and I make about $80000/year. Trying to pay the credit cards plus all the bills is pretty much all of my income. We have put a little money back on the cards that I consolidated, so that sucks, but he had one card in his possession. I just checked the balance on the one card that he has and since September it has increased by almost $1800. We did agree to put a gift for our son's birthday that was about $400 but almost everything else was him eating out for lunch and spending at the convenience store. I bring my lunch everyday, make my coffee at home most mornings and for the most part live pretty frugal. There are so many other things that I do to try to save money that he counteracts but it's too much to list.  When I checked the balance to pay the bill on the card that he had in his possession, I had to hold back tears. I have been working so hard to try to get us out of debt and was totally shocked that the balance had increased so much. To have someone who is supposed to be a partner spend so frivolously without any consideration of how it's gonna get paid back was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back. There are a lot of other things too, like us having a set amount of money that we have to share for the week and him spending 75% of it in 3 days. This leaves me with no money for gas to drive to my job and forced to put that on credit cards. He also still makes sure he buys weed as soon as one of our checks hits the bank before we even pay bills or buy groceries. In full transparency, I do drink beer more now instead of smoke but only on the weekends and I make sure I buy my beer at the grocery store bc the convenience store is a rip off. Thats cost about $20/weekend. We also both smoke cigarettes (gross I know) but i smoke about 1/2 a pack to his two packs daily. I also reload my Starbucks card every two weeks and put $20 on it. Pretty much everything extra I have is spent on the household or our kids. I just don't understand how he can constantly put smoking pot over getting a better paying job and spending $40/day at the store and on lunch. That proverbial straw that broke the camels back finally ended in me asking him to leave.  Part of me is excited at the possibility of having financial freedom one day and not having to take care of him like a third child.

A little about me; 

My interest, creative writing, music, video games (don’t have much time as I used to for it ), going for walks/hikes/drives, beach combing, art and small art projects. Mental and physical well being. 

I work overnights, I’m up when people are asleep and asleep when people are normally up, probably another reason why I am choosing Reddit to look for romantic interest.

1ggvds9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggvds9/my_morning_commute_did_not_take_me_to_work/,My morning commute did NOT take me to work.,"Monday January 8th 2024 started out just like any other day. The only notable thing was that it was my first day heading back to the office after my employer had shut down company operations for 3 weeks as they did every year during the holidays. The seasonal depression was really starting to kick in now that all the fun was over and we just had another three months of freezing rain to look forward to before summer. Winter used to be my favourite season as a kid but due to climate change it's just become depressing. It hardly ever snows anymore here in the GTA so everything is just cold, grey and damp all the time, today being no exception. 

Traffic on the 404 was actually moving at a decent pace for once this morning despite the weather. I was torn between being happy that I wasn't stuck in the typical morning gridlock and being slightly disappointed that I would actually make it to work on time. As I approached the 401 interchange where the 404 turns into the Don Valley Parkway the rain began to come down a lot harder. The dump truck I'd been following began to slow down, as did the rest of the traffic around me. I could have sworn I heard thunder over the roar of the rain pelting my windshield. ""Thunderstorms in the winter time?"" I thought to myself. It didn't make sense but then again it was also supposed to be -10 and snowing this time of year not 6 degrees and pouring down rain so I guess anything is possible.

I began pressing down on the brake pedal to slow my car to the speed of the truck in front of me when suddenly my foot slammed into the floor. I immediately panicked thinking I had lost my brakes and I took my right hand off the steering wheel to reach for the emergency brake. When I'd first started driving my dad had taught me a trick where you can hold down the button on the emergency brake so it doesn't lock and you can feather it on and off to slow down if you ever lose your brakes. I was about halfway through executing this plan when I froze. I froze because I realized something. The hand I had taken off the steering wheel hadn't been holding the steering wheel at all, and neither was the other one. In fact I wasn't even in my car. My brain finally caught up to my surroundings and I realized I was sitting in a plastic classroom chair in the middle of what appeared to be a warehouse. I was sitting in the chair with my arms out as if I was a kid pretending to drive a car, except I was actually driving a car, or at least I had been just mere seconds ago. Had I just blacked out on the entire drive to work? I did work at a logistics company but this did not look like our warehouse.

I slowly stood up and looked around the room. All I could see around me were wooden crates and plastic Pelican cases that looked vaguely like military gear of some kind. The only other object of note was a big yellow forklift sitting near the end of the row of crates. I began to walk towards it thinking maybe I could find the operator and figure out just what the hell was going on. An electric hum came from the forklift as I approached it. I don't know a lot about heavy machinery but I assumed that meant it was running. ""Hello?"" I shouted out into the vast expanse of the building. Only an echo returned. I peaked inside the cab of the forklift and indeed it was on judging by the position of the key and the gauges on the dash being lit up. This meant someone had to be nearby because I'm sure it's gotta be a massive OSHA violation to leave a forklift turned on unattended. 

I called out a few more times but no reply came. Was everyone out for a smoke break or something? Surely a warehouse of this size would be crawling with workers, at least ours was back at the company I worked for. Figuring everyone was out for a smoke break or at the very least, given the early morning, it was probably shift change, I decided to see if I could find an office of any kind to see if anyone could tell me where I was. I had briefly tried to consult Google Maps on my phone but I couldn't get any signal, likely due to being inside a large steel building. I eventually spotted some windows high up on a wall on the other side of the warehouse and figured that must be the office. As I walked towards it I passed another forklift that looked like it had just been abandoned in the middle of putting a pallet of electronic equipment up on a rack. Just like the other one the electric hum and position of the key indicated that it had been left on. A little farther up the aisle there was a golf cart with a little orange blinking light on top of it. It had crashed into one of the metal support columns holding up the roof of the warehouse and front end was completely destroyed. It just sat there light still blinking as I walked past it. What the hell was going on here? Was there some emergency I was unaware of? I was beginning to get the feeling the staff of this place had abandoned it in a hurry.

Eventually I reached a set of metal stairs that led up to an enclosed mezzanine area that I thought had to be the office. I climbed the stairs and opened the door to find the room completely empty. It was indeed an office but instead of the loud atmosphere I was used to at work it was dead silent. I slowly walked through the rows of cubicles taking note of the steam coming off a coffee cup on one of the desks. People had been here recently. The most telling sign of all though was that every single computer was logged in and open on some excel sheets or software that I didn't recognize. I may not have known a lot about forklifts but I did know a lot about office computers. They time out after 5 minutes or so automatically and go to sleep. When you wake them up again you have to enter your password again. If these computers were logged in it meant that their users couldn't have gone far or been gone for long.

Figuring now that something must really be wrong I quickly scanned the room and found a door with a glowing red exit sign above it. I didn't know how I'd gotten here but the people who worked here had clearly left in a hurry and I wasn't going to stick around to find out why. I ran through the office and tore open the exit door revealing a long hallway. I ran down the the hallway towards another exit sign and just kept repeating the process through door after door until suddenly I was blasted with cold air and snow as I found myself standing in what appeared to be a parking lot. It had clearly been snowing heavily but the blizzard was starting to clear and the morning light was beginning to shine through the snow, although the light was extremely dim and I couldn't actually see the sun in the sky yet. Where the hell was I? It hadn't snowed like this anywhere near Toronto or my home in Newmarket since, well, ever that I can remember.

My awe of the snow was short lived however as I heard the door click shut behind me. My heart sank as I realized it was locked and it looked like it had a keycard reader to open it again. I was wearing a light winter jacket over my usual business suit but it was not sufficient for the weather I now faced. I could hear an engine running from around the corner of the building so I began trudging through to snow towards it. My fancy dress shoes and suit pants becoming instantly soaked as I made my way through knee deep snow. My feet stung with the cold but I didn't care, that engine sound meant someone had to be nearby and they could help me. Maybe it was a fire truck or an ambulance and they had come to deal with whatever disaster had befallen this frigid warehouse. Maybe I would find the office staff huddled around it. I should have known better.

As I came around the corner of the building I almost walked straight into a running snowblower. My efforts to stop myself caused me to fall backwards into the snow and I began to scramble backwards to get out of the way of the machine. Once I had gotten out of the way and gotten to my feet I realized that it wasn't moving. My heart sank again as I stared at the large John Deere tractor sitting in front of me. Much like the forklifts and golf cart I had seen inside the machine was just sitting there idling as if it had been abandoned in the middle of whatever its task was. In this case it looked like it was about halfway done clearing the parking lot. ""Great,"" I mumbled to myself. It seemed that everyone really was gone. At least if that thing had been running for a while the cab was probably warmed up and it could provide some shelter.

I approached the tractor cautiously as the large augers of the snowblower attachment were still spinning and I did not want to encounter those again. Once I was safely alongside however, I practically threw myself up the steps into the cab. The warmth of the heaters felt almost burning compared to the cold outside but I didn't care. It was better than freezing to death. I leaned back in the operator's seat and just lay there for a few seconds enjoying it. Then I noticed something peculiar. There were no footprints leading away from the machine. If the operator had abandoned it as recently as the rest of the complex had been abandoned then there should have been signs of them running away. The snow was also letting up and there was no way it had snowed enough in the 10 minutes or so I'd been in this strange place to fill in the footprints. Hell there should have been footprints everywhere if a large scale evacuation had taken place. Something strange was definitely going on here.

For the first time since my arrival however, I finally felt safe enough sitting in that tractor cab that I could survey my surroundings. The snow had now completely stopped and I could see that I was sitting next to a massive white building at the bottom of what appeared to be a giant open pit mining site. Rock walls rose up on all sides with a spiral roadway leading to the top. There was also a massive radio tower on top of the building that must have been at least 100 feet above the surface level. It appeared to be held up by cables running down to the rim of the giant pit. Seeing the tower I foolishly tried my phone again but there was still no signal. I stuffed it back in my pocket and continued to look around. From what I could tell it looked like this was some kind of research facility that had been built into an old diamond mine. My suspicions were quickly confirmed as I noticed a row of white pickup trucks with the words ""Summer Island Research Facility"" written on the doors and various departments such as security or maintenance written along the sides of the bed. Well at least now I knew where I was, just not where this place was.

As luck would have it there was a much more substantial winter jacket stuffed behind the seat of the tractor and inside one of the pockets was a keycard. With this maybe I could get back inside and formulate a plan to deal with my current situation. I put on the jacket and once again braved the cold and made my way back to the door I had come out of. The light on the door turned green as I tapped the keycard up against it and a loud clunk indicated it was now unlocked. I quickly stepped inside and furiously stomped my feet to try and get all the snow off my shoes and pants. I had a better coat now but I needed to find some boots and snowpants if I was going to go outside again. My new mission was now to find an employee locker room or something where I could find some gear. I wandered up an down the halls finding nothing but empty office after empty office. I was beginning to contemplate my situation more and I wondered if I had in fact rear ended that dump truck back on the 404 and died in a horrible car accident and if this was some kind of purgatory. Even though I had only been here an hour tops at this point my morning commute and even my life back in Newmarket seemed like a distant memory. Was all that even real? Or was this even real? I had no idea how I'd even gotten here and the more I thought about it the more questions I had.

Eventually I stumbled into a lab of some kind. I guessed that this was where the research at the Summer Island Facility took place. There was  lot of science equipment that I couldn't even begin to tell you what it was for scattered around the room and several computer desks all covered in papers. A large whiteboard in the corner of the room caught my attention. It was covered in what I guessed were mathematical equations but mixed in with the numbers were symbols I have never seen before. At the far end of the room was a large glass wall and on the other side of it was a device that slightly resembled a jet engine with the cowlings removed. ""Must be testing something for a new fighter plane,"" I thought to myself but as I drew closer I realized this was not an aircraft engine. The front end where the fan blades would be and the rear where the thrust would come out were capped off completely and what I initially thought were hoses turned out to be thick electrical cables. Every now and then sparks shot out of the machine but otherwise it was completely silent. Had thing thing malfunctioned somehow and that's why everyone left in such a hurry? I was fine so what could be so dangerous. Then a terrible thought struck me, what if this was nuclear and the whole place was irradiated?

I decided my best course of action at this point was to continue looking for the gear I needed then get as far away from this place as possible. While I knew that tractor was still running outside it was slow and I had no idea how to drive a tractor, I needed to find the keys to one of those trucks and get up to the surface and figure out where I was. Luckily for me the locker room was not far from the lab and by some stroke of luck there was a locker open. Judging by the same high-vis winter jacket I had found in the tractor that hung inside the locker this must have belonged to one of the maintenance workers. I took the matching snow pants, boots and gloves out and quickly put them on. Rummaging around a little more I managed to find a hat and some snow goggles as well. I probably looked like I was ready to climb Mount Everest but I guess in a way that's exactly what I was about to do. I found a set of car keys on one of the tables and quickly snatched them up looking them over and noticing the Ram Trucks logo on the side of the key fob. At least it wouldn't take long to figure out which vehicle these were for. So far I had only seen F-150s outside.

I pulled my goggles down over my eyes as I ventured back out into the cold. It was a little brighter out now but it still seemed way too dark for the time of day it should have been by now. I pressed the panic button on the key fob and heart a repeated car horn coming from around the opposite corner to where the tractor was. I followed the sound until I was around the corner of the building and looking at a big Dodge Ram dually truck with a camper in the bed. It was covered in all kinds of antennas and had some kind of radar system on the roof and a big moose bumper with a winch mounted on the front. It had the same ""Summer Island Research Facility"" lettering on the doors and the words ""Mobile Research Unit"" written on the camper that sat in the bed. I remember thinking of my coworker James who wouldn't shut up about his overlanding rig, an old Toyota 4Runner with a collapsible rooftop tent. This truck was his wet dream.

I silenced the alarm and unlocked the vehicle. Climbing into the driver's seat I noticed the interior of the truck looked like a police car. There was a laptop mounted to the center console and all kinds of radio and electronic equipment. There was what appeared to be a CB radio overhead which I turned on and quickly flipped through a few channels but heard nothing. I put the key in the ignition and while the big diesel engine wasn't happy about turning over in the cold it did start. I sat there and let the truck warm up for a minute or two before setting off out of the parking area. Thankfully although the tractor operator had only manged to clear the snow from half of the parking lot it appeared as though the spiral road heading up to the surface had been plowed. Even still it was slow going as I didn't want to slide off the edge and plummit back into the pit. 

It took about 15 minutes but I eventually reached the surface and stopped to survey the area. I put the truck in park and got out as if the windhshield was somehow lying to me about what was outside. For as far as I could see there was nothing but snow. Not a single tree in sight and although by this point it had to be at least 11AM and it was completely clear the sun was nowhere to be found in the sky. The only proof of its existence was the dim light coming from over the horizon that was allowing me to see. Was I in the fucking Arctic??? I let out a frustrated scream. What the hell was going on? I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Just hours ago I had been driving into downtown Toronto and now somehow inexplicably I was on the edge of a research facility at the North fucking Pole???

Off in the distance on top of a hill I could see lights in the direction that the road was heading. Maybe that's where everyone had gone and maybe I could get some answers there. I jumped back in the truck and took off down the bumpy road as fast as I could go in the snowy conditions. My excitement was short lived however as I arrived at the lights and realized they were landing lights for a small airstrip adjacent to the facility. I punched the steering wheel in frustration causing the horn to honk. I had heard there were places in the Arctic that were only accessable by plane. If this was one of them and everyone had gone then I truly was trapped up here. I shut the engine off and rested my head on the steering wheel. I'm a bit ashamed to admit it but I had a complete mental breakdown. I couldn't understand anything that was going on and now I was trapped in one of the most hostile places on earth with no way home.

My wallowing in self pity was short lived as I suddenly heard the sound of an approaching plane. I was overjoyed at the sound of this and immediately got out of the truck and began searching the skies for the incoming aircraft. Much like my self pity my feelings of joy were also short lived as I spotted the plane coming low on the horizon. It was moving far too quickly to be a commercial jet or military cargo plane. No there was only one thing that could be and it was a fighter plane. I don't know a lot about the military but they don't generally send fighter planes on rescue missions. At the same time as realization struck me that this was not the government coming to the rescue but rather a coverup for whatever happened here, the plane fired a single missile at the edge of the massive pit. From my vantage point on the hill by the airstrip I saw it collide with the rock wall and explode sending rock and ice flying into the air. Then what I had initially assumed was solid ground began to collapse into the pit revealing itself to be a frozen body of water. Within seconds the pit was flooded and the impact from the wave pancaked the building and sent the communications tower collapsing to the bottom of the newly formed lake. The plane circled around again heading for the airstrip. I dove back into the truck and hoped the white vehicle would blend in with the snow enough not to be seen by the pilot. It did, or at the very least the pilot didn't think it necessary to destroy a stationary vehicle. The plane fired off one more missile cratering the runway and then flew off again disappearing over the horizon. 

I peeked up over the steering wheel as the last few pieces of rock came down denting the hood of the truck. There was now no way for anyone to even land to come save me but that was the least of my problems. Whatever was going on the government clearly didn't want it getting out. If I was found I would probably be shot on sight even though I had nothing to do with it. My best bet was to get as far away from this place as possible and then try to seek help. My only problem was I still had no idea where I was and all I had was this truck. If there were no roads out of here I was screwed. There probably were snowmobiles in that facility somewhere and I was kicking myself for not trying to find one before the facility got destroyed. Out of desparation I opened the laptop mounted to the truck's console and found that shockingly it was not locked with a password. It seemed this latop served only for navigation but that was fine with me as that's exactly what I needed. Even more shockingly it did appear to have a connection to some kind of satelite system and from that I was able to pull up a map and finally saw where I was. 

I was indeed in the Arctic Ocean on an island roughly 30 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories. My heart sank upon this realization. If I was on an island then that airstrip really was the only way in or out. If the base hadn't been destroyed I might've been able to survive up here till spring and found a boat or something once the ice melted but it was gone now and I definitely couldn't survive in this truck. Wait a minute, the ice, that was it! The water was frozen over between here and the mainland if I could make it across then I might be able to find help in Tuktoyaktuk. It was a longshot but I had to try. I quickly took stock of the supplies I had in the truck then checked out the camper sitting in the bed. There wasn't much, just a bunch of unhelpful science equipment, a few basic tools, some shovels, and some extra fuel cans which were thankfully full. I tossed all the science equipment out of the back into the snow and tried to make the inside of the camper look as civilian as I could. There were still beds and basic living amenities in there under all the research stuff so I was hopeful I could make it look like just an ordinary truck camper. I then set to work peeling off the vinyl decals and truck numbers and anything else that could tie this vehicle to the facility. I also removed the patches with the facility's logo from all of the winter gear I had stolen. I needed the laptop and radar antennas for navigation but told myself I would ditch those too once I was in sight of the settlement. I had heard the Dempster Highway had been extended to Tuktoyaktuk in 2017 so it was finally connected to the rest of Canada's roads. I could drive south into British Columbia if I made it there but I had to be sure the truck couldn't be easily identified.

I was impressed with how well the truck handled the deep snow as I pushed my way towards the shoreline. I knew any minute I could get stuck and that would be the end but I kept going. It was nerve wracking pulling out on to the ice and I half expected to just immediately break through. I had seen enough Ice Road Truckers on the History Channel to know to take my seatbelt off and drive slow as to not create a pressure wave and crack the ice so I crept along barely going above 40 kilometres an hour. This was a lot different than Ice Road Truckers though. Ice roads are actually maintained it's not like they're just driving on untamed ice, like I was doing right now. It was bumpy and the I could hear the ice shifting and cracking under me as I crossed over the uneven sections. I was sure I was going to break through but after about 2 hours of driving over the uneven ice I saw the lights of Tuktoyaktuk in the distance. I stopped the truck and climbed onto the roof and ripped off the radar antenna then tore out the laptop mount from the cab and took off towards the town. I contemplated going to the locals for help but figured that would only get me arrested so I only stopped briefly for fuel then took off down the long lonely highway headed south. Bob, the guy who ran the gas station was confused as he hadn't seen me come to town but didn't ask too many questions.

I only made one other stop in Inuvik for more fuel but besides that I made it pretty much all the way to Whitehorse in the Yukon in one go. By this point I had been on the road for almost 24 hours straight and was exhausted and needed to rest. I decided to ditch the truck just outside Whitehorse and walk into town and find a room for the night posing as a tourist. Whitehorse had an airport and I could fly home from there the next day. I found an old logging road to hide the truck down. I contemplated setting it on fire but I knew that would draw too much attention so I just abandoned it in the trees, gathered my things and made the hour walk into Whitehorse. My night at the bed and breakfast there was the best sleep I had had in days but sadly I was woken up early the next morning by my phone ringing. I had forgotten I'd even had a phone since over the past few days it had been all but useless to me.

""Hello?"" I sad groggily into the phone. ""Mr. Richards this is Sargeant Powell with the Ontario Provincial Police we have been trying to reach you for the past 2 days."" Said the voice on the other end of the phone. I immediately stiffened up. ""What for?"" I asked, assuming I had been reported missing. ""About the accident you caused at the interchange of the 404 and the 401 on Monday, you rear ended a dump truck and then swerved into the other lane where your car was rear ended by a minivan causing a 50 car pileup. 11 people are dead and many more were injured. We could not locate you at the accident so you have been presumed to have fled the scene on foot which is a very serious offence."" The officer continued. I had almost forgotten that I had been driving to work before all this started. Part of me thought that maybe I had lost some memory or something but from what the cop was telling me it seemed like I had, no that's crazy... There's no way I somehow teleported from the GTA to the Canadian Arctic... But then again that did seem to be what had happened... ""Well I certainly hope you have the wrong person officer,"" I said into the phone trying to regain my composure. ""You see, I'm in Whitehorse in the Yukon right now, visiting my aunt,"" obviously I was not going to tell him why I was really up there, ""so if my car was involved in an accident then it must've been stolen."" ""Is that so Mr.Richards,"" the cop said in a tone that I could tell meant he didn't believe me. ""Well if you have any proof of this I'm going to need it as soon as you return.""

Upon landing at Toronto Pearson Airport I was immediately taken into custody by the police. They did not believe my story of visiting my aunt in the Yukon at all but had to led me go as it was a pretty rock solid alibi and all the receipts from my stay there and my flight home. I just claimed I lost my ticket for the flight there. After my release I fully expected my house to get raided by the SWAT team or something and I'd be hauled in for questioning about my involement in whatever happened at the mysterious base but nothing ever came of it. It seemed the police were really only interested in the car accident and the higher levels of government had no idea I'd ever been up there. My insurance reluctantly paid for a new car and everything went back to more or less normal. Somehow my job didn't even notice I was gone so I still got paid for those days and went back to work as if nothing had happened.

The only problem is, now I know that crazy stuff like this is possible. I don't know what the government was messing around with up there or what happened to all the people at that base, and I'm not sure I want to know. Either way knowing that it's possible to just get plucked out of existence and reappear in another place entirely often leaves me sitting awake late at night wondering if and when it might happen again.",2,1730427683.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

In the past we discussed living part time in both of our cities (mine in NE, his northern Florida), or moving to North or South Carolina. In recent months, my boyfriend decided that he wants to live full time (with me) in Florida and he would not be happy living elsewhere.

I have spent months at a time in his town and I have reservations about moving there. When I am there the days go by very slowly. My company does not have an office there so I have to work from home. While some people love working remotely, I feel a lack of purpose and productivity.

I also do not like warm weather. I get cranky when it’s too hot and have pale skin so I don’t enjoy being in the sun. The beach is beautiful to me, but only to walk on or take a swim.The days feel monotonous - yay, it’s sunny AGAIN. I am a jeans and hoodie girl, not shorts and a tank.

When I am there I miss my siblings who all live in my NE city. I am scared that if we have kids and separate, I will be stuck in FL. 

My bf argues that anything I like to do - go to yoga, paint, get coffee, etc, I can do in FL. He also says I will get used to the heat and northern florida experiences coldness. His other argument is that I do not even see my family that much anyway, and that it is somewhat pathetic to live and die within a 2 hour of where you were born. (Context his family relocated to FL). 

I am so nervous my hair is falling out. I love my boyfriend so much that I am scared that I will never find love like this again. He is funny, intelligent, and handsome. Not to be corny, but a bright light in my life. What should I do?",3,1730427198.0,makemychoice,8,1.0,False

1ggv41i,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1ggv41i/26_year_old_doctor/,26 year old doctor ,"Now I’m going to preface this by saying I know how lucky I am to be in my profession. But lately it’s all too much.

I come from a very working class migrant family, from as long as I can remember they encouraged me to go into medicine, it was their dream, I was young and didn’t know any better. Who really knows that they want to be a doctor at 14? Anyway, roll on the years and I get into medical school, it was amazing, I had the best 5 years and made the closest of friends, I even met my current partner who is my rock (together for 3 years).

I have poured my heart and soul into this profession, every fibre of my being, my entire childhood and the first half of my twenties. Working. Days, nights, weekends. Sacrificing it all to become a doctor, chasing this dream that was never mine. I’m here now, I’ve just finished my second year of work, and I am so lost. My friends have all moved on to different cities, seemingly connecting with others better than me. I stayed in the same city I studied in (where my partner is based). I can’t help nudging this feeling that I haven’t moved on, I walk the city after a set of nights, delirious, feeling like a total stranger and passing buildings where I once had happy memories. Now I see a friend once every few months if I’m lucky. My whole social world has collapsed, I can’t remember the last time I saw a friend for dinner, a coffee, a drink. Because of shift work, I spend most weekends alone and most days roaming around, filling the time endlessly. 

The career that i am provides little comfort, the constant and relentless battle to further my training, coupled by the fear of being flung around the country with no stability adds to this feeling of misery, I don’t know what I’m doing, I don’t know if I’d be happier leaving the profession for something more stable and social.

I can’t say I love what I do, is it too late to find something else? ",0,1730426765.0,findapath,6,0.4,False

1ggv2qx,https://i.redd.it/fvvedrst67yd1.jpeg,Was asked to do an update on my golf goals and got my reminder today,"I guess I’ll just tackle these item by item, but I want to say it was a great season, my first as a member anywhere. 

For context, I played somewhere between 175-200 rounds, three a days on weekends often, and through the week as much as possible. My life was the golf course when I wasn’t working. My course plays about 6000yds from my tees, municipal track. There are few flat lies anywhere, some good elevation changes. Greens are a moderate speed but there are heavy undulations and slopes. 

1) I really went into this season with a great attitude. And I really did feel I was the happiest most grateful player on the course at any time for a while. But what I thought was my biggest strength going into the year, quickly became my biggest nightmare. I usually can’t wait to pull driver every day, but I ended up taking it out of the bag completely, and turned out I had bigger issues with irons shortly thereafter. It became quite a grind after a while and it was hard to feel good about going to the golf course. I made some changes and was able to get back to my old self. I would say I was able to achieve this for MOST of the year, but I did let results dictate my mindset for a while and that was kind of the whole point of this goal was to be happy regardless of what’s going on out there. This might have been my loftiest goal looking back, this is a tough thing to attain and requires a higher spiritual understanding than I’ll ever have. 

2) whew, boy. I genuinely thought I was going to be able to avoid the 90s. That was bold of me. Only a handful of times, though. But believe when I say I had to grind to avoid a few more.

3) no double bogeys three time was a KILLER, though I’m very proud at how few I’m allowing a round these days. Having two such rounds already, a friend of mine Joel played with me two Sundays in a row and watched me botch it on 18 each time a little over a month ago. Scored great in those rounds but gosh those were buckling ends to rounds. The first time it was totally a mental thing, I was thinking about it no doubt. The second time I just didn’t make the putt, it was what it was. But I was able to lock this one down last week with a double free 75, tying my lowest round of the year. 

4) lol

5) got off to a tough start to this one. Not having a driver in the bag and relying on a 2i put a TON of stress on my iron game and birdie opportunities just weren’t coming like I needed them to. Eventually I went and got some data, and made an equipment change that reversed my golf season. Moved back to a JumboMax grip on driver and I can impress on you enough the immediate change. I was absolutely slamming the door on my driver and this was literally an overnight game changer. Birdies started rolling in, wedges have always been a strength in my game as well as putting and just having more birdie putts logically turned into more birdies. I set a personal best of four birdies in nine holes the other day. What a feeling. Proud to tick this one off. 

6) competed solo for the first time in our club championship. I was thinking I’d finish decently but only EIGHT men signed up for the championship, which is played with no HCP, and looking at the names now I’m just hoping I don’t finish in last. I did not. Mission accomplished. Low score of the day was a 68 from a 17 year old who will be heading down south after high school to the states on a scholarship, real nice player. Anyways, was nervous as hell, hit my first tee shot 70yds. Took a while to get my feet under me, that’s for sure. 

7) I made many more than three new friends this year, but I have to tell you about my favourite of the bunch. I met Terry when I was on the first tee, and he was coming off the ninth green. I had the tunes going, maybe a little louder than I should have, and I see this old dude marching over to me thinking he’s about to churn me out, and he starts dancing and singing. We were fast friends. At 73, he’s nearly forty years my senior but we get along a treat. And boy, I hope I’m swinging like Terry at 73. I was born in 1988, the same year Terry became a member. 

8) finding new courses to play around me isn’t the easiest tbh, I used to play a ton of different courses before I became a member this year. Last year I played 25 courses. Combine that with I just wanted to be at my track all the time this probably just wasn’t going to happen. Surprised I pried myself away for four new ones tbh. 

9) when I wrote the goal, I intended it to be no cigarettes, no doobies, no coffee, nothing. This just didn’t happen. 

10) the person I used to score from got out of the business 😭😭😭 I will be ticking this off the list one day.

1ggv14d,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1ggv14d/why_no_effort/,Why No Effort? ,"I [48M] dated this ""good girl"" [42F] for good three years. Known each other for five years. 

We met and chatted through the political social media. She voted for this and I voted for that, so we have kind of political conflict and agreed not to bring politics into dinner and bed. 

Within a month of video calls, text, etc, we decided to meet each other in person. Just for the weekend.

First hour in, she shifting my stick while driving. Pulled my pants right off me as soon as she locked her door. 

Everything was fantastic and all that. It's seems like we were the match because we knows ourselves too well.  

We agreed to treat it as an one night stand and we aren't so much into the long distance. 

Before I fly back home, she got upset and told me she never had a feeling like this because I treated her too good, shown how a lady should be treated and such. ""You brought a woman out of me and I never have anything like that. You gave me the sexual awakening!"" She told me that and I remembered everything she said and what we did together. She was total college ho and I was way too college incel. 

Anyway, she called me porn star stud because I shown her more surprising positions than anybody ever could. 

We still agreed to one night stand, nothing more than that. Well, I ended up flying back to her again. And again. AGAIN! 

Until we had our fallout due to politics and she got mad at me. I felt like she dumped me, so I moved on. 

One year and half later, she contacted me out of blue, got me on video call with her and we just talked very good, eventually turned into cyber sex. 

She asked me if I'm seeing anyone and I said no. I asked her if she wanted another chance and she said yes. 

I flew back to her again. Again. AGAIN! It took guts out of me but I decided to ask her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. I was afraid she would rejected me. 

I told her that only way LDR would work if she make an effort to strike a conversation with me, initiated the first move on her part and she should visit me as much as she can and I will do the same thing. 

She promised me she will do her best. 3 years later, she never make any effort and I just decided to called it off after she promised me she would visit me next week and she never did. I guess I got fed up with her BS. 

I do know she cares a lot about me, she was happy to have me as her boyfriend... She even asked me to move in. I explained that I just can't move my whole life with her without get her to know MY life first. 

I don't want a situation where I moved in then found out she doesn't like my hobby or how I'm doing daily and then be kicked out for no reason. 

LDR is not that hard if both partners agreed to see each other and it isn't bad, she's only lives five hours away from me and it only takes one hour and half on a plane. We aren't kids anymore! 

When I see her, I always planned everything in advance. I felt like she is too afraid to visit me because of her son who doesn't even live with her. She have only one kid and I have six kids and I have tremendous solid family support, they will babysit my children every time I go out of town. 

Every time I asked when she will visit me, she always pulled up her son as an excuse... He is living with her ex-husband and his parents and she absolutely have nothing else to do except work all the way. Kept claiming she can't call work off but she doesn't work during the weekend. 

She got upset when I called her out for using me like that... She knew I spoiled the shit out of her, brought her a coffee maker and stuff. 

But she STILL would not visit me... Or keep in touch with me daily, even for the small talk. 

I do regretted for called it off but due to her inability to make a time to visit me in five years... I'm not even sure if I did the right thing because there's nobody like her. She is rare gem and I'm man of patience.

**Name**

'The 8.2 Seconds Rule'

**My summary:**

Koichi Amai is a high school student and a talented sweets chef. He hears that if you maintain eye contact with your crush for 8.2 seconds, you can make him fall in love with you. There are 5 episodes, and in each of them, Koichi has a crush on a different boy, and tries to win his heart. But does he succeed in any of the cases?

This short and 'sweet' series combines two much-loved themes -- high school and food! And Koichi has a mildly naughty fantasy about each of his crushes! You'll also recognize actors from other JBL and JDramas.

**Where to watch:**

Links to each episode are below. Note that each of these starts with a commercial ad with two girls for a hair-removal service called 'Musee Platinum', so don't be surprised by that.

I have been prescribed lanzoprazole for 4 years for issues with stomach acid reflux. I have also been prescribed sertraline for depression, I has to stop due to two seizures I had that I am currently under diagnosis with neurology. 

I  ( cis24f) haven't had issues with allergies growing up at all. I understand as an adult tolerances change and we can become intolerant to new or existing foods. 

However, in the last 6 months, I feel extremely tired (have taken iron tablets) and agitated my fuse is extremely short, I wake up through the night to wee so never feel like I've had a full night's rest. My brain has always felt like a lump of clay and I have horrendous brain fog and memory problems but it seems to have worsened. 

 In addition to this, raw bell peppers, raw banana, raw grapes, grapefruit,  and garlic have started causing my mouth to experience almost pins and needles, and with the garlic I get intense stomach acid. 

I am overweight 5ft 1 11stone  but losing it, I mainly eat homemade soup, salads,greek yogurt and berries etc, but I also am In an extremely bad habit of having coffee with sugar about 5times a day at work, so have about 10-15 tsps sugar daily dropping from about 35tsp daily (I know it's a lot) .

All episodes are available on the Starray Drama Channel on YouTube, with subtitles! The subtitles are not the best quality, but at least we do have them! Turn on the 'CC' thing on your video settings.

**Name**

'The 8.2 Seconds Rule'

**My summary:**

Koichi Amai is a high school student and a talented sweets chef. He hears that if you maintain eye contact with your crush for 8.2 seconds, you can make him fall in love with you. There are 5 episodes, and in each of them, Koichi has a crush on a different boy, and tries to win his heart. But does he succeed in any of the cases? 

This short and 'sweet' series combines two much-loved themes -- high school and food! And Koichi has a mildly naughty fantasy about each of his crushes! You'll also recognize actors from other JBL and JDramas.

  
**Where to watch:**

Links to each episode are below. Note that each of these starts with a commercial ad with two girls for a hair-removal service called 'Musee Platinum', so don't be surprised by that.

1. Sherwin Williams does a FREE color consultation, which helped us land on this color that really pulls the grays out of the quartz. 
2. I briefly planned on redoing the floor... And then I degreased and holy smokes it's an entirely different color!
3. Go for the better sprayer... Tried doing this with a cheap sprayer off Amazon... One day in and I was losing my mind. Splurged on a mid tier Graco and things went much more smoothly after that. Well worth my sanity.

Psychology major, sharp jaw, always carrying a battered, highlighted textbook under his arm. To him, I was just background—another half-smiling face in the mass of campus strangers.

But I watched him. I was drawn to his confidence, the way he leaned forward when he talked, like he wanted to dissect people’s words, peer inside their minds. And that casual smile—it was natural on him. He probably had no idea how that smile felt to people like me, people who lived on the edges, unseen. A glint of warmth on a cold day. For me, that smile was a flickering flame.

The little occult shop in town was the type that pulled at you with its own quiet gravity. Its shelves sagged with oddities: dried herbs, jars of something that looked like crystallized spiders, tarot cards with edges worn soft by years of handling. I’d been browsing in there since freshman year. Mostly I looked, rarely bought. The owner, an older woman with eyes that lingered too long, didn’t care.

That day, though, I found the book—a cracked, dust-coated, leather-bound thing stuffed under a stack of crumbling grimoires. “Charms and Potions to Influence the Heart.” I nearly laughed at it, but I flipped through the pages, my fingers staining just from touching it. There, between brittle sheets and smeared ink, was the love potion spell. Irresistible allure, it claimed, with warnings written faintly in cursive in the margins. I shrugged them off. Desperation drives people to warnings, but what did they mean to someone who didn’t plan on taking them seriously? Besides, I wasn’t desperate. I was curious.

The instructions were straightforward, even for a first-timer. A few herbs, some strange Latin incantation. Nothing I hadn’t tried in simpler forms. But one detail felt... unnecessary. The book advised a personal “cleansing” ritual before crafting the potion, to “prevent the caster’s own desires from tainting the charm.” I scoffed at the idea. My desires weren’t dangerous—maybe a little silly, maybe stupid, but not dangerous. So I skipped it, brushing it aside as some medieval quirk.

Back in my apartment, the kitchen reeked of thyme, rosemary, and something called *witch’s lavender*, a cloying scent somewhere between licorice and death. I ground the herbs in my mortar and pestle, feeling each hard crush of the stone, then mixed the powder with honey and a drop of my own blood—a required “personal touch.” The whole concoction gleamed dark red in the dim light, the color of a bruise. Thick, syrupy, almost alive in the jar. I held it to my nose, inhaling that odd mix of bitterness and sweetness, and felt a small thrill tighten in my chest.

The next day, there was a campus event in the courtyard—some tedious student fair with free coffee on a long table lined with dusty thermoses. Jeremy was there, chatting with friends near the theater club’s booth, coffee cup cradled in his hands. Perfect.

I slipped the vial out of my coat pocket, popping the cork as inconspicuously as I could. The potion trickled out in a thin stream, nearly black, sinking into the coffee like oil in water. I stirred it quickly with the plastic stir stick, looking around, heartbeat quickening, but no one was paying attention. Why would they?

Then I watched him drink. Watched him talk with that effortless laugh and casual shrug, watched the coffee cup go up to his mouth, the potion slipping past his lips. I had to pull my eyes away so no one noticed. And then, I waited.

It wasn’t immediate—no magic spark, no grand revelation. But over the next few days, things shifted. I’d pass him in the library, and he’d do a double-take, that small flash of recognition in his eyes, like he was recalling a dream. And then he’d smile, half-confused, but a little longer than usual. Once, as he left the library, he turned back, lingering by the door as if he had something to say, his eyes finding mine through the glass.

At first, the thrill of it made me dizzy. It was like touching fire without getting burned, like I’d somehow altered the air around me just by saying I would. By wanting it.

The first time Jeremy showed up outside my class, I thought it was coincidence. Just him leaving the lecture hall next door. He walked up to me, an easy smile spreading across his face like I was someone he’d known all along.

“Hey, Emma, right?”

The sound of my name from his mouth was like an electric jolt. He said it like he’d practiced it, testing out the shape of each syllable. I managed a nod, feeling my cheeks heat up.

“I thought I recognized you from the library.” He laughed, an awkward chuckle, his hand rubbing the back of his neck. “You have this focused look, you know? Makes me wonder what you’re always reading about.”

His gaze lingered a second too long. “Uh, yeah,” I stammered. “I read a lot. For class and...other things.”

There was a spark in his eyes as he asked what I was studying, what I liked to do, if I’d want to grab coffee sometime. He seemed genuinely interested—too interested, maybe. And I found myself overwhelmed, almost uncertain. But I agreed. Because, after all, wasn’t this what I’d wanted?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Over the next few days, I started seeing him everywhere. He’d pop up when I was leaving the library, or walking to class, or at the café where I went to unwind. He acted surprised each time, always chuckling, like, *“What are the odds?”*

It was thrilling, that first week—like I’d somehow summoned him from a distance. But soon, his presence became a constant shadow I couldn’t shake.

One evening, I was sitting on my dorm’s front steps, headphones in, hoping for a quiet moment to myself. Then a shadow loomed over me. I glanced up, startled, and there he was, standing inches away, grinning down at me.

“You’re hard to find, you know that?” he said, his eyes locked onto mine, unblinking. “I tried to catch you in the library today.”

I pulled out an earbud, forcing a laugh. “Didn’t realize I had a schedule to keep.”

He didn’t laugh. He just kept watching, his gaze heavy. “Just saying it’d be nice if you made a little more time for me.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A few days later, Lily started noticing too. She was my roommate, my one friend on campus who knew my quirks and obsessions, though she only teased me for them. But the morning she saw Jeremy waiting outside our building, she raised an eyebrow.

“That guy again?” she asked, peeking through the blinds as he lingered by the entrance. “Is he always around, or is it just me?”

I tried to play it off. “We’re just...getting to know each other.”

She gave me a hard look. “Emma, getting to know each other is one thing. Having a guy stalk you is another.”

“He’s not stalking me, Lily. He’s just...he’s into me, I guess.”

She shook her head, closing the blinds with a sigh. “Just be careful, okay? He seems a little...intense.”

Intense. I brushed it off, but the word clung to me. That night, I felt my skin prickle as I realized how often his face flashed in my thoughts, how his gaze felt more like a lock than a look.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next evening, as I walked back from class, I felt a presence behind me. Quick, light footsteps, then a familiar voice.

“Emma.”

I turned. Jeremy was standing just a step away, close enough that I felt his breath, sharp and shallow.

“Hi,” I managed, forcing a smile. “Didn’t realize you’d be here.”

He reached out, his hand brushing my arm, holding just long enough that I felt pinned in place. “You didn’t text me back.”

I stammered, trying to explain about assignments, a long day—but he didn’t let go. His grip tightened, his fingers pressing into my skin.

“I just don’t get it,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, his face inches from mine. “I thought we were...special.”

“Jeremy, you’re hurting me,” I said, tugging my arm free. For a second, a strange light flashed in his eyes—a brief, angry spark—but then he released me, his hand falling limp by his side. He muttered an apology, his eyes trailing me even as I hurried away.

When I got home, Lily was already there, tapping away on her laptop. She looked up when I came in, her expression softening as she saw my flushed face and the red marks on my arm.

“What happened?”

“Nothing,” I lied. “Just...Jeremy.”

“Emma, this is getting weird. You need to tell him to back off.” She bit her lip, worry creasing her forehead. “Or I will.”

I waved her off, embarrassed, but a part of me was relieved she noticed. Maybe I wasn’t overreacting. Maybe he was going too far. But I’d tell him myself, I thought. I didn’t want to make it worse.

The next morning, I woke to a quiet apartment. Lily’s bed was empty, her things untouched. I assumed she’d left early, maybe went to the library or for a run, though she was usually one to leave a note. I texted her once, twice. No response.

By evening, worry settled heavy in my chest. I tried her phone again, hearing only the hollow rings on the other end. I called a few friends, checked the library, even the student center. No one had seen her all day.

Then, around midnight, I heard a knock. Faint, almost hesitant. I opened the door, half-hoping to see her there with some explanation. But it was Jeremy.

His face was shadowed, his eyes rimmed with something dark, like he hadn’t slept. “Hey, Emma. Been waiting to talk to you.” His voice was calm, too calm, but something in his expression—too soft, too careful—made my stomach twist.

I tried to shut the door, but he pushed against it, forcing his way in. “Where’s Lily?” I blurted out, fear breaking through my voice.

“Gone,” he said simply, like it was an obvious fact, a truth as solid as the walls around us. “She was...in the way.”

A wave of nausea hit me. I wanted to scream, to run, but my legs felt frozen, rooted to the spot. Jeremy stepped closer, his face uncomfortably close, his breath hot against my cheek.

“I don’t want anyone else,” he whispered. “Just you, Emma. Only you.”

I didn’t know where else to go. After that night with Jeremy, his face too close, his words slipping over me like a dark fog, the only thought I had was *get help*.

Professor Grayson had always been friendly, almost fatherly, with his students. He taught my introductory psych course last year, and I remembered the way he’d lean against the podium, speaking about human behavior with a steady, thoughtful tone that made complex topics seem less intimidating. I’d hoped he’d still have that tone when I told him about Jeremy.

The next morning, I found him in his office, hunched over a stack of papers, reading glasses perched on the tip of his nose. He looked up, surprised, when I knocked, but his expression softened as I stepped in.

“Emma? Something on your mind?” His voice was gentle, a rare calm in the spinning chaos of my life right now.

I sank into the chair across from him, feeling the weight of everything pressing down on me. I didn’t know where to start, so I just... started. I told him about Jeremy. How I’d felt a thrill when he’d first noticed me, how that thrill had quickly twisted into something else, something suffocating and terrifying. I told him about Lily, about how she’d disappeared, about Jeremy’s last words to me. As I spoke, I could see Professor Grayson’s expression harden, lines forming at the corners of his mouth.

When I finished, he sat quietly, processing, before finally speaking. “Emma, this sounds like a situation you can’t ignore.” He took off his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “I know this is difficult, but... I think you need to take this seriously. Have you gone to the police?”

The word *police* hit me like a splash of cold water. I hadn’t thought of it—some part of me still wanted to handle it alone, to keep this hidden, as if speaking it aloud would make it real.

“I don’t know, Professor... He’s just... He’s just so good at talking his way out of things,” I stammered. But as I heard myself, I realized how flimsy it sounded. How could I expect anyone to help me if I didn’t even try?

Grayson nodded slowly, leaning forward. “Emma, listen. There’s a possibility here that his feelings for you have become obsessive, and that’s something that needs professional attention. If he’s as clever as you say, he may try to manipulate the situation. But you have to report it. Otherwise, you’re the one without protection.”

I felt a prickle of fear, and a desperate sort of relief. “Okay,” I whispered, barely loud enough to hear. “I’ll go.”

The police station was a maze of buzzing phones, murmured voices, and the soft shuffle of papers. I felt small in that space, as though every set of eyes knew my secrets, saw the tangle of regret and guilt I carried in my chest.

After a short wait, an officer named Michaels led me into a room with pale walls and flickering lights. He was younger than I expected, with sandy blond hair and a thin smile that never quite reached his eyes.

“Miss Graves, you reported a concern about someone named Jeremy?” His voice was calm, patient, as he opened his notepad, ready to jot down what he probably thought was another college drama.

“Yes,” I said, steadying my voice. “Jeremy—he’s... he’s been following me, showing up everywhere. He’s been... intense. And my roommate... she disappeared. The last time I saw her, she’d confronted him. He... he said she was ‘in the way.’”

Michaels’ pen scratched across the page, his face unreadable. “Did you see him do anything directly to her?”

I hesitated, the words tangled in my throat. “No... but I think he... he must’ve done something. She wouldn’t just leave, not without telling me.”

He nodded slowly, watching me. “Do you have any evidence, Miss Graves? Texts? Threats? Anything specific he’s done that could back this up?”

“No,” I whispered, hating the smallness of my voice. “But he... he’s always there, everywhere I go, like he’s watching me. And he... he told me I was the only one for him. That he didn’t want anyone else around me.”

Michaels jotted down a few more notes, nodding in that patient, skeptical way that made my skin crawl. I could almost feel his judgment, the doubt coiling in the room between us. He promised to “look into it,” but the tight set of his mouth told me all I needed to know. To him, I was just a girl spinning a story, maybe jealous, maybe paranoid. My words felt flimsy, insubstantial as they floated away from me, and I knew they weren’t enough to convince him.

The call came a couple hours later. Officer Michaels. His tone was flatter than before, and he didn’t waste time with pleasantries.

“Miss Graves,” he began, “I wanted to follow up on your report. My partner and I spoke with Mr. Fields, and he had a lot to say about you.”

My grip on the phone tightened. A lot to say about me?

Michaels continued, “Mr. Fields indicated some... concerns about your recent behavior. He said he felt you’d been following him, contacting him excessively, and—” Michaels cleared his throat, “—making unfounded accusations.”

I stood there, the silence pressing down around me like a shroud. “That’s... that’s not true,” I managed, but my voice sounded thin, barely there.

“Miss Graves, Mr. Fields was remarkably cooperative,” Michaels replied, the clipped edge to his voice as sharp as a knife. “He’s expressed that he’s worried for your well-being.”

My head spun. Worried for my well-being. I knew I shouldn’t be surprised. Jeremy had the kind of charm that disarmed you before you even realized it was happening, but the words hit like stones. “So you don’t believe me?” The question slipped out, edged with a desperation I hated hearing in my own voice.

Michaels hesitated, then let out a slow sigh. “We take all reports seriously. But Mr. Fields provided a different perspective. He even mentioned that he feels you may have... projected certain feelings onto him. That maybe, you felt hurt when he didn’t reciprocate. His story was... consistent.”

The words hit me with a nauseating clarity. Jeremy had spun it perfectly—turned me into the unhinged one. “I know what I saw, Officer Michaels,” I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. “He’s been following me, showing up everywhere I go. And my roommate, Lily, she—”

“Mr. Fields told us about your roommate,” Michaels cut in. “He said she left abruptly after a disagreement between the two of you. And there’s no evidence to suggest anything otherwise.”

I felt my grip slipping, a cold panic crawling up my spine. “But... she wouldn’t just leave. Not like that. She didn’t tell me anything, and I haven’t heard from her. Please, you have to understand—”

“Miss Graves, we understand that you’re upset,” Michaels said, his voice softening slightly, like he was speaking to a child. “But we can’t pursue further action unless there’s concrete evidence or a clear threat. Mr. Fields expressed genuine concern for you. He’s offered to back away if that’s what you need.”

I could almost hear the finality in his words, the practiced tone of dismissal. To them, this was resolved. My mind was made up, my side of the story a flimsy attempt to cover up jealousy or disappointment. I was losing ground, fast.

“Thank you for your time, Officer Michaels,” I said, forcing the words out, feeling them slip away like lifelines into an abyss.

“Take care of yourself, Miss Graves,” he replied, and then there was a click. The line went dead.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next morning, I went back to Professor Grayson’s office, not sure what I’d even say but knowing I had to tell someone. He listened as I explained what had happened with the police, his expression darkening with each word. When I finished, he shook his head, a pained look crossing his face.

“I’m so sorry, Emma. I can’t imagine how frustrating this must be.” His voice was steady, calming, but his face betrayed his frustration. “It’s disturbing, the way he’s manipulated this situation.”

“What do I do now?” The question fell out of me, half plea, half despair.

Grayson leaned forward, his eyes earnest. “You need to protect yourself, Emma. Be careful around him, avoid any direct confrontation if possible. If there’s any further escalation, the police will have to listen. They can’t ignore you forever.”

The room felt suddenly colder, the quiet stretching thin between us. His words should have been reassuring, but they only deepened the gnawing fear inside me. Jeremy had already drawn a line around me, shutting out anyone who might have helped. And now, with the police doubting my every word, I felt as if that line was tightening, closing in.

“Emma, you did the right thing by going to them. Even if they don’t see it now, you’ve planted the seed. If something else happens, they’ll be watching him.”

I nodded, swallowing hard, but the cold dread gnawed at me, a thick stone lodged in my stomach. Jeremy wasn’t just dangerous—he was cunning. And he knew how to twist things, bend reality until the truth no longer resembled itself.

Grayson leaned forward, lowering his voice, his gaze locking on mine. “Emma, stay vigilant. And don’t let your guard down around him, not even for a moment. Do you understand?”

I nodded again, but my hands were still trembling. I could barely process his words, the gravity of it all settling like lead in my bones. This was beyond anything I could explain away. I had created something that now existed outside of me, something I couldn’t control.

When I left Grayson’s office, my heart was heavy with a dread I couldn’t shake. Each step I took felt weighed down, as though Jeremy’s shadow had somehow rooted itself to me, stretching out of sight but never far behind.

I sat in my dorm room, staring at the empty space where Lily’s things used to be, feeling a hollow ache expand inside me. Jeremy had turned everything upside down with barely a handful of words. To the police, I was now the one in need of “help.” Jeremy was free, probably laughing to himself at how effortlessly he’d twisted the truth.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak and rustle outside my window sent jolts of fear through me, visions of Jeremy lurking just beyond the glass, that calm, calculating look in his eyes. The walls seemed to close in around me, the silence thick and suffocating.

I tried calling Lily’s phone again, the line ringing and ringing until her voicemail kicked in, her cheerful voice echoing through the empty space. “Hey, it’s Lily! Leave a message, and I’ll get back to you soon!”

I didn’t leave a message. I knew I wouldn’t get a call back.

After my last meeting with Professor Grayson, I did my best to avoid Jeremy, ducking down side hallways, taking the long way home from class. But it was no use. He was always there, waiting with that quiet, intense stare that seemed to peel back layers I’d thought were hidden.

One night, as I was leaving the library, he stepped out from the shadows, his gaze heavy, lips parted like he’d been waiting hours just to say something.

“Emma,” he said, his voice soft, almost coaxing. “You don’t have to keep running from me. You know I’d never hurt you.” The words echoed my own thoughts—thoughts I’d whispered to myself late at night, trying to convince myself that he wasn’t dangerous, that I hadn’t brought this on.

“Please, just...leave me alone,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. But the fear in it was too real, and he must have heard it because he smiled, a slow, almost pitying smile.

“Emma,” he whispered, taking a step closer, “you know you can’t hide from what you feel. I know you better than anyone else. Better than you know yourself.”

The way he said it chilled me, as if he’d peeled that thought from somewhere deep inside my mind. How could he know those words, those exact words? I had never said them out loud. The thought scratched at my brain, a creeping paranoia sinking its claws into me.

Over the next few days, I saw him everywhere. If I walked out of my dorm, he’d be standing across the quad, his eyes following me even from a distance. If I ducked into the cafeteria, he’d sit a few tables away, watching with an expression that was both knowing and hungry, like he was waiting for me to break down, to finally acknowledge him.

I stopped eating in public, avoiding the places where he might show up. My nerves were fraying; I couldn’t focus, couldn’t sleep. His words, his gaze—each encounter chipped away at the edges of my thoughts until they didn’t feel like my own anymore. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was inside my head, that somehow, he knew my thoughts before I even did.

One afternoon, as I crossed the courtyard, he appeared beside me out of nowhere, slipping into step as if he’d always been there.

“You shouldn’t ignore what’s right in front of you, Emma,” he murmured, his voice barely a whisper. “You know, pretending I don’t exist won’t make this go away.”

I flinched, tightening my grip on my bag, quickening my steps. But he matched me easily, a shadow tethered to my own. The campus felt empty, the late hour lending an eerie silence to everything around us.

“Jeremy, I don’t know what you think this is, but whatever it is… it’s over,” I said, trying to inject steel into my voice.

“Is it?” he asked, sounding genuinely curious, as though I’d suggested something amusing, maybe even absurd. “You think walking a little faster will change anything? You think you can just wish me away, like some bad dream?”

I took a deep breath, willing myself to stay calm. “This isn’t real. Whatever you think is between us—it’s just... it’s just a mistake. A misunderstanding.”

He laughed softly, a sound too close to my ear. “A misunderstanding?” His voice was calm, almost indulgent. “Emma, you made this. You made *me*. And now you want to pretend it didn’t happen?”

*I made him*? 

I made him…

I forced myself to look at him, summoning every ounce of courage left in me. “You don’t know me, Jeremy. You’ve never known me.”

His expression shifted, a hint of something darker in his eyes as he leaned closer, his voice low. “I know you better than anyone. I know the parts of you no one else even sees.” He cocked his head, his gaze fixed on mine. “Tell me, when’s the last time anyone else paid attention to what you really wanted?”

My stomach twisted. “You’re… you’re twisting this,” I said, my voice wavering, but I held his gaze, refusing to back down. “Whatever you think you know, it’s a lie. It’s… it’s in your head.”

“You can run,” he said, a strange satisfaction in his voice, his eyes glinting. “But you’ll always end up here. You know that, don’t you? Back where it all began. With me.”

I felt my heart pounding, my legs aching to bolt, but his gaze held me in place. “No,” I whispered, voice trembling. “I’m not coming back to you. I never chose this.”

He stepped closer, so close that I could feel the warmth of his breath on my skin. “But you did, Emma,” he murmured, his voice soft, dangerous. “The minute you thought of me… the minute you wanted me.”

I swallowed hard, hating how my voice shook. “Wanting isn’t the same as this. This is twisted, it’s wrong. It’s a violation.”

Jeremy’s smile widened, a dark, almost pitying look in his eyes. “You can tell yourself that all you want. But you and I both know you’ve never wanted anything—*anyone*—as much as this.” His gaze pierced through me, his voice taking on a hint of mockery. “You can’t run from what’s already inside you.”

I could feel the ground slipping out from under me, my mind scrambling for an escape. But as he watched, that strange, knowing smile still on his face, I knew he’d already won this battle.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night, as I lay awake in my bed, I felt his words echoing through my head, dark tendrils wrapping tighter around my thoughts. I tried to shake them, to convince myself it was paranoia, but his voice was there, whispering my own fears back to me.

I couldn’t ignore it anymore. The only place I knew to turn was that old shop, the strange, dusty room where I’d first found the spellbook. Desperation had pushed me to the edge. I needed answers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The shop looked the same as ever. The shopkeeper was there, standing by the counter with that same unreadable expression, as though she’d expected me all along. Her eyes narrowed when she saw me, a slight curve of amusement at the corners of her mouth.

“Back so soon?” she asked.

I forced myself to speak, swallowing back the unease that tightened my throat. “The spell I cast... the one for attraction.” My voice sounded small, hesitant. “Something went wrong. He’s...he’s acting like he knows things I haven’t told him, like he’s reading my mind.”

The shopkeeper tilted her head, studying me. “Did you follow the instructions exactly?”

I hesitated, shame pooling in my gut. “Mostly,” I muttered. “But I thought... I didn’t think the precaution mattered *that* much.”

The shopkeeper’s eyes darkened, and she let out a long, low sigh. “You thought the cleansing was unnecessary,” she said, her voice more a statement than a question. Her gaze felt like it was burrowing into me, unearthing my mistake from where I’d buried it under excuses.

“It was... just a small detail,” I whispered, the words pathetic even to my own ears.

Her mouth twitched with a bitter amusement. “The cleansing was to protect you from yourself, to bind the spell to your intention alone. By skipping it, you left the connection open-ended, unguarded. A spell like that doesn’t stop at attraction, dear. It digs deeper, attaching itself to every thought, every suppressed feeling. It binds your psyche to theirs, an open channel.”

My stomach dropped, nausea twisting through me. An open channel. Jeremy wasn’t just watching me; he was reflecting back my own fears, insecurities, every dark thought I’d ever buried. *I’d* done this. I’d ripped open a door and given him free access to the deepest corners of my mind.

I took a shaky breath, my voice barely a whisper. “Is there a way to undo it?”

The shopkeeper’s gaze softened, but there was no pity in her eyes. “Once a bond is formed, it’s not easily broken. Bonds built on the mind and heart are strong. Sometimes... irreversible.” She leaned in closer, her voice low and steady. “But be warned: severing such a bond is no small thing. It can leave both parties... damaged.”

The weight of her words pressed down on me, the hopelessness settling in like a lead weight. There was no simple undoing, no easy fix. I had created something dark, something hungry, and now it was consuming me piece by piece.

As I left the shop, her words echoed in my head, each one sinking deeper, heavier. *Irreversible.* I’d taken a harmless crush and twisted it into something monstrous. And now I’d given Jeremy a foothold in my mind, and every step I took seemed to lead me further into his grasp.

The next day, Jeremy was waiting outside my building, leaning against the stone wall with a calm, patient smile. His eyes met mine, and there was a strange light in them, something sharp, unhinged. He took a slow step toward me, his gaze never leaving mine.

“You went to the shop,” he murmured, his voice low, almost gentle.

My blood ran cold. I hadn’t told anyone, hadn’t spoken it aloud. There was no way he could have known.

“What are you—”

He stepped closer, his voice soft and familiar, as though he was coaxing a confession out of me. “I know everything, Emma. I know what you think about at night, alone in your room. I know the secrets you keep from everyone else. I know because... you let me in.”

Each word sent a chill through me, a horrifying confirmation that he was bound to me in ways I hadn’t even realized. I felt stripped bare, exposed, every dark thought held up to the light.

I tried to back away, but he caught my wrist, his grip gentle but unyielding, his eyes locking onto mine.

“You and I,” he whispered, his voice soft but laced with something cold, “we’re the same. And no one can come between us, Emma. Not the police, not Grayson... not even you.”

My throat tightened, and I felt the edge of panic rise within me, a flood of helplessness I couldn’t shake. “Jeremy, this... this isn’t what I wanted.”

He tilted his head, a glint of amusement in his eyes, as though my fear only fueled his certainty. “Isn’t it? You wanted me, didn’t you? You wanted someone to see you, to be part of you. And here I am.”

I felt sick, a wave of nausea washing over me as I realized the truth. This was what I’d done—what I’d made of him, of us. He was my reflection, twisted and broken, but undeniably mine.

As I pulled my hand free, his smile widened, a slow, chilling curve of satisfaction.

“Don’t fight it, Emma,” he said, his voice like a shadow crawling over me. “You’re already too far in.”

I turned and fled, his laughter trailing behind me, echoing down the empty corridors. Each step pounded with the realization that this wasn’t some nightmare I could wake up from. I had bound us together, and the more I tried to resist, the tighter his grip seemed to grow, a thread weaving itself through the fabric of my mind.

And I knew, as his voice followed me into the silence, that there was no escape—not from him, and not from myself.

I hadn’t seen Professor Grayson since the night I’d gone to the occult shop, but his words had lingered, sharp reminders to stay vigilant, to protect myself. Jeremy’s presence was pressing in, a shadow I couldn’t shake. I knew Grayson was the only one who might understand, the only person I could trust with the truth.

When I reached his office that evening, the lights were off, the door ajar. A chill ran down my spine. “Professor?” I called softly, stepping inside. His desk was cluttered, books half-open, a mug overturned. It looked wrong, like he’d left in a rush.

I moved further into the office, the silence growing thicker. My gaze landed on a dark stain near the side of his desk, smeared across the floor. My stomach twisted as I took in the scene: his glasses, broken, beside what could only be—

A shadow loomed in the doorway, and I whipped around, heart hammering. Jeremy stood there, his gaze locked onto mine, a quiet intensity in his eyes. I stumbled back, bile rising as I realized he was blocking my only way out.

“Looking for Grayson?” His voice was soft, almost tender. “I told you, Emma. No one else matters. No one but us.”

Fear pulsed through me. I shoved past him, darting into the hall, my footsteps echoing in the empty corridor. Behind me, I heard his calm, measured footsteps. He wasn’t in a hurry. He knew he’d catch me.

Bursting out of the building, I ran toward the forest, the darkness closing in around me as I pushed through the thick underbrush. Jeremy’s footsteps grew louder, relentless. I could barely breathe, but I pressed on, desperation forcing me deeper into the trees.

The only thought anchoring me was escape, the fleeting hope that somehow, I’d lose him in the shadows. But his voice drifted through the trees, closer than it should have been.

“Emma,” he called softly, as if coaxing me back. “You can’t run from this. You know that.”

But I kept running, his voice a dark promise, echoing in the cold night air.

I stopped in a small clearing, the cold pressing in from all sides. Setting down the supplies, I knelt and arranged the candles in a circle, my hands shaking as I lit each one. The spellbook lay open before me, the words heavy on the page, almost pulsing with dark intent. This was the severance ritual—the one the shopkeeper had warned me about.

With Grayson gone, this was all I had left, my last desperate attempt to break the bond I’d unwittingly unleashed. I had no choice; Jeremy had taken everything—my safety, my thoughts, even my sense of self. Tonight, it would end, or it would consume me whole.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and began the incantation. The ancient words felt foreign and thick on my tongue, a strain as I forced them out. The candles flickered, and a cold wind swept through the clearing, wrapping around me like an unwelcome shadow. I could feel the bond resisting, trembling, refusing to break.

A prickle ran up my spine, the eerie feeling of being watched. I opened my eyes—and Jeremy stood there at the edge of the clearing, his face cast in the eerie light of the flames. He looked at me with an unsettling mix of sorrow and anger, eyes glinting with something wild.

“Why are you doing this, Emma?” His voice was soft, almost tender.

My heart raced, but I stood up, clutching the book to my chest. “This has to end, Jeremy. You have to let me go.”

He stepped forward, his gaze intense, unwavering. “We’re meant to be together, Emma. I know every part of you, remember? There’s no escaping this.”

“No, Jeremy,” I said, forcing strength into my voice. “This isn’t love. This is wrong. Twisted. I never wanted this.”

His expression hardened, a flash of hurt giving way to fury. “You made me like this,” he said, his voice breaking. “You bound me to you, and now you’re trying to cut me away like... like I’m nothing.” He took another step, then lunged, grabbing my wrist.

“Stop!” I cried, yanking my arm back, but his grip only tightened.

He pulled me closer, his face inches from mine, eyes wide and unhinged. “I won’t let you take this from me, you ungrateful bitch,” he snarled, his voice raw with desperation. “You’re mine, Emma. We’re bound together. You think you can just toss me aside?”

His fingers bruised into my skin, and I fought back, wrenching my arm free, shoving him hard. He stumbled back, but his eyes were on fire with rage, his breathing ragged. In the chaos, I raised my voice, speaking the final words of the incantation with every ounce of strength I had left, pushing at the bond, ripping it apart.

A fierce wind tore through the clearing, scattering the candles as Jeremy clutched his head, a scream ripping from his throat. I felt the connection unraveling, the poisoned thread between us snapping one painful fiber at a time.

“Emma…” His voice broke, his face twisted in pain, lost. And then, like a light extinguished, his eyes dulled. His grip slackened, and he slumped forward, his expression hollow, empty.

I staggered back, watching him, the weight of what I’d done sinking in with chilling finality. Jeremy was… gone, his mind shattered, a hollow shell left in his place.

“Jeremy,” I whispered, but there was no recognition in his eyes, no spark. Just silence.

I backed away, nausea twisting in my gut as I stumbled from the clearing, fleeing into the darkness. The bond was broken, but it had left a scar, an indelible mark of the cost I could never undo.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The days blurred together after that night in the forest. Word spread quickly: Jeremy had been found wandering aimlessly near campus, vacant-eyed and unresponsive, as though he were caught somewhere between dreams and reality. The authorities, confused but sympathetic, labeled him “catatonic” and transferred him to a psychiatric facility out of town.

I never visited. I couldn’t bring myself to see him again—not like that. Friends of his, those who only knew him as the smart, driven student he’d once been, tried to reach out, but he barely responded. Occasionally, he would murmur something low and indistinct, a name he’d repeat under his breath.

My name.

The nurses told me this one day, almost as if they thought I’d be comforted. But it only deepened the hollow ache within me. He was there because of me, because I’d dragged him into something I couldn’t control, something I never should have touched.

One night, I took everything—the spellbook, herbs, candles, and vials—to the edge of town. Beneath a twisted tree, I dug a shallow pit, threw in the items, and struck a match. The fire crackled and grew, devouring each piece, and I felt a strange calm, as though I could burn away the past.

But as the flames died, a chill crept over me. In a shard of glass, I glimpsed my reflection—his shadow faintly behind me, watching. I blinked, and it was gone. Yet, the weight lingered, an indelible mark, as if he would always be there, woven into my reflection, beyond my reach.

So for some background my brother has autism but it hasn’t stopped him from being able to drive or get a well paying job. 
There is a big height and weight difference between us. (Him) a lot more than me. 
He has always lashed out at me violently. Verbally or physically. 
He hasn’t been physically abusive for a long time. Almost 10 years. But his verbal abuse is absolute venom. He is horrible. He uses every swear word and stands up which is confronting. I can’t even describe how terrifying it is.  If my parents tell him off for swearing at me or whatever He will say under his breath when walking away how he is going to kill me or my family, sometimes in detail. How he is going to slit my throat. Stab me. Sometimes he says how he wants to just grab my neck and break it. Or just squeeze it. He will say it to my parents even. But they don’t care because I was the one that upset him for whatever reason and he has “autism” so it’s valid. I swear to god he will kill me and my family one day. I went into his room and he must have 20+ knives. 
He is absolutely horrible to my mom too and treats her terribly as well. He always has to get his way or has a full blown meltdown.
My parents do everything for him in the house, his laundry, change his sheets, clean his room, make him dinner, make him coffee and snacks for when he comes home. It’s honestly ridiculous. He has never and I mean never offered to make my parents a coffee or a snack. Or do anything for them. 
Not long ago he scared me so bad it triggered something in me. My parents tried to have a discussion about it but my brother just blamed everyone else and didn’t apologise. 
I got so depressed I could barely function. I almost commit suicide. 
But my parents didn’t even notice. I honestly am at the point that I would rather live in my car at a park than be here. They’ve threatened to kick me out because I made an appointment to get a tattoo. I had to cancel it because they were that serious.
But my brother can do all this. 
I want to tell my parents what his behaviour does to me but I feel like nothing will happen. 
Am I overreacting and just an asshole sister who doesn’t understand? 

Edit: 
I appreciate the replies but just wanted to add in here that in my culture it isn’t strange to be living with your family at this age. But also wanted to add on here that I don’t have enough money to just pack up and leave and find somewhere to stay. I have dogs. I will be living in my car. I cannot afford accomodation.

I went to McDonald’s to get a hot coffee in the morning so I can read my book away from the cold. And as I was sitting there reading a man ask me for help so i said “ how can i help you? He said he only has a quarter and he’s hungry so i said i get you something like a burger combo and this other lady heard me she must’ve been homeless too and asked for help. But as i was ordering this meal the cashier was extremely rude and annoyed now ( she wasn’t before ) the homeless man was right next to me i should add. 

Made me thinks maybe her POV that she had to work for everything in her life so she’s mad when shes sees a “handout” or shes just having a bad day. Idk im not her. My guess is that they have to deal with homeless people hanging out and, not always but often, not being respectful of the customers, employees or facilities there. By buying them a meal I essentially reinforce that behavior so they will continue to come just chill at that location and make the employees day harder/less enjoyable.

My POV was it’s cold outside and someone needed a warm meal and i could provide just because i could. And the homeless man was actually very polite so i saw no problem in that moment. Just wanted someone to eat that can’t. 

I cant wrap my head of this situation I didn’t mean to make her day worse.

AITA?

1gguice,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFP/comments/1gguice/career_crossroads_get_experience_at_a_small_ria/,Career Crossroads: Get Experience at a Small RIA or Stay Put for CFP Certification?,"Hey everyone,

I am a 32M w/ 10 years in the industry, mainly focused on supporting RIAs with back-office operations and strategy (product development), I’m ready for a move into wealth management. I currently hold my Series 7 license and am considering joining a small, local RIA as a junior advisor/analyst, focusing initially on planning and administrative work with the goal of eventually growing my own book and advising clients.

To get a better sense of the local RIA landscape, I’ve started reaching out firms in the area and setting up coffee chats to begin networking and explore potential opportunities.

**TLDR**: Is it worth jumping to a small RIA now to get experience while working towards the CFP, or should I dedicate myself to getting CFP first w/ my current firm and then make the transition?

Here’s where I’m undecided:

**Option 1**: **Start now at a small RIA.** I’ve found opportunities at a few small, local RIAs where I’d work as a junior advisor. These roles would allow me to start with planning and administrative support, which sounds like the best way to learn the ropes before moving into advising and business development. This shift would mean taking nearly a 50% pay cut, and I’d still need to pursue my CFP while working. Fortunately we have a healthy nest egg and my wife’s income is enough to keep us afloat. The upside is gaining client-facing experience right away, but I’d have to weigh the pay cut and time investment.

**Option 2**: **Stay at my current firm, focus on the CFP, and transition after I’m certified.** My current employer would likely support my CFP journey, letting me dedicate time to study without the added responsibilities of a new role. After passing, I’d look to move directly into a client-facing position, potentially with more options since I’d be fully certified. However, with my company’s recent 50% return-to-office requirement, I’m hesitant due to my long commute, which is about 1.5 hours each way (could study on the train perhaps).

Additional context: Financially, my wife and I are stable, with a solid retirement base, so my primary goals now are to gain client-facing experience, maximize future earning potential, and build flexibility for our growing family.

Any insights on how either approach might impact my career trajectory would be greatly appreciated!",4,1730424771.0,CFP,1,1.0,False

Hi, the names Ghos and this is my first Reddit post so I hope I did right haha! I run a Discord for CPJ stuff called [The Mine Shack](https://discord.gg/ZEh6Es6u3m) and one of the users there (shoutout Red) is a completionist so he asked if I could make a Card-Jitsu checklist so he can complete his collection. I made a CPJ collection checklist which you can find the Google Spreadsheet [linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AezLqsphdpHWoBLDKyTA4-DpSdm3FJ19SpGYAYIaBI0/edit?usp=sharing).

I figured since everyone does not have Discord, why not post it here to help as many people out as possible who are trying to complete the collection too. It also displays the % of the collection you have completed, how many cards you have left and a pie chart to show you how you are doing with completion of the collection. I hope it helps y'all out on your collection grind!

(BTBD) CEO Buys Big – What’s Brewing in the Restaurant Chain?,"BT Brands Inc. ($BTBD) operates in the restaurant industry, managing a diverse portfolio of fast-casual and quick-service restaurants. Some of their notable brands include **Burger Time**, **Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern**, **Keegan’s Seafood Grille**, **Pie In The Sky Coffee and Bakery**, **Village Bier Garten**, and **Schnitzel Haus**. Recently, BTBD’s CEO, Gary Copperud, has been making significant insider buys, which could signal confidence in the company’s future.  
  
Here’s a breakdown of his recent insider purchases:

* **August 20, 2024**: 7 shares @ $1.29 (Total: $9)
* **September 23, 2024**: 40 shares @ $1.50 (Total: $60)
* **October 7, 2024**: 1,166 shares @ $1.55 (Total: $1,807)
* **October 9, 2024**: 104 shares @ $1.55 (Total: $161)
* **October 17, 2024**: 5,000 shares @ $1.70 (Total: $8,500)
* **October 28, 2024**: 10,000 shares @ $1.70 (Total: $17,000)

These purchases show a clear trend of increasing investment from the CEO over the past few months, particularly in October with larger transactions.

# Potential Catalysts:

* **Restaurant Expansion**: BTBD has been expanding its portfolio with acquisitions like **Schnitzel Haus**, an upscale German restaurant in Florida. This acquisition adds to their growing list of brands and could drive future growth.
* **Improving Performance**: Recent reports show that brands like **Pie In The Sky** saw a revenue increase of over 17% in Q2 2024 compared to last year[](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240812146703/en/BT-Brands-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results). Similarly, **Burger Time** locations reported a revenue increase of around 15%. These trends could be why the CEO is bullish on the company.
* **Cost Challenges**: Despite revenue growth, BTBD has faced rising labor costs and supply chain pressures[](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240812146703/en/BT-Brands-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results). However, the company's focus on cost reduction and operational improvements could lead to better performance in the second half of 2024.

With insider buying like this and potential growth from acquisitions and improved operations, it’s worth keeping an eye on BTBD for potential short-term movements or long-term growth.",1,1730423795.0,TeleSider,0,1.0,False

And I called in to our dispatcher to let her know what was happening and where we were even though they could have gotten my location from the  computer.

Strange, considering I barely remember writing them, let alone journaling at all... I hardly remember anything from my early years, busy from driving coast-to-coast non-stop to build a decent bank account. Look how that turned out...
It's my handwriting, no doubt—there it is, clear as day, looping and fierce across every line. The entries start like any trucker’s log, full of routes and road conditions, little observations as we're teached to do at truck driving school.
But as I read, the tone shifts, and my handwriting gets shaky and approximate. Then I remember. 

The night of Halloween 1994.

**October 24, 1994**
There’s something strange about Nevada this time of year. It’s the way the desert wind has a bite to it, how it carries the smell of sagebrush and dust, how the sky turns from deep orange to bruised purple and makes the whole landscape look haunted. I'm due to drive across the state in the next few weeks. 

Got to Tonopah early, barely had time to grab a coffee. We’re all meeting up at this truck stop off the 6, and it’s a grimy place, but it has this campfire pit where we gather when the sun sets. Jerry said it was great at this this of the year, ""like a rite of passage,"" he said. They’re all in their forties, fifties, old-timers with the road written into their faces. I’m the youngest by a few decades. Probably why most of the ones I don't know look at me like I shouldn't be there, everytime I go to one of these gatherings... Usually the others ignore me, which is fine by me. 

**October 27, 1994**
One guy I didn’t recognize. Never seen him around before. Not new in and of itself, however that one guy... Just standing there at the edge of the firelight, silent as stone. Didn’t say much, barely even looked up. None of the other guys seemed to be put off, but all ignored him unless spoken to. As always, I was more of a distraction... I probably shouldn't go to these anymore, Jerry hasn't even shown up. Just awkward. 

**October 30, 1994**
They’ve gone from accidents to hauntings to outright superstitions. All of them drunk. Incredibly, that makes them like me more. 

We’re huddled around the fire, about twenty of us. Multiple conversations, swapping stories. One of the guys — Tom I believe — even asked me where I'm headed next. 

That's when I heard it. Low and quiet, almost like a whisper: “There's always the shortcut.” The stranger stands a bit apart from us, arms crossed, eyes like coal. ""What?,"" I said, turning around. ""You said you had to be in Denver by tomorrow. That's quite the ride. So I said: there's always the shortcut."" Puzzled, I looked around at Tom, the guys... not one met my eyes. I turned back towards the stranger, but he was gone. All that was — and is — left is his voice, deep and succinct. ""There's always the shortcut.""

No one has looked at me since then, like the stranger's words had made me invisible. Better get to bed.   

--

Couldn’t sleep. That man—he was waiting for me by my rig. I almost turned back, but he looked so desperate, his eyes wild and dark, and I felt something twist in my gut.

“Listen to me,” he said, voice low, barely more than a breath. “Whatever you do, don’t take the shortcut. If you see it—just... don't take it.” He swallowed, glanced over his shoulder, and I swear, he looked as if he was running from something. “Please. Just don’t.”

I tried to ask him what he meant, but he was already moving away, slipping into the shadows. I stood there, cold and confused, a bad taste in my mouth. Then I got back in the truck, shut the door, and locked it tight. I lay there, mind spinning, but sleep pulled me under... for a few hours at least. Better get back to it, the road is long to Denver...

**October 31, 1994**
I woke up late. Later than I’d planned, anyway. There was no time for coffee, no time to think. I just threw my gear together and hit the road, the world around me hazy, like a half-remembered dream.

--

The sky was still heavy with the last of the dawn haze as I pulled onto the empty road. It stretched out ahead of me, cutting through the flat Nevada desert like a scar. I couldn’t shake the stranger’s words from my mind, circling over and over: If you see it...

Something about that warning itched under my skin. The others. They just went silent, like kids who’d been told a ghost story they half-believed. This is a well-known route, pretty common, and not once had anyone mentioned a shortcut. So why that weird moment?

--

Miles stretched on. The landscape was desolate, just sagebrush and scrub rolling on either side of the road, with the occasional rocky outcrop breaking up the monotony. By then, I'd made up for my late start. By noon, I’d hit that perfect rhythm where the hum of the engine melted into the background, and time began to slip. This was what I loved about the road, the way it let you disconnect. Even the strangest warnings and wildest stories could fade out here, where it was just you, the truck, and the endless blacktop.

Then, sometime around late afternoon, something caught my eye. Up ahead, a thin track branched off from the main road, barely visible, like it was half-buried under sand and years of disuse. My heart skipped. I knew the roads out here like the back of my hand, and I’d never noticed this turnoff before.

The shortcut.

My hands tightened on the wheel, and I slowed down, the gravel crunching under the tires as I approched the odd branch in the road. I could feel a strange pull, like something deep in my chest was telling me to turn, to see where that road went. But then, the stranger’s words echoed again. 

And past I went.

The shortcut quickly vanished in the rear-view mirror, and sent my mind racing. Was that it?

Skipped the shortcut. If it even exists.

I don’t know how long I sat there, engine idling, in a trance. Didn't even remember stopping the truck. Hours have gone by... I'd better shift back into drive and merge onto the main road, can't believe I lost all this time...

--

The rest of the drive was quiet, almost too quiet. As the sun dipped low, painting the sky with fire and shadows, I felt that unease creep back in. The road seemed to stretch on forever, no other cars, no signs of life. Just me, my rig, and the empty desert.

I finally stopped for the night about an hour ago, at a rest area miles near the Colorado border. As I killed the engine, I noticed something strange in the back of my mind—a foggy sort of sensation, like I’d left something behind on that road in Nevada, something I couldn’t quite... remember?

**November 1, 1994**
The first thing I remember is waking up with a start, like I’d been shaken out of a nightmare. But when I tried to recall any details, they slipped away, just shadows in the dark. I checked my log, saw the miles I’d covered, and my own scrawled handwriting in the entry from the night before: 

*Skipped the shortcut. If it even exists.*

I don’t remember writing that.

**October 30, 2024**
Thirty years. And tomorrow, I’ll be back on that same stretch of road, going east from Tonopah to Denver. I wonder if they still hold those gatherings, with the campfire. The roads are different too—more highways, more mapped out. So probably not. 

And yet, I’m holding these old, brittle pages, reading my own handwriting like it belongs to a stranger. It’s strange, how certain memories stay sharp while others slip through your fingers. I still don’t remember everything from that night, that trip. I don’t remember much at all, but that thin strip of road branching off, over and over, like it's always there—like a déjà-vu.

These pages—they’re proof. Proof that something happened, something I can't, for the life of me, remember. Why did I stop? None of the later journals refer or even allude to that night, in 1994...

I must admit, the thought stroke me a few times since I got assigned that same route, on that night, thirty years later. Sharp as a knife: what if the shortcut is still there?

The world’s changed in thirty years. We’re connected now, everything documented, recorded, tracked. Tomorrow, I’ll have cameras, a dash cam, and GPS. If the shortcut shows up again—if it even exists—I’ll see it, and I’ll have proof.

I’m not sure what I expect to find. Maybe just an overgrown trail leading to nowhere, or a memory that I can finally lay to rest. But there’s a part of me that feels it—that deep, quiet pull, the same feeling I had all those years ago, sitting behind the wheel, staring down that thin, sandy track.

Just trying my luck 'cause it's daytime where I live and most of the people here on r4r are from the other side of the world.

I am very much into fitness and sports — I'm a runner (not a pro), and I do Spartan races competitively. I am eager to explore more sports when I finally have the bandwidth to. Besides being active, I also enjoy having a downtime, and I use it to hangout with friends and do outdoor activities with them. I am also interested in going to speakeasy bars; though I am more of a cocktail gal than beer/on-the-rocks drink. I would drink any kind of coffee, but Vietnamese coffee will always have my heart.

If some of my interests resonate(s) with you (or maybe not which is alright), reach out to me if you're down to chat!

Notes:
- I apologize for being a short-replier in the beginning. It takes me sometime to warm up (at least when it comes to online chatting).

For starters, she's often meant to drive me to the bus stop (about 10 km's from our home) in the mornings around 6.30am and we arrive at 6.40ish - often times I've had to go to my dad last minute and ask him to drive me to the stop instead.  
Context - My mother and father have been divorced since 2011 when I was four years old and my dad was kicked out as soon as I was old enough so that I wasn't a little nuisence for her to handle, she's always needed someone to take on some sort of ""burden"" such as the chooks and ducks which she bought but she doesn't feed and water, dad does that, with the help of me sometimes if I'm not busy. My father lives here because he wanted to get closer to me, he lives in a demountable type thing as we're on property, it's a small shack type thing.  
Other than that, my father and I are pretty close, we shit talk her all the time and he's offered me to move in with him once he leaves here next year and goes back to where we're from.

Other than that, my mother has said some really scary things...  
""If your dog attacks my dog one more time I'm going to fucking stab it and then stab you!""  
Context - Dave (stepdad)'s dog is a Collie Rough, hers is a miniature poodle, tiny little thing with a bit of shiatzu in her. The Collie Rough gets overly excited and ends up drawing blood and out of instinct from the other dogs, they pounce on the injured dog as well because of the blood.

""I should fucking slit my wrist and watch all three of you (Stepdad, dad and me) watch!""  
Context - when she's mad she threatens to kill herself and often brings me into it as I used to cut myself two years ago.

""I should have an affair, I deserve one.""  
Context - she believes she ""deserves"" an affair simply because my stepdad won't uh... stick his wonker in her tonker.

Asides from all the shit she's said, she always complains about how she's got a ""stomach ache"" or a ""headache"" or even ""My feet hurt"" like woop-de-fucking-do! No one cares woman! When I'm sick or in pain I still have to fucking study and get to school - it's funny, she's doing Law School - or starting it now and she's always whining about being exhausted even though all she does is sit on her fat fucking ass all day and complain and drink cups of tea while she knits away on the couch - whinging about the 13 dogs (five are puppies) that... shocker, SHE bought!  
She's failed university so many times because of how fucking lazy she is.  
Since I was nine I've had to bring cups of tea and coffee to her because she's two lazy to walk two feet.

I'll be in my bedroom when she calls out and asks me to get the remote which is on the TV stand... My mum is a lazy cow that can't do anything by herself, when I say, ""You've got legs"" she says, ""Oh come on, be nice to your mummy, my mummy's gone."" And all that bullshit to try and guilt trip me because her mother died of cancer.

I never knew my grandmother, but my father told me my mother, grandmother and oldest sister are all the same because they're all fucking mental.

Anyways... that's all for now.

1ggtvf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1ggtvf9/stopping_statin_lifestyle_changes/,Stopping Statin - Lifestyle Changes?,"I'm a 64 year old female looking for recommendation about lifestyle and eating changes to overcome risk factors in my Advance Lipid Profile shown below. I eat moderate carb and avoid sugar and ultra processed food. Rarely eat bread or food made with flour. My carbs come from startchy veggies. I use a butter/olive oil mix to cook eggs, otherwise use Avocado or Olive Oil.

My dad's has had diabetes for 35 years and has horrible dementia. He has stents, once someone has a stent, statins are automatically prescribed. I'd rather die of a heart attack or stroke than end up with dementia. I want to control risk factors with lifestyle changes, not taking a statin that may have side effects of increased insulin resistance, cognitive decline and muscle weakness. I've been intermittant fasting for 3 years and dropped my BMI from 31 to 25. A1c has always been below pre-diabetic. CBC that my PCP orders semi-annually looks good. I'm sure I was insulin resistant as a child before anyone knew what it was. I still have signs of Insulin Resistance with some lingering central obesity. Fasting Insulin was 10 in April 2024. For physical activity I do an hour of advanced Pilates twice a week which includes flexibility and strength training. I'm on my feet alot taking care of my parents, but do not do regular cardio specific exercise.

Meds  
20 mg Olmesartan - BP runs 100/60 - 120/80.  
20 mg Atorvastin with recent tests below, now off and will recheck in 6 months  
81 mg of baby aspirin  
1 psyllium fiber capsule daily  
100 mg CoQ10  
Probiotic, Vitamin D3, and my sleep aid concoction of Tart Cherry, Magnesium Breakthrough, L-Theanine and Glycine

Recently had CAC and Advanced Lipid Profile testing via Quest. I was still on the statin and had coffee 3 1/2 hours before blood draw. I did not know my doc was going to order the draw that day, or I would have skipped the coffee. I was 16 hours fasted by the time the blood was drawn. Probably too long. Cholesterol rises the longer you fast.

The bad - elevated small and medium LDL particles and low large HDL particles. I’ve read that statins lower large HDL particles and don’t do anything to lower small and medium LDL particles. Doc will repeat in 6 months off statins.  I may repeat at a walk in lab in 3 months.

HS C-reactive protein = 1.4, slightly above optimal. Falls in average risk range.  I have been under stress lately taking care of aging parents, which can drive up CRP.

The good - LDL pattern A is optimal. Apo B and Lipo A are optimal.

Recent CAC Score was zero.  Same as 10 years ago.
