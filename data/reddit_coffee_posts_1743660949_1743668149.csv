1jqcsiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jqcsiv/the_start_of_a_long_journey/,The start of a long journey,"Hi all. So, I'm just over a week and a half in. I've already found this sub to be really useful for motivational and support purposes, so thank you. I just wanted to make a post to mark the start of my journey.

Making the decision to stop drinking was tough for me, because honestly I've always really enjoyed the taste and the effects on my life are not that pronounced. I spend more way money than I would like, my various health conditions are probably not helped by it, and I spend far too much time thinking about it and looking forwardt to the next drink. But I am a functional person with a family and a good job, part of a church etc. To the outside world no one would know how much I drank.

Since starting, one of the hardest things was telling the few people I have told. They were quite surprised and almost questioning it, in the sense of 'you don't need to do that do you?', because the affects of alcohol on my life have never really affected anyone else but me. Cancelling a trip to go to a whisky festival later in the year with a friend was a really tough conversation.

I have kind of tried to stop before and did about a month, although I was never quite as resolved as I am this time, it was more a 'break' to prove I could. But moderation has consistently failed to stop me drinking more than I would like each week and after writing out the pros/cons there are enough reasons in the con column that I am resolved to do this. It's going to be tough, I've been drinking consistently for 30 years.

The other thing I am finding hard right now is not having anything to drink to replace the booze with in the weekend evenings. I plan to get more into things like kombucha and the odd smoothie but I am suffering from a bout of reflux at the moment (one of the many reasons I am quitting the booze), so sitting there with water makes it harder. I've already had to quit coffee which I was also into in a big way because of this problem. Hopefully it won't be long before I can have some nicer NA drinks.

Wishing everyone the best in their journeys, God bless everyone trying to do this. I'll probably post again when I get to some milestones.

Anywho i just broke up with my bf(38) of 3 years. Back story. We dated for 3 years. I’m (36) a Pisces and he is a Taurus. We moved in together after 2 years of dating. Prior to that he would talk about marriage and family. I have a child, he has no kids. When we moved in together we was both unsure but i broke my lease so it was no turning back. I gave him money of rent and brought groceries etc for house plus my individual bills and my daughter expenses. I cooked and etc. we both worked from home.  He was ver routine and would get up every morning and have coffee and a smoke. He would log in and when he was not doing much at work, he would play the game. Now before y’all get me,  I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH A MAN AND HIS GAMING SYSTEM. I have to put that out there because men will tussle lol. My issues was simply this; 
He never  offered: he would clearly have nothing to do and when I’m running around to make breakfast for my daughter get her off to school while logging on to start my work day he never bothered to offer.
Yes i would ask for him to walk her to the bus or but why do i have to always ask if you see the routine and see schedule. 
He seemed lazy: He has a car that need to be fixed. Instead of fixing it he decided to buy weed every month and a six pack of beer every two days. He drink and smoked everyday all day. Have to smoke when he wakes up before he eats before he goes to bed. I literally knew he routine. Important thing that he need to get done, does not get done. 
Lacked empathy: it seem like he hated women. He would talk about he step mom and how his dad seems to saved her when she was single mom. If we watched a movie when the man is confessing his love to a woman, he would get annoyed or if a man would express how he love and treat hi gf/ wife, he would have something negative to say. When i asked him if he thought i brought value to his life . He said yea but couldn’t tell how. 
Emotional unavailable: i lost my mom and aunt 5 years ago to cancer and i have express how my mom was the matriarch of my family and how i miss them  dearly.  He never acknowledge my mom’s death day or console me when im going through grief. When we would have a disagreement, he would say, i do more for you then your family” which bring me to the next one 
bare minimum: he would pick and choose what he wanted to do when it came to me and my daughter. When i would invite him places he would not want to go but when i didn’t offer he would say that i dnt offer. He never wanted to have in depth conversations. Conversations were always superficial surface level. He was closed off and non chalant 

Lastly he didnt have a relationship with my daughter: my daughter is 10 and he literally was not interested in anything outside of him and his game etc. i have expressed all this concerns and he would just look at me and i ask for feed back he would say “ you didn’t ask me a question. Im listening to you. On new years i asked him what was his goals for the new year or something he wanted to work on… he said i want to work on a lot of things. When i said is that it? He said “iono i guess married or some. At the moment i knew this man didn’t like me of have a plan for us. I went back and forth for months when frustrated one sided conversations. I would ask him how he feel about me and us and moving forward and he would say he’s unsure and dnt how to feel. I want a man to be sure about me When i started packing my stuff, he came in the room and said “ i dnt know how i feel about this”  
When i finally decided to get my keys to my apartment t he wanted talk and i told him it was too late and he was the problem, he got update and told me to leave since i have my keys. 
I moved out a 2weeks ago on a Friday and and i didn’t hear from him until the following Thursday. He said he missed me and wanted to see and how i felt about “us” decline seeing him when i said that feeling and thinking about us was non existent because i tried when we lived together and he gave me nothing. After stated that i was the problem he proceeded to give me advice. I stopped him and said i would never take advice from a 38 year old childish  man who lacks empathy and emotional connections. He texted me “ i let your ghetto ass and your kid live off me” and asked for money.  I haven’t heard from home since Smh.

## What Makes an Egyptian Cotton Bathrobe So Special? The Allure of Long Staple Cotton

The secret to the extraordinary softness and durability of an Egyptian cotton bathrobe lies in the long staple fibers of the cotton itself. Unlike shorter fibers, these long strands create a smoother, stronger, and more absorbent yarn. This translates to a bathrobe that not only feels incredibly soft against your skin but also stands the test of time, resisting pilling and maintaining its plushness wash after wash. A true luxury Egyptian cotton bathrobe represents a superior level of comfort and quality.

For those new to the world of high-end textiles, understanding this difference is crucial.Think of it like comparing a basic coffee to a meticulously crafted espresso; both will give you caffeine, but the experience is vastly different.Similarly, a bathrobe made from regular cotton simply cannot match the indulgent feel of a long staple cotton bathrobe.

## Identifying Quality: Distinguishing Between the Best and the Worst

Not all bathrobes labeled ""Egyptian cotton"" are created equal. Here are key factors to consider when evaluating your options:

*   **Fiber Length Verification:** Look for documentation or mentions of certified Egyptian cotton. Be wary of vague claims. Many bathrobes will claim to use Egyptian cotton, but the quality and source may be questionable. Look for genuine certification if possible.
*   **GSM (Grams per Square Meter):** GSM measures the fabric density. A higher GSM generally indicates a thicker, more absorbent, and more luxurious bathrobe. Look for a GSM of 400 or higher for a premium feel. A thick egyptian cotton bathrobe will offer a superior sense of indulgence.
*   **Construction and Weave:** Terry cloth is a common weave for bathrobes, but variations in the loop size and density affect the overall feel. A tightly woven terry cloth will be more absorbent and durable. Other weaves like velour or waffle are also available, offering different textures and benefits. Waffle weaves, such as, can offer a lightweight egyptian cotton bathrobe option suitable for warmer climates
*   **Stitching and Finishing:** Examine the seams and edges for neat, even stitching. Reinforced seams indicate a higher quality garment that is less likely to unravel. High-quality finishing contributes to the overall durability and appearance of the bathrobe.
*   **Absorbency Test:** If possible, check reviews or product details that mention the absorbency of the bathrobe. A quality egyptian cotton bathrobe is highly absorbent,quickly wicking away moisture after a shower or bath. An absorbent egyptian cotton bathrobe is essential for a agreeable and practical experience.
*   **Softness Check:** Read reviews and see if product descriptions specifically state 'soft touch.' While judging outright softness online is challenging, looking for phrases like ""softest egyptian cotton bathrobe"" and other customer feedback can assist with the selection process.

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share my recent Hinge experience because I honestly have no idea what just happened.

A couple of weeks ago, I matched with a girl (22F) who lives about 7–8 miles away from me. We hit it off pretty well, talked consistently for around two weeks, and eventually moved the conversation to iMessage. Things were going great—good banter, lots of messages, even exchanged pictures. It felt like we were really connecting.

Last Saturday, she told me she was heading to the beach with her dog and even sent me a picture of her outfit before she left. Everything seemed normal. That evening, I messaged her just to check in and see how her day was, but I didn’t hear back. I figured she might be busy or tired, so I didn’t think much of it.

The next day, she finally replied, saying she’d been in a car accident on the way home from the beach. She told me she was alright but had to go to the hospital the next day because she was experiencing back pain. Later, she updated me that the doctors found a slipped disc and she had to stay overnight. I was obviously concerned and even considered visiting her in the hospital, but she assured me she was being discharged the next day and suggested we meet for coffee instead.

We kept chatting as usual, even sending each other pictures, and everything still felt normal. The next day, she postponed our coffee date because she had to take her dog to the vet. Apparently, her dog had been injured in the accident too and needed surgery. That night, she called me to apologize for rescheduling and promised we’d meet the next evening instead.

Fast forward to yesterday—our scheduled coffee date. I made sure to leave work early to meet her. Since I didn’t have her address, we agreed to meet at a supermarket car park near her place. I got there on time and let her know I had arrived. She responded, saying she was still getting ready, so I waited.

After 30 minutes, I checked in again. No response. Another 15 minutes passed, so I asked if she wanted me to pick her up from her house instead. She replied, “You can pick me up from my house if you want xx.”

So I asked for her address.

No response.

I waited another 15 minutes. Still nothing. At this point, I tried calling her, but she didn’t pick up. I sent another message:

“Hey, I’ve been waiting here for 30 minutes. Are you sending me your address so I can pick you up, or do you not want to meet? Can you answer the call, please?”

She read the message… and never replied.

I ended up waiting for an hour in total before realizing I had been completely ghosted. After two weeks of talking, hospital visits, dog surgeries, and actual plans to meet, she just disappeared at the very last second.

I’m not even mad—just confused. What was the point of all that effort if she never intended to meet? Has anyone else experienced something like this?",1,1743667103.0,DatingStoriesUK,0,1.0,False

I moved into my apartment 5 years ago. It is in the attic of a 6-story building (there are 8 apartments on each floor, including the attic).

No issues until four days ago, when I felt a strong smell of what I would describe as dust mixed with ground coffee.

I walked through my apartment to find the source of the smell, but I couldn't find anything. I also smelled the same thing in the hallway outside my apartment (it was neither stronger nor weaker than in my apartment).

I coughed pretty hard, like there was an irritant of some sort.

The next day, the smell disappeared gradually, but there was still an irritation in my throat and lungs. I went out and when I returned in the evening, the smell and the irritation were completely gone.

No issues for a few days. Then, last night, the whole scenario repeated.

I have no clue what it could be. I'd appreciate any ideas/experiences from you. Maybe it's a thing with attic apartments?

A few facts that could help:

\- All my windows were closed both times. Also, my apartment door closes very tightly.

\- I have an exhaust fan in my bathroom, and it was turned on at the time (so theoretically, nothing should be coming through it into my apartment). No other ventilation in the apartment.

\- It was raining both times when I felt the smell, but it also rained in the meantime, when there was no smell at all, so I don't know if rain is a factor.

\- The place is very, very clean. No dust, no coffee grains lying around, no dirty coffee mugs. I'm mentioning this because it smelled like dust mixed with ground coffee.

\- There are no signs of mold anywhere.

\- I haven't brought in any new furniture or home decor recently.

***TL;DR:*** A strange, dust-like smell has appeared twice in my attic apartment, causing me to cough. There is no obvious cause (no mold, dust, etc).",1,1743666758.0,HomeImprovement,0,1.0,False

Yet never enough for both","Hi, I recently visited VN after 10+ years of living overseas and it was rather a heartbreaking experience (or maybe I’m just overtly sensitive ?).
I was born and raised in the deep south, small little village where community really meant everyone knew everyone and every day was pretty mundane. But it was peaceful, and I was always a happy child. 
Moved to the states during my teens, and of course had my fair share of struggles coming from a small Viet town, with no English, both parents with little to no money, no skills that were valued in the States.
Anyways, fast forward to now, in my mid 20s, and I was so excited to come back home. Yet I was treated with such distant from the folks back home. They look at me like the other, and oddly enough, just giving me the worst attitudes. When it comes to family, everyone was extremely critical of everything I say & do. When I invite them out to eat, everyone said the place served bad food, when I bring them coffee, oh the coffee sucks. 

I speak the language perfectly fine, I can communicate affectively. So all of this comes to me as a shock. It’s like folks here (in my small town) didnt like me, but truly I didn’t say or do anything that I thought was offensive. I know the Viet community both in the US and back home value “saving face” and wealth is a big factor. I make average $, I don’t wear designer clothes, mid looking…etc. just a simple man. I was told by my parents that when I go out, make sure to give extra to cab drivers or young folks working at the restaurants. But when I do, they give me exact change and say they didn’t need it from someone like me? But when I dont, they call me a cheapskate for being “Viet kieu.”
Side note, when I was in Saigon, where I didn’t have any family and was just touring around, minding my business, every Viet person was very friendly and kind. So def not generalizing here. 
I expected the childhood that I left, hoping to find some sense of belonging and yet home never felt so different. I don’t feel at home in the US either.

Posting to see if anyone had a similar experience or has some insights on why I’m being treated this way, I’m sure my experience isn’t unique and again, maybe I’m just overtly sensitive.

I let that sink in and told her, let’s talk about this over coffee. Either we part ways on good terms, or we find an alternative that works for both of us. The conversation was great, but we didn’t really reach a clear conclusion. I think we had an incredibly deep talk about emotions, but not so much about \*what we should do now.\*  

Afterwards, we kissed for the first time. Later that evening, she sent me a message full of hearts, thanking me the conversation, and my understanding.

I used to jump around tasks like a caffeinated squirrel, wondering why the day ended with me still buried under a pile of unfinished work. 😅 Spoiler alert: It wasn’t because I needed more hours — I just needed better ones.

Here's how I swapped that chaos for a weekly schedule that actually respects my brain's energy waves, saved myself *10 hours* a week, and *still* managed to carve out time for binging the latest Netflix hit. 🎉

**The Lightbulb Moment: Energy Peaks Over Time Blocking**

So, here's the twist. While time blocking always sounds like the panacea for productivity woes, focusing on *when* I operate best was the game-changer. I mean, do you really want to stare at a spreadsheet at 3 p.m. when the post-lunch siesta slaps you?

- **Morning Glory**: If you're anything like me, mornings are prime time. I’m talking the peak of Mount Everest of energy. I tackle creative stuff before 11 a.m. Think writing, brainstorming, plotting my inevitable takeover of the world. 🌟

- **Post-Lunch Slump**: Settle for tasks that need less brainpower—emails, scheduling, or listening to that new podcast on five ways to declutter your garage. Your brain gets the easy stuff while your body processes those epic tacos. 🌮

- **Afternoon Recharge**: Ever tried a caffeine nap? Coffee nap + 20-minute power sleep = Turbo Mode. 🚀 I wake up feeling like I’ve leveled up in a video game — ready to conquer the ""analytical work.""

**Plan Less, Achieve More**

Instead of my former strategy, better known as planning every single minute, I now lean on an outline that respects my energy rollercoaster. This isn’t Hogwarts; you can’t just Avada Kedavra the fatigue away, right? 🎩

- **K.I.S.S.**: Keep It Simple, Silly! No need for a Technicolor Excel sheet with 50 tabs. One-page, flexible enough to accommodate that surprise mid-week existential crisis.

- **The Prioritization Game**: Every week, I pick *the* three missions that would make 80-year-old me proud. No more than three — because baby steps become enormous leaps.

- **Micro-Break for the Win**: 5 minutes here and there to do... well, nothing. Staring at a wall counts. Your mind thanks you by kicking procrastination's butt.

So what about you? Have you tried riding the energy peak wave instead of drowning in busywork? There’s no one-size-fits-all, but finding the groove that lets you dance through your day sure beats crawling. 🌊💃

I got a chest infection two weeks ago and I was barely able to breathe without coughing up a lung so actually smoking triggered a huge coughing fit so I just couldn't.

I feel like it would be madness not to try and keep this quitting smoking going now I've recovered from that, but it wasn't something I'd prepared for and some things are really hitting me out of nowhere, like incredibly vivid dreams that are making me sad because the people in them feel so real and some of them are self-aware and tell me they don't want to ""die"" when I wake up.   
  
Then when I **do** wake up my brain immediately goes ""You're a moving thinking skeleton right now but in 100 years you'll just be a dead skeleton in the ground, same as the people in your dreams just on a slightly longer time-frame"", which is a wild and pretty demotivating way to start your day. Usually I just make coffee and check my emails 😅

Also daydreaming feels almost psychoactive, like I'm a step away from being able to hear actual noises but not quite... It's just all very intense and while I do get some social anxiety and sensory overload in a day to day sense, I'm generally a fairly chill person on a restful routine so this is all feeling a bit much.  
  
I couldn't find anything concrete in research about timing of depression or vivid dreaming or any of this like there are for direct physical symptoms of withdrawal.

He was very appreciative of it, said it belonged in his house and not just at the office. Cute cute. We talked a while I mentioned the drink that he promised me, he tells me only if my parents know about it, I was not willing to oblige so we’re putting it off till graduation. 

The next day I had him sign my year book to which he drew a smiley, telling me that he’s only done this for two people: the VIPs. I sort of knew that the other person would’ve been my friend (same one I talked about earlier), didn’t jump at the chance to ask but she showed me what he wrote and turns out there’s no smiley which makes me wonder who’s the other? 

Then yesterday he texts me (school chat) to meet him before I leave since he has something for me, telling me honestly his only reason for not calling in sick was that it was his last chance to say goodbye to me. Crazy. cute?

And that is today, came in early met up with him. Wrapped in red with gold ribbons, it’s a shadow box with dried roses inside. Store bought but very sweet. Also a handwritten note, calling me his “friend”, signed off with his first name. Then we went to the teacher’s lounge and then the teacher’s office for coffee and chatting, which a certain feel to it. We talked *a lot*. 

I won’t be seeing him till next month (for exams and graduation). So here’s a little reflection. I’ve thought about us being just friends for a really long time and I’m very fine with it. He used to loosely mention how we would be great friends after graduation and I agree. To be honest, this turning into anything was really just a fantasy. Was there tension when he poured honey into my coffee? Yes, did he hold prolonged contact silently sometimes? Yes. But that’s all there ever will be, tension. If any of his colleagues were to find out we’re together he’d probably loose his job, and none of us wants that. I’ll just let him live as he will. I won’t try anything new, or tease, I’ll just treat it as how I would with a friend. 

One thing that has me wondering is today. Like I’m pretty sure he’s much close to my friend, maybe while he was her teacher anyways. Maybe as she drifted away, I found my spot. Maybe that’s why I’m getting this gift and not her? Oh well, it’s in the past. I am looking forward to coffee shop chats and bookstore browsing with him. ",1,1743665637.0,TeacherCrushes,0,1.0,False
1jqc8uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jqc8uf/tbt/,TBT,"Today in town just ran into my old friend and we decided to grab a coffee as we catch up, and during our conversation he reminded me of a very old scenario that happened to us when we were kids, story ilianza like this: 
  
 We lived in Dandora, and there was field near Boma( boma ni place takataka zote za Nairobi ziutupwa) and it was full of chokora, those times there was one particular chokora named “chokora kidem” famous for applying shit on people 😂. As kids we were scared of him.. that was a by the way, so we went to that field and decided we will play chobo uwa, am very sure everyone knows that game. The thing we decided that will be our saving grace was a bird named “bongau” those big birds that are found near Nyayo stadium.
     So as we were playing , one of the guys kicked the ball and it went to the other side which was boma, no one was willing to go for the ball, so we decided that we will all go for it. The place was clear no street kids around so we raced to take our ball , to our surprise 5 chokoras came out of nowhere and they blocked our way. One of them took our ball and told us “ mkitaka ball yenu lazma mtoboke” we were kids we did not have 
 any money, so one of my friends said “sisi hatuna dooh” they looked at each other and one said “haiya tufwateni then tutawapatia ball yenu” the ball was new, hatungewacha iende ivyo so we followed.
   They took us deep into boma, i never knew there was sections in which each waste is placed, there is a plastic section where plastic are kept, chemical section, wild animals section where when a wild animal is killed when it is in the residential area . There is even a kibanda. So we reached to a grounded lorry and they told us to enter, then they started to state their demand : 
    “Kuna chupa ya soda ya 1 litre hapa , blueband na carrot na kuna madem pale.” We were confused to what is happening , he continued “ ukichagua chupa inamaanisha utakunia kwa hio chupa hadi ijae,”😟all our faces .” Ukichagua blueband iyo inamaanisha utapakwa kwa haga then tukufinye na iyo carrot” 😧 we were so scared we did not want to hear number 3 “ ya mwisho ni uende ulambe wale madem chokoch kwa vitu zako(privates)” that time we did not know what was that but🫨. I was shaking, they could just see how terrified we were. “Tunaenda kucheza hii ball yenu , tunakam after 5 min kila mtu aseme amechagua gani.”
   We were left staring at each other, one guy said “mimi nachukua chupa juu ata nahara,”😂😂😂the way we wanted to bust out laughing but we were so scared we kept it to ourselves. The rest of us just kept quiet but we all knew no one is taking the blueband option, so it was either the girls or the bottle.
   As we were sitting there waiting for the worst i heard” yow ( my name) mnafanya nini uku” i turned and looked it was one of my friend who collects waste from plots and take them to boma, “ Jonhtez, tusaidie,” i said , he came to where we were and he shouted to one of the chokora “ mnadai kufanyia nini watu wangu,” .. “ unawajua, iza joh jonhtez, “ one of the chokora said, “ Ebu twendeni” jonhtez said as he signaled us to stand up , we were so happy that we just ran to johntez and hid behind him. “ Na ball yetu,” one of my friends said, they threw us the ball and said “ tusipatane kona mbaya vijana” and that was the end of our misery, i dont want to even imagine what could have happened to us if it was not for johntez.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from Punjab,India , currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

To thanda daal chawal kha liya.. aur bartan almari m hi chod diye... Subha tk wahi the... Abhi desk pr rakhe hai.. morning jog kr baad le jaunga socha tha... But, bhul gya.

So, abhi subha ke 5:30 ho rahe hai... Mai niche gya... Lekin mummy pehle se hi utti hui thi.. thodi bhook lag rahi thi..  I asked for some fruits... Mummy ne kele aur angor pakda diye... Khane ke baad m turant nikal gya... I usually stop at two points during my morning walk;

1. Mata ka mandir at 4 pusta
2. Anpurna Mandir, near chauhan patti

Aur.. m mandir pauch kr sort of small prayer krta hu.. waise m week m do hi baar morning walk pr ja paata hu.. as 2 hi week off hote hai.. Although, the prayer starts from gaytri mantra, and I finish my prayer with my Mom, and her .... Uska naam apne aap hi aa jaata hai.

I mean while finishing, it goes like... Mummy ki health thik rakhna, M$&#--$ (Sorry Naam nahi le sakta yaha) ko thik krdena.. aur sab ko khush rakhna... Aur har baar mujhe ye realise baad m hota hai.. Dono mandiro m ... It's the 3rd week matlab 6 din already ho gye hai.

I blush everytime after I finish my prayer... All because of her... To m dono point cross kr chuka hu.. aur wapas aa raha tha... M hamesha 3½ park m jaat hu.. kyuki waha mujhe mayank milta hai.. one of my school friend. Kl bhi mila tha.. Aur.. maine 5,000 steps poore kr liye. During my walk in the park.. I was listening to ""can you hear the music"", I was in my zone.. walking with a constant speed, mai kisi cheeze pr dhyaan nahi de raha tha...!

Suddenly, bike ne mere right hand ko hit kiya.. kuch feel to nahi hua.. maine jaldi se earphone nikala aur, bola bhai lagi to nahi.. he was kinda shocked ki.. ye banda thuka aur keh raha hai bhai lagi to nahi.. I said, ""nahi bhai m thik hu"", earphone lgaya, and walking continue Kri.

There was a girl sitting on the bench, she also saw that... She kept staring at me every time I was crossing the bench. After some time... Mere 10,000 steps hogye the.. and 7 bhi baj gye the... Mayank ne bola chalte hai.. I said last round.. and phir hum dono nikal gye.. thodi baate.. bakchodi... Maine pucha bhai juice pike chalte hai.. we were at the vendor... Do glass juice pikar m aur mayank apne apne raaste chale gye.. Mayank btw CA ki articleship kr rha hai.. uska final year me.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from Punjab,India , currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

1jqc72k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TreasureHunting/comments/1jqc72k/justin_posey_finding_your_treasure/,Justin Posey; Finding your treasure,"I’m getting extremely strong Montana vibes, throughout the document he mentions that we already know where it is and the ending of the poem “what you seek you already know” makes me think Montana, But it gets deeper. Third Stanza:
“In ursa east his realm awaits;
His bride stands guard at ancient gates.
Her foot of three at twenty degree,
Return her face to find the place.”

ursa (latin for bear which could hint at bear tooth mountains) but is also the name of the constellations Big Dipper and Little Dipper, or Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The fact he did not capitalize the name Ursa make me think of Ursa Minor which, is a fixed constellation and its tail of the stars Polaris is visable almost 24/7 around Montana and Wyoming area.  You also have three lady of the Rockies which is a 90ft tall white statue of the virgin of Mary, who is refuted to as the bride of Christ, the statue is also right ontop of the continental divide which could be referenced as “ancient gates” as it separates water ahead from the bearing straight to the Pacific Ocean. I have never visited the lady of the Rockies but I believe the foot of three might refer  to a sort of triangular geological formation or triangular gesture. As well with the help of astrological apps Polaris seems to be at a 20 degree angle when facing the direction Virgin Mary is facing (southeast). If someone who has been there or can go, you have to stand infront of the statue and look at a 20 degree angle and see what the geological formation look like and what the view is. Where it gets confusing is the last part of stanza “return her face to find the place” it could mean searching the opposite direction of her (northwest). I don’t know much more but I think this is the generalized area. However Polaris which is a fixed point meaning it always point to tru north, if we do look outwards at a 20degree angle you will be able to see Polaris. However he uses the word “his realm awaits” since a fixed point it can never be observed directly so I’m confused as if the direction we’re supposed to look facing the statue or opposite. I do believe the statue is a good starting point.

This was sorta my overall conclusion but I’m also going to share other points and other potential deciphering abt the poem.

Stanza 1 

“Can you find what lives in time,
Flowing through each measured rhyme?
Wisdom waits in shadowed sight—
For those who read these words just right.”

The first to lines could either mean a river, or a constellation both with could be revealed if visiting the Virgin Mary statue , however with 
Stanza 2
“As hope surges, clear and bright,
Walk near waters’ silent flight.
Round the bend, past the Hole,
I wait for you to cast your pole.”
Strong river vibes can’t help but am-erg .



Ursa East also confused me because why east? Maybe meaning beartooth mountain like I mentioned before but I found nothing of the bride nearby.   
Stanza 4

Double arcs on granite bold,
Where secrets of the past still hold.
Beyond the reach of time’s swift race,
Wonder guards this sacred space.” 

I can only think this means some sort of curve or opened underbelly of a granite structure, the area in butte Montana is very known for its granite like unique structures all around. Justin mentions in the documentary his brother took his own life and he did so in butte Montana, right in the middle of all this. I believe they have fished there or spent time together there. Justin and his brother grew up in butte Montana and have most definitely made amazing memories and have their own “spots” they went too,I think this could be a big lead, that or maybe the treasures even hidden near/ at his brothers final resting ground. 
He talks about how he thinks he coulda saved his brother if he had only done things differently “beyond the reach of times swift place wonder guards this sacred place. Justin often refers to the hunt itself to be the real beauty behind treasure hunting and not the treasure itself hence why he re-buried. Wonder drives curiosity and shapes us to explore and enjoy the world we’re in “wonder guards this sacred place”
Stanza 5 

Truth rests not in clever minds, Not in tangled, twisted finds.
Like a river's steady flow-
What you seek, you already know.

I believe he’s saying that being the smartest in the room isn’t going to get you the win automatically, you must be contempt and calm and seeming walk the path to the treasure at it will reveal itself to you, “you seek what you already know” hinting at the simple fact we do know where it is. All fingers point to this area in Montana and I believe the clarity and unity this hunt will bring upon us will be a great honor for Jason



My information was all over the place and  I haven’t necessarily applied any clues from the documentary into this thinking I have noticed various time changes, direction of his coffee mug and the number and at certain times what appears to look like a pachleete on one of his monitors. If you have any questions or inquiries feel free to let me know I believe I  could be on a good road here. ",2,1743665405.0,TreasureHunting,0,1.0,False

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Super Automatic‍ Espresso Machine

When selecting a **super automatic espresso machine**, several factors should ⁣influence your ⁤decision:

*   ⁣**Grinder Type:** The grinder is a crucial component. Look for machines with ceramic or stainless steel burr grinders,which‌ produce a more consistent grind than⁤ blade ‌grinders. A consistent grind leads to better flavor extraction.

*   **Milk Frothing ⁣System:**​ Consider the type ⁣of milk frothing ​system that best⁣ suits your needs. Some machines‍ have automatic frothers that ‍create ⁤perfectly textured ⁤milk with the touch ⁣of a button, while others have manual steam wands that allow for⁢ more⁣ control.

*⁣   **Water Tank Capacity:** Choose a water tank capacity that aligns with your consumption habits. Larger tanks require less frequent refills, which is especially crucial for‍ offices or households⁣ with multiple coffee drinkers.

* ⁣  **Bean Hopper Capacity:** Similar to ‌the water tank, the bean hopper capacity ⁤determines ⁣how often you need ‌to refill the beans. A larger hopper is ⁢more ⁣convenient​ for high-volume usage.

*   **Programmability:** ⁣Look for machines ⁣with programmable settings ⁣that allow you to customize the coffee ⁢strength, water ⁤temperature, and ‌cup⁢ size.These settings enable you to ⁤fine-tune your espresso to your exact preferences.*​   ‌**Ease of Cleaning:**⁢ A **low​ maintenance** machine that is an **easy to ⁣use espresso machine**is essential. Consider models with automatic cleaning cycles ​and removable components for easy⁢ rinsing.‍ The **self cleaning espresso machine** helps minimize maintenance.

*   **Size and Footprint:** Ensure ⁢the⁣ machine fits‌ comfortably on your countertop without‍ taking up too much space.Measure your available​ space before making a ‍purchase.*   **Budget:** **Super ⁤automatic espresso machine cost**can vary⁣ widely. Determine your budget upfront and prioritize the features that are most critically important ​to you. Check for a **super automatic espresso⁢ machine sale** to save money.[[Explore Top Rated super automatic espresso machine on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=super automatic espresso machine)

Not that I would say journaling or creative writing is a cure-all solution. All I know is that zero of the people surveyed throughout my life are even trying it. I rarely come across someone who even reads regularly.

Unless they are doing it and they feel like nerds, so they don’t admit it. Typical.

Today I’ll give you nerds some pointers on how to get started with a writing habit and the benefits to look forward to.

Keep in mind that I’m just a boy. Just a writer. Not a professional. This is all my opinion and some stuff I’ve read on the internet. Kinda like everything else on the web. So do not trust me. I always post my sources at the bottom of my writing.

# Writing Changes The Unseen

We live in a world driven by performance and appearances.

How fit are you? How good are you at what you do? How much shit can you take?

While strides have been made toward mental health awareness, it still tends to fall to the wayside next to life’s other concerns. Naturally so, considering that it’s not a tangible thing to be observed.

A daily writing habit can improve your mental health, and it’s easy to maintain as long as you can commit 10–20 minutes a day.

# Writing Improves Calmness, Memory, and Self-Esteem

If you’ve got an embarrassing, painful, or cringy thought you wish you could evict from your brain — write it down. Stop trying to yell it out in the shower.

When you write, you are literally taking thoughts from your head and placing them onto a page. As it leaves your head, you are processing. Then finally it is all on the page and you have to face it.

Don’t worry if you don’t want to read it when it’s finished. You can burn it if you want to! Yes, burn it and watch it disappear as the flames dance in your eyeballs… Um, sometimes the only therapeutic effect necessary is getting it out onto the page.

Have you ever talked with someone about a problem, when you suddenly see the solution in the middle of the conversation? This happens to me a lot when I text about an issue.

There is a bit of magic in writing down your problem because it allows your brain to see it in a different dimension, and you can actively solve problems that way.

# Why Write When You Can Type?

I would never assume there’s no benefit to getting everything out on the screen if that’s all you have available. However, scientists did find that writing, specifically handwriting, promotes better memory and learning.

Intricate hand motions and greater sensory engagement (vs typing) better engage connectivity patterns in the brain that are related to encoding new information and storing memory.

It all sounds very “sciencey” to me, but trust me. You can trust me.

# How Do You Feel After Writing?

Writing puts me in a more present state of mind against the frantic anxiety of everyday thoughts. It narrows my problem down to the one I am writing on the page, or takes me to the fictional world I’ve conjured in my mind.

Not only is it a decluttering process, but it also forces me to spend time with myself and analyze my thoughts for more than a split second. Spending 10–20 minutes a day with yourself to check in — whether it is journaling or creatively weaving your ideas into a story — is a total vacation for your mind.

If we turn our attention toward the head meat, it causes the head meat to purr and enter a state of focus and calm. It’s the only way that we can be friends with the head meat.

Self-assurance, peace, and positivity are some of the mental rewards for getting to know yourself better.

# A Quick List of Journal Starters

While there are guided journals, such as *Burn After Writing* by Sharon Jones, there are people more interested in the unforgiving void of a directionless blank page. If this is you, maybe rethink it. Directions could be fun, right? It’s hard out here.

Anyways, here are some daily writing starter ideas for us adventurers:

# Affirmations

These can be something you make up, or something you’ve heard before. Affirmations can help set up your frame of mind before you start writing.

Anne Lamott, an author, says that before she writes anything, she tells herself, “I am not going to show this to anyone.” It allows her to write recklessly, which is the only way to do it.

# Gratitude

This will keep you grounded and happy. Pick one to three things you’re grateful for and write them down. You don’t have to go into detail if you don’t want to.

Just writing a single word or phrase about the things you are thankful for has a massive benefit for overall mood quality and positive outlook.

# Reflections

What did you do today? What is it that you have done, exactly? Where were you on the seventh of May, five years ago at this time? Does anything stand out today? Did you see a good movie? Read a good book? Are you feeling anxious or depressed? What about? What is your solution for your problem?

Need I go on? Reflections are endless. Take an aspect about your life or just your day, and then write about it somehow. Give that movie a review, say your real feelings toward something you hid them about, write your social security number on the back side of the page.

Reflections are however and whatever you want to write.

# Goals or Ideas

Keeping your goals in mind and having plans on achieving them allows them to be present and reachable. Like mental health, even small goals and creative ideas can get pushed aside because they’re also intangible.

One of my favorite ways to kickstart my journal entry or fiction writing session is to write down five ways that I wish the world was different. Then I pick tiny, everyday inconveniences that I wish would go away and write down my ideas on how I’d fix them. It’s killer therapy with a creative kickstart.

# The Pen, Mightier When Green

There are countless studies on the psychology of color. Thanks to advertising, we know a lot about how the mind can be manipulated using different colors.

Blue delivers a message of trust. Trust me. It also urges a sense of focus. Red can literally increase your heart rate and raise stress levels. Green improves focus, promotes creativity, and reduces anxiety.

Black…well, I don’t know what that color does to the human psyche, but I know that it reeks of regular old boring ink.

It might be a wobbly foundation for a theory, but I do all my writing in green pen in hopes that it will further build upon the benefits of writing itself. Does it help me focus more or inspire me to be more creative? I think so.

Don’t trust me, though. Try green or a different color to see if you notice any improvement in your writing or state of mind. Green may not always be the choice. Psychology is subject to variables. If your grandma used to beat you with a giant green spoon, then the color green may cause adverse effects.

Growing up, our cooking spoons were made of brown wood. So I’m in the clear.

# What To Do with an Old Journal

*Burn it, I say!*

At least, that’s what I do with mine. I’m more of an “out with the old, in with the new” type of guy. I write it down, fill the journal, and start a fire. Some experts say it’s therapeutic to reread old entries, but others disagree. Some believe that it’s a detriment, akin to how going to therapy a little too much can put you in a negative state of mind.

I feel the benefits from simply writing, so I save my reading for books. I do keep two journals though. One for my journaling and one for my creative fiction writing. I always keep my fiction notebooks, in spite of the ugly, senseless first drafts and ramblings.

# The Best Advice for Keeping Your Writing Habit

You can’t dread it, you have to welcome it. In order to look forward to writing, you have to allow yourself some concessions.

>""I am not going to show this to anyone.""

Keep in mind that this is good for you and it’s just for you. Unless you’re someone that likes to share their most inner thoughts. In that case, Godspeed. In any case, allow yourself to be sloppy and ramble and scribble things out and overdo it, or fall short.

Some days you may have a few thoughts and on others you will have a few pages. No matter what, just give yourself at least 10–20 minutes of writing time a day.

Reflective journaling may have a more proven track record of mental benefits, but I believe there is still value in creative writing during your journaling sessions. Sometimes it’s best to escape for a while and spend time in a world you build for yourself.

I know the machine isn’t great but i have noticed the variable flows partly the grinder in few weeks changes settings and after a clean grinds a little finer and i am saying little increment.

Hi,

I need to upgrade my machine. I hate it. Sunbeam barista plus...

However. I'd love to be able to fix it. Mostly out of curiosity (I have a background in physics and want to know what is wrong and fix it) but also (mainly) so I can have decent coffee in the meantime until I have the funds for an upgrade.

I loathe that I am unable to find a service manual to dive in and disassemble so am looking for some pointers on what might be the root of the issue so I can open her up and investigate the likely causes myself...

Anyway... The issue I am having is that my group head/portafilter is leaking. I replaced the seal yesterday and it's tight. I have to squeeze it close. However the pressure builds and at the same volume of espresso grind, on the same grind setting as I've used in the past with no issue, I now get leaking around the portafilter that comes out of the group head and drips into my mug.

Clearly something isn't sealing. But it's not coffee that is dripping down but clear water...

Any ideas where to start with troubleshooting? Is the pressure building and forcing water out of a pipe before it squeezes through my coffee grinds?

Any ideas where to start to fix?

Also. I would love advice on a machine that I can replace this with that has the ability to easily service and upgrade parts in the future? (Challenge being that I live in NZ and have limited options.. I want to be empowered to maintain and fix my machine in the future...

So I am a lead teacher in a twos classroom at my center. Our ratio is 1 to 5 but yesterday we had only 8 children, including a significantly younger child who was moved to our room due to a lot of staff being out sick. We have two kids potty training in underwear that need to be taken to the bathroom every half hour. We also have a new student and this was only her second day and she is still adjusting. First part of the day went pretty well - morning snack, movement and music, morning circle, art, STEM, reading time, outside time, etc. I have an amazing coteacher (let’s called her Cheryl for the sake of the story) and the first floater teacher who covered our breaks (let’s called him Jimmy). The day was a bit stressful with the younger tot, new kid, and two kiddos potty training - but hey, I’ve had a lot harder days. I go on my break around 11:45am, leaving Cheryl and Jimmy to oversee lunch and the  set up for nap. 

Then enters the second floater teacher, let’s call her Inez. Inez has a bit of a reputation for needing constant direction to do things in any classroom she’s in. Otherwise she just will just sit with the kids and let them do whatever. She only works part time, as does Jimmy and other floaters. Inez has no-called, no showed several times over the last few weeks and she caused an issue in my room a few months back when she repeatedly put a child in the wrong diaper, the brand of which this little girl was allergic to and the front office and I had to have a meeting with her parents to apologize for it happening. She hasn’t been put in my room since that incident. 

Yesterday, Inez was sent to cover for Cheryl to take a training on some new policy. This was at the worst possible time because they were in the process of getting kids cleaned up from lunch, placing nap mats, etc, and the significantly younger kid was super cranky by this point because her classroom runs on a slightly different schedule including lunch and a nap. Our potty trainers both needed to try potty and get a pull up put on for nap. New girl was getting frustrated with everything because she wanted food other kids had and isn’t used to not being able to just ask for different food (first time in daycare, used to getting whatever whenever at home) and wanted a stuffed animal that was at home. Some of my regular kids were acting crazy because they’re two years olds. 

I return from my break, Jimmy leaves, and Inez is just standing over the last kid eating lunch and paying no attention to the kids dumping toys, eating food off the floor, or fighting over books. Jimmy had been helping all my potty trainers and doing diapers, and had put down all the nap mats. I finish potties and diapers, wipe everyone’s face (because everyone still had dirty faces from lunch), get everyone to clean up and on their mats, finally turn the lights off and turn on the piano loop with rain sounds we play at nap. I asked Inez to put our visiting younger friend down to sleep first while I dealt with some of our kiddos who take longer, and for whatever reason - new girl and three other kids kick off and start screaming for different things. I get up to try and soothe them, while the two kids I was sitting with immediately start dumping towards and fighting over things. Inez does and says nothing about any of this, except to inform me about one little girl climbing on a table (which was right next to her and I was on the other side of the room at this point I might add). I’m running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to calm like six kids by this point. Inez is still just sitting there with the one kid who is asleep by this point (how the kid fell asleep with all that racket the world will never know). I ask her to go to another kid next, raises her voice unnecessarily loud and wakes up the younger kid again, who begins to cry at being woken up. So she starts putting her back to sleep. 

So I call the front office (which we have been told to do when things become overwhelming at nap especially with kids from other classrooms), I was when Cheryl is coming back because we need her to help get all our kiddos to bed. It’s 1:15pm now and nap officially started like thirty minutes ago and ends at 3pm sharp, and no one is asleep. Some of my parents really want their kids to sleep for at least an hour and a half, and many kids take fifteen to twenty minutes to get to sleep. So time is ticking or I’m going to get a lot of complaints. The front promises Cheryl will be back ASAP, so I return to the two kids I was with before. Inez no sooner abandons the kid she already woke up once and is still crying and kicking the wall, and just start sweeping with the broom in an aggressive manner, bumping into things and making even more noise which disturbs the kids who are somehow beginning to drift off. I calmly tell her that we can clean up once the kids are put to bed, and she just glares at me. I repeat myself and she says in a very nasty tone “well it doesn’t sound like you need my help since you want Cheryl to come back so bad!”. 

I’m someone who never wants to belittle or make another teacher feel bad because this is a really fucking hard industry with little true thanks. I apologize to her, tell her I value her hard work (not that I’ve actually seen her do any at this point) and that I didn’t mean for what I said on the phone to the office to make it sound like she wasn’t being of any help (even though that kind of was the case). I was getting overwhelmed and frazzled admittedly when I made the call. Inez shrugs and looks at me and says “you’re so talented, you can do it” in a very sneering tone while still aggressively sweeping. Two kids were still crying and had been for a while now, and no one was asleep. It’s 1:20pm now. I feel like I’m going to lose my temper with her so I just stop engaging at this point, which may have been a mistake on my part but I didn’t want to raise my voice or say something stupid that could come back to haunt me. I go back to trying to put my two kids to sleep, and Inez comes over and begins aggressively sweeping near the two kids, which distracts them greatly and the bristles even grazed my leg a few times because she was sweeping so close. She eventually stops sweeping and goes back to sit with the little visiting child, who’s tantrumed herself back into sleep at this point and is the only kid asleep in the room. Kept rubbing her back anyway, wouldn’t go tend to any of the other five kids still wide awake. 

Cheryl comes back from the training shortly thereafter, Inez grabs her stuff (which knocks over mine in the process and she doesn’t pick it up or even say sorry), then leaves quickly, letting the door slam. I honestly was about to cry at this point because I’m so fucking frustrated at a grown woman with three kids of her own acting like a moody teenager. Cheryl, bless her heart, saw my face and came over to ask what was wrong. I burst into tears telling her the above. She gave me a hug and told me I needed to let the office know now and to ensure I spoke with them about this before I left for the day because that was unacceptable behavior. I called and I met with my direct supervisor who basically told me this was a personal dispute between the two of us and they’d like me to address it privately with her because they need us to be able to work together because we’re short staffed at the moment (two teachers on maternity leave, and another broke her leg and is on a medical leave of absence right now). My kids weren’t all asleep until 1:40 to 1:50pm, and other than some glares, none of my parents raised a stink. My supervisor advised me to look at her favorite things sheet (something all employees have and is listed on the hallway wall so people can know better how to show appreciation to the teachers at our center), maybe buy her a coffee and talk it out like adults, but not to do it in front of the kids.

So, in a nutshell, I’m being asked to apologize and clear the air with an incompetent part time teacher who only works four hours of the day, and ensure she doesn’t feel bad when she was the one who behaved unprofessionally and didn’t give the kids what they needed. And if I don’t then it’s pretty much my fault if she continues to act this way.

1jqbj3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jqbj3b/hm_jeeves_and_the_purple_tie/,[HM] Jeeves and the Purple Tie,"I was settled in the bath, soaping myself to the tune of some song I can't quite remember when the door bell rang and my man announced the arrival of Lord Proudfoot. I told him, in a loud carrying voice, that I would be out in a jiffy, while settling myself down to a long lingering bath. The music I toned down. Bitter experience had taught me that admirers of my music were a select group and that detractors were often vocal (in a non-musical way). Bertram was open to visitors, convival if that's the word. But not in the morning. Not while in the bath. Not to Lord Proudfoot.

The last night had been long. Parts of it were, so to speak hazy. The sky was no longer dark when I returned, or was returned to the flat. Jeeves had looked fatherly, but a trifle disapproving as he undressed me, noting the red stains on the old collar (or what had been a collar in better days) and the unsteady walk of the young master. So, what was noon to Lord Proudfoot was more in the lines of a bleary-eyed morning to me. And I certainly needed the bath after last night.

There's nothing like a couple of eggs, done just right, with a cup of coffee and a brace of toast to set you right after a late night. I could feel parts of the night filtering back to me as I tamed the runny yolk and downed the coffee. The exact details escaped me, but I could recall some gin of the best sort, some of that heady music the new places on the West End love, and a black cocktail dress. Later parts of the night (or early morning, if strict accuracy is required) were more hazy, but I could recall the dress lying on the floor and heavy breathing.

As I wiped the last morsels from my mouth and sighed, I could hear a loud stamping without and Jeeves respectful firm voice,""I fear, your Lordship, that Mr Wooster is unavoidably detained. A matter of the utmost urgency..."" There was an oath (the sort that is removed from books of the fruitier sort) and the door opened unceremoniously. The last and the noblest of the Proudfoot clan burst in.

""Proudfoot, old man,"" I said with a feeble attempt at a nonchalant air. His face seemed red and he seemed unable to speak. I heard loud breathing and all evidence seemed to point to it coming from the Proudfoot chest. ""Long time no see"", I added to break what seemed to me to be an awkward silence. Jeeves hovered around the door, coughing like a sheep and looking gently remorseful.

""You ---"", he uttered another of those unspeakable words, but this time it was one more suited to the dockyards. Ignoring the rampaging elephant in the room is all very well, and the stiff upper lip is what makes the Woosters the Woosters, but I felt that the time had come, perhaps to ask him gently what the devil he meant.

Jeeves cleared his throat. ""If I may intervene sir"", he said, as if he was discussing an obscure poet of the eighteenth century, ""His lordship appears to be under the impression that you spent last night in his bedroom."" I was flabbergasted. Bertram is known to spend his nights in his own bed, in nightclubs, occasionally even in what are called houses of ill repute, but the Proudfoot establishment is one I give a wide berth.

Old Proudfoot didn't seem to believe in explanations. He expressed a desire to wring my neck, but before he could delve into the details, his mind seemed to wander, and he opined that he wanted me boiled alive. I tried to impress on him the trifling practical difficulties associated with these actions, and he seemed impressed with my way of thinking, for he expressed his opinion that shooting would do the trick.

""Hate to contradict you, old top"", I said with an attempt at nonchalance, ""but I was in Soho all night."". ""And why would I be in your bedroom anyway?"". He expressed his desire to consign Soho to the netherworld before asking me not to test his patience. ""My wife, don't attempt to deny it, was once engaged to you"", he said, pompously. I could have told him that this was true of half of London's fairer sex, but I felt the hour for glib repartee had passed.

""I was at at my country seat last night"", said Proudfoot. ""And when I arrived this morning, I saw my wife in bed..."" ,here words failed him and his face went crimson. ""Horrifying"", I said. ""The lax twentieth century. Modern women. A century ago, and she would have got up at dawn, and had your brekker ready, and sat at the hearth eagerly awaiting your return."" Jeeves said something poetic about a housewife plying her care.

""None of your cheek!"" he shouted, though I failed to see what that part of the anatomy had to do with it. ""I say her lying in bed"", I said. ""And she was..."", he paused uncertainly here, ""only partly dressed, and on the bed was this tie"". Here, he dramatically flourished a Drones club tie, with a jaunty B.W on it. ""Forgot to dress completely, did we"", he said with a sneer.

I stared at the tie in dismay. Had I ......no, it was impossible. I hadn't worn my Drones club tie last night. In fact, I never wore it on my sojourns to what Victorian writers call the seamier side of London. Anonymity was Bertram's motto on these occasions. A few earlier escapades having made their way to my Aunt Agatha's disapproving ear, my modus operandi these days relied heavily on the incognito.

While I tried to explain this, Proudfoot was most perplexing. He appeared unable to follow my train of thought, instead saying something irrelevant about a horsewhip. My palms started sweating and I could feel the old heart begin to thump, when there was a gentle cough.

""If I may interrupt, your Lordship"", he said bowing ever so slightly. ""I believe I can shed some light on this unfortunate situation."" Proudfoot said something about light being damned, but Jeeves' respectful tone seemed to strike some chord in him, and he listened. Jeeves turned to me. ""Sir, I hope you remember the minor disagreement we had regarding the purple ties that the Drones club committee had, unadvisedly, in my opinion, approved last month?"", he asked. I nodded. The memory rankled. I had scored what I considered a rare and historic victory in that skirmish, with Jeeves giving in, almost without a fight, with a humble ""Very good, sir"".

""I regret to say, sir"", said Jeeves with an apologetic cough, ""that a few days later, I was remiss in forgetting your instructions about the purple tie. "" I stared at him. My mind had been occupied with various other matters like a racehorses and cards, but come to think of it, I hadn't seen that tie for ....Jeeves was speaking again, ""I took the liberty of presenting the tie to my friend Gilbert, mistaking it for certain unwanted items of clothing you had asked me to dispose of earlier."" Proudfoot was having nothing of it. ""Gilbert, my foot!"", he exclaimed. ""A likely story. I don't know any Gilbert!"" he said his face now bypassing red and settling at magenta.

Jeeves was unwavering. ""I regret to say"", he said, in a soft gentle voice, as if announcing a death, ""that my friend Gilbert is very well known to your lordship, though your Lordship may know him better by his surname. He is employed by your Lordship,"" he continued, almost in a whisper ""as gentleman's personal gentleman. ""Your Lordship"", he continued, unnecessarily, I felt, ""may know him better as Brown.""

Proudfoot stood still for a moment. I noticed, not without some satisfaction, that the magenta had faded from his face, replaced by a pallor that made Jeeves offer him some brandy. ""I am sure there is some perfectly innocent explanation"", he murmured gently. ""A certain degree of disarray of the clothes is not uncommon in the state of sleep"", he added, adding something about the sweet innocent sleep that nourishes life. ""Disarray is not the word I would choose"", murmured Proudfoot darkly. ""But what is your proof?"" he asked, suddenly suspicious.

Jeeves produced an elegant piece of notepaper. We read, ""Received, two purple Drones club ties, in good condition, two black trousers."" And under a scrawly signature, the words Gilbert Brown. Old Proudfoot sank into an armchair. In a last, feeble attempt, he asked ""Why would you collect a receipt for clothing you give away?"" ""Before I entered Mr Wooster's employment"", Jeeves said, ""I was in the Duke of Chiswick's employment. There was a somewhat disagreeable situation regarding the Duke's clothes which had been given to the gardener. The clothes were later found in a summer house in the Duke's grounds in the company of one of the kitchen maids. If the gardener hadn't been found hiding in a tree near the scene, in a state of undress that was most unsuited to the winter cold, the Duke could have experienced some degree of embarrassment.""

As Proudfoot trudged to the door, Jeeves added, ""May I suggest to your Lordship, that knocking at a door before entering, is a habit which if cultivated, often saves much embarrassment. When I was in the employment of the Duchess of ..."", his voice trailed off as the door clicked shut. ""Poor Brown, ""I said. ""I believe he may be in for a rough time."" ""I fancy not,"" said Jeeves. ""I took the liberty of telephoning him shortly after I saw the socks in his Lordship's hands. ""Brown, though an excellent man in many ways, has a weakness for the ladies. I first met him when he was a gardener in the employment of the Duke of Chiswick.""

""After his uncomfortable winter night up the tree, he gave up gardening....."", Jeeves voice trailed off as he shimmered away to the kitchen to make tea.

The Great Gatsby la avru ezhudhraaru:

“The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.”

Indha maadhri visual ah ezhudhradhuku, verum writing skills irundha mattum podhumnu namba nenaippom. Aana adha thaandi namaku innoru mukkiyamana skill venum: observation skills.

Why Observation is Critical to Writing Visually

Adhu irundha dhan endha vishyathayum creative details oda namlaala solla mudiyum. Nalla writers-kum mokka writers-kum irukra periya vithyasamae indha observation skill dhan. No amount of creativity and writing chops can compensate for the lack of observational skills.

Take this following description by Toni Morrison for example. Sooriyan sayangalaam marairadhu oru simple aanuh event. But adha avru epdi describe panraaru-na:

“By the time they reached the field, the sun was lowering and its glaze slid down the bright blue buttercups. The grass lay down as though it were swept. The flowers looked at the beaten-down grass until the night left them alone and the sun came back.” – from the novel Beloved.

Verum “the sun set” nu summa solradhukum, the sun was lowering and its glaze slid down the bright blue buttercups nu solradhukum evlo vithyasatha iruku la? The latter lines immediately send us visualizing the sun setting behind those trees or hills.

A small observation dhan, yet it makes a huge difference. The keener we observe, the more vivid our writing becomes.

How Does Travel Enhance Your Writing?

Oru writer indha maadhri subtle observations-uh different different landscapes, cities, and places la pannum bodhu, avnuku neraya inputs kedaikum thannoda work la use panradhuku. Indha inputs could be anything like an interesting event, phenomena, interesting characters, stories of places nu enna venumna irukalam.

On top of that, travelling sparks epiphanial moments. Oru epiphanial moment uh experience panna oru writer ezhudhra description of that moment will have an insane level of intensity and heightened creativity.

It’s for the same reason why detail-oriented writers neraya travel pannanuvaanga. They carefully collect these moments and memories that they can later use in their art.

New Place, New Inspirations

Neraya artists paatheengana avanga work panra edatha suthi artistic and creative things ah vechirpaanga. Adhu paintings ah irukalam, home decor, sculptures, posters nu enna venumnaalum. Adhu en na, looking at these creative objects when the artist is sitting with his thoughts will spark new ideas and inspiration.

1jqbimy,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1jqbimy/in_pain_and_frustrated/,In pain and frustrated,"I had an ACDF in 10/2023 for right arm/hand numbness in C4-C7. In Dec/Jan of 2024 I had some of the same symptoms in my left hand in November 2024, but imaging showed nothing. Steroid shot seemed to help it… life moved on. Diagnosed with Breast cancer in December 2023. 5 surgeries, including double mastectomy and reconstruction. 

Fast forward to January 2025. Left forearm pain, plus tingling in my pinky and ring finger. Weakness followed within a week. I’m at the point that I can barely pick up a coffee cup without coffee in it. 

MRI from Sunday 3/30 shows progressive foraminal stenosis at C2-3, two new herniated disks pressing on nerve roots at C7 and T1. Moderate to Severe. 

Neurosurgeon’s MA called me today and said “Dr X is opening up appointments Tuesday 4/4 and wants to see you. What time can you be here in the morning that day?” (Note…this surgeon is booked out into August, yet he’s coming into office Tuesday to see me. I know what this means.) 

I just want to cry. I don’t want another surgery or fusion. They are so painful. 
I had 5 tough breast cancer surgeries last year. 6 wound vacs. I want to spend my summer having fun. Not recovering again. 

I have a new job that I LOVE (but it’s not full time, meaning no pay while I’m not working.) I’m traveling across the country for work and have recently lost 25lbs. Except for the severe arm weakness and pain, I’m doing great.

I have a new grandson. I’m in a really good place. 

Hubby and I planned a cruise for later this summer because we couldn’t travel last year. 

Please say a prayer for me that my company can put me to work doing some data entry or something to this effect while I recover. 

I so damn frustrated that my body is doing everything it can to fall apart. Sorry… just needed to vent. I’ll update after I see my surgeon on Tuesday morning. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

 I broke up with my partner of 5 years realizing I had fallen out of love with him. I wrote this about our last meal together. 

*************

It’s in the air they say.
It is that time of year after all.

The diner’s bathed in it. We bleed.
Crimson roses; couples delight.
We sit under crepe paper hearts and twinkling lights.
The music crones like romcom credits.
We take tentative bites; our movie’s ending.
I sit across from him meekly staving off the tears.
Last supper unceremoniously held in our favorite spot for years.

I watch his pain seep out at the pores.
I look up and away failing terribly to ignore.
It wells in me too under a sky so laden. 
Clouds hang heavy with the feelings I’m evading.
Our duration of ____  now domineered by doom. 
In crashes the waves and the storm no longer looms.
Our maps in the sand begin to erase.
My salad sours; lukewarm coffee to chase.
The erosion commenced long before I’d disclose it.
My heart wouldn’t believe and upstairs I loathed it
For so damn long our sky was bright blue

“I never dreamed of a life without you”

With god as my witness for so long I meant it!
Now a weak whisper, echoing; demented. 
These swatches of color you once painted so brightly.
Dulled and diminished like the fire inside me.
Around each corner I still will see you.
But our memories now fade, greying in hue. 
Your levis give way; you accidentally spill my drink. 
Rushing to the bathroom to white knuckle  the sink.
I’m thrusted back to the present painful lunch I insisted.
I choke down my plate with grief illicit.
You still look at me with so much love.
I ask for the check.
I want to take you back but this ship has already wrecked.
This life we had planned I fed to the shredder
Outside it rains hard; thought we couldn’t be wetter.

I’m looking for a beginner friendly and not so expensive grinder to grind coffee by myself. My standard amount is ~ 48-50g of coffee powder. After some research in this sub and the www I’m lost what are my options. I would prefer a manual grinder. Is there a grinder which covers my requirements ?

1jqb3pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jqb3pa/i_feel_lost_and_confused/,I feel lost and confused,"Okay, some background information to understand what happened...I'm a gay man in an open polyamorous relationship with 2 other men, one I have been with for 5 years, we'll call him Anthony. My other partner, Logan, we've been with for 2 years. Thats background on my relatiinship. To set the scene, picture it, I made some online friends, also gay. I had been gaming and chatting with them for a couple of months and we decided to meet in person. We met, we vibed and chilled. We clicked and made plans for them to meet my partners as well cuz they wanted to expand their friend circle. I was totally down for that idea. So we made plans for an upcoming weekend. This brings us to the events of this story. 4 days ago, Saturday night, my friends came over to meet my partners and hang out. Prior to them coming, Logan informed me that other people would be coming as he wanted to celebrate graduating his second term of cosmetology school, and I was totally down for that! Logan's ex-husband shows up with some wine and tequila. Shortly after, my friends showed up. Myself, my friends, Anthony, and Logan's ex sat down to play Cards Against Humanity. A few minutes later, Logan walked through the apartment to go pick up more of our friends who were coming over. While he was gone, his ex ran to the liquor store to buy more tequila as they had drank most of the first bottle already. My friends and I went to the store to buy dinner for everyone, just some frozen pizzas. We came home and I was pre-heating the oven and opening some of the pizzas. While I was doing this, Logan and Anthony came inside and went to my bedroom. Anthony came back out and told me that Logan wanted to talk. I said okay and I'd be there as soon as I got the pizza in the oven (would have been literally just a few more seconds). Anthony goes back to my room and Logan comes out and says that the ""waterworks are about to start so we can do this right here right now, or you can come to the bedroom right now."" He went to the bedroom and my friends said they would go ahead with the pizzas. I went to my bedroom and Logan instantly started saying that he could see that his replacements were here and that he could see that he wasn't wanted or loved and that he would be out of the apartment come Monday. I asked him what he was talking about? He repeated what he said and clarified that he was talking about my friends. I reminded him that they were here to meet him and Anthony and asked where this was coming from. He went off and said that he saw this coming for a while now and was going to leave. I again asked him what he meant and he started crying saying that he doesn't deserve any good things happening to him and has to worry about his grandmother dying in our living room and that he's going to have to live with burying her just like he buried his mother. (For clarification, we housed his grandmother for two weeks im my apartment on hospice care because she has late stage dementia and had just been released from the hospital. She has since been moved out of our apartment to a better hospice facility so that she'd have constant around the clock care) He continued by saying that he shouldn't have to go through all of this and that no one deserves his baggage. At this point our next door neighbor, who is like a mom to us, comes into the bedroom and starts talking to Logan, trying to calm him down. At this point, he was crying and hyperventilating and repeating that he doesn't deserve good things happening to him because of all his baggage and that no one should be with him because of his baggage. He's laying on the bed at this point and Anthony and I have him by the hands while our neighbor has put pressure on his legs and talking to him on a calm, soothing tone. (The reason for the pressure on his legs was so we could try and make him feel grounded because he was freaking out, spiraling, and hyperventilating again). He asked us to let him stand and once on his feet he started talking about how he should just take care of every6by jumping off the third floor of our apartment complex. We all told him to quit talking like that and he started hyperventilating again. He said if we didn't let him outside to smoke a cigarette he would jump out my bedroom window. I let him out of the room and he grabbed all of his friends and went outside. My friends asked me if everything was okay and offered me some pizza. I told them I didn't know what was going on and they asked if they should leave so we could figure things out. I told them they should leave and apologized for the night going this direction. They seemed totally understanding and we agreed to plan something again soon. (At this point I was unsure if they had heard anything Logan had said about them being his replacements). They left and an hour or so later Logan came back inside and our friends were ripping him a new one and calling him out for some things he had apparently said about me and Anthony while they were all outside. Logan kept screaming about him getting replaced so I asked him who was replacing him and why he thought he was being replaced. He ignored and kept talking to his friends. My friends told him to answer me. One of his friends had gotten up and stepped in front of him. Logan then turned and kicked our coffee table and broke some things that were on the table. One of his friends grabbed him so he couldn't do anything else and he either tried to tackle his friend or punch him. I wasn't sure, everything happened so fast. As soon as all that happened I called the cops as that was the first thing I thought to do. Ligan started yelling that this is what I wanted all along and that I wanted him out of the picture and rotting in jail. During this, I was explaining to the operator what happened. They generated a report and said that officers would be there soon. (SPOILER ALERT* They never showed!!!). After I got off the phone, Logan stopped yelling g and just started saying extremely nasty, hurtful, hateful, and cruel things about me, to me, and just doing anything he could to hurt me. I just stood there quietly and took his words on the chin, trying not to give him the satisfaction. After a few minutes of his taunts and remarks he ran towards me and the rest of our friends and our neighbor grabbed him and held him while I ran to the door. Logan then bit someone's finger and headbutted the same person. (I should have called the cops again and there was blood drawn from this but I was stunned, shocked, and scared). I grabbed our neighbors husband and he replaced his wife with holding back Logan. She brought me to her place and sat me on her couch while she went back to try and calm Logan down. After what felt like ages, Logan ended up leaving with his ex and two of our friends and stayed st his exes house that night while Anthony and I stayed at the apartment. 

The next day, Anthony and I talked about what happened I told Anthony that I was totally through with Logan and didn't want to be with him anymore and that I wanted him out of the apartment. Anthony agreed that Logan needed to move out and that he was torn about breaking up with him but definitely said he was going to be talking with Logan about what happened. A little while later, Logan asked Anthony, who asked me, if he could come back to the apartment. I said yes, hoping that he was coming home to talk and apologize. He did talk, but not to me. He talked with our friends and with Anthony, in his room, with the door shut. But not once did he speak with me. He had come back to the apartment around 10am btw. Logan had exited his room several times throughout the day but he never looked at me, spoke to me, he did nothing. Avoiding me like I was the plague. He eventually left the apartment with Anthony and went to a bar where he had a scheduled event going on that he was hosting. He went to bar instead of apologizing to me for what he did. I should not that every time a door opened and shut after Logan came home, I found myself flinching and eventually realized that I didn't know what state of mind Logan was in and had no clue if he still wanted to came at me the way he tried to the night before.

They came home a couple of hours later and went to bed. Logan still did not talk to me.

The next day, this would be Monday. I get to work and message Anthony to let me know if anything happened that day. I got a message back later in the day that Logan was checking himself into a hospital for some kind of mental health observation. I was happy to hear that but still hurt that Logan still hadn't said anything to me.

Fast forward to today, Wednesday. I had been informed that Logan was being released to come home today. I told Anthony that I am sticking to what we discussed and that I didn't want Logan living here anymore. Anthony said that Logan didn't have anywhere to go. I asked Anthony how he would feel if I did to him what Logan did to me and then decided to go to a bar the next day instead of apologizing or talking to him. I asked him how he'd feel if that happened and he remained silent. I asked him if Logan had anything to say to him about why he wasn't talking to me and all he said was that Logan didn't speak to me Sunday because he thought I was scared of him. This pissed me off and walked away. It is now passed midnight and Logan still has not said one word to me since Saturday night.

I am confused about how Anthony is responding to this situation and I feel lost because I'm not sure if I'm overreacting as this type of situation has never happened to me before. 

I would really appreciate some reddit advice about this whole mess. What do I do? ",2,1743661083.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
