She was a big part of my life growing up, but I’ve been estranged from her and her kids for seven years. 

Her death brings up a lot of mixed feelings for me because of what’s happened with her, her brother, her kids (my cousins, Martín and Julia), my brother and myself.

Martín stole from me when I worked for the family business. He also treated my brother, Andrés, like shit when Andrés worked there, humiliating him over and over again. One example is he reduced my brother’s commission every time he exceeded sales targets, which is also a dumb move tbh.

Eventually, Andrés quit, taking his entire client list with him and started his own business. That hit the family business hard, and the fallout split the family in two—those who sided with Andrés and those who sided with my uncle, Roberto (my mom’s brother), and Martín. At this time Andrés had a son and none of the people mentioned here reached out. My nephew is seven years old and none of them have met him.

I stayed out of it until Franco, another cousin on my dad’s side who was also like a brother to me, was murdered. I flew back to Mexico for his funeral, and neither Martín, Julia, their mom or Roberto showed up or called. I decided to end my relationship with them. If they won’t show up when it matters especially given the way they behaved in a business setting, what is the point of having them in my life? I have tons of friends I can have coffee with when I go back home.

I wrote them letters explaining exactly why I was going no-contact. I told Martín he was a liar and a thief and called out how he’s been going around saying he paid for my dad’s funeral when it was Andrés and me who covered every expense. I told Julia that after 45 years of friendship, her silence when Franco died said everything I needed to know. And I told Roberto that he’s a piece of shit for exploiting my family and stealing part of my mom’s inheritance. I summarized each thing he’s done—stealing money, humiliating my mom, asking my brother if my dad’s cancer treatments were worth the cost. I told him I hope he dies like my dad did, in pain.

After that, my aunt called my mom to say she never wanted to see her again. I retaliated by calling her a cunt. A few hours later, I called her back to apologize for that, but I didn’t apologize for the letters, and I never contacted Martín or Julia again.

My aunt remained no-contact with my mom for two years but eventually reached out, and they reconciled. She never wanted to see me or Andrés again, though, and she refused to meet my nephew (Andrés’s son).

Now she’s dead. I feel a small pang of regret. My partner suggested sending a note of sympathy to my cousins as an olive branch. Another of my mom’s siblings suggested the same to my brother. When I looked back at my hate docket which is a list of grievances, and the letters I wrote, I got furious all over again. I called my brother for his perspective. He reminded me that they didn’t even bother to go to Franco’s funeral and that is when he himself decided they were no longer family to him either and there was no possible reconciliation.

So I know what i want to do and my brother and I are aligned in remaining no contact. But I’d like a reality check and some perspective.

Earlier I made a post about meeting for a coffee/breakfast tomorrow. 95% of the messages I got were from men out of my age preference or had post histories commenting on porn/looking for hook ups so obviously I didn't want to meet them. I don't understand how you wouldn't get why a person wouldn't want to meet you when your post history is basically a jerk off session. 

I made a second post requesting to meet other women my age for breakfast and walk, with potential to organise board gaming or meet ups for markets.

Then I start getting messaged this. 

This stuff isn't uncommon. Men won't make their own posts to meet with other people or only want to meet women, ignore boundaries, and like with this guy still try get you to meet them in an attempt to ""convince"" you they're worth meeting.

I (29F) have a friend from college (28M) that I ran into at a concert last year, and it took me by surprise. We'd kept in contact somewhat over the years, but limited to occasional IG comments/replies, etc. This was the first time seeing him in person in a long time and when we saw each other I could swear he looked like he'd had received an answer from God. We hung out during the concert until he had to leave early (was living in another state at the time), and while I mostly was paying attention to the music, when I was chatting with him I could swear there was a vibe. 

We agreed to meet up again soon and with help from a friend I initiated. In my mind it was a date, and the first I'd had in 3 years after a very bad breakup, but it also felt casual enough that it could have been interpreted as a hang out. When we met up, it was nice but there was loads of awkward pauses and I felt like we were mostly stiff with each other until we got a drink towards the end. He had a family thing to go to too so it was rushed, and ultimately I'd thought maybe I misread and it just wasn't a match, but I appreciates that he paid for the meal.

A few weeks later I realized his step dad was this doctor I was interested in seeing but couldn't find where he worked anymore. Details from the conci clued me in and I told myself I'd make an appointment, but I didn't until almost a year later, this past spring. When I did i poked this kid again for the information and he mentioned that he had a new job, which turned out to be very close to where I live, and we agreed to meet up again.

During the doctor visit, I got along with the doctor/his step-dad, who disclosed a bit about this kid including how he'd been really ambitious during college and even tried overloading on his classes despite going through chemotherapy. I'd never known that, and I was quite shocked to learn it. When we met up later, I never mentioned it, but it made me think he might be someone with a lot more depth than meets the eye to have that kind of internal strength. This time around I was slightly more relaxed, and while there were still awkward moments, I was more comfortable in myself since our previous meeting and I was able to push past them/my shyness. He again paid for everything, no question, was very kind, but we only hugged after so I thought maybe it was just a friend hang out.

Not long after, we were joking on IG after I sent a reel and he suggested us meeting up for a yoga class at the Y. He ended up calling them first thing in the morning to ask about the class, confirmed with me the time and date, and even checked in the day before to tell me when he'd be there. I felt like that level of detail meant it could have been a date, and when I got to the class he had already gotten me a mat and everything in a spot next to him. We ended up kissing after a walk and some tea, and we talked about seeing each other soon but were both busy.

We met a couple times in June but only for small windows of time because of how my schedule worked out. He was always very accommodating to it. We'd kiss and he was very respectful while still managing to squeeze me in a way that drove me insane. One of the hang outs resulted in us getting very into it, and when he dropped me off in his car we got especially handsy. I touched his crotch outside his pants and he let me briefly before gently pushing my hand away. I also took his hand to my upper thigh because I was interested in him fingering me, and he felt my thigh and squeezed it, but didn't go further than that, and made sure to pull my dress over so I'd not be exposed to anyone else. 

We didn't meet or talk very much after and I got worried maybe I scared him off. Eventually I suggested us meeting after work for dinner and he agreed. We were both busy again but he was willing to work around it and see me despite also having to meet family before a cousin left for college. We decided on meeting for lunch instead, but the day before he ended up being in his step-dad's clinic with IV cuz he'd gotten sick after traveling thr weekend before. He STILL met with me the next day, picked me up, was super sweet while we went for coffee even though he couldnt have anything, was attentive, listened to my work problems, etc. I gave him a few kisses on the cheek cuz he was sick, but I left that date with such a smile on my face. 

Up to this point I'm only seeing positive signs. I was busy all through august, and in September I messaged him a couple times, and he always responded with his normal style and enthusiasm, but I felt like since touching his crotch maybe I was initiating more. I told him about this film festival and we agreed to catch a movie, but I felt a bit bothered that at the end he thanked me for inviting him out when I'd thought he invited me. 

Then a few weeks ago I sent a really nice pic of me from the gym and it got very flirty while still being quite polite. We agreed to go to a yoga class on Halloween, and it was very nice. Got some food and drinks after, and overall it was a nice time. He dropped me back off at my place and we made out in his car. Ended up on top of me in the passenger seat (we're both on the smaller side) and kissing my breasts, we both felt each other's crotches over our clothes, but it still got very hot and heavy and it was great. 

We stopped there and I mentioned to him thst I thought he was nice, how he made me horny, he's sweet, and that i had a small crush on him. I know I wasn't the clearest, but I tried asking where his head was at by saying I'd be disappointed if he only thought of me as a fwb, that I wasn't looking to cuff anyone but thats where I was. He kinda hemmed and hawed and said something like ""so many life choices"". He said he probably felt similar to me but that I felt stronger, which I said was maybe just attraction. He said if there was a fork in the road and he had to choose thst he was leaning more towards fwb.  I said it was fine, I'd see him around, and after a couple min I left and went inside. 

Since then we've a couple times. He started out by sending an album on spotify, and we've shared a couple IG reels, but haven't said very much. It doesn't seem too different from his style, he seems to speak in lots of one liners or he'll do a paragraph. But I'm holding back more in part to save face, in part because I'm shy, etc.

I've gone on some tinder dates since then. They weren't great, not thst that's a great venue, but it made me realize that I still would like having this guy around. I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket, but I like his company and we get along well. I love how he treats me, he's always so sweet and a real gentleman without it being overbearing. I like getting to know him and his character, I like that he seems to have like a quiet confidence, and I feel like he's someone who would be very caring in a relationship. And all the while I'm *very* aroused by him despite him not being my usual type. I also feel like usually when guys are about fwb they really try rushing into things more and aren't so attentive or anything. I don't want to be exclusive yet but I also don't want to let this go either. Idk how to do that without feeling like I'm initiating or begging. I worry maybe because I tried feeling him up thst maybe he thinks I'm not worth the effort or anything. Idk. I'm very inexperienced overall and I second guess myself so much in this area. 

How do I continue seeing this kid? Am I wasting my time? Was he just being a nice guy but not that into me like I'd thought? ",1,1732859880.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1h2ehdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1h2ehdt/is_it_just_me_or/,Is it just me or,"Are third spaces dying since quarantine? Like parks, public libraries, things of that nature. Depending on your definition it may or may not involve places where you’re expected to buy something in order to be there (like a cafe).

Where I live at least places like that are quickly dying out. I know I sound like an old person saying this, but in 2019, at least where I lived, there were loads of places you could just go to hang out and no one would have a problem with it. You wouldn’t even be expected to buy anything. There were tons of public parks.. You didn’t even have to pay to enter. I also enjoyed frequenting the cafés because they were a nice place to read, study, or even just hang out that wasn’t my dorm room. 

I often had issues studying in the dorm because there were no windows and it made me feel claustrophobic. Back then, they allowed me to set up and work for hours on whatever and didn’t even expect me to buy anything. The only condition is that you behaved yourself and you couldn’t use their bathroom unless you bought something.

It may just be my location, but I noticed that once quarantine was over a lot of the public parks that used to be free now required you to pay to enter. Sometimes you had to pay over $20. unless this is just my city, pretty much every café will require you to buy something. A lot of them will only let you use the Wi-Fi if you spend over a certain amount of money. So if you want to go there to study, you can’t just buy a three dollar coffee and set up. as a matter of fact, any place you can go to sit down and eat, seems to be disappearing. Most restaurants, cafés, and places of that nature are drive-through at least where I am. If they aren’t drive-through, there’s no place to sit and eat inside, it’s all takeout.

As for the libraries? Many of those shut down. I live in a pretty large city. There are many libraries, but most of them aren’t open to the general public. Most of the libraries around here are affiliated with the many colleges and universities that are in this area. If you’re not a student at that specific university, you can’t go. There is one public library that you don’t have to pay for, but that’s very far away from here. I’m told that they’re used to be a very large public library. Only a few blocks from where I live now but it got shut down in 2021 along with many others.

In front of my apartment building, there are some benches where you can just sit and talk with people, but there’s an unspoken rule about staying there longer than a couple of minutes. If you do, the cops will start getting suspicious and ask you to leave. 

I apologize for whining. I just wish they were places I could chill that aren’t work, college, or my apartment.    ",1,1732857523.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

------------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/uGLJNnnu3N): **October 17, 2024**

My husband 36M and I (34F) had been married for 8 years, together for 14, and we have a 4 years old daughters that is our whole life.

He had been married before with Eliza, his best friend. They married at 18 and lasted 2 years and divorced. They remained best friend and when we started dating, Eliza; my husband's other best friend, Jack and my husband were a tight knit. Eliza was ""one of the bros"" and I always was ""the girlfriend"" and later ""the wife"" always an outsider, his two friends are single, so our house was always a place to crash. Even since we moved together they would show unannounced and do their own thing while I made snacks and full meals. For the first yeard I tried my best to integrate into their clique but never worked out. It was always akward and I felt I was inserting myself where I didn't belonged so I stopped trying and relegate myself to be great host and let them do their things.

I didn't notice at first but over the years resentment had build. I feel like a 50's house wife serving drinks and lighting cigarrettes to men.

My husband on his own is amazing and love him. He had been a great partner and my bestfriend during this 14 years. Problem is I'm not his best friend, Eliza is.

Every single thing that happens in our life had tl be discussed and annalized with Eliza.

Early in our relationship I got pregnant, I took the test early in the night and we were really scared, despite this he was so reassuring with me holding me the whole night and told he was ready to do whatever I wanted to do. I said I needed to really think about it. Next day we went to our classes and agreed to lunch together.

When we met, he asked me how I was and all, then told he had the contact of a doctor who did abortions (it was illegal back then) I asked how he found one so fast when wasnt sure what to do. Answer: he called Eliza early in the morning and she had a friend. I felt so betrayed because this was something that belonged to me and he went and shared it with someone else, ""not just someone else is Elizs, come on!"", he said.

During the next days everytime I saw him he has new information from Eliza and Eliza's friend. I was so confused and scared, and Eliza convinced my boyfriend we needed to it fast because it would be easier. It was so much pressure I agreed long story short it was a rat hole doctor office and I almost died there.

To this day I don't know if I should had kept the baby or no. But better not think about it.

When my boyfriend propossed Eliza was ""fake mad"" he didn't said first to her he was going to propose to me. The only way to placate her was to has her as a best man, despite my husband having a male best friend.

Every little or major event in our life turns into ""yeah, I'm gonna tell now Eliza you know how she gets""

I was SA as a child and told this to my husband, he was the first person I talked about it. Months later Eliza and I were alone in out kitchen and she started to talk about something she heard in the news about a girl raped my a family member and then hugged me.

When I started to try for a child and I got pregnant I asked my husband to kept this for us for a little. It was wednesday, sunday when I saw Eliza she congratulated me. I ended up miscarrying.

I started to look for a doctor to help me deal with my depression, again, something I wanted to keep to myself. Eliza was so understanding.

When I was pregnant with my daughter, Eliza came full of advice on things I should do. I told her to mind her own bussines wich really hurt her feelings. I stood on my ground and told my husband I wasn't going to raise my kid with Eliza and didn't wanted to hear any advice from her.

This was a big fight with my husband becaude I was rude and Eliza was family and already considered herself and auntie. This had been the only time I had given an ultimatum to my husband ""Eliza better keep herself away from my motherhood or will leave""

Now resentment has reached a point when I don't want her near me or my house or my husband.

I feel she is more married to my husband than I.

My whole life feels like I live best friends to lover drama.

I'm not sure why I'm writings this. Probably because I'm alone in a coffee shop and thinking I want my husband to be my husband and not feel like a lame love interest in someone else epic love story.

In the past my husband thought I was being childish. Despite loving him I cant keep to be married like this. I dont feel I can trust to talk to him again without involving Eliza, I don't want to hold an ultimatums.

TL;DR My husband is best friend with his ex wife. I dont trust him anymore.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Wow, that's a really heavy one. Have you confronted him when he told her stuff you wanted to be between you two?

> **OOP:** Yes I did. He always acts like ""is iust Eliza, I needed to talk out with someone, he needed support, outside perspective , to vent""

**Commenter 2:** Well, you almost died because Eliza recommended a quack for your abortion.

Honestly, I don't know. Probably an ultimatum would work, but you said you don't want to give him one. Maybe couple therapy? Either that or divorce, you seem to be at the end of the rope.

PS: has Eliza been seeing someone all this time? Were they alright with her connection with your husband?

> **OOP:** Before I had my daughter I gave him a ultimatum or either he and Eliza respected my motherhood and she kept her opinions to herself or we were done.
> 
> I dont want to just keep giving ultimatums to keep my marriage.
> 
> Honestly, I don't even know if counseling would work because I don't think he see a problem so he would probably go and has a drink with her and tell about the counseling.

**Commenter 3:** Exactly! Seems like OP wasted her time being the third wheel in her own relationship and ultimately her marriage. Giving ultimatums and then not following through is just a waste of words.
> 
> **Commenter 4:** Yeah he knows she won’t do anything so he’s not going to change.
>> 
>> **Commenter 3:** Yup! That’s why it’s been 14 years and she’s pretty much the side chick, just how her husband and Eliza like it. She stomps her feet and they laugh at her or completely ignore her and go back to their little bubble. Then the cycle repeats. OP should’ve left around the time of the abortion. The writing was on the wall in big bold capitalized letters.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** For the last 14 years everytime every time I express how I don't like our private life to be shared with outsiders he downplay it as needed to talk things about, to vent, his friends are his closes family, they wouldn't never judge. But I'm just right here if he needs to talk to vent o whatever. Then it comes like I want to isolate him.
>>> 
>>> I don't want to isolate him from people he cares I want to share my problems, our problems with him and only him.
>>> 
>>> This past 14 years I've thinking maybe I'm crazy and possessive. Maybe I'm toxic for not understanding how a strong friendship is.
>>> 
>>> Its only because now resentment has build, because I started to see myself as annoying characters between the two main characters.
>>> 
>>> I feel so down. I had given everything into my marriage.

**OOP on why her husband and Eliza divorced in the first place?**

> **OOP:** They married very young at 18 after dating for 3 months.
> 
> Their relationship was very intense in a good way at first then in bad bad way. They divorced 2 years later and discovered they were better off as best friends.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/UQffElmiwF): **November 22, 2024 (one month later)**

I'm gonna start saying how thankfull I'm to everybody that showed grace on my last post.

This isn't a happy update, if anything welcome to the pity, angsty train.

After writing my post and reading how most people felt about, my head was full of doubs and sadness. Your opinion isn't a surprise since most of my friends and family had voiced the same at some point. I guess I'm too slow and need to be punched harder to understand.

Few days after my post, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. Having a large family is what I (we) always wanted and ever since my abortion I was left with a feeling of having empty arms. So holding my daughter in my arms was like feeling whole again and know I need to grow my arms even more to hold my new baby too💫. But after the initial happiness a ugly feeling started to grow in my stomach. I didn't wanted Eliza in our life.

It felt like taking my inocence glasses out and I was able to see her. Like really see her. How every smile was so damn fake, every compliment was always mean spirit or kinda a self compliment ""nice potato salad it was great, oh, remember (to my husband) THAT potato salad I made it was kinda unbelievable blahblahblah"" or ""nice outfil I LOVE how confedent you are, I can't leave the house without making sure my outfit is flawless""

Her reaction to my first pregnancy, wedding, travels, my second pregnancy, buying a house. How everything that should be between my husband and I, always include her, like if our life was a play she should write and direct.

On our first christmas together she came when we were decorating and with all his positive cristics, I ended sitting in a corner drinking wine while she and my husband decorate.

She is always here. And by here I mean in my life. She has a say in everything in my life, to the point that when my husband voice his opinion I can say when these are his words and when are Eliza's.

I'm no saying that since I wrote the last post everybody turned into ultimate evils, but thinking and rethinking about my life with my husband, I had always been a pasive character, its like my husband got himself a pet and he and Eliza are going to be endgame when they both realize they never stopped loving each other.

Some of you, as my sister, will say I'm dormant. I guess I am. I have let this go for so long that it becomes normal. My life isn't bad, my hudband hasn't been a bad husband and Eliza isn't so bad if the bar is she hasn't tried to kill me yet. I know is clear to you all, but to me it have been my life for years, my day to day, I learned to look away and make me small so I don't make others uncomfortable.

Maybe because I'm pregnant and hormonal but I'm tired of this. I love my husband but I feel he can't love fully with Eliza whispering to his ear and him running like a golden retriever to please her.

So after all that thinking and rethinking I sat my husband down and told him we needed to set some strong boundaries because our marriage was working and I didn't feel loved or respected like a wife or even a person. I explained more of less what I said here. My husband denied everything and tried to explain himself saying Eliza was like a sister to him, I say even siblings have boundaries. It was back and forth, with him making me doubt if maybe I was in fact trying to control who was or wasnt in his life. Wanting to monitor his friendships and even joked if will need to sly away to have a drink with his buds. For a moment I feel maybe I was in fact crazy.

But I was firm into my ground: If he wanted to kept this marriage Eliza needs to be gone from our life.

At first I thought low contact was good but seeing his reaction I knew that wasn't going to be enough, maybe _I_ wouldn't bee seeing Eliza, but he certainly will do and I would be antagonized and mocked. Honestly knowing this made me realize my marriage was over.

So I asked important questions and pressed: what his real feeling were? Why they divorced if they where so hung into each other? Why no leave me sooner? Why no _leave me_? Did he loves Eliza more than me? Why? What is that? What is that, that I dont have and she does that makes her imposible to leave?

In a summary: he loves her, but he loves me, he doesn't understand how. Both of us bring something he doesn't want to miss. He is not sure if he wants a life with Eliza like the one we have, a marriage, a family. But she is his soulmate. They divorce because between then it was so much fire the were burning eachother, with me he has calm, peace and loving place to come back. He have never cheated, but admists he sometimes fantasies with her being me and me being her. They often talk about them having this life but agree that being together would break their bond. All fucked up, my god.

I know is was kinda obvious to you all on my first post and it should have been obvious to me, but hearing my husband saying he loves another woman that is his souldmate and he put her in the center of our life, made her an auntie to our daughter and somekind of sister in law to me, a suppose family friend. I'm not gonna lie, it broke me, I threw myseld in the floor and hugged his legs and asked him what I need to do to him to love me, to ONLY love ME. i felt so pathetic, but I believed everything was worth to save something with so much value like my marriage. I cried and cried and cried. And the hardest part was to hear there was nothing I could do.

This. This is all. I know isnt some shocking new, to me my life is falling appart, the only thing holging me up are two little hands that hug me every night and the small bean in my belly.

We haven't discussed anything legal yet. He left the house and my sister and mom and staying with us for now.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He’s a selfish cruel man. She is just as equally horrible. He used you and kept her around and she played along with it. He says he sees her as a sister but then says he fantasizes about her being you and you being her, both cannot be true at the same time. She is either a sister to him or he wants her to be his wife. All he does is lie. He was living his best life and got everything he wanted. He HAS cheated, maybe not physically (doubt it), but emotionally he has. You deserve to find someone who truly loves you and chooses you every single time and not someone who has another choice. You were their little doll to play with. You gave him all of these wonderful things so she didn’t have to, but she gets the perks of being your husband‘s girlfriend without ever having to get pregnant or do any hard labor in a marriage. I’m so sorry.

**Commenter 2:** While you're going through this transition, do not share details with him that you don't want Eliza to be privy to. Talk with your sister and your mother. Don't tell him about the baby until you're ready for her to also know. Invest the love you had for him back into yourself and your babies. Eliza doesn't want him, she wants the power in your relationship and the control. He's going to come crawling back to the family you built for him. Don't let him.

Khamrah qahwa- this is the perfect balance where the sweetness of the Khamrah is a bit toned down, but still a gourmand scent. Not sure what or where the coffee note is in this. Maybe my nose is not mature enough to catch the coffee note I guess.
Asad- I bought this cause all of my female friends liked it. But not really my cup of tea but yeah it’s wearable. If you want a spicy masculine alpha male scent then this is for you.
Afnan 9pm - my favourite of the four I guess. Nice sweet bubblegum fragrance. Great for winters, might even work all year round. I have to see how it holds in summer.

1h2e2mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h2e2mv/debating_reaching_out_to_my_ex_after_6_years/,Debating reaching out to my ex after 6 years,"To make a long story short(ish), I dated my first boyfriend for 5.5 years. He was my first love and my first everything. We ultimately broke up at 19 after our first year in uni because life was taking us in different directions and the stress was too much on the relationship. We took turns reaching out to eachother periodically over the last 6 years since we broke up, but we have not had any contact at all for the last 2 or so years. I’ve dated other people since, but nothing serious and I can confidently say my ex is the only guy I’ve ever loved. I’ve spent the majority of the last 6 years focusing on myself and doing things I’ve always wanted to do (travelling, moving to a big city, accomplishing career goals, etc). Our breakup was one of the worst things I’ve ever gone through, and it took me years to get over it, but I made peace with it over the last few years (or so I thought)

Last week I noticed he turned his snapchat location on for the first time in 6 years. He lives 20 minutes away from me. Ever since I’ve found this out I can’t stop thinking about him again. I’m even dreaming about him. We’ve lived hours apart for most of the time we’ve been broken up and knowing he’s so close is kind of unnerving to me. 

My therapist suggested asking him to coffee since I can’t stop thinking about him. At first I was completely against it because I don’t wanna seem like that ex that can’t let things go. I wouldn’t be expecting anything more than a coffee. I’m just curious to interact with him as adults I guess? It would also just be nice to catch up with him in general. I also recognize we’re both likely extremely different people than we were as teenagers, but I would be lying if I said there wasn’t some small part of me thinking that maybe it hasn’t worked out with anyone else because it wasn’t supposed to. Maybe I did get it right the first time. Maybe we just needed to grow up a bit independently before being together. It’s hard to describe but I just have this feeling in my gut that I need to reach out to him. 

Has anyone reached out to an ex years later? If so, what was the outcome? Would you reach out if you were me?

TLDR: just found out my first love now lives 20 minutes away from me and I can’t stop thinking about him now even though we’ve been split up for 6 years. Debating if it’s worth trying to reach out, even if it’s just to meet up for a coffee with no expectations of a certain outcome

In the cutthroat market of weight loss products, Trimtone has attracted a lot of attention because of its promises to help women burn fat, lower their need to indulge in unhealthy meals, and more precisely reach their fitness goals. Differentiating fact from fiction may be challenging in a market when so many products make similar promises. This is where the Reddit website excels. Reddit, well-known for its open and unfiltered discussions, provides a wealth of information from real individuals who have tested and assessed products like Trimtone.

To provide you a whole picture of Trimtone's effectiveness, we have merged knowledge from Reddit reviews, research papers, and the brand itself. If you're wondering whether Trimtone truly lives up to the hype, we've provided you with this information.

# Trimtone: How Does It Work?

Fundamentally, women were the primary focus of the creation of Trimtone, a natural fat burner. Trimtone's simple and understandable composition, consisting of only five active components, effectively boosts metabolism, reduces appetite, and promotes overall fat reduction. Unlike other weight-loss medications, which rely on ingredients not shown to be effective or unique combinations, Trimtone keeps a simple approach.

**The product presents three primary arguments regarding its advantages.**

1. thermogenesis, which boosts fat burning.
2. Reducing hunger can help one cut down on snacking and excessive consumption. Higher energy levels enable more effective daily workouts and activities.
3. Its once-daily dosage is convenient for ladies who are always on the move, setting it apart from competitors who require several pills throughout the day.

# What do Reddit users think of Trimtone?

Reddit people often turn to subreddits like r/loseit and r/fitness when it comes time to talk about their adventures with weight loss solutions like Trimtone. Despite differing points of view, there are recurring elements in these debates.

* Many customers have reported that taking Trimtone increases their energy level; they attribute this change to the caffeine component of the medication. Unlike other fat burners, it does not appear to produce the jittery feeling often connected with using too much amphetamine.
* Among the most generally lauded features of this medicine is its ability to stifle appetite. Women often discuss how Trimtone helps them prevent unhealthy snacking, which could be a major roadblock in the process of weight loss.
* Although Trimtone is not a magic pill, numerous users have claimed that it increases their energy levels and lowers their hunger, therefore helping them to follow their exercise and diet plans.
* Results Vary: Like any other product, Trimtone does not work the same way for every person. A few customers have complained of limited or poor results; they usually blame this on irregular use of the supplement or on the fact they did not mix it with a healthy lifestyle.

# Main Components and Their Benefits

Research-backed natural ingredients, rather than unnecessary fillers, form the foundation of Trimtone's recipe. Let's now take a closer look at the components of Trimtone's recipe.

* Caffeine, known for its stimulant properties, is believed to boost energy levels, enhance focus, and accelerate thermogenesis, the process of burning fat.
* Green coffee extract is believed to enhance fat metabolism and regulate blood sugar levels. It contains the green coffee's chlorogenic acid. 
* Rich in antioxidants, green tea extract helps muscles perform during exercise and promotes the burning of fat.
* This herb, a member of the ginger family, is less well-known, but studies have shown it to enhance thermogenesis and fat loss, potentially enhancing health.
* Glucomannan is a naturally occurring fiber that causes the stomach to enlarge, producing a feeling of fullness and aiding in the control of appetite.

# Existence of Scientific Support: Does It Work?

There is evidence from many research studies that Trimtone's ingredients work. For example, both green tea extract and caffeine are well-known for their ability to increase energy and burn fat. Researchers have conducted studies to determine whether glucomannan aids in reducing hunger, which in turn assists in maintaining a calorie deficit.

Like any other vitamin, its effectiveness depends on how well it enhances your diet and workout schedule. Trimtone is most beneficial when it is part of a well-rounded lifestyle rather than a stand-alone cure.

# Advice for Maximizing Trimtone's Benefits and Its Use

The simplicity of Trimtone's usage is among its most prominent benefits. Take one capsule with water first thing in the morning, before breakfast. Following this schedule will help you to ensure that the advantages of boosting metabolism start to show early in the day, therefore setting you up for success.

The best benefits would come from combining Trimtone with a healthy diet and regular exercise. While it may assist in controlling cravings and encouraging fat burning, the main objective of weight loss is to burn more calories than you consume.

# Reddit's Advice for Potential Buyers

Regarding weight-loss solutions like Trimtone, Redditors usually emphasize the significance of learning how to control their expectations. Although the product might provide a boost, it is not a replacement for constant effort and hard work. Many users suggest starting with goals that are realistic and using Trimtone as a tool that enhances your efforts instead of seeing it as a miracle cure.

You also have to pay close attention to the response your body shows. Those who have sensitivity to caffeine should start with a smaller dose or see a medical professional before taking the product.

# Where can I buy Trimtone without risk?

We recommend purchasing Trimtone from the [**official website**](https://www.mnqhs02jd.com/6W5KJZM/55M6S/) to ensure you are purchasing an authentic product. This guarantees that you will obtain a genuine product and helps you to take advantage of promotions and discounts the firm usually runs, especially for large orders. Avoid third-party merchants on internet markets like Amazon or eBay, as they may offer outdated or counterfeit goods.

# Is purchasing Trimtone a worthwhile investment?

Trimtone has developed a solid reputation over years among women looking for a simple, natural approach to lose weight. Reviews on Reddit, particularly when combined with a healthy lifestyle, emphasize how helpful this supplement is in raising energy levels, lowering cravings, and enabling weight loss.

Trimtone could potentially serve as a valuable aid in your weight loss journey, despite not being a miracle medication. Because of its simple ingredient list, simplicity of use, and positive customer remarks, it stands out in the competitive supplement market.

Trimtone may help you stay motivated and achieve your goals or continue your path. Find its potential right now, and find out how it could support you on your path to becoming a more confident and healthier version of yourself.

They will bring home groups of people after going to the bar at 4-5am and allow them to scream, stomp, etc, and i constantly wake up to these people sleeping on the couch. when they get home from work neither of them ever care to shut the door all the way. so our front door is constantly left cracked open as if it’s not a safety hazard (we are all women). They jack up our utility bills by constantly leaving lights on and never care to shut them off when they leave the house along with turning the heat on to 73-74, also not caring to turn it down when leaving the house for an extended amount of time. Not to mention that one of them keeps a space heater running 24/7, as if it’s not a fire hazard. They recently flooded both of our bathrooms because they have been flushing tampons and baby wipes down the toilet. i couldn’t use my bathroom and had to miss class because my bathroom was flooded with shit water for days. They also recently have left the refrigerator door open all night long while i wasn’t home.

Then, at 11:30 pm, we get paged for a STEMI, and don't leave until 2 am.

Pinaalis niya yung mga merchants na nagbebenta at nagpapalit ng pera sa templo. Nabasa ko din na yung binebenta pala dito ay mga *dove* para gamiting offering, at mayroon ding mga *money changers* na kailangan din para makapagbayad ng buwis yung mga nadalo dun.  
  
SO technically, Nasa templo sila ""para sa gawain"" no?, They have a purpose to why they are there in the first place. Pero hindi pa din to pinalampas ni Kristo. (Siguro ay dahil nga commerce, nagkaroon ng puwang sa corruption, nakawan, etc.) 

Jesus here, I think, is trying to emphasize the importance of preserving the purity of the place of worship.

I've been on a lot of first dates but not many second dates, so I asked her if she could take the time to know me and not give up on me too quickly. She said yes, and so I asked her on a date. I based the date on things that she liked, and she said that she wanted to do. She warned me that her English might be bad, but I said that it was ok and that I would be patient and respectful. 

On the date everything is fine and respectful. Her English is completely fine and I can't even tell that it isn't her native language. She shows me a lot of pictures on her phone. I am interacting with her phone and sometimes I would accidentally brush my hand against hers like doing so. She does not flinch or reject this, so I don't think anything of it. I ask if she wants to come back with me after the date to watch anime, but she declines. I'm completely understanding and even apologize for asking. I get back and she messages me that she had a good time, which I agree on.

The next day she is distant and stops replying to me. She posts a picture on her story with flowers and another guy. I comment on her steam profile (she has one friend on this account and its the guy) that I feel disgusted that she is willing to date any person in the world and that she lied to me about being patient. I express that I can't believe how self-centered she is. I block her everywhere, and an hour later I delete the comment.

Now her friends are messaging me from her. The message is:

""To the person who lost it under my Steam comments, you’re done for!!! You used the excuse of helping me learn English to ask me out, and when we met, I paid for my own coffee and didn’t let you spend a single penny. During the meeting, you kept trying to find excuses to touch my hand, which made me uncomfortable. I thought that adults not responding was a clear sign of disinterest, but instead, you went on Steam to spread rumors about me, claiming that I’m involved with many people. As someone who knows they’re unpopular and only targets Asian girls due to a “yellow fever,” you clearly underestimated the consequences of spreading false information. I’ve already taken screenshots of your words and am ready to print them out and post them around every corner of the school. If you think Asians are easy to bully, then you’re way too naive. I’ll make sure you, this loser, will always remember how high the cost of slander is!!!""

She is assuming a lot in this statement. She later claims that she does not have the comment that I posted, but that the guy she's newly dating asked her about it. She does not have any evidence of me doing any of this, but her friends are willing to support her with her claim.

Yesterday, nag-plan akong gumala. Nagtatatlong isip pa ako kung tutuloy ko ba kasi di ko rin alam saan ako pupunta. Not until I decided na I should go sa mga common tourist spot dito sa bansa. (di ko na disclose saan ako pumunta)

Okay naman yung una na-eenjoy ko yung lugar. Not until napunta ako sa parang mini museum. Paghawak ko pa lang sa pinto nag-kick agad yung thought na ""La, ba't parang nangyari na 'to?"". I let it slide lang kasi ang naisip ko pa that time is ""Parang napanaginipan ko na"". Tapos continue lang sa paglalakad hanggang mapunta sa maliit na tulay. Tapos again it hit me na ""Nakapunta na ba ako dito before? Alam ko first time ko dito."" Which is true. First time ko talaga sa lugar na 'yon. Ayon nga yung reason bakit doon ako pumunta kasi naisip ko na ""Ang hilig kong gumala tapos yung mga common tourist destination e di ko pa napupuntahan"". And mahilig ako mag picture at mag post so I know if nakapunta na ako sa lugar for sure may kahit isang picture man lang ako sa gallery ko. Pero wala kasi nga first time ko doon.

Tapos, nag stop ako sa coffee shop. After awhile umalis na rin tapos may madadaanan akong fountain and naghit na naman yung thought na ""Shet, why do I feel like I've been here before. Sobrang pamilyar nung lugar. Yung tulay. Yung fountain. Yung time of the day. Bakit parang nangyari na 'to?""

Marami na akong deja vu na na experience before. Pero ito talaga yung kakaiba sa lahat.

 Naka-uwi na ako tapos nung ni review ko yung mga picture at videos doon na naman pumasok sa isip ko pati yung mga pictures parang napicturean ko na rin before. Yung butterfly na vinideohan ko doon sa parang mini museum na pinuntahan kung saan una akong naka experience nung deja vu. Feeling ko na videohan ko na rin before. Actually, everything na nangyari kahapon, lahat ng pictures at video. Feels like nakuhanan ko na before. 


Pero wala akong copy miski isa sa phone ko. Tangina, iniisip ko tuloy baka nakakalimot lang ako ng memories. Hahayaan ko na lang sana pero everytime na nakikita ko yung videos at pictures nagpa-flashback yung mga nangyari kahapon na up until now feeling ko nangyari na before. And when I say ""before"" parang last year lang nangyari or this year. 

For sure not this year and even last year. Kasi first time ko talaga doon. Wala talaga akong memory na nakapunta na ako doon. And since common tourist attractions 'to baka isipin nyo ""Baka nung bata na nag field trip kayo"". Kasi never akong sumama ng field trip. So hindi talaga. Wala talaga. First time ko talaga doon.

1h2doqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1h2doqj/can_i_be_suspendedexpelled/,Can I be suspended/expelled?,"I (23M) went on a date a few days ago with a girl (23F) last weekend. I've been on a lot of first dates but not many second dates, so I asked her if she could take the time to know me and not give up on me too quickly. She said yes, and so I asked her on a date. I based the date on things that she liked, and she said that she wanted to do. She warned me that her English might be bad, but I said that it was ok and that I would be patient and respectful. 

On the date everything is fine and respectful. Her English is completely fine and I can't even tell that it isn't her native language. She shows me a lot of pictures on her phone. I am interacting with her phone and sometimes I would accidentally brush my hand against hers like doing so. She does not flinch or reject this, so I don't think anything of it. I ask if she wants to come back with me after the date to watch anime, but she declines. I'm completely understanding and even apologize for asking. I get back and she messages me that she had a good time, which I agree on.

The next day she is distant and stops replying to me. She posts a picture on her story with flowers and another guy. I comment on her steam profile (she has one friend on this account and its the guy) that I feel disgusted that she is willing to date any person in the world and that she lied to me about being patient. I express that I can't believe how self-centered she is. I block her everywhere, and an hour later I delete the comment.

Now her friends are messaging me from her. The message is:

""To the person who lost it under my Steam comments, you’re done for!!! You used the excuse of helping me learn English to ask me out, and when we met, I paid for my own coffee and didn’t let you spend a single penny. During the meeting, you kept trying to find excuses to touch my hand, which made me uncomfortable. I thought that adults not responding was a clear sign of disinterest, but instead, you went on Steam to spread rumors about me, claiming that I’m involved with many people. As someone who knows they’re unpopular and only targets Asian girls due to a “yellow fever,” you clearly underestimated the consequences of spreading false information. I’ve already taken screenshots of your words and am ready to print them out and post them around every corner of the school. If you think Asians are easy to bully, then you’re way too naive. I’ll make sure you, this loser, will always remember how high the cost of slander is!!!""

She is assuming a lot in this statement. She later claims that she does not have the comment that I posted, but that the guy she's newly dating asked her about it. She does not have any evidence of me doing any of this, but her friends are willing to support her with her claim.

1h2dguh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1h2dguh/life_stages_and_this_sub/,Life Stages and this Sub,"I love this sub. I'm pretty set in my current locale (Grand Rapids MI) but am always picking up interesting perspectives from reading these posts. 

One thing I think that isn't factored in enough is life stages and how responses can change for certain stages in life. For example, I honestly do not see the appeal of the vast majority of college towns... despite being a popular recommendation on this sub, for those outside of college, I think college towns are isolating, have sub-par facilities and experiences, and subject those older than college age to the adolescent indiscretions that many of us probably were involved in at that age, but have since moved on from. I enjoy going to a college town for a football weekend or some other event, but cannot wait to get back to my more mature and like-minded city after leaving. I dont think the energy or walkability outweighs the negatives to a locale generally catering to those who are 18-22.  

Similarly, I think this sub often just says ""go to Philly, NYC or Chicago"" without fully comprehending the question or stage of life that a person may be in. I think Philly and Chicago are fucking awesome cities (along with NYC, DC, SF, etc.). However, having access to 24 hour authentic bailenese food or the best concerts only really matters for so long. I'm 34 now, have a kid with a dog and a very pregnant wife, and my life is starting to revolve much more around optimization of time, convenience and other quality of life metrics in that same vein. 

Especially with remote work options, the drag of a major metro area, high cost of living and time spent in transit and just doing day to day activities no longer is something I want to deal with. I want to be able to get a hair cut, grab some fresh groceries and bakery and pick up my kid and dog from their respective daycares within a hour. I want to get together with friends and my family in 20 minutes. When I lived in DC, the haircut alone was a 55 minute ordeal. I absolutely love the energy of a big city, like seriously love it, but the livability has to be more important than the energy of the city or diversity of the food options at some point. 

I want this sub to keep these differences in mind. I'll say for myself, I hate suburbs, but I also know that I would hate trying to raise a kid (or several) in a dense city with little privacy or space. I'd prefer a higher-end suburb over trying to figure out how to handle children's needs in a very dense area. So Chicago or NYC would make no sense for me at this point (although I'd love both in my 20s).  What makes more sense to me is great schools, walkable and safe areas, ease of life, and definitely still great restaurants, coffee, bagels and those third spaces that I want to actually spend time in. But from all of my travels in the US, there are a lot of quality restaurants and fantastic third spaces in cities that aren't the most high profile 

I'm thankful that Grand Rapids offers me a pretty urban experience while also being able to live in a fairly large single family home for a decent price that is walkable / close to downtown. I feel like cities like Milwaukee, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Boise, Phoenix and other less sexy major cities may be able the same quality of life to those in similar positions to me. And while I presume the average person here doesn't have the same experiences or education as the average in NYC or SF, there are plenty of circles that consist of highly educated (ivy, top SEC / Big 10 educations), and cosmopolitan people that also have a nice dose of humility (I'd say my Grand Rapids circle falls into this camp). 

I'll continue to lurk on this sub, but my hope is that a few see this and we can pivot the focus from such a ""I'm in my 20s with no kids or responsibility"" mindset, and more to a diverse mindset that considers whether OP is a 25 year old, 35 year old with kids, 55 year old empty nester or otherwise ",11,1732853827.0,SameGrassButGreener,6,0.92,False
