Months of work creating a magnificent pile and turning it, but it was stuck at 52F, now that I had my brand new 3 ft thermometer to take readings.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jao2h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1jao2h3/next_restaurant_the_past_alinea_year_1_sunday/,Next Restaurant - The Past Alinea Year 1 - Sunday March 9th,"As a surprise, I took my wife out to Next's menu for Alinea Year 1 this past weekend.  We have been to Alinea several times, but nothing prior to 2011, so we were really excited about trying dishes from year 1.  Stopped in at The Aviary for a pregame drink - and of the 3 times we've done that, these were far and away the best cocktails I've had there.  

**Summary**  
Lovely time, the ""savory"" courses ranged from Great to Outstanding; the dessert dishes were meh to fine which was disappointing at an Alinea restaurant. First time for us at Next at all, was great ambiance and wonderful service.  Did the Ultra Wine Pairing, which similarly matched the meal in the the wines paired with the Savory Courses were on the whole outstanding, and the dessert pairings were fine, but disappointing. 

  
**Broccoli Stem** \- Opening course of course had caviar of some kind. Really great way to open the meal. Loved the interplay of broccoli and orange. Champagne paired with this was very clearly the best glass of Champagne I've had.

**Hearts of Palm** \- In pic - bottom was a garlic ""filling"", middle was Coffee, top was key Lime. Interesting plating. 1st and 3rd (Garlic and Key Lime) were the clear standouts for both of us. I enjoyed the Coffee 2nd one. Wife was indifferent to it. 

**Shrimp** \- This was fantastic. Great plating, fun, and out of this world flavor. 

**Lobster** \- Good god this was amazing. Rich, flavorful curry, different textures of Lobster, including ""lobster cheetos"". Just wonderful. 

**Tomato** \- This was the ""don't touch it and just eat off the wire"" thing. Tasted very good. Not sure that would have been on of my first choices to bring over from the first menu.

**Pork Belly (2 pix)** \- Very unique plating, as you put together the vessel to hold the spring roll wrapper. Recency bias and all, but my god, that might have been the best bite of food I've had in a long long time. 

**Hot Potato** \- How do I say this? You could put 50 courses of Hot Potato on my table, I'd eat them all, and have a smile on my face from ear to ear each one.  Still? Part of my wishes we could have gotten something not on current Alinea menus instead. 

**Frog Legs** \- My wife and I adored this. My first time with Frog Legs, and loved it. First of two dishes playing with Aromas. Pine branches covered in boiling water created an amazing pine aroma while eating.  

**Black Truffle Grilled Cheese (No pic)** \- Didn't get a pic. This was an add on to the normal menu, wife's birthday. Wife loves truffles. I get the add on.  Tasted great as I'm sure you can imagine. But was HEAVY. OMG this was a gut bomb.  Didn't really ""fit"" with rest of menu TBH and while I wouldn't say we regretted it, I'd definitely recommend to pass. 

**Lamb Neck** \- Next aroma course and this was the pillow one. Glad we got to try this, loved every aspect of it.

**Explosion** \- Exact same commentary as Hot Potato.  I can get this at Aviary for goodness sake.  Gimme something rare from year one. 

**Matsusake** \- And here's where (relatively) we drove off a cliff.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Honestly, flavor wise I've not had anything from any Alinea Group restaurant that  was less flavorful and ""boring"".  Sorry. 

**Spiral** \- Again. Fine. Great plating, looked fantastic. Flavor was fine, but this was the first dish I've ever had at any Alinea restaurant where I thought the easy ""style over substance"" criticism was valid. 

**Ultra Wine Pairing** \- Followed the meals in terms of enjoyment. First six wines paired with savory courses (1st four are white, 5 and 6 were reds) were out of this world. The Keller Riesling is in the team picture for favorite white wine I've had. The last two with desserts were mixed bag. The Nori liqueur was just weird. Love trying weird, so that was fine, but yeah, it was a weird taste/smell... Weird.  Again, not saying I don't want to be challenged, but I expected a lot higher quality vs a $35 liqueur for the Ultra wine pairing. The ending Sherry was great and to be clear I loved it, but wife is just not a sherry fan at all. I just... I dunno a bit shocked not getting some crazy rare European dessert wine in this pairing.  

**Overall** \- The Savory parts were outstanding. Dessert were disappointing. Service was wonderful. Happy I got to go. Wished we could have gotten more rarities vs bringing back two of the hits with Explosion/Potato.

1janyb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1janyb8/my_friends_decided_to_distance_themselves_from_me/,My friends decided to distance themselves from me and my boyfriend after I opened up to them about my arguement with him,"It all started when we were at a coffee shop a few days ago. Friend 1 and I were done with work immersion for the day and Friend 2 met up with us. So, we went to a coffee shop to rest and hang out. During that time, my boyfriend and I were arguing through SMS and Friend 2, who was beside me, noticed. 

For context, my boyfriend and I had a long period of arguements recently because of how he feels ‚Äòleft out‚Äô and ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô to me and my friends even when it‚Äôs not true. I would always reassure him that it‚Äôs not the case and I did my best to give both him and my friends equal attention. It put me off the edge when he would constantly bombard me with questions and statements about feeling left out or being lonely without considering how tired I was from work immersion. Not even a ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù or ‚Äúrest when you get home, okie?‚Äù were said. It was like I needed to be a rehabilitation center where I am always available to comfort or understand him based on how he feels. I have my limits too, you know? At that time, with a migraine and two blisters on both my feet, I had enough and that led to our arguement. 

Moving on, Friend 2 noticed my distress, and asked if I was okay. I was ready to become transparent with her so I became honest with my feelings. Then, the tears came out. I couldn‚Äôt control it. Friend 1 and Friend 2 were comforting me when I opened up how I really felt about that situation. I told them that I wanted to write a long concised message to my boyfriend about how I truly feel, at which Friend 2 asked if she could type it for me when I told them I don‚Äôt know the right words to say. Long story short, my boyfriend had a hostile reaction and now we were all battling through messages while I continue to tell my friends how I felt. I told them how I appreciate them for taking the time to listen to me and comfort me. I told them how grateful I was to have them. They were positive about it and we happily went home together, but I guess I was wrong. 

The following day happened and my boyfriend wanted to reconcile with me. He said he apologized for the harshful words he said and that he was not being considerate. He wanted to meet with me after work immersion to fix the problem and reconcile. I agreed, so after work immersion, we went to a nearby restaurant and had dinner. I told him that I opened up to both of my friends about the situation and I told him what their comments were, which set him completely off. Because of that, he texted both of my friends regarding what I shared. His message was respectful without any harsh tones. He apologized for what he did, but what made me feel off is when he added that they should ‚Äòknow both sides to the story‚Äô, which made the message sound conflicting. 

Friend 1 left him on read, but Friend 2 told him to stop defending himself and own up to his mistakes. She said all they did was to be my friend, which sounds right to me. However, she went on to say that, speaking for the two of them, they don‚Äôt benefit being between me and my boyfriend. They will distance themselves from me and him. They said that we always argue and it‚Äôs draining to always comfort me because of that. I understand their reason, but it was the first time I showed my vulnerable side to the both of them a few days ago. With Friend 1, sometimes but not all the time. Most of the time, I casually tell them but it never affected our friendship or our company, because I don‚Äôt want them to be involved. I still show my funny and approachable side with them, masking my true emotions. All I wanted was to know a third persons pov because I don‚Äôt even know if I am right or wrong with how I feel. I understand their reason, but I felt hurt that they will cut off any communication with me because of this incident. I just wish they would be honest with me and also become transparent with their side. I always consider how they feel when I opened up, given that I ask if I‚Äôm going too far, to which they deny and encourage me to open up even more. 

The pain of them not speaking to me because of this is almost unbearable. I apologized to Friend 2 for opening up too much without considering their feelings, to which she said it alright but left my next message on read . It‚Äôs the same thing with Friend 1. It feels like I have gone back to zero, where I had no friends in school until they came along. I never thought that this would happen.

My mission broke the illusion that the church would make me happy. I served 2 years in chile and hated who I became.

Deconstruction has been a slow process. I‚Äôve had to deconstruct each doctrine one by one and sift through what I believe in but I‚Äôm finally at the point where I do not believe it at all. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for stepping away from something that is harmful to me, unethical and simply not true. 

I‚Äôve kept my entire family in the dark about my deconstruction process. They know I don‚Äôt wear garments, they know I drink coffee but that is it.

Here‚Äôs where we get to our ethical dilemma. My family is extremely wealthy and my parents have offered help me buy a house. They will cover the down payment and also pay cash for it so that I can pay them a lower interest rate on the loan. I have enough money to cover my own down payment but interest rates are sky high right now and a lower interest rate would be invaluable.


The only catch is that my parents have made it clear that only active temple recommend holders can reap the benefits of the trust fund. My temple recommend hasn‚Äôt expired yet which means if I buy a house now and deconstruct later, what could they do?

I think it‚Äôs unethical, it‚Äôs financial manipulation. But it‚Äôs hard for me to resist their offer. I also don‚Äôt feel ready to open up to them about my decision to leave the church regardless of the financial stakes. What should I do?",3,1741902681.0,exmormon,5,1.0,False

\-Is it worth it to live in Altstadt for a more social life? I will be moving by myself, not knowing anyone in the city yet... Considering money is not a (big) problem, is it a big benefit to live there to be able to participate more in the city life? Like joining sports activities, night outs, coffees, concerts... Or since I will be working in Neuss, does it make more sense to live there and just come to DD 2x,3x a week?

\- How hard is it to find an apartment? I am reading in posts here that it's hard, but on sites such as immobilienscout24 there are a lot of options... Are these ghost posts, so, not really available?

1janmrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1janmrq/feel_bad_about_raising_rent/,Feel Bad about Raising Rent,"I (33f) am a landlord. I own a double. I live upstairs and my tenants lived downstairs before me. They're a couple in their early 60s. Both of them haven't worked in decades and get disability and social security. They have all the public benefits (food stamps, heat assistance, etc). When I bought the house 6 years ago, I told them they could stay and I wouldn't raise the rent. They have lived there now for about 15 years. When I moved in, my tenants were paying $550 a month in 2018. The cost was lower because they mow the lawn and shovel the driveway in the winter. They do not have off street parking. I added all new carpets and central air conditioning. I let them paint and do whatever they want. I pay water and they pay their other utilities.

For context, the people across the street from me currently pay $1050 a month and the person next door said they pay $900. The rent in my street varies. It's in Buffalo, NY. It's not exactly in the best part of the city. There is nothing crazy as far as crime but in also not going to leave anything valuable in my car. It's walking distance from a few hot spots. Also walking distance from restaurants and a grocery store.

Lately, property tax has increased along with sewer tax, my water bill is now $200 every three months (my neighbors pay the same), my utilities have increased, , just like basically everything else. I work a full-time job and I have two side hustles. I had to do repairs to the house and I feel like I can't keep up financially. Last year I raised the rent to $660 a month and I can tell they were very upset and got mad.

It's hard because they get the entire backyard. We're supposed to share the front porch. The front porch is really nice since it's right in the city. However, I cannot sit on it. They are avid cigarette smokers, which I'm completely fine with. I have no problems with that. The problem is that they're on the porch 24/7. Between the both of them, in the summer somebody is always on the porch at all hours of the day. They do go in for 20 minute breaks here and there but they're back out asap. I don't have any privacy unless I am inside. They have their side of the porch and I put on two beautiful chairs on my side. I can't even sit on them because every time I do my paperwork for work out there, they come right out there too. But I can't really say anything because they pay rent and it's their porch too. They're entitled to it. 

They're on the porch so often that anyone who picks me up, they watch me go into the car. Then they ask me who that person was. They also watch me water my plants and they comment that I'm giving the plants too much water. Sometimes my mom comes over, we want to have coffee on the porch. But when we do, my tenants come out and they won't leave us alone to have a conversation. I got really nice cushions last year but I couldn't use them because my tenants would have their family members over and have their family members sit on my vinyl chairs without permission. I had to throw the cushions out at the end of the season because they had dog hair all over them and they were squished down. I only sat on them twice and my tenants and I don't own a dog. 

It's hard because I can't sit on the porch. I don't really want the backyard. During the summer, it's spider Central back there. But the porch would be nice but it stresses me out to even leave my house because they're watching me with every move that I do.

I quit my last team so that I wouldn't have to choose work over family. My boss/team leader was that kind of a-hole. It was great to have him backing you, but the condescension, toxic environment, and power dynamic/abuse was not ideal.

Stay at home dads, how are you able to make it in this industry? We only have daycare 3 days out of the week, for 5 hours out of the day. I'm finding it difficult to keep my momentum going when there's  4 days in between work periods, and then trying to pick up back where I left off.

My girlfriend is the breadwinner in our household, but I still have my own mortgage I have to pay that has been slowly chipping away on the last bit of savings I have built up. The last few times I have been able to secure a transaction, it feels like a lot of stumbling every single time despite having been in the business for nearly a decade. I find myself making rookie mistakes, and feel green all over again. It feels like I am so out of practice, and without a team that was previously backing me, I feel even more like an imposter.

My girlfriend wants to do fun family stuff when she gets off work, and when the weekend hits. On those days we don't have childcare help, it means me ending up doing full dad duty the entire day and night. We've spoken about this, but it always slips her mind. I feel guilty when I have to turn down family time so I can take a breather, or try to work, or anything else I want to do that takes my time and attention. Then if I do anything that doesn't immediately result in money, I feel like I'm getting judged for wasting time. Working a lead doesn't always result in a payday immediately, she's had trouble understanding that.

I feel stuck. Or like a flailing mess impersonating a Realtor. Especially with the new changes that have been happening with the last couple of years. Sometimes it feels like I can never catch up

Stay at home dads who continue to be Realtors, are you able to make it? When it's just me watching our kid, and we're trying to cut down on TV, I feel like I struggle to be interested in playing when I also have to worry about how I'm gonna make money to pay my own bills, and just have to sit and watch my bank account slowly dry up while I do nothing about it.

I wanted to take a moment to share a story that‚Äôs close to my heart‚Äîone that led me on an unexpected journey into the world of real estate investing. It all started when I found myself spending countless evenings poring over spreadsheets and property listings, desperately trying to find that perfect investment. Every potential deal came with its own set of endless calculations and what-ifs. It was exciting, yet overwhelmingly tedious, and I began to wonder if there was a better way.

One day, as I sat back with a cup of coffee and a heavy dose of frustration, a thought struck me. What if I could bring all those scattered calculations together into one seamless process? What if there were a tool that could automatically crunch the numbers while I focused on discovering the next big opportunity? That‚Äôs when the idea for EstiMate was born.

I rolled up my sleeves and began tinkering with code, determined to build something that could truly change the game. Over many late nights and countless cups of coffee, I developed a browser extension that integrates directly with your favorite real estate sites like Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com. With just a single click, EstiMate pulls the essential data from any listing and provides a quick, back-of-the-envelope analysis. It wasn‚Äôt just about saving time‚Äîit was about giving back the joy and excitement of the hunt.

Now, I‚Äôm excited to invite you all to be a part of this journey. I‚Äôd love for you to try out EstiMate and let me know how it fits into your investment process. To show my appreciation for early supporters, I‚Äôm offering a special locked-in 50% discount for the next week with the coupon code Early50.

You can check out the tool at [http://esti-matecalculator.com/](http://esti-matecalculator.com/) and see if it makes your property search a little less stressful and a lot more efficient. Your feedback means the world to me, and I‚Äôm eager to hear your stories too.

Thanks for reading, and here‚Äôs to smarter, more effortless investing!

Best,

Thank you all in advance for any help with this question! I have read previous threads but some are older and I am a little confused on certain details. 

1. Is the green sand beach on the big island worth it? I will be in big island for two whole days. I would like to do the volcanoes, the Punalu'u Black sand beach, green sand beach, Kona coffee farm, and Pu ªuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park. We will fly into Hilo and fly out of Kona. 

2. I have seen some posts discuss the hike vs.  4WD drive vs. local rides. I have also say people say driving here is illegal. Is taking rides from locals still happening? If so how often? Also how expensive for local ride?

3. How often do people swim in the waters at green sand beach? I have read in prior posts the water is very turbulent. I have a friend who is interested in swimming there but don‚Äôt know how common that is

So I am a supervisor. I'm very laid back. I have banter with my employees, I surport them in and outside of work, I go above and beyond to make sure my team is supported and happy. I do treat days where I will buy everyone in the office a coffee or food delivery, i always make sure there is women products and person hygiene items in the changing room and toilets. All out of my own money, they are a good team and no gratitude feom the powers that be so i like to show my appreciation to them. Because I feel a happy team works better together. It's a large team and there's obviously times of clash. I'm a boss that treats everyone equal, have fun but everyone is also very aware that I am still the boss, and if I need to take you aside to speak about your behaviour I will, and I won't hold back and make sure things are always dealt with correctly and fairly. I am not friends with any colleagues outside of work. If they need me then 100 percent I'd pick up the phone but in general we di not speak out side of work, I am not fb friends with anyone. I am just very happy with works work and personal life is personal. 
Ok so now we've got through the setting ¬πof the environment, I am stood having a meeting with my area manager and head office. We are stood because I'm always running around, different people from different departments running to ask a question, my staff needing something or questions answered. (I'm busy and can't get a paragraph out without being interrupted) thos meeting is going on for about 45mins when a member of my team walks pasts me, clips my hair clip (I'm wearing a claw clip so she pinches it a d let's it go) the just walks past smirking like it joke! I was absolutely shocked. I just said can you see that I'm in a meeting. I was raging. 15 mins later I said to my area manager I'm going to speak about that and I want you present when I do on Monday. Honestly, I am a person who hate being touched. Like unacceptable unnessacery touching freaks me out. It makes me flinch. I'm not a hugger to anyone that isn't in circle. It's uncomfortable. So her walking past and doing that to my hair clip it's been making me boil every since. I feel like it's an invasion of personal space, it was disrespectful to do that to someone who is your superior and massively disrespectful ti do that well in a meeting with my superiors. Honestly I'm shocked and really wound up about it. This employee seems to be a little to friendly and don't understand that I am her manager but also there are people above that pay her wages. I don't know if I'm overacting because I hate being touched. Or I've never had an employee on this team be disrespectful. But I really feel so pissed off like she undermided my authority and those above.

1jan3lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOlympians/comments/1jan3lh/spring_equinox_celebrations/,Spring Equinox Celebrationsüíê,"‚ú®The Spring Equinox is Officially Starting on the 20th of This Month. As Spring Equinox is fully coming into swing, this also means that Lady Persephone will be returning back to the Earthly Realm to reunite with her mother, Lady Demeter. This is also a perfect time to celebrate and honour Lord Hades too, as Spring is the balance between Light and Darkness. 

Here are some ways I've thought of how we can honour them for the Spring Equinox;

Lady Demeter üåæ:
- Support Local Farmers & Small Businesses
- Plants Seeds (Literally and Metaphorically) 
- Start Fresh and New
- Spend time with Loved Ones
- Learn about Plants & Flowers
- Learn Seasonal Recipes
- Practice Self-Care
- Honour the Planet 

Lady Persephone üíê:
- Offer Her Flowers & Plants 
- Honour life and death
- Making Flower Crowns
- Wear Light and Dark Clothing
- Honour the Moon Phases
- Honour the dead and ancestors
- Tend to the Garden
- Honour the Nympths
- Play music that reminds you of her and Hades
- Talk about her Husband

Lord Hades üíÄ:
- Respect and Honour The Dead
- Offer him Flowers (He likes them as it reminds him of Persephone) 
- Wear Darker Colours
- Offer him Coins 
- Support Local Animal Shelters (Especially Dogs) 
- Honour Charon and Thanatos
- Learn about Spirits and the Underworld 
- Offer him rich indulgent food (Chocolate, Coffee, Pomengranates etc) 
- Talk about His Love Story
- Spend Time with Pets and be Kind to Animals
- Save and Spend Money Wisely

I'll be posting much more leading up to the Spring Equinox, is there anyone else you'd like to see honoured and how can we do so? Please share!

Setting: Your mansion, Diego's wing. It's morning and you just woke up.

[Yawns] [In sleepy voice] God, my head hurts. I shouldn't have drank all night. 

[Groans] I need some coffee.

[Confused] Where did the cook go?

(Pause)

[Cautious] What's that voice? 

[Footsteps start]

It's coming from Diego's office.

[Footsteps stop]

[Shocked] Lili? What are you doing here? Get away from that door!

(Pause)

[Softly] Baby, you never ever open that door, okay? Remember what your daddy said the other day? There are monsters on the other end of that door. If you open it, they'll take you away from us. You don't want that now, do you?

(Pause)

You're not scared of them? Of course you're not [chuckles]. 

You can fight them when you're older but right now, let's go back to the living room. Come on...

(Pause)

Oh, it's you. I guess she ran off from your room again. Don't let her come inside this room. You know how dangerous it is.

(Pause)

I didn't mean that. I know that you know about the dungeon.

(Pause)

I know you're her mother and you know how to take care of her. I just... Forget it. Is Diego up?

(Pause)

Still? But it's almost 10 am. He hardly ever sleeps in.

(Pause)

Tired? From what- 

You know what, don't answer that. I think I already know. 

(Pause)

Can you make me some coffee? My head feels like it will explode any minute now.

(Pause)

Yeah, I was out with Matteo and Luca after work. We just... hit the club and then we hung out at Matteo's old garage.

(Pause)

[Bored] Don't worry, I didn't do any drugs. I've been clean for more than 3 years now. I would never risk being an addict again.

(Pause)

Well, that depends on what the question is. What do you wanna know? 

(Pause)

That's none of your business. Whoever is in that dungeon is not your concern.

(Pause)

[Sighs] Fine! We have kept a girl in our captivity. It's work, and I don't want you interfering in it. 

(Pause)

No, I am not going to kill her. I need her to be alive until her father pays off his debts.

(Pause)

No fucking way. I'm not telling you any more of this. Just keep living like you were and forget about the girl.

(Pause)

[Shocked and furious] You what?! You want to bring her food? Have you gone insane? Diego would never allow that. Forget Diego, you'll have to pass through me first. There is no way I am even letting her near you or Lili.

(Pause)

Fine, if you're so worried about her. Hand me the plate, I'll give it to her. But you are not coming down there with me. 

(Pause)

[Scoffs] You don't trust me? One happy family we are, aren't we?

(Pause)

Diego will cut me into pieces and then feed them to our dogs if I even let you near the dungeon.

(Pause)

[Panicked] That is his office! You really think he won't find out if you step into his office and try to talk to someone in HIS captivity?!

(Pause)

You are insane and negligent and stubborn. That's a deadly combination.  But you'll have to do more than that to convince me. You are not going down there. This discussion ends here. 

(Pause)

[Sarcastic] Oh good. The sweet husband is awake. Your loving wife wants to go down the dungeon and feed the girl. Remind me why you married her again- 

Ow! What the fuck, did you just smack my head? 

(Pause)

Oh, I'm acting like a brat? What about your loving wife here who wants to feed a captive with her own hands?

(Pause)

Diego, I know that look. What are you thinking about? Don't tell me you're actually considering this.

(Pause)

I know I said she isn't dangerous but if she's in the same room with her, God knows what she'll do to try to escape. This isn't a risk worth taking.

(Pause)

[Sarcastic] You know I wonder: If you are sleeping with someone that's insane, can their insanity be contagious through intimate contact? 

(Pause)

[Scoffs] ""Maybe"" ... You did not just say that. What does a guy need to do to be taken seriously around here?

(Pause)

Fine. I'm in no mood for arguments right now. But I'm going down there with her.

(Pause)

Alright. Let's get this over with. 

[Mutters] Sometimes I wonder how my life would've been if I had never left America to come back to Italy. Peaceful, probably. 

[Footsteps start]

[In denial] How you convinced Diego to let you in here, I'll never know. You're changing him and that's not a good sign.

(Pause)

It's not like I don't trust you like he does. I do. It's her that I don't trust.

[Footsteps stop]

[Commanding] Remember the rule, stay 10 feet away from her.

[Metal door creaks open sfx]

[Commanding] Just put down the plate and leave.

(Pause)

[Cautious] What are you doing? We discussed that you don't get to talk to her. Just put the damn plate down and get out of here!

(Pause)

[Hasty] Look I'm giving you 10 seconds. If I don't find you outside the cell in 10 seconds, I'm calling Diego.

[After 10 seconds]

Okay that's enough. Come here.

[Metal door shuts SFX]

All you had to do was give her the food. We never agreed on discreet conversations.

(Pause)

That girl in there, we just abducted her from her own house, in front of her father. She will try everything in her power to escape from here, even if it means hurting you. And I'd rather die than let that happen. So just for once, take me seriously and do as I say.

(Pause)

Let's go. I don't want you staying here for even a split second.

[Footsteps start]

[Footsteps stop]

[Door closes shut SFX]

[Time skips to late night. Luca visits you to discuss about business.]

How many final entries?

(Pause)

[Demanding tone] Luca, I'm talking to you. How many entries have been finalized?

(Pause)

Sounds like we're good to go. I still have to take a look at the race circuit. There are a few slow corners in our circuit, but we need more. Start looking for a different location for the fourth race. We'll do the rest of the season somewhere else. Palermo isn't working anymore.

(Pause)

Any news from the Russian mafia? Diego already has a lot on his plate. I want to minimize distractions for him.

(Pause)

You've seen some movement in their territory? What kind of movement?

(Pause)

But Diego made sure to kill them all. Who could it possibly be?

(Pause)

Get all the info you can, by tomorrow morning. I want to get this resolved by this week itself.

(Pause)

The girl? I've been too busy to check up on her today. Although I did see her in the morning. Diego's wife foolishly wanted to feed her and I didn't get a say in it so I had to take her down there. 

(Pause)

I know, I found it strange too. She's never insisted on talking to any of our captives before. Before we left, she did talk to her about something and when I asked, she refused to tell me about it.

(Pause)

[Sighs] Forget it. She'd rather burn the house down than give me a straight answer. It feels like annoying me is her hobby nowadays.

(Pause)

Did Matteo take rounds on the race track today? 

(Pause)

Dude, cat got your tongue or what? Did he come or not? 

(Pause)

So I was right. He WAS fooling around with that hooker he keeps meeting. That asshole keeps taking our friendship for granted and I'm sick of it now. Call me as soon as you see him.

[Door slams open sfx]

Woah Bruno slow down, what's wrong? 

(Pause)

[Shocked] She what? 

Did you check properly?

(Pause)

[Furious] How in this fucking world could she have escaped from there! Send the guards to look for her in the woods. Luca, check my wing. Bruno, inform Diego and check his wing too. I want her back right now.

You show up to [Redbones](https://redbones.com/) at 6:30pm on Friday. You walk down the stairs to Underbones. The group has already begun assembling around the long hightop tables. You make friends with a few of the 30ish random people from the internet. They're delightful human beings. You're hungry so you get a BBQ meat platter with a side of baked beans and mac & cheese. Or biscuits with peach jam. Or maybe cornbread. I really can't anticipate your side dish preferences. One of our five trivia teams adopts you onto their team. They proceed to disappoint you with their unbelievable lack of 1990s sports knowledge.

You rapidly order a slice of pecan pie because it's Pi Day. Also, there is no doubt that pecan pie would pair wonderfully with the bold coffee notes of the imperial stout. You impress your team with your knowledge of 1980s classic rock anthems. There is banter. There is laughter. There is genuine human connection. You can't remember anyone's name, but they also keep forgetting yours so it's all fine. In a last-ditch attempt to secure first place, your team wagers everything based on your combined expert knowledge of etymology. You misheard the topic. The question is actually about bugs.

1jamx3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1jamx3o/the_path_to_the_dungeon_a_bit_of_dcc_fiction/,The Path to the Dungeon (A bit of DCC Fiction),"**I present an early bit of DCC fiction written by myself for fun. It's pretty rough. It details a young man and his autistic brother's experience. I haven't really plotted out much past Level 3, and I'm not even sure it's worth reading, but I thought someone might enjoy it and I'm sure I'll get some degree of feedback, good or otherwise as guidance! I've always wanted to write and this has been a joyful way to dip my toe into the water - writing is easy, planning a story (for me at least) is nearly impossible, and I have no editor or proofreader, so please forgive the mistakes I'm sure are littered throughout!** 

**I've marked this as fan 'art' in so much as a fan's fiction can be. In any case, here's The Path to the Dungeon. Thanks!**

Chip watched as the world he knew collapsed around him and ceased to exist. His home, his car, his dog, and what remained of his family. The sound caused him to jump so high he had barely been able to stand. Chip‚Äôs brother, Sims, had his hands over his ears, his entire body clenched up. Sims had just opened the car door, and now was standing next to a vaguely car-shaped dirt square cut directly into the driveway pavement. All that was left were trees ‚Äì hundreds and hundreds of trees and big, open lots.

As Chip looked around the neighborhood, every single house was gone. The cars were gone. It looked like a new development were new homes were going to be.

Sims was autistic ‚Äì he was a slim kid with a slightly funny walk and a funny way of speaking that could be on occasion difficult for others to understand. Not always, but if it was complex or the words were big enough, some folks might struggle. He had stayed at Chip‚Äôs house so he could get to work early. Sims liked staying at Chips ‚Äì he had a great computer, and he spent hours scrolling through YouTube videos and watching trains, airports, and old World War II documentaries on history using the stereo speakers. Chip and Sims‚Äô parents had sent them to a private school ‚Äì Chip had done okay, but Sims struggled ‚Äì though in the end he did come away with a surprising vocabulary from his English classes. Chip had moved back into the neighborhood to be near his family and to lend a hand with Sims.

‚ÄúWHAT?‚Äù Sims asked? ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the house?‚Äù

Chip was turning around and around, looking in vain for any home that may have survived. Any neighbor. Sims had a job at a coffee shop ‚Äì and Chip had offered to take him in early ‚Äì his back hurt sometimes at night, so he didn‚Äôt mind getting up early to take Chip into the shop, especially since Chip was squeezed for cash, and sometimes the small coffee shop, Bentley‚Äôs, gave him one free. Sims was given a shift drink every day he worked, but since he didn‚Äôt like coffee, he never took it and would occasionally have them give it to Chip.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the house? Where is everything?‚Äù It came out *everyfing*. Sims sounded a little more shocked this time ‚Äì it was always hard to tell how he would react ‚Äì occasionally it was with eerie calm, and sometimes it was with utter frustration and dismay.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!‚Äù

Chip was suddenly aware of the pitch dark. He pulled out his cellphone to switch on the flashlight app. *His cellphone*! He immediately fumbled with the phone, nearly dropping it. He called his parents, who lived just down the street. His mother had helped get Sims weather and was probably awake. His father was probably still asleep. He dialed the number, but the call didn‚Äôt go through. No dial tone, no nothing. It said no signal. He thought of trying the coffee shop on the other side of town. Nothing. As Chip collected himself, he looked at the phone and saw he had no signal. He *did* have a few unread text messages. He checked them, but none of them were new ‚Äì a reminder to pick up a prescription, a leftover code he‚Äôd needed to authenticate a bank sign in, and a message from his girlfriend Erica saying she was excited to see him with a little smiling face emoji.

Erica. Chip had seen the text come in at 9:30, but it was late and he decided he‚Äôd reply in the morning. Chip felt a sudden pang of guilt and shock. Desperately, he grabbed at the phone and attempted to call her, knowing the call would fail like the others. Nothing. He wondered if this had happened there too or if it was just here and there was no signal.

What even HAD happened? ¬†Chip looked around for Sims, who was leaning over the dirty outline of the house as if it were the precipice of a great cliff.

Chip suddenly felt a deep, sinking fear. As he did, he began to hear a voice deep in his head ‚ÄúSurviving Humans ‚Äì take note.‚Äù The feeling was similar to when a deep bass played and rattled your teeth, but this seemed to rattle his brain.

As the voice spoke, Chip felt like he was in the beginning of ‚ÄòThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.‚Äô He had always loved that book, and had often thought of how exciting an adventure across space would be. At the moment, with a thick, sickening knot pulling at his core, he was not excited. If he‚Äôd had breakfast, he‚Äôd have heaved it up onto the driveway.

The voice continued and text appeared. As Chip looked over at Sims, he seemed to be seeing the same thing. He was swiping in front of him, reaching for text that Chip could see but not touch. Chip had played a lot of video games, and this felt a lot like a first-person shooter heads up display. ‚Äò*Maybe I‚Äôm dreaming*‚Äô he thought. ‚Äò*This must be a dream about a video game*.‚Äô A misplaced step over the single stair to his patio sent him suddenly to the pavement. The searing pain as he scraped his hand snapped him out of his trance and provided much unwanted evidence that he was amongst the few drawing air.

The voice ended and the night became very still. Chip strained to hear anything ‚Äì but was greeted only by an owl so far in the distance he couldn‚Äôt trust that he even heard it for sure, or maybe the horn from a big rig? Chip didn‚Äôt think about it; he just stopped to try and process what he‚Äôd just been presented.

‚ÄúIs this a video game?‚Äù came a question from Sims. ‚ÄúI see a screen in front of me.‚Äù As he fumbled with the words, Chip realized that his mother- Sims‚Äô mother- was probably gone, along with his father and at least one of his sisters -the other was in Tennessee. Maybe she was far enough away to avoid it ‚Äì but the insane, impossible talking voice had said the whole planet. As Chip processed the thing he didn‚Äôt want to believe but knew to be true, he stopped himself.

The *Borant* corporation. *Aliens*. A whole new discomfort swelled up inside of him. He looked up to the sky, expecting to see a UFO approaching him from over the trees, but nothing appeared. Just as he began to look away, a beam of light shot up into the sky.

‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs something‚Äù Sims said matter-of-factly. Chip wheeled around and another beam of light reached up into the night past the trees.

‚Äú*People*‚Äù Chris said to himself. For a second, he thought maybe this could be the aliens. ALIENS! This was not what he‚Äôd expected. This wasn‚Äôt like a single episode of *Star Trek* or *Star Wars* or anything else he‚Äôd ever imagined, and he didn‚Äôt even know what they looked like. He thought of all the science fiction he‚Äôd seen over the years and imagined giant, sentient spiders or ooze like creatures the consistency of yogurt ‚Äì but he knew that whatever they were, it was probably something no one anywhere had ever imagined and was as anatomically different as the creatures from the *Aliens* films. But why did this sound SO much like a typical video game? He‚Äôd opened thousands of loot boxes. That seemed so comfortable it was somehow *more* unsettling.

Content in the knowledge that whatever they were, if, again, this insanity was real, he could not possibly imagine them, he looked at the lights. One was near the local military base. The other was probably down town by the hospital. The one near the base looked closer ‚Äì and they might have guns ‚Äì but he didn‚Äôt really know much about where anything was on the base ‚Äì and it failed to occur to him that whatever was there was now an open plain. Chris knew where the hospital was He‚Äôd been to St. Johns dozens of times ‚Äì for doctors appointments, to visit his gastro doctor for the ulcers, and once, when he‚Äôd been particularly broke, to get out of the rain and have a free cup of coffee in the lobby ‚Äì which had beautiful marble floors and comfy armchairs. Maybe it was still there. Maybe the light was coming from there!

That reminded Chip that he needed his blood pressure meds ‚Äì and his CPAP. He turned around to grab them, and then was reminded with a second, unexpected shock that all of that was gone too, along with his computer, his collection of movies, the brownies his sister had just baked, and his nose hair trimmer ‚Äì everything that came into his mind.

Sims was still wandering around. Now that the sounds had ended, he seemed more or less nonplused by everything that happened. ‚ÄòMaybe Chip thought, ‚Äòthe world is finally peaceful for him.‚Äô

‚ÄúSims‚Äù Chip called out ‚Äì you think there might be people at the spotlight?

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he said ‚Äì sounding much more like a question than a certainty.

Chip reached for his car keys, staring at the bright beam of light, pulled them out, and turned to a car that wasn‚Äôt there. He brought the keys up to his face, holding them against the moonlight, and tucked them into his jacket pocket and hiked up his jeans. He threw his hands in air, exasperated.

‚ÄúDo you have good shoes on?‚Äù Chip looked down and was happy to see Sims had picked comfortable shoes for work. He always wore comfortable shoes ‚Äì that wasn‚Äôt a surprise, but it was nice that one thing he expected to happen actually had.

Sims shuffled a bit. ‚ÄúYes, I do have the comfy shoes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Do we walk towards the Fort or do we walk towards town? There might be military near the fort, but we don‚Äôt know it ‚Äì the other one is towards town. Maybe it‚Äôs the hospital ‚Äì or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, I have to go to work.‚Äù

Chip sighed. ‚ÄúI think work is off today, buddy. The light might be the best way to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs go to the town.‚Äù As Chip had expected, the town was a more comfortable choice for Sims ‚Äì and the beam was on the way to the coffee shop and Chip‚Äôs office. It would also take them past their parents house. He didn‚Äôt know how he‚Äôd feel passing that place.

Chip walked up to his patio ‚Äì the only thing still standing ‚Äì even his flagpole seemed to have been swallowed, smashed, or whatever the hell happened to everything. He grabbed an old pinecone and scratched out ‚Äògone to spotlight in town ‚Äì taking Spring Lake. Find me if you can.‚Äô He plucked his house key off his key ring ‚Äì it had a small crescent moon on it and placed it on the patio by the mat.

With that, he tightened his jacket ‚Äì it was quite brisk in the dark - and started down the street. Sims shuffled along behind him, his lilting, odd walk placing him a few places behind.

With no street lights, dozens of tall trees blocking the waning moon, and the large, open home areas, their formerly cozy neighborhood ‚Äì where they knew everyone for two blocks, seemed eerie. A sound came from the trees on the left.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Sims asked, stiff in the shoulders. For a moment, Chip imagined something lurking in the distance, but that was Ms. Florence‚Äôs yard ‚Äì which was full of walnut trees. He was sure a walnut had just separated from a branch and was making the long trek down the trunk, sparing a ‚Äòthunk‚Äô on every damn limb on the way down. Chip was sure that‚Äôs what it was. He was *mostly* sure. The whole world was surreal and felt like a dream.

As Chip and Sims wound their way down the hill and around the corner, they passed the intersection, where one of the Andrews brothers lived. The whole Andrews family lived within two streets ‚Äì including Briggs and his brother Todd, who lived right next to their parents.

As they made their way along Lakeview, they were able to see much more. The missing homes gave way to trees that left a view of the lake. There was nothing around it but trees. Chip knew if he looked ahead, he would be able to see the spot where his parents house used to be.

He did not look ahead. He kept staring across the lake, glancing at the sky for some sign of airplanes or UFO‚Äôs or something, and then back at his feet.

As they passed a three-way crossing, Chip noticed even the fire hydrant was gone. That patch of grass in between the streets didn‚Äôt really belong to any home, ‚Äòunincorporated lands‚Äô he‚Äôd called them, so he‚Äôd encouraged his dog Patty to pee there when he was younger since there was no chance of incensing the elderly ‚Äòget off my grass‚Äô crowd. Now the tilted old thing was just *not there*.

As they moved along, Chip finally looked up to the spot where he grew up. His childhood home ‚Äì and his parents ‚Äì were just gone. There was nothing there. He walked across the lawn and saw the tire he used to use as a swing rotting in amongst weeds dead leaves. He walked over and his toe banged into something ‚Äì a piece of rebar with a bent end from some project his father had started or another ‚Äì his dad Jack had always wanted to start a garden ‚Äì and had several times. He‚Äôd just never *finished* one. Chip hefted the rebar and poked it into the ground. It felt like a walking stick, just heavier and a bit rusty. He‚Äôs was careful to keep his skinned hand clear. He found he appreciated having something to hold on to. His mind tried to find something to lock on to, some piece of hope or grief, but he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äì all he could think about was how stupidly, feverishly impossible this all seemed.

As they passed out of the neighborhood and into town, stepping over a crushed, smashed area across the street that he didn‚Äôt recognize, he looked towards the town and saw the beam in the sky. It wasn‚Äôt even close to the hospital ‚Äì he‚Äôd misjudged the distance by almost half a mile ‚Äì it was in what used to be a shopping plaza ‚Äì the organic grocery store, the men‚Äôs tailor, the deli shop and ice cream parlor he‚Äôd labored over during high school ‚Äì they were just dirty square spaces now. In the back corner, near where the post office was they saw the beam. As they walked over, the sound of the rebar cane against the concrete seemed to echo off into the trees and bounce back.

As Chip looked behind himself, he saw Sims about 15 yards back. He was incredibly calm ‚Äì he looked a bit tense in the shoulders, but the weight of it all didn‚Äôt seem to register to him. If it did, he was able to hold that emotion entirely inside. If just didn‚Äôt register ‚Äì well, Chip envied his brother either way. He waited a moment for Sims to catch up.

‚ÄúDo you think Mom and Dad are OK? Or Erica?‚Äù Chip asked. He hoped it would pull some idea of Sims‚Äô mental state out of him.

Sims looked away, avoiding eye contact as he often did with strangers. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not talk about that.‚Äù That was his go-to phrase when something was too emotionally difficult for him to confront.

From the clearing, Chip could now see several more beams of light reaching into the sky. He walked closer to the one in the plaza ‚Äì in the distance, he saw someone approaching from the other side.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù He called into the openness.

Whoever it was looked over, and ran, thudding shoes echoing into the distance. The unnerving sound caused Chip to slow. He walked cautiously towards the light. Quietly, he again looked at Sims. ‚ÄúShould we take a look?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù The reply was short ‚Äì and Chip couldn‚Äôt read fear, excitement, or any other true emotion from the statement ‚Äì if anything, it sounded like Sims‚Äô mind was elsewhere.

They both approached slowly, trying not to make a sound. Chip wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect down the hole ‚Äì a space ship, a pit filled with slimy creatures scrambling to get out, the eyes of a monstrous creature, ready to pull down and eat someone. What he did *not* expect as he peeked over the edge was a staircase ‚Äì a very nice metal staircase descending into the ground.

‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* is this?‚Äù he asked no one.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stairs you ding-a-ling‚Äù his brother responded unexpectedly. They were extremely wide ‚Äì and there was a general warmth coming from them ‚Äì a nice change from the low fifties it seemed to be here. Chip lifted his phone again ‚Äì anxious to share this unbelievable experience with someone ‚Äì anyone, but there was still zero signal.

For a while, Chip walked around the opening, trying to decide what to do. It felt like a nice campfire in a field, except the field was a everything he‚Äôd ever known. Meanwhile, Sims was kicking rocks into the hole and shuffling around, focused on the whole world and nothing at all.

Chip sighed. ‚ÄúI think we have to go down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to think about that‚Äù Sims responded ‚Äì his general go to when he did *not* want to do something.

‚ÄúI think we have to. We don‚Äôt have anywhere to go.‚Äù Home is gone. The car is gone. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs down there. Maybe it‚Äôs a safety shelter, maybe it‚Äôs something else, but we can‚Äôt stay here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not talk about home and the stairs.‚Äù

Chip knew this was going to go sideways. He tried for a moment to rationalize with his brother, but he was difficult to reason with, and there was nothing rational or reasonable about any of this.

‚ÄúHow about I wait here. There ya go.‚Äù

Chip was becoming a bit worried. ‚ÄúWe have to go. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù He found himself nearer to tears than he‚Äôd ever been, and fought desperately to keep them back. His throat tightened. He tried to walk his brother over, but he pulled away.

‚ÄúHey, hey, I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm good!‚Äù Sims tried to squirrel away and backed several feet away.

Chip decided to provide some proof. He walked over and tapped a stair with his foot. It seemed stable and didn‚Äôt give. He took a step on and started to bounce a little, then a little harder. He jumped up a couple of times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strong!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù¬† Chip hopped back over to his brother and started pushing him down the stairs. ‚ÄúNo wait! STOP! STOOOP!‚Äù Sims started to yell.

Off in the dark, a shadow moved. ‚ÄúHEY! HEY YOU!‚Äù A male voice called. It occurred to Chip that it probably looked like he was in some kind of struggle with his brother. The person started to run towards them, screaming. ‚ÄúHEY! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE? STOP!‚Äù

It turned out the guy wasn‚Äôt just running, he was hauling. It was enough to startle both of them into action.

‚ÄúGO! GO GO GO!‚Äù Chip let go of Sims and started bounding down the stairs, and to his credit, Sims followed, working his way quickly ‚Äì but carefully down the stairs in his own unique way.",2,1741900359.0,DungeonCrawlerCarl,0,0.75,False

1jamsfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1jamsfo/struggling_to_adjust_as_a_new_attending/,Struggling to Adjust as a New Attending,"Hey all. I am in my eighth month at a community shop after completing residency.  For context, I trained at a respected residency program in a tertiary care setting.  I had no concerns in residency and generally enjoyed the job in residency.  

I have been majorly struggling basically ever since I started working as an attending.  My current hospital is a non-academic high acuity, high volume ED that is actually fairly well resourced with many subspecialties.

In the ED I work in, metrics are highly prioritized.  All patients are seen by a provider very shortly after arrival, either in the hallway on the EMS stretcher (if they arrived by ambulance), or sitting up in a chair (fully clothed in a non private space) in triage.  My shifts are 12 hours and there is virtually no sign out culture.  The general idea is that you hustle and try to see all of your patients within the first half of your shift, clean up in the second half of your shift, and then leave without any sign outs.   This sounds great in theory, but almost never works out for me.  It is not uncommon for me to leave anywhere from 1-4 hours late.  I often find myself seeing \~25 patients in the first few hours of my shift, which feels so unsafe every time I do it.  During my last shift I worked, I saw 30 patients in the first 3.5 hours I was there.  This is even more challenging if there are any critical patients or if patients need procedures.  In addition to feeling overwhelmed by those numbers, I also struggle with feeling like I have no control over my work flow on shift.  Any time a patient is in triage, I am expected to drop everything else I am doing to see them.  Same goes for EMS stretchers - staff is adamant that patients be seen while on the stretchers before they go out to the waiting room.  I understand the logic of this to an extent to try and prevent people sitting in the waiting room for hours without an evaluation or any orders, but the problem is there is no cap to the amount that I am expected to see within a certain time frame.  Additionally, we also have scribes who (in addition to writing our HPIs) are instructed during their training to watch the ER trackboard and assign us to patients as soon as they appear on the board (without my permission or knowledge most of the time).

Other docs seem to work here with ease, which is what I can't figure out. In fact, many of them leave their shifts early.  Meanwhile, I have major anxiety before all of my shifts, struggle to get any documentation done on shift, struggle to make decisions about patient disposition, leave late, and often spend hours after my shifts dwelling on every decision I made and fretting that I may have made a mistake.  This is a stark contrast to what I experienced during residency.  I feel what I'm doing currently is not safe or sustainable.   I can't tell if this is normal new attending woes vs if some of this may be related to my work environment and the specifics of my job.  Most days I question my own abilities and decision to pursue this career and wonder if I should get out now and become a coffee shop barista.    
  
Has anyone had similar experiences? For those of you with other jobs or more experience, does the above work environment seem out of the usual? Right now I need some hope that things will get better and won't always feel so impossible.  ",2,1741900036.0,emergencymedicine,4,0.75,False

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
### Rich Source of Protein

One of the main advantages of high-protein ice cream is its protein content. Traditional ice creams are typically low in protein and high in sugar. In contrast, high-protein ice cream can contain anywhere from 20 to 30 grams of protein per serving. This increase helps you meet your daily protein needs, especially for those engaged in regular exercise or strength training.

### Supports Muscle Recovery

After a workout, your body craves protein to repair and build muscle. Consuming high-protein ice cream alternatives can be an effective way to support recovery post-exercise. The protein aids in muscle repair, which can lead to better performance in your next workout. This makes it an appealing option for post-gym treats.

### Lower in Sugar

- High-protein ice cream alternatives are often formulated with lower amounts of sugar compared to traditional varieties.
- Many brands use natural sweeteners, such as stevia or erythritol, to enhance flavor without adding excess sugar.
- It helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, reducing spikes and crashes.

This lower sugar content means you can indulge in dessert without the guilt, making it an excellent choice for those tracking their sugar intake.

### Supports Weight Management

If you're trying to maintain or lose weight, high-protein ice cream can be beneficial. Foods high in protein can help you feel fuller for longer, which may reduce overall calorie intake. Additionally, the lower sugar content helps in avoiding empty calories. This combination supports your weight management goals without requiring you to sacrifice the enjoyment of a sweet treat.

Also i feel like my appetite suppressing is the best its been now i barely ever feel hungry and cant eat big meals anymore.

Lately ive been trying to implement fasting since i kinda hit a wall in my weight loss, i think before i took my cheat day i was eating too many calories. Right now my typical fast starts around 9-10 pm and ive been able to make it las til 2 or even 6 pm some days with just water and a protien shake using ghost protien. Usually mixed with my coffee, or just water/milk.

I try not to weigh myself every week as it gets demotivating not noticing a change, so imostly weigh around once or twice a month. My question is am i really ""fasting"" if im having these protien shakes or is it still kinda meal.

Having just had that discussion about coffee buying etiquette triggered an underlining corporate peeve of mine. Being the bearer of a company credit card.

Because my role involves travelling I am supplied with a card but it's funny as those that have never had one don't get all the administration and policy policing it involves.

Whenever I go to the mother ship for meetings etc I am asked to go get any supplies and put it on my card. Simple you say? No. I have to enter on my claim report done through the shittiest app ever third party provided, every person's name if I put down it's a meeting and justify my purchase. It's so time consuming.

My Team that I'm a part of, we get allocated X amount at Christmas time, hey Duck, you've got the card, put the whole thing on that, save us claiming for a petty cash refund into our accounts. I can't be a Grinch can I?

And finally, coffee. Out to meet clients with my up line or with colleagues, hey Duck, put it on your card.

I am more than happy to do it, it's just all the admin and justification that it involves and monthly discussion re my credit card spend.

How do I push back without looking a prick?

I'm Ryan McDonnell, the Co-Founder and CEO of [alldae superfruit soda](http://www.drinkalldae.com), a lightly-caffeinted afternoon pick-me-up made with real tropical fruit juice and upcycled coffee fruit. Unlike others in the better-for-you soda movement, we not only have zero added sugar, but also **no Stevia**. Instead, all of the sweetness of alldae comes from real fruit juice, making our innovative flavors like Passionfruit Guava taste like real fruit by comparison to our more artificial competitors. Our products are made with cascara, a high antioxidant superfruit that is a byproduct of producing coffee, but largely goes unused until now.

I launched this in late 2023 out of the back of my car with very little upfront cash and quickly got into hundreds of stores by bootstrapping as much as we could. Now, we have larger grocery buyers looking at us and are gearing up for a proper expansion. We've sold well over a hundred thousand units since launching, and have gotten in with some lucky institutional accounts that are huge volume movers.

We have institutional investors looking to place a strategic investment in us in roughly Q3 this year and are looking to have a stronger runway to crush through our goals aggressively. Up to now we've had a shoestring budget and have been very conservative with our cash, primarily spending on producing more product and logistics. We want to continue that thoughtful spending habit as we raise more funds to fuel our growth, while being aggressive enough to grow even more quickly. We're raising $300k in total for this round.

‚ÄúI bought myself a 1zpresso K-Ultra for Christmas and I was so excited thinking a grinder upgrade would make a noticeable improvement in my coffee but I don‚Äôt feel like it has.

The recipe has been the same 3x coffee amount as bloom for 1 minute then pour the rest of the water. I‚Äôm using a 1:16 ratio, 203F/95C water for light roast brew time around ~2:45 with a flat bottom brewer from Loveramics and Kalita 185 filters. 

When I got my K-Ultra  I adjusted it to be about the same grind size I was using on the C2. I grind pretty coarse. I saw some stuff on this sub about grinding coarser and I decided to try it and was blown away at how sweet and delicious the coffee was. I was at 21 clicks on the C2 which is about 8.2 on the K-Ultra.

Needless to say the coffee wasn‚Äôt coming out good. I‚Äôm confused to why. I figured better grind with other variables the same would equal better coffee but it doesn‚Äôt. 

I am now using around a 7 grind size on the K-Ultra and the coffee is good but nowhere near as sweet. Grinding coarser produces cups that lack flavor and grinding finer seems a bit over extracted.

Any insight to why this might be happening and how I can fix it?‚Äù

Since then I‚Äôve switched to a two pour recipe and grinding around a 7.1/7.2 and my coffee is much better but I‚Äôm still not wowed like I thought I‚Äôd be.

We have a 1-year-old child and are looking for insights from locals or expats already living in H√† ƒê√¥ng.

We‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on the following:

* How is ParkCity Hanoi as a place to live? Is it a friendly, welcoming community?
* Are there many other expats or international families in the area, or is it mostly local?
* How does H√† ƒê√¥ng compare to other districts like T√¢y H·ªì, C·∫ßu Gi·∫•y, or Ho√†n Ki·∫øm in terms of lifestyle?
* Does the area feel safe and family-friendly, especially for young kids?
* Are there any annoyances or downsides about living here that people don‚Äôt talk about?

# Restaurants, Shopping & Daily Life:

* What are the best restaurants, street food stalls, or cafes in H√† ƒê√¥ng? Any must-try places?
* Are there any good local markets or wet markets nearby for fresh produce?
* What‚Äôs the coffee culture like in H√† ƒê√¥ng? Any great spots to work from or relax?

# Transport, Traffic & Connectivity

* How easy is it to get into central Hanoi (Ho√†n Ki·∫øm, T√¢y H·ªì, Ba ƒê√¨nh, etc.) from ParkCity?
* Is the C√°t Linh ‚Äì H√† ƒê√¥ng metro line useful, or do people still prefer driving/riding?
* How reliable is Grab or Be in this area? Do drivers come quickly?
* Is traffic bad during rush hour, or is H√† ƒê√¥ng more manageable than central Hanoi?
* If I need to get to Noi Bai Airport, what‚Äôs the best transport option?

# Bars, Social Life & Nightlife

* What‚Äôs the social scene like in H√† ƒê√¥ng? Are there any expat meetups or social groups?
* Are there any decent bars or pubs in H√† ƒê√¥ng?
* Where do people usually go for live music, weekend outings, or social events?
* Any good spots for Vietnamese craft beer or is that mostly found in other districts?

# Other Practical Considerations

* How bad is flooding in H√† ƒê√¥ng during the rainy season? Is it a problem in ParkCity?
* Is internet and mobile coverage good in this area? Any recommended providers?
* Are there any hidden costs or maintenance fees for living in ParkCity Hanoi?
* What‚Äôs the air quality like compared to central Hanoi?
* Would you recommend living in ParkCity Hanoi for an expat family with a 1-year-old?

We‚Äôre really keen to hear from anyone currently living in or familiar with H√† ƒê√¥ng! Any insights‚Äîwhether positive or negative‚Äîwould be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1741898807.0,hanoi,0,1.0,False
1jamar9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1jamar9/bus_boarded_by_border_patrol/,Bus boarded by Border Patrol,"Some of you will absolutely love that!

I hate it!!

Lest we forget ....

...

Two days ago I was in the laundromat. It may be my favorite public place to do laundry ever. It's in Odessa, TX (fun wash near the SA) and they have popcorn and coffee.

I see two kids walk past me. Definitely not old enough to be be in school, but walking pretty good. What's that three or four years old. Probably closer to three.

They are holding hands.

Latin. In Odessa there are a lot of Mexicans, some Puerto Rican and Cubans too.

I ask the lady next to me if they're her grandkids. She ascents.

""How cute!""

If those were white kids, I wouldn't have commented. I did that because of the political climate we live in.

....

That same day. Twenty minutes before I went to the laundromat a guy sees me.

""Redneck.""

Hmmm.

I really doubt that was directed at me, but he wasn't in a conversation that I could tell.

I just know that too many people who are my age with a similar complexion blame Mexicans, specifically, for their hardship in life.

I know because I look enough like them they think it's a safe space.

....

One of my first times in the bus in Odessa. This old white lady is holding court. Basically saying Trump is the second coming of Christ for doing ""God's work"" and getting these Mexicans out of here.

She's old. She's in a wheel chair. I'm getting annoyed AF.

""Y'all say that now. Just wait until you can't get strawberries or someone to put on your roof after a hail storm.""

Everyone laughed. Not her. She glared at me. 

....

Back to today. Peco (not sure on the spelling), TX. Stripes convenience store. Greyhound bus.

The border patrol board the bus.

They tell us all to get our passports, identification or whatever. I'm actually standing up and not in the aisle yet. I paused because I was confused.

Texas has some weird laws. They will prob hold up in court. That's the climate we're in. The Supremes have old white guy attitudes. In TX you can profile. Look foreign. Let me see some ID.

(I had already settled in my mind. I will eat shit until I get to CA. Cut in line? No problem. Driver with an attitude? No problem. Mixup on the seats? No problem. Playing your movie where I can here it? Eat shit John. You have to get to CA).

I step into the aisle. One border patrol agent is coming up the steps (I'm in seat 4A) and one is on the bus. I settled in my mind that I would show ID. Try not to have an attitude. Just do it. But you're going to have to specifically identify me.

Point at me. Get in front of me.

I walk with intention when I'm making a path.

That's what I did.

That border agent moved out of my way.

Black guy? American accent and they wanted his ID. I don't know how that went. I was off the bus. Getting my breakfast burritos.

I'm outside eating and they have a dog alerting on an Army style duffle bag. No arrests made. It was a big show.

I get back on the bus and hear a young Asian dude. He says he gets confused with being Latino all the time in Odessa since he grew his mustache out. Not much of a mustache, but I can see the confusion.

They asked for his passport.

He offered his social security number.

He didn't have to give it folks. He knew that. He's on his way to El Paso for a trucking job.

They didn't even take it or look at his driver's license which I no he had on him. Truckers on their way to the terminal have their CDL on them.

I think the kid was fucking with them.

Good for him.

....

This isn't even about my rights not to be harassed my the police. Yes. I'm that guy that will sometimes refuse an officers suggestion depending on how he approaches me.

Today. I wasn't going to be that guy.

I wasn't.

I just walked past them like you walk past the guy checking receipts at WalMart 

Dude. I have someplace to be.

So yeah. I would have had to eat shit and shut the fuck up.

...

One last thing.

Think about your children. Young. Innocent. Holding hands.

We're all the same folks.

But here's where we are different.

....

Let's say I woke up from that nap. Let's say the Queen of America had dispatched me on a Greyhound bus to California. I wake from a drunken stupor in Peco, TX. 

I start referring to them as Californians.

The Queen gets a lot of cool shit from Peco Texans, but we act like we discovered the place they were already.

It gets better folks.

The Queen that dispatched me. All her King and Queen friends made up a social construct better than gender.

We call it the law.

Because one thing the Queen knows. The Kings too.

If we can get you to subscribe to a law, we got ya!

We can actually steal your land.

...

Okay folks.

I said my peace. 

As best as I could. You'll have to fill in the blanks to fit your narrative. I can't wait for the dummies in the comments to show up. You actually can't defend deporting people from a land your ancestors stole.

No law protects your right to what was stolen. None. Ever. Even the Queen knows that!",24,1741898796.0,vagabond,5,0.88,False
1jamak7,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1jamak7/is_reducing_distractions_a_surfacelevel_fix/,Is reducing distractions a surface-level fix?,"Have you ever noticed how screen time is lowest when you‚Äôre on an exciting trip? Your day is packed with so many exciting things, that you don‚Äôt even think about distracting yourself by scrolling social media.

Ideally, that‚Äôs my goal. Optimize for increasing connection, so that I am less likely to be captured by distraction.

Whilst a lot in this community of Digital Minimalism seems to be the philosophy of ‚ÄúIncrease connection by decreasing distraction‚Äù. It makes sense. It was also my approach at the start ‚ÄúIf I focus on reducing social media use and screen time, then the connection will follow. ‚Äú

In some way this was true, but often I found myself filling that time with other distractions. I deleted social media and found other apps to distract myself with.

That‚Äôs why I started fixing the root of the problem. My focus away from ‚Äúreducing distraction‚Äù, and focus on ‚Äúincreasing connection‚Äù.

I changed from: ‚ÄúHow can I reduce distraction and screen time?‚Äù, to ‚ÄúHow can I increase connection in my life?‚Äù

A way more exciting challenge to solve. And that‚Äôs what I started doing, focusing on increasing connection. Planning a day trip with friends. Committing to start a fun side project. Going to a coffee shop to sit down and write.

All things that increase connection and significantly improve the quality of life. The screentime going down is just a product of that.

Curious to hear what works for you. Focus on reducing distraction, or increasing connection? For me it's definitely the latter.",4,1741898781.0,digitalminimalism,1,0.84,False

2) sales optimization (identifying peak hours, monthly trends / seasonal trends)

3) pricing strategies (maximizing profits) 

Etc.

Before I move forward, I‚Äôd love to hear from coffee shop owners and the community:

1. What are the biggest challenges you face in running a coffee shop?

2. Have you ever analyzed data to improve your business? if not, do you think data analysis could help with these challenges?

3. Would coffee shops owners be interested in a service that analyzes their sales and inventory data to offer actionable insights for a small one time fees?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

He was in my bedroom and decided to say some things that be knew would upset me (has since admitted to trying to piss me off that day) we argued and I told him to get out. A couple minutes after he left the room he came back because he forgot his coffee (this is where I‚Äôm an asshole I admit), this is when I said I spit in his coffee. So yeah I didn‚Äôt spit in his coffee I just figured if he could come into my room and cause issues to ruin my mood, I should be able to ruin his mood too. Immature looking back I know. In response to this he started texting my phone about how he wanted to tell my job I liked spitting in drinks (I work in a restaurant) this is when I told him if he wanted to keep texting me to keep the argument alive I‚Äôll just block him. His response to this was ‚ÄúBlock me then!‚Äù so I walked across the hall to his door said ‚Äúare you sure? positive? this means I won‚Äôt be there for you the next time you need something like toilet paper when you have a shitty ass‚Äù this is when he opened his door and replied that maybe I needed to get raped on the side of the road by an immigrant‚Ä¶ guess he meant this in the way of learning my lesson for blocking him, I couldn‚Äôt call him for help? Anyway I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since, we didn‚Äôt get along for the last decade of my life regardless so it‚Äôs not like we were close. Fast forward to now and my mother says I will need to answer to god for why I never forgave my brother. This felt like a punch in the face and I feel like I don‚Äôt owe anyone forgiveness. When he did try to apologize it ended with him admitting if I was a man he would‚Äôve physically done something that day (exact words were ‚Äúwe would‚Äôve fought if you were my brother‚Äù). So it‚Äôs not like he gave a spectacular apology worth forgiveness‚Ä¶ am I the asshole?


edit: I don‚Äôt know if this helps understand the situation but ever since I was a child my brother has bullied me. We‚Äôre talking breaking an egg on my head at four years old, allowing his friend to shoot me with a bb gun at 7, holding me down and spitting on my face at 8, just to list some core memories. To be honest before this even happened I am just always on guard around him and VERY quick to be defensive. Not that this makes it any better I was an adult at the time and made a comment I shouldn‚Äôt have. I just figured I‚Äôd give more context to our relationship.

For some context, I‚Äôm a 40 year old woman and this story took place in Jan of 2018.  I had recently broken up with a very toxic and abusive person in December of that year. Prior to that, I had started a new job as an electrical assembler. One of my friends whom I had worked with in the past was working there. She had been there about 5ish years I think when I applied. I‚Äôll call her Marie for this story‚Äôs sake. 

After I was hired and had been working there for a few weeks, Marie made mention of her younger brother, let‚Äôs call him Brady who is 7 years younger than me. At that point of my life I wasn‚Äôt looking to jump into another relationship with a guy. I had seen Brady at work many times but he worked in a different department than I. However there were a few times when I had to go into his area for supplies for a job I was working on, and I‚Äôd catch him out of the corner of my eye ‚Äúchecking me out ‚Äú. 

Fast-forward about a month and I‚Äôm waking up one morning and just casually scrolling through Facebook when I get a friend request from none other than Brady himself! I knew immediately in my head that as soon as I accepted his friend request, that he would start messaging me and my intuition was right because I no sooner accepted the friend request, then he started messaging .

 We were messaging every day and seeing each other at work in passing for a while. Eventually, he got up the courage to ask me to go ‚Äúwheeling‚Äù with him. I‚Äôm a total tomboy so that was right up my ally. 

 A few months go by and we decide to start dating. In the beginning as I‚Äôm sure every girl will say, it was amazing. Typical honeymoon phase. Come 3 months in, I started noticing those red flags- asking me who I‚Äôm talking to, why are these guys commenting/reacting to your posts on social media, why are you wearing makeup-who are you trying to look good for? 
Did I also mention that he was living in MY apt, using MY utilities and eating MY food? 
He did help out with monetary things, but never paid any bills, hardly did any housework unless I bitched at him, and rarely cooked. To be fair, I wasn‚Äôt asking him to. I just assumed he would do at least the bare minimum 

 I knew I should have ended it there, but I had already fallen for him‚Ä¶..HARD! I‚Äôd always stand up for myself and defend himself when he would throw shade my way,  but very slowly, unbeknownst to me, he was starting to chip away little pieces of me. So small I didn‚Äôt notice- I was losing myself. 
I did everything he asked of me to show him how much I cared. I told my family about him, I dropped/blocked people for him. I asked for his approval with outfits I wanted to wear, made sure I had dinner fixed when he came home, made sure I always make enough coffee in the morning for him. I tore myself apart to make him happy. Little did I know, all my efforts were wasted. 

Everything came to a head in August 2018
 We were just getting up and ready for work. I put a skort on- and that‚Äôs where I apparently messed up in his mind. 
Here comes the accusations of cheating blah blah blah. Then he told me he was moving out. I told him fine, but I‚Äôm not helping you move. You want to degrade me like you are and then expect me to help you after?
After work, I came home to him having almost all his things packed. I honestly thought he was bluffing. I‚Äôm not proud to admit it, but I broke down and begged and pleaded for him to stay. No dice. He walked out my door while I was crying in the kitchen. 

He blocked me on social media, but I have my ways of finding out info on someone even if I‚Äôm blocked. Another not proud moment on my part but at that time I just HAD to know what he was saying or doing. 
Turned out after he blocked me,he wrote a few nasty posts about me and shortly after, was already in a new relationship, which I also found out that he had been talking to this woman while we were still together. 

Life went on and I myself found love again and was in a relationship as well and things were awesome- until Brady slid into my DMs. 

 I tried so hard not to fall back down that rabbit hole w Brady, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I still cared deeply about Brady still even tho I was with someone else. All his manipulation techniques worked I guess. Brady tried to get me to leave the man I was with and take him back. I wanted Brady back, but at the same time how was I to know that this time would be different.?

I stayed with the guy I was with for about 2.5 years until I realized that he and I are just better off as friends. He understood. 
 Once I was single, I let Brady know. However he had just gotten into a relationship with someone so I stayed away out of respect. That ended and he came back and we picked up kinda where we left off. 

 I wish I could say things changed, but they didn‚Äôt and for 6 years off and on it was a game to him. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take OP off the shelf for a bit until a shinnier new ‚Äútoy‚Äù comes along at which point I‚Äôll put OP back on the shelf and play w my new toy until I get bored or the girl  sees thru my bullshit and kicks me to the curb. Then, at which point let‚Äôs take OP back off the shelf again-dust her off a bit and rinse and repeat‚Äù

I commend you if you‚Äôre still reading and I promise I‚Äôm almost at the end!

The very last time I saw Brady was when I was kicking him out of my house yet again. Mind you, the whole 6 years of off and on, he would always stay at my house RENT FREE!

 The day of August 31st 2023, is a day burned into my brain. The morning started normal, but again where I ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù in his mind was me taking my phone into the bathroom and closing the door to pee while scrolling on social media. 
Me doing that instantly made him think that I‚Äôm cheating/talking to other men. He left in a huff and I just finished getting ready and went to work. 

When I got home, he wasn‚Äôt there so I ended up going over to my besties who lives up the road from me. Got home a little after 7pm and then Brady arrived. I was in the bedroom, watching some shows when I can hear him fumbling around with stuff in the living room and then banging around some stuff in the kitchen. He then comes into the bedroom and just starts screaming at me ‚Äúso what are you just not gonna fucking eat dinner?‚Äù To which I reply I‚Äôve already eaten at my besties‚Äôs house and I even texted you telling you where I was. He goes back into the kitchen mumbling to himself. I walk out and ask ‚Äúare you upset because I didn‚Äôt make you dinner?‚Äù His response: ‚ÄúWell fucking yea like come on you didn‚Äôt think that I might be hungry?‚Äù Me: ‚Äú I txted you saying I was at my besties house and to stop over cuz you were invited for supper ‚Äú  To which his response was ‚ÄúI never got that message. You were probably doing something you shouldn‚Äôt have been.‚Äù I showed him my phone so he can see that I did indeed send him a text message, and He instantly grabs my phone and starts going through it. 

He finds nothing and seems to be a little upset about that. I have NEVER once cheated on him, never spoken to another guy that wasn‚Äôt in a platonic tone and I have never gotten all dolled up with the intentions of impressing a guy. I was faithful and loyal anytime he and I were ‚Äúon‚Äù. 

 And at that moment, everything that I had felt for him,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all of the love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all of the respect that I still had for him instantly switched off. I was finally DONE with all of his bullshit. 

He was mumbling under his breath that he was just gonna move out that weekend to which I told him ‚Äúno you can move out right now.‚Äù He and I argued some more to the point where I told him ‚Äúyou have two options, you can either leave on your own, or I can call the authorities and make a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be.‚Äù 
Cue nasty name calling, more threatening gestures- throwing my phone at me several times and getting inches away from my face with a butter knife as he had decided on making himself a grilled cheese. I knew that  this night‚Äòs not gonna get any better unless I get some help so I dialed 911.

The whole time I‚Äôm talking to dispatch he is under the impression that I am just bluffing, that I didn‚Äôt really call the cops. I turned my phone to him to so he could see that I was in an active call with 911. It was only then that he started packing his shit . 

Three State Troppers  showed up to my house that night. Nothing got physical. Nothing got broken. I didn‚Äôt press charges or take out an ROAF on him. All I wanted was for him to leave my house. He packed all of his things in his truck and he left. Then, true to form, he blocked me on everything.
I was leaning very heavily on my bestie for support while I was going through this.  I met both her and her husband thru Brady as well as a bunch of other people over the years. Small town life. 

A few months after the breakup, my bestie stopped responding to my messages and she wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls This continued for almost a year and then I noticed her social media presence was gone. I couldn‚Äôt find any of her socials.

 At that time I knew she was going through some stuff in her marriage so I was trying to be respectful of that and give her the space. 

A year goes by and I still haven‚Äôt heard from her so throwing caution for the wind, I messaged her husband asking if she had deleted her social media because I could not find her anywhere. He read the message and then he immediately called me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶oh boy

Come to find out that Brady and my best friend have been hooking up! Her husband filed for divorce in October. Upon hearing this, the only emotion I felt was just shocked. I wasn‚Äôt mad I wasn‚Äôt upset just shocked. I never would‚Äôve expected something like that to come from her , but I guess find out who your true friends are. You know Brady told me when he left that night that he was going to ruin my life but whose life is actually ruined? He still lives at his mom‚Äôs house because  he doesn‚Äôt know how to manage/save money, can‚Äôt keep a job for longer than a year and is just a mooch. Now he can add ruining a marriage and friendships to that list. So Brady, I gotta ask, whose life did you ruin again? ",1,1741898520.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I take a peek around and, notice there isn't any obvious cameras, he doesn't have a dash cam. Okay, you know my overhead really needs a little bit of lubing done. I got a spray bottle it has a product called moovit, a light clear penetrating oil. 

I accidentally got some overspray on his windshield, like two pumps worth. Stupid clumsy spray bottles, really needs to be a better way.

So fill up, pull up. Get my free coffee (thank you pilot app)

1jalv1a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jalv1a,Mexico (Oaxaca & CDMX) - 7 day work trip - 28L(+),"I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.

Please note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.

I am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!

**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***

* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.

**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***

* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.

**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**

* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.
* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.
* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.
* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \- Worn once or twice apiece.
* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.
* *1x Prana polo* \- See above.
* 1x *Generic henley* \- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.
* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.
* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.
* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.
* *Bedrock Cairns* \- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.

**Worn**

* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \~20F.
* *Lems Trailheads* \- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.
* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.
* *Generic cap*
* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*
* *ExOfficio briefs*
* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*
* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*

**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**

* *Oral hygiene* \- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss
* *Pills* \- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins
* *Deodorant* \- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill
* *Other* \- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor

**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**

* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.
* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \[not pictured\]*
* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \[not pictured\]*
* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.
* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*
* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*
* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.
* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.
* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).

**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**

* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.
* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*

**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**

* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.
* *Light cotton tote bag* \- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.
* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.
* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.
* *Chums wallet* \- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.
* *Small paperback book \[not pictured\]* \- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.
* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*

**Takeaways from the trip**

* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.
* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.
* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",11,1741897685.0,onebag,1,0.93,False

So, I (24F) have a bit of a situation with someone I knew from high school. Let's call her Duolingo Owl (25F). We had one class together back in the day, and we barely talked. After graduation, she found me on social media and asked to meet up. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude, so I agreed.

Here‚Äôs the thing: she doesn‚Äôt live in our hometown anymore, but every time she‚Äôs back (a couple of times a year), she asks if we can grab coffee. I‚Äôve agreed each time because, honestly, it‚Äôs only like 2-4 times a year, and I thought I could handle it.

Problem is, when we meet up, she‚Äôs really boring. She doesn‚Äôt engage with what I say or seem interested in anything I talk about. It feels like she‚Äôs just waiting for her turn to speak rather than actually listening. We have different senses of humor, different interests, and honestly, we just don‚Äôt click. It‚Äôs awkward and forced, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm enjoying the time at all. But since it‚Äôs only a couple of times a year, I figured I could endure it. That was until she started texting me more frequently, even when she‚Äôs not in town.

I should also mention that while I consider her more of a loose acquaintance, I think she considers me a friend (and I don't think she has many friends). I feel bad about this because I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings, but at the same time, I just don‚Äôt feel any kind of connection with her.

At first, I was going to send her a ""break-up"" text, telling her that I just wasn‚Äôt feeling this ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù anymore. But a close friend of mine told me that sending such a message would be hurtful and that it would be better if I just ghosted her. So I tried ghosting, but here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì she‚Äôs un-ghostable. She just keeps texting me even though I‚Äôm not replying. And I‚Äôm honestly a terrible ghoster because I always end up answering at some point, which just keeps the cycle going.

Another friend told me that ghosting is kind of a cowardly move, and I can‚Äôt really argue with that. So now I‚Äôm in a dilemma. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings, but I don‚Äôt know how else to end this without being really blunt. AITA if I just keep trying to ghost her, even though it‚Äôs clearly not working? Or should I just send that break-up text and rip the Band-Aid off?

TL;DR: I‚Äôve been trying to distance myself from a girl I barely know, but every time I try to back off, she texts me more. AITA if I continue to ghost her even though it‚Äôs clearly not working, or should I just send a ‚Äúbreak-up‚Äù text?",3,1741897654.0,AITAH,3,0.81,False
1jaltyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1jaltyp/cats_wont_stop_fighting_help/,Cats wont stop fighting! help!,"Hello, 

A little over a year ago I moved in with my boyfriend into his apartment who has two male cats (7y) and I have one female cat (3y). 

We made sure to do a very slow introduction, it was about 3 months before they actually saw each other face to face, not just interacting under the door.

At first it went okay, the cats were civil and the boys were very patient with my girl cat (she's a very anxious cat). They would sit there and sniff eachother, but if they moved too fast it would scare her and cause her to growl (never swat or make contact just warning noises) 

Fast forward to the last 5 months, the cats will NOT get along to the point they draw blood and most days the male cats will quite literally attack my female cat on sight. 
More often than not when I come home from work someone has scratches on their face, things are knocked off shelves and clothes are torn from hangers in the closet. 
(today my coffee maker was broken and pieces were scattered down the hall) 

I know it's more than likely redirect anger as it tends to be if they're hungry, or not getting the amount of attention they want in the moment but I'm at my wits end with it. 

We obviously wouldn't get rid of any of the cats but it feels inhumane to keep them living like this. 
I want to reintroduce them but they would tear a hold through the door before I would ever be able to separate them again like they were before. 

Our apartment isn't that small, it's 2 bedrooms with a large livingroom/ dininroom. We have multiple cat trees, 3 litter boxes in different areas of the apartment and so many toys and places for them to hide.  

I have used a feliway diffuser when moving into a new apartment before, would that be something that's worth getting again for behavioral issues? 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

In the FAQ is stated that common signs of overdoing TRE are:

* *Increased anxiety or irritability*
* *Insomnia or disturbed sleep*
* *Feeling tense, restless, or overstimulated*
* *Headaches, nausea, or dizziness*
* *Digestive issues*

But then in the article on trauma work it is written that during the natural process of bringing long-held patterns to the surface and releasing them, many of the same symptoms can occur:

*""Anxiety, sadness, frustration, or even anger may arise seemingly out of nowhere. Old physical symptoms, such as tension in the jaw, stomach discomfort, or headaches, may temporarily return as the body processes these stored imprints.""*

So say that I'm a beginner without severe trauma who has been doing TRE for about a month at the starting frequency of 10-15min every other day. I then take a break of about a week due to not feeling well. When I've recovered and start again with the sessions at the same frequency, I feel good and on an upward trajectory for the first two sessions, but then after the third session, I start to have difficult emotions/sensations the day after - listlessness, anger, frustration, stomach ache, feeling heavy and bloated.

How can I tell if what I'm feeling there is just a normal ""healthy"" emotional release for me to embrace, or if its a sign I have been overdoing it and should consider pausing again and adjusting my practice?

I'm noticing that this uncertainty is becoming a hindrance for me to accept difficult emotions brought up by TRE and surrender to the process, because whenever I feel negative emotions after a session it just causes me to over-analyze and obsess about whether I'm doing it right and should stay the course, or if I rather need to re-evaluate my practice. Or if there are other things in my life I should be doing to make it work better, like maybe I'm drinking too much coffee in the morning, or not doing enough walking in nature, or not eating right, or not having enough screen-free time in the evening, or masturbating too much. Even though I would like to just follow my intuition when it comes to these things, its hard not to wonder when you are experiencing difficult emotions.

To add, I've been doing different psychospiritual modalities like meditation, breathwork, cold exposure, yoga, martial arts, dancing and qi gong for 10+ years, but after 1 month of TRE I'm starting to feel like they only scratched the surface of my accumulated or inherited trauma.",4,1741897346.0,longtermTRE,3,0.83,False

This remarkable‚Å§ feat of engineering means ‚Å£you can enjoy ice-cold‚Äå water on‚Äã a scorching summer hike or piping ‚Å£hot coffee‚Å£ during a chilly winter camping trip.

Available in a wide array of colors, finding the perfect Hydro Flask‚Äã 64 oz colors to match your personal style is a breeze. Weather you prefer the‚Å£ classic Hydro Flask 64 oz black or the vibrant Hydro Flask ‚Äç64 ‚Å§oz pacific, there‚Äôs‚Äç a hue to suit every taste. The Hydro Flask 64 oz alpine color is also a popular choice for that rugged, outdoorsy aesthetic.

the Hydro Flask 64oz's wide mouth design makes it ‚Å§incredibly convenient to fill, pour, and ‚Å¢clean.
