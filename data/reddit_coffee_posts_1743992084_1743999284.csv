I lost 25lbs so far, and have 40lbs to go to hit my first milestone and first goal (I was 225lbs pre-pregnancy, and had lost 130lbs prior to that). Gaining back 65lbs of that was hard but I would do anything for my son. 

My overall goal is 185lbs. Eventually. But I like incremental goals. 

My question is, could I lose 25-30lbs with working out 5x week (weightlifting + cardio, totaling 1.5hr since that’s all I can do with a baby! Haha) for 8-9 weeks?

--------------------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pL62Y7rU4h): **March 20, 2025**

To give y'all a bit of background, I (30F) moved to the UK nearly 7 years ago from the US. I was able to get a UK passport from my father who immigrated to the US where he met my mother. She actually fled to the US from South America. After university, I decided to live and travel throughout Asia and the Middle East for a few years teaching English in poor (and sometimes dangerous) areas before I finally made the decision to go back to my roots and move to Europe for good. **(All of this is important for later!)**

4 years in, I met the love of my life and we got married. We decided to buy a house in the countryside and as we are getting things ready with the mortgage his family was kind enough to let us move in to their home for the time being. This was a massive change for me but I didn't care as I grew to be a part of his family including his only brother, Matt, who I consider to be the brother I never had. My husband and I were there whenever Matt went through breakups and gave him dating advice whenever he was seeing someone new until he finally met, Vicky. When we met her we thought she was sweet, down to earth, and didn't take herself too seriously which is what Matt needed but over time she started to display questionable behaviour traits.

Once at the dinner table, I said something about being Latina and she said, ""well at least youre not a dirty Indian."" Mind you, my husband, Matt, and I are all for some dark humor but that comment almost knocked me off my chair. In fact, I don't think we all think she said what she said because it was so out of the blue. She was obviously trying to be funny so we all laughed but it was obvious that it made us uncomfortable. 

Another time, I took my husband to Turkey for his birthday and I sent a video to our family group chat of him sun tanning by our hotel's pool with the sound of the call to prayer echoing from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofya. As a response she texted, ""that sound would freak me out"" clearly suggesting that it sounds like a s\*\*\*ide boomer. I can see how that would fly over people's heads but I knew what she was talking about but I get it, she has never been to the Middle East so as someone who has lived there I took the time to educate her on what the call to prayer is and how it's actually beautiful.

However it wasn't until yesterday when I've had enough of her closed minded remarks that she clearly tries to pass off as light hearted jokes. As I mentioned, the family has a group chat where we send memes and jokes to each other at times. As you can image, Vicky sometimes doesn't know how to read the room and sends inappropriate memes to the family and yesterday she sent a meme that was a picture of a huge group of immigrants on an inflatable raft in middle of the ocean with a caption that said, ""Where's Jaws when you need him?"" My husband thought it was too much and so did his mum. I, on the other hand, was like HELL TO THE ABSOLUTE AND DEFINITE FUCK NO!

I was this close to going on the group chat and calling her out for the bigot she was in front of everyone but my husband stopped me so I decided to spare the drama and DM her. I told her that was a fucked up joke especially considering that SHE KNOWS that both of my parents were immigrants wherein which my mom had to flee her own country. She immediately started apologising and saying that she ""didn't know"" which I found hard to believe. We've known each other for a year and we've discussed this before so either she's lying or stupid.

She immediately deleted the meme off the chat along with the GIF of her giggling about it as a response to my MIL reacting with a ""shocked face"" emoji. This morning she sent me a long paragraph about how she is upset that she upset me and that she loves me and that I'm like a sister to her. I appreciate her apologising and all but it really gives me the ick to associate with anyone who thinks it's funny to joke about wishing death upon a certain type of people. Is she that closed minded or is she that desperate for attention that she's trying to get it in the wrong way? I completely understand that she doesn't come from the same background as me or had the opportunities to travel like I did therefore it's natural to be ignorant and I don't want to fall out with Matt. And this has nothing to do with politics or anything it's just a cruel thing to say and there is such thing as a bad joke.

So would I be the AH if I flat out call her a racist/bigot the next time I see her and distance myself from her or should I just accept her apology and drop it?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP had the majority of NTAs and few YTAs**

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTAH. Just asking, Is Vicky American, perchance? Anyway, ignore her as though you’ve accepted her weird apology. But the minute that kind of BS rolls out of her again, roll your eyes at her and tell her directly that NO ONE in the family finds that kind of “humor” at all funny so please…..just don’t. Move the convo on quickly so she hasn’t time to be upset.

> **OOP:** Nope! British but sort of like the ""redneck"" version of a Brit... I was the one born and raised in the US but I've travelled and more ""culturally experienced"" than her... ironic isnt it?

**Commenter 2:** You've already called her out and there is the distant chance she learned her lesson and you are going to have to be around her until they break up.

Personally, I wouldn't call her out for the meme again - but STOP with the ""laughing because you are uncomfortable"". You've told her all along through those actions that you are ok with her passive aggressive racism. Frankly, the fact that she said ""Dirty Indian"" and you all said nothing because it didn't directly insult you or your family? Shame on you.

But she'll do it again and you need to be ready to respond. ""I'd be scared of that sound"" - ""Why would you be scared of that??? Explain it to me like I'm 5"". (Asking why something is scary/funny/whatever when you know it is a subtle racist dig always flusters them) ""Dirty Indian"" - ""What the fuck? That is a fucked up racist thing to say""

I'd give the brother a heads up that you are embarrassed that you let it slide until now and you are no longer tolerating it. Frankly, the fact that he's with someone like that makes me think he's racist too. I wouldnt' share a cup of coffee with someone like that, let alone sleep with them.

**Commenter 3:** She's also self-absorbed and clueless. She doesn't think of others before blurting out whatever stupid, offensive thought pops into her mind.  She's in her own bubble. Hopefully she won't make the same mistake again, but if she does, feel free to tell her,  ""Vicky, dear, please think before you blurt out inappropriate jokes/comments"".

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/yjeGsKDlz0): **March 31, 2025 (11 days later)**

Last I left it, I said that Vicky sent a long paragraph with a dramatic apology saying that I am ""like a sister to her"" but after reading a few comments I realised a few point: first off, how can she consider me as ""a sister"" when she clearly doesn't know me and never even cared to know me. 

Secondly, Vicky is only apologising because she got called out and NOT because she realised that the meme she sent was out of line. I could probably forgive her if this was an isolated incident but it wasn't. As I mentioned, she made racist comments twice before but never got called out for it and now that she has she's all of a sudden apologetic? If no one have ever said anything I guarantee she would still think those kind of jokes are okay.

I ignored her apology at first but when Sunday came around and she and Matt were planning to come for our family dinner day she texted me again asking if ""we are okay"" and the only reply I could give her was, ""I accept your apology...put it that way."" It didn't take long for her to cry to Matt about it who then called his mother to bitch about how mean I was being and how they are ""scared"" to come to dinner for fear of what I might say or stir up a bad atmosphere. I told my husband to explain to his mother that I am not one to cause a show especially in their house that they were so gracious to let us stay in while we were moving house. I have accepted Vicky's apology and will be ""civil"" meaning if she wants to speak to me I will listen and answer but I will NOT go out of my way to speak to her.

My husband and I were out for a bit seeing a friend for a bit before we had our family dinner. When we came back there was Matt and Vicky sitting on the couch. The moment I walked in Matt had this uncomfortable smirk on this face. The kind of smirk you make when someone you hate walks in to the room and makes eye contact with you and you have to be ""nice"" about it. Vicky gave me a ""hi"" in the voice of a mouse and immediately started having a staring contest with the floor which was fine considering I made ZERO eye contact with her throughout the whole evening. 

When we were at the table I was chatty and made it out to seem that I was unbothered meanwhile Vicky was across the table acting all quiet and sad and making the situation awkward. Eventually, she texted Matt under the table saying that she wanted to leave once dinner was finished. Mom and Dad knew the reason why Vicky and Matt left so quickly and they became upset. They had a go at my husband about why I can't ""let it go"" and how I was the one that made Vicky uncomfortable with the way I did not speak let alone look at her once the entire time. 

I defended myself to my husband saying that she and Matt were the ones that made it awkward from the second I walked into the room. Not to mention that if Vicky truly wanted to square things away she should've pulled me aside to talk instead of thinking that things are gonna be easily settled through a text message. I always found her to be the type that constantly plays the victim but now I feel like she's trying to rope the family into thinking that I am the AH just because I refuse to let a ""stupid joke"" that was a ""mistake"" to post slide and play nice for the sake of peace in the family.

Now, I don't know what to do as everyone in the family is thinking that it is up to me to fix this even though I wasn't the one who stupidly posted a shitty joke on the family group chat.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** To reinforce, you're NTA. Vicky's playing the victim because now she knows you won't let her get away with her stupid remarks anymore. If your in-laws engage you directly over this, explain again to them that you will be civil to Vicky and any silent tantrum her and Matt cause over you not being buddy-buddy with her while she acts like this is on those two and not you.

You might want to also ask them that if Vicky was making horrible remarks about something personal to them or their family backgrounds, would they just 'let it slide' for the sake of now-uncomfortable family peace.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Vicky is evil. She knows exactly what she's doing. She's extremely manipulative.

Your husband's family is going to be in a world of hurt as long as Vicky is allowed to play family members against each other. She's already managed to isolate you and make them believe that it's ALL up to YOU to make your relationship work.

She's playing the ""long"" game. Don't play. Step away from her and Matt. Learn to gray rock. Continue to be civil.

Have a serious discussion with your husband about all of this. You and he may consider having a meeting with his parents. Write down past instances of her putting you down and how it makes you feel.

Your ILs don't want to ""rock the boat"" for whatever reason.....and I can't think of any reason unless they're afraid to lose Matt (who is eating up the BS). They really need their eyes open to how evil Vicky is.

Don't go to ILs if she and Matt are there.

i haven’t been a barista for that long but even before i was, i would try to learn the differences between drinks especially before i would go in and order something. i’m just into coffee as a hobby so maybe that’s why?? but it feels like that’s what you should do

and the worst part is that i’m usually on bar making the drinks and customers will come to me asking to know why their drink “is like that” and i have a lot of anxiety when it comes to talking and when people come up to me have no idea what to say 

usually “sorry that’s a macchiato, what were you looking for?” it kills me inside everytime because i’m so quiet it comes off as passive and rude and i’m really not trying to be, even if it is annoying people keep doing this

does this happen with anyone else ?? i assume it wouldn’t happen at starbucks or major chains but i dunno

It’s an internship at a solid company. In the beginning everything was going great and I made several friends including Chelsea (26F). Chelsea has been my friend since the beginning and we share everything with each other and often go out for coffee and lunch. Nothing romantic or sexual between us at all. It’s completely platonic. 

The problem started in November when I got transitioned under Ryan (43M). Ryan has a narcissistic personality. This is pretty well known throughout the office. Ryan loves ragging on the “new guy” and since I’ve been the new guy since November, I’ve been the one who’s getting the brunt of it. Now I have a pretty thick skin so I don’t get bothered by it easily. Ryan noticed this and started really cracking down and started embarrassing me in meetings and giving me busy work so that I have less time to do the real work. After 6 weeks of dealing with Ryan I started looking for new jobs around December. I got an incredible offer in the beginning of March, but my new job doesn’t start until June. Obviously I need to pay the bills so I’m stuck working with Ryan for another 2 months. Until then I’m just making sure no issues happen so that Ryan doesn’t try to sabotage my new job. 

Ok, so getting back to Chelsea. Chelsea doesn’t work directly under Ryan but she knows Ryan pretty well. Chelsea is also the only one who knows about my new job. Chelsea has been pressuring me to go to HR about Ryan’s behavior. But I’ve told her I just want the next two months to go by smoothly and get out of here. Well the other day Chelsea and I were hanging out in her office and Ryan comes in. For the purpose of being anonymous, I’m not going to say what happened next. However, Ryan said something to me that was definetly a fireable offense. 

After that happened, Chelsea told me I HAVE to report Ryan. But I said no and just left. Well it turns out that Chelsea took it upon herself to go to HR directly. HR called me into their office and asked me for my side of the story. I explained what happened and said it wasn’t a big deal. HR dropped the issue but word got around and Ryan found out about it, and now he’s trying to get her fired. 

Now Chelsea is mad at me and won’t talk to me. She says that if I had reported him earlier and pressed more, and told them everything Ryan has done in the past, he could have gotten fired. But it’s MY prerogative whether or not I decide to report. I understand that she thinks that me letting it slide means that it will affect other people too but, to be completely honest, I’m looking out for me and what’s best for my future.

I worked in finance for the last 5 years and got fired right before my wedding. We moved to a new city (dallas) right after the wedding which was in June for my husbands job and have been here for the last 6 months. I got a job as a barista a few months into living here and have liked it quite a bit until now. The primary age range for the other baristas is 18-23 and I’m 29 and obviously married / in a different stage of life than most of them. They are all just such a different vibe than me and a lot of them are quite cliquey . I feel like I unintentionally annoy some of them for example one of my coworkers got annoyed at me today when I said I hoped I got to go home early. Also Bob didn’t say hi to me when I walked passed her and she just got to the shop. It’s just little things like that that make me feel so out of place. I shared something with one of the baristas that bothered me about Bob specifically and she just told the story to everyone and used it as gossip rather than trying to empathize with me. Is this my push to get another job? Why do I care so much what they think of me? I’m not actively trying to be friends with them. Although it does make me sad that a lot of them follow each other on instagram and none follow me.

It’s important to me to be mindful in how I approach the search and I’ve realized that perhaps the apps aren’t for me, as every time I’ve tried and no matter what amount of discretion I practice, I still walk away traumatized which carries into how I view the male marriage market IRL.

As my flair suggests, I am indeed divorced and had met my ex husband organically through the Muslim community. In an ideal world, even though my marrriage didn’t work out, I would like that again so as to be able to see a man (and be seen as a woman) by who I am and how I act in the day to day instead of anything that’s curated. The problem isn’t a lack of interest, it’s moreso that I am in my 30s and look younger alhamdulilah whereas many men that are single and open about their search in the community are much younger (20-23) or men that think my morals are different now that I’m divorced.

A lot of the “advice” I get is to go to the coffee shops and while I do meet up with friends there or work out of them every so often. It’s just the thought of dressing up, going to them at some odd hour of the night, with the intention of catching a man’s eye just does not sit well with me. I suppose my thought process is that if I am in bed and asleep before midnight and that is the type of life I would want, why should I be out at 2am when I would hope that my naseeb is also not the type of guy that’s out till 2am hanging with the bros and ogling women either?

Most of the events in my community are gender segregated so there isn’t much opportunity there and when there is, admittedly I am extremely shy and would first turn into a puddle before I could ever approach a brother.

I’m willing to take advice in terms of how I should approach the situation differently to ensure I am doing my part in tying the camel, as well as of course making dua. ",1,1743997197.0,Muslim,0,1.0,False

1jtbxsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1jtbxsm/methods_that_helped_me_quit/,Methods that helped me quit.,"(This is quite a long post, probably about 10 minutes of reading time.) 

Keep in mind I have tried quitting about 4 times in the span of 1 - 2 years before relapsing again. I plan to quit come November of this year, or very early next year. These are some of the techniques and methods i came up with that I noticed helped me a fair bit. I hope it can help you in your journey too!


1. Regret/guilt tripping self - this is quite a toxic way of thinking and it *will* put pressure on your brain, but if you can handle it I highly recommend telling yourself this when emotions for cravings are high: *""if I give in now, I will loose all my progress I have made so far. I have told my family, friends, ect that I am quitting and they have so much faith in me. What will they think of me if I give in now?""* Or, *""what will I think of myself if I give in now?""* This is sort of similar to guilt tripping yourself into not caving, but it can potentially have the opposite effect. Like I said, be aware of how much stress your mental state can manage, and go from there. You don't want to over exert yourself *to* the point you cave.

2. Having a non nicotine vape - this helped in tremendous ways for me since I use my vape with almost anything I do. Having a non nic one helped a lot, because it mimics the same actions as you would a normal one. Almost like tricking your brain in a sense. I also found it helped my cravings a little more too.

3. Crying - literally just crying for however long you need to. Anywhere, anytime. Just do it if you have to lol.

4. Keeping your real vape locked up - this was the only method that worked for my longest time without vaping (1 and a half weeks). Granted it didn't work the 2nd or 3rd time, but it did help my brain in saying ""it's still there whenever you need it"" in the back of my mind (I was using a non nic vape at the time too) Somehow knowing it wasn't ""gone forever"" but rather still there helped so much for me. My cravings would have been probably a lot worse if I had thrown it out, for some reason cold turkey/completely throwing away all of my vapes just didn't work for me and made me more scared. I was able to go out with friends while still knowing it was right back at home just in case. That's what kept my mind slightly more sound, and also what probably allowed me to keep going vape free for as long as I did (I did have nicotine spray though, and a non nic vape for that week).

5. spicy/sour food - I've never tried this one before but once I quit again I plan to. I'm thinking that spicy food and extremely sour food (e.g sour candies that almost make your eyes water, curry, ect) has the same effect on mental/emotional cravings like it would with anxiety: by distracting the brain from negative emotions, and eating something that is very spicy or sour can potentially give your brain a quick ""reset"" until the taste goes away.

Alternatively, you can try this method by having a cold shower instead, or dunking your face into ice cold water. I'm pretty sure it has a very similar effect (resetting the brain for a moment I mean).

6. Listening to positive music - I found that listening to empowering and bouncy, upbeat, instrumental/calming music or music that scratches my brain helped a fair bit, especially when I was alone and dealing with cravings by myself. I made myself a positive playlist, and listened to it on repeat. 

7. Hanging out with friends, going out to events, dinners, ect - this may be hard to do for the first week / 2 weeks, but if you aren't around people/friends that vape or smoke (like I currently am) I found that if I could pay attention to my friends or family, even just going out to explore places with them, was beneficial because it provides natural dopamine, same as playing games or gacha games on your phone or tablet would.

8. Being creative/journalling - if you have a creative mind or like to draw, make music, write, journal, ect: do it! I found drawing, doodling or finishing an art piece based on what I was feeling in the moment really helped me be able to just take a small breather, even if it were short lived. Reading a book and getting lost in the story can distract your brain for a little bit too. Journalling what I was feeling helped a lot, or even just talking/venting to someone who had quit successfully. You can find so much motivation from them, for me it was like ""if they did it, then so can i!""

9. Studying/working - this can go either way. You don't want to pile yourself up with work/study so at the end of the day, your brain will be tired and say, ""I need a pick me up - how about a vape?"" Instead, pace yourself if possible (if your work is flexible/you have enough time in the day to complete certain tasks so your able to pace yourself) throughout the day, let your brain work until it's *slightly* tired - not to the point of mental exhaustion. I found if i worked continuously with no breaks in between, once my brain was exhausted it would automatically think, ""okay it's vape time now"". Whereas when I paced myself and took short breaks (5 - 10 minutes) on my phone or gaming, my brain was able to continue working more and the need for said vape break wouldn't be clouded in my mind as much. However again, this varies depending on the person and may not work for some or would need to reverse this method. I also found if i needed a ""pick me up"" I'd just have a monster energy (iced coffee or actual coffee made cravings worse) and that would help a little too, but again in moderation! Sometimes energy drinks can have the opposite effect on what you want them to, especially quitting an addiction and could potentially just make your brain more active after work/studying.

Now, a quick run down of *things that can potentially make cravings/emotional cravings worse.*

Drinking/other - I found that drinking to try and cure the mental cravings only made them worse, and it only made my anger, sadness, ect worse too. This varies greatly for different people though, but once you think you are ready to start drinking again then go for it, but I would advise against it in the early stages if possible. I'm not too sure about weed though, I've never used weed when quitting so if you find it works for you, then it works. If it doesn't or makes cravings or mental state worse then that is your choice to make.

Being alone - dealing with cravings emotionally by self isolating can potentially make them worse, or it at least did for me. I'm not saying to have friends/people around you all the time either, because you need your own space too, just make sure your at the very least socializing with someone at least once a day/every two days if you can, whether it's texting, calling, or just visiting the store to grab groceries. Maybe even have someone like a friend or partner come with you for support in the first week if you know you'll pass the store you go to get vapes on the way.

I hope any of these tactics can help you on your journey - you got this!!",1,1743996370.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

We talked for maybe an hour and it was a great time. We seem to get along, some common interests and plenty to talk about. The whole time I was thinking “if only she was like 4 or 5 years older I wouldnt feel so weird about this”

Idk if I should pursue this or not due entirely to the age gap. It didn’t feel like I was talking to someone way younger than me and she actually looks older for her age too (that doesnt really matter). Shes beautiful af and is in the military so she has a sense of responsibility and adulting

1jtbv8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/treeplanting/comments/1jtbv8a/tree_planters_of_bc/,Tree Planters of BC,"Tree planters are probably the vilest, most disgusting group of foul-mouthed degenerates to be a part of the working class today... and I’m proud to be one of them. It’s a hard job that makes hard people, and unlike most jobs bad hygiene, excessive drug use, and a “who gives a shit” attitude are basically prerequisites. If you happen to live in a small town close to any industrial logging you can often spot tree planters during the summer months walking through town on their days off. They are easy to pick out of a crowd because their matted hair, scratched and dirt-soaked skin, weird tan lines and overall attire resembles that of a person who was just rescued from a desert island. You can readily find them either at the laundromat washing a pile of tattered rags that look like something a homeless person had just thrown away, or at the local liquor store stocking up for another four or five days in the bush. By all appearances tree planters are a group that was scraped off the underbelly of society for an insane mission only they were dumb or desperate enough to do. And if you ever have the misfortune of meeting one of these people during the planting season you will get the distinct impression that the job of planting trees must be some sort of government-funded outreach program designed as a last resort/Hail Mary attempt to integrate these people back into the working class and have them contribute in some meaningful way to society before they turn to either petty crime or drug-induced homelessness. However, while the tree planting lifestyle does tend to attract a certain number of societal outcasts, most tree planters are not like that at all. Many are students or working professionals that are in between jobs and just wanted to try something wild and completely different from any job they have ever had before…many of them end up loving it and return for many years. People get into tree planting for plenty of different reasons and from all different backgrounds, but the moment a person becomes a planter they turn into something completely indistinguishable from the drug-fueled hippie planter that couldn’t hold down a regular job if their life depended on it. This happens because of the social structure of the tree planting camp. In camp no one cares whether you’re a student, a rich doctor, or a high school dropout without a penny to your name. Everyone in camp is treated as equals and the only social hierarchy that exists is based solely on how many trees you can put in the ground in a 10-hour day. The top planters in the camp are viewed as kings. Their life can be in complete shambles in every other area but if they can plant more trees than everyone else, they are seen as a god among mere mortals. And for good reason…. planting a lot of trees is a really difficult thing to do. It’s hard mentally, physically, and emotionally.

Mentally there is actually a lot to think about when learning to plant and a rookie planter has to eat, sleep, and breath planting if he wants to be any good at it. Spacing and tree density, how to fill a piece most efficiently, how to take fewer steps, how to see the soft ground… everything is about how to shave a half second off each tree. You start to time your pee breaks and eat your lunch while repacking your bags. You never sit down because it slows your body down and you stop carrying your water with you so you can carry more trees. Planting is all a rookie can talk or think about, and after planting all day they will go to bed and dream about planting trees. The amount of dedication required to develop such a niche ability with almost no transferable skills is kind of insane, but if you want to be any good at it, that’s what is required. To learn to be a planter you must forget about how sore and tired you are, since thoughts of wanting to go home or take a break are mental obstacles in the way of planting more trees. Personal hygiene and your appearance become an afterthought and you no longer care about what is going on in the outside world, you even stop caring that you have no cell service. Much like a reclusive genius fixated on a particular problem, a rookie planter becomes obsessed with one question... how can I plant more trees?

And if you haven’t gathered yet, tree planting is obviously very physically demanding. The simple act of bending over two to four thousand times a day is exhausting enough, then add three to four hundred trees on your back and the steep landscape littered with fallen trees and brush that makes for a truly difficult climb. Your first week you will be so exhausted that any food you can quickly scarf down while refilling your bags will inevitably come back up twenty minutes later, no time to go back for water though, just keep planting and hope that you packed an extra sandwich. When evening finally comes you hit the pillow hard, completely exhausted. The rough rocky ground under your tent feels more comfortable than your bed at home and you sleep more soundly than ever in your life. But then all too soon morning comes, and with it all the aches and stiffness that comes from pushing your body to its limit every day and then sleeping on the cold ground with a rock for back support. There’s no sense in complaining about it though, since everyone else is in the same boat and dwelling on how sore you are would only slow you down, so you ignore your body’s screams for help, grab some truly terrible coffee and just walk it off. You see, the key to overcoming the physical adversity of planting trees lies almost entirely in your mental resolve. It’s not about being in the best shape or taking great care of your body, it’s all about pushing your body far beyond what it thinks it can do, regardless of whether it can or not.  Many of the best planters smoked cigarettes and would occasionally show up to the block hungover but it never seems to slow them down. One man who was a personal hero of mine would plant every day in the same clothes and his rubber boots were from the dollar store, he would smoke cigarettes and drink wine all day. In the scorching heat when I felt faint from dehydration I’d look over and see him drinking red wine from a box. And this man would consistently put in at least a thousand more trees than most people in camp. Many people would say that cigarettes and boxed wine would be a hindrance to someone trying to move as fast as they can for ten hours a day, but those people would be wrong. As I said before, the most important part of overcoming the physical adversity of planting is learning how to beat your body into submission. If you’re hungry or thirsty or tired or sick, you tell your body to shut up and keep planting!  When you’re wet and cold from the rain or snow, or when you’re covered in bites from bugs or hornets and you want to cry because you just want to go home, all you can do is tell yourself to stop complaining and then use that frustration as fuel to plant faster. Ignoring your body’s cry for help is the main key to the physical component of planting, and it does get easier as time goes on. Eventually you only feel how sore and tired you are in the morning but by the time you get halfway through your first bag up you feel on top of the world, not only because you’re in the best shape of your life but because for the first time in your life your body isn’t complaining to you about every little ailment. So no, that hero of mine would not have been able to plant more trees had he stopped smoking and bought some appropriate footwear…those things were a part of his method of beating his body down so it couldn’t fight back… or at least that’s how I think he did it.

This method of beating your body into submission ties in nicely to our third and last hardship of planting trees… the emotional toll. Now obviously many of the mental and physical challenges that we already discussed would also present with an emotional cost. Whether it’s from your shovel hitting a rock and sending pain shooting up your arm for the 500^(th) time that day, or from the blackflies driving you within an inch of your sanity… almost every planter has at some point broken down crying on the block. There are plenty of things I could mention that take an emotional toll on a rookie but I think the most difficult emotional aspect of planting lies in the simple fact that technically… you could go home at any time. No one is making you stay and yet something inside you won’t let you leave. Similarly, no one is forcing you to work like a dog, but you can never allow yourself to have a chill day. Imagine a job where your boss doesn’t let you take lunch breaks and gets angry with you every time you’re not moving as fast as you possibly can. He forces you to work outside through all weather, no matter how sore or sick you’re feeling. And when you break down crying because you just can’t take it anymore, he yells at you and tells you that you’re a wimp and to get back to work. Essentially, that’s tree planting in a nutshell… except that the boss is you. Planting is a prison of your own creation where you’re the prisoner, guard, and warden. It’s a torturous existence, knowing that you hold the key to escaping this hell while also having the understanding that if you didn’t see this thing through you would never be able to forgive yourself. An alarming number of people have told me stories of bad days on the block where they had the thought of jumping off something high, or sticking their foot under the truck tire as it drove by in the hopes of breaking a bone and having an excuse to go home. These are the types of insane thoughts that your captive brain has, while the thought of simply giving up and leaving rarely even enters your mind and would never be entertained seriously. Honestly, as hard as it is to not give up halfway through your rookie year, I think it might be even harder to quit and go home if you’re someone with an ounce of self-respect. And sure, you could stick it out for the summer and just not give it your all, but then you’d never really feel like you earned the title of Tree Planter. And so, you stay, you beat your body into submission through working it to death and you take back control of your mind by breaking its will to live.

Why, you might ask, would someone put themselves through all this? Is it for the money? Is it for the friendship? Is it because they hate themselves? Yes to all three, but only when talking about people returning for another season. For a rookie planter however, none of these reasons really apply and you find that the main driving force motivating them to keep at it, and not to quit and go home halfway through the season, is the senseless desire to be able to call oneself a tree planter. It’s such a matter of pride to call yourself a tree planter. A completely worthless title by any normal metric, but a priceless badge of honor for all those who manage to obtain it. There’s a bond amongst tree planters, a kinship that comes from knowing that they overcame the same difficult thing you did, and a mutual respect because you know that underneath all the nicety and phoniness of polite society there is a wild man or woman living inside that is capable of doing some truly appalling things. Because of this, the bond between planters is strong and the friendships you will make in camp will last a lifetime. This is one of the few positive aspects of tree planting and besides the money, it is one of the main reasons why people return for a second year.

Another reason why people fall in love with planting is the ultimate freedom that the lifestyle brings. You are free from all the stresses of life as your rent, your food, and your transportation are all taken care of, and all the problems and stresses of everyday life are put on hold while you focus on this one difficult thing. All the problems going on in the world seem so distant and unimportant, and in most cases you’re not even aware of what’s happening out there anyway because of the lack of cell service. You also get to experience temporary freedom from all social norms, things like personal hygiene, political correctness, and making smart responsible decisions are not commonplace in the tree planting camp. If you don’t shower for a week, or you drink too much, or if you choose to drop acid and wander the forest naked in your spare time, no one will even bat an eye. And as you can imagine because of this free spirted atmosphere, the planter parties are known for their wild, unbridled chaos. “Work hard, play hard” could not be a better description of the planter lifestyle.

  Lastly, you get to experience freedom from yourself. There’s something strangely hypnotic about repeating the same motion over and over thousands of times a day, and once you get into a groove the hours just seem to fly by. Some days you have plenty of time to think, and it forces you to really get to know yourself. But you are also at a place in life where you are willing to give yourself a lot grace for just about everything… except planting slowly of course, and so many people find tree planting to be an extremely healing experience. Other days your brain simply shuts off and you go into auto-pilot, where the day feels like it’s over before it even began and you can hardly remember what happened. But whatever your day on the block was like, when it’s over there is a sigh of relief and an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, knowing that you worked as hard as you could and that you made exactly what you were worth… down to the penny. Then there is the rush you get from having a good tree day and beating your personal best, or even just from making great money that day and knowing that you earned every cent of it. It’s rough, hard work but it’s oddly satisfying. And so, for all these reasons people often seem to develop a strangely affectionate relationship with tree planting. It’s clearly an abusive relationship, but we don’t care. Despite all the shit that comes with it, tree planting will always hold a special place in the heart of anyone that calls themselves a Planter.            ",4,1743996135.0,treeplanting,2,0.75,False

Mental health issues, lack of understanding have come up. I’m discovering new mental health issues I have, I’m juggling being on my own for the first time after being in a very sheltered home as the spoiled last child. He is the opposite of me, grew up an only child and didn’t really have good role models aside from his stepdad who passed away. 
I think the big issue is we don’t know how to navigate towards each others mental health issues. I (26 female) may have grown to be a little mentally checked out, I can’t lie that I don’t take fault in a lot of the constant fights, I am very short tempered and get very overstimulated easily and I’m in constant need to alone time or space in order to restart my social battery. My bf (25 male) suffers from PTSD and gets lonely easily and hates being in his own thoughts. 
Lately, we’ve been fighting way too often, most of it I would say is me not being able to handle my emotions, I’ve been lashing out very easily. I think it stems from deep issues I have about everything that went on that I refuse to communicate anymore to him. I’ve had to help him out financially for awhile, he lost his job, needed help paying for his mortgage and his car. I’ve helped because I know in the past he’s a great hard worker but over time I think I started seeing his lack of worry about money. It becomes last minute and his bills became my problem because no one else in his family is willing to help. Few times is okay but sometime over the years I feel like he only keeps me around because of financial benefits. After I got my own apartment I still had to help for a few months and any topics of his job search, and me saying I can’t pay for his mortgage anymore, it becomes a fight. 
The next thing is despite him having his place, he is constantly at my place 24/7. 
I started seeing his lack of care (anyone can probably guess what it’s like living with a typical man). Even asking him to change the toilet paper turned sour, comments of roommates what not even though I don’t need one, I can afford it. I never ask him to pay rent, just asked for him to pick up after himself but it doesn’t always go in the best conversation. 
I work in healthcare so I get very overstimulated after work but because he’s at my place 24/7 with no job atm, and with his PTSD, I get very overstimulated. Cleaning, doing my own thing, I get bugged to come hang out. 
I’ve tried to come up with a schedule where there are days he can stay over and days he goes stay at his place so I can reset my social battery and also work on myself and figure out what’s my problem and why I’m getting angry so often. I’ve gotten meds to keep my anger down, went to see a psychiatrist but everyone is pretty aware my triggers also stem from him. 
I’ve grown mentally tired and on overblown big fights I break up with him but it never goes that way. He ask me if I really want to I should do it properly like in a coffee shop or something. Which I understand but my mind just goes somewhere else and wants to Idk keep trying? I can’t bring myself to actually sit him down and break up. I hate it. 
I still love him, he’s a good man, he doesn’t cheat and wants to improve our lives but the thing is… I’ve also been feeling not good enough, I’ve been so mentally tired I have no more energy for hobbies, anything. I just shut down. I no longer want to tell him what is bothering me, but he can tell I no longer smile at him and don’t communicate with him. To be fair I see the way he communicates with his grandma and mom, and he dismiss their opinions and words a lot and he does the same to me. His mom and grandma knows how I feel even though they know I should be bettering myself too. 
These fights are not all him, I’m at fault too, do I truly want to break up with him? Not really, he and I don’t want to give up but I find it hard to work on myself and I can’t communicate things to him because he won’t listen. Yeah I’ve thought of couples therapy but that is also up to me to figure out. But I do feel somewhat mentally checked out… There’s somewhere in my brain that tells me if he and I just stick to a schedule and I’m able to get some space and alone time, then I can figure things out and work on myself and I’ll be less irritable rather than seeing him 24/7 other than work and coming home and feeling suffocated. 
AITA… for just not sitting him down and breaking up with him properly instead of always kicking him out and telling him to find someone else and breaking up with him during big fights… ",2,1743996089.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to start by saying I know how charged that word is so please listen to the end before making a judgement. It's a long one so buckle up.

I'm 21 (M), and my ex is currently 20 (F). The story starts in my Senior year of high school. I was the President of my schools top choir and one of my good friends and fellow officers at the time told be about an exchange student that was coming to our school and would be a part of our choir. He wanted us to go to coffee with her and welcome her to our group which I thought was a great idea. We met in a local coffee shop in town and got to know her a little better. She was Italian and had come to study abroad and was randomly chosen to come to our state. For the purposes of this story, I'll call her Jan. Jan was rather quiet and shy during our first meeting, but quickly opened up throughout the year to reveal a BOISTEROUS and amazing personality that I absolutely adored.

We ran in different friend groups, but fell head over heels with each other during a school music department trip to Disney World. I had asked if I could hang out with her and her group and she immediately said yes. I was over the moon excited as frankly I'm not much of a looker and she was STUNNING. We would ride every ride together, eat together, and shared many memories I'm still fond of. My favorite was when we rode the haunted mansion, she grabbed my arm during the scary beginning and then insisted I ride with her on the ride itself. 

After that trip, we were far closer and were texting all the time. I realized how much I liked her (and how much she liked me) when we went to a local festival and essentially cuddled on a blanket for over an hour and just appreciated each others company. I was heartbroken when she had to leave at the end of the year and stayed in touch. Only about a week later I decided that I couldn't shake my feelings and asked if she would want something serious (despite the obvious difficulties that come with that kind of a long-distance relationship). To my utter shock, she told me that she had felt the same way and wanted to give us a shot. This was my first ever relationship and I had started at max difficulty as I didn't see her in person again for another year.

Now, despite the distance, we talked constantly. Every day we were constantly talking, sharing, and connecting more than I had ever thought possible with the constraints. Over the course of our relationship, she was able to come back to the states to celebrate Christmas with my family, and even my sister's wedding (both 1.5-2 weeks long). I'm not ashamed to admit that I was obsessed with her. I would've done anything for her and loved her more than the world. So when she suggested I come to visit her and her family in Italy, the idea was exciting. 

Now I have to preface the rest of this story by explaining some personal issues I have. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder and have struggled with them for years. I don't say this for sympathy because I understand they are my issues and my issues alone. In fact, my ex was incredibly supportive and helped talk me through countless panic attacks or cheer me up when I felt worthless. In turn, I was always there when she was having anxiety in her life and felt honored she trusted me to, in her words, be ""her person.""

So, I worked my butt off over the summer and saved up $1700 to buy a plane ticket to Italy. I had never flown on a plane by myself, let alone an international flight, so needless to say I was very nervous about the whole ordeal. But If she was willing to do it for me twice, I was more than willing to suck it up and do it for her. 

When I made it, she greeted me and gave me a massive hug before her parents drove us all back to their place. I was supposed to stay for 3 weeks with the last two days being a trip to Rome with just the two of us as she goes to college there. Now I will say that in retrospect, she was being slightly weird for the time I was there. She seemed less interested in spending time with me and didn't seem to care about how I felt when I brought it up. I remember one day she wanted to go to the beach (the same thing we had did the last 4 days) while it was 101 degrees out. I told her that I didn't think I was up for it and her only response was, ""ok, well I'm going anyway."" She then got ready and left me alone in her room for the next 4 hours. Another time, we were going to late-night soccer game that her friends were at and while we were leaving the car I was humming what was on the radio. In a cold tone she just said ""don't do that."" I thought she was joking for a minute because I am constantly humming or singing (not in an embarrassing or obnoxious way), but she looked at me like she was embarrassed by me.

About a week and a half into the trip, I was feeling upset about everything told her that I wanted to spend time with her. I was waiting in her room so we could talk about things. I waited. And I waited. For 3 hours until like 1:30 in the morning. I had to go to the bathroom at some point and left her room to see her down the hall in her parents room, just sitting there on her phone. I know it sounds clingy, but I had spend $1700 to come and spend time with her and it felt like she didn't want me there. After peeing quick, I went back into her room. Now, her room has a terrace on it with doors that are nearly always open due to the heat. When I went to close the door, the wind from outside caught it and shut it more forcefully than I had intended. Not a crashing slam, just a solid thunk. I immediately hear footsteps coming down the hall and the door comes flying open with my ex standing there. She immediately starts laying into me saying how people are trying to sleep and ""what is wrong with you?"" I tried to explained what had happened but she just kept saying ""I don't care."" At this point, I was properly pissed as she wasn't even willing to listen to me over such a stupid thing. I told her how upset I was that she didn't seem to want to be around me and all she said, repeatedly, was ""I don't care, I do what I want.""

At this point, I was just done and realized we weren't going to get anywhere with this conversation and I just said that I was going to sleep on the couch for the night. I grabbed the blanket and pillow I had been using the entire week and took them into the living room. She follows right behind me and as soon as I put them down on the couch, she immediately picks them up and brings them back to her room. This is when I called her a c\*nt. I regret calling her that but I was honestly so pissed and confused by her unnecessary pettiness that it just slipped out of my mouth. She surprisingly had absolutely no reaction and just walked back into her room. I found a blanket and pillow in the living room and went to sleep in a huff.

At 3:30 in the morning, I am woken up by my ex shoving a phone in my face, only saying ""your parents want to talk to you."" I groggily took the phone and said ""Hello?"" The panicked voice of my mother says ""What is going on? Are you okay?"" Confused, I said ""yes... why?"" She says that Jan said I was having a mental breakdown, slamming doors, and was depressed the entire trip (all three complete bs). I was honestly so groggy from just waking up that I couldn't comprehend what was being told to me. She said that Jan told them that her parents don't feel safe with me in their house and that I need to leave immediately. Now, her Dad speaks zero English, and her mom only knows very basic phrases so I have NO idea what Jan had told them. Regardless, I was told to pack my things and her Dad would drive me to the airport. 

I packed my suitcase in a confused, crushed daze as my ex coldly and emotionlessly shoved my belongings into my bag, refusing to even look at me. Her father and brother took me to the airport (apparently she didn't have the spine to come with) and walked with me until I got to security where they promptly left. I had no idea what I did wrong and spent the 2 hours waiting for my first flight crying uncontrollably in the waiting area getting strange looks from strangers. 

When I made it home, she told me that she had fallen out of love with me and then tried to gaslight me saying ""we didn't kick you out."" I don't know what other way there is to describe telling someone they're no longer welcome and need to leave immediately other than kicking them out. I was just at this point pissed and blocked her on everything. My parents, never believing the bs story were fully supportive and on my side saying that I dodged a bullet. I just don't know what went wrong. What I did to deserve criminal treatment. I could've respected falling out of love with someone, but the way she went about it is just insane.

as I work night shifts, I need to stay awake through the night. I've tried all sorts of stuff. Coffee, caffeine pills, matcha, even kratom. Nothing worked to keep me awake and I would always return to quite high caffeine (150-180mg per dose) energy drinks. But they aren't particularly healthy and their prolonged use has led to heart palpitations. I've lately had some good sleep, so currently I'm running on green tea. But it's only a matter of time before I need something stronger. So I looked into yerba maté, since I've heard stories about how it replaced coffee for some people.

I've done a bit of preliminary research. I need high caffeine content, so uruguayan maté would be the choice. I've heard it's not for beginners, but while I'm a beginner in yerba, I can handle both caffeine and bitter taste. My preliminary decision was Canarias. But would there be better suited alternatives? And if Canarias, which one? Most reviews online are in Spanish, which I don't speak. And while I know Canarias special edition is aged 6 months longer than standard edition, I can't really find what practical difference it makes.",3,1743995368.0,yerbamate,3,1.0,False

I have most of the ingredients, and plan to attempt a reverse engineer.  Would love any tips or ideas!

More on the Green Lady:  the regular encouraged me to give the bartender a flavor profile and base spirit, and she'd create something. I was in the mood for a spirit-forward ""dessert"" cocktail, so I requested Cantina Negra coffee liqueur and rum.  She went to work in her lab - created one that was too coffee forward, second one she tested and dumped, and the third was a winner.  Great experience, can't wait to go back.

I only found out because we were visiting his aunt and sleeping in a smaller bed than usual. I went down for coffee in the morning, he came down shortly after and had a black eye. I asked “what the fuck is that” he casually said it was from work and not to worry about it and tried to change the subject (he works on large diesel engines and gets busted up often but hadn’t been to work in 4 days). I called bullshit, and asked what happened. That’s when he told me that I get a little violent in my sleep but it’s not a big deal, and not to worry about it. 

I was shocked and felt awful that I had done that to him. He said I punch, kick, bite, shove, and scratch him while I’m asleep. He said I’ve always done it and he never told me because he said he can handle it. I’m 5 foot, boyfriend is built, just over 6 feet and my hand is the size of his palm. He said I’m just really reactive when I’m asleep. 

When we first started going out he said he’d grab my arms and try to talk to me, but then I’d bite and kick and thrash so he has learned to block or dodge instead until I calm down. If he has to get up to use the bathroom he said he has to be careful not to make too much movement in the bed or I’ll go after him. 

He has told me that I talk in my sleep, and that sometimes I will just wake up and take all my clothes off. 

I got us a bigger bed, and put it in the corner of the room so I can sleep against the wall. 
I offered to sleep in a different room of our house, he said he doesn’t want that and it doesn’t happen EVERY night. He was very calm about that whole thing and acted like it wasn’t a big deal. 

I talked to my parents about it and they told me there’s a family history of it on both sides. My grandma (dads mom) would fight my grandpa while she was sleep walking, she’d cut up towels and clothes into a million pieces, throw shit etc. and was just really violent to anyone she encountered while asleep. 

My grandpa (mom’s dad) would scream, yell and curse in his sleep, and he would get up and eat. My mom said she’d wake up in the morning to find the fridge open and that you could follow the trail of food to my grandpas bedroom. 

I feel terrible, I started seeing a therapist, have tried weighted blankets, and putting a pillow between us. My boyfriend seems to think it’s amusing and tells me not to worry about it. I don’t think my boyfriend tells me every time it happens. I worry every night before bed and when I see marks on him I always wonder if they’re really from work.

This happened to me.

I was 27, sitting in a glass-walled conference room, nodding through another Monday morning meeting where I barely spoke. My ideas were good—I knew that—but I always held back.
Not because I lacked confidence. But because I knew, deep down, I was different. The only gay guy on the team. No one was hostile. No one was kind, either. Just polite distance. Micro-judgments. A subtle glass ceiling.

Then one day, I saw a resume come across our desk. Same role I had once applied for.
His LinkedIn photo had a little Pride frame. His email signature had pronouns. And I remembered what it was like—sending out application after application, hoping for just one person to see you for who you are and what you bring.

So I did something small. I nudged the hiring manager. “Hey, this guy looks interesting—let’s talk to him.”
He got the interview.
Then he got the job.
Now, a year later, we grab coffee and talk strategy. He thrives. He’s out. He’s confident. He’s leading Pride ERG events. He’s what I wished I had back then.

And I realized… this isn’t just about hiring.
It’s about healing.

So here’s my message to every gay professional scrolling through Reddit right now, disheartened by rejection emails and ghosted applications:

You are not alone in this job market.

We are everywhere—in the HR departments, in the hiring panels, in the teams you want to join.
And we remember what it felt like to be overlooked, underpaid, and unseen.

That’s why this community exists.
To give you the backdoor, the boost, and the brotherhood that the corporate world never offered us.

Drop your LinkedIn. Or a generic message not revealing your details if some texts someone texts Post your role. Offer a referral. Ask for help.
Let’s build a gay pipeline so strong that no one has to walk alone ever again.

We’re not just working our way up anymore.
We’re pulling others up with us.

I wasn’t even going to post until this morning but I’m curious about your thoughts, so here goes.

I’ve been trying to get a promotion, putting in some extra effort with one of our clients. The meeting ran way too long, the kind where you’re nodding politely through your sixth round of revisions on a PowerPoint slide for the appendix that no one will ever read. I was fried, suit still on, tie half-loosened, and walking to the subway stop on 42^(nd) Street.

I remember hating that it was already humid in April. Sticky shirt, damp collar, basically perfect subway weather.

The train was maybe a third full. Everyone had that glazed, dead-eyed late-night look. There was a guy with a construction vest sleeping upright. Two teens with headphones sharing a phone screen. A woman doing the crossword in pen. Normal.

A candy woman walked by. You know the type “Got candy, got snacks, two for a dollar, cash or CashApp.” She had a small plastic tote, crinkling as she moved down the aisle. Nobody bought anything, but she made it to the next car and kept going. Her voice faded. Just the sound of wheels on track, the low hum of the semi-working AC.

The lights overhead blinked once, just a surge, and suddenly everything went black and white. Not dark. Just… colorless. The teens. The crossword woman. The ad posters. Even the orange seats were just gray. The whole world, drained of color.

Except me. I looked down at my hands, my pants, my socks. Still in color, slightly shaking.

No one else reacted. That’s what really got me. They just sat there, perfectly still, eyes glassy. No confusion. No movement. Just... grayscale passengers in a world that had stopped caring about color.

It took a few seconds before I realized that it wasn’t visual. The train kept moving, but everything inside it stopped. The hum? Gone. The clatter of the tracks? Gone. I clapped my hands once. Nothing. Tried to speak, no voice. I couldn’t even hear my own heartbeat.

It was like someone hit mute on the universe.

That’s when I noticed the sconce. Yes, a literal wall sconce, like something out of an old mansion, attached near the connecting door. It hadn’t been there before. Wrought iron, twisted into an impossible knot, the flickering flame was the only color in the car, the orange flame bent sideways, but it didn’t cast any light. The glow stayed trapped in the glass.

Right next to it was a brass handle, not a rail, but a handle, like you’d use to pull open a hidden panel. It gleamed faintly, even in the absence of light.

I stood up. Don’t ask me why. I just felt like I had to see more. And I did.

I looked out the window. Not the tunnel walls I expected. Not graffiti or pipes or dust.

Outside, the tunnels stretched upward and sideways, hundreds of them intersecting like water pipes. Inside some, I saw people frozen in grayscale.

Below us, buildings that reminded me of the Gothic cathedrals in Europe. More sconces lined the outside too, hundreds of them, spaced unevenly, some upside down, some floating inches off the wall. They all burned that same pale flame that didn't touch the walls.

I was captivated, staring at the scenery with utter fascination.

That’s when the fear hit me. Sweat dripped into my eyes, and I moved to wipe it away. And as soon as I blinked…

Color.

Sound.

Movement.

I felt a jolt of normalcy like cold water to the face. The train jerked slightly. The lights buzzed. The crossword lady flipped a page.

It was like nothing happened.

I got off two stops later. Walked home in a daze. Told myself it was exhaustion. Maybe something in the air. Dehydration. Or just too much work.

The next morning, Wednesday, I booted up. Coffee in hand, half-asleep, just trying to get through the day.

Before anything loaded, the CMD prompt popped up.  
Not one I opened, not one I could close. It typed two lines:

*C:\\Users\\¤̸̳̓§⟁∆...*  

*Z:\\Users\\> Welcome Back, Commander*

It blinked twice and vanished.  
Surely it wasn’t meant for me. I’ve never been in the military.

Now I’m just… here. Writing this. Wondering if I should ignore it or if someone else has seen something like this. The sconces. The silence. The frozen people.  
Or maybe I really do need to lay off the late-night PowerPoint.

Only took me 1.5 days to do it... Like I said, never done one and I work on commercial coffee equipment for my job. I'm just stubborn and tenacious. Thanks Dad for teaching me anything can be fixed, just depends on how much you want to save.

The tricky part for me was getting the A/C compressor turned 90° vertical (belt whewlnpointong down) and over by the oil filter. I should have done that after took it off before loosening the alternator. (Face palm) Once that was done the alternator came right out and went right back together like butter.

It was fun figuring out the best way to get to connectors and bolts. Gotta love all the wire clips, metal clamps and random sharp edges... just like commercial coffee equipment. 🙃

Getting access via the front passenger wheel well was a first as well. Lifting the engine 1.5"" to remove a bolt on the alternator was a nice solution - thanks design engineers. 🫤 (Again see comment about similarities to coffee equipment 😐

I will be visiting Sydney for a couple of nights 28th & 29th April!



As the title says, I'm non-binary (assigned male at birth). This is a fairly recent discovery and I'm making slow changes in my life to be a little more andro/fem leaning in my appearance. I'm super interested in meeting people who might be eager to help me explore my femininity further, platonically and/or sexually.



I'm interested in technology, cooking, music, video games, and an array of other nerdy activities. I'm a big foodie, and very much love the experience of new things with someone fun. I'm the type of person who feeds off of others energy and excitement, so please share your passions with me!



Ideally, I'm hoping to find someone who is interested in a range of activities like the above, but to begin with I'm open to discussion about anything from coffee, clothes shopping, a movie, hooking up, whatever! I just want to find someone who I can express more of my authentic self around to build confidence, and a shared interest to see how far we can take it.

1jtb3ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeScare/comments/1jtb3ee/the_office_phone_rang_after_closing_no_one_should/,The Office Phone Rang After Closing. No One Should Have Had That Number.,"It was just after 11 PM when the store officially closed. Customers had been cleared out, lights were dimmed across most of the aisles, and the floor crew had clocked out for the night. Only two of us were left inside. Me and one of the newer employees, Daniel. We were upstairs in the office, finishing up the weekly financials. Payroll reports, safe counts, the usual end-of-week paperwork that always took longer than it should.

Our office was tucked above the floor on the second level of the supermarket. It wasn’t fancy. Just a windowed room with metal cabinets, two desks, an old rolling chair, and one security monitor hooked into the main camera system. From up there, you could see about half the store floor. Aisles 1 through 7, plus the front registers, customer service, and part of the bakery. The rest of the store stretched into blind corners, blocked by beams and signage. The stairs to our office were inside a locked staff hallway that ran along the back wall, behind the dairy section.

It was quiet, the kind of stillness that only really settles in when a building meant to be loud finally goes silent. The air felt heavier than usual. Even the hum of the freezers downstairs seemed duller, like the whole building was holding its breath. We had music playing low from one of our phones, just to fill the space.

Daniel was at the desk across from me, sipping his second gas station coffee. I was double-checking register summaries for the day, just trying to get through the last stretch. We were both tired, but too close to being done to call it a night.

Then the manager phone rang.

Not one of the aisle phones. Not a line from the service desk. It was the direct line to the upstairs office. The internal extension. The only people who ever called it were corporate, loss prevention, or sometimes other store managers during shift changes.

We both froze. Daniel looked over at me, then slowly reached for the phone.

He picked it up and said, ""Hello? This is Daniel.""

No answer. He waited a few seconds. Still nothing.

He hung up and looked at me with a tight shrug. We both kind of brushed it off, figuring maybe someone misdialed.

About three minutes later, it rang again.

Same line. Same extension. Daniel picked it up again.

""Hello?""

Still nothing. But this time, I could hear something faint. I was sitting close enough to the receiver to catch it.

It sounded like breathing. Really quiet, almost like the person was trying not to be heard. Daniel said hello again, voice a little louder, then hung up.

We both sat there, completely still.

The third call came in not long after. Same thing. Office line. Daniel answered again, but this time we both leaned in.

At first, it was silent. Then came the sound. Not breathing now, but something else.

It was muffled. Almost distant. Like someone screaming far away with their mouth covered. The kind of sound that you recognize as a person, but not enough to understand what they’re saying.

Daniel slammed the phone down.

We immediately went to the security feed and started switching through the cameras. Nothing was moving. No one was in the aisles. The doors were locked. No cars outside. The monitors showed a perfectly still supermarket, half-lit and quiet.

""That line isn’t public,"" Daniel said quietly.

It was true. The internal manager line couldn’t be accessed without knowing the direct extension and how to route through the store system. There’s no way some prank caller could guess it. And besides, the store was closed. The only two people inside were both sitting in the same office.

We tried to shake it off. Told ourselves maybe it was a glitch. Or maybe someone from another store accidentally dialed in. Even though we both knew it didn’t sound like that.

That’s when my personal phone started ringing.

I looked down. It was a number I didn’t recognize. Area code from two states over.

""You getting a call right now?"" I asked.

Daniel looked down. His screen lit up with a different unknown number. Completely different area code.

We didn’t answer.

We let both calls go to voicemail, but no message was left.

Ten minutes passed. Nothing happened. We went back to finishing our reports, trying to laugh it off. Told ourselves it was probably a phone scam or spam system that hit us at the same time. Weird timing, but not impossible.

Then I got a text.

No message. Just a photo.

It was taken from the store floor, angled up through the window that looked into our office.

The picture showed me and Daniel, sitting at our desks. Working.

""Daniel,"" I said. I turned my phone around.

His face went pale.

""That had to be old,"" he said. But the timestamp on the message said it had been sent thirty seconds ago.

We ran to the window and looked down.

There was no one.

No footsteps. No shadows. No phone light. Nothing. Just shelves, pallet stacks, and the faint reflection of our own office window. The air outside the glass looked heavy, almost blurry. Like the air itself didn’t want to be still anymore.

Then the office phone rang again.

We didn’t answer.

We jumped out of our chairs, grabbing everything without even thinking. I stuffed the paperwork into my backpack, Daniel yanked the USB drive from the register report printer, and we didn’t even turn the lights off. We flung open the office door and took the stairs two at a time.

The hallway on the lower level felt way longer than it normally did. Our footsteps were the only sound, sharp and fast against the tile. We turned the corner, passed the dark dairy cooler, and reached the alarm box. I punched in the override code with fingers that felt stiff and clumsy.

The beeping stopped. We pushed the front door open hard enough to rattle it.

The outside felt too wide. The cold night air hit like a wave. The parking lot was still. The floodlights flickered slightly, casting long shadows from the shopping cart corral. Everything looked the same, but it didn’t feel the same. The place had shifted. Not visibly, but underneath.

We didn’t talk. We didn’t look back. We got into Daniel’s car like we were being chased, and the second the doors were shut, he started the engine and tore out of there without hesitation.

We didn’t even speak until we were halfway down the road. The silence in the car was thick, broken only by the hum of the tires on the road and the occasional tap of the blinker.

My phone buzzed again.

Same area code. Different number.

Welp it was a good run but.... im tired so very tired.

I was fortunate to gain manager experience through being a shift, meet cool people, make good memories, meet my fiancee and become black apron certified but the bad outward the good EVERYTIME!!!

I am done being abused by management  and being told that customers have every right to treat us like 💩💩💩.

I was forced to work sick and that was my last straw... it should have been my last straw when.

1) my fiancee didn't get paid mileage when we moved towns and he had to drive a total of 2 hours to help our old store who held him there 2 months after his transfer was set because  they needed a shift advisor.

2) when I was written up for trying to report my manager to my district manager for the mistreatment I was getting from them.

3) when I had a cigarette thrown at me by a customer and I was told that I was overreacting 

4) When my fiancee was told to keep his store open even though his stores ice machine caught on fire

5) when I tried to promote to uppermanagment 3 times and was told I was missing something (THAT WE DONT LEARN UNLESS WE ARE MANAGERS) each time and they hire externally 

6) When my store had 4 different managers leave our store at the same time of me trying to promote.

7) having to do my managers job.

8) BULLYING

And so so much more...... (decreasing my pay as a shift because I transferred stores)

This company  lost everything it stood for and it's sad to see.... they expect the impossible from people... time to go to a coffee shop that values me as a partner and get paid for my work properly.

Bella (21 F) is the glue to our whole group. The two of us met on our dorm floor freshman year and overtime, Bella made a few friends who I befriended through her. We've always been pretty different with me being a homebody while she always went out on weekends. Since she has a summer birthday, she hasn't been able to go to clubs until this school year. Her and the group have gone out a lot while I always stayed in, even before they started clubbing. I would just hang out with them during the day or host potlucks from time to time. 

With this being my last semester before student teaching, I've been super busy so we haven't even been able to hang out as much. Because of this, we planned one night where they would come over to my place, get baked, do some baking, and watch horrible movies, and then another night I go out to a club with them. That way we all can do stuff together that we all can enjoy. 

We had planned to go out a few weeks ago, but I had to bail the day before because my family's dog was hit by a car and I wanted to be with him in case those were his final moments (he is okay and recovering now). So we rescheduled for the other night. 

Earlier in the morning though, I was in the ceramics studio working on my final when I cut my hand with a rusty tool. I don't know how but it was a really bad cut and I needed a few stitches plus a tetanus shot. It was only two stitches but I still made the decision to cancel again. I was worried about my hand getting hurt because I know the clubs around here are always so packed and I didn't need people accidentally bumping into it while it was still sore. If the stitches weren't so new, I would have gone, I swear. 

I apologized to Bella and offered for us to go next week, and I hoped that she would understand but instead she left me on read for an hour before sending me a lengthy text about how upset she is that I had bailed again. She expressed her frustration that I never went out with her and the group, and that the most we ever did nowadays was study and get coffee. Despite these two times being the only times I ever bailed, it hurt because this was supposed to be our big hangout. Her and the rest of the group all thought that my injury shouldn't have been a problem, and that they could've accommodated me. They think I am being a jerk because I've bailed two times now. I feel bad, I really do. But none of these were in my control. It's not like I bailed because I just didn't want to go.",1,1743993198.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.67,False

I thought to myself, ""why not just dye the entire shirt in red wine, and give it a good wash? If everything is a stain, nothing is a stain. I'll just use that shirt as my red wine shirt from now on."" The shirt just has a uniform pinkish purple color to it now.

To be clear, the shirt would have to be thoroughly washed after being dyed. Just get the cheapest, reddest wine (or use coffee or whatever) you can find, and soak the whole shirt in it, then give it a good wash.

1jtapzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1jtapzn/not_too_sweet_recipe_recommendations/,Not too sweet recipe recommendations,"I just ordered my Creami and can’t wait for it to show up!

I’m looking for recipes that are not super sweet. I love ice cream, froyo, and gelato but store bought ones tend to be really sweet, especially if they have mix ins like caramel or toffee. To get a sense of my tastes — when I eat Oreos, I eat the cookie and throw away the cream. I’m not looking to replace sugar calories with low calorie sweeteners — I actually just want a frozen dessert that doesn’t taste as sweet and is still creamy and delicious. The problem with churning desserts like this in a traditional churn is it gets very icy without the sugar. 

The kinds of commercial or artisanal ice cream flavors I like are very dark bitter chocolate, nut flavors like almonds/hazelnut/pistachio, coffee, mascarpone, or tart frozen yogurt. Mostly I like the aromatics but I think I like these flavors because they aren’t overpoweringly sweet. I find most protein shakes and protein powders too sweet as well — my favorite meal replacement shake is original Soylent, which tastes kind of like a very lightly sweetened soymilk. I also eat a lot of plain whole milk (or even 10% fat) Greek yogurt with fruit and no added sweetener, and I used to just blend those together with half a banana and ice before my nutribullet died, and that’s why I bought the Creami.

Can anyone recommend some starter recipes for my full fat, not super sweet tastes?
