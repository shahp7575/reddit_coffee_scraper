Hi everyone! Quick update in case it helps someone.
I’ve been on KIT 1 for 1 month and 10 days and I’m down almost 9 lbs.
Side effects:
The first weeks were rough, nausea, headaches, dizziness, burping, and food noise jumping up and down. Taking meds without food or with coffee made everything worse.
But around week 5–6 everything finally calmed down:
almost no nausea,
no headaches,
burping is gone 🙌

dizziness only for a second sometimes,

food noise quiet, appetite normal.

Coffee doesn’t sit well anymore,can’t even finish a cup.
Food stuff:
I feel hunger but get full fast.
 No mindless snacking, no sugar cravings, sweets just sit untouched.
 I often don’t finish my portions and it feels natural.
Overall:
I finally feel good on it. Side effects faded, appetite is under control, and the whole thing feels stable now.
Hope this helps someone in the early rough phase,it can get better! 💛

I thought I was over it, but I just saw on Instagram that he already has a new girlfriend and it broke me in a way I didn’t expect.

When we first met, he had nothing. He had quit his job, was unemployed, and later didn’t even have money for school. Out of love, I paid his tuition with the savings from my part-time job. That was a huge deal for me, but he ended up dropping out and never paid me back. I also gave him money for dental work, paid for most of our dates, and planned everything because he never really took initiative.

About a year in, I caught him messaging other girls. I was devastated but gave him another chance… then another. He cheated on me multiple times — whether it was dating apps, flirty texts, or late night messages from random women. I really tried making it work with him, but he just kept disappointing me and abusing my trust.

Despite all of that, I kept trying to support him. I let him use my car for his driving test (he scratched it, and the mark is still there). I helped him with his résumé, which he copied directly from mine and even lied on. He finally got a job once, but got let go in less than 3 months. Even when he was working, he never tried to pay me back. Instead, he lived off government money, and when that ran out, he’d lash out at me.

I broke up with him once before but went back when he called. That became our cycle. And even when things were “good,” he never gave me anything back. I spent thousands on hotels, food, concerts, and birthdays. He never got me a birthday gift. Meanwhile, I was taking him to steak dinners and booking nice hotel rooms for his.

Last year, I got pregnant. He promised he’d work two jobs if I kept the baby, but I knew he couldn’t provide. I made the painful decision to have an abortion. It broke me, but I knew bringing a child into that situation would’ve destroyed me and he wouldn’t be able to support me at all. I know I’d feel financially stressed.

This past December, I found out he was still cheating and in January he was on a dating app, and that was the final straw. I ended it in February. For months he blew up my phone and email with long, emotional apologies saying I was the love of his life. But after so many betrayals, I couldn’t take him seriously. In June, I sent my last email where I told him he was dead to me, and then I blocked him everywhere. He also sent me another email late June saying that if the tables have turned, he would be open to talking to me and pretty much talked a lot shit about me. He also sent me one last email he saying good luck with sleeping with countless men until I find my person and pretty much talked about alot shit.

In September, I stalked his Instagram. He’s already in a new relationship, posting happy date pictures. And it crushed me. Instead of working on himself, fixing his life, or even taking time to reflect, or improving himself to prove to me that he’s worthy of me..he just jumped into something new.

When I left him, I felt free,  like a huge weight off my chest. I focused on myself, my hobbies, and my career. I thought I was doing well. But seeing him move on so quickly has reopened everything I tried to bury.

He still owes me about $4,000. I’ll probably never get back. I gave him years of my life, my savings, and my love and all I got in return was heartbreak. His family even told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, and maybe I was. But he definitely wasn’t the best thing for me.

I know he doesn’t deserve me, but it still hurts. I hate that I miss him sometimes, after everything he put me through.

Recently, I made a video to expresses my feelings and pretty much told him my side of the story and it was around 30 mins. I emailed it to him which he watched and he ended up emailing me back. If you want to see it, you can dm me. Tbh, his response isn’t very sincere and asked to meet for coffee. As much as I want to say yes, I declined him.

It was his birthday recently and I wished him happy birthday. I know I shouldn’t but couldn’t help it. I still love and miss him and I hate that I do. I wish I can feel nothing about him but that’s not the case.",1,1765513308.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1pkineh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1pkineh/losing_my_mind_from_67pm/,Losing my mind from 6-7pm,"This isn’t the usual ‘mental load’ post. I’ve been there and I’ve had that problem, too. But this is something different and I’m hoping someone has some good ideas for me.

Basically most nights between the hours of at least 6PM-7PM but sometimes 5:30PM to 7:30 PM, I just basically get extremely irritated and short with my 6yo kid. I’m very affectionate and loving the rest of the day, pretty chill and don’t freak out too much (I mean at least it’s not too noticeable). He’s a happy kid, very energetic, talks a lot, can make a lot of noise but he’s generally extremely agreeable and also very good. Strong willed, but not naughty.

I used to think it was the dinner/mental load thing, but tonight I had dinner all taken care of and honestly my kid was being…fine. Just playing. And I was just so overly annoyed with him, so irritated, so desperate to get him to bed. Every second he dragged his feet (taking too long to do something, taking a while and playing/dancing before he gets in the shower, forgetting he had to come back in the bathroom and brush his teeth..) I was just like, vibrating with anger. I snapped at him and just kept telling him to stop talking and do what he was supposed to do. It’s like a combination of rage and hopelessness. 

I feel like (? Maybe?) it has something to do with my body fearing how bed time is going to go (he drags it out, but sometimes he’s okay). Or if there’s something in his mood/demeanor that tells me “tonight is going to be a long one”, like as in maybe he will take forever to go to bed. Often as we cruise into bedtime, my behavior/feelings will get better, and we can end on a nice note, which is why I say the cycle usually ends at 7. If he will settle nicely and read a story with me, I am happy. If he is bouncing off the walls, good chance I am EXTREMELY irritated. 

I find it happens to me way less when I am solo parenting (husband working late, etc). Which seems weird.

I don’t feel like I objectively have that much for mental load. He is my only child, my husband is generally helpful and supportive, I work part time and have time off, and my son doesn’t come home until 4:30pm. Between 4:30-6 (usually) i’m able to be a really good mother, we do homework together and play and everything is fine. Mornings are fine as well, and lots (but not all) weekend days. I do frequently have this feeling on Saturdays too.

I just can’t tell what’s happening at that time almost daily. I don’t take any medications that could be wearing off. I drink morning coffee but not even every day. I love my son so much and I hate the feeling of him finally falling asleep, and me thinking “I really didn’t get to enjoy bedtime,” or “I shouldn’t have said that to him” or “he was just playing and being a kid”. 

Has anyone experienced this? Am I just a snowflake and he’s a normal happy boy? ",2,1765513299.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

Our mutual friend told me that he was asking her if I was single, which made me more confident about reaching out to him outside of group hangouts. About two weeks after he had a performance in the town where I live, so I went to see him there. Naturally, we started talking after his performance and everything was going well. I noticed that he was very touchy with all the girls (this will be important later). Nothing suggestive or sexual, just lots of physical contact. That same night he texted me, asking if I wanted to go for a coffee with him, which I happily agreed to. 

Now, this is where it gets confusing. We went for coffee, walked around the area, and even ended up at a pub later on. The conversation was flowing, we were laughing all the time, LOTS of physical contact and staring into each other’s eyeballs. It went great for me, and I think I like him quite a bit.
On my way home I sent him a “I had a good time” text. And….*drumroll*…he didn’t reply until the next evening . This made me think that I misinterpreted his friendliness and touchiness (like he did to other girls) as something more. We haven’t texted since. 

So my questions are: Should I initiate another hangout, and if all goes well be more blunt about how I feel towards him? Will that put him off, since there is no “chase”? Was that coffee hangout really just friendly?

Recently my colleagues have been showing me faces & talking down on me which rly makes me feel like shit. They talk in Malay and probably think that I don’t understand, I don’t. But I understand some words. They called me “cacat” & “Rabak” as well as saying “ so slow, no reaction, don’t know why she here “ and “ just tell her stand one side “. I felt awful like I’m still learning & trying my best (I only have shifts on weekends as I’m a student) it makes it harder each time to go for my next upcoming shift knowing things will just continue. Im okay with people scolding me for doing things wrongly, that’s understandable but talking down on me made me feel demoralised and don’t even wna go work.

I’ve recently applied to chagee, not sure if it’s a good choice given that chagee is rly popular and always preparing 100 cups & given that I’m a slow learner.

Ive also messaged my store manager asking if it’s possible to transfer stores, she didn’t reply me but did text in the gc abt work stuff so idk what to do.. Im only considering working chagee because I do love drinking chagee & know their menu quite well whereas for the coffee chain I’m currently working at, I don’t drink much hence don’t really know the menu well & all maybe that’s why I’m struggling ?What do i do ? Do I follow up with my store manager about transferring ? Do I stay in my current outlet ? Do I just drop this and move on with chagee ?
Part of me don’t rly want to drop this bc I’ve alrd learnt a few stuff & job scope is generally quite fun like just making coffee etc. I think is just the people there ? + I have upcoming shifts tmr and day after 😭

1pkihdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1pkihdz/this_four_wheel_electric_bike_saved_my_dads/,This four wheel electric bike saved my dad’s independence,"My dad is 76 and stubborn as hell. When he failed his driver’s test renewal last year, I thought he’d be devastated. Turns out, I was more devastated than he was  but for different reasons.

He refused to ask for rides. Refused senior transportation services. Refused everything. He’d rather sit home isolated than “be a burden.” Watching him fade into loneliness was killing me.

I started researching alternatives. Regular bikes were too unstable for him. Mobility scooters felt too old (his words). Then I discovered four wheel electric bikes they’re stable like a scooter but look sporty like a bike.

I found several models through various suppliers, including options on Alibaba, and chose one with good reviews, comfortable seating, and reliable battery life. Had it shipped to my house first so I could test it and make sure it was safe.

When I brought it to his place, he was skeptical. Then annoyed. Then I asked him to just try it once.

He rode around his neighborhood for two hours.

Now, three months later, he rides that thing everywhere. Grocery store, library, coffee shop, even to volunteer at the community garden. His entire demeanor has changed. He’s social again, active, HAPPY.

Last week, he called me just to chat something he rarely did before. He told me about his day, the people he’d seen, places he’d been. We talked for an hour.

This electric bike didn’t just give him transportation. It gave him back his life, and it gave me back my dad. Sometimes the best solutions come in unexpected packages.

Majority of the time I initiate going out/going on dates, getting me flowers, planning vacations, etc. In the last 2 years I’ve been verbal about how disappointed I am that I’m always planning everything but he would always say stuff like “I plan it too.” Or “I get you flowers” but it’s always a once in a blue type of stuff. I’ve always been verbal about loving getting flowers even before our relationship. Whenever I bring it up he’d always sulk and say he’s not enough and he’s doing everything he can yet he still feels inadequate. I always end up apologizing because I know he is trying and I know he’s gone a long way from before but to me it just doesn’t feel enough. I feel so under appreciated. I’ve done so much in our relationship that I’m starting to grow tired. 

I wanted to go do something special for our anniversary. We went to an expensive restaurant— it was our 3rd year anniversary so we both agreed. I wanted us to do something special since we don’t normally spend a lot of money and when we do go out I mostly pay so he doesn’t complain about going out all the time when we’re free and spending all this money. Little BG, he’s always working and is only free on the weekends. I sometimes work on the weekends so when I get the chance (not often now maybe once or twice in a month with intervals) I ask him to go out on a date.

Going back, we were on that anniversary date . I remembered the bill racking up to $300+ for the two of us. The waiter came and ask my boyfriend if he’d like the check and he said yes. He takes the bill from the waiter and sets it down near me and just looks at me. 

I didn’t mind paying for it but the fact that he just expected me to pay kind of rubbed me the wrong way. We both agreed to come here but I ended up shrugging it off, thinking “lets finish eating first maybe he’ll get it” and so when the waiter came back he looked at my boyfriend expecting he’s going to pay and then my boyfriend just gave me another look. The waiter left I guess sensing smth and so I gave in and gave my boyfriend my card and he paid with it. It bugged me a little but I love the man and I worked a bunch of overtime anyway so I had the money. 

Now our anniversary is creeping up again( Dec 18). He’s supposed to plan our vacation together for our anniversary. He’s had more than a month to plan it. I voiced that I wanted to go snowboarding as we both met from snowboarding. I asked him last weekend if he’d book anything. He said not yet. Might I add I’ve asked him multiple times just to check in (in the course of a month and a half) He’d always say not yet since he’s busy. When there were weekends where he wasn’t busy and he’s just playing games. Sometimes he’d say things like he’s bored and just wants to be lazy. Now he’s asking me where to go and he’s having a hard time booking anything as everything’s so expensive now. 

I just feel so under appreciated and I’m starting to lose faith in our relationship. I don’t mind paying for stuff since I earn a little more than him. Dont get me wrong he pays for stuff too like getting grabbing coffee or snacks, he pays for some of our dinners too. It’s just the effort seem so minimal to me lately. I feel bad for even pointing it out sometimes because he’d always say “I’m really trying my best here. I dont know how else to make you happy.”

The idea is simple: You get swipe cards based on the type of place you want to go. You swipe what you’re in the mood for, your girlfriend does the same, and the app finds the overlaps and recommends the top 3 spots you both might like. Then you both rate your top 3 and the app picks the one you'll go to. 

It has helped me discover a lot of cute coffee shops in Da nang. You can also save places for the future. 

Right now I’m training it on Da Nang café/restaurant data. It’s not a paid app — I’m just building it to learn and would love some honest feedback. 

Also it has a solo mode as well. Works exactly the same, but you directly get recommendations instead of getting matched with anything or having to rate top 3...

He still owes me about $4,000. I’ll probably never get back. I gave him years of my life, my savings, and my love — and all I got in return was heartbreak. His family even told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, and maybe I was. But he definitely wasn’t the best thing for me.

I know he doesn’t deserve me, but it still hurts. I hate that I miss him sometimes, after everything he put me through.

Recently, I made a video to expresses my feelings and pretty much told him my side of the story and it was around 30 mins. I emailed it to him which he watched and he ended up emailing me back. If you want to see it, you can dm me. Tbh, his response isn’t very sincere and asked to meet for coffee. As much as I want to say yes, I declined him.

It was his birthday recently and I wished him happy birthday. I know I shouldn’t but couldn’t help it. I still love and miss him and I hate that I do. I wish I can feel nothing about him but that’s not the case.",1,1765512739.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

1pkigm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pkigm3/im_not_sure_if_this_woman_feels_a_connection_with/,I'm not sure if this woman feels a connection with me or needs a distraction from her current life problems.,"We matched on Hinge a couple of weeks ago, but her profile said to add her on Instagram because she never checks Hinge. Normally I avoid that because it feels like someone just wants followers, but I went for it anyway. Her IG page seemed normal and not influencer-ish, which was a good sign.

We talked for about a week, though she was inconsistent. Then on Sunday she asked me to get coffee.

When we met, we seemed to hit it off, but she came across as very awkward. One of the first things she said was, “I’m only here because you’re funny,” which I thought was odd. She also mentioned she’d just put her cat down, so I understood why she might not have been very responsive.

We ended up hanging out for four hours, walked around town, and I walked her to her apartment lobby. She also mentioned I was only the second date she’d been on all year.

After that, texting stayed pretty minimal and I felt like she wasn’t that interested, but I asked her out again anyway. She responded and even suggested a day and place.

We met up last night and spent six hours together. To be honest, I think she partly wanted to go to the place she suggested because there was a chess tournament and she loves chess. She only played one game and watched a bit, but she spent most of the time talking with me.

During the night she told me she’d been in a bad fender-bender that morning. I was surprised she still showed up, but she said she needed a night to laugh and decompress. This made me start to feel like maybe I was more of a distraction from everything going on in her life, not someone she saw real dating potential with.

At the end of the night, I asked her directly whether she felt a connection, a friendship, or if I was just a distraction. She didn’t really answer the question. Instead, she said she felt cautious because I seemed “too nice or perfect.” I’ve heard that on dates before. I’m definitely not perfect, but I tried to reassure her that I’m a genuine person. I'm a divorced guy with a son in my mid-30s. I am also quiet and emotionally withdrawn when I feel stressed. She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek goodnight, but I still didn't end the night feeling much interest coming from her.

I haven’t heard anything from her today. She only responds if I reach out first.

I know it was only two dates, but we spent a lot of time together on both and had meaningful conversations. I don’t need constant texting, but I do want someone who shows interest outside of the actual dates.

Right now, I’m leaning towards waiting a day and then sending a message saying I had a good time but don’t think we’re compatible and wishing her the best. She didn’t do anything wrong, I just don’t think we’re on the same page, and I don’t want to risk developing deeper feelings if I’m only serving as a temporary distraction for her.

I think someone's been stalking me through it.,"I’m writing this from my phone on the floor of my hallway, with my dog shaking against my leg and someone trying keys in my laundry door.

If this cuts out mid-sentence, that’s probably the moment they get in.

The tapping on the windows stopped a few minutes ago. The doorbell finally went quiet. But whoever’s out there just tried the front door, then the side gate, and now I can hear metal scraping against the lock at the back.

The worst part isn’t that someone’s trying to break in.

The worst part is... they shouldn’t need a key.  
But it sounds like they have one.

And if I’m right about who it is, he’s been inside my house already.  
He’s been inside for weeks.

\* \* \* \* \*

This started at the dog park.

I go to the same one most mornings with my dog, Rocket – big off-leash space with a scrappy little tree line and a strip of woods that looks way creepier than it has any right to in daylight.

The day I met him, it was stupidly normal. Blue sky, coffee in a keep cup, the usual “What breed is he?” small talk from strangers. Rocket was doing his zoomie routine in circles, and I was half on my phone, half pretending to be a functioning adult.

“Is that a camera to watch your dog?”

The voice came from over my shoulder. I turned and this guy was standing there, maybe late thirties, hoodie, beanie, that kind of face you’d forget if it weren’t for the eyes. Too pale. Too still.

He nodded at my phone. On the lock screen I had a little thumbnail from my petcam app. I use it to check on Rocket when I’m out.

“Yeah,” I said. “Helps with the separation anxiety.”

His mouth twitched. “Yours or his?”

I laughed politely, because that’s what you do when strangers are slightly weird. He had a dog with him too, some kelpie mix going absolutely feral on a tennis ball. We did the dog-park intro handshake: names, ages, “he’s usually not this crazy, I swear.”

His name was Liam. Or at least that’s what he said.  
He asked a few too-specific questions.

“So you work from home? You must, right? I always see you here around this time.”

I shrugged it off. “Freelance. Flexible hours.”

He smiled like that confirmed something for him.

We talked for maybe fifteen minutes. It wasn’t awful. A bit intense, but I’ve met worse at that park. Only right at the end did it get… off.

Rocket ran over because he’d heard his “baby voice” tone, and I did what I always do without thinking – I leaned down and scritched his chest in that silly way I always do in the kitchen when no one’s around, saying, “Who’s my little man?”

“Ah,” Liam said. “That thing you do in the kitchen.”

I straightened up. “What?”

He watched me. Too closely. “You always do that in the hallway. Right by the laundry. You say it the same way.”

There was a long, empty silence between us. The park was suddenly very loud with other dogs barking.

“I mean,” he said, way too late to be casual, “I just… assumed. You look like the type.”

What type? The “talks to their dog in the hallway” type?

I forced a laugh because I didn’t know what else to do. “Yeah. I guess.”

But it stuck in my head in that weird way that only wrong things do.

You know when your brain files something under: **THIS IS IMPORTANT, BUT WE DON’T KNOW WHY YET**?

Yeah. That.

\* \* \* \* \*

A few days later I got an email from the petcam company.

**“We’ve detected a login from a new device. If this wasn’t you, we recommend changing your password.”**

The location was listed as another suburb on the other side of town, about twenty minutes away. I told myself it was a glitch. Or one of their servers. Companies screw that stuff up all the time, right?

I clicked through, got to the change-password screen, got distracted by Rocket bringing me a squeaky toy, and thought, *I’ll do it later.*

I didn’t.

That’s the part that keeps repeating in my head now, like a taunt.

You had one job.

\* \* \* \* \*

The first time I thought I saw him again was at the park. I was mid-conversation with another dog owner, laughing about how their pug was bullying a German Shepherd, when something over their shoulder snagged my attention.

In the tree line, just beyond the off-leash boundary, someone was standing half-hidden behind a trunk. Just… standing. Wearing a dark hoodie. Head tilted like he was listening.

I blinked, and the person was gone. Vanished back into the strip of trees.

“You okay?” the other owner asked.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Thought I saw someone I knew.”

I told myself it was nothing. Just some jogger cutting through. Or my brain filling in shapes. I’ve got anxiety; I know my imagination can posture like a heavyweight.

But then it happened again.

I came out of the pet supply shop one afternoon, arms full of overpriced treats, when I saw him across the street, at the mouth of a narrow alley. Same hunched shoulders. Same beanie pulled low.

He didn’t move like surprise, or guilt, or anything normal. He just stepped backwards. Slowly. Like he’d expected me to walk out at that exact moment and was already in reverse.

By the time I could cross the street, he was gone.

“Coincidence,” I muttered to myself the whole walk home. “You’re just spiralling. It’s fine.”

That night, when I checked the petcam app from bed out of habit, the little light on the camera in the living room blinked on.

It does that when you open the app. You see the live view, the light comes on, everything behaves like it should.

Except this time, there was a delay.

The stream went black for a second. Then static. Then my own living room slowly came into focus. The camera’s angle was slightly… off. Too low. Like someone had bumped it.

Rocket lifted his head from his bed and stared directly into the lens. Not in that lazy way dogs do. His ears were pinned, and he let out this soft, warning growl.

I checked the app. No one else was logged in. Just my account.

I told myself the camera had just… glitched. Reset. Something.

I told myself that a lot.

\* \* \* \* \*

The thing with the spare key happened the week after.

I managed to lock myself out taking the rubbish out – door swung shut behind me, classic. No phone, no wallet, just me and the wheelie bin like an idiot.

I keep a spare key for the laundry side door in an old pot near the back fence. I’ve used it a dozen times over the years.

Except this time, when I dug through the dirt, it wasn’t there.

I pulled the whole pot out. Checked the soil, the ground around it, the little crack in the fence where I sometimes jam junk mail. Nothing.

I ended up having to climb in through a window I’d left latched but not locked. Scratched the hell out of myself and scared Rocket half to death.

I told myself I must’ve moved the key and forgotten. People forget things.

Later that night, sitting on the couch, I got a notification:

**“Person spotted in laundry.""**

I don’t have a petcam set up in that room. No reason my phone should ever use those words.

The notification vanished before I could tap it. Just blinked away like a typo reality corrected in front of me.

I checked the petcam. The little light was already on.

I swear – I swear on my dog’s life – the camera moved. Just a tiny adjustment. Like someone had put it back where it was supposed to be.

\* \* \* \* \*

By the time I saw him a third time, I’d stopped telling myself it was a coincidence.

I was unloading groceries from the car and it was getting dark, that blue hour where everything has soft edges. Rocket was inside, barking his head off because I’d left him behind the baby gate.

Across the road is another little stretch of trees. Nothing dramatic, just enough scrub to make it feel like we back onto something “natural” according to the real estate brochure.

I shut the boot and turned with an armful of bags and froze.

Someone was standing between the trees.  
Not moving.  
Just watching the house.

The same absent posture. The same tilt to the head.

“Oi!” I yelled before I could think. “Can I help you?”

They didn’t run. They didn’t even flinch. They just… stepped sideways into shadow and disappeared.

When I got inside, Rocket was staring at the living room camera, low growl rattling his chest.

The light on the petcam was already on.

\* \* \* \* \*

That brings us back to tonight.

I finally decided to do the sensible thing: new password. Two-factor authentication. All that. I sat down after dinner, opened my email to find the original warning, and saw a new one sitting on top of it.

Sent thirty minutes ago.

**“Your password has been changed. If this wasn’t you, please contact support immediately.”**

I hadn’t changed anything.

My heart did that horrible cold plunge. I grabbed my phone and opened the petcam app.

It logged in without asking for a code. Straight in.  
Because I was already “verified,” I guess.

The live feed popped up.

At first I didn’t understand what I was looking at. It was my living room, but the angle was wrong again – higher up, tilted slightly. I realised the camera must have been moved closer to the hallway.

Rocket appeared in the frame, pacing, looking from side to side. The audio hissed softly. Underneath the hiss was… something else.

Breathing.  
And not Rocket’s.

Slow. Too close to the microphone. Like someone was leaning right over the camera.

I stared at the screen, trying to rationalise it, and that’s when the porch light flicked on by itself.

In the petcam feed, the wash of light hit the front door. I hadn’t touched the switch.

Then:

*Tap.*

Not on the screen. In real life. On my actual window.

I turned my head so fast my neck crunched. Another tap, this time on the glass by the front door. Then a louder one.

Rocket went ballistic, sprinting back and forth, nails skidding on the floorboards.

The doorbell rang.

Not a normal impatient ring. Just a single, cheerful chime. Then silence. Then another. Like someone was pressing it with the patience of a person who already knows you’re home.

I put the phone down and crept to the door, staying to the side like every horror movie has taught me. I peered through the side gap in the curtain.

No one on the porch.  
But across the road, in the tree line—  
he was there.

Hoodie. Beanie. Head tilted in that same listening pose.

He lifted one arm and slowly, almost lazily, waved.

I dropped the curtain. The doorbell rang again, long and shrill this time. Rocket whined, backing up toward the hallway.

My phone buzzed. I looked down.

**New device added: Guest.**  
**Live view: ON.**

The petcam light in the living room flared, washing the doorway in that cold little LED glow.

From further down the house, near the back, I heard it:

The metallic *clunk* of a key sliding into a lock.

The laundry door.

For a second I couldn’t move. My body just shut down, like my brain had yanked the breaker switch.

Then the key turned.

It was such a normal sound. Familiar. I’ve done it a thousand times myself. That’s what made it worse. The ordinary click of someone who belongs here.

The door creaked open.

Rocket stopped barking. He went very still, ears flat, staring down the hall toward the laundry. A low whine leaked out of him, the kind dogs make at the vet.

The petcam app on my phone switched feeds. I didn’t touch it.

It cut from the live view of the living room to a different angle I’d never seen before.  
My hallway.  
From behind me.

There’s no camera there.

On the screen, I saw the back of my own head. My shoulders. Rocket pressed against my leg. And at the end of the hall, the open mouth of the doorway to the laundry – nothing but blackness beyond it.

Something moved in that darkness. Just a fragment of pale, like knuckles resting on the doorframe. Like someone leaning just out of sight.

The audio crackled, and a voice came through the phone speaker, too close to the mic, almost inside my ear.

“I told you,” it whispered. “You always do that in the hallway when you’re scared.”

My hand is shaking so hard it’s hard to type this. The doorbell just rang again, once, like punctuation.

Rocket is staring at the phone now, not the hallway. His tail is curled tight under him.

Whoever is in the laundry just started walking.

I can hear the bare, slow footsteps on the tiles, heading for the wooden boards. Heading for me.

The petcam light just went out.  
But the breathing in the speaker didn’t.",3,1765512467.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I have been working on processing UAV LiDAR point clouds into CAD surfaces. I would like to learn how to make better looking surfaces by using break lines. However, I am really struggling. 

Does anyone have a solid workflow for edge detection/break line extraction in LiDAR point clouds? Bonus points if it works within Trimble Business Center (TBC). 

I am mainly interested in manmade features like curbs, buildings, and retaining walls. 

So far I’ve tried using the line extraction feature in Trimble Business Center, but I’ve only gotten it to sort of work on relatively straight, continuous curbs like road sidewalks. I also explored Global Mapper’s breakline extraction, but the results weren’t great, and ideally, I’d like this to work on the point cloud as opposed to a DEM to avoid interpolation artifacts. 

Even if I have to manually digitize them myself, I would really appreciate a nudge in the right direction and I would happily buy you a coffee if I can pick your brain. From one scientist to another, cheers!",1,1765511983.0,remotesensing,0,1.0,False

Venting.,"God, remember that feeling when you start a new job, and you're actually excited? That was me. Landed a gig at a huge F&B company and felt like I was finally in control of my career. I knew it would be challenging, but I was passionate and just wanted to do good work. So damn naive.

My simple plan of ""do a good job"" didn't stand a chance against my boss. She's the puppet master of the entire office, and I swear her full-time job is just playing mind games. Suddenly, everything was political.

Who I talked to at the coffee machine mattered.

Where I ate lunch mattered.

Which colleagues were ""safe"" to be friends with mattered.

It's suffocating. I feel like I'm constantly being watched, and she's orchestrating everything from the shadows. All because of her insane need for control.

And get this—the better I do my job, the worse it gets. My work consistently gets praise from higher-ups, and instead of being happy for the team, she gets visibly pissed. She'll never admit it, but you can see it. She acts like my success is a personal attack on her. I always make a point to mention her contributions, but it's never enough. She doesn't want to share credit; she wants to BE the credit. My wins are her wounds, and it’s exhausting.

It finally clicked that she doesn't see me as her employee; she sees me as her competition. She's convinced I'm gunning for her job. HER JOB. I literally just want to do my work, get paid, and go home. But no, I have to deal with her paranoia. She's actively isolating me, telling me who I can and can't trust.

I'm so incredibly drained. I was hired for my skills, but my real job description is ""professional ego-stroker"" for a deeply insecure manager. My passion for this industry is getting completely obliterated by the daily weight of just keeping her happy.

It's all on her. Has anyone else dealt with a boss this paranoid? How do you even survive it?

TL;DR: My boss is a paranoid nightmare who is threatened every time I do my job well. She micromanages my social life at work and treats me like a rival instead of an employee. The job is soul-crushing because of her.",1,1765511913.0,WorkRant,0,1.0,False

1pki3ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1pki3ha/a_review_of_claire_denis_chocolat_1988/,A Review of Claire Denis' 'Chocolat' (1988),"***''When you look at the hills, beyond the houses and beyond the trees, where the earth touches the sky, that's the horizon. Tomorrow, in the daytime, I'll show you something. The closer you get to that line, the farther it moves. If you walk towards it, it moves away.''***

'Chocolat' is a film that showcases the éclat of Isaach de Bankolé in a manner that is inescapably felt but can scarcely be intellectualised into text. His character, the houseboy Protée, holds repressed anguish in his eyes so palpably that by the noted shower scene, it is difficult to watch how painfully this whole system of colonisation bleeds into every part of his and his countrymen's lives; how the water and the soap run down his body and tear him up as his ''superiors'', despite their hitherto mild and genial governance, run past him standing clean and uncloaked.

There is something of Albert Camus' use of space, of silence, and of suggestion in the way 'Chocolat' unfolds. Camus is renowned for his literary work revolving around French Algeria, where he, like Claire Denis also in Colonial Africa, grew up; Denis' presentation of the story is far more pointedly anti-colonialist. There is a strength and a spirit in the African characters of 'Chocolat' which dignifies them beyond the tantrum-prone, demanding nurture in the flock of Western characters we are privy to. It must also be said that Robert Alazraki's work with the camera is unforgettable; I have latched onto the moving images of Cameroon's vistas and landscapes for many moments since seeing this film. The framing and capture of Black bodies is exquisite (and, of course, Protée's physical beauty is filmed with unparalleled clarity), and the representation of kaleidoscopic panoramas and scenery specifically outside of the Delans's home is a stark aide-memoire for the immovable breathlessness Africa evokes in its nakedness.

Under the ''benevolent'' employment of his French colonists, the Dalens, even as we witness his wonderfully close relationship with their young daughter, France, Protée has absolutely no power except for a passive magnetisation he induces in the family. An up-and-down relationship with Madame Dalens is a flagrant exhibit of the aforementioned magnetisation and slowly becomes a punishing force as it becomes less and less feasible in any capacity, even when they live in relative solitude during the short administrative absence of Monsieur Dalens—he must pay for the colonial constraints that forbid even a degree of consummation of their ongoing attraction, or, at least, Madame Dalens', for it is no surprise that Protée, who has the face of a noble African king, is of interest to her—but in a society constructed on superiority, the line of the horizon is unfettered; always elusive, writing the rules. At one point in the film, a coterie of French visitors, specifically women, who overlook Protée as he works, compliment Madame Dalens for her houseboy's beauty; the next scene depicts the house chef being derided by a vulgar Frenchman for the ''disgusting'' quality of his coffee; the feelings and fondness of these French settlers towards African sights and sensibilities flit like the flighty whims of fleas.

Protée is reduced to an inertia that, even when dealing with the unabating, abhorrent racism and violent provocation of the arrogant Luc (a later arrival to the residence after a plane crash), he is a deeply dulled defender of his besieged body—because that is where the tactility of Claire Denis shines—in framing bodies; the twitching, the tension, the tautness, the dirt, and the blood—and so she achieves a potent depiction of ownership, of the reduction of a body to chattel in all but name. This comes to a head so that, although Protée subdues Luc easily and with characteristic poise, his restraint is excessively great in spite of his wildly agitated physical comportment—a testament to de Bankolé's acute command over his generally statuesque character.

To the latter point, there are countless scenes when Protée's countenance is comparable to that of an omniscient God, of a being charged by a sophisticated grace in movement, speech, physiognomy, and work, but all it takes for the construction of his graceful person to come tumbling down is a shower outside, under the bright light of his own country's sun; and when that is not torrid enough, he indelibly burns his hands on the pipe of a generator, holding a phlegmatic face. Claire Denis arranged a milestone delineation of colonialism with 1988's 'Chocolat', and it cannot go without saying that this film is a profoundly impressive debut that the rest of her career continued to live up to.",2,1765511677.0,TrueFilm,0,0.75,False

Sara Rooter was buried beside her mother today. The funeral was nice, the gathering at Rooter’s after was alright. He won’t starve based off the sheer amount of deli trays and Pyrex pans in his fridge and deep freezer. I didn’t stay very long, it was too crowded for my liking and it was too hot to keep sitting in my black pantsuit in a packed house. 

A note for your benefit dear reader, I know that suit from the thrift store looks fantastic and you want something nice to wear to weddings, funerals and court but make sure it’s not wool. 

I haven’t been sleeping well, but that feels like a punchline or something. I never sleep well. I guess I’ve been sleeping worse since Sara was found. Remember that nightmare I kept having last week? I think I was seeing how Sara died. I know I sound nuts. I am nuts but this is different. I was Sara in those dreams.

 Since she was found, I’ve been dreaming about trails of ash. I’ll be in my kitchen, making a cup of coffee and there’s a trail leading from my bedroom to the front door when I turn around, or from the front of the shop, down the street. It’s always in the background of my nightmares, like I’m catching it out of the corner of my eye before I’m eaten or whatever is doing whatever to me at that moment. 

Today has been a lot, and I have to open early tomorrow. Karen is stopping in before she goes on vacation but she can’t possibly wait until I open at 9 am, no no, I must open at 7 am to accept her oils. I sold 2 vials last week to a guy who uses it for bug repellent. I don’t need another 3 boxes to sit in my storage. I’m going to shower and go to bed. 

\*\*Monday, July 22nd 9:53 am\*\*

I got up early. I opened early. But guess who doesn’t show up until 9-goddamn-30? 

Karen decided to sleep in before her road trip. If I could jump across the counter, I think I would have shoved those oils down her throat until she stopped wiggling. Demeter did hiss at her, so that makes me feel a little better. 

So she’s doing her usual speech as she unpacks the oils across my counter and telling me this one cures this, and this one alines that, and apparently oregano oil cures Rheumatism and you must rub it counter clockwise or it won’t work. I don’t know, I stopped listening after she started talking about metal detox. As my eyes slowly drifted apart during her droning, I finally noticed what she was wearing. In traditional middle aged mother fashion, she had on a cream blouse and cotton trousers in an obnoxious pastel shade, chunky sandals, even chunkier necklace, somehow even the chunkiest possible earrings, and something black smeared into the skin at the top shell of her ear. It kinda looks like when a cartoon character has smoke coming out of their ears and that thought deeply tickles me. 

“Karen… you have a smudge.” She doesn’t stop talking, she doesn’t even seem to hear me. So I repeat myself a little louder. “Karen, you have a smudge on your ear.”  Once again, I am ignored. With a sigh and the precision of a tired mother, I lick my thumb and reach across the counter to remove the black smudge on the flat of her ear. 

She freezes for a moment, and I think I see her eye twitch. The look of disgust on her face also tickles me pink. Something switches in her demeanor and she seems to ignore the fact I indirectly licked her ear. 

“This one is new from headquarters. It’s the start of a new line entirely! All our oils are safe to ingest but this is meant to be drank! I’ve been putting in my tea and my husband’s coffee every morning and we are just thriving!” She holds up a small amber bottle, and to humor her I take it. As soon as I touch it, I feel the oil on the outside. These stupid things always leak. 

\*“Jimsonweed, for mental clarity”\* 

The label has the same scrolling cursive as the rest of her crap, but the material feels different. They’re usually a shiny plastic label so if the oil dribbles over the side it’s got a fighting chance of staying, but this one is papery and crooked. They must really be rushing the market on this. The bottle smells like a moldy bouquet, the flowery smell vaguely covering the smell of rot. I think it’s still stuck to my fingers.

“Thriving aye?” I mumble and hand it back, absentmindedly rubbing my hand dry on my pants. “If you say so… I’ll put it up when I go through the rest of your bottles. I’ll get your check.” I leave her and her pile of magical bottles of cure all at the counter to grab her check from the storage room. I hand the check off, and she goes on her merry way. 

\*\*Monday, July 22nd, 8:12 pm\*\*

The shop was pretty quite today, and I’m so so glad it was. Karen was the only one that came in, so no one saw my freak out. Or breakdown? Meltdown? I don’t know but it scared me. 

So about twenty minutes after Karen leaves, I’m sitting at the counter right? Demeter is tootling around, chasing rainbows from the sun catchers in the window. (Shout out to Cami who made them,  she’s our local tarot reading crystal lover and she makes theeee best saffron lattes) I’m filling out an inventory form for Rooter, and my hands start to shake a little. Ok, strange but not unheard of for the chronically ill. Maybe I need to eat, I’ll finish the form and get a snack real quick. No one will know I left. I return to my form, and the words are changing on me. I’m watching them change! The strokes of each letter are wriggling like tiny worms, pushing themselves across the paper. 

I don’t know how to upload photos on Reddit from my computer. I’m not tech savvy by any means so I can’t show you what the form is supposed to look like, bear with me ok? 

So this form is split into five sections. The top third of the page is for basic information like name of seller, address, phone number, date, those kinds of thing. The rest of the page is four columns, with the second one being the biggest. The first one is for the name of the item, the second is for the description, the third is for the quantity and the fourth is for the price per unit. 

So I’m filling this out for Rooter to drop off his check after work and the words start crawling to the middle of the page. They form a black mass in the center, writhing around in an undulating pile. I drop the pen and push myself away, my back hitting the wall. I know this isn’t real. It can’t be real. Words aren’t worms and they don’t come alive for fun. Slowly, they begin to untangle and spread out across the page again. 

“Ash to ash, eye for eye. What was lost will be reclaimed. What was accrued will be repaid.""

 In a wiggly, wormy font in the thickest column of the form. 

My legs give out from under me, and I slam my tailbone on the floor when I fall, sending a shockwave up my spine that instantly made me nauseated. I know words don’t move. Words can’t move, but those did. I watched them. 

Demeter peeks her head around the counter and trots over, rubbing her noggin against my leg and meeping about her rainbow hunt. As much as I want to pay attention, the nagging feeling in my stomach has started to crawl up. I grab the trash can from under the counter, and manage not to vomit on myself or the cat. When I finished, my ribs were sore from being hunched over for so long. 

I grab the counter and pull myself up on shaking legs. The worms have stopped moving on the paper, and the inventory form seems to be back in working order for Rooter. 

While testing my best impression of a newborn fawn, I hobble to the little bathroom by the stairs to rinse my mouth out. Before I flick on the light, I turn the tap on and slurp up a mouthful, swishing my mouth clean. I hit the switch as I straighten up and spit, like a multitasking queen as the kids say, and it’s black. Whatever I spit out, was black. My spit is black, there’s a greyish black…stuff smeared around my mouth, and whatever it was didn’t taste like stomach acid, it was almost like chewing on a pencil. Woody, metallic and absolutely fucking disgusting. I couldn’t get that flavor out of my mouth no matter how many times I swished and spat. 

I washed my face, and swished a few more times before I went back to the counter. Like I said, no one came in. When I closed the shop up, I still felt weird, and decided Rooter can wait for a day. I just wanted my bed and my cat. Demeter is curled up beside me while I type, keeping her big ol eyes trained on my face. It’s been a while since I broke like that, and I think she knows. 

I’m going to call Mr. Shriner and ask for the day off tomorrow.

 

\*\*Wednesday, July 24th 6:49 pm\*\*

I took yesterday off. Mr. Shriner didn’t answer when I called, but I decided to take it anyway. I was so sore when I woke up I couldn’t get myself out of bed. So, instead I slept all day. You know what’s weird though? I didn’t have a single nightmare. I didn’t have a weird dream either. I didn’t have any dreams at all. It was nothing but the sweet blackness of dead to the world sleep. 

I finally crawled from my cacoon of blankets at around five, and got dressed to take Rooter his check. Since they found Sara, he stopped leaving the house. Usually we don’t do drop offs, but I wanted to make sure he was alright. We’re not friends per-say, but I enjoyed our chats when he’d come in and it’s the least I could do. 

When I pulled in, the house was dark. When I knocked, he didn’t answer. I stuck the check in his little mail slot and peeked in while I was bent over. Still dark in there, and there was a smell. Like old air and… something plant like. Maybe he went somewhere after all. I wouldn’t want to stay alone like that either. 

I didn’t dream last night. I shut my eyes, fell into the abyss, and woke up with three little cat paws jammed in my neck hours later.

 Mr. Shriner called while I drank my coffee to apologize for Ian not showing up to collect the bank bag yesterday. I forgot that was the Tuesday thing. Oops. 

I decided to come clean and tell him I was “sick” and I wouldn’t have opened the door anyway. 

“Did you get that stomach bug too? God it’s horrible, tearing though the town like a plague. I’ve never seen a stomach bug cause such a fever. Ian was hallucinating smoking people or something… I wonder why people smoking scared him… he smokes too.” 

I lie again and tell him yes, I had the horrid fever inducing stomach bug. The old man wishes me well and hangs up, saying nothing about my day off. Win I guess. I dress myself in something cozy and toddle downstairs, my tailbone still sore from falling the other day. 

Ian pulled in at the same time I flipped my sign, looking like he did have a fever inducing stomach bug the day before. He was still rather unsteady, leaning on walls and the counter to support himself, and a pale cast on his face. 

“Hey Ian… if I knew you were still sick I could have dropped it off after work…” I quickly shake the money into the bag, keeping an eye on him in case he decides to keel over. I’d prefer he did that outside so his ghost isn’t kicking around in here for the rest of time. He shrugs as he looks around the store, his eyes settling on Demeter as she rolls in a pile of catnip. “Where’s her leg?” 

A quick story break for my sweet little cohort, I found Demeter in a dumpster behind my apartment back in Chicago. I know, classic story, but she was tiny and sick and I loved her little calico butt. When I got her to the vet, they said she had an infection in the bone of her front left leg and an astonishingly high fever. So I scraped together as much as I could and they took her leg. The infection left her mildly deaf, and with 3 and a half legs. Because I thought it was comedy gold, I named her Demeter Stix. Because De Meter stick has a little more then 3 feet. Buh dum Tis.

 I recounted all this to Ian as I have you and actually got a laugh from him. The rest of the visit went off without a hitch, but I did notice he needed to wash behind his ears. He had a black smudge up the back of it. I suppose I’ll forgive the transgression since he was sick. I guess I’ve become the smudge police. He needed a shower though, he smelled like he tried to cover the sickly smell with granny’s perfume.

\*\*Friday, July 26th 11:23 pm\*\*

Our quaint little town is throwing their plant festival next weekend and preparations are underway. Mr. Shriner even wrangled me into it this year. Usually, I push off the task to Ian but he’s going out of town I guess and Shriner obviously can’t do it so I must be the proprietor of our little stall. 

The plant festival has some long formal name that I can’t remember but it’s basically done to honor the forest that surrounds our town. The town was first settled as a logging camp, then turned into a….station I guess? It was still supposed to be mobile and easy to deconstruct but they ended up sticking around and built a few stores and an inn, then expanded to actual houses and a real saw mill. I don’t entirely understand what is so special about the woods because the trees look like the average kind of forest you’d expect around here. Even in the photos from when the mill was first built, they were processing standard sized trees. Nothing like what you’d see out west, just regular old trees. I heard once the trees grow really fast, and that’s why the saw mill was open for so long without decimating the forest. 

So, every year we have a festival to honor the forest. It’s pretty pagan for being a small midwestern town, with pyre burnings and offerings to the forest. And so many tchotchkes. Like… figures of little tree sprites, t-shirts, beer cozies, you name it, someone will make it with their cricut or their 3D printer thing. Our stall however, handles the kettle corn. Weird right? You’d think we sell something tchotchke-esque but nope. It’s good ol kettle corn. We do two flavors usually, but someone convinced Shriner to try a new one this year. So instead of caramel and cinnamon-caramel (and the difference is important here) we’re doing caramel and something called “Jed Mei’s snow”. I don’t know who Jed Mei is, and why his snow is special but Ian says it’ll kettle the corn nicely and now I have three big cartons of weird white powder in my storage closet. 

\*\*Sunday, July 28th, 9:34 pm\*\*

I finally seen Rooter today, but I almost didn’t recognize him. I had the day off, and needed to wash my sheets and get groceries so I bundled up my bedding and grabbed my fancy reusable bags that I usually forget, then headed for town. We have a laundry mat that’s run by a couple from the city, and they offer this really cool service where you drop off your laundry and they wash it for you for a couple bucks more then doing it yourself. If you bring your own soap, it’s even cheaper. I’m not inherently a busy person, but who has time to watch their laundry spin right? 

Sometimes I even sweeten the pot and bring overstock from the shop. They’re really into these soap bars Laura Laney makes so I give them some of the ones that don’t sell well, and I pay her out of my own pocket. It’s cheaper that way in the long run, I swear. 

So I dropped my laundry off and head for the market on the other side of town. I caught Rooter, or more specifically his truck, in the parking lot. I knew it was his truck, but the man sitting inside didn’t look a damn thing like our jolly woodcarver. 

He’s lost weight. A lot of weight. He was a rather large man, and now his cheeks are starting to sink. He’s got a sizable beard on him, and a weird tallowy color to his skin. Smudges of something covered his ears and under his nose, leaving a black tint on his newly sprouted stashe. This was not normal Rooter appearance.

But, I knew it was him when he lifted his hand to the wheel. Rooter, and a few other gentlemen in this town wear rings for some union thing their grandfathers were in back when the mill was in its prime. They’re exactly what you think they’d look like. Fat gold cigar bands with a square stone and the little emblem carved into it. The stone in this case is a dark green with a single, wicked looking tree carved into it.

I waved at him as I passed by, and he turned to look at me but didn’t really seem to look \*at\* me, you know? Maybe I need to stop in again.

Ben and Jerry’s was on sale, so that was cool but nothing else remarkable consumed my day off. 

\*\*Monday, July 29th, 3:24 am\*\*

The nightmares have finally returned, with a vengeance. Maybe they missed me. 

So I’m standing in the center of town during the festival, taking in the sights. Ian is at the kettle corn stand as usual, Mr. Shriner is making a speech with the rest of the chamber of commerce, kids squealing, haphazardly put together fair rides are playing their recorded calliope music. Absolutely picture perfect small town festival behavior.

 

I get a bag of kettle corn from Ian and I start munching on it, walking around to check out the stalls. My hands start to shake again, like they did the other day and the color of everything around me starts to mottle out. Faces are wiped away and replaced with this thick, black haze like a shroud.  

Black smoke starts leaking out of where their mouths and noses, filling the sky with thin streams of almost solid black clouds. Then these… I can’t even call them humans anymore, start to writhe around, collapsing to the ground in pain all at once. Their bodies start to disintegrate into ash and release more black smoke and I feel like I’m choking on it. I’m choking on them.

I jerked awake and ended up on the floor, choking on smoke from the dream world. Demeter hangs her fluffy little noggin over the bed and stairs down at me, bothered by the loss of her blankets as I accidentally took them with me to the floor. She merps and hops down, laying on the pile of blankets as I untangle myself. She drifts off again as I go to the bathroom for a drink. I flick on the light and flinch at the accidental flashbang I gave myself, but I can’t turn the light off again. I can still see the smoke rising from those… things. 

I don’t know how I managed to get dirty while sleeping, but there was something black in my ear.

It doesn't matter nearly as much in the Sanbuq due to its higher capacity, but I found the Junk just a little cramped in terms of storing provisions. I found that my most-consumed provisions were firewood and water, in that order. To cook 3-4 fish daily, you need two firewood, and you need to keep an eye on the stove to avoid burning your food. However, you CANNOT burn soup, meaning you can set it and forget it without fear of wasting much of anything. And while soup spoils within a day of making it, it doesn't start spoiling until it's off the heat. Also, you only need ONE unit of firewood to boil soup.

The experiment:

I purchased a large pot at DC as part of trip prep back to GRC. It took quite a lot of water to fill, and held 5-6 fish at full capacity. The first day, I made a full pot of soup and left it overnight, sustaining myself on fresh food from DC.

In the morning of the second day, my hunger and thirst were low enough to think about drinking the soup. I drank just enough to replenish most, but not all of my hunger and thirst. The pot was still more than half-full, and I refilled it with 5 units of water. I spent the day fishing, and found 3 fish was enough to refill the pot. I cooked it on one unit of firewood and left it alone.

On the third day, the pot had still not spoiled! I once again replenish hunger and thirst, and refill the pot with water and fish. I forgot how much water I refilled it with, but I once again only needed 3 fish.

By the fourth day, I decided I had enough data to suggest this is a reasonable strategy. As such, I developed a daily schedule around perpetual stew.

1. Wake up in the morning, drink soup
2. Refill pot with water.
3. Fishing for fish to fill the pot. If you're up around sunrise, you should be done around 0900-1030, plenty of time to spare.
4. Noon navigational reading.
5. Toss firewood onto the stove. Remember the time you did this, as you'll want to do this again the next day around a similar time; leave it too long and your perpetual stew can still spoil!

I arrived back at GRC on Day Eight. I moored up and spent the night at the tavern. Returning to the boat in the morning, I found my perpetual stew spoiled, as I had forgotten to boil it the night before, pending arrival to GRC. This is why I added Step 5 in the above schedule.

A few days later (after changing my new Junk's sail plan), I decided to test perpetual stew in the smaller sized pot. The strategy still works, and takes fewer resources to start up (for obvious reasons). However, with the big pot, you can get away with not refilling it for one day, as long as you remember to boil it daily. With the small pot, you run the risk of fully draining it if you don't replenish daily.

Overall, upkeep on Perpetual Stew feels efficient on firewood usage. Whereas you'd need two firewood just to cook your fish, you only need one firewood to maintain Perpetual Stew. Also, cooking fish requires multiple slots on your stove. You only need one slot for Perpetual Stew, leaving more space available for coffee, tea, or anything else you might want to cook up. However, due to the startup costs, small-pot Perpetual Stew only really makes sense if your trip lasts more than three days. Large-pot Perpetual Stew seems to make sense for trips over five days. Of course, if you don't mind maintaining your stew while you're in port, the startup cost would be a one-time thing.

TL;DR: If you keep re-boiling soup within a 24h period, it won't spoil. You can refill a partially-empty soup pot and keep it going indefinitely, for a small savings in firewood usage.

\-guy doing dumbbell rows in front of the rack—like right there on it. It was about 5 PM, and the gym was moderately busy (and the free weight area is small and congested anyway).

He's already been there twice and told me that there's a lot of places to visit and food to eat, so I'm excited and it's a perfect opportunity to take the rest of the year easy after unsuccessfully trying to find a job after I was fired for no reason back in June, won't get into those details for personal reasons. Anyway, I'm not much of an outdoors person and pretty much prefer to stay at home, either scrolling through social media, playing videogames, or watching a movie or TV show, however when I do go out I do like going to shopping malls which my Dad has told me that there are shopping malls that are connected together via ""glass-tunnel-bridges"" so you can just walk them from one shopping mall to the other. 

Here's where I might feel a bit like a fish out of water, when I mostly go to shopping malls my go-to store is Hottopic, which for those in this sub who don't know what that store is it's basically a clothing store that sells- well clothes of numerous movies/TV shows, anime, videogames, and they also sell keychains, buttons, collectibles, etc. I tried looking up if there were any Hottopic stores in Colombia but unfortunately it's apparently an American company only so no luck there, I was wondering if anyone knew any similar stores that ya'll could be kind enough to recommend? 

Another place I'd like for ya'll to recommend are places to go eat, I mostly eat fast food, with Wendy's and Popeye's being my two go-tos although I do occasionally eat at restaurants that have a buffet, hoping there's food that I like...I'm a bit of a picky eater, I like burgers (with no veggies, just cheese, meat, and bacon if available if not then just a regular cheeseburger), I do like fries but they have to be seasoned well (funny story, I spent most of my childhood avoiding fries cause of texture issues but then I tried them in Popeye's and ended up liking them, although when I had them at McDonald's once I ended up hating them cause they tastes like pure oil and that's when I realized that it was McDonald's fries the reason why I avoided eating them most of my childhood...anyway, back to the post), I also like pasta (without the red sauce, any pasta with ""alfredo sauce"" is ok), and I have a major sweet tooth lol. 

Lastly places for one to recreate and have fun, my personal favorite places to hang out it are comicbook/collector's stores, videogame stores, coffee shops, I have more but I can't remember them at the moment, but yeah those two are the main places I like it hang out in either by myself or with a few friends.

So please feel free to recommend me any of these places, and I'll let my Dad know so we can go visit them, also feel free to recommend any places to go sight-seeing although my Dad will probably take me to ones he's already visited, historic places to learn more about Colombia's culture and I do hope I get to enjoy this trip...I'm a little nervous since it's my first time going to a new country that isn't the US, I'm from Puerto Rico if ya'll were wondering, anyway that's all...have a great day everyone! 😁",1,1765510641.0,Colombia,6,1.0,False

I have been dairy free for almost 6 weeks with two known “slips”. I have decided to reintroduce dairy to see if it truly was CMPI or not. I started yesterday morning at 8am and had some regular whole milk creamer in my coffee. This morning I had a yogurt and more whole milk creamer. So far the only thing I’ve noticed is my baby finally pooped (two weeks after cutting dairy my baby went from pooping daily to pooping every 7-9 days with horrible gas). But, this could’ve been coincidental and the poop was normal looking!! She has gas but she’s always had bad gas no matter what. Otherwise I don’t think I’m seeing anything different. Fussiness is about the same as usual. I think she’s also going through a growth spurt or leap because she’s been fussier lately anyway and sleep has been horrible (since prior to reintroducing) so it’s hard to tell if I’m seeing a difference or not.

I have been on beach dates, coffee dates, ice cream dates, lunch dates, farmers market dates, netflix and chill dates. I meet people 90% from bumble or tinder and I met one irl at a nightclub.

I am running into a problem though, I can find first dates easily and generate interest, however, this interest is very intense for a week then dies out either the day of the date (cancelling last min) or a few days after the first date. Girls will say I'm handsome, ""when are you going to take me on a date"", flirting with me, sending me spicy pics etc. 

I understand people cancelling right before a date, but after the first date I must be doing something wrong on the date. I just act normally and ask them about themselves, share stuff about myself that is relevant to what they have said etc. Maybe I am boring idk, I have experimented with challenging them to activities or playing truth and dare etc but still the same outcome. 

I have been on 3 dates with one girl a few years ago and I fumbled badly so thats on me but I was just acting the same back then as I do now on dates. If anything I have gotten a lot better since I have gained experience. I still have a long way to go though.

1pkhffg,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1pkhffg/start_a_consciousness_laboratory/,Start a Consciousness Laboratory,"This phrase wandered into my thoughts today so I'll just start writing and see how it turns out. My target audience are those of you who want to explore what this consciousness thing is all about and you're not sure where to start.

In my experience, I have found it beneficial to engage in various ""tests"" to isolate different aspects of conscious experience. There's much talk about meditation, which is an excellent means of creating controlled conditions, but this is not the only way. These controlled conditions are like a sterile lab environment where you can look at things under a microscope. But I want you, my dear scientists, to recognize that you are walking around every day with all that lab equipment rattling around in your head. The consciousness lab is mobile, so let's bring it out into the field.

It would behoove you to start your field studies with a solid hypothesis for how conscious experience works. While you could go out in the world and scratch your head as to why apples fall from trees, you would make a lot more progress if you started your curiosity journey from the firm foothold of Newtonian physics. From there you can test your observations against an existing framework and develop your arguments in favor or against.

When it comes to consciousness, there is a name that rivals Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein: Siddhartha Gautama. Otherwise known as The Buddha, or The Awakened One in English. I know, I know. There's a lot of mysticism and gurus and a myriad spiritual systems that are invoked in your mind when you hear the titles, but listen. This guy was extremely smart and he approached consciousness as a scientist. He wanted you, as I do, to be skeptical of what he says and test these things out for yourself. And he provided an excellent framework for you to test against.

According to Siddhartha, and indeed my own results from my consciousness laboratory, you are made up of five ""kandas"". Kanda is a word that means ""lump"" in English and it referred to the shoulder back in Siddhartha's day. They didn't have as sophisticated an understanding of anatomy back then so I won't fault him haha. Everything was lumps, I guess. In this context it means more like ""component"". Your whole subjective experience is made up of five components.

What are those five components?
* You have a body with a nervous system and sensory organs. The body and nervous system allows you to have the subjective experience of physical sensations like warmth, cramps, tension, the feeling of fur or metal, and that sort of thing. The sensory organs allow you to see colors, hear music, smell oranges, and taste chocolate.
* You have a sense on whether something is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Maybe you love cilantro, maybe you hate cilantro, maybe you don't care one way or another about it. But it's gotta be one of these things.
* You have this pattern recognition and language part of your brain. When you see a cat, you recognize it as a cat and you think ""that's a cat.""
* You have emotional structures in your brain and thinking structures in your brain. These results in thoughts (including such things as an inner voice, doing math in your head, having a song stuck in your head, etc.) and feelings (including such things as anger, sorrow, love, etc.)
* You have a frame of consciousness and an awareness of all the above stuff going on within it. This is the television on which all subjective experience plays.

So that's the framework. It's one thing to read all that and be like ""yeah, I totally get it"" and it's a totally different thing to be like ""ohhhhh I see it now."" This is where your mobile consciousness lab comes in.

Like any good scientist, you will want to carry a field journal with you. When you're out and about in your day, at some random point in your day when you have a few minutes, bust out that journal and write down what you're experiencing in each of those five categories. This isn't a diary meant for you to deliberate on your thoughts. You will want to make this *brief*, so don't dwell on any particular category for too long. Just write down the high level stuff. ""I was experiencing these physical sensations, seeing this, hearing that, these types of thoughts were in my head, this type of emotion was present, I felt it was pleasant/unpleasant"".

Make it a point to go for a walk once a week or so and stop by a park bench or sit under a tree or go to a coffee shop if you live in a nature desert. Someplace where you can spend 15-20 minutes to try a more robust field experiment. In this test, you want to see if you can isolate the pattern matching and language part of your subjective experience. Just sit there and look at something. A tree, a statue, a car. Whatever it is. Just look at it with a soft gaze in the middle distance. Try to quiet your thoughts and feelings and physical sensations and just look. At the end, bust out your journal and note your experience.

After a few tries at that, try to maintain that soft gaze while walking around, trying not to come up with words and labels for the things that you see. Then write down your experience.

As another field study, take some time to reflect on your day at the end of the day and write down the emotions you felt in chronological order. Not the thoughts or the ""reasons"", just the emotions. The next day, write down your experienced emotions once an hour or so. Is the size of the list different? Is it because there were more emotional situations in the day or because of issues with memory? Whatever your findings are, it could lead to further tests in exploring conscious experience.

Try going to a shopping plaza or grocery store and try isolating out each of your sensory organs. Can you direct your awareness to focus on sounds, without the labels and pattern recognition? What are the qualities and limitations of sound experience? Can you direct your awareness to focus on smells, without the labels and pattern recognition? What are the qualities and limitations of smell experience? Spend a few minutes really spending time with each sense and write down your findings in your field journal between each sense.

After a while you should have a journal full of notes for each one of these ""kandas""/components of conscious experience. Go back through your notes and try to write the qualities and limitations of each component. Bonus points if you can correlate your data to find patterns in pleasant/unpleasant/neutral.

Then take a step back and wonder ""is there anything in my subjective experience that I'm missing?"" See if you can come up with questions to ask this reddit, or just share your notes and consider the comments. Do the comments seem valid? Do they spur new ideas to test out in the field, or in more controlled lab settings?

You are the only one who can do this exploration. No one else, only you. The frontier of consciousness is waiting. Have fun!",1,1765509752.0,awakened,0,1.0,False

 Let's begin with the catuai bliss that was kind of controversial here:

Description:

Cafelino is a family-run business located in Boquete, in the Chiriquí mountains. Specializing in sustainable specialty coffee, they combine tradition, innovation, and respect for nature to offer exceptional coffee.

At the heart of the operation lies Finca Santa Elena, perched between 1,250 and 1,530 meters above sea level. Thanks to its unique volcanic terroir and meticulous production methods, Santa Elena produces coffees renowned for their rich aroma and exceptional quality.

This Catuai benefits from a unique process: an 84-hour whole-cherry fermentation in sealed tanks, followed by partial pulping to obtain a ""semi-washed"" profile. This process gives it a silky texture, fruity aromas, and a beautiful clarity.

In the cup, it offers a harmonious balance of freshness, sweetness, and complexity, revealing an elegant, clean, and fragrant coffee. An ideal set for lovers of refined single-origin coffees.

Flavor note:Clementine - Orange Zest - Toffee

  
The second one is the Totumas pache,the description has nothing special,so let's only go with the flavor notes,which is:Blueberry - Dried Plum - Praline,and sliky texture.

There are few more advent coffee in their new arrival,but all for the coming days,like day 22,so I won't do a spoiler,but if you are interested,or in case they sell out，you can take a look yourself.Hope these will help and let's enjoy our coffees!",1,1765509710.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,0,1.0,False

You're not alone. I’ve noticed tons of people around me, smart, ambitious, even high-performing types, constantly complaining about brain fog, forgetfulness, mental fatigue, or just feeling scattered. It’s not just aging. It’s not just tech. And it’s not a lack of motivation.

It’s habits. More specifically, brain habits we never learned in school.

After diving deep into neurology research, longevity science, and productivity psychology, I realized most of us are unintentionally sabotaging our cognitive performance. I've pulled together insights from top researchers, bestselling books, and episodes like the Mel Robbins podcast (yes, that ENCORE episode is legit gold) to distill what actually works. This post is a curated toolkit, not motivational fluff. No toxic hacks from TikTok. Just real science-backed tools for energy, clarity and memory retention.

Let’s break it down. These are the 3 non-negotiables.

---

- ✳️ 1. Get serious about sleep CONSISTENCY  
  Your brain literally takes out the neural trash while you sleep. But if your sleep schedule is all over the place, you’re messing with everything from memory formation to emotional regulation.

  - According to Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep and professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley), irregular sleep disrupts the glymphatic system, which clears toxins from the brain. Research published in Science (2013) shows poor sleep is directly linked to cognitive decline and even Alzheimer’s risk.
  - The Mel Robbins Podcast highlights this in her interview with Dr. Andrew Huberman, where they explain how going to bed and waking up at consistent times, even on weekends, is more important than how long you sleep.
  - App rec:  
    - ⁂ Sleep Cycle – This app wakes you during your lightest sleep phase and tracks sleep debt with eerie precision. Its smart alarm feature actually changed how groggy I feel in the mornings. Great UI too.

---

- ✳️ 2. Build a morning brain reboot routine  
  Before ANY caffeine or screen time, your focus and mood are fragile. What you do in the first 30 minutes literally sets your brain chemistry for the day.

  - Neuroscientist and author Dr. Tara Swart (The Source) explains how cortisol peaks shortly after waking. Checking your phone first thing spikes dopamine and creates a reward-seeking loop that kills long-term focus.  
  - Mel Robbins’ 5 Second Rule pairs well here. Instead of doom-scrolling, count down “5-4-3-2-1” and get out of bed immediately. Then do one small brain-healthy ritual: stretch, journal, or walk.  
  - Podcast rec:  
    - ⁂ Huberman Lab Podcast - Try the “Morning Routine for Peak Mental Performance” episode. Non-BS explanations of what light exposure, hydration and breathwork actually do for your neurochemistry.

---

- ✳️ 3. Micro-dosing movement = macro-focus gains  
  Long workouts aren’t necessary. But integrating short “exercise snacks” into your day can boost memory, focus, even mental stamina better than coffee.

  - Dr. Wendy Suzuki (NYU neuroscientist) found in her lab that just 10 minutes of physical activity increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) aka brain fertilizer.  
  - The American Psychological Association published data showing that movement breaks improve working memory and reverse fatigue in knowledge workers.  
  - YouTube rec:  
    - ⁂ Move With Nicole – Her 10-minute mobility flows are designed to reset posture and breathing, helping mental clarity without full-on sweat.

---

Let’s talk tools. If you want to go deeper, here are some next-level resources I swear by:

- ⁂ Book: The Genius Life by Max Lugavere  
  NYT bestseller, host of the Genius Life podcast, and science journalist. This book blew my mind on how diet, exercise and light exposure reprogram brain aging. Max breaks it all down into daily steps. This is hands-down the most practical brain-optimization book I’ve come across. You’ll want to highlight every page. It made me rethink my grocery list AND my morning routine.

- ⁂ Book: The Organized Mind by Daniel J. Levitin  
  Neuroscientist and musician, Levitin helps you understand why your brain was never meant to multitask this much. This book will make you question your entire relationship with information overload. Eye-opening chapters on attention, memory, and decision fatigue. This is the best book if you constantly feel mentally scattered in the digital age.

- ⁂ Book: Spark by Dr. John Ratey  
  Harvard psychiatrist. This book is pure jet fuel for understanding the connection between movement and cognitive performance. If you’ve ever wondered why a walk clears your head, this explains it with real science. Insanely good read, especially the chapters on ADHD, mood disorders, and learning.

- ⁂ App: Brain.fm  
  This isn’t background noise, it’s neuroscience-backed audio. Designed to sync with your brain’s activity using functional music. I tried it on a deadline and actually forgot to check my phone for 90 minutes. Wild. Great for deep work sessions and ADHD brains.

- ⁂ App: BeFreed – An AI-powered self-growth app built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts. It creates on-demand personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You can choose your own voice, adjust the depth from quick summaries to deep dives, and even chat with your virtual coach for tailored content. It pulls from books, papers, and expert talks to make complex ideas digestible and actionable. Perfect for anyone who wants to replace social media with science-backed learning that actually sticks.

- ⁂ YouTube: Dr. Sten Ekberg – Former Olympian turned holistic health expert. His videos on brain fog, insulin resistance and neuroinflammation are super digestible. Watch his “Top 10 Foods That Damage Your Brain” and thank me later.

- ⁂ Podcast: Mel Robbins Podcast  
  Start with the “A Better Brain: 3 Habits” ENCORE ep. It’s not just motivational. She breaks it down with researchers in language that actually sticks. Real talk meets real science. One of the most actionable episodes I’ve listened to all year.

---

Most advice out there is either too vague or way too technical. What actually works is daily consistency with just a few high-impact changes. Start with one of the above. Watch your energy, memory and attention shift in less than a week.

What you make of automatic espresso machines and would you own one alongside your regular espresso machine? [$2000],"A while back we had a regular Breville Barista. We didn't like it. Traded it in. Went for nespresso to make life easy. That was crazy decision. The espresso tasted watery and was luke-warm all the time.  Came to find out that there is such little coffee inside those capsules to the water ratio thats why. Now some people go for automatic machines like Jura or Delonghi, but I can't help wonder if they suffer from the same thing Nespresso did. Weak. Not hot. I was doing some research on the temp of the water and it was really low compared to using a PID on an espresso machine and a single boiler or just a kettle. Apparently its because the companies want to avoid lawsuits with water being too hot.

Like I love the ease of having an automatic say like a Delonghi rivelia for those days you can't be bothered with pissingaround with grinding, tamping, all that jazz but I do wonder if the automatic espresso machines even the high ends ones over $2,000 are a waste of money because, you are going to the issues people seem to run into, weak coffee, not enough coffee is coming out, what does come out is not hot, and then things breaking.

Im so used to my V60 and a goosneck kettle. Boilng it to a set temp and getting a hot coffee.

So my question is, im considering buying either:

1. Profitec Go $1,620 but they said they would throw in a grinder DF54
2. Quick Mill Pop-up $1,613 with a DF54 grinder
3. Or just getting a Delonghi rivelia $1399 on amazon then just hit a button and boom.

Music Pattern 

The music in *FROM* isn’t just background noise; it acts like a character of its own, subtly guiding our emotions and hinting at the underlying dynamics of the town. If we were to chart the emotional ebb and flow of the series, the soundtrack would be right there at the core.


**The Jukebox: A Time Capsule Out of Place**

The jukebox tunes draw heavily from the rock, country, folk, and blues of the 60s and 70s. These genres aren’t about nostalgia; they evoke a sense of dislocation. Tracks like “Town Without Pity,” “Highway Star,” and “Ol’ ’55” revolve around themes of being trapped or yearning to escape. The jukebox isn’t merely a diner fixture; it embodies the soundscape of individuals caught between journeys. Interestingly, every song from the jukebox comes from a realm where escape seems possible. Yet in *FROM*, these tracks loop endlessly, like echoes of a chorus that never arrives.


**Recurring Songs as Emotional Anchors**

Certain tracks recur like familiar omens. “If I Had a Boat” appears three times, perfectly capturing the essence of longing for freedom—the boat, the horse, the magical escape that feels just out of reach. Each time it plays, it coincides with moments when hope is both enticing and a little delusional. Boyd the storm


Then there's Joni Mitchell’s “Blue,” which surfaces in both Season 1 and Season 3. It’s not about sadness; it’s about clarity. When it plays, tabitha confront her own reflections—regret, longing, and a raw honesty. It’s like holding a mirror up to those who are struggling.


**Pixies’ “Que Sera Sera”**
This track becomes the show's anthem, but not in the upbeat Doris Day style. The Pixies transform it into a haunting lullaby. The vibe is deceptively calm, almost like someone softly humming to keep despair at bay. The lyrics suggest inevitability, while the sound evokes a sense of unease, creating a compelling contradiction that resonates throughout the series.


The use of “Celebration” in Season 3 is one of the most jarring moments in the soundtrack. It plays right after Tian-Chen’s death, which feels absurdly out of place. This tonal shift is intentional, reflecting the Tower’s influence. A moment meant for grief morphs into an awkward festivity, as the system attempts to mask sorrow with forced joy. This moment highlights how the soundtrack serves as an external force in the narrative, going beyond mere production choices.


**Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen—The Prophets of Liminal Space**

These artists carry a unique, mythic sadness. Orbison’s dreamlike soundscapes, Dylan’s apocalyptic tales, and Cohen’s spiritual acceptance all speak to characters standing at the edge of something profound. They’re used sparingly at pivotal emotional junctures: “Hurricane” plays when chaos reigns and moral clarity is murky. “If It Be Your Will” surfaces during moments of surrender, when characters admit they can’t control their fates.“A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” marks a point when danger escalates to something biblical.

These songs don’t explain *FROM*; they echo the experience of being enveloped by it.

**Jade’s Violin: Hope Amidst Chaos**

Jade’s violin solos are the only original sounds within the town’s confines. Everything else is a nostalgic echo. His music represents an effort to bring order to a chaotic world. In contrast, the music box melody serves as a fear distortion, alluring yet destructive. When Jade plays alongside it, it’s like witnessing a dialogue between two opposing forces. By Season 3, “Eternal Lullaby” signifies his transition from an outsider to becoming part of the town’s intricate web.


**Genre Distribution: A Quiet Pattern Emerges**

Rock, folk, blues, and outlaw country dominate the soundtrack. These genres share common threads: They tell stories (journeys, confessions, revelations), They feature outsider archetypes (rebels, wanderers, the haunted). They exist in the space between the sacred and the ordinary.


Notably absent are metal, pop, and hip-hop. Disco makes a fleeting appearance in “Celebration,” yet even then, it feels out of place, which is precisely the point. The soundtrack is carefully curated to evoke a sense of liminality.


**Season-by-Season Energy Curve**

In Season 1, music is used sparingly, almost like a whisper from the town. Season 2’s cues reflect instability, with songs appearing only at the beginning and end, as the chaos in between is too intense for music to settle in. By Season 3, the few tracks are precise, landing at significant emotional shifts.

The overall pattern reveals a gradual retreat: the town becomes more musically silent as the seasons progress, as if hope is being consumed little by little.


There's something wonderfully wild happening with the ""From"" playlist—something the creator cleverly hinted at, but most viewers seem to have missed it.The jukebox isn't just background music; it acts as a narrative system. The genres chosen aren't random; they reflect the energy of the moment.



The songs in the jukebox can be split into two energetic streams:

(forward energy / escape / fire / willpower)
The Animals – ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", Deep Purple – ""Highway Star"", Deep Purple – ""Child in Time"" (emotion explosion + moral judgment), Talking Heads – ""Pulled Up"", Bob Dylan – ""Hurricane"", Suzi Quatro – ""If You Can’t Give Me Love""


These are all ""pushing"" songs. Their energy rises, moving forward against the odds.They play when characters are in ""push"" mode, not despair.


For example: when Tian-Chen dies, the diner music shifts to an upbeat tempo—this isn’t just entertainment. It’s the ""From"" system trying to balance despair (brutal death) with cheer up (songs that elevate the mood). Of course the target get brutally unmood but Kenny stop crying. 


(inward energy / nostalgia / sadness / surrender)

Gene Pitney – ""Town Without Pity"", Gene Pitney – ""Last Chance to Turn Around"", Johnny Cash – ""Any Old Wind That Blows"", Joni Mitchell – ""Blue"" , Joni Mitchell – ""Both Sides Now"", Tom Waits – ""Ol' '55"", Tom Waits – ""The Piano Has Been Drinking"", Janis Ian – ""At Seventeen""


These are ""dive inward"" songs, filled with regret, nostalgia, reflection, and emotional wounds. They surface when the characters or the town are in a low-energy phase, or fear-energy. The diner serves as an energy barometer for Fromville. If the songs start leaning heavily toward fear, it signals that the town is under collective emotional pressure.


**Thematic Pattern: Escape vs. Fate**

Every song features two overarching themes:

Escape
""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", ""Highway Star"", ""A Trick of the Tail"", ""If I Had a Boat"", ""One More Cup of Coffee"", ""Ol’ ’55""

Escape is a central obsession for the ""From"" system: which characters are trying to break free from their nodes?. Whenever characters in an episode begin discussing hope, plans to leave, or finding an ""out,"" the music joins the soundtrack of that system.

The jukebox literally reacts.


Fate / Inevitable Return
""Que Sera Sera"", ""Town Without Pity"", ""Blue"", ""Both Sides Now"", ""At Seventeen"", ""Stars"", ""Child in Time"" (a song about karmic reckoning)


From a fear perspective, these songs are soothing yet paralyzing. They represent the idea that ""you’re here because your path isn’t complete."" The jukebox becomes a sound divination tool.


The Creepier Pattern: Jukebox Reacts to What the Town Needs, Not What the Characters Choose. There’s a strong clue here. The diner never plays songs that lead people toward panic or chaos. While many rock songs from the '60s and '70s express anger, the creator only selected:


Rock that ignites courage or folk that soothes emotional wounds. Nothing chaotic, Why is that?. Because Fromville (the middle node) needs stability. If characters are too high-energy, the system pulls in fear. If they’re too low, it injects hope/cheer up. It functions like an emotional thermostat.


The Tian-Chen Moment. When Tian-Chen dies, the hope energy drops dramatically. Excess hope can trigger a reset or chaos, so the system plays a celebration song. It projects outward. The song selection isn't random; it aims to prevent the node from falling into despair. Music acts as medicine. When Jim funeral on S4 they should play song themes suit his best. Stay away from family mfers, so audiences crack what this series all about im lost! 


Hidden Connection: Diner = Neutral Node, Tower = hope Node. The diner always serves as a place for: Real conversations, Important information, Mood balancing a space for people to ""rearrange their thoughts.""


The diner sits at the heart of the town—neutral. Its jukebox is also neutral, ""resetting"" characters to a safe position. The creator described it as: ""The diner is the beating heart of Fromville"". It’s literally the emotional heart.


Talking Heads appear twice—this is significant. They are the band most closely associated with music about: Disorientation, Split identity, An absurd world, Humorous paranoia, Glitches in reality. The song ""Psycho Killer"" appears not just for laughs but as a signal from the system: ""Your mind is splitting from the node. Slow down.""


There’s a major pattern that is incredibly consistent: Music serves as a tool for regulating fear and hope. Genres are not random but divided into push (hope) and pull (fear). The diner acts as the emotional balancing node for the town. The tower channels bursts of hope (like the celebration music after Tian-Chen).The songs are used by the system to keep characters on their trajectory within their roles.",3,1765508717.0,FromSeries,2,1.0,False

Hello, dear readers.

This is Tremendous.

After a long and longer time, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation has come to an end.

Truly...

I feel both light and strangely wistful deep in my chest.

While writing this, I think I had fun.

Of course, if someone told me, ""You enjoyed it so much, go back and write it all over again!""

I feel like my mental state would just collapse on the spot.

Anyway...

If I had to write it again, it would be hard, but it really was a story I found joyful and fulfilling.

Especially the self-actualization.

There were so many scenes I thought, ""I absolutely have to write this,"" and...

I was so happy to be able to put those scenes into words.

The thematic core of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation, which I also mentioned in the setting notes I gave to the webtoon artist, is...

""Gratitude for life.""

Not a single thing we enjoy...

Not a ray of sunlight, not a breath of air, not even a single grain of sand, is actually something we're guaranteed to have.

Honestly, the very fact that the planet hasn't been wiped out by a meteor, or that a solar storm hasn't obliterated Earth is itself a miracle.

Each and every detail of us being alive at all is a coincidence and a miracle...

So, I wanted to express gratitude toward this world.

A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation is something created while searching for reasons to be grateful for life.

You can think of the main theme as pondering why we should be grateful for life.

Under the question, ""Why must we be grateful to this thing called life?"" I kept throwing questions at Seo Eun-hyun again and again.

And the answer to that is...

Because there are so many precious chances.

Because time that has passed will never return.

Because even though there are bad connections, good connections undeniably exist as well.

Because the very act of rejoicing, raging, grieving, enjoying, loving, hating, and desiring within life is itself something to be deeply grateful for.

Because there is someone or something we can blame.

And even when there is no such target of blame, the simple act of us incomplete people searching for answers together is itself happiness.

Because life is a miracle.

And maybe, simply...

Just because we can be grateful.

""Because this world is a miracle, everything in it is also a miracle"" is what I wanted to discuss together with you, the readers, through A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

And I think I was happy just to be able to pull so many scenes that discuss ""life is a miracle"" into reality and offer them to you all.

Seo Eun-hyun beheading Makli Hyeon.

Seo Eun-hyun defeating Makli Wangshin and giving his disciples a chance.

Seo Eun-hyun offering thanks beneath the giant tree.

Seo Eun-hyun climbing to Ultimate Pinnacle, breaking through the Heavenly Rejection phenomenon, and reflecting again on the preciousness of connections.

Seo Eun-hyun cutting through the Heavenly Tribulation and rising beneath the heavens alongside the Formless Sword.

Seo Eun-hyun, together with Buk Hyang-hwa, realizing that life is a miracle and letting her go...

And beyond that, Jeon Myeong-hoon, shouting his fury as he witnesses the fall of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.

The elders of Black Ghost Valley sacrificing themselves to protect the Black Ghost Valley that is heading toward ruin because of Kang Min-hee.

Azure Tiger Saint exploding and showing what it means to become a star.

The Mad Lord's Entering Heavens Beyond the Path, Heart of Love.

(Heart of Yeon (然/Nature), Heart of Yeon (緣/Fate), Heart of Yeon (戀/Yearning) all combined into Heart of Yeon (戀/Love)—this is a line I've been dying to write since the early days of the work.)

The scene where Yeon Wei and Hon Won forgive each other, reconcile, and reunite inside a burning mansion.

Seo Hweol's final moments—Goodbye, Daoist Seo...

And also, the Star Genesis Supreme Deity's advancement!

I wanted to write the Star Genesis Supreme Deity's advancement and the Owner of Myriad Stars so badly that every time it felt like A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation itself was speaking to me to the point I wanted to scream...

I remember wanting to write it so intensely I thought I'd lose my mind.

""Star Genesis Supreme Deity, Star Genesis Supreme Deity has to be written.

""Even if the process gets wrecked, at least Star Genesis Supreme Deity no matter what!""

With that kind of madness, I ran all the way here.

It was also fun setting up the villains.

Yuan Li, as the boss that closes out the very first main episode, was a bit difficult.

But wrapping up characters like the Mad Lord, Seo Hweol, and the Great Mountain Supreme Deity was genuinely fun.

Same with Hong Fan.

In a way, the villains are where I projected myself.

So I think I've always ended up rooting for the villains more than Seo Eun-hyun, projecting myself into them, and having them stand against Seo Eun-hyun.

The Mad Lord with his grotesque appearance (the author looks kind of funny too), and Seo Hweol, who controls information so the opponent can never see what's really going on.

Hong Fan, who is still just a young child and soft on the inside...

All the villains who carried A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

They were all me.

Truly...

It's been a long journey.

At the end of it all, I feel like I managed to land the ending well...so a lot of different emotions are hitting me.

I feel proud, a little sad, wistful...

Also refreshed.

Of course...

To be honest, if I'm going to spill some TMI about the ending and everything around it:

In the early stages, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation did not have its settings and details, its ending, or its final boss so clearly defined like they are now.

The setting and ending for A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation were set around the 4th or 5th cycle...

You could say I locked them in while writing around Chapter 25. (\*Of course, not the core theme. The core theme was there from the moment this became an infinite-regression story...)

And if you ask, ""Then what did you mean when you said you prepared it four years ago?""...

What I had back then was the worldbuilding that would form the skeleton of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

Various other settings.

The idea of a protagonist who wields a transparent sword.

The narrative of a protagonist who never gives up and, with a kind of madness, reaches a single goal.

But that protagonist was not 'Seo Eun-hyun'.

I think the first time the world of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation and the protagonist Seo Eun-hyun really got decided as cores of the worldbuilding that would unfold those ideas was...when he beheaded Makli Hyun.

And it was probably when he awakened through his disciples and showed you Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains that the worldbuilding was finally confirmed for good.

""Ah, this is going to work, I can tell. If it's this story, if it's this guy as the protagonist, he can reach the end. In worldbuilding this, I should pour in all the settings I've created, the cast, the growth route I planned for the protagonist...everything.""

And what was completed was the world of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

The original worldbuilding I'd made wasn't something created for any one specific story.

Some of the settings were even things I'd intended to use in a completely different work.

But once I finally had a protagonist who looked like he would never break all the way to the end...

I realized Seo Eun-hyun could shoulder all of these settings and stories.

So I started taking the settings I'd meant to use in other stories and grafting them into the existing world, sticking them on, building the logic to make it all hold together...

And that's why I went on hiatus a lot in the early days.

Early readers will know this: before the series went paid, my release schedule was a total wreck, and I went on week-long breaks, then just dumped chapters on weekends...it was a mess.

Even now, if you look back at the early Munpia release schedule, you can see how chaotic it was.

Part of it is that I'm an avoidant type of person, and I used to be lazy before I got into the groove.

But the reason the schedule was that disastrous was because, at that time, I was doing a massive amount of worldbuilding readjustment and creating the internal story logic.

\*Of course, the April 1st break wasn't an April Fools' joke. My father really did drag me off to Gangwon Province to dig up potatoes, and dragged me all the way out to a potato field at the far end of Gangwon, so I had no choice.

Maybe that's why I ended up writing those scenes where, instead of just leaving potatoes as a small symbol of kindness, I forcibly stuffed them down Hong Fan's throat...maybe that was my grudge showing.

Honestly, because of that potato-digging trip, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation could have been discontinued right there.

Thinking about it again, even I find it ridiculous...

Potatoes are delicious, but that memory is dizzying.

I'd taken the whole week off to align the settings and finish the big plot structure, planning to do a release spree on the weekend—then got hauled off to dig potatoes on that very weekend.

If, at that time, the readers had gotten angry and dropped the series, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation would really have ended right there...

I can only be deeply grateful to those who didn't get angry and didn't remove it from their favorites during the potato-digging incident.

In any case, after that, the lesson ""Right now. This very moment. I don't need some vague hope that might or might not come in the future"" really got carved \[to the bone\] into my heart.

If you drag your feet, you'll be too late.

In the future, you never know when you'll get dragged off to a potato field, or dragged off somewhere else.

I learned very clearly that going on hiatus while making excuses like ""I'll do a release spree later"" can be unbelievably dangerous, and that let me build a supporting theme that completes the main core them.

Anyway, one way or another...

It's true that the early stages of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation had settings that were very different from now, and much to be completed taking those early breaks.

Of course, the idea that the final boss would be related to a black snake, and that this black snake would follow the protagonist from the beginning and finally awaken as the final boss in the end—that narrative itself has been there ever since the fairy tale's appearance.

You could say the major plot of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was almost entirely planned out by around the 6th cycle.

The core theme was there from the very start as well (I'm the type who believes a full-length novel absolutely needs a central theme...though if it's not that long, I do think the story itself can be enough on its own).

The worldbuilding was all settled around chapter 25,

And the plot was more than 80 percent finished before chapter 50 (before the 6th cycle).

But when it comes to character arcs...

Things really, really changed a lot along the way.

Most notably, Salt Sea was changed in the 17th cycle to be the same person as Cheongmun Ryeong.

And the Great Mountain Supreme Deity and Silver Basket were originally the same person.

Silver Basket, who was the Creator God of another world, couldn't stand watching the self-torturing acts of the final boss of the world A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation and that suffocating behavior of trying to run away from the answer, so he was going to invade the world, take the Seat of the Mountain, give advice to Seo Eun-hyun, then pass the seat of the mountain on to Seo Eun-hyun...

I think he was loosely set up as a character that was basically Salt Sea + Great Mountain + Silver Basket mashed into one.

But I thought the Great Mountain Supreme Deity should have an impact as big as his name sounds, so to give him that impact, I went with a development where he completely wipes out the protagonist's party and twisted it into a narrative of conflict between senior brother and junior brother.

So originally, the latter half of the True Immortal Realm wasn't going to be separated from the Audience Chamber arc, and Heuk Sa was supposed to show up as the final boss.

But I ended up splitting it off from the Audience Chamber arc and made the Great Mountain Supreme Deity the final boss of the True Immortal Realm arc.

Also, Heuk Sa was originally actually the same person as the Heavenly Punishment Supreme Deity,

He was also planned to have far less presence than he does now.

The ending I had in mind was that he'd drag himself along in a pathetic, ugly way like Yuan Li, and then be defeated by the protagonist's group.

But after the 6th cycle, I just didn't want to write a final boss who was only pitiful and ugly.

And just as I'd given several character endings that, even to me, felt beautiful...

I worried the story's ending would become too crude, so I borrowed the strength of many characters and completely revised the finale.

If I'd gone with the original idea, then probably...

The ending of the story would have turned out far more vulgar.

Even thinking back on it now, the current ending is much better.

Really...

I think it was a good story.

Calling it a 'dragon's head and a dragon's tail' feels a bit too much, even to me...

It feels more like the head of an imoogi, the body of a snake, and only at the very end did it finally grow a dragon's tail.

Something like mangdu-sache-yongmi (蟒頭蛇體龍尾/python's head, snake's body, dragon's tail) is probably exactly the level A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation sits at.

But well...

In the end, isn't the ending what matters most in a work?

It's a bit awkward to say this with my own mouth, but.

Even I think that for the ending...at least for the ending, I poured my heart and blood into it.

Staying up countless nights, feeling my lifespan get shaved away by coffee and iced americanos with extra shots, unable to even eat three meals a day like a proper human, losing any sense of day or night and just going ""uhhh, ughhh"" while writing in a daze.

Even I think...

It was hard to run all the way here.

And I managed to bring the ending out just the way I'd first envisioned it.

As for the foreshadowing I laid out, I only scattered what I could handle, so I think I picked up almost everything that needed picking up.

If there are any foreshadowing that still haven't been resolved, they'll either be dealt with in the afterword stories, or, if they never get resolved, you can think of them as ""there's a setting like this too""—details that were just there to explain the world.

You can think of them as not even being MacGuffins, not even proper foreshadowing.

Oh, of course, there are real MacGuffins like Old Man Eom of Cheongnan Library, but well...

\[TL/N: Eomcheongnan means Tremendous.\]

What work in this world doesn't have a MacGuffin anyway?

But taking all of that into account,

Even I think!

The ending of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation turned out well!

Huaaaaaaaah!!!

And!!!

I also know very well that none of this was achieved by my strength alone.

Even if I was the one who observed the story,

It was Munpia who helped me tell the world what I observed!

And Raon E&M, who signed a contract with me!

I want to thank Seong-in Hyung, who gave me the very first contact in the form of an ultra-long, incredibly sincere message, and who kept persistently leaving comments on that contact post so that the contract offer notification would keep popping up for me.

You may be at Munpia now, but the title of 'my first ever editor in charge' is yours, Hyung.

In my heart, you'll always be my number one editor.

And CEO Lee Jae-hwan, who has now founded the company Storywave, gave me so many pieces of advice back when he was a division director at Raon E&M—words that were truly like gold and jade.

I think the reason so many people were able to come to A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation through Series might well be thanks to the advice he gave me about the cover.

And on the webtoon side as well, the CEO really ran all over the place and did *so* many things behind the scenes that I think that's why the webtoon could turn out this well.

In my opinion, when it comes to webnovels, the person with the best eye for them is probably the CEO.

I am truly grateful.

I also want to offer very deep thanks to Director Kwak Seong-yong, who became the second editor in charge of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation. I can only feel sorry for all the times I delayed turning in the manuscript because I was trying to increase the length.

Thank you for staying with me over that long year and a half, accompanying me all the way to the ending of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation, for handling the webtoon adaptation so well, and for teaching me so many of the things I was curious about.

I'll of course greet the three of you properly in person, but I'd like to bow my head once more here in advance.

Thank you so much for everything up to now.

And I'd also like to send words of support to Artist Kim Moo-hyun of Haksan Publishing, who is now beginning the webtoon serialization. Once again, thank you for preparing such a wonderful webtoon for nearly two years...and then finally setting it off with a bang.

Every time you drew an episode of the first cycle, you always sent the draft to Raon for checking—that loving care you showed makes me at a loss for how to even express my thanks.

All I can say is that I did my utmost with the original story so that, even if only a few parts are adapted, you can still reach a satisfying conclusion, and I hope that can return at least a small part of my gratitude.

And besides them,

PD Kim Ki-hyun of Munpia.

Back when A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation first got contacted, you were one of the final two competitors along with Seong-in Hyung, so I want to say thank you for always loving A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation that much.

Also, the person who bought me meals the most (including all management, across the board) was PD Kim Ki-hyun, so whenever I think of Munpia now, PD Kim's image is the first thing that comes to mind.

Going forward as well, I'll be in your care for the next work.

In addition to them, Raon E&M's CEO, Author Song Hyun-woo, and many other editors and staff.

Munpia CEO Son Je-ho, the Munpia martial arts-fantasy team lead and division head, and even the part lead who handed me a business card at the neighboring seat yesterday—thank you all so much.

And to the person in charge of uploading to Series, though we've never met even once, my thanks to you as well.

To all the many people who had a hard time because of me every time, I offer my deepest thanks.

To illustrator mucuzi, who drew the first cover and illustrations.

To illustrator Seril (세릴), who drew the second and third covers and illustrations.

To illustrator failose, who drew the character illustrations.

To all of you, I bow my head in gratitude.

The illustrators helped immensely in conveying the images of the characters of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation to the readers.

And lastly, illustrator failose (실패배), really...

I want to thank you for gifting me with an unbelievable quantity of absolutely incredible fanart.

True to your nickname, you're the Taenghwa Heavenly Venerable.

Thank you.

Beyond those illustrators, countless other illustrators drew fanart of the characters of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

I can only be so, so, so thankful that you chose to display such golden-handed skill here, on this work...

I have nothing I can dare offer all of you except the words: Thank you so much.""

No matter how much a writer is the one who observes the story and brings the tale into reality...

The number one reason A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was able to come this far is because the readers were there.

I was able to serialize it because there was a platform.

I was able to monetize it because of the management.

And I think it became known because of the illustrators and the golden hands of so many people.

Thank you, and thank you again.

Thanks to everyone, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was able to come into the world.

Thank you.

And with the 25-year commemorative Tremendous author-avatar comic drawn by illustrator failose, I'll offer my thanks and bring this to a close.

Someday, a few epilogues and side stories will go up.

And we'll meet again—also someday, perhaps—in the next work that might come.

The first time was with a signature. Ink bled into paper. A name curled itself into permanence. Somewhere far away, a process began humming like a quiet machine with no off switch. He felt nothing then. Relief, maybe. The sterile relief of a job closed.

The second time came later, when the man knocked.

Not pounded. Knocked. Civil. Almost apologetic.

He did not answer at first. He stood in the kitchen, holding a glass he had forgotten to fill, counting breaths he did not need to count. The knock repeated. Same rhythm. Same restraint. Whoever stood on the other side knew patience and how to weaponize it.

When he opened the door, the man smiled with the lower half of his face only.

“You look disappointed,” the man said. “Everyone does.”

“You’re dead,” he replied.

“So are you,” the man said gently, and stepped inside.

This was not how hauntings were supposed to work. No rattling chains. No cold drafts. No remorse dripping from the walls. The man wore a creased gray coat and smelled faintly of antiseptic and rain. He took in the apartment with an appraiser’s eye, cataloging guilt by square footage.

“You signed my exit,” the man continued. “You know the clause. Once the wheel turns, it keeps turning.”

“I can fix it,” he said. A reflex. The lie leapt out fully clothed.

The man laughed. It was a brief sound, aborted, as if laughter itself had learned better. “Everyone says that too.”

They sat. Coffee appeared. He could not remember making it. The man drank without fear. Dead men, it turned out, were reckless with heat.

“You were thorough,” the man said. “That’s why they liked you. Clean hands. Clean conscience. You never asked where the people went, only whether the forms were complete.”

“I saved lives,” he said.

“Statistically,” the man agreed. “Individually, you erased us. We became rounding errors with biographies.”

The room contracted. The walls leaned in like eavesdroppers. He felt something return to him then. Not guilt. Recognition.

“You’re here for revenge,” he said.

“No,” the man replied. “Revenge is linear. This is recursive.”

The word rang. Recursive. A snake devouring its logic.

The man placed a small object on the table. Curved. Wooden. Smooth with use.

“A boomerang,” he said. “From my son. He loved physics. Action, reaction. Throw it right and it comes home.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will.”

The man stood. The air thickened, as if memory had mass. “I was told you were careful. Ethical. I was told you believed in systems.”

“I do,” he said. Too quickly.

“Good,” the man said. “Then you’ll appreciate the elegance.”

The man left. No smoke. No fanfare. Just absence, like a sentence cut short by a censor who knew where to strike.

The next morning, the news broke wrong.

Names misaligned with faces. Dates slid. Causes contradicted themselves. A woman declared alive sued her own estate. A man pronounced dead applied for a mortgage. The system hiccupped. Then convulsed.

He watched it spread from his desk, from his screen, from the secure network that had once felt like a cathedral. Flags bloomed red. Audits screamed. The algorithms, his proud children, began feeding on their own assumptions.

He tried to intervene. Overrides failed. Permissions rebounded. Every fix snapped back with interest, correcting him instead. He deleted a line of code. It reappeared elsewhere, annotated in his own voice.

Recursive.

At noon, security arrived. Polite. Apologetic. They escorted him out of the building he had helped design to keep people out.

“You authorized the initial parameters,” they said. “The cascade traces to your credentials.”

“That’s impossible.”

“It’s inevitable,” the guard said, and did not smile.

At home, the boomerang waited on the table.

He picked it up. It was warm. He threw it across the room in frustration, a childish, useless act. It vanished midair.

A moment later, it struck him between the shoulders.

Pain flared. Breath fled. He collapsed, laughing and choking at once. Blood spotted the floor in small, precise commas.

The phone rang.

He crawled. Answered.

The man’s voice flowed through the line, rich with static. “You see now. The system did exactly what it was built to do. It optimized. It corrected. It came back.”

“You broke it,” he gasped.

“No,” the man said. “I aimed it.”

Silence followed. Not empty silence. Weighted silence. The kind that waits.

As darkness crept in, he understood the final cruelty. There would be no villain to prosecute, no ghost to banish. Only processes, faithfully executing intent long after intent had fled.

His last thought was not fear.

It was admiration.

The boomerang, after all, never misses.

1pkgt88,https://www.reddit.com/r/SevSide7/comments/1pkgt88/5_grounding_techniques_that_actually_help_when/,5 Grounding Techniques That Actually Help When Anxiety Takes Over,"Hey everyone,



I wanted to share something that's helped me tremendously during my healing journey. We all know that feeling when anxiety hits out of nowhere - your heart races, your thoughts spiral, and you feel completely disconnected from reality. Over the years, I've learned that grounding techniques can be absolute lifesavers in these moments.



These aren't just random tips I found online. These are techniques I've personally used during panic attacks, flashbacks, and those overwhelming moments when trauma tries to pull me under. I hope they help you too.



\*\*1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Technique\*\*



This is my go-to when I'm spiraling. It forces your brain to focus on the present moment instead of the anxiety.



\- \*\*5 things you can SEE\*\*: Look around and name them out loud or in your head. ""I see my blue coffee mug, the tree outside my window, my phone, the crack in the ceiling, my shoes.""

\- \*\*4 things you can TOUCH\*\*: Actually touch them. Feel the texture of your jeans, the cool surface of your desk, the softness of your hair, the smooth screen of your phone.

\- \*\*3 things you can HEAR\*\*: Close your eyes if it helps. The hum of the refrigerator, cars passing outside, your own breathing.

\- \*\*2 things you can SMELL\*\*: This one's tricky sometimes. Your shirt, hand lotion, coffee, even just the air.

\- \*\*1 thing you can TASTE\*\*: Drink some water, chew gum, or just notice the taste in your mouth.



The beauty of this technique is that it completely interrupts the anxiety spiral. Your brain can't focus on catastrophic thoughts AND sensory details at the same time.



\*\*2. Cold Water Shock (The Dive Reflex)\*\*



This sounds weird, but it's backed by science. When you're in fight-or-flight mode, your body needs a physiological reset.



\- Splash ice-cold water on your face

\- Hold an ice cube in your hand

\- Run cold water over your wrists

\- If you're really overwhelmed, take a cold shower



The cold triggers something called the ""dive reflex"" - it actually slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system. I keep a bowl of ice water in my freezer for emergencies. It sounds dramatic, but it works when nothing else does.



\*\*3. The 4-7-8 Breathing Method\*\*



When we're anxious, we breathe shallow and fast, which makes everything worse. This technique forces you to breathe properly:



\- Breathe IN through your nose for 4 seconds

\- HOLD your breath for 7 seconds

\- Breathe OUT through your mouth for 8 seconds

\- Repeat 4-5 times



The long exhale is key - it activates your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""rest and digest"" system). I was skeptical about breathing exercises for years, but this one genuinely works. Sometimes I do it in public and no one even notices.



\*\*4. Physical Grounding Through Movement\*\*



Sometimes you need to move the anxiety OUT of your body:



\- Stomp your feet on the ground (really feel the floor)

\- Squeeze and release your fists 10 times

\- Do wall push-ups or jumping jacks

\- Stretch your body - reach for the ceiling, touch your toes

\- Dance aggressively to loud music (my personal favorite)



Trauma gets trapped in our bodies. Moving helps release it. I've cried during stretching sessions before because my body was finally letting go of tension I didn't even know I was holding.



\*\*5. The ""Safe Place"" Visualization\*\*



When reality feels too overwhelming, your mind needs somewhere safe to go:



\- Close your eyes and picture a place where you feel completely safe (real or imaginary)

\- Engage all your senses: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel?

\- Spend 2-3 minutes there in your mind

\- Describe it out loud if you're alone



Mine is a cabin by a lake at sunset. I can see the orange sky reflected on the water, hear birds chirping, feel the warm breeze. I've ""gone there"" hundreds of times when panic attacks hit. Your brain doesn't fully know the difference between imagination and reality - use that to your advantage.



\*\*Important Reminders:\*\*



✨ These techniques work BETTER with practice. Try them when you're calm so your brain remembers them during crisis.



✨ Not every technique works for everyone. That's okay. Find YOUR favorites.



✨ Grounding techniques are tools, not cures. They help you survive the moment, but healing takes time and often professional support.



✨ Be patient with yourself. Some days these will work perfectly. Other days they won't. That doesn't mean YOU failed.



Trauma recovery isn't linear. Some days you'll use all five techniques. Other days you won't need any. Both are okay. You're doing better than you think you are.



What grounding techniques work for you? I'd love to hear what helps others in this community. We're all learning together.

It’s not rejection. It’s not approval. It’s this weird vacuum where all your optimism goes to die.

For years I treated that line like a checkpoint.
I’d end the call feeling good, pour a coffee, crack my knuckles, and start building some masterpiece of a document nobody explicitly asked for.
Hours of formatting, rewriting, polishing… like the buyer was waiting breathlessly for my PDF to land in their inbox.

But the part that burns into my memory isn’t the writing.
It’s the way I used to sit there afterward — refreshing my inbox like a dog staring at the door, convinced someone was about to walk in.

I’d blame the proposal.
Too long? Too short? Did I sound desperate? Too technical? Not technical enough?
Then I’d blame the buyer.
Why can’t they just say no? Why vanish?

It took me an embarrassingly long time to understand the thing every experienced seller knows deep down:
the deal was never real.
I was talking to someone who enjoyed the conversation but wasn’t close to a decision.
And “send me a proposal” was just the politest possible exit from a meeting they didn’t want to fight me on.

The ones who actually buy don’t end with homework for you.
They drag people into the room.
They ask who signs.
They talk about deadlines and consequences.
They create motion.

“Send me a proposal” creates… nothing.

The worst instance?
A guy sounded genuinely thrilled, borderline emotional about our solution.
I stayed up half the night writing the doc.
Sent it at 8:03 a.m.
By noon I’d refreshed my inbox so many times my laptop fan sounded like it was going to take off.

Two weeks later I understood his enthusiasm wasn’t about buying anything.
It was about ending the call without disappointing me.

There’s a kind of professional heartbreak that only happens once — the moment you realize you weren’t ghosted at all.
You just insisted on believing a deal was alive because you needed it to be.

These days, when someone asks for a proposal, I don’t celebrate.
I say, “What actually happens on your side after you read it?”
If they can’t answer that clearly, I stop pretending the deal is real.

I love having my dog with me, and due to her being a puppy, I haven't been leaving her home alone.

Any suggestions for community spaces that encourage or allow dogs?

I enjoy restaurants / bars such as Potchke, Fin-Two, Bida Saigon, Remedy Coffee, and Tern Club (yes, I am usually pretty boring and routine driven). I frequent Central Cinema, McKays, and Lost and Found Records. I tend to stay Knoxville bound, visiting Seven Islands, Big Ridge, the Smokies, and the Ocoee. I spend a lot of time at the park.

That is pretty much my whole spiel, and I appreciate any suggestions towards places that I could hang out with my dog. We have been bearing the cold, but she is a whippet and pretty intolerant of this weather! Thank you.

1pkgo1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pkgo1a/my_23m_gf_22f_witnessed_me_have_an_emotional/,My (23M) GF (22F) Witnessed me have an emotional breakdown and went to her parent's the next day. How do I move forward from here?,"Hello, This is my first time posting on Reddit and I have a lot of context to get through so stick with me. I, Tyler (23M), and my girlfriend, Grace (22F), have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for almost 1 year. (names are changed for privacy) .This will be long so TLDR will be at the end if you want to scroll all the way down. However, This story requires the context so I would encourage you to read through. Some context that will come back up throughout the story is that I work a 3rd shift job that is very mentally taxing due to the workplace and nature of the work. Grace works a 1st shift job that is physically taxing and mentally taxing due to the workplace being toxic.

Last Night me and my girlfriend Grace had one of the biggest and definitely loudest argument that we have ever had that ended with me having an emotional breakdown where I was crying and losing it a little. The main reasons for the argument are doing chores around the apartment and overall stress on the relationship.

To start, when Me and Grace moved in together we agreed on assigned chores for each other and what we expected from each other living together. My assigned chores: Dinner, Dishes, Trash, and overall pickup. Should be noted that as part of Dinner and Dishes I end up doing all of the kitchen area cleanup/pickup as well. Grace's assigned chores: Laundry, Vacuum/Mop Floors and overall pickup. This is imbalanced from the beginning but I volunteered to do the dishes and trash because when Grace lived alone and I would come over; Her dishes stacked up so much mold began to grow on things, and trash sat so long without getting taken out that small gnats/flies were producing and flying around the trash can. I was worried about these habits before moving in together but I figured If I handled these specific tasks it would be ok. I volunteered to handle dinner because I knew she wouldn't want to or be able to cook after getting home from work and I liked and knew how to cook more things than here.

The first month or two went fairly smooth and we were doing what we each agreed to do. Grace wouldn't pick up a thing here or there but I didn't mind because It took 5 seconds to clean or throw away. But as time passed and we lived together longer Grace began to neglect her chores and not picking up after herself became a more frequent occurrence. Again I wouldn't really say anything about not picking up because I still didn't mind and I wasn't perfect about it either even though I did eventually have to pickup after myself because if I didn't do it then it wouldn't happen. I would mention the floors and laundry not being done here and there but never a serious conversation about it because Grace was always tired and stressed from work and a conversation would lead to what she doesn't like that I do and her crying and having a breakdown. However, recently Grace doing her chores has become a bigger issue and that's partially because she really wasn't doing them but also partially because my patience over time has grown thinner.

The reason my patience had grown thinner isn't just time it's because that while Grace had been doing her chores less often. I have been doing more chores and extra things. On top of making or buying dinner almost every night (Grace would cook dinner once or once every other week) I also started making Grace breakfast in the mornings after I would get home from work. I volunteered to do this at the time because Grace was getting breakfast/coffee at McDonald's every morning or really most of the time I was buying it for her or us. I realized how much money that is over an extended period of time so I presented options for Grace to do at home and she wasn't keen on anything that didn't have to be cooked. I volunteered to do this because I felt it was a supportive thing to do, I liked cooking and I was saving her and me money. I also was vacuuming when it got bad and she wasn't doing it and cleaning the toilets when I noticed they were dirty. I realize that a lot of these things I volunteered to do but I was doing it for what I thought were the right reasons. And again I know I should have had more conversations with her but I was worried about her mental health and her feeling like I was micro managing her and constantly nagging.

Now as I said recently Grace's issues with neglecting her chores and not picking up after herself has become a bigger issue and there is a primary reason for that. For the past 4-5 months maybe longer she has been playing Minecraft online on a server against other people but recently she started talking to people while playing through Discord and the Discord for the Minecraft server. This has led to what I see as an unhealthy obsession. Grace comes home and takes a bath/shower and immediately gets on the game, when she lays down to go to bed she stays in the voice call and watches people stream their game on discord. And when she first started talking to people she ruined her sleep schedule by staying up till 5 am gaming which she said was ok because it was the weekend but then on the weekdays she still stayed up till 2-3 am gaming when she needed to wake up at 6-7 am. I recognized that she was having fun and even though we weren't interacting almost at all I understood that it was most likely a temporary obsession. There were some tense moments where she thought I was upset about it but we talked it through and the obsession did resolve over the next week or two she was still playing it and talking to people every day. This new obsession is what I believe made her already bad habits with chores even worse.

The last bit of context I want to add is that a different primary stressor that has been in Grace's and I's relationship even before we moved in together was the Work Shift difference between her and I. When we first started dating and for the first year and a half we were both on first shift. But when I was going to finish my degree I had to find a ""field-study"" (co-op, apprenticeship) In my field as a requirement to graduate. The only job I could find was on 3rd shift so therefore I took it and switched to 3rd shift. This was fine at first but It has caused issues throughout our relationship here and there and Grace has asked me to find a 1st shift job a few times now and I do want to get off of 3rd shift. The problem is that as we all know the job market is currently awful and I've applied to 100+ jobs but haven't even gotten an interview or meaningful reply back. It doesn't help that my field limits my options and I'm only living slightly above paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to not work for even a month. Therefore my only options are to try and get a job that I have personal hang-ups about that would require some lifestyle changes, or stay with my current job and keep applying for jobs.

**So with all of this context we can get into the Fight itself last night and the current situation.** A few days ago I was looking for a shirt and opened the washer/dryer to try and find it. When I opened the washer there were clothes in there that were damp and smelled really bad and I asked Grace how long they had been there. She said something around a couple of day's or something to that effect and I was annoyed but I was getting ready for work and dropped it. 20-30 minutes later I was leaving for work and I grabbed the trash out of the can and went to leave, she was playing Minecraft talking to people and I tried to get her attention multiple times so I could say bye like we usually do, but she was in the middle of a game and didn't notice so I left without saying bye. That night turned out pretty bad for me: late for work, super busy at work, didn't get to say bye, etc. So I texted Grace and told her we needed to have a conversation about chores and doing stuff around the apartment. She doesn't reply and I come home from work to her still gaming at 5 am, it was the weekend but a week or so after we had our conversation about the gaming. On top of this, we had gone grocery shopping that day and I put away the frozen or refrigerated stuff and left the dry stuff on the counter and the trash can had no bag in it because I took it out when I left for work, when I came home the groceries were still on the counter and she couldn't put a bag in the trash can for me either. I go to the spare room and close the door, she goes to the bedroom and sleeps for a few hours. When she wakes up she says ""lets talk"", I do my best to calm down and we have what I feel like is a productive, healthy conversation when she understands where I'm coming from and says she will be better. The day after: leaves a granola bar wrapper and a small piece of it on the coffee table, I throw it away and just snicker to myself. 2nd day after: she leaves her dinner plate with food on it on the coffee table, I throw it away and tell her about the granola wrapper and dinner plate in a half joking away and she understands and laughs about it. 3rd day after: I go to do a small load of my laundry that I need for stuff I wear frequently, I open the washer and their are damp clothes in the washer that smell bad and now I'm pissed. I text her while she's at work that I'm upset and we can talk about it later but that I hope she still has a good day and that I love her. She says I have every right to be upset and apologizes and we leave it there. That day I end up sleeping late and when I wake up she Is gaming and talking to someone. I give it 15-20 min and then ask if she can mute and I try to start the conversation, she mostly blows me off and then goes back to talking to them. I am frustrated/pissed and start half throwing dishes around that were drying and go to the spare room. She comes in and says ""do you hate me"" and from there we get into talking and it starts ok but it escalates when she starts to blame me for things I don't do and it turns into a yelling match. Admittedly, while she yelled first I definitely yelled more and louder. It ends and I go to the spare room and start crying, I never cry, and she comes in and tries to console me which kinda helps but also makes me more upset because she's who I'm upset at but I do love her and just want everything to be ok. I then start half-yelling half-crying and have an emotional breakdown. I then have to go to work and we say bye and that we love each other and I go to work. I come home the next morning, she gets up earlier than usual because she's going to work early and gets herself breakfast. When I wake up I have a text from her that, ""she's not doing ok mentally, she's taking a break and staying at her dads, she's not happy with the conversation or how she was spoken to, and she knows I'm not doing ok mentally but she can't be my support system right now"". Mind you during my breakdown I literally said I feel like I'm everybody's rock mental health wise and nobody is my rock.

Some quick additional context is that Yes, I am dealing with a lot outside of my relationship issues as well. My mom has had a lot of physical health struggles over the past few years that almost cost her life and is now having mental health struggles. My dad has been struggling with mental health for a while but only alludes to it and him and my sister have cut each other off so I am his main support system. There is also a current ordeal with my little half-brother and his mom (different moms) trying to get custody of him after not having custody for 5 years.

My main Issue now is that I feel like I want to be done with this relationship, but I still love her and love the memories we have together. And she does have so many good qualities that are rare and I'm worried I wont find someone with those qualities again. We live together and still have 4 months on the lease. And while this may sound arrogant I know that her being with me has stabilized her financially and mental health wise and I'm worried if I end it she wont recover. And she has helped my mental health in a lot of ways and helped me become a better person in a lot of ways as well. I just don't know how I can be with someone and think about building a future with them when In a time of personal crisis they leave and say, ""they can't be my support system"".

So that's mostly all of it, I know that was a lot, Thank you to anyone who reads this and can offer me advice. I just don't know how I should move forward from here.

**TLDR: Me and my Girlfriend got into a fight about chores after recent issues. She saw me have an emotional breakdown and the next day went to her parent's and said ""she can't be my support system"". How do I move forward.**",0,1765507596.0,relationships,4,0.4,False
1pkgmn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pkgmn4/forget_looksmaxxing_heres_how_to_get_disgustingly/,Forget looksmaxxing. Here’s how to get “disgustingly educated” instead (science-based brain glow-up guide),"A pattern I’ve been seeing lately: Gen Z is obsessed with glow-ups, but exclusively physical ones. Scrolling through TikTok, you’ll find 5-inches-taller shoe hacks, jawline exercises, “looksmaxxing” tutorials, and jaw-dropping “ugly to hot” transformations. But almost no one’s talking about intellectual glow-ups. When did it become cool to prioritize bone structure over brain structure?

This isn’t a call-out post. It’s not your fault. We live in a social media culture that trains us to chase surface-level upgrades. The algorithm rewards aesthetics, not intellect. But the truth is, your level of education is what makes you actually powerful, desirable, and respected.

I’ve gone down a bunch of research rabbit holes, watched the smartest YouTubers, read deep books, and listened to top psychology pods. And no, the answer isn’t a new skincare routine or going viral for a hot gym pic. If you want real status. Real confidence. Real agency. You need to read more. Grow sharper. Think clearer. Learning is the real flex, and I’ve compiled the best ways to start your intellectual glow-up in 2025 and beyond.

Here’s your ultimate guide to becoming “disgustingly educated” (yes, even if school bored you to death).

---

- **First, understand why self-education is your biggest unlock**
  - *A 2016 Pew Research study* found that adults who engage in continuous self-learning report higher confidence, income levels, and social status. Not school. Self-education.
  - *Harvard Business Review* points out that the job market increasingly values “learning agility” which is your ability to absorb and apply new knowledge fast over degrees.
  - According to *The Brookings Institute*, individuals who read regularly and engage with deep material show greater long-term cognitive resilience, especially in digital attention economies.

So yeah, no one’s coming to teach you. But if you learn how to teach yourself, you instantly become more powerful than 99% of people chasing superficial upgrades.

---

- **Best books for immediate brain glow-up**  
  These aren’t dusty textbooks. These are wildly entertaining, research-backed, and life-altering. Each one rewires how you think.

  - **The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli**  
    Over 3 million copies sold. A global bestseller that breaks down the dumb logical traps you fall into every day (yes, even if you're smart). Dobelli’s background in cognitive science makes every page hit hard. This book will make you spot BS instantly, including your own.

  - **Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life by Luke Burgis**  
    This book will make you question everything you think you want. Based on René Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, Burgis explains why your goals might not even be yours. Endorsed by psychology researchers and startup founders alike. Insanely good read if you’ve ever felt lost or directionless.

  - **Range by David Epstein**  
    Subtitled “Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.” Epstein demolished the myth that you have to niche down early to succeed. Backed by case studies from Nobel laureates to athletes. Will make you feel smarter just by understanding it. Genuinely the best book I’ve ever read about intellectual versatility.

---

- **Apps that boost your learning speed & retention (no, not Blinkist)**
  - **Readwise**  
    This app connects to your Kindle, Instapaper, Twitter, articles, tweets, and lets you resurface old highlights in spaced repetition-style emails. It's like building a second brain without realizing it. Retention cheat code.

  - **BeFreed**  
    An AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University and ex-Google engineers. BeFreed generates personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals whether you're trying to improve social intelligence or master a niche topic. You can customize the length and depth of each episode (from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives) and even choose the voice that suits your vibe (sarcastic, soothing, etc). Content is pulled from high-quality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and best-selling books. 

    It basically replaces doomscrolling with structured, science-backed knowledge. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

  - **Tana or Notion (with AI add-ons)**  
    If you're into organizing thoughts, both of these apps let you build a knowledge system with tags, backlinks, and logic flows. Add AI bots like gpt-4 inside to summarize your journal or generate insights from your notes. Learning becomes interactive.

  - **Speechify**  
    For ADHD brains or people who hate reading: Speechify turns any document, article, or PDF into an audiobook with humanlike voices. Makes commuting or gym time 10x more productive. A favorite hack among med students and lawyers who have to read fast.

---

- **Podcasts that’ll make your brain feel like it went to grad school**
  - **Modern Wisdom (Chris Williamson)**  
    He interviews PhDs, athletes, philosophers, and billionaires on everything from dating psychology to AI ethics to masculinity. Somehow makes you feel smarter without being boring. His episodes on attention and dopamine cycles are must-listens.

  - **Big Think**  
    Bite-sized interviews with global experts. Topics range from cognitive bias to futureproofing your skillset. Feels like TED Talks with less fluff. Especially helpful for people who like deep ideas in short time.

  - **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
    Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks down the biology of focus, motivation, and learning. Backed by citations, but somehow still digestible. Episodes like ""How to Learn Faster"" and ""Rewiring Dopamine"" should be required listening.

---

- **YouTube channels that actually teach you to think better**
  - **Ali Abdaal**  
    Former doctor turned productivity nerd. His videos give you systems for learning, memory hacks, and how to make studying suck less. His “evidence-based study techniques” series is gold.

  - **Veritasium**  
    Run by physicist Derek Muller. Explains paradoxes and scientific truths in a way that blows your mind. Each video feels like a mini documentary. Perfect for curious minds who want critical thinking with fun visuals.

  - **Tom Nicholas**  
    Breaks down philosophy, economics, and cultural theory using real-world pop culture examples. Watched his breakdown of late-stage capitalism using Squid Game references and haven’t stopped thinking about it since.

---

- **Bonus: building a habit that sticks**
  - Don’t aim to “read more.” Trick your brain: aim to open a book every day for 5 minutes. That’s it. Once the book is open, you’ll likely keep going.
  - Use the *“cue, craving, response, reward”* habit loop from James Clear’s Atomic Habits. For example:
    - Cue: morning coffee.
    - Craving: dopamine hit from story or insight.
    - Response: read 3 pages.
    - Reward: feel smarter before 10am.
  - Stack reading with something habitual. Ex: read while stretching, eating, or waiting for your subway. Brains love routines.

Real talk, the hottest people I know? Aren’t the tallest. They’re the ones who walk into a room and start referencing a podcast that changed their worldview or a book that made them switch careers. They don’t chase clout. They chase clarity. And people are drawn to that.

I’m JTC - a performer and playlist curator who’s slightly too obsessed with sequencing, flow, and crafting playlists that feel like a whole mood from start to finish.

I update my playlists every week across Spotify & Apple Music, and I curate across a bunch of spaces:

• Electric Soul (bounce, groove, alt R&B & crisp production)

• Coffee & Chill (acoustic, warm, soft start mornings)

• House & Groove (dance without the heavy EDM edge)

• Indie Breeze, Throwback R&B, Gym Mix and a heap more

I’m always looking for new artists, undiscovered gems, and tracks that match a specific emotional or atmospheric “feel.”

1pkgl86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pkgl86/husband_unemployed/,Husband unemployed,"My husband (27) and I (28) have been together for 8 years. We met right after high school and with 2 months dating we started living together, both bc of family issues. Right at that time both of us would receive money from our parents, he would do some design freelancing jobs and I used to babysit, we paid the bills together (since the beginning we had joined accounts) and I would do most of the house work, everything I ask him he does but he’s not the type of person that see something and do it from his own mind (besides things like taking out the trash or putting the plates on the sink, basic stuff only). We moved together to the city I was born in (where I grow up) lived a bit with a family member, they started fighting and he went to spent some time with his family (2 years of relationship and both still working as freelancers / studing), we stayed 3/4 months apart and then I got a pretty good job that would give me a fixed income so he came back and we rented an apartment, after that we lived normally we had our issue like house cleaning divisions but nothing serious, after Covid my area got pretty well paid and I started receiving a lot of money, then he stopped working because he didn’t wanted to work overtime (he did around 50/60h per week) cause artists are treated really bad and get bad payment. After that he started “helping” more at home but I felt like he would compare yourselves too much as if my high paid salary would make his time not worth working for a bad payment company, he starts having less sex, he started gaining weight and he used to LOVE sports. We stayed like this for + 2y, then my job required me to do a 2 month training (to improve my English) and during that time I could pay for stuff for him so he got a job payed off his stuff, I stayed +1 month there and I got very depressed there, I was sad that I didn’t had his company and when some girls from work would ask me to go out and someone would hit on me or compliment me I would get super ashamed and he said that he didn’t cared, and even if I wanted an open relationship if that would make me happy he would, but I never wanted that, I wanted to feel loved, desired and appreciated by him. So I spent most of my time there studying, working. When I got back my salary went even higher and we moved to a bigger house, I started to feel super overwhelmed because I was working and doing most of the cleaning (we got 1 person to help), I have no idea what he did for this past 3 years, he said he studied, I paid for the best mentorship’s on the area, then he said he wanted to start doing miniatures to print and sell, I bought the 3d printing and all, it got left in a corner for 1 year he said it was too problematic and too hard to setup. After 4 years of this I said I wanted to move to a smaller place (like a 2 bed apartment) cause I was not able to jiggle all my day tasks anymore, our days we do stuff together (watch movies, play) but barely have sex, we travel a lot too. So we bought the apartment, I did basically the whole renovation by myself, from choosing stuff, to going there to buy, hiring contractors etc
When I complain about it he always say he didn’t wanted to renovate but the place had mold, infiltration and all the wood was eaten up. Me and his cousin cleaned up entirely by ourselves 1 day before moving he was here but cleaned like 1 window and washed 1 bathroom while we were moving things, removing the renovation left overs. I had a big discussion, saying I couldn’t take this anymore, and kind of gave him an ultimatum. He said he was feeling lost and depressed, I asked him to do therapy he did for a while (like 3,4 months), I bought a new 3d printer, he started using and putting his ideas to paper. Now it’s been around 3 months that he had the initial idea, didn’t finished that one, we ended up buying patreon to paint and sell, he prepare and do all the printing and I paint everything, so now I have 2 jobs. He says he was more ideias, but sometimes he says it’s not the time bc he needs more money, the market I work in is really bad right now I’m afraid to loose my job, my manager is horrible and harasses me (mentally) daily, I cry every day, he says quit and we can loan money from the bank and declare bankruptcy, but I’ve worked so hard for 7 fucking years, I don’t want to take the “easy” route. So now I don’t know what to do, he was starting to have health issues like high colesterol, diabetes, and the doctor prescribed him medication for loosing weight. But he doesn’t workout or eat healthy, and now we’re hitting the 8 years mark, he doesn’t complain, he doesn’t fight, sometimes I even question myself if I’m just the type of person that is unhappy with everything, he treats me nice, sometimes he brings me coffee while I’m on meetings we have fun together, he keeps saying he wants to have kids, but we don’t have sex, I don’t feel like he’s helping over the house and I’m exhausted of keeping up all the bills by myself.",3,1765507363.0,Marriage,6,1.0,False

Been thinking a lot lately about what truly makes a difference in feeling not just *okay*, but genuinely *great* – both in terms of how much we get done and how much we *enjoy* doing it. It's not about drastic overhauls, but about those little, consistent shifts.

Here's what I've found to be my ""secret sauce"" lately. It’s less about a magic bullet and more about building a robust, joyful foundation:

*   **The Power of the ""Micro-Win""**: Instead of aiming for massive achievements that can feel overwhelming, I focus on tiny, achievable wins throughout the day. Waking up 15 minutes earlier? Done. Drinking a full glass of water before coffee? Nailed it. Reading one page of a book? Check. These small victories build momentum and a sense of accomplishment that fuels bigger things.

*   **Mindful Movement, Not Just Exercise**: It’s not always about hitting the gym hard. Sometimes, it’s a 10-minute walk outside, stretching while the kettle boils, or dancing to a favorite song for a few minutes. It’s about *connecting* with your body and releasing that pent-up energy, which has a huge impact on mental clarity and mood.

*   **The ""Three Good Things"" Reflection**: Before bed, I jot down (or just mentally note) three things that went well that day, no matter how small. It could be a funny conversation, a delicious meal, or even just a moment of quiet. This rewires your brain to actively look for the positive, which is a game-changer for overall happiness.

*   **Intentional Downtime**: This is HUGE for productivity. Instead of endlessly scrolling, I schedule short bursts of *actual* rest. A 15-minute meditation, listening to a podcast with my eyes closed, or just staring out the window. It’s not laziness; it’s essential for recharging and preventing burnout.

*   **Embracing Imperfection**: This one's a toughie, but so freeing. Realizing that not everything needs to be perfect. Sometimes ""good enough"" is truly enough. This frees up so much mental energy that was previously spent on striving for an unattainable ideal.

These aren't earth-shattering revelations, but applying them consistently has made a remarkable difference for me. It’s about being intentional with our time and energy, and recognizing that joy and productivity aren't mutually exclusive – they actually fuel each other.

If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or need a little extra support navigating these things, I’ve found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly helpful.

1pkggy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Puzzled_Dirt7674/comments/1pkggy6/soldier_roll/,Soldier Roll," The Soldier Roll
At Warhorse we were limited to things to do with our evening when everything was going well, no incoming, no mass casualties to contend with and clean up afterward. We did have some forms of internment, Green Beans coffee shop (so much better than Starbucks) maybe the gym if you were into that kind of thing but at that time, I was more interested in the fresh baked goods at the DFAC than anything else.
Our PAX Terminal (passenger terminal) was unique because it used to be an old Airport for Saddam’s kids Uday and Qusay with runways, a large hanger and other buildings you would find at any another dictator’s spoiled children’s private airport.
During the early days of the FOB the PAX was nothing more than a Military green canvas tent with plywood floors, a counter with military and civilians working as flight OPS to show your CDC card too and sign in or out dependent on your coming or goings, chairs of various types either repurposed from the DFAC (stolen) and assortment of canvas folding chairs that someone tossed out or left behind during a RIP/TOA (relief in place/transfer of authority) or even rescued from a dumpster by a recreational dumpster diver looking for treasure of DVD’s, porn in any venue, backpacks and other useful items to make life just a little more bearable. It should have been an Olympic sport I would have been a contender in. Let’s see we got just a little off track there, oh yea, there was always a TV with a never- ending supply of Haji bootleg movies donated by people that could stay for hours or even days in this tent if they became orphaned during transient movement from one FOB to the other of which happened often, believe me. You would walk into this oasis of air conditioning and sign in, weigh your bags and then yourself before being told to get comfortable, water is in the refrigerator or freezer because they were rarely frozen from the constant traffic through the PAX. The Golden rule throughout Iraq was take one out replace it with a room temp bottle for the next guy or gal. If no water was inside the tent, then you would march out to the pallet or two outside of the T-Walls that surrounded the place. You would grab one or two packs of water and bring them back inside to start cooling off and perhaps find favor with the PAX personal and not get bumped from your flight, snacks were sometimes provided and maybe a box
of MRE’s that were heavenly picked over because all the bags had been opened and the Skittles, vegetable crackers, peanut butter and jalapeno cheese was missing, no joy there boys and girls.
Now out of sheer boredom and just a little sadistic thinking the Soldier Roll was introduced, but I’ll have to admit we witnessed many civilians caught up in the same plight. OK so let’s lay it out for you. The Soldier Roll was introduced to us by our HR manager at Warhorse who was introduced to it by an ARMY gal that worked at the PAX terminal. The tarmac was about one hundred feet behind the tent with a neat line of four-foot-
tall barriers spaced out on the edge of the tarmac in the rocks. Everyone loved the ankle turning, knee twisting PAX
Terminal rocks. Some were small but as always, the larger softball size rocks would work themselves to the top creating a hazard at night because ninety present of all flights were at night which that exacerbated the situation by not having the ability to use a white light to see the rocks, you could only use a red or blue because we were a black out FOB and snipers loved the beacon of a white light that was like a lighthouse to guide the way. Even driving at night, we could only use our parking lights at night and over time it became natural to us. You learned the

 roads and every potholes, curves and other obstacles on the FOB.
Meanwhile at the flight line the outgoing personal have had their twenty-minute warning to start lining up into two lines per aircraft of up to sixteen plus for a CH-47 Chinook if everyone was disembarking the aircraft or less if this was a milk run which meant the personal on bord were going to other locations in Iraq. Now the smaller UH-60A/L Blackhawk could have as many as twelve passengers not counting the crew of four so it could be very cramped inside and once your buckled in with a four point harness all of the bags are now thrown on top of your legs and if its winter the doors shut, summer they are left open so now you are also task with keeping baggage from falling out of the aircraft and littering the Iraqi country side with your stuff or someone else’s stuff. Can you just imagine sitting there in you Jesus hut, (Iraqi mud hut) when a duffel bag full of khakis and dirty underwear or a samsonite suitcase full of porn and dirty underwear comes crashing through your roof killing your goat. Inshalla indeed. But most times the upper ranks were placed into them and given a little more space.
Now the game is a foot as everyone is lined up carrying bags and luggage, over stuffed backpacks with cute little stuffed creatures attached, full battle rattle (helmet, ballistic vest with attachments like clip holders (real men carried eight hundred rounds), a variety of weapons but usually just M-Fours an M- Sixteen as well as sidearm. As you can guess they are extremely top heavy at this point and for many of them this is there first time being so close to a flightline like this in a combat zone and that inexperience coupled with the wake of rotor wash is well quit a show. Now the plot thickens, just imagine me rubbing my hands together saying boo ha ha in a menacing voice, thank you.
Now here we stand waiting for the first hint of the distinctive sound of the Chinook or Blackhawk aircraft as they make their

 final approach into Warhorse. Everyone is standing in the dark with little flashes of red or blue light as someone here someone there has forgotten their earplugs or securing equipment or that cute little stuffed Camal they got at the Bx attached to their already overstuffed seventy-pound backpack for the flight. Now very faintly you hear the rotors beating the air into submission as they slowly but not too slowly glide in a path to the tarmac, one escorting Blackhawk followed by two Chinooks with a Blackhawk following are silhouetted against the star filled sky, if you look directly at them, they seem to just disappear into the blackness of the night. As they come closer to the tarmac you start seeing a beautiful phenomenon as the dust is kicked up by the rotors and is recirculate back into the rotors causing the tips to start glowing in an eerie neon green light that is in a perfect circle that allows you to track the tillite of the roto blades, it’s just crazy. Now they have finished there decent and now are flying level toward us at maybe ten to twelve foot off the tarmac and the personal to our left waiting to board are transfixed but the almost overwhelming sound, the building wind and heat from the turbine and the smell of burnt fuel exhaust as we all begin to feel the first strong burst of rotor wash that is rappel increasing. It’s at this point the HR guy, while transfixed by the glowing rotors has starts slapping us on the chest shouting watch them, watch them!
It’s at this point the lead Blackhawk and second Chinook have glided by us, and the second Chinook is now landing almost in front of the line to our left. Its rotors are now fully engaged an catching air to force it downward in an ever increasing force outward as the air has no other place to go but lateral away from it and creating a huge surge of rotor wash outward causing a human domino affect with the top heavy soldier in front being hit with a wall of concentrated air are unable to keep their feet and are toppled over into the person behind them, some try to catch the person in front of them as they fall only to be bragged

 downward by the wind and unexpected wight and precarious way there backpacks shift on the person in front as they fall. Some try to turn away only to be off balance themselves and with the help of the larger rocks are pulled to the ground by that nasty bitch called gravity.
Oh, the concoffne of shouts and cursing in more than one language could be heard over the turbines and rotors only a little over seventy or eighty foot away with the back of the turbine on our side glowing a dull red on the exhaust end. With the helicopters now settled into place with its rotors still turning fast but now engaged into a neutral position and now throttle back abruptly stops the assault of air and overwhelming sound on the personal even now trying to gain there feet once again. The back ramp of the Chinook which was retracted half way up during the landing phase is now lowered to revile were the tail gunner sat straddling a M249 SAW belt feed machinegun with his legs hanging over the ramp while in flight only secured with a safety harness to the interior of the craft. He nonchalantly steps out and stretches his back before motioning to the personal seated inside to rise, gather there bags now stacked down the middle of the craft with bench seats on both sides and make their way out of the back of the aircraft being carful of the SAW and the almost two foot stepdown, the personal from the PAX terminal are now approaching to help the new comers toward the PAX for processing into the FOB. As for us the fun and memories of the Soldier Roll is almost over. We see a few facies from the glow of the interior of the craft and bid them a farewell as we recognize Soldiers we have seen around camp for the passed year or in the DFAC at Christmas or Thanks Giving but for myself it was a few that I had worked with over the countless body’s in the Aid Station and seeing the MAN or WOMEN now that was only a young Medic just twelve months ago and incident to war.
As we walk away and as the helicopters throttle up and rise into the blackness and the neon green fades away, we are again in darkness and silence other than the never ending sound or the dozens of diesel generators. Time for Green Beans and maybe a muffin?
Below are just notes and revisions and the last part, my rambling can be cut.
runway from its days as a small private airport ed inside
the flight crew full drops the rear door that up unto now was were the tail gunner was sitting with there M249 SAW now with its belt out and hood open, inert for now.
All around us everyone are struggling to gain there feet as there heavy burden and gravity try’s to pull then back down, words of discus in more than one language. At this point we spring into action to help people back to their feet as the helicopter unload there replacements and cargo. And that’ the Soldier Roll. 
Fin.


But I do remember one thing we would do for entertainment during times when troop movement was heavy out of our PAX Terminal (passenger terminal)

1pkggmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pkggmv/my_23m_gf_22f_witnessed_me_have_an_emotional/,My (23M) GF (22F) Witnessed me have an emotional breakdown and went to her parent's the next day. How do I move forward from here?,"Hello, This is my first time posting on Reddit and I have a lot of context to get through so stick with me. I, Tyler (23M), and my girlfriend, Grace (22F), have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for almost 1 year. (names are changed for privacy) .This will be long so TLDR will be at the end if you want to scroll all the way down. However, This story requires the context so I would encourage you to read through. Some context that will come back up throughout the story is that I work a 3rd shift job that is very mentally taxing due to the workplace and nature of the work. Grace works a 1st shift job that is physically taxing and mentally taxing due to the workplace being toxic.

Last Night me and my girlfriend Grace had one of the biggest and definitely loudest argument that we have ever had that ended with me having an emotional breakdown where I was crying and losing it a little. The main reasons for the argument are doing chores around the apartment and overall stress on the relationship.

To start, when Me and Grace moved in together we agreed on assigned chores for each other and what we expected from each other living together. My assigned chores: Dinner, Dishes, Trash, and overall pickup. Should be noted that as part of Dinner and Dishes I end up doing all of the kitchen area cleanup/pickup as well. Grace's assigned chores: Laundry, Vacuum/Mop Floors and overall pickup. This is imbalanced from the beginning but I volunteered to do the dishes and trash because when Grace lived alone and I would come over; Her dishes stacked up so much mold began to grow on things, and trash sat so long without getting taken out that small gnats/flies were producing and flying around the trash can. I was worried about these habits before moving in together but I figured If I handled these specific tasks it would be ok. I volunteered to handle dinner because I knew she wouldn't want to or be able to cook after getting home from work and I liked and knew how to cook more things than here.

The first month or two went fairly smooth and we were doing what we each agreed to do. Grace wouldn't pick up a thing here or there but I didn't mind because It took 5 seconds to clean or throw away. But as time passed and we lived together longer Grace began to neglect her chores and not picking up after herself became a more frequent occurrence. Again I wouldn't really say anything about not picking up because I still didn't mind and I wasn't perfect about it either even though I did eventually have to pickup after myself because if I didn't do it then it wouldn't happen. I would mention the floors and laundry not being done here and there but never a serious conversation about it because Grace was always tired and stressed from work and a conversation would lead to what she doesn't like that I do and her crying and having a breakdown. However, recently Grace doing her chores has become a bigger issue and that's partially because she really wasn't doing them but also partially because my patience over time has grown thinner.

The reason my patience had grown thinner isn't just time it's because that while Grace had been doing her chores less often. I have been doing more chores and extra things. On top of making or buying dinner almost every night (Grace would cook dinner once or once every other week) I also started making Grace breakfast in the mornings after I would get home from work. I volunteered to do this at the time because Grace was getting breakfast/coffee at McDonald's every morning or really most of the time I was buying it for her or us. I realized how much money that is over an extended period of time so I presented options for Grace to do at home and she wasn't keen on anything that didn't have to be cooked. I volunteered to do this because I felt it was a supportive thing to do, I liked cooking and I was saving her and me money. I also was vacuuming when it got bad and she wasn't doing it and cleaning the toilets when I noticed they were dirty. I realize that a lot of these things I volunteered to do but I was doing it for what I thought were the right reasons. And again I know I should have had more conversations with her but I was worried about her mental health and her feeling like I was micro managing her and constantly nagging.

Now as I said recently Grace's issues with neglecting her chores and not picking up after herself has become a bigger issue and there is a primary reason for that. For the past 4-5 months maybe longer she has been playing Minecraft online on a server against other people but recently she started talking to people while playing through Discord and the Discord for the Minecraft server. This has led to what I see as an unhealthy obsession. Grace comes home and takes a bath/shower and immediately gets on the game, when she lays down to go to bed she stays in the voice call and watches people stream their game on discord. And when she first started talking to people she ruined her sleep schedule by staying up till 5 am gaming which she said was ok because it was the weekend but then on the weekdays she still stayed up till 2-3 am gaming when she needed to wake up at 6-7 am. I recognized that she was having fun and even though we weren't interacting almost at all I understood that it was most likely a temporary obsession. There were some tense moments where she thought I was upset about it but we talked it through and the obsession did resolve over the next week or two she was still playing it and talking to people every day. This new obsession is what I believe made her already bad habits with chores even worse.

The last bit of context I want to add is that a different primary stressor that has been in Grace's and I's relationship even before we moved in together was the Work Shift difference between her and I. When we first started dating and for the first year and a half we were both on first shift. But when I was going to finish my degree I had to find a ""field-study"" (co-op, apprenticeship) In my field as a requirement to graduate. The only job I could find was on 3rd shift so therefore I took it and switched to 3rd shift. This was fine at first but It has caused issues throughout our relationship here and there and Grace has asked me to find a 1st shift job a few times now and I do want to get off of 3rd shift. The problem is that as we all know the job market is currently awful and I've applied to 100+ jobs but haven't even gotten an interview or meaningful reply back. It doesn't help that my field limits my options and I'm only living slightly above paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to not work for even a month. Therefore my only options are to try and get a job that I have personal hang-ups about that would require some lifestyle changes, or stay with my current job and keep applying for jobs.

**So with all of this context we can get into the Fight itself last night and the current situation.** A few days ago I was looking for a shirt and opened the washer/dryer to try and find it. When I opened the washer there were clothes in there that were damp and smelled really bad and I asked Grace how long they had been there. She said something around a couple of day's or something to that effect and I was annoyed but I was getting ready for work and dropped it. 20-30 minutes later I was leaving for work and I grabbed the trash out of the can and went to leave, she was playing Minecraft talking to people and I tried to get her attention multiple times so I could say bye like we usually do, but she was in the middle of a game and didn't notice so I left without saying bye. That night turned out pretty bad for me: late for work, super busy at work, didn't get to say bye, etc. So I texted Grace and told her we needed to have a conversation about chores and doing stuff around the apartment. She doesn't reply and I come home from work to her still gaming at 5 am, it was the weekend but a week or so after we had our conversation about the gaming. On top of this, we had gone grocery shopping that day and I put away the frozen or refrigerated stuff and left the dry stuff on the counter and the trash can had no bag in it because I took it out when I left for work, when I came home the groceries were still on the counter and she couldn't put a bag in the trash can for me either. I go to the spare room and close the door, she goes to the bedroom and sleeps for a few hours. When she wakes up she says ""lets talk"", I do my best to calm down and we have what I feel like is a productive, healthy conversation when she understands where I'm coming from and says she will be better. The day after: leaves a granola bar wrapper and a small piece of it on the coffee table, I throw it away and just snicker to myself. 2nd day after: she leaves her dinner plate with food on it on the coffee table, I throw it away and tell her about the granola wrapper and dinner plate in a half joking away and she understands and laughs about it. 3rd day after: I go to do a small load of my laundry that I need for stuff I wear frequently, I open the washer and their are damp clothes in the washer that smell bad and now I'm pissed. I text her while she's at work that I'm upset and we can talk about it later but that I hope she still has a good day and that I love her. She says I have every right to be upset and apologizes and we leave it there. That day I end up sleeping late and when I wake up she Is gaming and talking to someone. I give it 15-20 min and then ask if she can mute and I try to start the conversation, she mostly blows me off and then goes back to talking to them. I am frustrated/pissed and start half throwing dishes around that were drying and go to the spare room. She comes in and says ""do you hate me"" and from there we get into talking and it starts ok but it escalates when she starts to blame me for things I don't do and it turns into a yelling match. Admittedly, while she yelled first I definitely yelled more and louder. It ends and I go to the spare room and start crying, I never cry, and she comes in and tries to console me which kinda helps but also makes me more upset because she's who I'm upset at but I do love her and just want everything to be ok. I then start half-yelling half-crying and have an emotional breakdown. I then have to go to work and we say bye and that we love each other and I go to work. I come home the next morning, she gets up earlier than usual because she's going to work early and gets herself breakfast. When I wake up I have a text from her that, ""she's not doing ok mentally, she's taking a break and staying at her dads, she's not happy with the conversation or how she was spoken to, and she knows I'm not doing ok mentally but she can't be my support system right now"". Mind you during my breakdown I literally said I feel like I'm everybody's rock mental health wise and nobody is my rock.

Some quick additional context is that Yes, I am dealing with a lot outside of my relationship issues as well. My mom has had a lot of physical health struggles over the past few years that almost cost her life and is now having mental health struggles. My dad has been struggling with mental health for a while but only alludes to it and him and my sister have cut each other off so I am his main support system. There is also a current ordeal with my little half-brother and his mom (different moms) trying to get custody of him after not having custody for 5 years.

My main Issue now is that I feel like I want to be done with this relationship, but I still love her and love the memories we have together. And she does have so many good qualities that are rare and I'm worried I wont find someone with those qualities again. We live together and still have 4 months on the lease. And while this may sound arrogant I know that her being with me has stabilized her financially and mental health wise and I'm worried if I end it she wont recover. And she has helped my mental health in a lot of ways and helped me become a better person in a lot of ways as well. I just don't know how I can be with someone and think about building a future with them when In a time of personal crisis they leave and say, ""they can't be my support system"".

So that's mostly all of it, I know that was a lot, Thank you to anyone who reads this and can offer me advice. I just don't know how I should move forward from here.

**TLDR: Me and my Girlfriend got into a fight about chores after recent issues. She saw me have an emotional breakdown and the next day went to her parent's and said ""she can't be my support system"". How do I move forward.**",6,1765507004.0,relationship_advice,37,0.8,False

If you’ve ever come by our spot near heroes coffee I’d love to know - what can we do better? What’s missing? What would make you want to come back (or in)?

At ayun nga, kahit na i used Chef RV's recipe, hindi ko na-achieve yung wet dough nung nagstart ako sa wet ingredients with the ""cocoa powder"". Doon pa lang naisip ko na hindi na lagyan ng flour at all yung recipe.  So I did, and yet hindi pa rin naging medyo runny ang consistency niya. I added coffee diluted in water pa nga, plus vanilla just to put some moisture pa, and more oil. Pero wala talaga. 

Now, since i started baking, i bought a kilo of this and I still have one pack of 500g. I am not so comfortable to just throw  away lalo't nanghihinayang (worse, actually, nasasaktan talaga) ako at galing din naman yun sa capital ko na pinagipunan ko kasi wala naman akong work lately. Pero kung wala na talagang solusyon para salbahin ang cocoa powder na ito, i guess itatapon ko nalang talaga. Heartbreaking, but I will take it as a lesson learned to ALWAYS check the brand/label (and that i should not to be so emotional about things like this!)

Please, for beginners out there, never settle for the mumurahin. I'd rather go with the one with purple packaging if Dutche din naman. Mas mahal pero i have tested it before with my first brownies and okay naman siya. I just thought nung una, na it was the same, iba lang packaging kaya mas mura that's why i bought it.

TL:DR
I will never recommend Dutche Special Cocoa Powder kahit sa beginners pa yan. Nasayang yung binili oong isang kilo at hindi ko alam ang gagawin sa stock ko. 💔 Meron bang recipe na magandang pag gamitan ko nito? ",3,1765506942.0,BakingPhilippines,5,0.81,False

She really likes the beans at Bourgeois Pig and Headrush. I was thinking adding The Roasterie to the gift bag too, because it seems to be a pretty big KC stable.

Normally she’ll get a medium roast, but she does switch it up to some fun flavor blends if that’s what the shop is known for. 

Does anyone have ideas on brands, roast recommendation, and the best place to purchase?  If I could pick up the majority from a local grocery store, that would be ideal. I don’t think I’ll be driving to Lawrence just to pick up some coffee beans. ",3,1765506704.0,kansascity,11,0.8,False

1pkgbc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1pkgbc7/meat_god_egghead_chapter_iii/,MEAT GOD - EGGHEAD: Chapter III,"According to the file, the deceased was a Hawaiian man in his late forties. The medical record of the Saint John’s Clinic, a health center in Wyoming, said that, apart from being a little overweight and at certain risk of heart arrest, due the high level of cholesterol in his blood system, he was a healthy man. The medical record wasn’t old. The last time the deceased had a periodical check, was just three weeks ago. The professional, named Harriet Ramirez, didn’t found anything unusual in the patient’s condition. It was logical to assume no much can change after only three weeks.

The deceased, or the *body*, as the forensics rather refer to dead people in the morgue, was a far from the term “healthy”, as the dictionary would put it. His skin was terrible pale, even for a cadaver. Even worst, a lot of dark blue veins were noticeable at a glance, some of them were varicose.

The old forensic expert, James “Jim” Chung, was alone in his office of the morgue. It was a rainy night and his two colleagues were out, expending those late hours with their wives and sons, probably in bed right now. Most likely, somebody would take the day off tomorrow. Chung didn’t have a wife, or children awaiting for him at home, just Mr. Morrison, his bombay cat (maybe, hidden under bed because of its fear to both, the water and the thunder). Chung was a loner, and even when he had some romances in the past, he was never much interested on such trivialities. He found talking with the cops pleasant, especially with the investigators, for he liked to talk about crimes and soccer. But he liked much more when he was left alone with the bodies. His two colleagues were great experts, even if they still have a few things to learn about the job, but great experts never the less, and they spoke between them just the minimum in the morning, and almost nothing while doing an examination.

Chung knew very well how his two assistants liked to interact with their coworkers, in the police department. They were more talkative with the cops, and even made dirty jokes about their female coworkers, and sometimes they laughed really loud at the coffee shop. But the worst thing, Chung thought, was that looking as bad as some of the dead bodies they store in the containers, they believe they could attract the young ladies’ attention. Really. Two grown-up forensics, with their boring shirts and their yellow brown teeth due to smoking and coffee consumption (and whisky as well). As for Chung himself, he didn’t care about that. What he really cared about, indeed, was the bodies and the well written forensic reports. The jury deserved the only best.

His little brown eyes were moving left to right, registering the written sentences on the deceased’s file about Ryan Anaka, or the “Crazy Hammer” as newspapers call him. No journalist could put her nasty hands over the suspect’s identity just yet. But the TV news reports said something about him being not only delusional, but also a heavy heroine user, and a known alcoholic, and more likely a homeless, as if being a homeless was something bad *per se*. But Chung, even if he found the lies of the press to be pure horse-crap, he thought it was funnier than reading the factual text on the police file.

After three cigarettes, ten pages of the report and a chocolate, doctor Chung decided it was time to give this maniac killer a look. He put on his white coat, his gloves, no need for a mob-cap for he had almost no hair, and went to the bodies storage room.

Anaka was in the compartment number 14, next to rotten skeletal remains of his mother.

Chung opened the refrigerator compartment, moved the body bag to the stainless steel table, and rolled it toward the autopsy room. Next to him, was a little metal table full with medical instruments and metal plates the shape like kidneys. Chung opened the zipper of the gray body bag, and took a long good look to what was left of Anaka’s face.

The forehead was sunken in the left side. The upper part of the skull exploded. Part of the brain was still hanging from the bloody aperture, an intricate mess of broken bones and soft tissue. There were two little holes, one in the frontal bone, right over the bridge of the nose, and another in the frontal maxilla, near the upper incisors. Of course, the terrible damage of the brain was the cause of death. No need of an expert examination to tell.

The first step was cleaning the body

No far, there was a new cassette camcorder, the same TV news people use, aiming at the examination table. The camera has a big microphone that looked like a hairy ball. He checked the cassette compartment, and then turned the camera on.

“Right”, Chung said, without looking at the lens. “This is doctor James Chung, about to examine the rest of Mr. Ryan Anaka, for the Michigan Police Department. It’s August 16^(th), 1975. Anddddd, let’s go.”

*Funny thing*, Chung thought, *you got a taste of your own medicine, right? At least, according to the news.*

The forensic took a few polariods for the Michigan police’s file, and then he picked the scalpel. He made two large incisions under both clavicles, that joined in the center of the chest, and then another one that went all the way down, circling the navel, ending right before the pelvic area. The skin felt a bit odd to the touch of the blade, almost like a jellyfish capsule, making a liquid sound as the forensic was cutting it. The sound of rotten skin. Underneath, the thick layer of fat was of an intense orange. Carefully, Chung folded the skin aside, and centered his attention to layer of muscle, shinny and so pink, not the normal color of healthy muscle mass.

It was rotten flesh.

*But how could this be?*, doctor Chung asked himself. *This man died yesterday, and he’s already one week rotten.*

Chung took a square chunk of Anaka’s white skin for analysis, and then sliced the abdominal wall in two, and opened it like a window frame. He was no sensitive to bad smell, especially those of rotten cadavers. The red intestines, with paths of blue, were all the evidence he needed to say the obvious: The body was as decayed from inside as from outside.

“Ok, now let’s check the chest.”

The doctor picked the costotome, strong steel pliers, to cut the ribs one by one, enjoying the crunching sound they made, even the cartilage connection to the lower ribs. He ended up with a bizarre square of ribs and tender pinkish flesh, and used the connection between the strong *sternocleido-mastoid* muscles of the neck and the *manubrium* bone as a hinge, to gain view of the internal organs.

“Oh, wow!” Chung whispered in surprise. “Mmmm, this…, hummm. What’s this?”

They were like hundreds of little white translucent fibers, going here and there, around the meat ball of the heart, the shinning thick tubes of the vein and arteries, and the black bags of the lungs.

Chung used the tip of a long forceps to touch the fibers. They shined like marble when the light hit them.

“Well…, mmmm, looks like we have some worms. They have infected the heart and the lungs. It’s like a big colony of…”

Chung used the forceps to move aside one of the infected lungs, and with two fingers of his right hand, he moved the heart to take a deeper look. Almost hidden by the dark blood and rotten fluids, there was something that looks like a big tubular root.

“Oh, Jesus! What happens here?”

Chung looked at the camera and back to the body.

He sliced the principal vessels attached to the heart, the big aorta and pulmonary arteries, the superior and inferior cava veins, and extracted the organ. It was hard to see, especially due the pool of dark blood between the meat bags of the lungs, but scattered on almost every organ, there were some tinny white fibers, almost invisible because they were translucent.

Chung used a vacuum to suck out the blood, and that strange root emerged at the deep bottom of the thoracic cavity, well hidden by the lungs and the brown mass of the liver. Mostly, the alien root was milky white and shinny as marble, but when the light hit it, Chung could see some kind of bluish reflections, like stripes under its liquid skin.

“Curious”, Chung said. “There’s some kind of parasite inside his chest. And lots of little maggots, but not of any kind I saw before. Maybe this man was sick, maybe he had some kind of infection. I never saw this.”

He grabbed a piece of paper and cleaned the thing, and he noticed it looked like a big worm. The little white fibers were connected to it, like hundreds of tinny tentacles, or capillaries of the mother root. The body of the thing was divided into segments, like rings, but the thing was more or less shapeless.

“This is strange” Chung said. “Or not. I’m going to collect it, and send it to CDC for further analysis or to a biologist. Okay.”

Chung tried to grab the big worm with the forceps, but it was too thick, slippery and it was firmly attached inside of the cavity, almost like another organ. He sliced some of its filaments or feelers, and went for the thing itself. But when he touched it with the blade, he heard a high pitched shriek, almost a short whistle.

The forensic took two steps back, crashing his lower back against another examination table.

“The hell was that?!”

Before he had time to digest what was happening, the body sat, the heavy mass of its red intestines fell over its legs and the metal table. Chung gasped, as the swift hands of the cadaver took both of his shoulders (its grip, strong and firm as rock), to bring him forward. Despite of the panic induced shot of adrenaline, the doctor could do little to resist the wild force of the rotten arms, which pushed his face closer, deeper into the dim, dank interior of the heartless chest cavity. In a second, Chung felt the soft and putrid flesh of Anaka’s breathless lungs on his face. The pulsating fibers over the bag of the lungs, vibrated when they reached his nose and lips. The gunk coagulated blood lubricated the hole left by the heart. The tubular tip of the white parasite inside Anaka’s chest, got inside Chung’s mouth, muting his moans, moving through his throat, chocking him.

Chung stepped back, crashing again, this time with a cabinet, and some glass jars got broken on the floor, but he didn’t noticed it. He shivered, felling weak for the lack of oxygen, as the thing occupied the whole space of his throat. He tried to puke out the thing in vain, while noticed the hundred or so jelly like fibers sticking out of his mouth, every time his lips touched each other. They felt like little worms, zigzagging over his tongue. He tried spitting them in vain, for they were the feelers of the thing traveling down his esophagus, with less likely good intentions in hands.

He looked at the attacker. The body, it seemed, was dead again, for the torso was lying motionless over the bulk of rotten intestines. Its skull rested hanging in a weird angle, over the gap between its knees.

Chung knelt on the floor, breathing only through his nose trills, dripping tears and grabbing his blocked throat, gasping for air, asking himself what to do next, what he should do next, and if he was going to die right there, in his own morgue. “How convenient!”, as people on the commercials say. His vision became blurry, and he was sure in that moment, that he was done. D*eath awaits me.*

But no, he didn’t die, no in the way he was accustomed to understand and explain death. He felt angry, right, and hungry and horny. He stood again, breathing heavy, not thinking too much, and look at both his hands, and then around, and roared in anger, blood coming out of his mouth, and roaring felt like a good idea.",1,1765506588.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False
