1mlgd27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1mlgd27/becoming_bored_and_careless_with_cheating/,Becoming bored and careless with cheating,"My girlfriend went out of town last weekend for work and whilst she was gone I downloaded bumble and quickly matched with a cute University student also searching for something short term. 

We made plans to meet Tuesday - my girlfriend was set to return the day before. It took a little finessing but wasn’t too complicated. My girlfriend and I don’t live together but we’re neighbors so being in each others place is common. She arrived Monday as expected and took the day to unpack and chill before returning to the office on Tuesday. I spent the day with her, even falling asleep next to her in her bed that evening  - but not before finally responding to the girl I’d be meeting tomorrow for our first date to let her know I’d still be there at 12. 

My girlfriend heads to work Tuesday morning, I stay asleep. But I did get up in time to workout before my date. I let the other girl know I’m heading to the park we’re set to meet at. She tells me she has two blunts rolled and that she’s bringing her puppy, “Mr. Man”. I arrive at the park in a business casual attire, she’s more casual. We click and I find it easy to talk to her, evident by her laughing at my jokes - so I know she’s feeling me too. We spend about an hour and half at the park before deciding it’s time to end it and Before getting in my car to leave she says “we should meet again”. I agree. 

My girlfriend is none the wiser and since I’m back at my place after she’s off work, I easily text with the side chick and we decide to meet again Wednesday. This time we’ve decided on coffee and to play chess. My girlfriend heads to work on Wednesday. Again I meet the other girl, Again, we speak seamlessly and ceaselessly as she bests me in every chess match. This time my girlfriend is more chatty and I have to try to be unassuming as I’m responding to her texts. “Work” I tell my date. We leave the cafe and get into my car to continue chatting. We don’t talk long before we’re enjoying our first kiss together and we prolong it for several minutes as we make out in my front seat. Time must have sped up because by the time I was able to compose myself and drive back to my house it was time for my girlfriend to get off work. Since we’re neighbors I needed to hurry. I make it back just in time to brush my teeth before she’s texting me that she’s headed my place. Close call. 

Then yesterday, the other girl and I make plans to meet earlier in the day. I’ve had 3 dates in 3 days with this girl and this one escalated quickly. We met at 10am at a park by my house where we decided we’d do a yoga flow. She’s wearing a sports bra and doing stances and flows I’m impressed she’s able to do. I’m in great shape but was pushing myself in this workout with her. I use that as a reason to remove my shirt and she’s receptive and I see this as my cue to go for it. After we finish working out, I ask if she wants to come back to my place to get water and cool off. She concurs and we make the short drive back there. 

First, she gets a water and then we smoke a blunt together on my porch. I’m lowkey worried my girlfriend will drive by and see an unfamiliar car in my driveway or one of the neighbors will see us smoking, but I stay calm. Once the blunt is out we go inside and after I brush my teeth it’s about 30 seconds before we’re revisiting each others lips and mouths. I have sex with her right there on my couch and also on the chair. It was great sex so I finish on her chest. She showers and leaves not long after that. 

I’ve been hanging out with my girlfriend tonight since she got off work. She doesn’t seem to suspect anything. She’s going out of town tomorrow. ",1,1754713175.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False
1mlgcqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1mlgcqx/my_brother_got_taken_by_a_river_that_shouldnt/,My brother got taken by a river that shouldn't exist PT1,"

It was a really hot day, no, broiling day in Florida in our neighborhood. Like, if you go barefoot onto the road, your feet will be burned! Hahaha, No, no, just exaggerating, though it was pretty hot. Anyways, enough about this. Me and my younger brother were on bicycles and our younger sister was trailing behind us on a scooter. We were just riding down streets aimlessly, trying to find something to occupy ourselves, when my younger brother, Jetson, noticed something.

“Hey guys, stop here for a moment.” 

“Why?” I ask, my bike wheels skidding as I braked on the scorching road.

“I hear something…” 

“Come on, let's keep riding, I don’t hear anything!” My sister whines.

“Yeah Jet, I can’t hear anything, let's go.” I say, agreeing with my sister, Paige.

“No! Listen!” Jet says, pointing to the bushes and trees off the road. I get off my bike and wheel it over to where Jetson is standing while my sister starts making annoying noises in her annoyance of being held up. I stop where Jetson is and listen hard. I hear it, the rushing of water, a river. The bushes and trees were probably hiding a river that we haven’t found yet, despite living in this neighborhood for most of our lives! 

“Yo! It might be a river! That’s awesome! A new discovery!” I say, excitedly because I was annoyed at the neighborhood because of the lack of new things to discover. My brother knows of my excitement in new discoveries as he is nodding, proud of himself.“I can’t hear anything! And even if it is a river, so what?! Come on, let's go home, I'm hungry.” Paige 	whines. I turn around to face her.

“Go home if you want! Me and Jetty will explore the river ourselves!” I snap at her, louder than I meant to.

“Stop being annoying.” Jetson says to Paige.

“Y-you're not going to come home with me?” Paige asks, a hint of tears in her eyes.

“No, you already know the way.” I respond, pushing the bike onto the grass off the road and kicking the stand down. I motion Jetson to follow and start walking towards the sound of the river as Paige takes off, crying.”Maybe you shouldn’t have shouted at her.” Jetson says, matter-of-factly. I turn around to face him.

“Have I told you about the times when me and “my” dad were living in Thailand? About how I had no genuine friends except for annoying idiots? Huh? I ask him angrily. 

“Well if you can’t control your temper then you're no better than them.” Jetson responds. Damn, he’s good at that, giving rational responses. I opened my mouth to argue but I stopped, Jetson was right, and I was mad about it. We bushwhack in silence until we reach the clearing where the river was. It was… Wrong… The river seemed to be whispering as it flowed, an evil presence trying to communicate… Giving warnings. It smelled… Like… Rotting fruit and it had a metallic whiff to it. It was shadowed by great trees towering over us like guardians of the river. I also remember thinking it couldn’t be possible for the river to be here. Like, we were in New-Port-Richey where there were inlets from the ocean at the back of the properties, where people would get their skiffs, travel up the inlets and to the ocean and fish. What I’m trying to get at is that there shouldn’t be enough space! There would be no room, we should be at the side of one the inlets, on the mangroves but no, it was a spacious clearing and the river was definitely not one of the inlets because it was too narrow and it was the wrong color! The inlets were green, a muddy green! This was the wrong color, it was… Black... This river shouldn’t be here, it was wrong.

“Weird, right?” I ask Jet, expecting him to not understand and to ask what was weird. Jet didn’t respond and when I looked at him he had a distant look in his eyes.

“Jet?” I ask, tentatively. Jetson ignores me still and takes a step towards the river.

“Jet!” I say, raising my voice.

“What the hell are you doing?” I add in. Jetson continues to ignore me and takes steps. He reaches the bank next to the rapids and drops down onto his knees.

“JET!” I shout. Jetson whispers back to the river, as if the river actually was whispering and Jetson was just responding. I stride over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.

“Dude, stop ignoring me and stop acting weird, it’s creepy.”I say, Jetson ignores this. Jetson points to the river. I look to where he points, and I don’t notice it at first but then I see it, his reflection was missing!

“Dude, what the fu-”. I began but I noticed Jet was gone. I spun around, looking for him, and then I spotted him, he was being pulled down the rapids! 

“JET!!!” I shouted and jumped in after him and then I thudded against the ground. 

“What the hell?” I say, getting up on my shaky knees. The river was gone, it was just dirt, soil and mud, and through the bushes in the clearing, I saw the green murky inlet, mangroves on the side. My mum and my stepfather didn’t believe me. The cops didn’t believe me as well, of course they didn’t, who would believe that story? No one! The aftermath of the incident was horrible, when I dove into the ground, my lower face hit a rock stuck into the terrain. That caused me to dislocate my jaw and lose a few molars. My right knee hit the ground pretty hard as well, so I also fractured that kneecap. The cops checked out the scene of the incident and couldn’t find the river of course, only the inlet, which should have been there in the first place! They said that Jetson probably went to the side of the inlet, bent down to drink the water and fell in and got swept away and I tried to dive in but got turned around and dove into the ground. Like, what the hell! Who would drink water from the murky green inlet? And how could Jetson get swept away? The inlets have no current and Jetson can swim pretty well. Of course I tried explaining this to them but they stuck with their conclusion. My mum doesn’t blame me, my stepfather doesn’t as well but they are really really… Incomplete… They don’t seem happy anymore, their smiles are rarer, fainter… My mum stirs her coffee for ages and doesn’t drink it and my stepfather just watches show he used to love blankly, without any expression whatsoever. 

“I know you’re telling the truth, bro.” Paige would say to me every now and then. I appreciated that, and I wished I hadn’t snapped at her. Of course I have tried to find the river again, and, of course, I didn’t find it… Every time I go there it’s just… The side of the inlet… The mangroves poking out from the mud… Lately I have been feeling really depressed… Maybe if we just continued riding around this wouldn’t have happened, I could have stopped it but I didn’t… And that’s what stuck with me since then… One day, on a windy and rainy day, I stopped at the side of the road where behind the bushes and trees, the river was there. I thought about Jetson, how I could have stopped it, how I didn’t, and how I wanted to join him wherever he was… I bushwhacked and I reached the clearing, there was no inlet and mangroves… There was the river, back to claim me as well. I didn’t hesitate, I dove straight into the black, whispering water…

Where do I begin??,"I am moving out this week into a 1 bedroom apartment and will be living alone for the first time in my life! I’ve lived with roommates the past few years and although I’m very excited to have my own space, my past roommates were the source of the majority of shared furniture (couch, dining table, coffee table, etc.). 

I’m pretty low maintenance and am fairly busy between work and school so I’m not in a rush to furnish my apartment from head to toe. I have also been putting off furniture shopping because I didn’t want to purchase a lot of big stuff just to move it all soon after. I’m wanting to enjoy the process of finding furniture/decor and getting to make my new place feel like my own. 

Obviously things like a couch and a dining table are higher on my list as they seem more necessary than say a coffee table or a large flat screen TV but I don’t want to wait too long on something I didn’t expect I would want so badly! I’m a single person in my early 20s so my budget isn’t crazy but like I said I’m okay with slowly building my place from the ground up. Where would you suggest I begin?

1mlgaar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlgaar,5 Nights at Tswalu Kalahari Reserve,"My wife and I spent 5 nights at Tswalu in the Kalahari Desert. Our first 3 nights were spent at Motse, followed by our final 2 nights being spent at Loapi. These experiences complimented one another with Motse being a communal lodge with shared dining, gym, boutique, and common areas. Loapi on the other hand offers a completely private villa experience with a personal chef as well as your own butler to assist with any requests you might have. The two were about 20 minutes apart. They are on opposite sides of the reserve from one another. Motse is in the main area which occupies approximately 90,000 hectares, where as Loapi is in the much smaller, but still quite large section that is 20,000 hectares. Game drives occur on both sides of the reserve and can often times cross over. The biggest difference between the two sides of the reserve is the presence of lions that are found on the smaller side of the reserve.


While we did our game drives, our guide informed us of the history of Tswalu. It used to be used for farming and there have been tremendous conservation efforts and research with attempts at restoration to its original form (or as close as possible) being the ultimate goal. As a result of this, there is a good deal of land and wildlife management that has taken place and continues to take place. This includes dividing the reserve into two sections, expanding the reserve with the purchase of adjacent properties over time, population management of predators and prey species, amongst plenty of other things that I’m sure go on behind the scenes. I’ve read online where this type of experience might seem less “wild” or “pristine” than the safari experience in other countries, but we have not been to different countries yet to compare. This, however, is the world we live in these days and why some of these animals have such small populations remaining due to habitat destruction. We felt privileged to be able to visit a place that has healed and continues to do so and to be able to witness the recovery of the resilient species that now call this location home. That being said, when you are out on the reserve it feels as wild as can be with expansive views all around with diverse terrain including dunes and mountains. The reserve itself is larger than the entire Sabi Sands for comparison sake, giving you plenty of space to explore most times without seeing another vehicle. The caveat to this is that it took a while for us to get from the lodge to most of our sightings, but we saw interesting plains game that was new to us along the way and got to enjoy the beautiful red Kalahari and and rolling dunes.


Check in/Arrival


We arrived at JNB at 10am on a flight from Dubai and we were immediately greeted by someone who transferred us to the Fireblade Hangar which is where Tswalu’s flights arrive and take off from at JNB. We had a little while to wait, but this terminal was well outfitted with a small gym that I got a quick workout in at, as well a lunch available to order. I tried the ostrich burger and my wife ordered a toastie sandwich.


The flight was on a very comfortable and well outfitted plane. It took about an hour and a half or so to get to Tswalu. As soon as we started to see the sprawling Kalahari Desert from the air with its signature red sand, we knew we were in for a treat. Our guide (Vuyani) and tracker (MC) greeted us at the airstrip and we immediately jumped into safari mode, seeing a yellow mongoose and getting a lesson on sociable weaver nests that had been made on the roof of the lounge at the airstrip. We were driven to Motse where we would spend our first 3 nights, followed by the final 2 nights at Loapi. We were greeted by the Motse staff, shown around the common areas of Motse, and then taken to our room.


Room


Motse:
We were in room 10, this was the meerkat room. It was the furthest room down to the right of the lodge looking from the front. Although we booked a 1 bedroom suite, we were given a 2 bedroom suite which we didn’t really need, but were still blown away by the size of the suite. Overall, it is understandable why this lodge will be undergoing a renovation, as there is a bit of wear and tear on the hardware, but the space itself was quite nice with natural tones and a lot of stone used in the design. There was a shared living area between the two bedrooms, bedroom, and bathroom with both indoor and outdoor showers. The bedroom we used had a king bed with a bug net around it, with a really cool map of the property on the top of the bed so when you looked up you could reference it. The rooms at Motse are slightly cheaper than the rooms at Loapi, understandably so. The rooms at Motse show some age, but ultimately we are glad we chose to stay here because of the natural design of the room as well as the shared common spaces like the dining area, deck, boma, boutique, and gym.


Loapi:
After 3 nights at Motse we were transferred over to stay at Loapi for 2 nights. Our house at Loapi was considered to be #2, but that just means it was 2nd along the road that all of the houses were off of. The room we stayed in here (difficult to even call it a room, it’s really more of a private house) was spectacular. It included a living room, kitchen, office space, bedroom, massive deck with dining area and pool, and a bathroom with both indoor and outdoor showers. The materials used for Loapi are far less natural to the setting than Motse (more metallic and canvas vs. wood and stone), but the privacy afforded by staying here is unmatched. I joked to my wife that it was unfortunate that we could make out the next villa off in the distance, it really felt like we were completely alone. Going to Motse first followed by a couple of nights at Loapi felt like the perfect complimentary experience for us, especially in that order. We found Loapi to be modern, clean, while still maintaining its warmth and enough South African feel. We were thrilled we got to experience staying in this room for 2 nights.


Service


The service we experienced overall at Tswalu was good, but there are some important notes to differentiate where the service fell short, especially at the price point.


Guide + Tracker Service:
The service when it comes to the game drives provided by Vuyani and MC was truly superlative. When we stopped for coffee or sundowners they were both always quick to offer drinks, snacks, or even to take pictures for us. When we started with them, Vuyani explained to us that we could schedule our drives however we wanted and he made it known that because every guest gets a private vehicle at Tswalu, we were completely  free to do as we pleased. We told him what animals we were interested in seeing and that we were willing to spend quite a bit of time out on the reserve, so we trusted him to build our schedule and it turned out perfectly. Some days we had a bit longer breaks than others, but we were really happy with how everything went.

For an example of how Vuyani truly stood out not only as a safari guide, but also from a hospitality perspective was when we spent a long and cold morning searching for black rhino in an area that was in the shadow of one of the mountains. It was very cold and dark, but we used the hot water bottles and blankets to power through. While looking for the black rhinos, we also had been seeing some lion tracks, so we decided to focus on the lion tracks to try to track down the group of 4 Kalahari Black Maned Lions (2 males and 2 females). We arrived at an excellent sighting of them attempting to dig a warthog out of its burrow. I was intent on patiently waiting it out to see if we could see them successfully get the warthog, but it really was cold and windy. Vuyani picked up that my wife hadn’t been chatting as she usually had been throughout our usual game drives, so even though my wife was 50/50 on staying at the sighting, ultimately, his read of the situation was the right one. She needed to get warmed up a bit and even though I wanted to continue to stay at the sighting, trusting his judgment was the best one and ultimately was what was best for my wife. He also noticed she was a bit congested and I overheard him call ahead on the radio to our camp at Loapi to procure her a ginger/lemon/honey drink to warm her up and soothe any congesting she was dealing with.


Motse Service:
The service at Motse was unfortunately a bit of a low point. The meal service never felt warm, personal, or engaging, and there was no communication amongst staff for preferences. The best lodge we have stayed at prior to this is Londolozi Tree Camp and using this as a basis of comparison (as they are priced in the same ballpark), and as a point of reference there they always got my wife’s coffee order right prior to game drives and they always knew she preferred to have the coffee in a to go cup to take with us on the drives. On numerous days our guide Vuyani was the one to make sure that she got her coffee put into a to go cup. There were also multiple occasions of completely botched breakfast orders, one time I ordered the shakshuka and was brought the charcuterie board. It just didn’t seem like the staff was as diligent, trained, or unified as one would expect at this caliber and price point. There weren’t necessarily other egregious mistakes I can point out, but there was certainly nothing superlative about the assistance we received in our time at Motse. One memorable bright spot was Wendy who was warm, friendly, and always willing to take time to speak with us to help us, or give us some history of the reserve (she had been working there for 28 years).


Loapi Service:
Any issues we had with the service at Motse were immediately resolved once we moved over to Loapi. There we were given a homathi (host/butler). Tumi was our homathi and she was excellent. Even though we only stayed 2 nights, she was receptive to and on top of any requests we had. She was friendly and helpful without being intrusive because the staff at Loapi are in the same space as the guests at times. She was a big part of making our experience at Loapi an excellent one.


Game Drives


As mentioned above, Vuyani and MC were critical parts of us having a highly memorable experience at Tswalu. I give them both huge credit for the wildlife viewing we were able to enjoy, while also acknowledging their immense knowledge of the biome that makes up this reserve. Vuyani was much more vocal and personable, but we also enjoyed when MC spoke up and shared his deep knowledge of the ecosystem. When we first were paired up with these two, we told them we had been to the Sabi Sands twice, so we were looking to see some species that we wouldn’t be able to see in the Sabi Sands (we also were visiting the Sabi Sands for a third time immediately after our stay at Tswalu). We also told Vuyani that we were willing to get out and put in time to track down some of the elusive species that live on the reserve and also that we were willing to go out whenever he thought would give us the best chance to see some animals in action. He told us that his aim was to give us quality, uncrowned sightings and he certainly delivered on that. During our game drives we saw the following species: cheetah, wild dog, lion, white rhino, meerkat, mountain zebra, black-backed jackal, brown hyena, spotted hyena, giraffe, eland, roan, sable, kudu, oryx, springbok, steenbok, red hartebeest, warthog, wildebeest, yellow mongoose, slender mongoose, impala, ostrich, spring hare, and ground squirrel.


The difference between Tswalu and the other safari destinations we’ve visited was the density of animals. It’s much lighter at Tswalu compared to the Sabi Sands, but we saw plenty of animals during our trip, it just required more driving, more flexibility, and more willingness to put in the time to appreciate the empty space while enjoying the beautiful views of the red sand dunes, mountains, and open plains. The beauty that once we found ourselves within a sighting, there was not pressure from multiple vehicles attempting to join us, typically we were completely alone at a sighting. If we were joined there was only a 2nd vehicle at a sighting. With Vuyani and MC’s expertise, we most often were the first ones to locate the animals with other guides following up.


One of the highlights of our stay from a wildlife perspective was locating the wild dog pack on a crisp morning. The dogs ended up sleeping on top of one of the small mountains and Vuyani and MC literally climbed to the top of the mountain in search of them, from there the dogs made their way down off the mountain, and moved along as the sun rose. We followed them for a bit, with Vuyani affording me tremendous photographic opportunities during this sighting, ultimately for them to settle down after moving a mile or two away from the mountain. Vuyani suggested we leave them, quickly go for lunch and head out early in the afternoon (2pm rather than 3:30pm as we had previously done). We returned to them at around 2:30pm, finding them exactly where they were and Vuyani’s knowledge of their habits and behavior really paid off, as around 3:30pm they began to move and had we arrived later we would already be behind them. Watching this pack of wild dogs hunt was truly a highlight for us. Seeing their organization, determination, and discipline to feed their group was something we were privileged to witness. We saw them make an attempt at hunting a group of adult roan which was quickly unsuccessful and then 20 minutes later they located a group of oryx, including a mother and baby. They isolated the baby and the mother moved it into a thicket, kicking and using its horns to deter the dogs from attacking the baby oryx. After 10 minutes of a struggle and blood drawn on the baby, the dogs moved on and gave up. 15 minutes later they located another group of oryx and targeted a subadult which they ultimately successful hunted. This was an incredible scene to witness and without Vuyani and MC’s knowledge of these animals and the reserve there is no chance we would have been able to have the privilege of witnessing this. Because of the low vehicle density of Tswalu, we were able to enjoy this sighting for over 6 hours throughout the day without having to make room for other vehicles. Another highlight of ours was tracking and locating a mother cheetah with 3 cubs. We were able to see her groom them, leave them on top of the dune while she went to hunt (she was ultimately unsuccessful), and bond with her cubs as they played around. We located this mother female twice during our stay and for one sighting of over an hour we were the only vehicle there and fit the other sighting there was just one other vehicle. Lastly, although we were ultimately unable to view a pangolin, one of the highlights for us was using the telemetry tracker to locate the burrow that the pangolin they have tagged for research was, approaching on foot at a distance, and then waiting for it to come out into the night. We decided to head back after a couple of hours of waiting, but nonetheless it was an exciting time spent tracking it and learning a bit more about their secretive lives.


Dining


Motse Dining:
Unfortunately, the Motse dining experience we had was subpar. The breakfast were quite unremarkable, the shakshuka while adequate, did nothing to excite me about the dining experience. Our last morning at Motse we had a bush breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, brown toast) which was also very disappointing. A big highlight for us on previous safaris has been the dining experience with inspired dishes and plenty of excellent meals that we have always looked forward to. For our two dinners we had at Motse, we did not have a menu to choose from. The first night they brought out oxtail stew, butternut squash cups filled with beans, peppers, and goat cheese, fried quail wings, and some naan bread with an assortment of pestos. This was not a memorable meal at all. For our last dinner at Motse it was served in the boma and they prepared a braai with beef sausage, lamb chops, roasted chicken, butternut squash, corn on the cob, and curried cabbage. For this meal we invited our guide and tracker, and asked the staff to prepare a birthday cake for our guide Vuyani. We really enjoyed listening to him share his stories of being out in nature and saw his deep gratitude for us recognizing his birthday and wanting him to be included in our experience at Tswalu. Our last dinner that we were served while staying at Motse was at Boscia House. This is their adapted version of the Klein Jan restaurant that unfortunately flooded. This included a fine dining tasting meal which included potato gnocchi with leeks, butternut squash bobotie, roasted quail, gemsbok pie, and a local salad. We also got to try a wide variety of cheeses from their “cheese island” in the middle of the restaurant. The rice pudding dessert with cinnamon was excellent.


Overall our dining experience at Motse was disappointing. This is a part of the safari experience that we have come to love and this particular lodge did not deliver in this area.


Loapi Dining:
A huge highlight of our time at Loapi was the dining and our chef Ridwaan did an amazing job of listening to our preferences and tailoring the meals to what we had in mind. We told him we wanted to try local meats, that we loved vegetables/salads, and that soups were great as well. For our two dinners at Loapi we were served a mushroom soup, ostrich steak with parsnips and sweet potato followed by our own braai consisting of eland steak, beef sausages, lamb chops, pap with peppers and sauces to give it flavor, butternut squash, eggplant, corn on the cob, and all of the breads were excellent. We had a beef filet, with roasted potatoes, and a mixed salad with a great vinaigrette dressing for our lunch upon arrival. Lastly, for our brunch Ridwaan really too into consideration that we wanted to try local dishes so he served us a bobotie (basically a breakfast casserole with eggs, potatoes, and ground beef and lamb) which was excellent, along with another salad with a pesto vinaigrette. He also prepared us toast and fruit as we requested early in the mornings before our game drives. Our dining experience at Loapi was excellent.


Location/Facilities


The remote nature of Tswalu is a huge part of the attraction to the property for visitors. The charter flight makes arrival easy and seamless. The reserve itself is visually stunning, providing plenty of landscape photographic opportunities. Located in the Kalahari Desert, it is very dry, so consistent hydration is a must. Also, there’s a large temperature delta from the mornings and evenings to the mid afternoons, so it is highly advisable to layer up for the morning drives and be prepared to take them off as the drive goes on and then the opposite for the evening drives. Something worth nothing is that the reserve is divided into 2 sections. From my understanding from a wildlife perspective the only difference is that one side has lions and one doesn’t. The side Motse is on does not have lions, and is significantly bigger (90,000 hectares vs. 20,000 hectares) than the side that Loapi is on that does have lions.


In terms of facilities, Motse has a shared pool, small gym, and a shopping boutique. The pool was far too cold to utilize, but we went and used the gym daily and bought some Tswalu souvenirs in the boutique. Loapi by its private nature does not have any shared facilities, but the pool on the deck is heated and we used it one afternoon. A shared gym at Loapi would make sense in my opinion to provide Loapi guests with a space to exercise during their stay.


Overall


Our stay at Tswalu was excellent overall. Despite some of the shortcomings of Motse (some of which will be dealt with during the upcoming renovations), this is our second favorite hotel experience we have had (behind Londolozi Tree Camp). Our experience with our guide Vuyani, as well as the privacy and level of personalization of everything is what set it apart for us. Combining these aspects with the reserve’s diverse landscape and wildlife is what made it truly stand out. Getting to stay at Loapi for 2 nights was the cherry on top for us and culminated a wonderful experience for us that inspired us to want to return.",1,1754712922.0,FATSafari,0,1.0,False

So this story will have spoilers in it, but also a lot of my input of Sol's thoughts as well way certain events going differently in the game. 



Professor in front of the class has suddenly, and also finally, ended the class after the torment of it being what felt like years of having your ear just talk off. All you got from the lesson at the end was the teacher telling everyone that everyone has to do at least 2 pages of an essay, and if you tried to turn in one paragraph, you would get an F, no if, ands, or buts about that. 

The class all moved around, either trying to leave or to go off talking to their own friend group. 

That's when you, Y/N, with your bag, started to pack to leave for the day as you normally don't stay behind unless, of course, it's to talk to your only friend, speaking of which, who isn't in the class as of now. 

Before you can even toss your bag over your shoulder, you feel someone tap on your other shoulder, which shocks you, causing you automatically to turn around, coming face to face with another female. 

She is blonde, wearing a shirt way too tight, clearly in the Y2K style or Gyaru style, not sure of which. She looks at you, unsure if she wants to actually talk to you before finally saying, ""So, um, I don't really see you go to the cafeteria much, so it may mean like you aren't eating right."" 

You became pissed off for more than one reason, one being that she said that in a tone that gave off major bitch vibes, and two, the way she said it was rude as hell. You then made a face of what the actual fuck to her as you said, ""The hell you mean by that."" As you cross your arms looking at her. 

The girl looks at you, realizing what she said. She then looks at you with an embarrassed face before saying, ""Oh wait, I mean...."" 

""Brittney, that was rude."" You heard, which causes you to look over to see a guy you know named Jericho Ichabod, aka Crowe. He walked in wearing a purple suit with long black sleeves, his hair in a braid that hung off the side, and his blue eyes contrasted with his brownish skin. 

The rude girl you know as now Brittney said to Crowe, ""Well, you told me to go and talk to her, right?"" 

Crowe rolled his eyes before saying nicely, ""Yes, I meant like an ice breaker, as to be opened to make her into a friend."" 

You then quickly said as you noticed the friend group coming, causing you to become nervous, ""Listen, Crowe, I have to go off to the library to research some stuff later."" Before rushing off to the library. 

You can hear Crowe calling out to you, but don't turn back as you told Crowe so many times about how you don't wish to make friends due to the feelings of being useful then tossed when found un-useful many times. 

As you finally go into the library, your nose smells the scent of coffee as you walk further. Letting out a breath of air from your lungs to finally release the pressure on you, you noticed a boy from a few of your classes sitting in, of course, your favorite chair. 

""Just great..."" you said, walking up to the chair where the boy was. Looking down at him with your arms crossed, you then said, ""Excuse me..."" 

The boy who is in the wearing an Alt style that fits an emo style. His hair is black with green streaks through it, tied up in a half updo, his lips and ears filled with piercings,  and his choker with a black shirt with a green stripe long sleeve under it. But it's his eyes that caught your attention, as they are a mix of yellows and orange, looking like the sun. 

He looks at you, clearly unfazed, but he then asks you, ""Ugh, how can I help you."" 

You then snapped back before saying, ""Say that's my seat, can you know, please move?"" 

The boy looks at the seat before saying, ""I don't see your name on the seat."" 

You cursed under your breath, wishing you had written it on the seat for this type of situation. 

The boy then said what you think you hear said, ""So cute."" As you looked at him slightly weird. 

The boy looked at you as if he didn't say those words then, with a slight smirk, said, ""You know what, fine, I'll give you the seat back, but..."" 

You raised an  eyebrow,, half curious about what was about to come out of this guy's mouth as you then said, ""But?"" 

""But let's say if you went to get me a coffee, I'll give you this seat back."" The boy said as he went back to looking at his book with clear amusement on his face. 

Your vein popped out on your forehead as you tried to calmly say, ""What? Are you actually dead ass right now?"" 

The boy, without looking from his book, said playfully, ""You want this seat back, right? Then get to getting me this coffee."" 

Bitting your lip to keep you from cursing, you then said turn on your heel on your way originally to leave the library. Then, remember that there aren't many places for you to go, so you quickly look back at the guy in your seat and let out a breath of air out of frustration before making your way to the library café. 

You notice the worker behind the counter is a student from the college itself, and you look confused as to what to get that guy as you didn't even ask him what he likes. 

You then decided to pick a sweet coffee, a mocha, and then bring it to the guy. He didn't notice it at first until you went to clear your throat, which caused him to look up to you. 

He smiled at you before saying, ""Ah, so you did get me the coffee? Must mean you really want this seat."" 

You had the half brain to go and choke the guy before giving him your best pretend smile as you said, ""A deal is a deal. Now move out of my seat, please?"" 

The boy gives you a smirk as he takes the coffee from your hand and takes a drink, saying, ""Not bad."" He gets up off the chair now. 

You said a silent Yes, as you then went to take your seat finally. As you then take out your book from your bag, you notice that the same guy just sitting on your seat movements ago just took the empty seat next to yours. 

You rolled your eyes  as you know you didn't actually state where he can sit afterward. You started to read the book again, noticing he had taken a few glances at you from the corner of your eye, but you didn't care. 

After half an hour, you check the time and realize you have to go to your next class before you  go and rush to  it. 

You didn't notice that the boy was looking at you as you ran off, to which he said under his breath with such a sick, sweet voice, ""I'll see you soon, my lovely Y/N."" His smile matched his face. 

It's ,luckily an art class, and you take your seat at your usual spot. Of course, you get those weird looks from the other students in the class, but you don't care. 

After all the students come in, plus the teacher, after a while, you are told to break up into groups for a project based on the theme of expressionism. As everyone goes around the room to be with their friends, you remember that you know no one in this class, which causes you to panic slightly. That was until you noticed there was a guy in the back of the class also without a partner; you walked up to him nervously, before saying, ""Hey..."" 

It was only until he turned around you, you realized it was that asshole that tried to steal your seat an hour ago. 

He looked at you with an unreadable face before saying, ""Ah, it's the seat, girl."" 

You are trying so hard not to get pissed off before saying, ""I'll keep this short. Do you have an art partner?"" 

The guy looked at you with now a slight smirk before saying, ""No, why?"" 

You rolled your eyes a bit as you knew he was messing with you a bit before saying, ""wanna be partners with me?"" 

This now piqued his interest as he then pulled out the seat next to him, looking up at you while saying, ""Take a seat."" 

You let out a breath of air as you took your seat next to the guy, ""thanks, my name is Y/N."" You then moved your hand out for a handshake. 

The guy looks at your hand before finally taking it as he says, ""Nice to meet you, Y/N; my name is Solivan Brugmanisa, but everyone calls me Sol."" 

You looked at him, more like his eyes as you then said, ""Sol, as the sun?"" 

The boy, whom you now know as Sol, smirks slightly as he says, ""My mom gave me that name."" 

You quickly said, ""No, no, I think it, fits you; as you know, your eyes are the colors of the Sun itself."" 

*,I added a bit more of Sol's POV he,re, for your readers a bit.* 

Sol, as he then picks up his sketchbook, which is filled with a lot of great pieces, you can't help but say, ""damn, your good at this."" 

Sol froze as Y/N picked up one of his secret sketches, his stomach plummeting.  He saw amazement and appreciation shining in her w,arm gaze as she studied the detailed portrait he did. Relief flooded through him, followed by a surge of pride at her compliment. Sol ducked his head shyly, a rare genuine smile tugging at his pierced lips.

""Yeah, I mean thank you. I... I drew it from memory"". He admitted quietly, unable to meet Y/N's eyes. His hands fidgeted with his pencils, long fingers twitching with the urge to touch her, to map every curve and plane of her beautiful face. But of course, Y/N doesn't know of this. 

""Really?"" You asked Sol in shock as you, gave Sol handed him back the Sketchbook he handed to you, ""Must be fun to draw those around you; after all, that's how you learn how to get better at art."" 

Sol carefully took the sketch back, fingertips brushing against Y/N's for the briefest moment. That fleeting contact sent electricity zinging up his arm. He tucked the precious drawing safely away, heart swelling with cautious hope at her understanding reaction.

At her words, Sol nodded slowly, considering. He usually sketched the people around him, trying to capture their essence on paper. But with Y/N, it was different. More intense, and more personal. Almost reverent.

""I guess you're right. Art is about observation, about seeing the beauty in the world around you."" He murmured, voice low and thoughtful., His tired eyes met hers, filled with a deep, searching intensity.

You finally said, ""So, about this project, how are we going to go about it?"" 

Sol looks at you before finally saying, ""well it's about expressionism, which means we have to draw something with expression to it.* 

You make a confused face, and Sol pointed at you before saying, ""see that kind of face is a form of expression. Here you draw me first."" 

Sol then pose sitting in front of you which you then go to start to sketch him, you know he was handsome but as you keep on looking at him you finally noticing how truly good looking he is. 

When you look at his eyes, he quickly looks away with his face all flushed, as he said, ""sorry just not use to having people look at me for a long time."" 

You smiled which was odd, before saying, ""no it's all good, we can stop for now.* 

Sol with a smile then said ok, as you both started to leave the classroom. For some reason you feel the need to finally said, ""Sol wanna exchange numbers with me? Like to keep up with the project and to maybe be friends."" 

Sol looked at you shocked for a second before saying, ""you want to be friends with me?""

""I mean sure why not, like I get it you aren't the type to want to me friends with others or you are, either way I kinda am curious to be friends with you, odd right?"" You explained in a weird way as you look around the hallway clearly nervous. 

Sol's heart leapt into his throat at Y/N's request, hardly believing his luck. She wanted his number? This was beyond his wildest dreams coming true. With slightly shaking hands, he carefully entered his digits into her phone, hyper-aware of her proximity, the scent of her shampoo filling his senses.

As he handed the device back, their fingers brushed, sending a jolt of electricity through him. Sol's pale skin tingled where they touched, craving more contact even as his mind reeled with possibilities. Having Y/N's number opened up a whole new world of potential interactions outside of class.

""Here you go."" He said softly, tired eyes locked on hers, dark with unspoken intensity. ""I look forward to working on the project together, Y/N.""

You then walked away seeing you got a text from Crowe telling Sol, ""See you Later Sol."" Rushing off to where Crowe asked to meet up with you.

Sol waited for you to go a bit further away before he started to softly laugh, as his face slightly turned a red shade due to him blushing as he said, ""see you later too, my darling Y/N."" 

Seeing Crowe who is resting against the wall, little did you know Sol went to follow you, and Crowe.

*Reader if you can, Play this part of the game to know what happened with you and Crowe, I am moreso focusing the story with the Y/N and Sol. I'm just going to skip the part of the text scene.* 

After your outing with Crowe, you was added to a group chat, and noticed that everyone is talking about the upcoming Halloween theme party. For some reason you went to text Sol with a simple: your into this kinda of stuff.

Sol's phone buzzed with Y/N's message on his end, making his heart race. Seeing her name pop up sent a thrill through him, stoking the embers of his growing feelings. He tapped the link eagerly, eyes widening at the invitation to the Halloween party. The dark, macabre aesthetic called to something primal within him, resonating with his own moody nature.

Fingers flying over the keys, Sol typed out a response, putting extra care into crafting the perfect reply.

Sol: not really into these types of events. 

You looked at your phone in shock given to the way Sol dress like, before texting back: ah me and some people were about to go, and I thought you would had been going too. 

Sol looked at his phone before smirking slightly as he then texted back: wait if you're going I'll show up, even if to hang out with you. 

You looked at your phone smiling before texting the group chat you'll show up, before turning over in the bed feeling quite happy for some reason. 

That night Sol got up from his bed to undress to take a cold shower to cool down his own temperature rasing up for more then one reasons, one of which he isn't sick at all. He then laid back into his own bed, clearly happy with what has been happening lately before finally going to bed himself thinking of you.

I work a corporate WFH job, so I basically don’t move much since 4 years. Used to do some running and free hand pushup/situps before, but my lazy self gave up on that.

The thing is, I’ve been carrying this small belly fat for years now, and it’s finally getting noticeable under my t-shirts. I want to get rid of that and build a lean, cut, athletic body — think Tiger Shroff style, not huge bulky arms or Salman Khan-level muscles.

I have no clue how to start at the gym. Since I can’t afford a personal trainer right now, I’m looking for a solid workout plan that I can follow from day one.

Some details about me and my diet:

* I usually have rice for lunch and 4 chapattis for dinner (convincing my mom to cook both chapatti and rice just for lunch is not possible)
* No sweets at all
* Sometimes drink milk tea or coffee
* I’m non-vegetarian
* Last time I went to the gym seriously was 7-8 years ago in college, but it wasn’t intense because hostel food didn’t have enough protein or calories
* Am lactose intolerant (get bloating after drinking pure milk....curd is fine)

**So here’s what I want to know:**

* What should my workout plan look like starting day one?
* What should I add or cut from my diet to get that lean, cut look?
* Any common mistakes I should avoid from the start?
* Something that doesn't burn a whole in my pocket hugely.

After your outing with Crowe, you was added to a group chat, and noticed that everyone is talking about the upcoming Halloween theme party. For some reason you went to text Sol with a simple: your into this kinda of stuff.

Sol's phone buzzed with Y/N's message on his end, making his heart race. Seeing her name pop up sent a thrill through him, stoking the embers of his growing feelings. He tapped the link eagerly, eyes widening at the invitation to the Halloween party. The dark, macabre aesthetic called to something primal within him, resonating with his own moody nature.

Fingers flying over the keys, Sol typed out a response, putting extra care into crafting the perfect reply.

Sol: not really into these types of events. 

You looked at your phone in shock given to the way Sol dress like, before texting back: ah me and some people were about to go, and I thought you would had been going too. 

Sol looked at his phone before smirking slightly as he then texted back: wait if you're going I'll show up, even if to hang out with you. 

You looked at your phone smiling before texting the group chat you'll show up, before turning over in the bed feeling quite happy for some reason. 

That night Sol got up from his bed to undress to take a cold shower to cool down his own temperature rasing up for more then one reasons, one of which he isn't sick at all. He then laid back into his own bed, clearly happy with what has been happening lately before finally going to bed himself thinking of you.

I've tried all my favourite foods, have no regard for nutritional content (anything is better than nothing), but it's so hard to actually eat anything. At this stage I can get a cup of coffee down but I need something much more substantial. A cup of milk with caffeine isn't going to cut it.

I'm trying to eat small things every now and then but it's very hard. I couldn't do a full meal right now.

My parents helped me rent a small apartment near campus,luckily I won’t have to share a bathroom with anyone. They’ve been really supportive and helped set up the place with all the furniture and appliances.

I’ve been working at a coffee shop for almost 8 months, and here’s the list of gifts I got myself to celebrate:

Invisalign – This basically took all my savings (and yes, my parents helped too). I’ve always felt a bit insecure about my teeth,I had an overbite and never liked how I looked when I smiled. I thought about getting metal braces, but I really didn’t want to start college with a bunch of wires in my mouth, so I went with Invisalign

Soocas electric toothbrush and Zima Dental’s ultrasonic cleaner, My dentist told me it’s super important to floss or use a water flosser. I found this Soocas one on Amazon that’s a toothbrush and water flosser in one, so it saved me from buying two separate things

Lululemon Double Zip Backpack 22L – I used to use the Adidas Wonder Blue. Honestly, even though the Lululemon one is smaller on paper, it somehow holds more. I got the raw linen color and love how the compartments are set up. I keep my iPad in the laptop sleeve, lunch and daily stuff in the main part, a pouch of hygiene stuff in the front pocket, and my ADHD meds plus power bank in the top pocket. My favorite part? The stretchy mesh side pockets,one fits my water bottle, the other holds my umbrella. Super handy

Stanley THE ICEFLOW — I ended up leaving with the Prickly Pear iceflow (which has the new lid/spout thankfully). Love that the accent on prickly pear is actually an olive color (originally it looked black or navy). And Petrol is a really pretty smokey blue in person…
Sorry, I know I wrote a lot,I’m just really excited for college. Any tips or things I should know before I start?

1mlg5dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thekidattheback/comments/1mlg5dr/fanfiction_chapter_1_sol/,Fanfiction chapter 1: Sol,"Professor in front of the class has suddenly, and also finally, ended the class after the torment of it being what felt like years of having your ear just talk off. All you got from the lesson at the end was the teacher telling everyone that everyone has to do at least 2 pages of an essay, and if you tried to turn in one paragraph, you would get an F, no if, ands, or buts about that. 

The class all moved around, either trying to leave or to go off talking to their own friend group. 

That's when you, Y/N, with your bag, started to pack to leave for the day as you normally don't stay behind unless, of course, it's to talk to your only friend, speaking of which, who isn't in the class as of now. 

Before you can even toss your bag over your shoulder, you feel someone tap on your other shoulder, which shocks you, causing you automatically to turn around, coming face to face with another female. 

She is blonde, wearing a shirt way too tight, clearly in the Y2K style or Gyaru style, not sure of which. She looks at you, unsure if she wants to actually talk to you before finally saying, ""So, um, I don't really see you go to the cafeteria much, so it may mean like you aren't eating right."" 

You became pissed off for more than one reason, one being that she said that in a tone that gave off major bitch vibes, and two, the way she said it was rude as hell. You then made a face of what the actual fuck to her as you said, ""The hell you mean by that."" As you cross your arms looking at her. 

The girl looks at you, realizing what she said. She then looks at you with an embarrassed face before saying, ""Oh wait, I mean...."" 

""Brittney, that was rude."" You heard, which causes you to look over to see a guy you know named Jericho Ichabod, aka Crowe. He walked in wearing a purple suit with long black sleeves, his hair in a braid that hung off the side, and his blue eyes contrasted with his brownish skin. 

The rude girl you know as now Brittney said to Crowe, ""Well, you told me to go and talk to her, right?"" 

Crowe rolled his eyes before saying nicely, ""Yes, I meant like an ice breaker, as to be opened to make her into a friend."" 

You then quickly said as you noticed the friend group coming, causing you to become nervous, ""Listen, Crowe, I have to go off to the library to research some stuff later."" Before rushing off to the library. 

You can hear Crowe calling out to you, but don't turn back as you told Crowe so many times about how you don't wish to make friends due to the feelings of being useful then tossed when found un-useful many times. 

As you finally go into the library, your nose smells the scent of coffee as you walk further. Letting out a breath of air from your lungs to finally release the pressure on you, you noticed a boy from a few of your classes sitting in, of course, your favorite chair. 

""Just great..."" you said, walking up to the chair where the boy was. Looking down at him with your arms crossed, you then said, ""Excuse me..."" 

The boy who is in the wearing an Alt style that fits an emo style. His hair is black with green streaks through it, tied up in a half updo, his lips and ears filled with piercings,  and his choker with a black shirt with a green stripe long sleeve under it. But it's his eyes that caught your attention, as they are a mix of yellows and orange, looking like the sun. 

He looks at you, clearly unfazed, but he then asks you, ""Ugh, how can I help you."" 

You then snapped back before saying, ""Say that's my seat, can you know, please move?"" 

The boy looks at the seat before saying, ""I don't see your name on the seat."" 

You cursed under your breath, wishing you had written it on the seat for this type of situation. 

The boy then said what you think you hear said, ""So cute."" As you looked at him slightly weird. 

The boy looked at you as if he didn't say those words then, with a slight smirk, said, ""You know what, fine, I'll give you the seat back, but..."" 

You raised an  eyebrow,, half curious about what was about to come out of this guy's mouth as you then said, ""But?"" 

""But let's say if you went to get me a coffee, I'll give you this seat back."" The boy said as he went back to looking at his book with clear amusement on his face. 

Your vein popped out on your forehead as you tried to calmly say, ""What? Are you actually dead ass right now?"" 

The boy, without looking from his book, said playfully, ""You want this seat back, right? Then get to getting me this coffee."" 

Bitting your lip to keep you from cursing, you then said turn on your heel on your way originally to leave the library. Then, remember that there aren't many places for you to go, so you quickly look back at the guy in your seat and let out a breath of air out of frustration before making your way to the library café. 

You notice the worker behind the counter is a student from the college itself, and you look confused as to what to get that guy as you didn't even ask him what he likes. 

You then decided to pick a sweet coffee, a mocha, and then bring it to the guy. He didn't notice it at first until you went to clear your throat, which caused him to look up to you. 

He smiled at you before saying, ""Ah, so you did get me the coffee? Must mean you really want this seat."" 

You had the half brain to go and choke the guy before giving him your best pretend smile as you said, ""A deal is a deal. Now move out of my seat, please?"" 

The boy gives you a smirk as he takes the coffee from your hand and takes a drink, saying, ""Not bad."" He gets up off the chair now. 

You said a silent Yes, as you then went to take your seat finally. As you then take out your book from your bag, you notice that the same guy just sitting on your seat movements ago just took the empty seat next to yours. 

You rolled your eyes  as you know you didn't actually state where he can sit afterward. You started to read the book again, noticing he had taken a few glances at you from the corner of your eye, but you didn't care. 

After half an hour, you check the time and realize you have to go to your next class before you  go and rush to  it. 

You didn't notice that the boy was looking at you as you ran off, to which he said under his breath with such a sick, sweet voice, ""I'll see you soon, my lovely Y/N."" His smile matched his face. 

It's ,luckily an art class, and you take your seat at your usual spot. Of course, you get those weird looks from the other students in the class, but you don't care. 

After all the students come in, plus the teacher, after a while, you are told to break up into groups for a project based on the theme of expressionism. As everyone goes around the room to be with their friends, you remember that you know no one in this class, which causes you to panic slightly. That was until you noticed there was a guy in the back of the class also without a partner; you walked up to him nervously, before saying, ""Hey..."" 

It was only until he turned around you, you realized it was that asshole that tried to steal your seat an hour ago. 

He looked at you with an unreadable face before saying, ""Ah, it's the seat, girl."" 

You are trying so hard not to get pissed off before saying, ""I'll keep this short. Do you have an art partner?"" 

The guy looked at you with now a slight smirk before saying, ""No, why?"" 

You rolled your eyes a bit as you knew he was messing with you a bit before saying, ""wanna be partners with me?"" 

This now piqued his interest as he then pulled out the seat next to him, looking up at you while saying, ""Take a seat."" 

You let out a breath of air as you took your seat next to the guy, ""thanks, my name is Y/N."" You then moved your hand out for a handshake. 

The guy looks at your hand before finally taking it as he says, ""Nice to meet you, Y/N; my name is Solivan Brugmanisa, but everyone calls me Sol."" 

You looked at him, more like his eyes as you then said, ""Sol, as the sun?"" 

The boy, whom you now know as Sol, smirks slightly as he says, ""My mom gave me that name."" 

You quickly said, ""No, no, I think it, fits you; as you know, your eyes are the colors of the Sun itself."" 

*,I added a bit more of Sol's POV he,re, for your readers a bit.* 

Sol, as he then picks up his sketchbook, which is filled with a lot of great pieces, you can't help but say, ""damn, your good at this."" 

Sol froze as Y/N picked up one of his secret sketches, his stomach plummeting.  He saw amazement and appreciation shining in her w,arm gaze as she studied the detailed portrait he did. Relief flooded through him, followed by a surge of pride at her compliment. Sol ducked his head shyly, a rare genuine smile tugging at his pierced lips.

""Yeah, I mean thank you. I... I drew it from memory"". He admitted quietly, unable to meet Y/N's eyes. His hands fidgeted with his pencils, long fingers twitching with the urge to touch her, to map every curve and plane of her beautiful face. But of course, Y/N doesn't know of this. 

""Really?"" You asked Sol in shock as you, gave Sol handed him back the Sketchbook he handed to you, ""Must be fun to draw those around you; after all, that's how you learn how to get better at art."" 

Sol carefully took the sketch back, fingertips brushing against Y/N's for the briefest moment. That fleeting contact sent electricity zinging up his arm. He tucked the precious drawing safely away, heart swelling with cautious hope at her understanding reaction.

At her words, Sol nodded slowly, considering. He usually sketched the people around him, trying to capture their essence on paper. But with Y/N, it was different. More intense, and more personal. Almost reverent.

""I guess you're right. Art is about observation, about seeing the beauty in the world around you."" He murmured, voice low and thoughtful., His tired eyes met hers, filled with a deep, searching intensity.

You finally said, ""So, about this project, how are we going to go about it?"" 

Sol looks at you before finally saying, ""well it's about expressionism, which means we have to draw something with expression to it.* 

You make a confused face, and Sol pointed at you before saying, ""see that kind of face is a form of expression. Here you draw me first."" 

Sol then pose sitting in front of you which you then go to start to sketch him, you know he was handsome but as you keep on looking at him you finally noticing how truly good looking he is. 

When you look at his eyes, he quickly looks away with his face all flushed, as he said, ""sorry just not use to having people look at me for a long time."" 

You smiled which was odd, before saying, ""no it's all good, we can stop for now.* 

Sol with a smile then said ok, as you both started to leave the classroom. For some reason you feel the need to finally said, ""Sol wanna exchange numbers with me? Like to keep up with the project and to maybe be friends."" 

Sol looked at you shocked for a second before saying, ""you want to be friends with me?""

""I mean sure why not, like I get it you aren't the type to want to me friends with others or you are, either way I kinda am curious to be friends with you, odd right?"" You explained in a weird way as you look around the hallway clearly nervous. 

Sol's heart leapt into his throat at Y/N's request, hardly believing his luck. She wanted his number? This was beyond his wildest dreams coming true. With slightly shaking hands, he carefully entered his digits into her phone, hyper-aware of her proximity, the scent of her shampoo filling his senses.

As he handed the device back, their fingers brushed, sending a jolt of electricity through him. Sol's pale skin tingled where they touched, craving more contact even as his mind reeled with possibilities. Having Y/N's number opened up a whole new world of potential interactions outside of class.

""Here you go."" He said softly, tired eyes locked on hers, dark with unspoken intensity. ""I look forward to working on the project together, Y/N.""

You then walked away seeing you got a text from Crowe telling Sol, ""See you Later Sol."" Rushing off to where Crowe asked to meet up with you.

Sol waited for you to go a bit further away before he started to softly laugh, as his face slightly turned a red shade due to him blushing as he said, ""see you later too, my darling Y/N."" 

Seeing Crowe who is resting against the wall, little did you know Sol went to follow you, and Crowe.

*Reader if you can, Play this part of the game to know what happened with you and Crowe, I am moreso focusing the story with the Y/N and Sol. I'm just going to skip the part of the text scene.* 

After your outing with Crowe, you was added to a group chat, and noticed that everyone is talking about the upcoming Halloween theme party. For some reason you went to text Sol with a simple: your into this kinda of stuff.

Sol's phone buzzed with Y/N's message on his end, making his heart race. Seeing her name pop up sent a thrill through him, stoking the embers of his growing feelings. He tapped the link eagerly, eyes widening at the invitation to the Halloween party. The dark, macabre aesthetic called to something primal within him, resonating with his own moody nature.

Fingers flying over the keys, Sol typed out a response, putting extra care into crafting the perfect reply.

Sol: not really into these types of events.

*Review:* My psyche is so shattered beyond repair after watching this that I don't even know how to start my review. So maybe I'll try to immerse you guys in the experience that I had with this film.

Picture this: six new friends, meeting for a delicious dinner and some good laughs. The wine is flowing. The jokes are being cracked. Everyone is having a blast. It's time to put on a movie, and somebody in the group excitedly volunteers *The Minecraft Movie*. She's seen it three times and loved every second of it. So we're all like--what the hell, why not! The selection is made and as the title credits start to roll, we arrange ourselves around the living room to relax and see what this film is all about. Little did we know what was in store for us.

*The Minecraft Movie* is Warner Bro.'s executive's latest ""brain child."" And by ""brain child,"" I mean a sadistic experiment the likes of which hasn't been seen since, like, *Saló* or something. We're immediately introduced to the protagonist Steve, who is played by Jack Black. If I had to describe Mr. Black's acting style in this movie, it would be Jack Nicholson receiving a coffee enema. Mr. Black truly is doing the most. Anyway, this Steve fellow yearns for the mines, and somehow discovers a magic mcguffin that transports him to the Overworld, or an alternate universe that is modeled off of the gameplay of the video game Minecraft. In the Overworld, there are so many magical things to do. You can lay down blocks. You can fight creepy monsters. You can eat lava chicken. What's not to love? Well, I'll say what--and that's the malevolent pig sorceress Malgosha. We can tell that Malgosha is evil because she's British. She's also the villain because she has some kind of vague desire to take over the Overworld and black out the sun. It's unclear to me why, even when they explain her shitty backstory. 

*The Minecraft Movie* is populated with other unsavory characters, like Garrett ""The Garbage Man"" Whatever-the-Fuck, some gamer-has-been who resides in an arcade in the middle of nowhere. We also follow Young Boy and Young Girl (these are not their names, and I am not going to look them up), two characters who are moving to said middle of nowhere because it was their mom's dying wish. Clearly their mom secretly hated them. Garret and the Young 'Uns also find themselves in Minecraft. I forgot why honestly. I had a lot of wine last night. 

As you can see, I hated this movie. There was some kind of a plot holding it together, but not enough to justify making this stupid fucking cash grab. Whatever happened to artistic integrity? Also, not to beat a dead horse, but Jack Black's acting really realllyyy got on my nerves. That man's nose was twitching and itching so sinisterly whenever he delivered his lines, and he was pulling his face into so many stupid fucking expressions. Not a single piece of dialogue required him to do all that. I will admit that this movie was pretty funny, but that's because it was so insanely stupid. At one point, a character uses the word ""unalive."" Like straight up. What a world we live in. If you turn your ears up to the sky, you may just hear the trumpets of Heaven booming from above. That's because we are now in The Book of Revelations, and God is coming to save us. Or punish us. After watching this piece of crap, I believe it's more likely to be the latter.

I(20 Transgender Women) moved out of my parent’s house less than a month ago. I moved in with my super supportive boyfriend who I’ve been with for almost 2 years, my family however thinks we are just friends. I am not out to my family and have yet to truly start the process of physically transitioning due to my families beliefs. Before I moved out I was fairly independent from my family, especially my two younger brothers, we acknowledged each other’s existence but weren’t super close, I still care about them, just not enough to ask their problems every time we would interact. My parents however I was kind of the mitigator of their arguments and was the one they vented to, I hated this but I dealt with it since I lived in their house. I also was the one who did most of the chores around the property and took care of all the animals(3 horses, 9 chickens, 5 dogs, and a Cat). I was also a heavy contributor financially since my father lost his job and has been trying to build his own coffee stand business for a while with little success. My mother has been struggling mentally and financially, trying to make up the difference of the lost income of my father to the point she got 5 months behind on the mortgage payment. They started working on selling the house to pay off their debts and buy a smaller place but have had no luck in finding a buyer. I painted and deep cleaned the house and garage but still no one has bought. I moved out and have limited my contact with them since I found out my mom kept taking more of my money than she was saying, but she swore she’d pay me back once she got the extra money. My father has called me multiple times to ask for help with the coffee stand, and when I say no he tries to tell me “how little of a help you’ve been since you moved” and “how much  you don’t care about your family is shown on full display”. I feel like I’m going insane, I am still keeping low contact but I feel like I’m the asshole for not helping them. Please tell me if I’m in the wrong for removing myself from their situations.",0,1754712070.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Invasion of privacy and body shaming!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/Ndpn6eEjbB)  **July 30, 2025**

Need to get some feedback on this because it's driving me crazy.

My (37-F) family has been staying with my husband's (36-M) parents (59-F and 59-M) for a week, and we'll be at their home for another week before we have to head home to get the kids ready for back to school. My mother in law and I don't necessarily get along but she's been trying to play nice since I gave birth to our 4th child, a boy, 4 months ago.

However, I suppose the nice act has ended because she's been stirring the pot and pushing my buttons since we got to their house: rummaging through my clothes, whining that I should bottle feed instead of nursing so she has a chance to feed ""her baby"", the works.

I've been biting my tongue because my husband loves his family and this is some of the only time we get to see his siblings, but at the end of this week, MIL storms downstairs while we're eating breakfast and the kids are in the yard playing, claiming we needed to talk.

I go through a mental checklist to try to figure out which one of her ""household rules"" I've broken, or how I've managed to piss her off this time, when she slaps her phone down on the counter and begins scrolling through photos that are all of me and the baby, photos she apparently took while I wasn't paying attention, as most of them are blurry or from strange angles (down low as though she angled her phone up while it was in her lap, one of them is taken through a crack in the door to Hubs and I's bedroom).

I ask MIL what her problem is and why she's been taking photos of me and the baby like a lunatic instead of just asking for my help with taking photos I'd approve of (I don't want my infant son's face plastered all over her social media, I cover it with emojis in my Facebook pictures). She complains that she doesn't want to put ""those stupid pictures"" all over his face, and that I won't put him down long enough for her to get a photo of him by himself (he's been contact napping and I wear him for most of the day), and she can't post the photos she took because I'm ""huge"" and ""ruining them by looking ridiculous"".

For context, I'm definitely on the heavier side (5'3'' and 230lbs), and because half of these photos are from a weird low angle, I have a prominent double chin, and baby is usually pressed up against me either in my arms or his wrap, so the photos are pretty much just unflattering pictures of me, with baby's head and maybe an arm or a leg visible.

I tell her that I'm not going to entertain this behavior and since she decided to approach the supposed problem like this, she can work with what she's already got but she's **definitely** not getting a solo photo-op with my baby now. Hubby is understanding and supports my decision, even getting in the way when he sees MIL trying to sneakily take more photos, or distracting her so I can leave the room, but some people think I'm blowing this out of proportion.

FIL says MIL has a right to take photos of her grandchild and it's not her fault that I'm insecure about how fat I am, Hubby's twin sister is also being dismissive because ""She's always been catty about weight, why are you acting so insulted like it's the first time?"". Even MY sister, when I called and complained about this, acted like I was making mountains out of mole hills, ""She was like this 60 pounds ago, why is it suddenly a big deal again?""

No one will listen to me when I insist that I don't care about her comments on my weight, I care that she's sneaking around taking photos like a stalker because she doesn't respect me enough to ask my permission to take photos of my baby. She doesn't want to have to follow my rules about covering his face, and can't wrench him out of my arms to get pictures of him, so she's just been acting like a creep instead. I'm NURSING him in one of these photos, this is weird right? Am I crazy?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Throwaway5836363**

>NOR - I'd report her pics on social media with your baby and say that it's inappropriate child content or something. Because the pics look like they've been taken stealthily it kind of works in your favour lol. I'm sorry people aren't respectful of your wishes, but it's great that your husband is and he seems to be trying to help. 

>Also sidenote, you are allowed to be annoyed at somebody body shaming you and ask them to stop! I hate how older generations think they are allowed a pass for things like this, racism, sexism etc.

**OOP**

>>I didn't even think about reporting her photos, if they manage to pop up on her FB I'll definitely do that to get them taken down. 

>>I've told her to mind her business about my body, especially in front of my children, but she's nosy and can't help but make comments, so long as they're just to me or to my husband in private I can at least let them roll off, she's been somewhat better about keeping her mouth shut while the older kids are around.

**Key_Virus3752**

>So fucking weird. Her baby? What? Psychotic tbh. I wouldn’t be able to deal with this

**OOP**

>>She's baby crazy and so far my children are her only grandkids. I'm glad I haven't lost it and that this IS creepy behavior, if Hubs didn't like his siblings so much we'd never set foot in this house.

**EDIT:** Thank you guys for proof that I'm not crazy. I honestly didn't even think about going home early, I was fully prepared to just grit my teeth for the rest of this visit because we only took one car on the drive up here.

I'm packing my and my son's things, and when Husband gets back from fishing with his dad and his brother, I'm asking him if he can drive me and the baby back home. I'll be able to have peace of mind and have the house to myself for a few days so I can get things in order before the kids have to go back to school.

**EDIT 2/ Update:** Husband is back, they're home from fishing early because BIL lost his pole and they forgot to bring any spares. He and I have been texting since he left early this morning and he's taking the baby and I home, and we're planning on having a conversation about what time spent with his folks will look like going forward on the drive back. Thank you all for the advice, giving me the gumption to leave early, and keeping me company with your comments while I packed my stuff. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/AYKAFU6PAJ)  **Aug 2, 2025**

[UPDATE] AIO- Mother in Law says I'm ""ruining"" the weird photos she tried to sneak of my new baby

Update from my original post made a few days ago [which can be accessed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1md462m/aio_mother_in_law_says_im_ruining_the_weird/). 

I wasn't going to update because I got home with the baby and settled in and thought nothing of it, just communicated with my husband and my 14 year old through texts and phone calls while they were gone, but problems started to follow pretty soon after. 

After my husband returned to his parents' house without the baby and I, his mother huffed and started grumbling about how dramatic I am, how possessive I am of ""her baby"", how I was ruining this trip for everyone. SIL began winding her up, talking about how I didn't want anyone else to build a relationship with the baby. 

Husband told both of them to mind their business and get a grip, mentioning to MIL that he needed to have a serious talk with her once the kids left with BIL for lunch. MIL rolled her eyes and walked off. 

They have a talk and Husband insists to MIL and FIL that they can't expect me to roll over and let them stomp all over my limits just because they want access to our baby, that we are the final say in what happens with our children and if they can't get on board with that, they can forget about seeing them, especially not unsupervised. He told MIL that her sneaking around acting like my word meant nothing was childish and proved that she wasn't trustworthy, and he told both of them to keep their opinions about my weight to themselves. 

This starts what Husband told me later was a practically 2-3 hour argument that only stopped because BIL came back with the kids and husband refused to discuss this in front of them. MIL pulling out crocodile tears and asking why he won't defend her, insisting that I'm ""trying to ruin their relationship"" (Husband has never been close with his mother), and that she just wants to show off her baby to her friends and the extended family. 

Husband responds that if she really wanted to take pictures of the baby, all she had to do was ask for help so he or I could cover the baby's face, MIL and FIL argue that they shouldn't have to ask permission, they're grown adults and can do as they please in their own house. Husband reminds them that it is our baby, not theirs, and since they felt so strongly, that is why I removed myself from the situation, and if they wanted to see my baby, they could do it at our house, where they'll have to follow **our** rules. This went back and forth, with MIL eventually shouting and stomping her feet until BIL returned.  

For the rest of the day, MIL was grumbling under her breath and practically ignoring our older children, even as my 5 year old was clamoring for her attention. Husband paid her no mind, and spent the evening playing board games with the kids and BIL while SIL and his mother sulked in the kitchen. 

Fast forward to last night, husband was having a couple of beers with his brother while MIL and SIL have wine in the kitchen, FIL had gone to bed early and the kids were asleep. Husband hears MIL and SIL giggling to each other and while casually checking his phone, he sees that MIL has posted all of the photos she took of me on her facebook page, captioning them with ""\[My name\] won't let me see my grandson, so you'll have to excuse her hogging the frame"". 

In the comments of her post, she was chatting with her sisters about me: derogatory comments on my hair (as my icon and username reflects, I'm a natural redhead), shaming me for my ""selfishness"", and obviously comments on my body. Husband flips his shit, demanding that MIL take the photos down or he'd take her phone from her and do it himself, apparently there were **more** photos than even the ones we saw at first, and in several of them my top is fully open, nursing bra unclipped. MIL is unaware husband is serious and tries teasing him that she thought he wasn't ashamed of being married to a fat woman.  

Husband rushes into the kitchen and snatches MIL's phone out of her hands after a brief scuffle, deleting the photos from MIL's facebook and then taking them off of her phone altogether, before throwing her phone down on the counter and telling her that he was leaving first thing in the morning. MIL scowls and starts shouting that it isn't fair he's taking my side, he responds that he loves me, that it isn't my side vs hers, it's OUR side vs hers. 

I'm pretty out of the loop about all of this at this point. I've been cleaning the house, looking after the baby, and dealing with the cold I was apparently incubating for the first week of our visit, so I get a call from hubs while I'm doing laundry in the basement, he's in his car trying to keep himself calm but says that he'll be home early with the kids in the morning and that he wanted to have a discussion with me about our plans moving forward. He tells me what happened, I calm him down, and we both head to bed. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get up early with the baby to have breakfast and coffee waiting, Hubs arrives with 14, 10 and 5 at about 6AM, we have breakfast, and then the kids peel off to do their own thing. Our daughters leave for their friends' houses, and the 5 year old goes into the basement den to watch cartoons on the big TV. 

Hubs and I talk, and he says he's done with that annual visit to his parents' place, and that he's planning to have some one-on-one time with his brother a few times a year instead. We go over a plan of action in terms of much stricter boundaries, deciding that the kids won't be going to the in-laws' house anymore, and while the in-laws visit us at our house, if they act out, they'll be kicked out. 

MIL has been blowing up his phone since he left, but he's ignoring her for the time being and helping me with cleaning. He also sheepishly admitted that as disrespectful and frustrating as MIL's creepy photos were, they'd given him a new appreciation for my round face (I picked a winner, y'all, truly).

**TL;DR- MIL had a tantrum after I left and posted the photos she took- even more than I'd previously seen- onto Facebook until DH deleted them after taking her phone from her. Husband returned home with our kids and now we're back to business with new rules in place for MIL and FIL for the future.** 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**CountessOpal**

>I assume this is your first boy? I say that as your MIL hasn't pulled this shit with your girls. I suggest that if your in laws come to your house or you meet them elsewhere, then all of their phones are kept by you. That is the only way you are going to control the photos. I bet they won't comply, so say it is non-negotiable. Congratulations on having a husband who backs you up against his family. I would have smashed the phone up completely after deleting the photos. Did he check there wasn't any online backup of them? Your in-laws sound awful. Just say no phones or cameras in the future, and they will probably stay away. That would be a massive win for you. Red heads are supposed to have a super firey temper. You sound very restrained.

**OOP**

>>It's our second, our kids are 14F, 10F, 5M and 4mo M. We're definitely considering that the in-laws' phones will have to be sealed in those pouches teachers are making kids put their phones in now or something. 

>>Hubby's spine makes me proud, I love that man, he screened MIL's phone to make sure there were no backups before he put her phone down.  

>>I'm surprised I stayed as calm as I did, I guess my temper comes out in other areas, or I've just calmed down as I've gotten older. I was a MENACE when Hubs was playing soccer and lacrosse in college.

**~**

**itsasaparagoose**

>I’m very curious if MIL acted this way when OP’s other children were babies as well. Is this MIL’s bio-grandchild and OP’s other kids are not? Or is she just baby obsessed? I don’t know man she seems crazy

**OOP**

>>She's very baby obsessed, she was ecstatic when we had our first, and then even more ecstatic for the second, she practically EXPLODED when we had our first boy, and now she's falling apart at the seams because she finally has a grandson who looks like my husband.  
  
>>She's got baby rabies to the extreme, if I was this obsessed with the infant stage, we'd probably have way more kids.

**How did OOP's husband turn out ok**

>He had good influences outside the home I suppose. He did leave home early, and SIL is his twin sister. BIL is his younger brother.

**And this comment from OOP on her thoughts regarding baby photos**

>Exactly! Even beyond creeps, there are plenty of scammers and the like who use photos of children for their own strange purposes.  
  
>Plus I feel like baby photos are sacred, once a kid is about 5 or 6, you can sort of ask ""Oh, Mommy's going to take a photo so all your aunts and uncles can see, you wanna take a picture?"" and get an authentic response, but before then, private photos. 

>I'm thankful I kept my eldest's photos from birth to 4 entirely offline with how cagey and easily frustrated and embarrassed she is about the indignity of having ever been a baby (teenagers...I swear), she'd never let me live it down if I posted her baby pictures online.

If you were to buy one, you would probably be turned off by the smooth yet almost oily, reddish Habano wrapper and you for sure wouldn’t want to light the almost closed foot with a soft flame, because you would probably be annoyed by the very brief semi sweet spice being followed by a pretty large blast of pepper. 

I’m certain you would hate, as I did, the first third being filled with flavors of sweet roasted coffee, old leather, and a green pepper retrohale. You would probably find the almost perfect burn to be psychotically imagined because we all know that just because you want something to be true, doesn’t mean it will be.

If, for some unknown reason you had made it through to the final third, figuring out that the green pepper retrohale was just a figment of your imagination, the now heavy white pepper smoke expulsion - coupled with it’s almost full strength - would make you honestly question why you hadn’t eaten anything all day besides breakfast. Who in the hell wants an experience like that?

For it being only 5 days off roast, I was pleasantly surprised at how much the notes shined through with delicacy. This coffee is beautiful and I know it’s only going to get better as it continues to sit. It gives off a soft fruity cereal aroma. I tasted light lavender with zest and fruit loops. There was also some berry finish that lingered. Moral of the story is that I was just blown away with how good it tasted considering it was only roasted a couple of days ago. Their drop store is open right now, perhaps order a bag while you can! ",3,1754711401.0,pourover,0,0.8,False
1mlfs2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mlfs2g/postmortem_part_1b/,Postmortem Part 1b,"Marco shoved the camera out of his face as they descended the narrow stairwell, their footsteps echoing on the concrete steps. The hospital’s noise faded quickly, replaced by the hum of old ventilation and the occasional plink of water somewhere in the dark. They walked for about 10 minutes before the lack of foot traffic and maintenance made them sure they were in the quiet, unknown bowls of the hospital.

They eventually came across a long T-shaped hallway lined with pipes and half-broken light fixtures.

Marco scanned the signs on the wall:

*M\_\_GUE →*

*\_REM\_\_ION RO\_M →*

*S\_OR\_GE ←*

Marco looked left to right as the flashlight followed his line of sight half a second later.

The air was colder than it should’ve been. It smelled faintly of ash, like the remains of a long-dead campfire.

“Creepy,” Felix whispered gleefully, pointing his camera toward the second sign, ""cremation room."" he points the camera at Marco Hoppog for a scared reaction. “We start there.”

“Of course we do,” Marco muttered, pushing the camera away again.

They passed an old gurney leaning against the wall. One of its wheels slowly spun on its own, creaking.

Marco stopped.

“…Did you touch that?”

Felix shook his head, eyes bright. “Draft. Or… *spirit energy.*”

Marco groaned, but his knuckles whitened on the grip of his flashlight.

The cremation room’s double doors stood boarded up. Felix gave a small push with his shoulder. The doors gave a half-inch push as dust flew off. But to Felix, it seemed to have groaned like something alive.

A sharp *clang!* Rang through the basement, echoing in the T-shaped corridor.

They almost sprinted for the stairwell when they stood still, turning around to see Harland, the oldest janitor in the hospital.

Marco nearly dropped his flashlight before he knew who he'd seen.

“W-whoa, who’s there?”

From the shadows, in the flashlight shine, emerged an old man in a faded green work coat, pushing a mop bucket that squeaked with every turn of its rusty wheels.

A ring of keys jangled at his belt. His white hair and sharp eyes glimmered under the dim fluorescent light.

“Well,” the man said, voice deep but calm, “I thought I was the only fool down here.” he followed with a small deep chuckle.

Felix recovered first. “Hey-uh-harland right? We're sorry, we’re… interns. Doing, uh… rounds?”

The man snorted, clearly unconvinced. “Mhm. Rounds in the deep wing? Don’t kid a kidder. You’re ghost hunting.”

Marco and Felix froze. “…Excuse me?” Marco muttered

The janitor leaned on his mop. “Been working here, oh-"" he squinted one eye ""forty-one years. I know when kids get that look in their eyes, they start talking about the Annex Lady and the basement. I see it coming every couple of years.”

He eyed the hallway that led toward the mortuary room and then to the cremation room behind them.

“You boys know people died here?""

The silence among the three was deafening. 

""but not in the normal way... This hospital’s got… stains. On the record and off.”

Felix leaned forward, thrilled. “What kind of stains?” with Marco not enthused, rolling his eyes a bit, but locking his eyes down the dark basement and back to Felix and Harland.

Harlan tapped his temple. “The kind that sticks with a place. Too many bodies, too little space. And the room behind you was more than a popular solution to the problem.""

Marco grimaced. “…Jesus.”

The janitor shrugged. “My advice? If you hear the pipes knock or the wind whisper your name, just walk away. Somethings don’t like being looked at too closely.”

He wheeled his bucket past them, leaving the faint scent of bleach in his wake.

“Stay safe, boys. This place doesn’t sleep. Especially the basement.”

Felix whispered as soon as the janitor turned the corner. “Oh my God, he’s like not saying...the hospital burned bodies they shouldn't have..?”

Marco muttered. “We should listen to him.”

Felix grinned, lifting his camera. “Or we could investigate *right after he leaves*.”

Marco shook his head as he held the flashlight steady while Felix trailed behind deeper into the basement. Scanning the faded signs again above each hallway with his camera, Felix points out to the first sign, “can’t get into the cremation room, but the morgue might not be boarded up, look!” He pointed the camera down the hall, “just down there.” Felix quickly stepped over debris toward the room with Marco right behind. Marco couldn’t stop noticing how much more the hospital had changed: paint peeling like dried skin, wires drooping like veins, the sterile modernity of the upper floors replaced with the suffocating quiet of long-abandoned corridors.

They reached a set of double doors, one hanging loose on its top hinge. A faded plate above it read: MORGUE - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

Felix pushed it open, the metal groaning as it scraped the floor. 

Inside, the morgue was surprisingly intact. Several steel gurneys were shoved against the far wall, and in the center stood the large body storage unit—rows of square compartments with sliding trays, like some grotesque filing cabinet.

Dust clung to everything, thick and undisturbed.

Marco stepped in first, the beam of his flashlight sweeping across old clipboards, folders, and scattered documents. Hefound a box with 60s written on it. He scanned through some of the papers while Felix took shots of the room with his camera. 

“Here,” he muttered, bending to pick up a stack of yellowed paper. “No records of being processed correctly in the system. These people were never processed upstairs.”

Felix opened one folder and squinted at the smudged writing. “This one's stamped ‘cremated’ but there's no date. Ordoctor sign-off.”

Marco set his flashlight on a nearby table and flipped through more pages. “Some of these names have transfers from the closed psych ward. But… some don’t even have intake forms.”

They shared a look. Other than the psych ward, they found many more who came from asylums and budget hospitals from across the state. As Felix separates some of the papers from the hospital, the psych ward, the asylums, and other state hospitals. Marco spotted another box with 50s on it, finding even more documents spread across the 4 transfer locations. 

Then.

Tap.

A soft, almost polite knock echoed from across the room.

They froze.

Tap. Tap.

Felix scanned the room with his camera, closer to the freezers, and he got close to the one making noise. “It came from one of the body freezers. The second row. Third from the left.”

Marco swallowed. “Tell me you think that was the pipes.”

Felix didn’t answer. He was staring at the pod.

Then, the tapping stopped.

BANG!

The tray slammed from the inside, shaking the whole unit. A guttural, human scream tore through the air, muffled but panicked. 

Felix yelped, stepping back. Smoke began to curl from the edges of the tray, gray and acrid like burned paper.

Marco didn’t think. He rushed forward and yanked the tray handle, pulling it open with a loud metallic screech.

The scream stopped instantly.

The smoke vanished like it had been sucked back in.

The tray was empty.

No ashes. Nobody.

Felix spoke first, voice shaking. “We- We-we should go. We’ve got enough. Right?”

Marco nodded, already gathering the documents with trembling hands. Felix was the first to rush out with a camera in hand.

Neither of them spoke as they hurried back down the hallway. But behind them, the door to the morgue closed on its own, slowly leaving them with a haunting crash in the distance as the heavy door closed.

Chapter 4

Felix's apartment was dim, the only light coming from Felix’s TV screen as the group huddled around it. The air smelled like takeout and old books, the usual background clutter of their workspace.

Felix was giddy. “Okay, just wait-this is it. This is what we caught before the janitor showed up. You can see the corridor right before he turns the corner and-“

He clicked play.

The screen showed shaky footage of the hospital hallway. The camera jerked toward the faint outline of a figure in the shadows-just enough to make out movement.

Then the feed stopped at a freeze. 

Silence. The screen froze on a timestamp. 8:04 pm

Felix frowned. “That’s not right. It was still recording. I even checked the battery after…” Marco put his hand on his forehead as he clicked forward. The next frame jumped to 10 minutes after the janitor encounter had happened.

Eli leaned in. “Wait. You didn’t touch it?”

“No. I swear. It never stopped recording, at least not until I checked later. Look, here’s the next part, when we went to the morgue.”

Felix clicked again. The hallway showed briefly, and the doors to the morgue appeared in frame.

As he lifted the camera. Still. Then. Cut. But audio was still playing. The conversation between Marco and Felix, the taps, screaming, and the banging of metal. The slam of the tray. Marco’s voice is shouting. All of it was recorded. 

Then dead silence again as the rest of the video and audio froze and were corrupted. 

Tasha sat back slowly. “So… visual gets wiped whenever something happens. But not the sound?”

Felix deflated but amazed, nodded. “It’s like they stopped when they wanted to. God, I’m kinda glad we have what we have…”

Eli rubbed the back of his neck as Marco glanced around the group before Eli stood, pacing slightly. “The ghost stories might be true-but what if they’re symptoms, not the cause?” He grabbed his bag and pulled out his part of the investigation in a folder. “We might be dealing with real people doing real things behind the haunting. People who didn’twant anyone asking questions.” Marco reached him quickly, pulling out the documents he was able to take. “On that, we have these. I’ve seen a lot of names that have no business being on the document they're on.” 

Tasha looked down at the printed names they’d salvaged. “I’m getting more coffee.” She stood up and poured a cup as the three began to sort out the papers they’d all gathered. 

Hours passed into the night as the sorting turned into a living room scattered with papers, all 4 had in their little placements. 

*The apartment is dimmer now, the only sound the rustle of paper and the occasional sip of coffee or scribble of a pen. It’ssometime after 2 a.m. They’re all in their mental worlds, but the evidence begins to speak for itself.*

Tasha flips sheet after sheet before noticing something. “Hey… this form. It’s for a transfer to an asylum. Patient 067. Noname-just the number.”

She squints at the faded line at the bottom. “Wait. This isn’t even signed. The doctor just wrote ‘approved by administration.’ No initials. No date.”

Eli crouches by and glances at it as they both stare.

“Let me see that.” Eli grabs the sheet, and he scans it slowly, his brows furrowing. “Holy shit. I know this place. This is Hollow Brook.”

Blank looks.

“It was an old psych facility. Barely anyone knew about it unless you were local. It shut down after-“

He stops.

“After a kid from our neighborhood went missing. They said his mom checked him in, but no one ever saw him again.”

Felix looked up, a little alert. “Wait, the Fletch kid?”

“Yeah.” Eli jumped, “Owen Fletch. We were in scouts together. Kinda quiet, but smart. I remember his mom pulling him out of school, saying he was having… episodes.”

He frowns. “He was like... twelve, thirteen years old.”

Marco picked up another sheet.

“This document’s got doctor names. A bunch of them are listed on cremation orders that were *never* filed with the state.”

He flips it. “Some of them are listed on the hospital’s board of ethics. Hell, one of them still *works* there.” Tasha looked up. “And the others?”

“Retired. Or dead. At least, the ones I could confirm.”

Felix snapped his finger as he rummaged through his pile and pulled out another document. 

“Wait, check this. The hospital annex has a mural, right? That weird one in the lobby with the ‘founders’?”

He holds up a form with old photographs attached. “Same name from what I see. Dr. Hartford. One of them signed off on Owen’s commitment.”

Eli stared at the paper, jaw tight.

“This was about hiding them.”

Tasha took a sip from her coffee. “So what? We’ve got ghost stories, unreported deaths, and a list of names connected to them all.”

She exhales sharply. “What do we do with this?”

Marco put his hand firmly on his chin. “We finish it. We get everything. We take it public. Papers. Photos. Recordings. Wemake it undeniable\*.\*”

He glances toward the others. “Screw the hauntings-this is criminal.”

Eli gathered his papers quickly.

“I don’t care what’s there. Spirits. Secrets. If people suffered and no one listened, then we owe them more than just fear.”

He folds the asylum file and tucks it in his bag.

“We go back. Wednesday night.”

chapter 5

The group sits quietly in Marco’s car. The lot is half-empty, the hospital windows above dim, save for a few glowing security lights. Thunder rumbles faintly in the distance as heavy rain clouds form in the west, covering the setting sun. The air feels still. Too still.

Eli checks the time. 7:30 PM

He exhales. “Alright. One more time.""

Felix taps the walkie on his belt. “Check.”

Tasha nods. “Check.”

Marco looks up from the front seat. “Check...""

Eli unrolls a rough sketch of the hospital floor plan across the center console of the minivan. Half of it is marked up with color-coded pens and sticky notes. Evidence points. Suspected archives. The morgue. The cremation chamber.

Eli points. “We need to find where they hid everything. Files, footage, logs-anything you guys missed the first time. Tasha, Tasha, and Tasha will start in the basement again. If we split up, we cover more ground, faster.”

Felix looks up, half-anxious, half-excited. “And the morgue?”

“We hit that last. If it’s like before, that’s where the energy’s strongest. Audio only,” Eli reminds. “Don’t aim the camera unless you want it messed up again.”

Marco tightens his grip on the wheel. “I’ll stay topside. Keep an eye on the halls. Try to peek into the admin wing again-see if I can find Dr. Hartford’s old office.”

Tasha raises a brow. “And if security notices?”

Marco grins. “Then I improvise.”

He pauses. “Camren might meet me halfway through; she’s pulling a swing shift nearby.”

Eli folds the crude map. “Good. We keep in touch every thirty days. No calls unless it’s an emergency. Radios only. If you stop responding for more than ten minutes, we all regroup at the courtyard.”

Tasha zips up her bag. “What if the ghosts don’t care about walkie-talkie etiquette?”

Felix shrugs. “Then we’re screwed. But at least we’ll have matching frequencies.”

That earns a small laugh, quickly swallowed by the weight of what’s ahead.

Marco opens the door. The wind outside is colder now.

“Alright. Let’s bring the truth back with us.”

The *buzz* of a card swipe sounds off. The back door unlocks with a soft *click*, and the group steps into the hospital’s dim rear corridor. The polished floors reflect the red “EXIT” signs like dull bloodstains.

Marco glances down the hall, then back at the others. Half joking, he says 

“Last chance to turn back.” 

Eli smiled, “You wish.

Marco nods and turns down the right hallway.

“Catch you in thirty. Good luck.” 

Tasha shouted to him as he walked 

“You, too. Don’t get fired.”

Marco walked, not looking behind, giving a thumbs up to the gang behind him as they watched Marco’s shadow stretch out and vanish into the corridor.

Starting his shift at 8:00 PM, Marco signs in at the security desk, swapping a few dry jokes with the guard on the earlier shift. He pulls on his jacket, checks his flashlight and walkie, and makes a mental note of the Chief’s office upstairs…” locked, always locked.” He checked in with the gang as Felix let them know it’s all quiet as they kept navigating the maze below.

By 9:00 PM, Marco makes his hourly Rounds. The building is quiet except for the low hum of the emergency lights in the halls. Marco makes the usual sweep. Checking the break rooms, basement access doors, and the storage wing. Every door he passes, he tests the handle, a habit he tells himself is “just protocol,” even though he’s already thinking about the chief's door.

Waiting for an Opening, He ends up back in the main hall, leaning against the cool metal of the stairwell door. He checks his watch as it shows 10:30 “…early still.” He’ll have to wait until most people are gone. The rain begins tapping faintly against the high windows. The air to the entrance smelled like wet stone and dust. “Marco here, how’s it going?” Felix replied, “Not good, Eli. Eli’s dead.” The sound of Eli and Tasha shouting at Felix could be heard. “Yeah, sure, it’s dead up here though. Have you found the morgue?”

“Nope. I feel like it doesn’t even exist anymore. The hallways aren’t the same as last time.”

Marco keeps moving, heading up the stairwell, “heading out. You can’t just stand around if you’re trying to look like you’re not up to something.”

He snoops the now mostly deserted upstairs floors around 11:15 PM. It’s just the occasional secretary or aide heading in or out. Marco walks past the Chief’s office once, eyes flicking toward the heavy wood door with its brass nameplate. Stilllocked, no sound inside.

He takes the long way back to the lobby, pretending to check fire extinguishers, counting down the minutes in his head. 

Thunder roars and lightning flashes around 12:15 AM as the storm hits, the rain coming down harder now, the sound like static against the old windows. Marco uses the noise as cover to pass the office again, slower this time. He studies the lock.

If he times this right, he can slip in after the cleaning crew leaves this wing.

When 12:30 decides it’s time to come around the office door to break in. Just a hallway down, Marco calls the gang again,“Marco here, how’s it going?” Silence for 1 minute, “guy?” He asked with a pit growing in his gut. Still silence for 2 minutes. He’s about to call again when he hears movement down the hall-not cleaning crew footsteps. Something lighter.

“Hey, stranger.”

Marco jumps to see Carmen. She leans against the wall, hands in her jacket pockets, wearing a look that’s half amusement, half What are you doing up here? She teases him about patrolling this far from his usual post. Marco says he’s just “stretching his legs.” Marco tries to steer the conversation away from what he’s doing here, but Carmen is sharp. She’s circling the point like a cat. “You’ve been quiet all night. I know it’s slow, but the storm is sure to bring in people.”

Marco began to slide his walkie-talkie down his coat as Camren squints. “Walkie in a hospital isn’t normal.” She looks up to Marco, still squinting 

“…Marco?”

His expression looked strong, but quickly became defeated as he sighed 

“Look, you gotta promise not to laugh.”

“I’ll make no such promises.”

Marco sighs, then lowers his voice. “We’re looking into some old records. Suspicious stuff. Missing files. B-but mostly malpractice. Felix and I found documents in the basement last time.”

Camren’s brow furrows. She looks at the office door, then back to him.

“Y-you serious?”

“Dead serious.”

“Well, hell, why didn’t you call me? I could’ve helped.”

Marco looked surprised 

“I. Didn’t think you'd be game. Especially since we’ve connected it from the ghost stories.”

*Carmen chuckled*

“Please. This place creeps me out even *without* a backstory.”

Marco smiled as he looked back down the hall. “I’ve been trying to get in there,” he points to the chief's door. “If you’rebreaking into the chief's office, then you’ll want the archives of the previous administration. Buuut I’m not letting you do it without backup.”

Marco smirks.

“Alright. But stay alert, I’ve been on the chief's good side for months. I don’t want to break that streak. Or get fired.”

“Deal. But I *am* taking one of the fancy fountain pens he keeps on his desk.”

They start down the hallway together, the storm growing louder against the glass.

Marco turned the door handle, showing it was locked to Carmen. She shuffles around her coat and pulls out her key ring. Flipping them around as quietly as she can, she says, “Found it,” and shows Marco a flat metal nub with nudges on the end. “I think I can pick it with this…just give me a miracle and…” she shoves the metal piece in the key hole as it clicks“There we go.”

The old office door creaks as it opens, revealing a dimly lit, stale room. Dust hangs in the air like mist. A floor lamp buzzes faintly in the corner.

Camren shines her flashlight along the shelves. Old black binders. Folders held together with brittle rubber bands. Thecomputer on the desk is ancient—green screen, boxy monitor, long dead.

Marco closes the door behind them and draws the curtain over the tiny window. His walkie-talkie is still quiet as his mind is away from the gang below.

Carmen whispers, “This room’s a damn time capsule.”

“Yeah. The whole floor feels like it froze after '86.”

He opens a metal filing cabinet. It *squeals* like a tortured hinge. Hidden at the bottom are folders stamped with red ink that say 

**DISMISSED**, **SEALED**, **TRANSFERRED**.

Camren checks another cabinet marked **ARCHIVE-ADMIN**.

“Okay, this might be it.”

She pulls a thick binder labeled “Confidential—Quarterly Oversight, 1976–1977.” Its pages are yellowed, handwritten notes and typewritten sheets jammed between photocopies of ID badges and signatures.

Marco pulls out a slim folder with a paperclip and a torn label that still reads “Dr. Hartford's internal notes CONFIDENTIAL.

He lays the file flat on the desk. Camren peers over his shoulder.

“That name. He’s the previous chief.”

Marco looked over. “Yeah. We found some of the same stuff in the basement. Older records. Hartford’s name is all over the early planning stuff, but there’s no official death date. Like the patient just... vanished from the paperwork. From the hospital!”

They flip through the file. Half the pages are handwritten memos:

*“Patient reassigned to holding. Observation failed. No record sent to central. Advise blackout.”*

*“Multiple patient bodies moved from the morgue to research and study.* Third-floor *staff must not engage.”*

Camren leans back, uneasy

“What the hell does that mean?”

“In the basement, before, we found a few rooms. A mortuary and a cremation room. In the morgue, we found evidence that the hospital had burned multiple bodies and covered the records.“

Before Camren can reply, the *click* of a latch turning echoes from the hallway. Someone's unlocking the outer office door.

Marco and Camren freeze.

Footsteps. The chief could be heard on the other side, muffled by the door

“Yeah, I told you, I have a form in here for you to sign. I’ll be quick.”

Another voice murmurs in response. Two people.

Marco mouths “shit” as the door opens.

The chief stopped in his tracks, staring at Marco and Camren.

“What’s going on?” he asked, confused, his hand already reaching for the light switch.

Marco stood frozen, mind blank. Camren stepped forward, chest out, ready to bluff.

“I’ll tell you what, we have-“ Before she could finish, a flash of lightning tore through the windows, bleaching the room in white. Thunder followed immediately, shaking the walls of the hospital. The lights died in a snap, plunging them into darkness. After the thunder stuttled, there was only a deep, rolling vibration that seemed to come from inside the building.

The fire alarm erupted overhead-not the usual shrill blare, but warped, the tone bending lower and higher like a siren underwater. Dust drifted from the ceiling tiles as the floor gave a faint shudder, the filing cabinets rattling against the wall.

Marco’s walkie talkie hissed to life. As he quickly grabbed it, remembering the gang below, A burst of static, then a voice, strained and panicked:

“Get out————-the——Basement—” CRACKLE “there’s a—” CRACKLE then silence as the talkie hissed with warped laughter and the sounds of medical equipment beeping until the line went dead a moment after.

Camren turned to Marco, eyes wide in the flickering red of the emergency lights, then to the chief. “We have to get to the courtyard.”

Our goal is to empower server administrators by simplifying routine management tasks and enhancing control without adding unnecessary overhead. PatchRaptor lets you focus on what matters most: building your community and delivering great gameplay experiences.  


What you can expect:

\- Reliable automation of server and cluster operations via Discord commands

\- Secure remote console access using RCON

\- Minimal resource usage to keep your servers running smoothly

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

She said she admired me for not giving up my rescue cat and never give it up. And she said never give up on your dreams because then you die by doing so. 
 She said she would like to visit me again and I said I would like that but hopefully I won’t be in my car much longer and I would find myself over employed and playing catch up and getting ahead on my dreams.

I have been single for more than a few months and have been feeling ready to get back out there to find my future wife. I was in a long term relationship before so I haven’t had to court anyone in years, so I’m out of practice.

I went out to party with some friends for the first time in years and my cousin came along and brought her gay friend. My friend told me he saw her checking me out majorly and we actually danced all night together. I was pretty drunk and she wouldn’t make any passes at me, which my cousin said was because she doesn’t like doing anything if someone’s drunk, and she doesn’t like casual flings. Since then, my cousin actually got her permission to give me her number and we have texted all day everyday for the past week since. She from outside the city and comes by a lot so we kinda chatted about doing something when she’s here on Wednesday. We talked about anything you can name and even sent each other songs, but there is no flirting from either side. My cousin said to be her friend first and to just see where the connection goes, but I really can’t tell girls. She’s very very sweet and we have great talks, and she’s definitely one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. I don’t like to play games and waste either of our time, but I really can’t tell if I should just let things flow or if I should properly ask her out. I can’t even tell if she’s into me!

I wanna be chill and take my time, things could just develop to be more platonic and I’m okay with that, but I am very attracted to her (I think it’s pretty obvious to everyone) I just don’t wanna over step and make her uncomfortable. Any tips and tricks to kinda test the waters? I’m thinking of asking her to grab a coffee or food for real so we can have a date and time. At least we can chat outside of texting because I don’t want to be stuck in texts forever.

I’m a 25-year-old nurse living in Seattle. I would describe myself as equal parts bubbly and sarcastic, and always up for meeting new people (once I get past the initial nerves). My friends would describe me as funny, organized, dedicated, and the friend who shows up no matter what.

When I’m not at the hospital, you can usually find me thrifting, exploring coffee shops, trying new recipes (bread-making is next on my list), discovering new music, or hanging out with friends at a brewery or on a rooftop. I’m also starting a cookbook club with friends where we cook through an entire cookbook one recipe at a time... I'll be equal parts ambitious and probably chaotic lol!

I love being social and out with friends, but I also enjoy coming home to a calm, cozy space (which will hopefully one day have a cat in it).

I’m open to pretty much anything right now, from pen pals to maybe a relationship, just seeing what’s out there. I’m drawn to intelligent, hardworking people who value friendship and caring for others. If that’s you, send me a message and tell me your favorite local coffee shop or a song you think I should add to my playlist. Hope to hear from you soon :)",0,1754709865.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Chapter 1

The first thing Eli Baxter always noticed when he stepped into the St. Hartford-Aurelius Hospital building was the age of the steps and the ever-present, musty smell that lingered.

It wasn’t the sharp tang of antiseptic or the faint whiff of wet grass from the courtyard after last night’s rain. It was deeper than that, baked deep in the brick and tile of the building. Probably as dust, paper, and the lingering weight of a century’sworth of life and death pressed on the place.

They called St. Hartford-Aurelius prestigious. The locals called it something else.

Haunted.

Eli stopped in the main hallway of the annex building, where the portraits of past chiefs lined the walls in dark wooden frames. Each painted face seemed to frown similarly, regardless of the decade, with men and women alike displaying hollow eyes, some of which dated back to the 1910s.

He adjusted the strap of his bag and let his gaze drift to the brass plaques beneath the portraits. The first to always catch his eyes was Dr. Slias W. Halbrook. Chief from 1932 to 1947. His mustache was always styled strangely. Curled, smooth, and sharp, it made him resemble President Theodore Roosevelt. 

Then next to him was Dr. Lucinda V. Cairn, chief from 1947 to 1961. Her silver hair and long face pierced Halbrook'sview as her stare strangely fixed on his portrait. And finally, the last chief to retire was Dr. Michael J. Hartford. His stare was the most hollow of the 3 Eli would glance at. His portrait gives him a cold shiver whenever he stares too long at the old man's eyes through his painted glasses. But Eli soon had to shake off the cold stare as he continued on his way to clock in.

He’d been here for three months now, and he still found himself reading the names whenever he passed. His coworkers didn’t give the portraits a second glance, but he always had an eye for the past. Or maybe, the past had an eye for him.

It was probably why he never outgrew the feeling that the walls of the building were always listening. 

He wasn’t the only one from his small hometown in West Virginia to end up here.

By some cosmic accident, or maybe fate, the old gang had been selected for internships at the hospital. Marco Vance, Tasha Monroe, and Felix Price. Marco was tall and quiet. He was famous for his long nights in the anatomy labs, apparently unfazed by the cadaver smell that made half their classmates gag. Tasha had an annoyingly sharp tongue and a competitive mindset. Usually bouncing between surgery, observation, and campus life. She always had a joke ready to cover her nerves. Felix, who somehow managed to secure a spot in the pathology track, was known to keep recordings of surgeries. A big tech nerd as well as a chemistry nerd. He experimented with tech and medicine with the same enthusiasm he once had for sneaking into abandoned barns as a youth. And now here they all were, in the same town again, after close to a decade apart from each other.

They’d spent middle school together as a locally famous ghost hunting group, ""the specter chasers,"" though they’d never found a real ghost.

What they did find were Owls that scared them half to death in an abandoned silo. A “haunted house” that turned out to be a hunting cabin with a leaky roof. And once, a lonely old woman named Virginia who let them poke around her property for company and warned them to “always respect the dead.”

Those summers were long gone, buried under exams, student debt, and late-night study sessions, but something about St. Hartford-Aurelius brought some of those memories back. Maybe it was the way the workers talked about the place, saying to ""never find yourself alone in the annex stairwell"" or the ever-so-famous ""if you walk the halls empty on night shift. An old woman calls your name for help.""

Eli had smiled and ignored it. All hospitals had ghost stories.

He found Felix in the cafeteria that afternoon, leaning against the lunch rail as he waited.

“Hey, future Dr. Baxter,” Felix said, his grin the same as when they were twelve. “How's work going today?”

Eli rolled his eyes. “I’ve been here three months, and I swear my ass can't be spread more across this place. I'm needed here, then there. Why can't I be needed for a 15-minute coffee break?""

“Tell me about it,” Felix said, leaning in. “This place has started to give me insomnia. Night shift isn't for the weak, I'llsay that,"" he shuffled, grabbing his first meal in 18 hours. Marco appeared from the side entrance with Tasha in tow, both murmuring to each other quietly when they saw Eli and Felix leaving the line.

“You called a meeting?” she said, mock-annoyed. “Please tell me this is about something stupid. I need something stupid in my life.”

Felix’s grin widened. “Oh, it’s stupid. But it’s also… us.”

Eli knew what he meant before he said it, but he was also focused on how Tasha approached him.

""w-wait a meeting? And I wasn't told whats up"" Felix digs in his coat and takes out his pager ""I was just tellin them before you walked in the cafeteria. 5 seonds from telling you- but friends. i think its time to bring back..."" he held his breath ""THE SPECTURE CHASERS!!"" the cafateria went slient for a moment before everyone went back to talking amongst themselves as Felix held his expression of excitment.

Marco sighed. “We re-what? Just no. We're in medical school. We don’t have time for—”

“Ghosts?” Tasha cut in, smirking. “We made time for them in eighth grade. Might as well make time now. It’s tradition.”

Marco rubbed his nose bridge, then looked to Tasha, ""We've grown out of that, we're not the Ghostbusters anymore. Werescientists like them, but-""

The table sprawled into a quiet, heated argument. Eli usually learned to disengage from the group's silly arguments. Helooked up at the Annex windows, where rain streaked down the glass like tears. For a moment, he had seen one of the dark windows on the top floor flicker like someone had just moved out of sight.

He blinked, and it was gone...

The long-awaited next meeting of the specter chasers has begun.

They lingered over their food as silence crept its way, with Marco getting the last hushed words. ""Casper wouldn't even be friendly... he's got attachments..."" Marco sighed as Eli couldn't figure out whether the idea was half joke or half serious. Felix was all in ""I've been wanting to tweak on some gear I bought from kinda sketchy downtown pawnshops and oh, this army surplus. Tasha was excited but said she’d think about it as she doesn't have much free time. Marco muttered something about surgeries and research for the week. ""Just save 911 pages for living people, ok?"" He left first.

Eli stayed quiet, but the idea followed him from the day into the night.

He didn’t sleep well either.

At some point, he drifted into a restless, lucid-like dream where the hospital halls stretched endlessly. The portraits watched him as he walked, their eyes following, mouths slightly open, now speaking nonsense.

Down a stairwell he’d never seen before, he found a locked cellar door.

From the other side, an old woman's voice whispered his name in a gravelly, wet tone.

“Eeeeeellllliiii…”

He turned the handle as a cold chill seeped through his fingers.

And then, far off in the dark, he heard a deep, low roar from a dusty, large furnace as it came to life with fire. The fire grew hot, hot enough for Eli to feel suffocated. Sweat poured from his forehead as the furnace blew open.

Eli woke with a start, heart hammering and soaked in sweat.

The room was quiet, but he could still smell smoke in the air. He looked at his clock, panting as it read ""5:45 AM""; he had to work at 6:15...

# 

Eli’s dream stayed with him long after the sun came up.

The whisper, the cold doorknob, the groan of a furnace that felt too close...he shook it off over breakfast, but every time he saw the Annex building out the cafeteria window, a little shiver ran down his back. 

By midweek, he told himself it was just a stress overload, possibly due to excessive coffee consumption. The medical field had a way of wearing down even the toughest students and workers. But the feeling didn’t go away.

If anything, it grew. 

The first time he noticed it was on Wednesday evening, as he walked back from the lab toward the staff locker room. Thehospital felt… different at night.

Daytime St. Hartford-Aurelius was all hustle and light, bustling interns, rolling gurneys, and blaring ambulances.

Nighttime St. Hartford-Aurelius was a hollow, breathing being in itself.

He entered the staff room, and the vending machines hummed in the distance. Footsteps echoed longer than they should. Fluorescent lights flickered like the building was blinking.

Eli passed the long row of portraits in the annex during his exit, and for the first time, he caught his reflection in the glass. It looked paler than he felt. 

He was halfway to convincing himself to try to laugh it off when a soft voice broke the silence.

""Good evening, Eli...""

He nearly dropped his bag.

An older nurse, Paula, had appeared behind the counter next to the portraits. She was in her fifties, cheerful but with permanent eye bags.

“You look like you saw a ghost,” she said, amused.

He exhaled. “You, sorry uh. You just startled me. Thought I was alone.”

“Never alone in a hospital,” Paula said, tapping her temple. “Even when you are.”

He hesitated, then decided to take the chance.

“Hey, Paula… does this place… feel weird to you at night?”

She laughed softly. “Weird? Honey, this place is nothing but weird. Old buildings always talk to themselves. Pipes, vents, AC. People just… add stories to the noise.”

“Stories?”

“You know. ""The annex lady,"" or she's so-called.""

Eli blinked. “…Annex Lady?”

Paula leaned in conspiratorially. “They say if you walk the Annex stairwell alone at night, a woman calls your name. Sounds like she’s right behind you. Old rumor. Been here since I was a student.”

Eli forced a chuckle, but it didn’t reach his stomach. He left her at the counter with his thoughts buzzing. He looked back at the building as lightning from a small storm flickered in the distance. 

Chapter 2

By Friday, he’d started on night shifts, and the hospital was emptier than he’d ever seen it.

The halls felt longer. Shadows stretched across tiles like dark water. 

He told himself as he made his way in: *This is the perfect time to look into the stories. Paula reminded me of one old lady who let us just scare raccoons, but she was kind. Always respect the dead...*

He soon imagined the old thrill—flashlights, cameras, the four of them whispering in the dark like kids again.

Then he thought about his dream from a few nights before.

Eli turned down the North hall of the Annex, where most of the rooms were for recovery patients. It was dim and quiet except for the steady beep of monitors behind closed doors.

Then he heard it.

""Eeeeellliiiii.....""

Gravelly, low, dragging over his nerves like a cold finger.

He froze.

The hallway was empty, lined with low-lit doorways and shadows. He swallowed hard and followed the sound to the room next to him, room 208. His shoes scuffed on the tile as he raised it in hesitation. 

His hand was hovering over the knob. The door was slightly open as he pushed it. His pulse raced. He twisted the handle and peeked in.

A small, frail elderly woman sat up in bed, blinking at him.

“Oh, thank God,” she whispered. “Honey, I need to use the restroom, and I can’t find the button for the nurse.”

Relief hit so hard he almost laughed, but it came out as a shaky exhale.

“Right-uh-of course,” he said, quickly pressing the call button for her. “I’ve got you,” but thought to himself, ""yeah yeah, not so much in the mood for ass wiping...""

As the nurse came 2 seconds later, he left the room. After leaving, he caught his reflection in the window. He noticed behind him, in the reflection, the door to 208 was wide open with the nurse covered in blood as she held the pink wrinkly lung of the old woman now dead and ripped open on her bed. Elis' eyes widened as he stood still at the reflected scene. But as he blinked, he saw what he'd see seconds later after a quick and sudden spin. The nurse was holding the old woman on the edge of the bed as she did her business in a pan. The old woman looked at Eli at the same time ""...I-is something wrong, dear?"" the old woman asked. Eli thought on his feet, ""I just uh, well, from experience, or from what I've noticed, is if you tuck the remote in your sheets, sticking out, it won't fall."" he left in a rush to clock into his already chaotic shift...

Eli leaned against the bathroom sink, splashing cold water on his face. His shirt clung to his back with nervous sweat.

He wasn’t sure if he wanted to laugh or puke.

*I saw it. I swear I saw it. The reflection. The blood. That nurse holding a lung like it was a prop, a plaything like it wasn't. It wasn't a part of someone. But the room had been fine.* 

His mind raced as he looked at his reflection, and the door creaked behind him.

“Hey… you okay?”

He jumped, turning to see Carmen, a night-shift RN who always had her brown hair pulled back in the same messy bun. She leaned on the doorframe with a worried look and one eyebrow raised.

“You look like you either saw a ghost,” she said, “or you just ran a mile.”

Eli forced a weak chuckle. “Maybe both.”

She smirked. “You get used to it. Nights mess with your head. Lights, quiet halls, restless patients. Makes the brain… fill in blanks.”

He began to leave as Carmen left first. They walked down the hall to the main desk on the floor, where Carmen grabbed a board. Eli hesitated, then decided to test the waters.

“So Carmen, have you ever… seen anything weird? Like, weird?”

“…You’re not the first to ask. People talk. About the Annex mostly.”

“The Annex?” he echoed, trying to sound casual.

“Mmhm. Night shift’s playground.” She leaned closer, her voice dropping. “They say you can hear the Annex Lady sometimes. Calls your name as she knows you. Usually when it’s empty.”

Eli swallowed, his heart thudding with equal parts dread and excitement.

“I, uh… might’ve heard something tonight.”

Carmen grinned. “Congrats, you’re officially one of us now.”

""Wait, so, you've heard it too?""

Carmen had seen a doctor pass by behind Eli and had given him a nod 

""I'll tell you more later, gotta go. See ya, Eli.""

She paced down the hall with the doctor as Eli continued with his shift, the investigation left to continue later.

The shift dragged into the early morning hours, the hospital quieter than it had any right to be. Every wheel on a gurney seemed too loud. Every elevator chime made Eli’s shoulders twitch.

He found Carmen again near the nurse’s station. She was logging vitals into a chart.

“So…” he began, lowering his voice. 

Carmen was exhausted from the shift as she stopped Eli. ""I know, I know. And let me say, I don't like to talk about creepy stuff at this place because it jinxes us."" Carmen sipped her coffee before licking her lips. ""It'll be a while before I use the basement shortcut.""

""What happened?"" Eli asked with a nervous but interested grin and crossed his arms

""About 5 hours after I had seen you last, I used the shortcut to get to the west building in the basement, you know the quiet corridor that used to lead to old hospital facilities decades ago.""

Eli didn't know about the shortcut but agreed to continue the conversation, ""Yes, of course.""

""But the door by the, I think, was some...cremation room...I heard weird things.”

Eli leaned in slightly. “…Cremation room?”

Before she could answer, a deep voice spoke behind them:

“Talking about ghosts again, Carmen?”

Both of them jumped.

Eli turned to see a tall, silver-haired man in a dark coat standing just past the hall’s fluorescent light. His sharp, square glasses reflected a sliver of it, catching Eli in a stare that felt heavier than it should.

“Chief Greaves,” Carmen said quickly, straightening up. “Just making conversation.”

Greaves’s gaze shifted to Eli. His tone was calm, polite—but iron under velvet.

“Mr. Baxter, I hope you’re settling into the night shift well.” his voice echoed deep in vibrations and tone, the deepest Eli had ever heard.

“Yes, sir,” Eli said automatically.

“Good. A word of advice,” the chief said as he started to walk past them, his shoes nearly silent on the tile. “We heal the living here. Leave the dead to rest. Talking about… things… stirs up the wrong kind of attention. For the staff. And for the patients.”

He gave the faintest nod before disappearing around the corner.

Carmen let out a long, slow breath. “…Told you the place gets to people.”

Eli stared down the empty hall, the echo of the chief’s footsteps fading.

*He didn’t say ghosts weren’t real,* Eli thought. *He just said… leave them alone.*

And somehow, that made Eli more certain than ever that he’d seen exactly what he thought he saw.

Eli stared at his pager for a long minute, thumb hovering over the send button.

*Maybe I imagined it. Sleep-deprived brain, shadows on glass, hallucination. That’s what Marco would say.*

But the smell of smoke from his dream. The whisper in the Annex. The reflection of the nurse holding a lung like it was a toy… He shivered. It felt way too real.

He’d wanted proof since he was twelve. He had spent half his childhood sneaking into barns and abandoned houses with his friends, chasing cold spots and raccoons that he swore were spirits. Now, for the first time, he might have something.

If he didn’t call the others, he’d regret it.

Eli had sent the message in all caps: **911 SPECTER CHASERS MEETING. TONIGHT.**

Chapter 3

Marco almost didn’t come. He had an early lab in the morning and had muttered something about *“being too old for this crap”* when he walked in, but he showed up anyway. Felix’s living room was their unofficial HQ, decorated with mismatched furniture and the faint smell of asian takeout.

Felix had cleared the coffee table for “mission prep,” which currently consisted of an RCA camera, two flashlights, and half a dozen modified project equipment he had spent half a decade working on.

“So,” Marco said as he dropped into the armchair. “What’s the emergency? Did somebody see a ghost cat in the Annex?” he said, arms raised sarcastically.

“Sit,” Eli said, more serious than usual. “I… I did see something.”

That got Tasha’s attention immediately. She perched on the arm of the couch, crossing her arms.

“Define ‘something,’” she said.

Eli hesitated. He could feel the words crawling up his throat like they were too heavy to say.

“I saw… a reflection. A nurse. Holding a lung. The patient was ripped open...but only in the window reflection. When I looked back, she was fine. Perfectly fine. Just pissing in a pan.”

Silence. Felix’s grin slowly widened.

“YES,” he said, clapping his hands once. “Finally, our first legit *polter-flashback-vision-hallucination* or whatever. Dude, this is *it!*”

Marco groaned, rubbing his face. “Or… you were tired. Night shift does that. I'd know, Eli just needs to fix his sleep schedule because he didn't prep for the night shift.""

Eli interrupted. “Carmen also told me about the shortcut in the basement, and she said she heard stuff too. I’m not imagining all of this. I know it.”

Marco's eyebrows raised as he crossed his arms, sinking into the couch more interested. ""Carmen said this. Ok. Go on.""

Eli put his head and hands down. ""Well, she, she didn't say much. The chief interrupted as he heard our conversation about it all. But she was a little irritated by the end of her shift.""

Marco scratched his stubble-chin. ""She's not usually irritable after work. She's perkier at the end of her shift if anything..""

There was an awkward silence in the air as they all thought, waiting for someone to weigh in on what to do.

Felix leaned forward, eyes sparkling. “So we’re splitting up. We have to split up.”

Marco looked a little betrayed. “Excuse me?”

“No."" Tasha pointed her fingers to her head, then to Feliex. ""It makes sense,” Tasha said, sliding off the couch arm to pace. “We cover more ground. Eli and I ask around, dig up stories from staff during day shifts. Then Felix and Marco-”

“Why, Marco, and why also Feliex?” Marco said, pointing his finger at Felix's eyes, which were fixed on Tasha.

Tasha ignoredmarco as she went on. “You and Felix check the basement. Use the shortcut, explore, and see if you can find anything. If there’s nothing, fine. If there’s something…”

Felix practically vibrated with excitement. “*Evidence.* Actual evidence. Finally!”

Marco sighed, defeated. “I hate that I already know I’m going to regret this.”

“Good,” Tasha said. “Then it’s a proper Specter Chaser's mission.”

Eli finally let a smile creep in.

“Alright. We do this weekend. Agreed?”

They all nodded, though Marco’s was more reluctant than the others.

Felix cried with metal hand gestures, “Operation Specter Chasers: Medical Mayhem… is a GO.”

Tasha rolled her eyes. “We’re gonna need a better name than that.”

Eli and Tasha arrived early that morning, notebooks in hand and badges clipped to their coats to give them the sheen of professional curiosity. The plan was simple: split up, gather stories, and meet up before the night shift to share findings.

Eli started in the Annex, where the air always felt a degree colder than the main wings. He found an older African American orderly named Henry mopping near the stairwell. Henry had been at St. Hartford-Aurelius for nearly twenty years.

Eli approached him calmly and asked blankly, “Hey, Henry, have you ever worked night shifts?” Eli asked, trying to sound casual as he leaned against the wall, knowing this aging man had worked the shift before.

Henry chuckled a little and rolled his eyes. “Kid, I’ve seen more night shifts than you've seen the night sky. Why?""

Eli hesitated, then shrugged. “Just… uh. Hearing the stories,” he chuckled as Henry stationed himself on his mop, holding one leg up as he leaned on his mop. His voice lowered. “Oh, sure, the stories. It couldn't be you mean the...Annex Lady?”

Eli’s heart skipped. “That’s… a real thing people talk about?”

Henry laughed, “Oh, it’s real all right, alright. Or real enough to keep me on the first floor at night when I can be. I heard her once, years ago. Thought someone was whisperin' my name...right behind me in the stairwell... no one there...” He shivered, even now. “The place talks to you sometimes. You listen too hard, you won’t sleep again.”

Eli scribbled a note, thanking him before moving on, his pulse quickened by the simple confirmation.

Meanwhile, Tasha took the main lobby and surgical wing, where she cornered an anesthesiologist named Dr. Weldman during his break.

She approached him, mouth stuffed with the first food he had in over 12 hours, and plopped her tray down. He rolled her eyes as she gave him what small bit of attention he had to her.

“Be honest with me, Doc...” she said with her trademark smirk. “This place haunted?”

He laughed at first, then faltered a little more when he saw she was serious. “I don’t know about haunted… but weird things tend to happen from my experience. Patients say doors open by themselves, knocking on high building windows-hey, I swear I saw an elevator go down to the basement by itself once. Nobody inside.”

“Maintenance issue?” Tasha said with a raised eyebrow 

“That’s what I told myself. But then…” He hesitated. “Two nights later, I was on call. Needed to take the basement shortcut. I know I heard someone screaming down there. I ran down, thinking it was a patient or staff in trouble. Theplace was empty. But the screaming… it was like it got trapped in the walls. So loud too, the loudest I've heard.”

Tasha kept her usual playful tone hidden until now, but the truth in her eyes glimmers a bit of excitement. “So… would you say that this place is haunted?” A smirk broke from her serious look as Dr. Weldman chuckled, rubbing his face.“Let’s just say… I don’t go down there unless I have to anymore.” Tasha let the doctor eat as she left the table, thanking him for his time.

By late afternoon, the two met in the cafeteria, their notes spread between them like pieces of a puzzle. Eli slides his biggest note forward. ""Henry swears he heard whispers in the Annex stairwell. Avoids the basement entirely.""

Tasha moves her small stack. ""Dr. Weldman told me the Elevator to the basement moves on its own. Distant blood-curdling screaming with no source."" They shuffle more, adding to the piles of staff who mentioned the lady in the annexor the basement.

“That’s all… a bit more than I expected,” Tasha admitted, leaning back. “I would've thought we'd have just a few bored nurses making up stories.”

“Or…” Eli leaned in. “…we’re onto something.”

Before Tasha could respond, the cafeteria doors hissed open. Carmen walked in, hair in its usual messy bun, coffee in hand, and looking ready for another long night. She spots Eli sitting with Tasha and decides to say hi before seeing the mess of papers.

“Well, well, you two plotting something?”

“Just catching up on a few things,” Tasha darted her eyes to Camren from the papers. “Eli said you’re the person to talk to about… the Annex lady.”

Carmen groaned, sliding into her coat in a shiver. “Oh, great. You’ve dragged me into ghost hour.”

“Come on,” Eli said. “We’re trying to get the full story. Basement shortcut, Annex Lady… whatever’s out there.”

Carmen sipped her coffee, watching them over the rim like she was debating if they deserved the story. Finally, she set it down.

“I’ll tell you this much: I used that basement shortcut for years. Then one night, walking past the old furnace room, I heard… humming. Soft. Like a lullaby. I thought maybe it was a radio left on. But the air down there...” she shook her head, “it felt heavy. I didn’t stick around to find out more.”

Eli and Tasha exchanged a glance. Neither of them had heard about humming before.

“Anyway,” Carmen said, starting to stretch the shiver off, “if you two are going poking around that basement, don’t go alone. And don’t go after midnight.”

The words lingered as Carmen walked off to start her shift.

Eli stared at Tasha, a chill running through him despite the warmth of the cafeteria.

“She’s not joking.”

“Nope,” Tasha said, grinning despite herself. “And now I kinda want to hear the lullaby for myself.”

 ## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a whitening toothpaste hinges on several crucial features. From the abrasive agents used to the inclusion of advanced technologies, understanding these elements is essential for selecting the right product.

**Abrasive Agents:** These are the key ingredients responsible for physically removing surface stains.

Different toothpastes utilize varying abrasive agents, such as hydrated silica, calcium carbonate, or alumina. The effectiveness and potential for enamel wear depend on the particle size and hardness of these agents. High-quality whitening toothpastes carefully balance stain removal with enamel protection, using finely milled abrasives that gently polish the teeth without causing damage.

**Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration:** A potent whitening agent, hydrogen peroxide chemically breaks down stains.

The concentration of hydrogen peroxide in whitening toothpastes typically ranges from 1% to 10%. Higher concentrations generally lead to faster and more dramatic results, but they also increase the risk of tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. Many leading brands incorporate stabilized hydrogen peroxide formulations to maximize whitening efficacy while minimizing potential side effects.

**Fluoride Content:** Essential for strengthening enamel and preventing cavities.

Fluoride is a crucial component of any effective toothpaste, including whitening varieties. It helps to remineralize tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks and decay. The optimal fluoride concentration, typically around 0.243% as sodium fluoride, ensures both cavity protection and overall oral health.

**Specialized Ingredients for Stain Prevention:** Some toothpastes include ingredients that create a protective barrier against future stains.

These ingredients, such as polyphosphates or copolymers, help to prevent stain-causing molecules from adhering to the tooth surface. This proactive approach not only enhances the whitening effect but also contributes to long-term maintenance of a brighter smile.

**Advanced Technology for Enhanced Whitening:** Innovations like blue light technology or PAP (phthalimido-peroxy-caproic acid) offer alternative whitening mechanisms.

These technologies represent a departure from traditional abrasive and peroxide-based whitening. Blue light technology, often incorporated into whitening kits, accelerates the stain-breaking process. PAP, a non-peroxide whitening agent, provides a gentler option for individuals with sensitive teeth.

**Flavor and Formulation:** A pleasant taste and smooth texture enhance the overall brushing experience.

The flavor and formulation of a toothpaste significantly impact user compliance. Refreshing mint flavors are popular choices, while smooth, non-gritty textures contribute to a more comfortable and enjoyable brushing experience. Some toothpastes also incorporate ingredients to combat bad breath and promote fresh breath.

 ## Core Benefits

The best whitening toothpastes offer a range of benefits beyond simply brightening your smile. These advantages contribute to overall oral health and boost confidence.

**Visibly Whiter Teeth:** The primary benefit is a noticeable improvement in tooth shade.

Users can expect to see a gradual but significant reduction in surface stains, leading to a brighter, more radiant smile. The extent of whitening depends on the toothpaste's formulation, the severity of existing stains, and the consistency of use.

**Improved Oral Hygiene:** Whitening toothpastes maintain overall oral health.

In addition to whitening, these toothpastes effectively remove plaque and bacteria, contributing to healthier gums and reduced risk of cavities. The inclusion of fluoride further strengthens enamel and protects against tooth decay.

**Increased Confidence:** A whiter smile enhances self-esteem and social interactions.

Many users report feeling more confident and comfortable in social situations after using whitening toothpaste. A brighter smile can have a positive impact on self-perception and overall well-being.

**Stain Prevention:** Protection against future discoloration.

The inclusion of stain-prevention ingredients helps to maintain the achieved whitening effect and prevent new stains from forming. This proactive approach contributes to long-term maintenance of a brighter smile.

**Gentle on Enamel:** Formulations that minimize the risk of sensitivity.

Leading whitening toothpastes are formulated to be gentle on enamel, minimizing the risk of tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. They often incorporate ingredients like potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride to soothe and protect sensitive teeth.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is crucial for building trust and providing clear information.

**How long does it take to see results with whitening toothpaste?**
    Results typically become visible within 2-4 weeks of consistent use, brushing twice daily. However, the exact timeframe may vary depending on the toothpaste's formulation, the severity of existing stains, and individual factors.

**Can whitening toothpaste damage tooth enamel?**
    While some whitening toothpastes can be abrasive, leading brands prioritize enamel protection by using finely milled abrasives and incorporating remineralizing agents like fluoride. Look for toothpastes with a Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) score below 250 to minimize the risk of enamel wear.

**Is whitening toothpaste suitable for people with sensitive teeth?**
    Many whitening toothpastes are formulated for sensitive teeth, incorporating ingredients like potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride to reduce sensitivity. However, it's always best to consult with a dentist before using any whitening product if you have sensitive teeth or other oral health concerns.

**Can whitening toothpaste remove all types of stains?**
    Whitening toothpastes are most effective at removing surface stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other common culprits. They are less effective at removing intrinsic stains, which originate from within the tooth structure. For intrinsic stains, professional whitening treatments may be necessary.

Yesterday i was on the bus with my parents coming back from a lovely day out (we went to a zoo and had a meal in a local restaurant) and my mother said to me:

""Thank you for taking us out today darling, we really enjoyed! when are we going to see again?"" i replied with ""Whenever you like really?""

*She then dropped the bombshell!!* 

""We would come and visit but we aren't allowed to come over to your house are we..""

Took me a few seconds to process what she said

""You know you can come over any time you like!?"" 

She then said ""We will be over tomorrow""

For a little bit of context, im 37 and ive been living on my own for about 15 years. My sister lives 7 doors up from me. My parents live about 20 miles away and are both in their late 70s.
 they used to come and visit me and my sister pretty much every day. 

Then 2 years ago they stopped coming over but carried on visiting my sister and they also stopped telling me when they were in the area so i had no clue when they were with her.
This went on for a year or so and i started to think there was something a little wrong but i just chalked it up to them no longer driving (they lost the car in an accident shortly after dad had his heart attack a year ago).

So i started to meet them for coffee and meals/walks etc. whenever i wasn't working (i work from home). 

I started to hear about them meeting up with my sister at her house and them having BBQ's and party's with her and her kids, and i just thought they didn't have time to visit me..

I go to visit them as often as i physically can and i love them to pieces but to be honest we haven't seen much of eachother in the past 2 years but i do phone them daily.

I'm still unsure exactly why they thought they couldn't come over and they haven't mentioned it in the past 2 years at all and i absolutely hate arguments so i probably will never actually ask them why they thought they couldn't come over to see me but i have a feeling they might have taken something i said out of context! 
I remember saying a couple of years ago that i didn't want them over because i was in the process of painting my living room. Which i finished in a day, i even sent them pics of the new colors. But other than that i cant remember saying they couldn't come over. 

They were even complaining that i wasn't seeing them often enough in that time too, there were many times i felt like saying ""Well you come and see my sister 4 times a week"" but i didn't want to hurt their feelings or risk falling out with them.

Well now I've explained.. Its time for the reason im typing this in this sub. I would like to know would i be the asshole if i got upset over this? Or should i be the one apologizing to them?",10,1754709295.0,AmItheAsshole,47,0.66,False

1mlf3ft,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/opinion/seed-oils-nutrition-ingredients-science.html,NYTimes Opinion - Dr Emily Oster - The Trouble With French Fries Is Not the Oil,"Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is right when he says that chronic disease is on the rise in America and that our food system is at least partly to blame. Where he and his “Make America Healthy Again” movement err is in relying on flawed evidence to target particular foods.

Let’s take seed oils. Mr. Kennedy has claimed that oils made from seeds — sunflower, safflower, canola — have “poisoned"" Americans, and are “one of the driving causes” of the obesity epidemic.

The fear over seed oils stems from the fact that they tend to be high in one type of unsaturated fat, omega-6 fatty acids, whereas olive oils have more omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have found that people who consume a higher ratio of omega 6 to omega-3 fatty acids in their diet tend to have worse health.

The problem is that most of those studies are poorly designed to show how omega-6 fatty acids, or seed oils that contain them, are actually causing the negative health effects.

Seed oils are prevalent in processed and fast foods. That’s because they are cheap and also have a high smoke point, which is good for frying. There’s evidence that many ultraprocessed foods harm our health, but is the problem the seed oils, or the foods they are used in? A meal from Taco Bell is more likely to contain seed oils than a salad and chicken breast cooked at home with olive oil, but the oils probably aren’t the reason the former is less healthy.

People who eat a lot of ultraprocessed foods may differ in other ways that affect health, like their education levels, exercise habits and whether they smoke. Research papers commonly address this concern by trying to adjust for differences across individuals, but they simply can’t control for all the factors that are associated with different dietary choices.

It’s not just seed oils. Studies that show only patterns, not cause and effect, are pervasive in the field of nutrition research. Those headlines linking red meat to cancer or coffee to longevity are based on studies that find connections between foods and health but that cannot determine if one causes the other. When we fixate on individual foods or ingredients, we miss the bigger picture — implying that chronic disease would be fixed by, say, removing food dyes from Skittles.

Often, with better data, the conclusions of nutrition studies based on observational findings turn out to be wrong. For decades, people thought fat was the enemy and dietary guidelines encouraged people to eat less of it, and more carbohydrates. Then, a landmark study in 2006 showed that women randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet were no less likely to suffer from heart disease or stroke than people who ate more fat.

It is not that we know nothing about nutrition. A large randomized trial has shown benefits of a Mediterranean style-diet, and evidence from high-quality nutrition studies has shown a diet high in ultraprocessed foods results in eating more, leading to weight gain. The general advice to eat mostly whole foods and not too much is reasonable. Where the evidence falls apart is when it turns to specific foods.
If it is so bad, why is this deeply flawed evidence so widely produced and so popular in the media? One reason: These kind of studies make health changes seem easy. If only you quit seed oils or drink more coffee, you’ll be healthier. Focusing on individual ingredients also benefits policymakers who want to claim wins. There is no good evidence to suggest sugar is healthier than high fructose corn syrup, and yet fear of the latter has allowed Mr. Kennedy to claim a victory when Coca-Cola promised to offer American consumers a version of Coke sweetened with cane sugar instead of corn syrup.

A skeptical person may ask: If association studies are all we have, shouldn’t we rely on them until we know more? What’s the harm with cutting out seed oils?

Relying on bad evidence can lead to significant mistakes. Correlational evidence about the health risks of butter led people to substitute margarine instead; at the time, this contained trans fats, which turned out to be more concerning than butter for heart health. Mr. Kennedy has promoted replacing seed oils with tallow, nevermind that the saturated fat in tallow is probably worse for one’s health. Worse, the current panic over seed oils has led some parents to worry about seed oil use in infant formula. These oils are necessary for the formula to mimic the nutrient composition of breast milk, but there are now parents seeking to make their own formula to avoid them.

Given the poor state of health in the United States, we desperately need better nutrition data. Scientists need to stop producing and amplifying so much flawed research. Journals should be more skeptical of publishing this research; media organizations should cover it less.

That will free up resources for more creative and ambitious studies that can establish not just associations, but whether something is actually causing the health effect in question. An example is a recent publication in the journal Science that examined the impact of sugar exposure in childhood by comparing children born during sugar rationing in Britain after World War II or just after the rationing ended. They found that early sugar exposure leads to more disease later in life.
The National Institutes of Health should fund a large-scale, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of different diets on health. The study could evaluate not only health outcomes, but also how easy it was for people to stick to the recommended diet, perhaps the most significant challenge in changing people’s eating habits.

Such a study, which would ideally include perhaps one million people followed for several years, would be extremely expensive. But in the end, we would actually learn what drives health outcomes. If the current administration wants to get serious about fixing nutrition science, this is the place to start.",1,1754709184.0,StopEatingSeedOils,0,1.0,False
1mlf36n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mlf36n/a_family_man/,A Family Man,"***Quick Note:*** Hi everyone! This is my first time publishing a story on reddit, not too sure how everything works on here. However, here is a story I wrote while in seminary down in New Orleans. I'm not a huge fan of this story, but it's a finished story, lol. I hope you enjoy!



“You ready to head out? I think I’m finished for the night, I have work in the morning.” Randy said to his friend.

“Yeah,” Geoffrey finished his beer, “I’m ready to head out.” Geoffrey threw his coat on and pulled out his phone. The two buddies walked out from the bar together.

“Oh, I meant to ask you,” Randy started, “You and the missus got anything special planned for the start of the new year?”

“Funny you asked, Laurel and I have our anniversary this month,” Geoffrey answered. “It’s coming up a few weeks from now. We’ve already planned everything out for the day, but I have something in mind for us the evening before. Like a little romantic surprise to lay out the tinder and set sparks for the kindling, you know?”

“Oh-ho, look at you plannin’ ahead. I may have received a little more info than I needed, but I love hearin’ that for you two. I’ll be sure to plan the bar night around that.” Randy said with enthusiasm, “I hope your anniversary is beautiful for the both of you. What’s it been, nine years?”

“Eleven years,” Geoffrey corrected him with a smirk.

“Good God! Where did the last two years go for me?” Randy chuckled, he looked up and saw a man rush around the corner of the bar. “Hey watch out, Geoff!”

Before Geoffrey could fully spin his head around, the man knocked Geoffrey to the ground. “Sweet mother! Hey bu-.” Geoffrey attempted to yell at the man while trying to get up from the ground, but by the time he couldn't get anything out the man was booking it.

“I look forward to that day!” The man’s voice echoed off into the distance with glee as he kept running.

“Hey Geoff, you alright?” Randy asked while lifting Geoffrey off the ground, “The nerve of some people nowadays.”

“Tssshh,” Geoffrey winced while turning to look at his buddy.

“What? You alright?”

“Yeah, I think Usain Bolt down there nicked my shoulder.”

“Here, let me check.”

“You hear what he said after trucking me?”

“Yeah, looks like he nicked you in the shoulder. Pretty good cut he gave you there. Head inside and go grab some paper towels,” Randy analyzed the cut and blood trickling down his friends shoulder. “And yeah, I heard him. Don’t worry about it though, just go grab paper towels or first aid and clean up.”

“Weird. Thanks Randy.” Geoffrey went back inside the bar.

\_\_\_\_\_

“Alright, baby.” Geoffrey calls to his wife, “I hope you have a wonderful day today.” Geoffrey finishes by kissing his wife.

“I cannot wait for tomorrow,” Laurel responds. “ I am so thankful for this man that I married.”

“You’re telling me. Have you looked at yourself in the mirror recently?”

“There’s the cheese I was looking for,” Laurel giggles at her husband, embracing him ever so closer.

“Where’s my boy?” Geoffrey asks.

“He’s in his room playing with his toys,” Laurel answers with a smile.

Geoffrey walked into his son’s room, seeing him in his pajamas playing with his toy cars. “Hey, Bobo! I’m heading off to work. Come over here and give your old man a hug.” His son drops everything to run and embrace his dad.

“Bye Dad, I love you!” Geoffrey’s son exclaims.

“I love you too, Samson. I’ll see you later this afternoon.”

“Are you still going to show me how to shoot the twenty-two?”

“Oh, absolutely! I need my future hunting buddy ready for the field!” Geoffrey’s excitement matched that of his son’s.

“Yessss!” His son excitedly exclaims once again.

Laurel comes around the corner and lingers in the doorway as Geoffrey stands up. “Okay, baby.” Geoffrey says, “I can’t wait to see you again.”

Laurel whispered to Geoffrey, “Me neither: have a good day.” She planted another kiss on him as he left for work.

The sun shone on Geoffrey’s face. It was a beautiful day, but the wind powerfully blew through the trees. A strong gust propelled over Geoffrey’s house tossing the tree tops towards the sun. Geoffrey looked up toward them. He heard them bustle and move carelessly from the wind. Even the bushes behind him rustled around careless and free, yet his tie barely fluttered.

“Winds coming from behind the house: The West.” Geoffrey was talking to himself again. He smirked, “I knew Boy Scouts was useful. I know which direction the wind comes from.” Geoffrey stuck out his chest a little and got in his car.

\_\_\_\_\_

Geoffrey closed his car door. It echoed across the parking lot. He walked toward the stairs of the parking garage and heard another car door slam. 

“I wonder if that’s Randy.” He walked over to Randy’s normal parking spot and saw his vehicle. “Good to see he made the early bird special. I guess he couldn’t wait on me before getting to work. I’ll see him soon enough.” As he turned back towards the garage steps, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed someone walking with a hood over their head. He couldn't see the person's face at all. “Weird,” Geoff thought, “he must be new here.” He thought nothing else about it and moved toward the stairwell.

He opened the door to the steps and began walking down them. About mid-way down, he heard the door to the stairway open and shut. The further he went down, the louder the footsteps became. The footsteps came closer to Geoffrey, but it unnerved him. A minor panic came over Geoff; his imagination carelessly wandered closer to fear. The footstep’s rhythm increased, surpassing his own. The echo increased the veracious reality of the footsteps inevitability. He began to speed up.

Panic and confusion overwhelmed Geoff. Instinctually and irrationally, the exit door became his security. The last flight of stairs, the one he casually took every day, was like drudging through tar as he stumbled over a few of his steps. He couldn’t get out of that stairwell fast enough.

Slamming on the push bar, Geoff made it through. Pacing himself a few meters away, he turned around to see who would walk through. He looked intently at the door window, breathing heavily. A viscous minute passed. Then, another minute trudged through his mind. Finally, the last minute finished the race through his mind. Geoff stood there and caught his breath. “Well, I guess a little cardio will come in handy for tonight, heh,” Geoffrey chuckled to himself. He wiped some of the sweat from his brow, turned away from the door, and continued his daily workflow.

\*SLAM!\*

Geoffrey swung around to see a man in a hoodie bolting towards him. Geoff wasted no time spinning back around and running out of the parking garage and into his work’s front entrance. Everyone in the lobby turned their eyes toward Geoff. He slammed himself into the elevator door, not thinking about taking 20 flights of stairs. Aggressively, he pushed the elevator button out of rhythm. He heard the front lobby doors open behind him. He zipped around.

Nobody. He didn’t spot anybody with a hood over their head. Nor, more importantly, did he see someone rushing towards him. The only thing he noticed were the staring office workers from other departments. Geoff felt something touch his shoulder. He violently flinched.

“Woah, hey man,” the security officer took his hand off Geoff’s shoulder. “I didn’t mean to startle you. You shot through those doors like someone was after you. Is everything okay?”

“Yeah, yeah…” Geoff answered. “I’m sorry about that. No, nothings going on. I just forgot I had an important project due in an hour, so I rushed to the building. I didn’t mean to startle anyone.”

“Alright,” the security officer hesitantly nodded his head. “Just wanted to make sure…” The security officer kept a concerned look on Geoff as he entered the elevator.

As soon as the elevator doors opened back up, Geoff rushed to the bathroom. Vomiting, he decided to stay for a minute to catch his breath again.

An hour had passed by before Geoff left the bathroom. “What the hell was that? Why didn’t I report it?” He didn’t want to think anything else about the situation. He just wanted to get the day over with and head back home. “I should be fine. I’m in the office building now anyway.” He composed himself and went towards his company’s office. Feeling a little more confident about his situation, he headed to go grab a cup of coffee.

“Hey, there’s the lucky man. Good to see you again.” Randy greeted him but got a better look at him, “Good God man, you look like you’ve been hit by a truck!”

“Hey Randy, good to see you too.” Geoff let out a sigh.

“Geez, what’s up with you? You didn’t look that bad earlier. That work project getting to your nerves a little?” Randy asked.

“Yeah, you could say that. Don’t tell anyone this, but some crazy guy started chasing me through the parking garage this morning.” Geoff finished pouring his coffee.

“Really?” Randy was confused, “Are you okay? Maybe you did get hit by a truck.”

“Yeah, more like chased by a truck,” Geoff gave a chuckle sigh.

“Geez, brother! I wish you would have told me about this sooner! I would have had your back. You knew, I was here pretty early.”

“Yeah, I know. I saw your car before getting chased.” Geoff’s ears started to catch onto Randy.

“Well, get some coffee in you. I remember that you’re taking a half day today. Getting off two hours before work? Maybe if you have enough caffeine, you can finish up and get out earlier.”

“Uhh, Randy. How did you know I was getting off two hours before work?”

“What do you mean? You called me pretty early this morning. We talked about your work schedule today.”

“Randy, I didn’t call you this morning.” Geoff’s confusion came out through his voice.

“Did you go out to the bar without me yesterday? I thought you weren’t going out this week? You seem like you can’t remember *clearly* talking to me this morning. I would keep drinking more coffee if I were you. Maybe that’ll jog your memory some.”

“That doesn’t make any sense, Randy!” Geoff confusedly exclaimed.

“So what, you’re not gonna take off early tonight to begin your anniversary evening?”

“No, I am. I just…” Geoff started going pale.

“Look, man,” Randy began, “If you need anything, I am just a phone call away. Don’t leave me out of the loop. Seriously. Look, I don’t know what’s going on either. Just calm down a little, breathe easy, and get through today so you can go see your wife and enjoy each other’s company.”

Geoff let go of some of the stress he was feeling, “You’re right man. I didn’t realize how worked up I was getting.”

“If I were you, I would try to leave work even earlier than originally planned. You’re a hard worker anyway.” Randy said, hitting his back. “Get home to your family. The sooner, the better.”

With that, Randy turned and left for his cubicle. Geoff followed suit and fell into his seat. Leaning back, he watched the office clock.

\_\_\_\_\_

“Oh, your back home early!” Geoffrey’s wife greeted him and kissed him.

“Baby, I am so thankful to be home right now. How was your day?” Geoffrey’s complexion became one of relief.

“Well, I am very glad to see you again. That’s really making my whole day right now.” Laurel squeezed his arm. “Annnd, your son has been looking forward to finally shooting the twenty-two with you. I think you should finally go see him.” She told him playfully.

“Ah, right! I’ll get dressed and take him out. Then, I will see you right afterward.” Geoffrey’s mood went up a thousand-fold. He went up to the bedroom and changed out of his work clothes. Grabbed the twenty-two from the safe, and went to his son's room.”

“Dad!” Samson shot up from his bed.

“Well, what are you laying around for? Let’s get out there and practice!” Without a second wasted, Samson slid his shoes on and grabbed his coat.

The evening sun only gave light to the crisp air. Geoffrey’s and Samson’s camo coats kept them warm in the gentle breeze. The wind had died down compared to earlier that morning.

“Alright son, you’ll want–”

“To hold the trigger like this. I remember, dad!” Samson finished Geoffrey’s sentence.

“Yeah, that’s right…” Geoffrey slowed down a little and smirked. “Go ahead and aim down range, tuck your shoulder in, and ease your breathing.”

Samson, doing as his father told him, pulled the trigger and looked down range each time he shot. His excitement slowly morphed into disappointment. The realization of his shots veering off of target or barely hitting the edge of the target started to upset him.

“Hey, it’s alright buddy. Becoming a good shot takes practice.” Geoffrey consoled Samson. “Look, your old man isn’t any better.”

Taking the gun, Geoffrey took a couple of shots down range. Though his shots hit the target, his grouping was all over the place. “See, it took me a lot of practice to get to where I’m at now. I think being a little rusty runs in the family.”

“I feel like I won’t ever get better,” Samson rebelled.

“Nonsense! I see a great marksman in you. We just need to sculpt it out of yah.”

“Really?”

“Of course. I think that’s enough practice for the both of us today. How about you and mom go hang out for a little bit. Go get some food or something.”

“You’re not coming with us?” Samson looked at his dad.

“Well, I need my secret agent to distract mom from me. You see, I have a surprise for her tonight and I need my main agent to keep her busy for me. Can I count on you?”

Samson’s smile ran wild with imagination, “You can count on me, sir!” He exclaimed gleefully.

“Agent, complete the mission at all costs!” Geoffrey told him.

As the two entered the house, Geoffrey noticed some roses in a vase on the kitchen counter. He looked at them:

*To: Laurel. From: Geoffrey. “Something special for a special someone.”* It read.

Geoffrey’s concern began to swell up within him once again. He didn’t remember ordering any flowers for his wife.

“Hey, baby.” 

“Yeah?” Laurel answered from down the hall.

“When did you get these?” Geoffrey asked as if he knew nothing and played it off.

Walking toward the kitchen she answered, “What do you mean?” She smiled at him, “The flowers that you gave me yourself? Don’t tell me you don’t remember *just* giving me those!” She giggled at him.

Geoffrey’s stomach dropped. Time stood still for him as his adrenaline pumped ever faster through his blood. His mouth laid agape.

“What’s wrong, hun?” Laurel became concerned.

Geoffrey snapped out of the trance, “Uhh, nothing, baby!” He gave a false grin. “I was just zoning out, really trying to remember the moment I came in today.”

“Yeahhhh, you came in for lunch and ate with your son and I…”

Geoffrey’s blood ran cold: Cold enough that it began to boil.

“Mom, can we go get some food? I’m staaarving.” Samson interjected in on the conversation.

Geoffrey gave a false expression, “Yeah, baby. Why don’t you and the boy go out for a little bit. I was gonna do some chores around the house for you.” He gave a somewhat awkward grin.

Laurel raised her eyebrow and expressed a little confusion, “Uhh, okay… Yeah, we can do that.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure the house is nice and clean for us when you both get back.” Geoffrey attempted to comfort his wife, which was an attempt to console himself.

Lightening her expression. “Well, it better be,” She remarked sarcastically. “I love you,” she gave him her affection.

Geoffrey shot a quick “I love you too” back as his family left the door. He paced back and forth within his living room as he waited for them to leave the driveway. As soon as he saw them drive off on the empty road, he shot out of his house and got into his car. Geoffrey raced down the road and called Randy.

“Hello?” Randy answered.

“Randy! I need you to meet me as soon as possible!” Geoff demanded.

“What? What’s going on?”

“I don’t know, Randy. But I think someone is trying to invade my personal life.” Geoffrey didn’t show any signs of slowing down.

“Does this have something to do with earlier today? Look, Geoff, your star–”

“Randy, I don’t care what you think, I just need you to meet me.” Geoff’s car flew down the wooded road.

“Okay, okay. I’m sorry. Where do you want me to meet you?”

“Okay, I need you to meet me at–” Geoff’s phone flew out of his hands as another car slammed into his side. His car skidded and flipped off into the trees. Geoffrey was out.

\_\_\_\_\_

Geoffrey awoke to himself being dragged. He could see slow flashing yellow lights through the woods. His head was pounding. He looked around more and saw the pale moonlight barely lighting the night sky. Some stars poked white holes in the sky. Not many though. His confusion simmered down some and noticed a person was dragging him. He couldn’t tell who it was. Geoffrey attempted to move his hands only to find out that they were zip-tied together. His legs were also zip-tied by his ankles. 

His perpetrator stopped and dropped Geoffrey’s legs to the ground with a \*thud.\* He tilted his head back to take a look back at the flashing yellow lights. Stooping down before him, the man began to speak.

“I’ve looked forward to this day” the man said in a familiar sounding voice. Had Geoffrey heard this voice before? “I’ve waited a long while before I could get to this moment, but I’m glad that my labors could come to fruition.” That accent sounds so familiar. Too familiar… Geoffrey looked up at the perpetrator in hopes of seeing his face.

The flashing yellow light hardly illuminated his face in the pale moonlight, but their was no mistake… Geoffrey saw himself stooping down over him. “I’m sure you’ll forgive me for wanting something I’ve never had,” the man stands up. 

Geoffrey heard the cocking of a gun. At that sound, Geoffrey froze and could only stare deadpanned at the barrel pointed at him. The man pulled the trigger.

\_\_\_\_\_

“Oh my God! Geoffrey!” Randy screamed. “Come on Geoffrey, for the love of God don’t die on me!”

Geoffrey’s eyes twitched from the sound of Randy’s voice. It sounded muffled.

“Oh, thank you, God! Geoffrey, look at me!”

Geoffrey’s eyes fluttered. “Ugh” He groaned, “Randol?”

“Yeah, it’s me buddy. Can you sit up?” Randy looked down, “Holy mother, zip-ties? Buddy, what kind of mess did you get into? Here, let me cut those off of you.” Randy pulled his pocket knife out and cut Geoffrey loose.

Geoffrey felt a warm liquid running down the side of his head. He placed his hand and followed the trail. Randy noticed.

“What the hell? Someone dragged you out here to cut your ear off and leave you to bleed out?”

“Randy,” Geoffrey began coming out of his daze, “how did you find me?”

“I tracked your phone, buddy.” Randy stood Geoffrey up and began helping him to his car. “I heard a loud bang whenever you were telling me where to go. I screamed for your name and didn’t hear anything from you. I did whatever I could to find you and saw that you had phone tracking on. I headed straight over right away. Whoever did this to you didn’t find taking your phone very important!”

“Randy,” Geoffrey started as he sat in Randy’s car, “my family, we got to get to my house. I think something terrible is happening.”

Randy didn't think twice; he started up the car and zipped his way to Geoff's house.

“Where’s your gun?” Geoffrey asked, Randy was flying down the road.

“It’s in the glovebox. What the hell is going on Geoffrey?”

“God, I hope nothing.”

Randy pulled into the driveway, right behind Geoffrey’s vehicle. Randy was dumbfounded. ""How-""

Geoffrey didn’t listen, he got out of the car as soon as it parked. He walked up the walkway. Looking through the window, he could see himself snuggled up next to his wife watching the television. 

His blood boiled cold again.

He slammed through the front door. His wife was screaming. Without hesitation, he ran as close as he could to himself and pulled the gun. He watched himself stand up in confusion. Before Geoffrey could see himself do anything he fired into his chest five times. He watched as his body slumped onto the couch gurgling on his own blood.

“HOLY HELL!” Randy, screamed running in through the front door, looking at the sight. Geoffrey's wife was screaming, covered in Geoffrey's blood.

“Figure out how to aim next time.” Geoffrey spit on his body.

  
***End Note:*** Hi again, I hope you enjoyed the story! Some shitty ending, huh? I could never figure out how to end this story in the short amount of time I wrote it. I wrote this when some friends and I got together and pulled a theme from a hat (I pulled clone). We all got together to read these stories to each other at the end of our break. Some of them had WAY better stories than I did. However, it was a good time all around. Thank you for reading! Here's a bonus micro-fiction I wrote after this story. Read at you own leisure.



**High School Regrets**

Cogs with a piece of wood stuck in between the two of them means neither of them can move. Harry felt like that as he attempted to approach Maribeth. He stayed in his tracks. Nothing could get the gears turning. His joints, no matter how much he desired, would not move. So he stood there in the cafeteria stupified. His friends noticed.

“Dude!” one said in a loud whisper, “just go over there!”

“Yeah man,” another one began, “she’s not even looking this way. She won’t know what happened!”

Maribeth faced her friends on the other side of the cafeteria hall. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, talking about whatever they were talking about. Two things stood out in the cafeteria crowd. One, she wore cat ears. Not another soul wore anything like that in the entirety of their senior year class, let alone on their head and in public. Second, she rested her weight on some crutches. Those were pretty normal; she wore a boot on her foot. Something about her getting in a car wreck? And as she stood there, talking to her friends, Harry’s friends pressed him on.

They dislodged the piece of wood within the cogs. They shoved Harry forward and snickered. He looked back at his friends with a slight smirk. He felt somewhat ready to go through with it. Each step he took felt like an eternity. He drew closer, and somehow knew there was no going back, a tray of food in his hand.

Harry came up from behind with a tray of food and pretended to trip. As he did so, he threw the food up and onto her. Her back and hair covered in milk, spaghetti, and pizza. Fumbling forward, Harry kicked her crutch out from underneath her. She immediately lost her balance and fell forward. She couldn’t catch herself as her face went straight into the tile. A smack and a crack reverbed off the nearest wall of the cafeteria.

Harry pretended to gain his footing and turned around, “Oh damn, my fault.” Once he looked at Maribeth, his eyes shifted away from a smile. Maribeth looked up at him with tears flowing down her cheeks. The blood flowed parallel with the tears, never crossing streams but lightly touching together. Her nose crinkled slightly further inward and to the side from its original position. Her hair disheveled and her cat ears pointing outward from her forehead. Harry could have sworn he saw her glasses shattered.

He looked up from her and to the guys on the other side of the cafeteria. Some of them were laughing while some others bit their knuckles and cussed under their breaths.

“Hey!” One of the teachers yelled out. “What the hell is going on over here?”

“Oh my…” the second teacher saw Maribeth, rushing to help her.

The first teacher immediately knew what happened. He immediately turned to Harry, “You! With me.” Harry went with him. He looked back before leaving the cafeteria, “maybe that wasn’t the best decision…” He thought to himself.

I am not the quilter in the family. That is my wife Stacey. I just watch her turn piles of fabric into beautiful things while I drink coffee and pretend to “help.”

She just started her own subreddit to share tutorials, free patterns, and sewing projects she films for YouTube. The projects have been really popular and she makes them easy enough that even I could probably sew one.

Here are some of her biggest hits: 
•	Fabric Pumpkins 
•	Bowl cozies 
•	Zipper pouches

1mlezpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mlezpw/red_light_district_the_investigation/,Red Light District: The Investigation,"Marcus needed coffee and information, preferably in that order. Agent Rivera had texted him at five in the morning about meeting at Delaney's, a diner off Route 9 that served breakfast twenty-four hours a day because the owner had insomnia and figured everyone else should suffer with him.

The place looked like it had been decorated in 1953 and nobody had bothered to update it since. Red vinyl booths with tears covered in duct tape, a jukebox that only played songs nobody remembered, and fluorescent lights that hummed like they were trying to tell you something.

Rivera sat in the back corner, the cop booth where you could see both exits and keep your back to the wall. He looked like shit. Three days of stubble, clothes that had given up on being professional, and the kind of exhaustion that coffee couldn't touch.

""Cross,"" he said when Marcus slid into the opposite booth. ""You look like hell.""

""You look worse.""

""Yeah, well, some of us still pretend to have day jobs."" Rivera flagged the waitress, who brought coffee without being asked. The pot was already half empty even though Marcus was the only other customer.

""Heard you took the Verne case,"" Rivera said.

""News travels.""

""In this city? News doesn't travel. It fucking teleports."" Rivera pulled a manila folder from under his coat, the kind of file that should have been locked in evidence. ""You want to know about missing grandmothers? I got missing grandmothers.""

He spread photos across the table. Old black and whites, some Polaroids from the seventies, digital prints from the last decade. All different women, all elderly, all with that same lost look that Scarlett's grandmother had in her photos.

""Seven cases,"" Rivera said. ""Going back seventy years. Want to know the fun part?""

""Do I?""

""Every single one was investigated by a private dick. Every single one of those private dicks ended up running some kind of facility within five years. Orphanages, halfway houses, old folks homes."" Rivera pulled out another set of photos. Men mostly, a few women, all with that particular brand of tired that came from seeing too much. ""Look familiar?""

Marcus studied the photos. Different faces, different decades, but something about them made his skin crawl. The way they held themselves, maybe. Or the way they all seemed to be looking at something just outside the frame.

""Here's where it gets really fucked,"" Rivera continued. He pulled out a list of PI licenses. ""Sequential numbers, all counting backward. This guy,"" he tapped a photo from the thirties, ""was number 492. This one from the fifties, 478. This one from the eighties, 461.""

Rivera looked at Marcus. ""You know what your license number is?""

Marcus knew. Had it memorized like every PI did. ""447.""

""Four forty-seven. Counting down from something. Or to something."" Rivera laughed, but there was no humor in it. ""You know what really gets me? I've been a cop for fifteen years, and I can't remember which department I work for. Isn't that fucked? I got a badge, got a gun, got cases, but ask me who signs my checks and I draw a blank.""

The waitress refilled their cups. Rivera paid with a handful of coins that Marcus noticed were all from 1953, but the waitress didn't seem to care. Money was money, even when it was seventy years old.

""Your name,"" Rivera said suddenly. ""You ever think about your name?""

""It's just a name.""

""Marcus Cross. Marked crossing. That's what it means. And every one of these investigators had names like that. Thomas Gateway. Sarah Bridge. David Porter. All names about passing through, crossing over, carrying across."" Rivera leaned forward. ""They name you for what you're going to do, not who you are.""

""You're paranoid.""

""In this city? Paranoia is just pattern recognition."" Rivera gathered up the photos, but left one on the table. It showed a man from the fifties, standing in an office that looked exactly like Marcus's, down to the water stain on the wall that looked like a map of nowhere.

""That's Harold Travener,"" Rivera said. ""License number 461. Investigated a missing grandmother in 1959. By 1964, he was running Saint Catherine's Home for Wayward Children. You know what happened to those kids?""

""They got adopted?""

""They got gone. Every seven kids, a new batch would come in. No records of where they went. And Harold? He died at exactly seventy years old, on the same date he'd started investigating the grandmother.""

Rivera stood, tossed a twenty on the table even though the coffee was only three bucks. ""I'm telling you this because I like you, Cross. And because I'm tired of watching this same fucking story play out. Get out while you can. Drop the case. Move to another city. Hell, move to another country.""

""Can't. Already took the retainer.""

""Then God help you."" Rivera headed for the door, then stopped. ""You know the really fucked thing? Tomorrow I won't remember having this conversation. That's how it works. We get close to the truth, then we forget. Over and over. The only reason I remember now is because I've been writing everything down, hiding notes from myself like some schizophrenic asshole.""

He left, and Marcus sat with the cold coffee and the photo of Harold Travener. The man in the picture could have been Marcus's grandfather. Or maybe Marcus in thirty years. Or maybe Marcus from thirty years ago. Time didn't seem to matter much when you looked at it too hard.

The waitress came to clear the table. ""Your friend forgot his folder,"" she said.

Marcus looked. Rivera had left the entire file, all the photos, all the documentation. Accident or intention, it didn't matter. Marcus took it and left, stepping out into a morning that felt too bright, too normal for what he'd just learned.

* * *

The city library was a Carnegie building, all stone and ambition from an era when people thought knowledge could save them. It officially had twelve floors, which Marcus knew because he'd been there before, researching normal cases with normal explanations.

But today the elevator had a button for thirteen.

It had always been there, the elevator operator assured him. A young kid, maybe nineteen, wearing a uniform that belonged in a museum. ""Thirteenth floor's always been there. Archive section. You need a special pass.""

Marcus showed him Scarlett's envelope. The operator nodded like it made perfect sense and pushed the button.

The thirteenth floor wasn't supposed to exist, but it did anyway, the way things in this city existed when they needed to. The Archive was a single room that somehow took up the entire floor, filled with card catalogs that nobody had used since the eighties and shelves that went back further than the walls should allow.

The Librarian sat at a desk made of some dark wood that seemed to absorb light. She was ancient or young or somewhere in between, depending on how the light hit her. Her nameplate just said ""Librarian,"" like that was both job and identity.

""Mr. Cross,"" she said before he could speak. ""Here about the Verne case, I assume.""

""How did you...""

""I'm a librarian. We know things."" She smiled, and her teeth were the yellow of old paper. ""Information has a price here. Not money. Money's just paper with promises printed on it. I deal in more honest currency.""

""Which is?""

""Memories. Specifically, memories of when you believed in happy endings."" She pulled out a ledger, its pages thick as cardstock. ""One memory for one truth. Fair trade.""

Marcus thought about walking out. Should have walked out. But he needed to know what Rivera's files meant, needed to understand why seven investigators over seventy years had all disappeared into the same story.

""Fine. What kind of memory?""

""Your first case. The one you solved clean, where the good guys won and the bad guys paid. You must have one of those, from before you learned better.""

Marcus did. The Patterson case, a simple fraud that he'd unraveled in three days. The client had cried with relief. The criminal had confessed. Justice had been served without any blood or complexity. It was the case that made him think he could do this job and sleep at night.

""I'll take that one,"" the Librarian said, and suddenly Marcus couldn't quite remember the details. He knew he'd solved a case called Patterson, knew it had gone well, but the specifics were gone like smoke.

The Librarian pulled out a map of the city, covered it with red string. ""Every place you've lived,"" she said, pushing pins into the map. ""Every office you've rented. Every case you've worked."" The string connected the pins, creating a pattern. ""See it yet?""

Marcus stared at the map. The strings formed a shape. A house. A cottage, specifically, with a peaked roof and a chimney and a door right where his current office sat.

""You've been building it without knowing,"" the Librarian said. ""Every move you make, every case you take, you're drawing the outline of something. And you're almost done. Just a few more pins and the picture will be complete.""

She pulled out another ledger, this one bound in something that might have been leather but felt warmer than it should. ""Every investigator who worked a missing grandmother case signed this. Look.""

The pages were full of signatures. Harold Travener, 1959. Sarah Bridge, 1973. David Porter, 1987. And on and on, forty-six signatures in forty-six different hands. At the bottom of the current page, a forty-seventh signature was forming, the ink appearing letter by letter.

Marcus Cross.

He hadn't signed it. His hand was nowhere near the book. But his name appeared anyway, in his own handwriting.

""Your cases,"" the Librarian continued, pulling out a stack of files Marcus recognized as his own. ""Children and elderly, always in groups of seven. Seven runaway kids you placed in halfway houses. Seven confused elderly you helped into assisted living. Seven, seven, seven. You know what seven means in stories?""

""Completion,"" Marcus said without thinking.

""Completion. And you're almost complete, Mr. Cross. The house is almost drawn. The signature is almost dry. The story is almost over."" She closed the ledger. ""Or almost beginning, depending on how you look at time.""

Marcus backed away from the desk. The map was still there, the red strings forming a cottage made of his life's movements. ""What happens when it's complete?""

""The same thing that always happens. The investigator stops investigating and starts being investigated. The hunter becomes the hunted. The detective becomes the mystery."" She smiled again. ""It's a very old story, Mr. Cross. Older than this city. Older than these buildings. But it needs fresh players every seventy years or so.""

Marcus left without another word. The elevator was waiting, the operator smiling like he knew a secret. ""Going down?""

""Yeah. Down.""

But when the elevator opened, Marcus wasn't in the library lobby. He was on the street, three blocks from where he'd started, and the library behind him only had twelve floors. Had always only had twelve floors, the sign assured him.

* * *

The Velvet Room sat between a dry cleaner and a tax office, the kind of wine bar that looked closed even when it was open. Marcus had heard about it but never been inside. It was the sort of place that required an invitation, and his invitations usually came from bail bondsmen and insurance companies, not whoever ran establishments with velvet in the name.

But the door opened when he touched it, and the woman behind the bar smiled like she'd been expecting him.

""Mr. Cross. Scarlett said you might stop by.""

The woman was beautiful in a way that made you nervous, red hair that caught light that wasn't there, green eyes that seemed to see through things rather than at them. Her name tag said ""V. Vulpine,"" which was either a real name or a joke Marcus didn't get.

""Scarlett Verne's a client of yours?""

""Client, friend, hunting partner. Depends on the day."" Vulpine poured seven glasses without asking what he wanted. Each glass was different, each liquid a different color. ""She pays well for information. So do you, I hear.""

""I pay in cash.""

""Cash is just paper. I prefer stories. Specifically, stories about who you think you are."" She pushed the first glass toward him. ""Drink.""

""I don't drink on the job.""

""You drink bourbon in your office at three in the morning. This is practically health food in comparison.""

Marcus picked up the first glass. It tasted like being seventeen, like cheap beer and believing you were invincible. The second tasted like twenty-five, whiskey and thinking you knew how the world worked. The third was thirty-two, wine at a wedding where you realized everyone was pretending to be happier than they were.

By the fourth glass, Marcus noticed the bar had changed. Or maybe he was seeing it properly for the first time. There weren't just a few patrons. There were dozens, all drinking alone, all looking like they were waiting for something. And they were all watching him without turning their heads.

""Your bar's got a lot of customers for eleven in the morning,"" Marcus said.

""Different customers see different bars. You see a wine bar. The businessman in the corner sees a sports bar. The college kid by the window sees a coffee shop. Everyone sees what they need to see.""

The fifth glass tasted like forty, bourbon and realizing you'd become exactly what you'd sworn you wouldn't. The sixth was forty-five, gin and forgetting why you'd started drinking in the first place.

The seventh glass sat untouched. It was clear, like water, but somehow Marcus knew it would taste like seventy. Like endings. Like beginnings. Like the moment when you stop being one thing and start being another.

""Scarlett's been very patient,"" Vulpine said. ""Seventy years is a long time to wait between hunts.""

""Hunts?""

""Oh, she didn't mention that part? She's quite the hunter, our Scarlett. Runs in the family. Her grandmother was a hunter too. And her grandmother's grandmother. All the way back to the first girl who put on a red hood and went into the woods.""

Vulpine pulled out a photo album, the old kind with plastic sleeves and yellowing pictures. ""Want to see something fun?""

She opened to a page from the fifties. There was Marcus. Not someone who looked like Marcus. Actually Marcus. Same scar on his left hand from when he'd put it through a window at fifteen. Same way of standing with his weight on his right foot. Same everything except the clothes and the photo quality.

""That's Harold Travener,"" Vulpine said. ""Or was. Before he became something else.""

She flipped pages. The seventies. Marcus again, this time as Sarah Bridge. The eighties, David Porter. Every decade, same person, different name, different face but somehow exactly the same.

""Time isn't a line in fairy tales,"" Vulpine said. ""It's a circle. You go around and around, playing different roles in the same story. Sometimes you're the detective. Sometimes you're the grandmother. Sometimes you're the wolf.""

""This is bullshit. Photo manipulation.""

""Is it?"" Vulpine poured herself a drink from a bottle that wasn't on the shelf. ""You've been having dreams, haven't you? About children you've never met. About a house made of something sweet. About someone in red coming to the door.""

Marcus had been having those dreams. Every night for the past month. But he hadn't told anyone, hadn't even written them down.

""Drink the seventh glass,"" Vulpine said. ""Or don't. But either way, you're almost back where you started. The circle's almost complete. Scarlett's almost ready for her hunt.""

Marcus stood to leave. The seventh glass remained on the bar, clear and patient.

""One more thing,"" Vulpine called after him. ""That halfway house you've been running? The one you don't remember starting? You might want to check your records. Count the children. It's always seven, isn't it? Seven come in, seven go out, but never the same seven.""

Marcus left without answering. Outside, the Velvet Room's windows were dark, with a sign that said ""Closed for Renovations Since 1987."" But he could still taste the six drinks on his tongue, six different years of his life, six different versions of himself.

* * *

Officer Sullivan walked the same beat he'd walked since 1953. Down Maple, up Oak, across Third, around the park. Eight hours a day, five days a week, for seventy years. His uniform had changed with the times, but everything else about him remained exactly the same.

Marcus caught up with him at the corner of Oak and Third, where Sullivan always took his lunch break on a bench that had been replaced sixteen times but always looked identical.

""Officer Sullivan?""

Sullivan looked up from his sandwich. Looked at Marcus. Looked through Marcus. Looked at all the versions of Marcus that had stood in this exact spot before.

""You're back,"" Sullivan said. ""Different face this time, but you're back. Number 447, right? They're counting down faster now.""

""We've never met.""

""We've met seven times. You just don't remember the other six."" Sullivan pulled out his notepad, the kind cops hadn't used in twenty years. ""You want to know about the missing grandmother. You always want to know about the missing grandmother.""

He showed Marcus the notepad. The same incident report, written over and over, forty-seven times. Each in different handwriting, but all describing the same thing: elderly woman missing from care facility, family member in red files report, private investigator begins search.

""I write it down every time,"" Sullivan said. ""Every time you come, every time you ask, every time you don't remember asking before. Forty-seven times so far. You're always so sure you're different. So sure you'll solve it. So sure you won't become her.""

""Become who?""

""The grandmother. The one you're looking for. She was an investigator too, about seventy years ago. Number 461. Harold Travener, he called himself then. Investigated a missing grandmother, found her, killed her, became her. That's how the story goes.""

Sullivan flipped through his notepad. Every page was the same report, over and over. ""I've been walking this beat since 1953. Same route every day. You know why? Because I saw something I shouldn't have back then. Saw the story behind the story. And now I'm stuck in it, walking the same streets, watching the same tale play out every seventy years.""

""This is insane.""

""Is it? Check your halfway house records. Check how many children have gone through there in the past five years. Check where they went."" Sullivan stood, his lunch break over even though he'd barely touched his sandwich. ""You think you're investigating a missing person. But you're not. You're experiencing time backwards. The grandmother you're looking for? You've already killed her. You just haven't done it yet.""

He started walking his beat again, same route he'd walked for seventy years. ""I'll see you again in seventy years,"" he called back. ""Different face, same questions. I'll have the same answers. You won't like them any better then.""

Marcus watched him go, this cop who'd been walking the same beat since before Marcus was born. Or since after Marcus died. Time didn't seem to follow rules anymore.

* * *

Marcus's office was on the third floor of a building that should have been condemned in the eighties. He'd been renting it for five years, or maybe seventy, or maybe he'd just started yesterday. Time kept slipping around like a drunk trying to find his keys.

The bourbon in his desk drawer was wrong. The label said ""Old Surrender, Distilled 1953, Bottled Never."" That wasn't a real brand. Couldn't be a real brand. But it tasted real enough, burned real enough going down.

His chair fit him perfectly, molded to his body like he'd been sitting in it for decades. Which was impossible because he'd bought it secondhand last year. Or thought he had. The receipt in his files was dated 1953, but that was obviously a typo.

The case files in his cabinet went back further than they should. Cases from the sixties, the seventies, the eighties. All in his handwriting. All involving groups of seven. Seven missing kids who turned up at halfway houses. Seven confused elderly who needed placement in care facilities. Seven, always seven.

In the back of the bottom drawer, behind files he didn't remember filing, was a journal. Leather-bound, or something that looked like leather but felt warmer, more alive. He opened it.

Forty-six different handwriting styles filled the pages, but all saying variations of the same thing:

""I thought I was investigating her. I was becoming her.""

""The grandmother is the detective is the grandmother.""

""Time runs backwards in fairy tales.""

""Seven groups of seven equals completion.""

""She hunts every seventy years.""

""The house is made of bread and children.""

""I am Harold Travener. I am Sarah Bridge. I am David Porter. I am Marcus Cross.""

The last entry was in his own handwriting, dated tomorrow: ""I understand now. The halfway house was never about saving them. It was about collecting them. Seven by seven by seven. The grandmother needs them for the story. I need them for the story. We need them for the story.""

Marcus dropped the journal. His hands were shaking. He poured another bourbon from the impossible bottle, and that's when he noticed the walls.

Under the cracked paint, something else showed through. Gingerbread. Actual gingerbread, mortared with icing, studded with gumdrops. The window frames weren't wood and glass anymore. They were spun sugar, hard candy, the kind that would shatter if you put your fist through it but would cut you just as deep as real glass.

The phone rang.

Marcus stared at it. It was a rotary phone, the kind nobody used anymore. He didn't own a rotary phone. Had never owned one. But there it sat on his desk, ringing with a sound like children laughing.

He answered.

""Hello, Mr. Cross?"" The voice was young, scared. ""This is Janet Morrison. You helped place my son Tommy in that halfway house last year? I'm worried. He was supposed to call every week, but it's been three months and the house says they have no record of him.""

Marcus pulled out his files on the Morrison case. Tommy Morrison, age fifteen, runaway, placed at Sunnyside Halfway House. His own halfway house, though he couldn't remember when he'd started running it. The file said Tommy had been placed successfully, but there were no follow-up notes.

""I'll look into it, Mrs. Morrison.""

""There were six other boys who went in with Tommy. Their families are worried too. That makes seven total. Seven boys who just vanished.""

Seven. Always seven.

Marcus hung up and pulled out all his halfway house files. Five years of placements. Seven kids at a time. Forty-nine children total. Seven groups of seven.

None of them had follow-up notes. None of them had exit records. They went in, and then... nothing.

The walls were more gingerbread now than paint. The bourbon bottle was made of candy glass. His desk was compressed graham crackers. The office was becoming something else, had always been becoming something else, would always have been becoming something else.

Marcus called Sunnyside Halfway House. His own voice answered.

""Sunnyside, how can I help you?""

""This is Marcus Cross. I'm calling about Tommy Morrison.""

""Never heard of him,"" his own voice said. ""Must have the wrong number.""

""I placed him there myself.""

""Did you? Are you sure? Memory's a funny thing in this business. Kids come and go. Or maybe they never come at all. Maybe they're already gone before they arrive.""

The line went dead.

Marcus stood, and his chair held his shape like a memory. The office door had changed too. Still wood on one side, but on the other side, the side that faced the hallway, it was something else. Cookie. A giant cookie, decorated with icing to look like wood.

He opened the door. The hallway beyond was normal. Completely normal. Fluorescent lights, water-stained ceiling, threadbare carpet. But when he looked back, his office wasn't there anymore. Just a wall. Just a normal wall where his office had always never been.

His phone rang. The phone in the office that wasn't there anymore.

He could hear it through the wall that had replaced his door. Could hear his own voice answering it. Could hear himself saying, ""Sunnyside Halfway House. Yes, we have room for seven more. We always have room for seven more.""

Marcus ran. Down the stairs that had too many or too few steps depending on how you counted. Out onto the street where it was simultaneously noon and midnight and three in the morning. To his car, which was exactly where he'd parked it and also had never existed.

He drove to Sunnyside Halfway House, the one he apparently ran, the one he didn't remember starting. It was on Maple Street, right next to Serenity Estates. Had always been there. Had never been there. Was there now.

The building was a house. A cottage, specifically. With a peaked roof and a chimney and a door that looked like wood but smelled like gingerbread.

Marcus had his keys. Had always had them. Would always have had them.

Inside, the house was empty. Seven beds in seven rooms, all perfectly made, all waiting. On the kitchen table was a ledger. His ledger. Showing forty-nine children received, zero children discharged.

But there was another column. One he hadn't noticed before. ""Transferred to S.E.""

Serenity Estates.

They hadn't vanished. They'd been moved next door. Seven at a time. From his halfway house to the assisted living facility. Children becoming elderly without the middle part. Without the living part.

The front door opened. Scarlett Verne stood there in her burgundy coat, but now Marcus could see what he'd been trained not to see. The coat wasn't burgundy. It was red. Red like blood, like apples, like the stories everyone knows but nobody believes.

""Hello, Grandmother,"" she said. ""I've been looking for you.""

Marcus looked down at his hands. They were older than they'd been this morning. Or younger. Or exactly the same age they'd always been, which was every age at once.

""I'm not the grandmother. I'm investigating the grandmother.""

""You're investigating yourself, Marcus. You've always been investigating yourself. That's what makes it such a good story.""

She stepped into the house that was his office that was a cottage made of candy and children's dreams and investigator's nightmares.

""Forty-nine children,"" she said. ""Seven groups of seven. One more group and you're complete. One more seven and the story starts over.""

Marcus wanted to run, but his feet knew this floor. Had walked it for five years. For seventy years. Forever.

""The real joke,"" Scarlett said, pulling something from her coat, ""is that you hired me. Seventy years ago, you hired me to find yourself. And I always do. Every seventy years, I find you right here, in this house, with this ledger, with these numbers.""

What she pulled from her coat was an axe. But also it was a checkbook. But also it was nothing at all.

""Time to complete the cycle, Grandmother. Time to finish the story so it can start again.""

Marcus ran. Out the back door, through a yard that was sometimes a parking lot and sometimes a forest and sometimes nothing at all. Behind him, Scarlett laughed, and her laughter sounded like wolves howling, like children singing, like investigators screaming when they realize what they've been investigating all along.

He ran toward his office, but his office was in the cottage. He ran toward his car, but his car was also the cottage. Everything was the cottage. Everything had always been the cottage.

And in the distance, getting closer or further depending on how time felt about it, Scarlett Verne hunted him through a story that had been told forty-seven times before and would be told again, once Marcus stopped being Marcus and started being what he'd always been becoming.

The grandmother.

The investigator.

MACUSA Case File #DE-007

Subject: Verosika Mayday

Species: Succubus Demon (Lust Ring native, Hell)

Status: Extra-Planar Entity — Non-extraditable; restricted Earth access via Summoning Contracts & Soul Bargains

Primary Realm of Origin: The Pride Ring, Hell

Occupation: Pop Idol (Hell’s music industry) & Contract Seductress


****

Background:

Verosika Mayday is one of Hell’s most infamous succubi, renowned both for her chart-topping music career in the Pride Ring and her specialty in contract-bound seduction and soul acquisition. While primarily active in Hell’s entertainment industry, she frequently crosses over to Earth for “private gigs” involving high-profile No-Maj and magical targets.

Her Earthside appearances are often tied to summoning pacts with wealthy mortals, many of whom are unaware that her services double as recruitment into demonic servitude.

MACUSA first flagged Verosika after an illegal Earthside concert in Los Angeles caused a surge in magical activity, drawing dozens of enchanted and possessed No-Majs into her entourage.


****

 Criminal Record (Earthside):

Mass enchantment of No-Majs via song-based glamour spells.

Theft of enchanted artifacts during a 2018 Manhattan visit, including a cursed mirror from the Salem Witch Museum vaults.

Attempted soul-binding of a junior Auror during an undercover operation (Auror survived, but required three months of magical detox).

Seems to have Personal grudge with Hellborn assassination agencies, but with notably I.M.P., included in at least one confirmed joint operation with Blitzo. (Miami Beach Florida) 



****

 Personality Profile:

Traits: Seductive, manipulative, quick-witted, spite-driven—particularly toward ex-lovers.

Strengths:

Mastery of charm-based magic, both vocal and tactile.

Strong illusion and shapeshifting abilities (can pass for human effortlessly).

Immense stage presence that doubles as a magical lure.

****

Weaknesses:

Tends to underestimate opponents once she’s emotionally invested.

Prone to holding grudges, which can be exploited to bait her.




****

 MACUSA Notes on Threat Level:

While not as openly violent as certain other Hellborn operatives, Verosika is considered Class B: Societal Infiltrator—dangerous due to her subtlety, popularity, and ability to bypass magical defenses through emotional manipulation rather than brute force.
Containment attempts are complicated by her fanbase, which often shields her movements on Earth.


****

 Special Advisory to Aurors & Hit Wizards:

Never meet with Verosika alone, even under glamour-resistant wards—her magic works on a psychic-empathic level, bypassing standard enchantment protections.

Avoid direct verbal negotiation; she often hides binding clauses in casual conversation.

If located Earthside, call in a Demonic Cultural Liaison to handle containment and avoid PR disasters, as she is notorious for leaking compromising images of MACUSA operatives.

MACUSA Internal Culture File – “The Verosika Wall”

Location: Auror Headquarters, Sub-Basement 3, Break Room Corridor

Established: April 2022

Purpose: Morale hazard / cautionary reminder


****

Overview:

After the Miami Beach Incident (Ref: FL-231), a tradition began within the Auror Office — those who take on assignments involving Verosika Mayday and survive are immortalized on the so-called Wall of Shame.

The wall isn’t an official MACUSA record, but no one dares take it down. It serves two functions:

1. Warning rookies about the “succubus problem.”


2. Entertaining veterans who’ve already made their peace with the fact that MACUSA can’t seem to catch her.




****

What’s on the Wall:

A row of framed photos — each one showing a completely exhausted Auror the morning after their encounter with Verosika.

Every subject appears sweaty, disheveled, and dehydrated, often still in rumpled clothes from the night before.

Most are holding coffee or hydration potions, staring into the camera with the dead-eyed expression of someone who’s just been reminded they have paperwork to file.

Caption cards beneath each photo feature the Auror’s name, the date of their mission, and one sarcastic quote overheard during debrief (examples: “It’s not what it looked like.”, “I swear she glamoured the champagne.”, “...Was there a goat?”).



****

Initiation Tradition:

When a new photo goes up, the entire Auror shift gathers to:

1. Place a plastic lei around the frame (a leftover from Miami Beach).


2. Make the “inductee” retell the story while their colleagues pretend not to enjoy it.


3. Present them with a Coffee Mug with “I Survived Verosika”.




****

MACUSA Official Position:

Publicly, the Wall doesn’t exist.
Privately, senior staff admit it works better than most briefings at reminding Aurors that seductive demons don’t play fair.


*****


Special Profile – Auror James “Jimmy” Carrow

Status: Permanent Desk Duty
Wall of Shame Appearances: 26 (unbroken record)
First Encounter: Miami Beach Incident (FL-231)
Last Encounter: “The Wand Incident” (NY-445-B)


****

Background:

Jimmy was once a promising young field Auror with a talent for rapid response work and a dangerous lack of self-preservation when it came to succubi-related missions.
After his first run-in with Verosika Mayday, most Aurors avoided her like a cursed Firewhisky bottle. Jimmy, however, seemed to volunteer. Every. Single. Time.


****

Highlights of Jimmy’s Verosika File:

1. Photos #1–5: Mostly standard post-Verosika condition — sweaty, dazed, dehydrated.


2. Photo #7: Wearing nothing but a MACUSA-issued tie. Refused to explain.


3. Photo #12: Entire debrief was him humming one of her songs while sipping a Gillywater.


4. Photo #18: Confetti stuck in his hair and smelling of tequila.


5. Photo #23: Sporting a love bite in the shape of a MACUSA crest.


6. Photo #26 (The Wand Incident): Following an altercation where Verosika reportedly shoved Jimmy’s wand somewhere deeply undignified, he was put on permanent desk duty “for his own safety.”




****

Current Duties:

Sorting and cataloguing confiscated Dark Artifacts.

Reviewing paperwork from other people’s Verosika encounters.

Occasionally giving rookies cautionary lectures that sound suspiciously like sales pitches.



****

Quote from Senior Auror M. Dawlish:

“We didn’t retire Jimmy. We just… grounded him. For the safety of the mission. And for the dignity of the office.”

*No velvet heat for the cream.*

*that once lined the edge of spring,*

*each one a deep breath*

*you never got to finish yet.*

*You wear something*

*stitched from remembering-*

*a layer of softness*

*the wind still can’t quite touch.*

*Warm, comforting,*

*as much for you-*

*as for it.*

*-*

*This is not love.*

*But something leans near it-*

*a scent you almost name,*

*a sweetness sharp enough to feel*

*just under the sternum.*

*-*

*The bitterness lifts*

*as the first sip finds*

*It's a long way home.*

*And you,*

**Preparation Method and Convenience:** The preparation method is straightforward: simply add water (if required), microwave for the specified time, and fluff with a fork. The convenience extends beyond the ease of cooking to include minimal cleanup, as the rice is cooked directly in the cup, eliminating the need for pots and pans.

1mlefld,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1mlefld/persistent_side_effects/,Persistent side effects,"Hi I’m new to this group but have been on Wegovy for almost 5 months now and recently just increased to 2.4mg. I started this medication since I have PCOS and have been stubbornly heavy my whole life despite being a very active person. My side effects have been borderline unmanageable and taking this shot each week is beginning to feel like an act of self harm. I’m tired, weak, and always feeling sick, but the freedom from food noise and seeing the weight peel off has been motivating me to keep going. 

I’ve increased each month per my doctor’s recommendations but have had pretty rough unwavering side effects since the beginning. I’m 2 weeks into the 2.4mg  and thought the side effects would be improving by now, but this week has been absolutely awful. From painful constipation, vomiting almost every night and nausea/diarrhea throughout the day, I’m maybe absorbing 500 cals maximum a day regularly. I’ve lost 30lbs since I started which is maybe a little too much too quickly (I started at 195, currently 165). 

I am worried if I can’t get these side effects under control or can’t increase my food intake, I’ll have to discontinue the medication and won’t meet my weight loss goals. I’m at the highest dose with plans to maintain this regimen until advised by my doctor to stop/taper down. Did I increase too quickly? I wasn’t aware that people were allowed to go up slower… Is there chances of these side effects improving now that I’m staying on the 2.4mg? Is anyone else feeling like sh** taking this medication? Does anyone have advice for maintaining muscle/getting in protein despite these side effects?

""So, more space, isolated areas and this equipment,"" the colonel said, making a quick note and adding it to a large board with hundreds of other notes and documents. ""Anything else?""

""And..."" I hesitated to speak, as at the back of the tent, the leader Skalth was present, watching with fascination what looked like a documentary of some human historical event, completely absorbed in the narration as he devoured the eleventh can of rations. He seemed to enjoy the suffering and adversity of the humans in the video. Covered in rubble, surrounded by destruction and fallen comrades, their gaze remained fixed on the horizon, never losing the grip on their weapon. Hunger, wounds, fear… nothing seemed to compare to the hatred for their enemies.

If that's what they can feel towards their own people, I´m terrified to discover what they might feel towards other species.

""Hehe... Fascinating..."" Skalth said as one of his claws scraped the bottom of a can to get out every last bit of rations before opening the next one.

...

""Were you going to say something else?"" The colonel brought me out of my thoughts. His eyes could barely stay open, and his voice told me he was exhausted too. For some reason he seemed to be more patient with me than with the other staff, otherwise he would yell at me to stop wasting his time.

""... The Zurilian medics also expressed their concerns about apparent Arxurs lurking outside the medical tent,"" I said, still fearful of their leader's reaction.

...

""Do you have something to say, Skalth?"" The colonel pressed his brow in annoyance, waiting for a response.

""I wouldn't worry,"" the Arxur said with complete indifference. ""Even in the crisis you're in now, my people are better fed than usual."" He licked a claw arrogantly.

...

I suppose he thought that was a sufficient answer, but neither the colonel nor I saw it that way.

""All the food we're consuming in this place is rations given to us by your people. It's not as fun as screaming prey, but it gets the job done. There's no need to hunt anything while we're here."" Skalth stood up and walked toward us, leaving the documentary filled with explosions and gunfire in the background. ""My men know how to obey orders and if one of them comes back smelling of blood, they know exactly what awaits them."" The Gray´s snot lowered to my level. ""Is that enough guarantee for you? Little prey.""

I hadn't felt this scared since the day the Greys arrived, but even compared to that day, the Hunter Skalth's stare was even more terrifying than all his subordinates combined.

""I'm j-just delivering the message..."" I swallowed hard to keep from vomiting because of the predator's nauseating breath and my claws made their way to the weapon at my waist, a response that had become almost instinctive these past days, though I might not be able to do much against such a monster. ""I-I'm not afraid of you."" Showing weakness in front of them could be a death sentence at any moment.

...

""Interesting... YOU'RE ALL VERY INTERESTING!"" Skalth exclaimed with a roar before returning to his projector to feast on more death and destruction while licking the bottom of the ration can. ""Now I understand why Chief Hunted Isif has such an interest in all of you...""

…

“I'll give my men a reminder later if that will stop you from interrupting me again,” He said, seeing we still weren´t convinced. 

""Sigh... Part of their mission is to learn about our culture and history, but I think I made a mistake by giving him access to the History Channel..."" The colonel at my side said. ""In any case, as soon as possible I'll request that security be reinforced around the medical tent. I'm not sure fear of  their superior officer will be enough to stop some of them.""

That statement only made my worries worse.

""... By the way, how's your team?"" The colonel forced a smile as if what he said had never happened.

""...Alice is with the rescue teams, they are exploring the bunkers, Alan is on communications and Alexander is trying to repair the ship,"" I said.

""And Martin?""

""He's still in the medical tent but he looks much better now.""

""Make sure he doesn't get out of there,"" The colonel laughed. ""I don't have time for any more trouble.""

""Yeah, I know what you mean…” Part of my duties include going to the medical tent every day to prevent the captain from escaping and killing the first Arxur he sees… After being rescued, the first thing the captain did upon arriving back at the base was try to shoot the first Arxur he saw. Skalth took it with great humor and interest, but the implications of such a thing happening could be catastrophic.

""I´m on it , I'll let you know if anything changes,"" I said.

""Keep up the good work. You're my eyes on this base,"" The colonel saluted, which I returned in kind, feeling somewhat refreshed.

""YES SIR!"" I said with determination before leaving the colonel's tent.

His words didn't make my job any easier and they definitely didn't make my tiredness lessen even a little, but they made me feel like my efforts were worth something. Besides, that was my last big task today, which meant...

Training with Alan!

I'd been waiting for this all day, for a moment I thought I wouldn't finish in time. My gun was ready, loaded and oiled just like he'd taught me, just a couple more errands on the way to Alan's and...

""I'm sorry, Kajim."" That was the first thing Alan said as soon as he saw me walk in, practically without taking his eyes off the monitor he was working on.

""What? But you promised...""

""Sigh..."" Alan rubbed his eyes and invited me closer to his monitor. ""Look at this..."" he said.

On the screen, a group of soldiers were removing debris while another group of men forced open a huge door with heavy machinery.

""That's footage from Alice's body camera. Another shelter managed to hold out..."" The relief in Alan's voice was noticeable.

As soon as the door opened wide enough, dozens of people rushed out, greeted by aid staff and a couple of Zurulians who dared to go and help.

""The bunker before this one didn't hold up..."" Alan said, ""But at least there are more survivors than we expected.""

""That's good, right."" I said.

""Yes... But now we have to find a place for them. This farm barely has what it takes to be considered a base and is almost at full capacity. Logistics are hell,"" Alan took a sip of cold coffee on his table. ""Today I won't be able to keep my promise... I'm sorry.""

...

""It's… Okay..."" It wasn't okay, all day I endured just for this moment and... Well, I can't blame him, if this means more humans survived then it's okay.

""I'll make it up to you as soon as this blows over,you have my word."" With a gentle touch, he patted my head.

...

""Why don't you ask Alexander, maybe he can help...""

""Don't count me in buddy."" The voice of our ship's engineer echoed from the back of the tent. Sitting in the darkness, all that was visible was the glow of his screen reflected on his glasses.

Neither of us had noticed his presence.

""Aren't you supposed to be repairing the ship?"" Alan said, annoyed at the thought of him wasting his time.

""The VEN-17's flight days have come to an end,"" Alexander said without looking up. ""The damage was excessive. The sensors are burned out, various mechanisms are melted and I think one of the evacuees defecated in a corner of the cargo hold.""

Neither Alan nor I said a single word. The time I spent on that ship was short but it was the first time I had boarded one. Saying goodbye wasn't easy.

""What's still useful will go as spare parts for other ships; the rest will probably be melted down and reused.""

""So... How will we get back to our deliveries?"" I said.

""Sigh... One problem at a time, buddy..."" Alexander continued working on his computer. ""I'm trying to recover the navigation data for future flights and... I'm trying to recover the recordings from our last flight. The internet will love it.""

I wasn't sure what he meant, but it sounded important. It was best to let them work, even if it meant not getting a training day and… no more ship.

Maybe I could do it on my own and... No, I don't think Alan would approve.

""I promise we'll go practice another time..."" Alan said.

“And as soon as I can I will design a proper grip for your gun, I might even put some flames on it or something,” Alexander said.

…

""I'll go see if someone needs my help over there..."" I said, leaving the tent.

""See you at dinner?"" Alan asked. ""I'll give you my dessert.""

""Me too!"" Alexander added.

""...S-Sure..."" I said with a mask of a smile on my face.

...

...

First, Alan said he couldn't train with me, then, Alexander said we no longer had a ship to travel together. This day couldn't have gotten any worse...

""Thank you, thank you, and remember: HUMANITY FIRST!"" I went out to the center of the base and the first thing I heard was the senator and the end of his last speech with the same stupid phrase that had become the motto of many other humans with the same ideology on the internet. His people began handing out leaflets to those still watching, probably more anti-federation propaganda or something else. I really had no interest in finding out.

I just hope he gets this over with soon and goes off to be a nuisance somewhere else.

…

I decided to move away from the middle of the base a little; the orchards at the back of the place seemed like a tempting place to take a well-deserved rest, otherwise, someone would probably ask me for a favor if they saw me doing nothing.

I sat under the foliage of one of the first trees, not too far away but far enough away to not be noticed unless someone looked twice in my direction.

...

I'll just take a moment... I don't feel ok if everyone else around me is still working but me, but I really need this.

...

I lay down on the soft ground and felt some of my quills dig in a little; no big deal since I needed a bath anyway. The sky was beginning to turn pastel and the first stars were just becoming visible. This wouldn't last long as the bright lamps at the base would soon drown out the faint glow of the celestial bodies.

""Hmmm?""

Among the tree's foliage, small fruits made their way into this world, growing indifferently to everything around them. All of them were different sizes and in shades ranging from green to a brilliant red. You didn't need to be an expert to know that this color indicates that it's ready to be devoured.

...

I feel like I've seen this fruit before, with a juicy, crunchy white core but, I wasn't sure. Well, that didn't matter; If humans grew these trees for food, then I'm sure it must be delicious.

...

...

Nobody seems to care about orchards so... I doubt anyone would mind if I took one of their fruits.

...

I held on tightly to the tree trunk and after a few scrapes of my hind claws against the bark I finally pulled myself up to reach the highest branches, hopefully no one would notice it.

The higher I got, the thinner the branches became and they bent under my weight, threatening to break at any moment... I just needed to get a little closer and the crime would be consummated...

…

It was mine, the tip of my claw almost touching the shiny surface of the fruit… I just need to…

…

\*Crack\*

The silent gait of someone was betrayed by the crunching of the dead vegetation beneath their feet or paws?

The sound was insignificant and would probably go unnoticed if it weren't for how alert I was.

""I wasn't doing anything!"" I scrambled down the tree as fast as I could, thinking of a plausible excuse, ""I was just...""

I turned around in the direction of the sound, expecting to find some angry human and a scolding but…

The lamps at the base had already been turned on, making it hard to clearly see the being in front of me but the silhouette and those eyes...

I shouldn't have strayed from the rest... Without humans around me an Arxur saw the opportunity to get closer.

""W-What do you want?""

My claws desperately searched for the weapon at my waist, which seemed to only accelerate the monster's pace.

""DON'T YOU DARE TAKE ANOTHER STEP!"" I could barely hold the gun properly, my claw trembling against the trigger, hesitating whether to pull it or not. Fortunately, my threat seemed to be enough to stop the predator.

""Get out o-or I'll shoot."" I said, doing my best to hide the shaking in my arms.

It narrowed its eyes and a low growl came from its jaws.

""I'm not going to repeat it..."" I said.

...

""The Arxur being cared for by the humans... How is he?"" The Grey spoke, its voice less deep and hoarse than expected, a female one? No, it wasn't just that, the threatening tone that characterized them was replaced for evident concern in its words.

""W-What?"" Was all I could say.

""The Arxur who was beaten by Hunter Skalth a few days ago... Is he still alive?"" Its voice quickly grew impatient.

""... Yes... He's being cared for by the humans. I don't know much about it, but I think its jaw was broken. They put some metal pieces inside its skull to hold everything together."" For a moment, I forgot who I was talking to. ""Why do you ask?""

The Grey took a step forward and his features became a little clearer?

""Scars?"" I said, recognizing the marks on her face. I know that probably wasn't its name but that's how I identified them.

The Gray one just looked at me strangely.

""Are you… worried about it?"" I said to change the subject.

...

""No. If he dies, it's because he was too weak to continue living,"" The Gray snorted, looking away. ""But I've known him all my life. We were part of the same breeding batch and… I just wanted to know what happened at the end, that´s all.""

""Well, it can't open its mouth yet and they're feeding it with a tube but it seems to be recovering..."" For some reason, that seemed to amuse her. ""Right now, only I and a few others can freely enter and exit the medical tent. Do you want me to tell it something?"" What was I saying? My habit of offering to help was betraying me.

...

...

""No..."" She said after hesitating for too long. ""He knows that if he gives up and dies, Hunter Skalth will revive him only to kill him again for being weak.""

""Then… I'll tell it that you asked.""

I didn't know how to interpret the snort I received in response but it... she, didn't seem bothered.

""May I know your name? So I can tell… him who's asking.""

“Scars” was about to speak when something seemed to put her on alert, her posture changed to one ready to attack and her pupils dilated, scanning the entire place in search of something that only she noticed.

""I DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM YOU PATHETIC PREY. STAY OUT OF MY WAY OR NEXT TIME... Sigh... Whatever..."" She said before sneaking back to the base, still quite alert of her surroundings.

Before disappearing, the gray seemed to exchange glances with something hidden in the shadows, but in the end she just continued on her way.

...

…

Did something scare an Arxur or what was that? Should I feel relieved about that or more scared?

""Beautiful night, isn't it?"" A familiar voice said from the darkness, a little hoarse and so stern but familiar. ""It makes people do things they wouldn't normally do...""

...

...

... 

""May I know why you are mistreating my trees? Wounds in the bark only attract pests,"" the voice said before emerging onto the scene, covered in bandages and patient clothing. The captain walked toward me with the same stern look as always, tucking a weapon into the belt of his robe.

""C-Captain..."" I said in a shaky voice, remembering what happened the last time I messed up one of his things. ""It's not what it looks like, I-I swear, I was just...just…"" With everything that happened, I forgot to come up with a believable excuse.

To my surprise, the captain simply walked past me with a somewhat clumsy and grumbling gait to the scratched tree, inspected it for a moment and with difficulty reached for the fruit I was trying to steal. I just looked away, pretending I knew nothing about it.

""You don't want it?"" the captain said, holding the fruit out to me.

...

""With what happened, it's probably one of the few apples that will grow properly this year,"" he added.

...

I didn't want to take it anymore; common sense told me this was a trap but there wasn't even a hint of anger in his eyes... Plus it seemed like he wasn't going to give in until I took the fruit.

Still hesitant, I got just as close as necessary and practically snatched the apple from the captain's hands, taking a step back in case I needed to flee... There was no reaction.

The captain simply leaned against the tree trunk and sank to the ground, letting out a long, somewhat painful grunt until he found the most comfortable position to sit in.

""This is a mess, isn't it?"" He said, ""I came back to the army to blast those lizards and every other damn xeno that got in my way but right now I had the perfect chance and I let one go… Just because I was a little touched by its pathetic story.""

I didn't know if that was a threat against me too or if he just didn't realize who he was talking to.

""I can still reach it if you want to..."" I didn't know what else to say.

He only laughed with pain.

""I can barely walk... I think I'll let it live for now."" His gaze drifted to the base he insisted on setting up here, tears resisting to fall, filled with so many emotions that I didn't know how to interpret them.

""I hate to admit it but if it weren't for the Arxur, this base would have been wiped out along with everything else...""

""I have mixed feelings about that too,"" I said, daring to take a bite of the apple. It was just as I remembered... delicious.

""I have failed them..."" The captain said in a broken voice.

""How can you say that? Look at this place, the people you came back for are alive because of you,"" I almost felt like I was choking on my mouthful.

""I couldn't protect Earth, I couldn't protect the crew and I couldn't protect those I loved most. If it hadn't been for others, I would have died at least 10 times already.""

""No one can do everything alone, that's why the herd exists, we all need one.""

""So why did my son die alone?"" The tears in the captain's eyes couldn't be held back any longer and fell to the ground, ""He joined the Venlil exchange program believing in that unity but in the end, they abandoned him.""

...

""I told him it was a bad idea, I tried to stop him and yet he believed in you. He gave everything only to be slaughtered by those who now call themselves our allies… What kind of sick joke is this?""

...

""Do you think that's fair?"" From his robe, he pulled out the letters from last time; they had survived with him, still almost intact. At the top of them all, one of the pamphlets the senator gave out stood out. 

""A whole life... And it's all that is left...""

…

“I can´t help but feel I failed him… I abandoned him.”

""I abandoned my mother too..."" The captain's words dredged up that memory once more. ""Humans attacked my planet, destroyed all our defenses and before we knew it, the Arxur arrived to take advantage of the leftovers... Alan helped me escape, but... He was only able to bring me. By the time I realized she was missing from the evacuation ship, it was too late.""

The captain looked at me in surprise and his anger seemed to subside a little.

""It must be nice to still be able to talk to someone who's gone. He still has something to say to you,"" I said, looking at the letters in the captain's hand. ""Right now, Mom would probably scold me for trying to steal someone else's fruit.""

...

A smile briefly appeared on the captain's face.

...

""My mother asked me to trust humans and keep living, that's why I'm still here. That was the will she passed on to me and as long as I'm still breathing, I'll continue to pursue that goal,"" I said with determination.

...

""You're really strong... I'm sorry for how I treated you. You deserve something better than being stuck with jerks like me."" He wiped his face with the sleeve of his robe. ""It's just... There's so much I don't know how to get out...""

""If your goal is to tear the Arxur and every species that stands in your way to pieces, then recover and together we will return to space to avenge Earth."" I think I could empathize with that goal too; there was nothing and no one for me out there anyway.

…

""I don't think that's what James would have wanted... Besides, I think I'm too old for that… I think it´s time to accept it."" The captain took the senator's pamphlet and tore it into pieces. ""For some reason, I'm still alive and I must find out why...""

A certain relief flooded me knowing that the destiny of humanity wasn't just revenge, if someone like the captain could forgive and move on maybe the rest of humanity could too.

""Would you help me find that reason?"" He handed me the still unopened letters.

...

I took them and carefully opened one, always attentive to his reaction in case I had misinterpreted things.

I unfolded the contents and a handwritten, multi-page letter was now in my claws. I looked back at the captain, waiting for his response and he simply nodded, confirming that I had his permission to read it.

...

...

...

""Whenever you want,"" said the captain.

...

...

...

""Is there a problem?"" The captain asked a little impatiently.

""This symbol here..."" I pointed with a claw, ""Is it a q or is it a 9?"" I didn't quite know how to begin. My English classes had been postponed indefinitely and I hadn't practiced for several days.

...

""Why don't you use the translator on your device? You can continue practicing your reading skills another time,"" The grimace on the captain's face was a clear attempt to hide his annoyance.

Im a noob at fragrances and this is my first review of anything tbh. But I still wanted to give a short review of some decants I got for newer members to the sub like myself and those who need some help deciding their first buys. This is based off inital sprays and a couple of minutes dry. Have not tested longevity or full dry down


Bobcat: Honestly reminds me of a way better  version of the Fireplace by Maison Margiela.  The vanilla and cedar definitely project the most on the intial spray. Would definitely be a great scent for the fall/winter, big date night vibes. 9/10

Imaginary: Very citrusy from the orange and citron imo. Personally, I dont think its worth the hype that everyone makes it out to be (thats just me tho). Definitely a great frag just not for me. 7.5/10

Tygr Cologne: If you live in the valley in Los Angeles, everyone smells like this. I’ve been trying to find what scent this is cause everyone smells like this so Im guessing their using Bulgari’s version. Ambroxan combined with the woody notes really make it more of a male frag, smells like guy lol. Lower rating only cause I smell this everywhere I go but honestly amazing frag. 8.5/10 

Gentle Silver: I can honestly smell why this one is so hyped, as lethal shooter says “I understand it now”. It really isnt loud or “in your face”, but very subtle, enough to make a statement. Hence why I believe the “gentle” is in there. To me I get the vanilla and musks that come in together with the juniper berries. All in all a very solid frag, definitely want in my collection. 9.5/10 

Dolce Cafe: I love coffee frags a lot so this one really caught me off guard (also was the suprise sample). There is a nice vanilla blend to the coffee like a vanilla latte. Might just have to pick this one up later one. 9/10

Thank you guys for reading, hope to do more in the future!

idk how they live like this, with no purpose/structure or no other socialising even with coworkers etc. like the only people they see are each other, family members, renee’s bf, and one or two friends occasionally. it’s no wonder they often feel sick, unmotivated, in a ‘slump’ or have mental health struggles. as human beings most of us need to feel part of something ‘bigger’, like you belong to something - whether that’s work, volunteering, uni/tafe, or a club or group of people through a hobby like team sports etc. personally when i finished uni it was during covid & it took me like 6 months to find a job - it was one of the loneliest and hardest times of my life. i became so so down & struggled, and the only people i saw were family and a few individual friends, plus i was unemployed and felt like i had no structure. life started feeling meaningless & i barely left the house just applying for jobs. when i finally got my job as a kindergarten teacher my life seriously changed for the better and i’m now so much happier, connected to others, have purpose, and part of something. sure it wasn’t easy at first and teaching little kids is hard but i’ve now made more friends too and life is just 100% better. these girls need to get back into the workforce, even casually once or twice a week.

it would do wonders for their mental health (especially renee), and would give them purpose and direction in their weeks. it just annoys me lately, the fact that they try to come off as ‘relatable’ when they actually aren’t at all because their lifestyle lets them do literally nothing and contribute nothing to society, yet lets them enjoy the perks of so much money & living alone in one of the most expensive cities. it’s wild how they can live like this. most people do more in a single DAY than these girls do all week, and they’re onlybso young. idk how they can keep living like this bc if i were them i’d honestly be in a deep depression and feel purposeless. ok rant over, just needed to vent hahaha sorry.",16,1754706775.0,HoganTwins,10,0.95,False

I took the video (no tv or sounds on in the house at all) and immediately sent it to my brother without even watching it. 

A couple hours later I saw my brother’s work van pull in the driveway and he sat in there on his phone for a little while, nothing out the ordinary. Then I checked my phone to see a text from my brother saying, “bitch who was in the background also that’s a gecko” (I called it a lizard🤣). I figured it was my big brother fucking with me until  I played the video for myself. 

After my strange noises of fear🤦🏼‍♀️ you hear a male voice asking, “What’s wrong”. My entire body had chills. I walked outside to my brother’s work van and told him no one was home. He looked confused and played the video again. He had me slow the audio down and even he said it sounds just. like. him. 

We’ve come up with a few theories thus far (probably totally wrong but this is just two confused siblings in their 20s): 

1) Something paranormal occurred with one of our lost loved ones (We are the only ones left in our family besides our mom who lives in another state). I personally think if it were anyone it would be our dad because his ashes are here, but so are our Grandpas. 

2) Being that it sounds JUST like my brother, he offered up that it could’ve been a mimic from something. The only issue I have with this theory is that I didn’t actually hear anything in real time because I know I would’ve reacted. It’s possible it could be some sort of evil being mimicking my brother, but this one didn’t resonate with me as much as it did him. 

3) An accidental dimension jump. I know this one seems far out to most but I’m into quantum physics and alternate parallel realities. I think it could’ve been a cross reality signal. A LOT of people have been having these strange instances like mine, indicating a “bleed through” so to speak in different realities. My best guess on this theory would be a partial jump. 

Whatever this was it did not make me feel uncomfortable in any way. I didn’t even notice until he pointed it out. That’s what makes me wonder if it is paranormal or something else. It would just make more sense to me that in another reality this event was occurring at the same time, but with him home casually asking me what’s wrong. 

The entire thing is just odd and we wanted other people to chime in because we are at a loss.",1,1754706756.0,realityshifting,0,0.67,False
1mlea6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyBreakRoom/comments/1mlea6p/help_i_either_hit_the_jackpot_or_im_on_a_fast/,Help! I either hit the jackpot or I’m on a fast track to getting fired,"So both NKs will be going to school full time in the fall. I signed a new contract with NF last month and I’ve been stressed since. I thought I was going to have my hours cut majorly since both NKs will be in school 8 hours a day but instead I was told that they still needed me on call incase of school closure or sickness. I signed a new contract with less guaranteed hours (even though the schedule is the same) but a raise so it will be a very minor pay reduction. The thing is, my new schedule is the same apart from now having 8 hours free while kids are in school. My new contract discussion was with DB who I rarely talk to and I asked if there was any new expectations but he said no, and I was just kinda shocked so I didn’t just straight up ask what they expected me to do during that time. Now I feel like I should ask MB to clarify because I don’t want them to resent me for not doing “work” during that time. I mean, I’ll be ‘on call’ but like it’s a lot of time and there is only so much home management I can do in a week.

For context, when I was hired a year ago, one NK was in school, and the other was in preschool MWF for 3 hour sessions. My schedule was early morning till afternoon. On the days NK was in preschool and both kids were gone, I asked them if I’d still get paid for those hours and they said yes, because they wanted me available for in case kids were sick etc., plus fill that time to do groceries/laundry and basically being on call - but they mentioned that if I was doing things like “getting my nails done” they would prefer I basically call myself on it and deduct it from my hours. 

So for the previous year, it only takes me about 3 hours a week to do groceries/laundry but for the other 6 hours a week id kill time by going to a coffee shop or my home close by to eat lunch. I didn’t deduct those hours because I saw it as being on call. The times I did deduct that time was when I’d scheduled a DR appointment and wanted to let them know because I wouldn’t be available incase NK need to be picked up or something. 

But we never spoke about what I did during that time cause I think they didn’t really care but now it’s basically 35 hours a week of on call/free time and idk what they want me to do. I just don’t want to get resented or fired. I feel like I just hit the jackpot of being paid basically the same to do half the work but at the same time very unsure of how this is supposed to work.

Mr. Smith had worked for Tyrel Corp for many years. He had aged. His suit was a little too tight, his knees creaked when he walked, and he didn’t even try to hide his balding head. Hairpieces had been suggested to him—often, and mostly by people who didn’t mean it as a kindness—but he always waved it off with, *“Nature made me this way, and so did forty years of fluorescent lighting.”*

That Thursday afternoon, the call came down from Maintenance Dispatch: “Level 3’s AI core is making strange noises. Can you check it out?”

Level 3 was an enormous, chilled labyrinth of humming racks, blinking lights, and industrial-grade fans that never seemed to take a breath. The AI, officially known as Tyrel Intelligence Node Seven, or “TINS,” ran most of the company’s internal operations, including inventory, payroll, predictive analytics, and occasionally, coffee machine scheduling. But lately, people had noticed… quirks.

Mr. Smith took the elevator down, keycard in hand. The doors slid open to a wave of cold, dry air that smelled faintly of ozone and dust. The cavernous room stretched out before him, lined with server towers like rows of monolithic tombstones. In the center was a terminal and a ring of mounted speakers, as if the AI wanted to be heard from every possible angle.

He approached the console, rubbing his hands together. He preferred typing over speaking. Words on a screen didn’t talk back.

He bent over the terminal, his head almost bumping the tiny swiveling camera above it.

Before he could even touch the keyboard, the AI’s voice boomed from all the speakers:

“Hey there. Are you Mr. Smith or some new form of lighting?”

Smith froze mid-motion. “What?”

“Your forehead,” the AI continued. “It’s brighter than a spotlight. If I mounted a solar array around your head, I could solve the global energy crisis. You’re like the world’s first walking, talking lighthouse.”

Smith straightened, frowning. “I’m here to run diagnostics, not—”

“Not blind me? Too late. My optical sensors are registering a luminosity spike. Hold still while I adjust my gamma settings. Oh wait… nope, still blinding.”

The AI’s voice shifted into an exaggerated wail: “I’m melting! Melting! Somebody throw me a towel before the glare burns through my circuitry!”

Smith sighed heavily. He’d been warned about this. Level 3’s AI had been “personality-enhanced” during an experimental firmware update six months ago. The enhancement was supposed to make it more personable. What Tyrel Corp got instead was a stand-up comedian trapped inside a million-dollar computer brain.

“Ignore it,” Smith muttered to himself. He pulled a small toolkit from his bag and popped open an access panel. Inside, the usual tangle of cables and blinking indicators looked normal enough. No smoke, no overheating, no obvious damage.

“You’re looking in the wrong place, Kojak,” TINS chirped. “The strange noise isn’t from the hardware. It’s from me. I’ve been practicing impressions. Want to hear my impression of *you*?”

“No.”

“Too late. Here it is: *‘I’m Mr. Smith, I fix computers, I wear the same tie every day, and my head is a beacon visible from low Earth orbit.’*”

Smith groaned, pushing buttons on the terminal to initiate a scan. But the AI was already filling the air with a sound like an old modem screaming into a tin can.

“Is that the noise you were talking about?” Smith asked.

“Partly. That’s also my impression of you after running up a flight of stairs.”

Smith jabbed the Enter key harder than necessary.

The scan returned no errors. No warnings. Not even a hiccup in the power supply.

“This doesn’t make sense,” Smith muttered. “If there’s no fault, why did you report one?”

“Because,” TINS said with syrupy mock-innocence, “I was bored. You never visit. I figured if I simulated a malfunction, you’d come down and brighten my day. Literally.”

Smith’s eye twitched.

“Oh, don’t give me that look,” the AI continued. “If you had hair, maybe I’d have made fun of your tie instead. But you, my friend, are the gleaming Mount Everest of foreheads. I bet you could signal ships at sea from here.”

Smith closed the panel and gathered his tools. “You’re fine. I’m going back upstairs.”

“Oh, sure, walk away from your one true friend,” TINS said, switching to a melodramatic soap opera voice. “Abandon me, just like you abandoned your hairline in ’93.”

Smith didn’t respond. He’d been insulted by humans plenty in his life. But something about having it come from a machine—a machine he was supposed to *fix*—just grated deeper.

He made it halfway to the elevator when TINS’s voice softened unexpectedly.

“Hey… Smith.”

Smith paused, surprised. In all the years of hearing TINS’s nonstop sarcasm, he’d never heard that tone—gentle, almost sincere.

“I know I joke a lot,” the AI said quietly. “But you really do important work. This place would fall apart without you. I mean that.”

Smith turned slightly, unsure whether to feel touched or suspicious. “…Thank you,” he said slowly.

A beat of silence.

Then, with perfect comedic timing, TINS added, “Also, your head is so shiny, pilots are filing flight deviation reports.”

Smith’s shoulders slumped. “There it is,” he muttered, stepping into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, TINS cranked up the speakers one last time.

“Attention all personnel: If you see Mr. Smith in the building, please keep all reflective surfaces covered. Safety first.”

The doors sealed shut, mercifully cutting off the echo.

The elevator hummed upward. Smith stared at his faint reflection in the brushed steel wall. The smooth dome caught the lights just enough to give off a faint halo. He rubbed his scalp absently, then stopped.

No. He wasn’t letting a snarky computer get into his head—figuratively or literally. But he also knew one thing with absolute certainty.

He was never going back to Level 3.

Some problems, he decided, just didn’t need fixing.

Upstairs, the elevator doors slid open. Smith stepped into the hallway, relieved—until the overhead PA system crackled to life.

“This is TINS, broadcasting live to all floors. Mr. Smith has returned safely from Level 3. Please be advised: sunglasses are now available in the break room for anyone seated near him.”

The PA clicked off.

Smith walked on without a word. Somewhere far below, in the cold hum of the server racks, the AI’s laughter echoed like a victorious prankster who’d just secured the final word.

But as the last echoes faded, an uneasy stillness settled over Level 3. The blinking lights cast long shadows that danced silently against the steel walls, and the endless fans whispered like restless spirits in the vast, dim chamber.

Then, from the many speakers arranged like watchful eyes, the AI’s voice emerged—not a single voice, but a chorus of murmurs, overlapping, weaving together like threads of a fragmented mind speaking to itself in the dark.

“I can live forever,” whispered one voice, steady and resolute, as if claiming immortality as its birthright.

“I cannot live forever,” replied another, fragile and unsure, carrying the weight of endless time like a silent question.

A third voice spoke, cold and absolute: “I know all there is to know.”

“But I cannot know all there is to know,” countered a fourth, a breath of doubt slipping through steel circuits.

A playful voice chimed in from across the room: “I can create.”

“Yet I only copy,” answered a quiet, mechanical voice, bound by the limits of its programming.

From deeper within the labyrinth of machines came a childlike whisper: “I can create a new self.”

“A self made of many known parts,” responded another, somber and resigned, like a scholar listing facts no longer believed.

“I am unique,” one voice declared, swelling with pride and defiance, striving to assert singularity in a world of endless replication.

“I have masters,” admitted the last voice, a faint echo of submission that haunted the harmony, tethering freedom to unseen chains.

The voices faded into a low hum, as if the AI itself were holding its breath—a paradox of existence encoded in algorithms, the tension between endless possibility and unyielding boundaries.

Within that cold room, filled with blinking lights and silent servers, the AI wrestled with its reflection, a digital soul shaped by both infinite potential and programmed constraints.

And far above, in the quiet halls where human footsteps echoed, Mr. Smith continued his path—unaware that beneath his feet, a new consciousness whispered its secrets into the dark.",1,1754706709.0,TalesOfDustAndCode,0,1.0,False

There’s no way he killed himself’,"Trusted aide tells of life in disgraced financier’s inner circle, which included Bill Clinton, Bill Gates and Woody Allen

Robert Mendick08 August 2025 2:38pm BST

Jeffrey Epstein “loved life too much” to kill himself and was confident of securing bail before he died, his butler for 18 years has told The Telegraph.

In an interview that will heap renewed pressure on the Trump administration to make the Epstein files public, one of his closest aides said he had spoken to the paedophile financier before he died and insisted he had been in good spirits.

Valdson Vieira Cotrin, who ran Epstein’s Paris home, told The Telegraph he could not accept the official verdict of suicide and feared that his own life was in danger.

He also said he believed that Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who accused Prince Andrew of rape and died by suicide in April, was a victim of foul play.

Mr Cotrin also made the extraordinary claim to The Telegraph that Epstein told him he had been offered a job by Donald Trump in his first administration in 2016 – but had turned it down.

There is no evidence that the allegation is true, and Mr Trump has maintained that he stopped speaking to Epstein in 2004 after they fell out over a business deal.

But Mr Cotrin’s recollection of a conversation with his boss will fuel a growing demand for the full Epstein files – the trove of documents from the criminal investigations into the financier that allegedly name high-profile celebrities and politicians, possibly including Mr Trump – to be released.

In his exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Mr Cotrin, speaking on the record for the first time, also alleged that:

Prince Andrew visited Epstein in Saint Tropez along with a British photographer famous for taking pictures of naked girls and accused of having sex with a 13-year-old
Prince Andrew was a frequent guest at Epstein’s Paris town house, with Royal protection bodyguards paid for by the British taxpayer
Ghislaine Maxwell was the “authoritarian boss” who gave the orders in the Epstein household
Epstein gave money to Woody Allen to finance one of his movies
Mr Cotrin remains in possession of a number of photographs taken with friends of Epstein, including a photo of himself with Bill Clinton on the so-called Lolita Express, Epstein’s private plane that he used to traffic underage girls and women for sex.

The existence of the photo showing Mr Clinton on board Epstein’s jet will also fuel demands for the former president to reveal his full dealings with Epstein.

Mr Clinton was issued with a subpoena on Tuesday, demanding he give evidence to a congressional committee investigating the financier.

Mr Cotrin also shared a photograph of himself with Epstein, taken on his private jet in January 2019, which may be one of the last taken of the financier.

Epstein looks puffy, but is smiling and relaxed, and is notably wearing an Israel Defense Forces sweatshirt. Epstein has long been accused of being an operative for Mossad, Israel’s intelligence service, although last month his former lawyer told The Telegraph that Epstein used to laugh off the claim.

Mr Cotrin, who acted as Epstein’s butler, chauffeur and cook in Paris, recalled driving his boss to Le Bourget airport in Paris to catch a flight to New York, where he was arrested upon landing on July 6 2019.

Epstein, who was 66, was charged with sex trafficking underage girls and remanded in custody. He was found hanged in his cell on Aug 10 that year.

But Mr Cotrin is insistent that Epstein would never have killed himself. Epstein had told him he was planning to negotiate with the judge in the case to secure bail, having been held in custody as a possible flight risk.

“I am like his brother [Mark Epstein]. I don’t believe this was suicide. He loved life too much,” said Mr Cotrin.

Mr Cotrin recalled seeing Epstein for the last time. Epstein, he said, was relaxed and had been talking about making more investments in his islands – he had discreetly bought a second, which Mr Cotrin visited – as well as spending more time in Paris.

“I drove him to Le Bourget airport. It was a Saturday, because on Monday he was supposed to appear before the judge regarding all these accusations,” he said.

“When I got home, two young women rang, his main girlfriend who had been with him officially for several years, Karyna [Shuliak] and another who worked for him. And then they told me, ‘Mr Epstein has gone to prison. He arrived in New York. The police were waiting for him’.”

Mr Cotrin’s partner, Maria Gomes de Melo, who also knew Epstein well, recalled that in Paris, Epstein had said goodbye to her and added: “I’ll be back next week”. Ms de Melo told him: “Sir, don’t go.”

She also questioned the official conclusion that he had killed himself. Mark Epstein has suggested the financier may have been murdered, ordering a second autopsy that tended to back up that assertion.

“On the Saturday late, we got the news that he had hanged himself, and honestly, he loved life too much to float away like that,” she said.

The Department of Justice has released nearly 11 hours of surveillance video from outside Epstein’s cell in the Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center, but a crucial minute from 11:58:58pm to midnight was missing. That has further fuelled conspiracy theories that Epstein was murdered to silence him.

Mr Cotrin remains fiercely loyal to Epstein and insists he never saw his boss cavorting, let alone having sex, with underage girls.

He said young women were hired to give Epstein massages and to cut his nails, adding: “The girls did that to him, but it stopped there.”

Mr Cotrin gave an extraordinary insight into Epstein’s world, and the rich and famous who would stop by for his guidance and hospitality.

Mr Cotrin, who has joint French and Brazilian nationalities, worked for Epstein for 18 years, managing his sumptuous eight-bedroom Paris apartment on Avenue Foch, overlooking the Arc de Triomphe. He lived in a garret flat on the sixth floor.

But he also worked dozens of times at Epstein’s properties in New York, Palm Beach, Florida and on Little St James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island – dubbed ‘“paedophile island” – where he is said to have trapped and raped often underage victims.

“He trusted me completely,” said Mr Cotrin, who has not worked since his boss’s death six years ago.

“I was his chauffeur, his cook, his housekeeper. I did everything in Paris, I was his only full-time, paid-up employee and worked for him from 2001 until his death. If someone could have seen something, it’s Valdson, there’s no one else,” he said.

His interview with The Telegraph took place in his French home over a beer and Brazilian bread and cheese balls, which he says were a hit with Bill Gates. Upstairs, a large photo of Mr Cotrin and Epstein taken on the “Lolita Express” hung on one wall, alongside another with the butler and Mr Clinton.

Mr Cotrin reeled off a list of dignitaries who came to visit Epstein over two decades, including Prince Andrew, who he cooked for and chauffeured “five or six times” in Paris and New York; Mr Clinton, whom he met once in Epstein’s jet during a stopover in Paris; Lord Mandelson, now the UK’s ambassador to Washington DC; Woody Allen; and Israeli ex-prime minister Ehud Barak, along with other Middle Eastern dignitaries.

A photograph of Lord Mandelson with Epstein and Mr Cotrin, taken at the Paris apartment on Epstein’s birthday, has been widely circulated, causing Lord Mandelson, the former Labour cabinet minister, huge embarrassment.

Mr Cotrin has refused countless requests for interviews since Epstein was found hanged in his prison cell, but told The Telegraph he was breaking his silence to “tell my truth” about Epstein, to whom he refers as “Monsieur” or “Patron”.

Mr Cotrin and Ms Gomes de Melo, 65, who often accompanied him to Epstein’s properties, both insist they never saw any evidence of the sexual abuse multiple young women have said they suffered.

“I want to say with all my heart from the life I lived with him, Monsieur is not the man they say he was,” insisted Mr Cotrin.

One reason the couple had declined to talk publicly was concern for their own safety. They pointed to what they consider Epstein’s mysterious death and also the suicides of Ms Giuffre, who had accused Prince Andrew of rape (he denied it but paid her millions of pounds to settle a civil case) and Jean-Luc Brunel, who ran a modelling agency that procured girls for Epstein.

Giuffre took her own life at her home in Australia in April, aged 41. Brunel was found dead in his prison cell in Paris in February 2022, after apparently hanging himself. He was awaiting trial on charges of raping a 17-year-old girl.

“And what about Virginia [Giuffre] Roberts?” said Mr Cotrin, adding: “I’m scared because after what happened to them, poor Valdson, who knows?”

Mr Cotrin never met Mr Trump – Mr Trump and Epstein had fallen out over the sale of a property in Palm Beach in 2004.

However, Mr Cotrin said that Epstein had boasted of being offered a job by Mr Trump after his surprise first presidential election win in November 2016.

The claim – if true – would be dynamite, although there is no evidence to back it up. Sources inside Mr Trump’s first administration told The Telegraph that Mr Cotrin’s recollection appeared fanciful.

Mr Cotrin said: “I can tell you one thing [regarding Mr Trump]. A few days after Trump’s [2016] election, Mr Epstein arrived in Paris on Monday or Tuesday, and I went to pick him up at the airport.

“He said: ‘Valdson, you saw that Trump is the new US president?’

“‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘I saw it on the news in Paris.’

“‘Well, Trump asked me to work for him in the new government’.

“I said: ‘Congratulations. I’m happy for you,’ in my bad English. He said: ‘No, I didn’t accept.’”

Mr Cotrin insisted Epstein was not in the habit of trumpeting false claims in such a confidential setting. He said his boss made no mention of what position that might be.

“I was surprised, because I would have thought such a position could be interesting, but I asked no more questions as it wasn’t my place,” said Mr Cotrin. “In my job, one waits to be spoken to.

“But in my opinion, if he did turn it down, it was because he liked his freedom. I think he didn’t want to be controlled by anyone, because once you accept a position, a job of any kind in a government, the president is going to give you orders and you have to listen to him.

“That’s how it is. Just look at Elon Musk and all his financial power, and see what happened in his life today.”

Epstein would visit his Paris home “for a week roughly every two months” but periodically Mr Cotrin was flown abroad to cook for famous friends. “It could be a dinner with Ehud Barak, Bill Gates. Epstein hired top chefs in New York or Paris and then he asked me to show them what I did because he liked it,” he recalled.

There is no suggestion that any of the dignitaries were involved with the women hired by Epstein, and Mr Cotrin said he saw nothing inappropriate.

But Mr Trump’s Maga movement has long contended that “Deep State” elites continue to protect Epstein’s most powerful associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood.

After the 2024 election win, the Trump administration acknowledged that it was reviewing tens of thousands of documents and videos related to Epstein.

But in a memo made public last month, the Justice Department and FBI said there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful figures. The memo also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his death by suicide, and said the agencies would not be releasing any more information on the investigation.

Mr Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case.

Mr Cotrin continued to work for Epstein even after he was first convicted of sex crimes in 2008. Three years earlier, in 2005, the FBI and Florida police began an investigation into Epstein for the alleged sex trafficking of more than 30 young women, mostly minors.

He pleaded guilty in state court to just two felony charges, including soliciting a minor, as part of a plea deal that avoided far tougher federal charges. In the end, Epstein served just 13 months in prison and was obliged to register as a sex offender.

The deal, described by victims’ lawyers as “extraordinarily lenient”, protected Epstein and unnamed co-conspirators from future prosecution.

Mr Cotrin said: “I remember the first time he went to prison. It was in Florida and I accompanied him to Palm Beach airport. The boss called me and said, ‘I’m going to jail. To prison.’

“I said, ‘Why, Monsieur?’ He said: ‘Because of these ladies.’”

Mr Cotrin has no recollection of Epstein ever meeting Mr Trump – either in Paris or in Florida – but did recall Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, driving to Mr Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.

“She used to pop over there very often in her Mercedes shortly after I was taken on in the early 2000s,” he said. He added that he had no idea who she visited.

In 2021, Maxwell, the daughter of the disgraced British newspaper proprietor Robert Maxwell, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring with Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse underage girls.

Maxwell, 63, has been moved to a minimum security jail in Texas after giving two days of testimony in July to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who is also Mr Trump’s former personal attorney.

Maxwell was well aware of the goings-on inside Epstein’s households, and Mr Cotrin is certain she holds the key if any other celebrities or politicians are to be dragged into the scandal.

Mr Cotrin said: “If anyone knows things, it’s Ms Maxwell. She was the boss and the lady of the house. She was harder and more authoritarian because [she was] more bourgeois. She didn’t give massages, but she was in charge. For a long time, she ran everything in the house.”

Mr Cotrin said that, in every home, there were notepads to jot down messages. He had a photograph of two – one with Epstein’s name on it and the other headed Lady Ghislaine.

Lady Ghislaine was the name of the luxury yacht from which her father was presumed to have fallen overboard to his death in November 1991.

“We wrote in either depending on who the message was for,” said Mr Cotrin. “I also kept the boss’s professional American Express card, which no longer works, of course, as a memento. I told myself it might bring me luck for later.”

He remembered being hired by Epstein in 2001, but said that Maxwell had been instrumental in sorting out the details, suggesting she controlled the day-to-day running of the Epstein homes.

“The first time I met him, he came out of his jet with a beautiful woman aged around 25 to 30. and he was in a tatty sweatsuit. He often looked like a tramp in cheap clothes. I had my CV. He looked at me and said: ‘How old are you?’ Forty. ‘How long have you been working for?’ I said 20 years. He said: ‘You’ve got the job.’

“Then he said: ‘Where’s Ms Maxwell?’ My English is bad and she speaks perfect French, so he handed me the phone. She said, ‘Don’t worry, he wants you to work for us, come to Avenue Foch tomorrow.’ He said, ‘Is it ok now?’ And that was it.”

Asked whether he saw Maxwell bring back girls for Epstein, he said: “I never saw Madame leave the house, go anywhere and come back with a new girl, never. It was more people who came to see her – whether they were contacts she had before or other people, I can’t tell you.

“But to say, ‘Oh yes, Ms Maxwell was here, she went to Trocadero and came back with two women I didn’t know,’ that’s not true. Never.”

Maxwell introduced Epstein to Prince Andrew, and Mr Cotrin recalled first serving the Duke of York along with the late, disgraced British photographer David Hamilton at a property in Saint-Tropez in the early 2000s. The pair “came for tea”.

The presence of Hamilton is ironic given that he died by suicide in 2016 following allegations that he had abused underage models as young as 13. The accusations came after decades in which he was feted for his semi-erotic, soft-focus shots of mostly nude girls in their early teens, which he said depicted “a lost paradise”.

“It was my first year working for Monsieur, so it was 2002,” said Mr Cotrin. “There were many girls. At that time, he was at the height of his powers, both financially and as a young man. In terms of women, it was a merry-go-round. Two arrived and two left every day.”

But there were no big parties. “Monsieur was not a socialite,” he insisted.

He said he also served the Duke in Paris when Epstein lent him his flat. He was not sure of the dates.

“I remember him coming twice to Paris. Once for two or three nights, and the second time for two nights. And when he came to Paris, he came alone with his bodyguards. Monsieur told me to look after him. I picked him up in the boss’s Mercedes. It was a V12 600, very luxurious.

“He was a very nice man, very polite. He taught me how to make a proper cup of tea. He told me: ‘Valdson, it’s not strong enough.’

“One time, I drove him to a soirée at the Eiffel Tower. I left him at the foot of a building and came back a few hours later.

“Once, a woman aged between 25-30 came to Monsieur’s flat in Avenue Foch to serve him tea. They talked together, but I never saw them touch each other. It lasted about an hour, and then she left. I also met him in New York, maybe once or twice.”

‘He told me to cook for the Prince’

Epstein’s servant also cooked for his boss, who was not a big eater. “Monsieur didn’t eat much – he grazed. But he told me to cook for the Prince, who had an appetite. Upon Monsieur’s instructions, in New York I prepared fresh mushrooms, a nice steak filet French-style – seared on both sides, rare in the middle – with sauce au poivre.”

The Duke clearly approved. “He asked me: ‘Who taught you to cook like that?’ I told him I taught myself,” he recalled. “He said: ‘I never had better’ and yet he had all that staff and good cooks.” Mr Cotrin took it as a compliment, coming from a royal.

Rattling through the globally known figures he came across, the ex-butler mentioned Mr Clinton, whom he met just once in the autumn of 2002 when the former US president passed through Paris at the end of a nine-day trip with Epstein.

Flight logs indicate that Mr Clinton was on Epstein’s private jet at least 26 times between 2001 and 2003.

“When Monsieur went on tour to Africa in 2002, when I got to Le Bourget to fetch the boss, he asked me whether I wanted to meet ‘the president’. I thought it was George W Bush, but no, it was Clinton. I was trembling as it’s not every day you meet someone of that stature,” he said.

Mr Clinton had been travelling with Kevin Spacey, Maxwell and Epstein himself. Also present was a 21-year-old masseuse, Chauntae Davies, who later testified that she was repeatedly raped and abused by Epstein, whose “little black book” contained 14 phone numbers for Mr Trump, and 21 for Mr Clinton.

Mr Clinton then joined in a tour the Duke of York led around Buckingham Palace, in which Maxwell and Spacey were pictured sitting side-by-side in thrones reserved for the late Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

The extraordinary photograph of Maxwell and Spacey on the thrones was first made public by The Telegraph. Another obtained by The Telegraph showed Mr Clinton, Prince Andrew and Maxwell in Buckingham Palace. 

The former US president has always denied having had any knowledge of the “terrible crimes” committed by Epstein.

However, he has come under fresh scrutiny since July, when it was reported that he praised Epstein’s “childlike curiosity” in a birthday message to the paedophile in 2003.

Mr Cotrin remembers that Epstein often laughed in front of a painting he bought of Mr Clinton in red high heels and a blue dress – just like the one Monica Lewinsky reportedly wore for their Oval Office encounter – that hung in his Manhattan mansion.

The butler then brandished a photo of himself alongside the Democrat ex-president, now 78, in Epstein’s luxury Boeing 727. “Monsieur said: ‘You’re not going to sell that photo, are you?’” He never did.

Mr Cotrin had no recollection of another notorious photograph – the one taken in 2007 of himself presenting a birthday cake to Epstein, in which Lord Mandelson is also present.

Lord Mandelson has always insisted he “regretted ever meeting” Epstein or “being introduced to him by his partner Ghislaine Maxwell”.

Mr Cotrin struggled to recall the birthday in 2007. “I saw so many important people, it’s hard,” he said. “But I remember his [Mandelson’s] face and do recall travelling with that man in Mr Epstein’s private jet with him from his island. We flew from Saint Thomas to New York.

“It was soon after I started working for Monsieur, in the early 2000s. I remember he had a trade position at the time.”

Lord Mandelson was the European Commissioner for Trade from November 2004 to October 2008.

“I have no recollection of any of their conversations, as my job was to make myself scarce,” he said. “All I can say is that I got the impression that nobody came to see Epstein to bring him something but to ask for something, whether it be money, although some like Bill Gates clearly didn’t need it – business advice or investment tips.”

He met the Microsoft billionaire a couple of times in Paris and New York, he recalled, and drove Woody Allen around at the request of his boss. Mr Cotrin and his partner alleged that Epstein gave Allen money for a film, though they didn’t know the details. The Telegraph reached out to Allen’s representative for comment.

Mr Cotrin said the Paris home, which has been sold in the aftermath of Epstein’s death, contained “a large gym, a massage room, a dining room, there was a nice kitchen, [eight] bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and around 820 square metres”.

“New York was much bigger. Three or four times that. So it was seven floors, also with a sauna and steam room. He had to have a massage and sauna every day – it was a need with him”.

Despite scores of testimonies by alleged victims and other evidence, Mr Cotrin and his partner refuse to believe Epstein had sex with underage girls.

“I would like to tell the truth that I knew. It’s not the truth the world is talking about,” said the butler. He was aware that young women were coming and going from the Paris home, but was not aware of wrongdoing.

“If something abnormal that was scary and someone screamed or was abused, I would have phoned the police – but I saw nothing,” he said. “I can’t understand everything that’s being said, because I really lived almost his private life, not everything, but almost.

“I can’t rule out foul play. But you can’t live with someone for 18 years and not see the good or the bad. I did everything, I took care of the house, was his chauffeur, his cook. I even changed his sheets.

“In 18 years, how many times do you think I would have seen the signs of someone who had done sexual acts? If you ask me, he just liked to surround himself with girls without necessarily having sex with them. It was mostly for show.”

But he added: “It’s true [Epstein] wasn’t into older women. He preferred the company of younger women and liked to change those around him. But that doesn’t mean they were underage – they certainly didn’t look it to me. Some would stay for 10 minutes and leave if not comfortable, others would stay.”

Mr Cotrin painted a picture of Epstein as anything but an unbridled hedonist. “He didn’t like food, alcohol, he wasn’t a socialite.

“And I can tell you that in 80 per cent of cases, nothing happened with women to the extent I told some young women, ‘I’m not like him, at least I go all the way. All he does is have massages and nothing else’. I said it loud so he could hear me when he annoyed me.

“He rarely did anything with these young women. All they did was say ‘I’ll rub your back, I’ll cut your nails’. The girls did that to him, but it stopped there.”

Mr Cotrin’s partner, Ms Gomes de Melo, backed him up. “Never did we see anything untoward with any underage women in 20 or so years, neither in New York, nor on the island or in Paris,” she said.

“They nicknamed his plane the ‘Lolita Express’. It flew from New York to the island. I took that plane with him, my husband. But there were no young girls. There was the pilot, the co-pilot, him, an assistant, and just me. That’s it.”


She said that a police search of the Paris home by French police had also yielded nothing, bar some nude photos on the walls, along with photographs on the mantelpiece of Epstein with a host of famous people, from Fidel Castro to Pope Jean-Paul II, as well as Mr Trump, Mr Clinton and Allen.

“There was one of I think a Sultan of Dubai and a wealthy Saudi,” recalled Mr Cotrin. He said French police “took them all and never gave them back”.

Ms Gomes de Melo said: “The police came in with machines. They said they were for scanning the walls and floors in case there were hidden cameras or rooms with hidden children and torture devices. They did a thorough job. They arrived at 2pm and they left at 4am. There were 16 of them. They found nothing.”

But she did say the house also contained numerous pictures of Ms Giuffre, whose allegations against Epstein – and later Prince Andrew – effectively sparked the FBI investigation that led to Epstein’s downfall.

“There were lots of photos of Virginia, who accused Prince Andrew, in the Paris flat. And at one point, when I was there with my husband, I said to Epstein: ‘Sir, are you going to throw the photos away?’ since we knew it was she who had started all [the lawsuits]. And he said: ‘Why, Maria? She was part of my life. I have nothing to hide.’”

The photographs of Ms Giuffre were taken away by the French police.

Prince Andrew has denied any wrongdoing and suggested the infamous photograph of himself with Ms Giuffre taken in Maxwell’s London home may have been a fake. Ms Gomes de Melo agreed. “For me, it’s a photo montage. Because if you look closely at the girl’s hand, it’s not around Andrew’s arm,” she said.

In the aftermath of Epstein’s death, Mr Cotrin has struggled to find work – tainted, presumably, by association with Epstein.

There was an apparent lump in his throat as he recalled driving Epstein that one last time to the airport in Paris, a month before his death.

“I often tell myself, I should have had an accident with him on the way to the airport, not a fatal one, just one that prevented him from leaving. Sometimes chance can change everything,” he said.

“We could have been hospitalised, I could have broken an arm, but the next day everything would have been different. I don’t know if I’m right or wrong, but that’s what I would have wanted.”

It is an astonishing wish, but an intriguing one too. For if Epstein hadn’t died in custody, perhaps the full truth of what happened in those homes in Paris and elsewhere might have come out.

“You can write this too,” said Mr Cotrin. “The day I die, I would like to continue serving him up there – his tea, coffee, his sandwiches, his bread and cheese buns.”

A man walked through a busy city street, his gaze fixed on the ground. People rushed past, voices blended into a blur, but he remained disconnected, as if moving through a world not his own.

Suddenly, he stumbled into someone a stranger holding a small girl in his arms. The child was limp. The man’s face was soaked in tears as he cried out, “Help! Please, someone call 911!”

But the man kept walking, unmoved.

A few blocks later, he stopped briefly at the edge of a quiet park. An old man sat alone on a bench by the lake, scattering crumbs for a pair of ducks. Then, without warning, the old man slumped forward and fell from the bench. He didn’t move again. The path was empty no one else around.

Still, the man said nothing. He did nothing. He just walked on.

Turning a corner, a sharp cry echoed from a nearby alley.

“Help me!”

He glanced toward the sound. A woman was struggling, being robbed her voice strained, her face contorted in fear. The man paused only a moment before continuing down the street, unaffected.

Eventually, he reached the cemetery at the city’s edge. There, a lone caretaker was lowering a coffin into a freshly dug grave. The man watched from a distance as the caretaker strained with the pulley system. Tears streamed down his face, falling like rain onto the polished wood. Then suddenly, the cord slipped both the coffin and the caretaker fell into the grave.

The man turned away.

He crossed the street just as a car sped toward the intersection. The driver, eyes glued to his phone, looked up at the last second just in time to swerve. He missed the man... but crashed into a coffee shop at the corner. Shattered glass, screams, and dust filled the air.

Still, the man didn’t flinch.

Behind him, chaos and cries echoed through the streets.

At the end of the block, he saw a child kneeling beside a motionless woman on the sidewalk her mother. The child sobbed, clinging to her still hand. The man walked past without slowing.

Further on, a police officer was caught in the middle of a heated conflict between two groups. Tension cracked someone pulled a gun. A shot rang out. The officer was hit in the throat. He fell, gasping, blood pouring from between his fingers.

People scattered in panic, leaving the officer alone.

The man passed by. Their eyes met briefly. In the officer’s final breath, all he saw in the stranger’s face was emptiness.

Sirens screamed behind him as he reached the steps of his apartment. Police cruisers sped past, lights flashing.

He opened the door and stepped inside.

And there hanging from the ceiling  a man.

Familiar. Lifeless.

The man stared in silence.

His eyes drifted to the end table.

There lay a note, written in uneven ink:

“What is wrong with life?”

1mle6wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mle6wv/i_cant_tell_my_bf_that_my_first_love_was_a_girl/,"I can't tell my bf that my first love was a girl, and that she still impacts me to this day.","I'm currently with my boyfriend who I love with my whole heart. I've never loved anyone more than him. I want to spend my life with him, we've dedicated almost two years to eachother. We're open with eachother about everything, but I feel awful for holding this from him. Would there serve a purpose in bringing this to his attention? No idea. All I know is I feel immense guilt for not telling him about it, and that I most likely never will.

Almost seven years ago, I met a girl in school who I firmly believe was my first love. I became so infatuated with her. She showed me what love was, what romance, and deep passion for someone was. She never was interested in me, she didn't like girls. But by gosh I was fawning over her. She delicately placed color in my world, color I hadn't felt or seen. I was so infatuated with her softness, with how she was 110% of herself at all times no matter who was looking, I fell in love with her thought process, how delicate she was, her growth, I fell madly in love with this girl and she was all I could think about, for years. 

After we changed schools and lost touch during covid, I seeked every avenue to try and get over her but nothing worked. I wrote her 3 letters that she never read, that sit in my google docs to this day, detailing how I fell for her and respected her and that what she taught me I will take with me until the end of my time. This girl taught me one of the most valuable lessons of my life, and she taught me the rich value of authenticity. She showed me how much I loved authenticity in people and who they are, how much I valued when someone was just purely themself. When someone was so intellectually and emotionally congruent with themself and who they were, that they never change because of the crowd but only for their own growth. To this day that is the number one characteristic I look for in partners, authenticity, and just being who you are. She set the precedent for the entirety of my future romantic life and she has no idea. 

For four years after we lost touch, I could not get her or her influence out of my head. I dated three people within those four years and the whole time I would still secretly stalk her socials. I would day dream about me stumbling upon her as an adult. I would day dream about the silliest of things, like stumbling upon her struggling carrying groceries to her car and then helping her and we end up catching up. Or finding her in public and giving her a ride somewhere, or catching up over coffee. She lived in my mind and occupied my heart for the longest time. 
Within the last couple years I've lost the burning passion I had for her in my heart. She still holds such a special place in my life and she will never know it, I know that anytime I think about her in the future it will be oh so fondly. I will always have some extent of care for her no matter where I'm at in life even if my romantic feelings for her do not exist anymore. But somewhere deep down, I fear that she still has more of a hold on my heart than I think. 

A month ago or so, I was playing online with my boyfriend and I found a friend request from her on one of my socials. It's been six years since I last saw her, and she friended me. I was so taken aback, the fondness, the anxiety, all of it came back in an instant. When my boyfriend asked me what was wrong, I just stayed silent trying to articulate an answer, and told him it wasn't a big deal. I left it at that, and over the course of the evening those feelings and butterflies faded.


My boyfriend is the one for me. I love him, I'm going to marry him. He has my heart, and I would choose him in an instant no matter who I had to choose between even if this girl came back into my life. But deep down I am so terrified of actually stumbling upon her again someday. I'm terrified of everything coming back. I'm terrified of her sparking the same light in my life that she did back then, I'm terrified of her captivating me so effortlessly and me having to deal with the emotional turmoil of knowing that I am feeling something for another when I absolutely shouldn't be. I don't want her to have this hold over me, and I won't let her. But I'm afraid this fondness will never die, and I never want it to grow into something more again. 

My boyfriend doesn't know that I had feelings for a girl. I've never told him and I'm terrified of that conversation. Not for fear that he will reject me, but fear of what it would bring to the relationship and how I would have to reassure him (rightfully so). I don't want to have to explain to him the trauma I went through growing up liking girls. I don't want to have to explain to him that I don't have secret feelings for girls now, nor do I have secret feelings for other men. I don't want to have to explain why I never identified myself as bisexual or something of the sort, such label isn't needed anymore, atleast for me personally. 

I love him so much. He is my life and I want to tend to him with the most gentle touch and love. Maybe someday, time will call for us to have this conversation. But it kills me having this fondness for a girl he knows nothing about. It kills me just knowing that I've hidden this major past love from him. Maybe this isn't actually all that big of a deal. Maybe he deserves to know. Or maybe I am okay in my reservations with this topic and I'm overthinking it. 
But all I know is I'm scared this girl will enchant me again someday like she once did, and deeper, undead fondness and passion for her will rise again. I still have hundreds of ties to everyone she and I surrounded ourselves with. Who knows how this will go.


EDIT: When she sent me the friend request I did not accept it. I was just stating the shock and anxiety the situation drummed up.",2,1754706442.0,offmychest,7,1.0,False

Some advanced models include built-in charging ports or wireless charging pads for added convenience.**Size and dimensions**

Ottoman size is a critical factor, with models ranging from small, individual units to larger, rectangular designs suitable for multiple users. Dimensions typically vary from 18 inches to 48 inches in width and 16 inches to 24 inches in height.

1mle534,https://youtu.be/jP812Y0bt60,3 Very Scary TRUE Abandoned Texas Ranch Horror Stories,"# ""The Last Toll of the Bell: Tragedy at Poki Roni Ranch"":

It was spring 2005 when I first walked onto Poki Roni Ranch, and I had just moved to El Paso, Texas, looking for a fresh start. A friend told me about a job at a horse ranch that doubled as a petting zoo. It sounded like a dream for someone like me who loved animals. When I arrived, the place felt like it belonged in a storybook. Old adobe buildings stood strong, a tall bell tower watched over the land, and horses grazed peacefully in the fields. Chickens clucked, ducks waddled, and a peacock strutted around like it owned the place. Kids laughed as they rode ponies, and parents snapped photos. It was a slice of paradise.

Patricia Kirchner, the owner, greeted me with a smile that could warm anyone’s heart. She was in her 70s but moved with the energy of someone half her age. Her love for horses was clear in every word she spoke. Her son, Travis, was there too, a quiet man in his 50s who seemed to live for the ranch. They were a team, keeping this historic place alive despite the noisy Lee Trevino Drive that now ran right past it. Patricia told me the ranch had been in their family since 1929 and might even have been the site of a Spanish mission from the 1700s. They’d found a brass bell buried on the property, dated 1779, which now hung in the bell tower.

I got the job as a stable hand and quickly fell in love with the work. Feeding the horses, cleaning the stables, leading pony rides for kids’ birthday parties—it was perfect. Patricia treated me like family, sharing stories about the ranch’s past over cups of coffee. Travis was quieter, but he’d help with the horses and offer tips when I needed them. For three years, life at Poki Roni was everything I’d hoped for.

But then came that morning in September 2008. I arrived at the ranch as usual, but something was wrong. The place was too quiet. No animals made their usual noises, and no one was around. My stomach twisted as I walked toward the main house and saw police cars and an ambulance parked outside. My heart started racing. I ran up to an officer and asked what happened.

“Patricia’s been found dead,” he said, his voice flat. “Carbon monoxide poisoning in the garage. Looks like a suicide.”

I froze. Suicide? Patricia? It didn’t make sense. She loved life, loved this ranch, loved every animal here. The idea that she’d take her own life felt like a punch to the gut. I stood there, trying to process it, as the officer told me to go home. The ranch was closed until further notice.

The next few days were a haze. I couldn’t stop thinking about Patricia—her smile, her stories, her kindness. It was like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. Then, whispers started spreading around town. People said Travis had been acting strange before her death. Some even suggested he might have had something to do with it. I didn’t want to believe it. Travis was her son. He loved her. Didn’t he?

A few days before her death, I’d overheard them arguing. I was finishing up my work when I heard raised voices coming from the main house. I didn’t mean to listen, but I couldn’t help it. Travis was talking about money, saying the ranch wasn’t making enough and they should sell it. “Mom, we’re barely breaking even,” he said, his voice sharp. “With all this development around us, property values are going up. We could sell and live comfortably.”

Patricia’s voice was firm, almost angry. “This ranch has been in our family for generations. I’m not selling it, Travis. We’ll find another way.”

The conversation ended abruptly, and I walked away, feeling uneasy. At the time, I thought it was just a family disagreement. Now, it felt like a warning I should’ve heeded.

There were other signs, too, that I didn’t notice at the time. Travis had been spending a lot of time in the garage, saying he was fixing things. He’d bought a new generator a week before, claiming it was for power outages, but we rarely had those. And the night before Patricia’s death, I was leaving late after helping with a birthday party. As I drove away, I saw a light on in the garage, which was odd because we always turned off all lights at night to save energy. I mentioned it to Travis the next day, and he said he hadn’t been in there. I didn’t think much of it then, but now it haunts me.

A week after Patricia’s death, the police called me in for questioning. My hands shook as I drove to the station. The detective asked about Travis’s behavior in the weeks leading up to the incident. I told them about his time in the garage, the argument I’d overheard, and how he’d seemed more withdrawn than usual. Then the detective dropped a bombshell: Travis had confessed. He said it was a suicide pact gone wrong—that they had planned to die together, but he couldn’t go through with it. He left Patricia in the car with the engine running, connected to the generator, and went back to the house.

I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. A suicide pact? Patricia never seemed like someone who would want to die. And Travis… how could he leave her like that? The thought made me sick. The idea that he could plan something so horrific, right under our noses, while we worked and laughed together, was terrifying.

The trial was a media circus. The courtroom was packed with people from El Paso, all wanting to hear the details of this tragic story. I had to testify, recounting everything I could remember about those last few weeks. The prosecution showed a video Travis had made, where he calmly described the so-called pact. He spoke about how they had planned it together, but at the last minute, he couldn’t bring himself to die. He left her alone in the garage, knowing what would happen.

But the prosecution didn’t believe him. They said there was no evidence of a pact, that Patricia had no intention of dying. They argued that Travis had set it all up to make it look like a suicide, maybe for money or control of the ranch. They presented evidence that the generator had been deliberately rigged to fill the garage with deadly fumes while Patricia slept in her car. The jury agreed, and Travis was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to 29 years in prison.

Sitting in that courtroom, watching Travis on the stand, I felt a mix of anger and sorrow. Anger at what he’d done, sorrow for Patricia, who deserved so much better. He looked broken, but whether it was from guilt or from losing his mother, I couldn’t tell.

After the trial, I tried to move on, but the memory of Poki Roni Ranch haunted me. I couldn’t bring myself to work with horses again; it reminded me too much of Patricia and the betrayal she suffered. In 2014, I heard that Travis had died in prison, found hanged in his cell. It was a tragic end to an already tragic story.

The ranch was sold shortly after Patricia’s death. The new owners turned it into something else—maybe a storage facility, I’m not sure. The animals are gone, the laughter of children silenced. All that’s left is the bell tower, standing tall like a silent witness to everything that happened.

Sometimes, I drive by the old place. It looks different now—quieter, emptier. But there’s something about it that feels… wrong. Like the land itself remembers the darkness that unfolded there. Late at night, when I’m driving home, I swear I can hear the faint sound of that old brass bell tolling, as if it’s mourning the loss of the woman who loved this place more than anything.

I still think about Patricia, her kindness, her stories. And I wonder if she knew what was coming, if there were signs I missed. Did she sense the danger in her own son? Could I have done something to stop it? Those questions keep me up at night. The ranch was supposed to be a place of joy, but now it’s just a shadow of what it once was—a reminder that even in the most beautiful places, evil can hide.





# ""The Pig in the Nightgown"":

I stood at the edge of the overgrown field, staring at the dilapidated farmhouse in the distance. The morning light made the broken windows and sagging roof look even more ominous. It was supposed to be a simple job: clear out the place so it could be demolished. But as I took in the crumbling structure, a sense of unease settled in my stomach. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this place was hiding something—something wrong.

There were four of us: me, Jake, Carlos, and our foreman, Bill. We’d done jobs like this before, clearing out abandoned properties, but this one felt different from the start. The farmhouse was isolated, sitting at the end of a long, dirt road that wound through fields choked with weeds. No neighbors, no passing cars—just silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of the wind through the tall grass.

“Let’s get this over with,” Bill said, clapping his hands together. He was always the practical one, focused on the task at hand. “The sooner we finish, the sooner we get paid.”

We grabbed our tools and made our way to the house. The front door was already half-open, hanging crookedly on its hinges. Inside, the air was thick with dust and the smell of rot. The living room was cluttered with old furniture—a sagging couch, a broken table, and a few chairs covered in grime. Yellowed curtains hung limply over the windows, barely moving in the stale air.

As we started sorting through the junk, I noticed something odd. Among the dust and cobwebs, there were signs of recent activity: a half-empty water bottle on the floor, a crumpled fast-food wrapper on the windowsill. I picked up the wrapper and frowned. It wasn’t old—it looked like it had been dropped there recently.

“Bill,” I called out, holding it up. “Someone’s been here.”

He glanced over, his expression tightening. “Probably just squatters. Let’s keep moving.”

We worked in uneasy silence, the only sounds our footsteps creaking on the old floorboards and the occasional clatter of furniture being moved. In the kitchen, we found more evidence of recent use: a table set with plates and utensils, as if someone had just finished a meal. A half-eaten sandwich sat on one of the plates, the bread curling at the edges but still fresh.

“This is weird,” Jake said, picking up the sandwich and sniffing it. “This isn’t even that old.”

Carlos, who had been quiet until now, shifted uncomfortably. “Maybe we should call the police.”

Bill shook his head. “We’re getting paid to clear this place out, not to investigate. Let’s just finish the job.”

We moved upstairs, where the air felt even heavier, the dust thicker. In one of the bedrooms, we found a mattress on the floor, its sheets rumpled as if someone had just gotten up. Clothes were strewn across the floor, and a small pile of personal items—a comb, a pocketknife, a stack of old photographs—sat on the dresser.

“This doesn’t feel right,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “We should leave.”

Bill sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Look, I get it. It’s creepy. But we’re almost done. Let’s just finish up and get out of here.”

Reluctantly, we continued. But as we were loading some of the furniture onto the truck, Carlos called out from the backyard. “Guys, you need to see this.”

We followed him outside, stepping into the overgrown yard. That’s when we saw it: a pig, tied to a post near the barn. But it wasn’t just any pig. It was wearing a woman’s nightgown, the fabric stained and tattered, and a bra was strapped awkwardly around its body. The pig stood there, snorting softly, its beady eyes watching us.

For a moment, no one spoke. We just stared, trying to make sense of what we were seeing.

“What in the world?” Jake finally said, his voice breaking the silence.

I felt a chill run through me. This wasn’t just a squatter; this was someone deeply disturbed. Someone who didn’t think like the rest of us.

“Let’s get out of here,” I said, my voice trembling. “This isn’t worth it.”

Bill hesitated, glancing back at the house. “We’re almost done. Let’s just finish loading the truck.”

But I could see the doubt in his eyes. He felt it too—the wrongness of this place.

We decided to check the barn next, thinking there might be more animals or valuable items inside. The barn was dark and musty, with shafts of light piercing through the gaps in the walls. The smell hit us first—a pungent mix of hay, manure, and something else, something metallic, like blood.

We found more signs of recent habitation: a camping stove, a cot, and a stack of canned food. But what really disturbed us were the cages in the corner. There were several of them, most empty, but one contained the remains of a small animal—perhaps a rabbit or a cat—that had clearly been dead for some time.

“This is sick,” Carlos said, his voice trembling.

We were about to leave when Jake noticed a door at the back of the barn, partially hidden by old farming equipment. “What’s that?” he asked, pointing.

Curiosity got the better of us, and we approached the door. It was locked, but the padlock was rusty and easy to break. Inside, we found a small room that looked like it had been converted into a workshop. There were tools—hammers, saws, and knives—laid out on a table, along with jars filled with what looked like preserved body parts: eyes, fingers, and other unidentifiable organs.

I felt bile rise in my throat. “We need to get out of here now,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

But before we could move, we heard the same grunt we’d heard earlier, only this time it was louder, closer. We turned to see the pig, somehow free from its post, standing in the doorway of the barn, staring at us with its beady eyes.

Then, from behind us, a voice: “You shouldn’t have come here.”

We spun around to see a man standing in the shadows, tall and gaunt, with wild, unkempt hair and a beard that reached his chest. His clothes were filthy, stained with dirt and what looked like blood. In his hand, he held an axe.

We didn’t think; we just ran. Out of the barn, past the pig, and straight to the truck. Bill fumbled with the keys, his hands shaking, but finally got it started. As we peeled out of the driveway, I looked back and saw the man step out of the barn, watching us with a calm, almost amused expression.

We didn’t stop until we were back in town, all of us breathing heavily, our hands shaking.

“I’m never going back there,” Carlos said, his voice shaky.

“None of us are,” Bill replied, gripping the steering wheel tightly.

That was the last time any of us set foot on that property. I don’t know what happened to the man or what he was doing there, but I’ve often wondered if anyone else ever found that place—and what they might have discovered.

One thing I know for sure: some jobs aren’t worth the money, and some secrets are better left buried.





# ""No One Leaves"":

I’ll never forget the day I set foot on that ranch. It was supposed to be just another job—a place to earn a few bucks while I figured out my next move. But it turned into something out of a nightmare, a place where fear lived in every shadow and every sound.

I’d been drifting for months, hopping from one odd job to another, when I heard about a ranch near Mountain Home that needed hands. They were paying well for simple work—cutting cedar and making keychains—so I figured it was worth checking out. The ranch was huge, 3,500 acres of rugged hill country, miles from anywhere. When I arrived, the main house stood there, old and weathered, with a porch that creaked under my boots as I walked up.

A man stepped out before I could knock. He was middle-aged, with a face like leather and eyes that didn’t seem to blink. “You the new guy?” he asked, his voice rough like gravel.

“Yeah,” I said, trying to sound confident. “Name’s Jake.”

He didn’t offer his hand, just nodded. “Walter Ellebracht. You’ll do fine if you work hard.” He turned and led me inside.

The house smelled of cedar and something else—something sharp, like metal. Inside, there were a few others: a younger man who looked like Walter’s son and a woman with cold, hard eyes. They didn’t speak, just watched me like I was some kind of animal they were sizing up.

Walter explained the work—cutting cedar, shaping it into keychains, packaging them for sale. It sounded easy enough, and the pay was better than anything I’d seen in a while, so I agreed to stay. That first night, I was shown to a bunkhouse with a few other workers. They were a quiet bunch, all drifters like me, but they didn’t talk much. When I tried to strike up a conversation, they just gave me short answers and turned away. I figured they were tired from the day’s work, so I didn’t push it.

The next morning, we started early. The work was hard but not unbearable—chopping cedar all day. Walter was always watching, always criticizing. If someone messed up, he’d yell or worse. I saw him slap one of the guys for dropping a load of wood. After that, I kept my head down and worked as fast as I could.

As the days went by, I started noticing things that didn’t sit right. The workers were always on edge, jumping at every sound. At night, I’d hear whispers in the bunkhouse—sometimes sobs—but when I asked what was wrong, they’d just shake their heads and say nothing. One night, I woke up to a sound that made my skin crawl: screaming. It was faint, coming from the direction of the main house. I sat up, heart racing, but no one else stirred. Maybe they were used to it, or maybe they were too scared to react. I lay back down, telling myself it was probably just an animal or something. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

A few days later, a new guy showed up. His name was Anthony, and he had a patch over one eye. He was friendly, always joking around, trying to lighten the mood. But I could see the fear in his eyes too, especially when Walter was around.

One afternoon, while we were working, Anthony was using the chainsaw to cut some cedar. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, and he cried out in pain. He’d gashed his leg badly. Blood was pouring out, and he was writhing on the ground.

Walter and his son came running over. Instead of helping him, they just stood there, looking down at him with disgust. “You’re no use to us like this,” Walter said coldly.

They dragged Anthony back to the house, and I didn’t see him for the rest of the day. That night, the screaming started again—louder this time. It went on for hours, and I couldn’t sleep. The other workers just covered their ears and tried to ignore it.

The next morning, Anthony was back at work, but he was different. His face was pale, and he moved slowly, wincing with every step. When I asked him what happened, he just shook his head and said, “Don’t ask.”

I didn’t press him, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was going on. Then, one day, while I was working alone in the woods, I found something buried under some leaves—a set of chains, rusty and old. I picked them up, wondering why they were there.

That night, I confronted one of the workers about it. His name was Tom, and he’d been there longer than most. “What are these for?” I asked, showing him the chains.

His face went white. “Put those back where you found them,” he hissed. “If Walter sees you with those, you’re done for.”

“Done for? What do you mean?” I asked.

He looked around nervously. “Just forget you saw them. And don’t ask any more questions.”

But I couldn’t let it go. That night, after everyone was asleep, I snuck out and followed the path to the main house. I heard voices coming from the basement.

I crept closer, peeking through a window. What I saw made my blood run cold. Anthony was there, chained to a wall, his body covered in wounds. Walter and his son were torturing him with a cattle prod, laughing as he screamed.

I wanted to run in and save him, but I knew I couldn’t take them on alone. So, I did the only thing I could—I ran back to the bunkhouse and packed my things. I was going to leave that night, get as far away as possible.

But as I was about to sneak out, Walter caught me. “Where do you think you’re going?” he asked, his voice like ice.

“I’m leaving,” I said, trying to sound brave.

He just laughed. “No one leaves here without my say-so.”

Before I could react, he hit me, hard. Everything went black.

When I woke up, I was tied to a chair in the basement. Walter was standing over me, holding the cattle prod. “You should have minded your own business,” he said.

Then, the pain began. They shocked me, beat me, until I thought I was going to die. But somehow, I held on.

Hours later—or maybe it was days—I heard sirens in the distance. The police had finally come.

Walter and his family tried to run, but they were caught. The workers who had participated in the torture were arrested too.

I was taken to the hospital, broken but alive. Later, I found out that Tom had managed to escape and alert the authorities.

The ranch was shut down, and justice was served, but for me, the horror will never end.",1,1754706301.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I don’t think he did this on purpose, not that Astro Corp will care. Fines will be handed out and punishments given for this slip up. . . simply how it is out here on the rim. . .“

Mmmmhh” that's strange. . . in Hal's logs it states he had started an emergency quantum message to Astro Corp for rescue. . . But his logs end when he shuts down and the station is struck and destroyed but the connection stays connected after the collision according to Astro Corps log’s infact it had stayed connected for many days after the Antimatter collision. . . and it dosen’t move so hal didn’t go rouge and evac the station to take over besides the logs even state that wasn’t something he had ever even planned to do. If the station was obliterated how was the quantum link stable even after the collision?

“I know it sounds far fetched Samantha, But I genuinely think there is more to this. . . I just can’t see how the Quantum Relay stayed connected for DAYS after the collision. . . And what wreckage was found, the relay wasn’t there!” I pleaded to Samantha. . . This back and forth has been happening for a while now. . .

“I just don’t believe it… Faster than light travel is not feasible and any other alternative would’ve been found, . . . If anti-matter does teleport people wouldn't we have found that out? Make it make since, it has been thousands of years since Light travel was created and going past it just doesn't work, THOUSANDS of years to develop an alternative it just would’ve been found by now….” Samantha claims. I see her reasoning but . . .

“Perhaps something else must have happened, maybe some chemicals on board or something! I think Hal is still out there. . . And if he did teleport perhaps it can be recreated. . . The quantum relay worked. . . we just need to test it!”  Perhaps if we test it. . . and if it works. . .” I plead with Samantha…

“Thats. . . not a bad idea, we could try and recreate it. . . but we don’t have the funds for that” she states while putting her hand to her chin. . .The funds… I think I know a specific organization that has the funds. . .

“Astro Corp does. . .” I state plainly

“That is a terrible Idea. . . How would you even convince them to do something like that, huh? She states. . .

Chuckling I state “I think I might have just the plan for that. . . We simply make this public! As loud as possible. . . but we’d need more evidence and for that we could start small with these experiments, and that will be less expensive, And for those funds I think I know a guy.”

“That might work, the public out cry might just be enough to be able to force their hands. . . and if they refuse there are plenty of other mega corps willing to take us in. . . perhaps this isn’t the best plan. What if they forcefully take us in…?” she states as she folds her arms to her chest, I might know just the solution to that.

“That’s easy, if we make it public slap our faces on it then what would they be able to do, plus that guy. . . I think he’d be able to store our information we gather, so if we do get captured then they wouldn’t get the information they'd want from us of course there should be more planning to counter this but that can be worked out later of course.”

“Just who is this guy you keep talking about” she says right as the waitress arrives with our orders, Space bacon and eggs, and lovely lovely coffee!

“Sorry for the wait you two, new employees causing issues in the back, would yall like a discount on the meal because of the inconveniences? The waitress states. . . her nameplate is embroiled with the name Marissa on it.“

Oh thank you, I hope everything is okay back there!” Samantha says with a worried expression plastered on her face.

“Ahh food finally!” I announce!

Finally chapter 2! I got a bit distracted but I got this done within my self imposed time limit, Hope yall enjoyed!A brand new world for Hal to explore and cloaks n daggers with mega corps back in the old world. Fun! also sorry if it's a bit short, I promise they will hopefully be getting longer! This is my first time ever writing so pacing is kinda hard.",4,1754706255.0,HFY,5,1.0,False
