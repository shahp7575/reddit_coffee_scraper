1l3m3gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hitchhiking/comments/1l3m3gu/had_a_rough_day/,Had a rough day.,"Hey, just found this sub and as I'm stuck in my tent, under a storm (at least im dry and have reception), in the middle of a forest in Canada, I felt like sharing my day. I'm sunburnt from 8h of hitchikking in the sun and I moved less than 50km from yesterday's campsite. This is just me sharing a slice of life, so if you too have time to waste and like those stories... otherwise there's a TLDR with like questions from someone coming back from a long break.

So about me, Im 35M, French. I've hitchhiked quite a bit around Australia, NZ, SE Asia and France (Over 20k km over the years i'd say) but that was over 10 years ago. Haven't done it in a long time as I had settled for a few years then covid happened but I got itchy for the road and started a 2 year backpacking trip in Canada last year.

I started in Montreal and my goal is Winnipeg. I figured it was an easy trip, pretty much a straight line across Canada. I did the whole Cairns>Adelaide in 2014 across the desert so it seemed easy in comparison. Oh I was wrong.

Getting out of the city yesterday was quite convenient, public transport got me 200km out of the city for like $6 and I got dropped by the bus at a perfect spot. Sure enough after 20mn I get picked up by a nice hippie lady and she asked me to sing for her which was funny because I'm the worse singer ever. She appreciated that I tried.
It was getting quite late so she dropped me off near the road after 100km and I spent the night in the forest in what I assume was a maple syrup farm because there was tubing everywhere like a giant spiderweb. Kind of weird in the middle of a random forest like this.

Which bring us to today. Its 9am, next to a perfect spot with tons of cars passing by. I'm 350k from Montreal so it's remote but still busy with lovely little towns along the highway. 1hour, nothing. Wierd. 
Maybe I started too early, its mostly working people in shiny SUVs with one dude at the wheel, maybe they don't have time for this nonsense. 2 hours. It's getting hot, no shade near the road. I'm taking off my jacket, knowing I'll regret it but i'm going through my water from yesterday too fast and I'm on my last bottle. 3 hours. Mostly still shiny SUVs with the occasional shitty Hunday which get my hopes up every time (In my experience, the shittier the car, the better the odds and the pick-ups trucks, despite the name, never pick you up). 4 hours, finally someone stops! 

A very nice old man tells me he's just going to the nearest town 15 kilometers down the highway but that he can drop me at the gas station outside of town. I gladly accept and we get there in 10mm. I get a coffee, some food, fill up my water and grab some cardboard to make a sign (always keep a sharpie on you!) before trying my luck again.
1 hour, 2 hours. A shitty Hunday stops for me (They really are the best) but the guy is just going back from work to the next town over, 40k down the road. Well I'm not about to say no to a ride. He's super nice, we both work construction so we have plenty to talk about. He drop me at a gas station truckstop outside of town. 

It's 3pm, plenty of daylight left, lets get back to it. Traffic slowed down, there's not as many cars but still like 10 a minute on average so that's pretty good but no joy.
It's now 5pm and i feel my neck burning. My arms are red as well. 
The wind is picking up, big dark clouds are coming in fast. I check my weather app. Sure enough its going to be a storm. I head to the forest behind the gas station and pitch my tent as fast as I can while battling the local equivalent for sandflies. Perfect timing, its done as soon as the first drops hit my head. Gear inside. Wow what a shitty day.


TLDR: So how's hitchikking in Canada in 2025? Anyone did the trans canada Highway recently? It's my second day after a 10 year break and I really feel hopeless. I did 3 bunny hops in 2 days despite ideal conditions (lots of cars but not too many, convenient spots etc...). So many people passing me by with dead eyes or suddently looking at that tree on the other side of the road. 
I'm really wondering if it's really still a thing today or if it is another casualty of post covid world and people are just too apathic for that anymore. 

It sure feels different to be backpacking in 2025 here in Canada. I don't know if it's me getting older, people losing hope, the economy going down the drain but ever since I arrived it felt wrong. Both the normal tourist experience and the low budget backpacking way. 
Anway, kinda down and stuck in a tent rn so if you have similar/opposite experiences i'd love to know. Especially if it's recent and in Canada because another day like this and I will consider going back and just take the plane but it would be so sad.

That's when she discovered she was nothing but a switched-at-birth fraud.  
  
Humiliated, she packed her bags to leave. But on her last night in the mansion, Kaiden Sheridan carried her to his car.  
  
The brother who'd been cold and distant her whole life pressed her against the leather seats and made her come three times.  
  
Her voice was raw from crying out when he gripped her waist, whispering over and over in her ear: ""I've wanted to fuck you for so damn long.""  
  
In that moment, she finally understood—all those years of coldness had been nothing but self-control.  
  
Soon after, he announced their engagement. No one could talk him out of it.  
  
When their parents objected, he stripped them of power and took complete control of the Sheridan empire.  
  
When the real daughter threw her tantrums, he cut off all her credit cards and threatened to ship her back to whatever trailer park she came from.  
  
Brooklyn couldn't accept being with the brother she'd grown up with. She tried to run countless times, but he always dragged her back.  
  
He had her completely trapped—nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.  
  
Until two weeks ago, when he crashed his Porsche racing through downtown at midnight to get her favorite cheesecake from that 24-hour bakery.  
  
When he woke up... he remembered nothing.  
  
The Sheridan family was overjoyed. When they introduced Brooklyn, they didn't mention she was the woman he'd obsessed over—they simply called her the nanny.  
  
Now they wanted her gone while Kaiden's memory was wiped clean.  
  
""This is a hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan shoved the check across the mahogany table. ""Kaiden doesn't remember you exist right now. Take this money and disappear. We raised you for twenty years—consider this our final favor. Never show your face around him again, and make damn sure he never finds you.""  
  
After what felt like forever, Brooklyn finally spoke.  
  
""Fine. I'll have all my immigration paperwork done within two weeks. I'll never come back to the States.""  
  
She picked up the check, her hands trembling slightly. This whole year felt like some twisted nightmare.  
  
They wanted her gone. And honestly? She wanted to leave too.  
  
Sure, Kaiden had spoiled her rotten this past year—designer clothes, jewelry worth more than most people's houses, vacations to private islands. But this kind of possessive, stolen love was suffocating her.  
  
He never gave me a choice, she thought bitterly. Just took what he wanted, like everything else.  
  
With his amnesia, this was her only shot at freedom.  
  
""What the hell is going on here?""  
  
The front door slammed open. Kaiden stood in the entryway with Alina Sheridan trailing behind him.  
  
He looked every inch the billionaire CEO—tailored Tom Ford suit, perfectly styled dark hair, that commanding presence that made board rooms go silent. Even now, with no memory of who she was, he still made her heart race.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan's faces went white. They plastered on fake smiles. ""Oh, nothing at all! Just going over some household stuff with the nanny.""  
  
Mrs. Sheridan elbowed her husband. ""We were just heading upstairs for our afternoon nap.""  
  
Before leaving, she shot Brooklyn a look that could kill—keep your mouth shut.  
  
Brooklyn stared at the floor, clutching the check so hard her knuckles went white. She started toward the servants' staircase when—  
  
""Stop.""  
  
Kaiden's voice could freeze hell over.  
  
She froze mid-step, not daring to look up. Her heart was hammering so loud she was sure he could hear it.  
  
His Italian leather shoes clicked against the marble as he approached. Then his fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes—those same dark eyes that used to look at her like she was his entire world.  
  
God, he's still so beautiful, she thought helplessly. Even now, when he looks at me like I'm nothing.  
  
Her breathing hitched as memories flooded back—him pressing her against the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse office, bending her over his desk after board meetings, taking her on the hood of his car in their private garage.  
  
His thumb traced her jawline, those familiar calluses sending shivers down her spine. ""What's that perfume you're wearing?""  
  
Brooklyn opened her mouth to answer—  
  
""Don't wear it again."" He dropped his hand like she'd burned him. ""Nannies should stick to changing diapers and making bottles. Don't try to seduce anyone in this house.""  
  
Her chest tightened painfully.  
  
Before, he used to bury his face in my neck and breathe me in like I was oxygen. 'You smell incredible, baby,' he'd whisper. 'Like vanilla and something that's just... you. Drives me fucking crazy.'  
  
'I'm not wearing any perfume,' I'd tell him.  
  
'Then it's just you. Every part of you was made for me, Brooklyn. You're never leaving me. I'll hunt you down wherever you go.'  
  
She'd believed him then. Thought she'd never escape.  
  
But now he doesn't even remember my name.  
  
Brooklyn swallowed the lump in her throat. ""Understood, Mr. Sheridan.""  
  
She watched him disappear into his study, then finally let herself breathe. She was turning to go pack when Alina suddenly appeared and slapped her across the face so hard her ears rang.  
  
""You pathetic little bitch!"" Alina shrieked. ""Even with my brother's memory completely gone, you're still trying to sink your claws into him!""  
  
Jesus, that hurt. Brooklyn's cheek burned, but she didn't touch it. Wouldn't give Alina the satisfaction.  
  
""Well, guess what, trailer trash? My brother's got a real fiancée now!"" Alina's smile was vicious. ""The engagement announcement's going out next week. Some sophisticated woman from a proper family—not some charity case who doesn't know her real daddy.""  
  
Brooklyn's stomach dropped.  
  
A fiancée. Of course. He's Kaiden fucking Sheridan—heir to a billion-dollar empire. Of course they'd line up suitable wives the second he was available again.  
  
Not that it matters. I'm leaving anyway.  
  
But Alina wasn't done. ""Guards! Grab this slut! Throw her in the cold storage! Let her freeze her ass off and think about what happens when you try to seduce my brother!""  
  
The bodyguards looked at each other nervously. Nobody moved.  
  
They all remembered what happened to the last guy who'd touched Brooklyn—some senator's son at a charity gala. He'd grabbed her waist for a photo. The next morning, his hand was delivered to his father's office in a Tiffany box.  
  
Alina's face turned red. ""My brother has amnesia! She's just the fucking nanny now! What are you scared of?!""  
  
She pointed at the head of security. ""If you don't arrest her right now, I'll have you all fired!""  
  
The guards still hesitated.  
  
Then the study door flew open.  
  
Kaiden stepped out, his jaw tight with irritation. ""What's all this screaming about?""  
  
Alina immediately switched to her sweet little sister act. ""Oh, Kaiden! The nanny was being completely inappropriate, so I wanted to discipline her. But these guards won't listen to me!""  
  
Kaiden's cold gaze swept over the security team. ""What did she pay you? Since when do you ignore direct orders from family?""  
  
He looked at Brooklyn with pure disgust. ""Get her out of my sight. She's making me sick.""  
  
The study door slammed shut.  
  
He used to warm my feet against his chest when I got cold at night. Now he's sending me to freeze.  
  
With Kaiden's permission, the guards had no choice.  
  
Brooklyn closed her eyes as they dragged her toward the basement. She'd always been sensitive to cold—that's why Kaiden used to keep the mansion at exactly 75 degrees year-round.  
  
'Can't have my baby getting cold,' he'd say, pulling me closer.  
  
Now he doesn't give a damn if I freeze to death.  
  
The cold storage was brutal—probably 20 degrees below zero. Brooklyn curled up in the corner, her thin cotton dress doing nothing against the bitter cold.  
  
It's fine. Just a few more hours. Then I can pack and get the hell out of here.  
  
I can go back to being Brooklyn Sheridan, not Kaiden Sheridan's obsession.  
  
Maybe I'll go to Europe. Start fresh somewhere he'll never think to look.  
  
Her teeth were chattering violently now. Ice crystals formed on her breath.  
  
God, I'm so tired. So tired of running, of being scared, of loving someone who sees me as property.  
  
Maybe this is how it ends. Maybe I just fall asleep here and never wake up.  
  
Just as consciousness started slipping away, she heard someone screaming her name like the world was ending.  
  
""BROOKLYN!!""  
  
A figure burst through the door, shaking as he gathered her frozen body into his arms.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
When Brooklyn woke up, harsh hospital fluorescents made her squint.  
  
""Brooklyn, how are you feeling? Are you hurt anywhere else?""  
  
A familiar voice drifted to her ears, followed by a concerned face coming into view.  
  
Alistar Roosevelt sat beside her hospital bed, dark circles under his eyes like he'd been keeping vigil all night.  
  
""...Alistar?""  
  
The memories before she'd blacked out came rushing back. She struggled to sit up. ""You're the one who found me?""  
  
Alistar nodded, his voice still shaky. ""I kept calling but you wouldn't pick up. When I got to the Sheridan place, the staff told me you were locked in the freezer...""  
  
He was interrupted when the TV in her room suddenly blared breaking news—  
  
""In a stunning announcement today, Sheridan Industries and Wingston Corp confirmed their merger through marriage. CEO Kaiden Sheridan and heiress Karina Wingston will wed next month in what's being called the wedding of the decade...""  
  
On screen, Kaiden looked every inch the billionaire in his charcoal Armani suit, jaw set like granite, while Karina hung off his arm with a megawatt smile that screamed 'I won.'  
  
Perfect. They look perfect together, Brooklyn thought bitterly. Two beautiful, rich, soulless people.  
  
Alistar quickly grabbed the remote and killed the TV.  
  
The hospital room went dead quiet.  
  
After a few seconds, he took a shaky breath and met her eyes. ""Brooklyn, I know everything that's been happening.""  
  
""You couldn't get away before, but now... Kaiden doesn't remember shit."" His voice was quiet but determined. ""Let me get you out of here. Please.""  
  
Brooklyn stared at her hands. ""Thanks, Alistar, but I'm already getting my papers together to leave for France.""  
  
""The Sheridan family's had people in intelligence and national security for three generations. They can't leave the country without massive government clearance."" She paused. ""Once I'm in Paris, he'll never be able to follow me.""  
  
Never. Because they'll never let him leave, and I'll never come back.  
  
Relief flooded Alistar's face, and he almost grabbed her hand before catching himself. ""That's amazing! I can help you with all the paperwork!""  
  
She pulled back slightly, and he noticed.  
  
""Shit, sorry. I'm just..."" He ran a hand through his hair. ""Really fucking relieved, you know?""  
  
He hesitated, then looked at her with those earnest brown eyes. ""But I need you to know something.""  
  
""How I feel about you. You've gotta know by now, right?""  
  
Brooklyn's chest tightened. She stayed silent.  
  
Of course I know.  
  
From day one of Kaiden's obsession, Alistar had been her only friend. Her only ally.  
  
He'd offered to help her run away countless times, but she knew what Kaiden was capable of better than anyone.  
  
She'd tried escaping dozens of times. Never made it more than a few blocks before his security dragged her back.  
  
One time, some investment banker had bought her a drink at a charity gala—purely innocent. The guy disappeared. Not just from New York. From fucking existence.  
  
Kaiden's reach extended everywhere—FBI contacts, CIA connections, judges, senators. She couldn't escape, and she sure as hell wasn't going to get Alistar killed trying.  
  
So she'd kept him at arm's length, no matter how much it hurt.  
  
She closed her eyes, her hands shaking. ""Alistar, I can't—""  
  
""Hey, no."" He held up his hands. ""I'm not asking you to feel anything right now.""  
  
""I just want you to know..."" He took a deep breath. ""Once you're free, you can actually live again.""  
  
""Do whatever job makes you happy, travel wherever you want, and... maybe fall in love with someone who won't treat you like property.""  
  
His smile was sad but genuine. ""Even if it's not me, I just want you to be happy.""  
  
""I want you to remember what normal feels like. Don't let this year destroy who you really are.""  
  
God, he's too good for this world, Brooklyn thought, tears pricking her eyes. Too good for me.  
  
After a long moment, she whispered, ""Thank you.""  
  
""Once I'm in Paris, I'm going to live like a normal person again."" She looked out at the bright afternoon sun, her voice stronger now. ""See the Louvre, drink wine at sidewalk cafes, maybe even fall in love with some pretentious French artist.""  
  
Someone who doesn't know my name. Someone who'll never know what I've been.  
  
Alistar's whole face lit up. ""Then let me help you get there.""  
  
That afternoon, Alistar drove her to the French consulate and waited while she rushed through her visa application.  
  
""With expedited processing, you should have approval in ten to fourteen days,"" the consular officer said, handing back her passport. ""Bon voyage, mademoiselle.""  
  
Walking out into the Manhattan sunshine, Brooklyn felt something she hadn't experienced in over a year—hope.  
  
Two weeks. Just two more weeks and I'm free.  
  
Alistar drove her back to the Sheridan mansion, chatting about practical stuff the whole way—where she should live in Paris, how to set up a French bank account, whether she'd need a job or if her settlement money would be enough.  
  
""My family's got some business interests in Europe,"" he mentioned casually. ""I might be able to transfer to our London office. You know, just to be in the same time zone if you need anything.""  
  
He's following me to Europe. For me.  
  
Brooklyn's stomach twisted with guilt. ""Alistar, don't uproot your whole life—""  
  
""I'm not,"" he said quickly. ""We've been wanting to expand anyway. It's not just about you.""  
  
Liar. Sweet, wonderful liar.  
  
They pulled up to the mansion's circular driveway. Brooklyn was reaching for the door handle when Alistar suddenly said, ""Wait.""  
  
He leaned over and gently smoothed down a strand of hair that had escaped from her ponytail, his fingers barely grazing her cheek.  
  
So gentle. So different from...  
  
Brooklyn automatically looked up at him, but then her blood turned to ice.  
  
On the mansion's front steps, Kaiden Sheridan stood like a statue, his dark eyes locked on her face with laser focus.  
  
How long has he been watching us?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Kaiden stood there in his perfectly tailored suit, expression cold as steel, that commanding presence radiating from him like a warning.  
  
Brooklyn's fingers trembled. She quickly turned to Alistar. ""You should go.""  
  
Alistar didn't notice anything wrong, still talking. ""When your papers come through, you—""  
  
""Just go!"" Her voice cracked with barely controlled panic. She looked at him desperately. ""Please.""  
  
He blinked, confused, but finally nodded. ""Okay. Be careful.""  
  
Brooklyn waited until his car disappeared down the driveway before turning around. Each step toward the mansion felt like walking to her execution.  
  
Kaiden remained motionless on the steps, watching her with those dark, unreadable eyes.  
  
Jesus, my heart's beating so loud he can probably hear it.  
  
She was shaking all over, terrified of what was coming.  
  
Would he explode? Would he break Alistar's hands like he used to do to any man who so much as looked at her?  
  
But when he finally spoke, his voice was flat and emotionless:  
  
""We have guests. Go prepare the coffee service.""  
  
Then he turned and walked inside, leaving her standing there like an idiot.  
  
That's it? No screaming, no threats, no violence?  
  
She stood frozen for a long moment, hardly daring to breathe.  
  
He really doesn't remember. He really doesn't give a shit about me anymore.  
  
Relief and something that felt suspiciously like heartbreak warred in her chest as she headed to the kitchen.  
  
But when she carried the silver tray with coffee and petit fours into the living room, she stopped dead.  
  
Sitting in the center of the sofa like a queen holding court was Karina Wingston—the woman from the news announcement.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan and Alina were clustered around her, all smiles as they discussed wedding plans in excited voices.  
  
Kaiden sat slightly apart, not participating but listening with polite attention.  
  
They look so fucking happy, Brooklyn thought bitterly. Like Christmas morning.  
  
She kept her head down and approached quietly. ""Your coffee, Miss Wingston.""  
  
Karina looked up with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""Thank you.""  
  
She reached for the delicate china cup, then suddenly ""fumbled"" it—  
  
Scalding coffee splashed across Karina's cream Chanel blouse.  
  
Before Brooklyn could even process what happened, Alina's hand cracked across her face.  
  
""You did that on purpose, didn't you?!""  
  
Brooklyn opened her mouth to explain—""It wasn't me—""  
  
But Alina was already shrieking, turning to Kaiden like a tattletale kid. ""I've been trying to tell you! This nanny has been obsessed with you!""  
  
She pointed at Brooklyn with disgust. ""She steals your stuff, stares at you constantly—she's totally unhinged! Now that she knows you're engaged to Karina, she's gone completely psycho!""  
  
This is insane. They're all insane.  
  
Brooklyn's blood turned to ice. ""I didn't do anything—""  
  
But Karina was already speaking, tears glistening in her perfectly made-up eyes. ""Kaiden, someone in your position will always attract... unstable people. If you don't handle this firmly, others might try the same thing.""  
  
Oh, you manipulative bitch.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Sheridan immediately chimed in: ""Absolutely! She needs to be punished!""  
  
Brooklyn's heart sank as understanding hit her like a freight train.  
  
This was planned. All of it. They set me up.  
  
And Kaiden hated nothing more than women who threw themselves at him.  
  
Sure enough, his voice cut through the room like a blade: ""Take her to the stables. Twenty lashes.""  
  
Without another glance, he scooped Karina into his arms and headed upstairs. ""I'll call my private doctor.""  
  
Twenty lashes. Oh God.  
  
Before Brooklyn could say another word, two security guards grabbed her arms and dragged her outside toward the horse stables behind the mansion.  
  
The night air was freezing against her skin.  
  
Alina followed them out, practically vibrating with excitement as she picked up a leather riding crop from the tack room.  
  
""Finally,"" she breathed, eyes gleaming with malice. ""You're mine now, you pathetic little slut.""  
  
She raised the crop high.  
  
CRACK!  
  
The first blow across Brooklyn's back sent fire through her nerves. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from screaming.  
  
""That's for stealing my life!""  
  
CRACK!  
  
The second strike split through her thin sweater. She could feel warm blood starting to seep through the fabric.  
  
""That's for seducing my brother!""  
  
CRACK!  
  
""And that's for being a worthless piece of trash!""  
  
Don't scream. Don't give her the satisfaction.  
  
But each strike of the crop felt like a branding iron. Blood ran down her back, soaking through her clothes and dripping onto the stable floor.  
  
""Scream!"" Alina shrieked, hitting harder. ""Come on, where's all that attitude now? My brother can't save you anymore!""  
  
Twenty lashes felt like two hundred.  
  
Alina seemed determined to release years of jealousy and rage with each brutal strike. By the end, Brooklyn could barely stay upright.  
  
All she could hear was Alina's vicious laughter and the sharp crack of leather against torn flesh.  
  
When the final blow landed, Brooklyn's knees gave out. She collapsed onto the hay-strewn floor, the world going black around the edges.  
  
Maybe this is how it ends. Maybe I just die here like the animal they think I am.

My wife is a teacher and is off all summer. Shell be spending the time with our 2 year old. I have to work from home 2 days a week for my job. My job is fairly high level and requires me to have important business meetings, but my wife complains that I ruin her whole summer because I have to work from home because she doesn’t like “hearing me talk in meetings”. We live in a typical NY apartment where there’s no where to put a desk but the kitchen/dining space.

i recently downloaded the apps just to give it a shot, figuring i am not looking to anything too serious but having someone to go on dates with and fool around with would be fun, i don’t need a husband but wouldn’t find a friend with benefits turned into something down the line possibly 

anyway, i met this guy a year older than me, and we decided to hand out, it was pretty last minute so we didn’t have a proper date just hate coffee and ended up chatting for hours, and we kissed

fast forward a couple of days and we hung out again, also not a date, but was okay with it because again, not looking for a husband. we didn’t have sex but did everything but which was actually really great and fun

now, the texts were never all that exciting but got even more dull/dry and the reasoning given was being busy/tired which is fair, but no attempt to hang out or even try to maybe set something up has been made whatsoever in over a week, and the texts were SO uninteresting that I didn’t reply on Monday and there has been 0 attempt from him to message me since 

Getting ghosted/shit not working out? part of the game, i get it. but I am writing this sick as a DOG because this man gave me some sort of superflu or coronavirus and I think that it is a sign from the universe that I have no business dating and if I want a sex friend I must look to the rubber/silicone variety

I’m a 37-year-old woman from sunny Florida, hoping to connect with someone who has a deep love for travel — especially someone 50 or older who’s been around the world and still has that spark for discovering new places.

I’ve always believed that stories make life richer, and travel stories? Even better. Whether it’s a quiet village in Europe, a hidden beach in Asia, or a spontaneous road trip across the States, I’d love to hear about the moments that stayed with you — the places, people, and small details that made a lasting impression.

I’m warm, easygoing, and genuinely curious about the world. I enjoy meaningful conversations, dry humor, and people who are open-minded and kind. I don’t mind where you’re from — as long as you’re someone who’s lived a little, still loves exploring, and enjoys reflecting on where you’ve been.

If you're 50+ and still have your suitcase half-packed or just like revisiting travel memories over coffee or a good chat, I’d truly appreciate hearing from you. Let’s share some laughs, stories, and maybe a bit of wanderlust together.

I'm looking for roommates to find an apartment or join an existing place, ideally moving in July 1st ( though I'm a little flexible that )

A little about me, I've been living in NYC for about a year, working in the tech space. I'd describe myself as an ambivert - I love socializing, going out, hosting friends, and trying new things, but I also value my downtime to relax and recharge. I'm a massive music nerd, always listening to music & going to live gigs / shows. I also love to spend a lot of my time cooking, whether that's just for myself or for big groups. 

I'm looking for ideally 2 other roommates who are clean, tidy & respectful but also know how to have a good time. Super big on keeping common areas in a nice state. I have a budget of roughly 2300, probably have a little bit of wiggle room here but ideally would like something lower than this.

Happy to look anywhere that isn't too far away from the L train, whether this be in Manhattan or Williamsburg / Brooklyn. If you are looking for any roommates to move in around this time, don't hesitate to comment or message me !

Always happy to organize a FaceTime or a coffee to get a quick pulse 😇

I really enjoyed my Vertuo Plus, but I’ve noticed that they’ve released several new machines since I got mine a few years ago. I’ve heard some of them have issues (the next maybe? Correct me if I’m wrong) 

Anyway, I’d love to hear opinions on if I should just replace it with the same machine or if there’s a better one out there to “upgrade” to. I only ever used the single and double espresso, and occasionally the 8oz. I don’t really care to have the larger options because we have a regular drip coffee machine too. If I want a lot of coffee, I’ll just use that.

How did you cope when you didn't know if you'd been diagnosed? I've done a lot of googling... perhaps too much googling. I have started to alter my diet significantly. I am reducing coffee. I have a good night's rest and then a poor night's rest. Any advise or wisdom you could share would be most welcome <3 I feel like this is all I can think about.

The job pays well: RM9,000 gross, with an estimated RM7,370 after deductions.

My monthly spending is roughly:

RM1,500 on food (RM40/day, RM80 on weekends). Johor food prices exp af like KL, and I need coffee on daily basis

RM800 parent allowance

RM200 internet & mobile data

RM100 car maintenance

RM200 petrol, tolls, car wash

RM400 life insurance (investment-linked)

RM150–200 gym (haven’t started yet—still looking for promotions)

RM100–200 on social/badminton

RM200 groceries

RM500 travel fund

RM3,000 savings for future dream house (Currently renting a middle room for RM850, inclusive of utilities)

Some context:

I’m very careful with spending. I only carry one UOB credit card (monthly rm20-30 cashback) for convenience (fully paid every month).

My car loan is fully paid off as of last year but I understand sometimes need maintenance cost

Part 1 (PRS):

Since I started in June, I estimate my annual income will be RM63K. After tax reliefs, my income tax is about RM1K.

Would investing RM3K in PRS be worth it? I calculated that the tax return is around 6% of RM3K, but PRS's past performance doesn’t look encouraging.

Part 2 (Budget&Investment):

i) Any room to reduce spending apart from food (which I plan to tackle via meal prep)? Just started renting a room from the owner, so still figuring out how to manage meal prep here.

*Recent big purchases include: RM1K spectacles, RM4K laptop (for daily use), build a full PC setup in a year

ii) The difference (RM2150) between monthly rent and expected future monlthy mortgage will be saved for future furniture and downpayment. Also I have some FD. What are the best investment vehicles nowadays for that savings? TNG GO+? S&P 500? EPF? KDI Invest?

iii) I want to save up RM500/month for travelling to stay sane. Would putting it in Wise be a good idea? I usually just exchange enough foreign currency before trips.

iv) Any credit cards are recommended nowadays? I'm also thinking of RHB Shell card

Anyway, this is the way that seminal retention is practiced, it is the way that I see as natural for men, to maintain sexual intercourse, but only actually ejaculate when generating a new life, I have infinite energy after, in addition to weekly retention, I follow an ancestral diet, based on protein and fat of animal origin, I sunbathe for half a day naked every day, and I practice yoga daily, in addition to various other sports, these practices that I mentioned with emphasis are the ones that elevate my vital energy and purify my body, I have so much energy that I feel my body relearning how to deal with purity and abundance of energy, and basically if I take something that generates more energy, my body does not have enough capacity to deal with it and simply goes into malfunction, when I drink coffee, soda, energy drinks, etc., I feel migraines that last almost 24 hours, which is the time the product takes effect on my body, it is not in my routine to drink any type of drink like that, I only take it in sporadic social conditions.

This is my statement guys, the summary of the opera.

It was a serious one and the prognosis was not good initially, but he’s a fighter and is now on the road to recovery and was discharged from hospital last week.

My sister (31F) and I (29F) have a complicated relationship with him. He and our mum separated about 8 years ago after he had an affair with my mum's friend. Their marriage was not a happy one and they should have separated years earlier, but the affair was the bomb that blew it all up. I made a considerable effort to stay connected with him and even was actively accepting of his new partner (the woman he had the affair with). I genuinely liked her before any of this happened and made an effort to be supportive, despite the circumstances. My sister did not take it all as well, but she still maintained a slightly more strained relationship with him.

Over time though, it felt like he chose his new life and family over us. He didn’t tell us when he remarried, and moved back into our childhood home with her, which our mum had just moved out of, expecting it to be sold. It all felt very underhand and an active move to shut us out.

When he had the stroke, we dropped everything and rushed home to be by his side in hospital. His wife was there too, and initially things were friendly. But after a few days, she started avoiding us when we visited. Before we left that first week, I spoke with her to offer support and reassure her that we wanted to help. The conversation turned emotional, and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with us being at the house. Her reasoning was that since we’d previously said we didn’t feel right visiting (which was true - it felt painful being back in our old home now with his replacement family), that nothing had changed and she still didn’t want us there.

We respected that and for two months, we’ve been making long day trips (we live 100 miles away) to see him in hospital.

Now that he's home, we reached out about visiting over Father’s Day weekend. We kept it open-ended and said we were happy to work around what felt appropriate for him and her. She replied suggesting we meet for a coffee in town, for exactly one hour, as they need to be home for his carers, meds, and so he can rest. I understand he’s still fatigued and adjusting to life at home, but a 6-hour round trip for one hour with him feels unreasonable.

I can’t shake the feeling she’s putting up barriers. I don’t want to question her intentions outright, I know she’s been doing a huge amount to care for him and this is a difficult transition. But it’s starting to feel like she’s gatekeeping him from us. My dad isn’t great with tech or communication since the stroke, and all contact has to go through her now.

What’s the best way to navigate this? I want to be respectful and constructive, not blow things up, but I also want to be honest that we are a part of his life and we need to find a way to move forward in a way that is comfortable for all of us.


TLDR:  Dad’s recovering from a stroke, but our step-mum is restricting visits and won’t let us in the house. We’re worried she’s gatekeeping him and not sure how to address it without making things worse.",1,1749082851.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

As a stringman myself, I wandered over and silently watched him play for a few moments. He was good. A deep, soulful blooz flowed from his fingie-wingies. Behind him, a sign simply read “Little Boy Blue.”

I fumbled around in the pocket of my jeans for a minute and a half and extracted a few cents in loose change. One by one, I effortlessly flipped various denominations of coin into the case that was open in front of him, as one would a wishing well. I noticed he had already amassed a small fortune, or what must be a regular fortune for him. 

“Hey, man,” I drawled. “Pardon the question, but does being a spectacle for your size ever make you feel, well, small, for lack of a better term?”

He stopped playing and took a sip of iced water from the shot glass that sat on a stool next to him. It looked perfectly proportional in his hands.

“There is a better term, actually,” he politely corrected me. “Microscopic. Almost invisible. I’ve been playing guitar since I was six inches tall, and all people see when they look at me is a circus freak, not a guitarist. But it pays the bills, so I try to think of it as a blessing in disguise.”

I solemnly nodded to the homunculus. “Sometimes people can’t look past the outside to see what’s on the inside.” I pondered my clumsy aphorism, since his gibbons was also on the outside, then agreed with myself anyways.

“Exactly,” he replied, as he continued his music-making. “Do you play?”

I admitted: “A little bit for fun, not nearly as well as you. But enough to appreciate what you’re doing.”

He shrunk slightly at my comment, or at least he would’ve, if that were possible. “Thanks.” 

I went to the counter to buy a coffee. At the end of my transaction, I casually inquired with the barista, “Hey, where’d you get that fuckin’ midget? He rocks.”

“You wouldn’t believe it,” she said. “He just walked in here one day asking to play for tips, and blew us all away. That was years ago, but he’s still here every week.”

“What are the odds?” I affirmed. I walked back to an open table and sat down. A coincidence like that gets one thinking. “Really, we’re all midgets in the grand scheme of the universe,” I mused to myself smugly.

When it was time to leave, I glanced back at Little Boy Blue as I walked out, in a show of cosmic midget solidarity. He looked back at me and gave a knowing nod.

""Savannah's father once saved my life, Sierra. Can’t you just do this one thing for me? I swear, the moment you’re out, I’ll marry you.""  
  
I nodded through my tears, but what was supposed to be a two-month sentence turned into six years.  
  
When I tried to recant my confession, I was met with brutal beatings.  
  
""Someone out there told us to keep you on a fucking leash. Who the hell do you think you are? Take a hard look in the mirror before you even think about laying your filthy hands on Mr. Carter!""  
  
They beat me until my eyes were bloodshot. As I lost consciousness, the last thing I saw was the TV screen showing Landon Carter embracing his childhood sweetheart Savannah Blake at their engagement party.  
  
My heart turned to ash. After six grueling years that felt like a lifetime, I was finally released.  
  
But as I quietly boarded the train with my luggage, Landon Carter's assistant appeared before me with a respectful bow.  
  
""Miss Jameson, Mr. Carter would like to see you.""  
  
\---  
  
I sat in the car watching the city rush past in reverse. Six years had transformed New York City beyond recognition. The car drove past a towering skyscraper with a giant billboard broadcasting the news: ""NYC's wealthiest bachelor Landon Carter purchases nine figures on a necklace for his new girlfriend as the couple enters their luxury mansion together.""  
  
Nine figures. I counted slowly in my dulled mind.  
  
I looked down at the beaded bracelet on my wrist that he'd bought me six years ago. Two dollars, though the cord had long since faded and frayed.  
  
I gently untied it and tossed it out the window without a second thought..  
  
We'd arrived at a mansion, before I knew it. And Lost in thought, I barely noticed the assistant handing me a phone.  
  
Landon Carter's deep, pleasant voice came through the line.  
  
""Sierra, I'm tied up with something right now. Wait for me at the house, okay?""  
  
I listened quietly, waiting three seconds after he finished before slowly responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""  
  
Landon paused, seemingly puzzled by my response.  
  
Six years had made me much quieter. I was no longer the girl who used to chatter away at him endlessly.  
  
After he hung up, I sat in the mansion waiting. The housekeeping staff exchanged glances and whispered behind my back.  
  
""Looks like Mr. Carter brought home another one. This one’s all bones and not even that cute.""  
  
""I heard she just got out of prison.""  
  
""Oh my God, what a disaster. Mr. Carter's taste is getting weird. At least before it was actresses, models, socialites... but this one is just...""  
  
They sighed dramatically, as if feeling sorry for Landon Carter.  
  
I didn't really care, but I couldn't stop checking my watch. It had been seven hours since Landon said he'd be ""a while.""  
  
I hadn't eaten since leaving prison, and with the air conditioning blasting, I was both cold and starving.  
  
Finally, I asked the butler where Landon was. After just two questions, he gave me this annoyed look—like I was just one of those girls constantly throwing themselves at Landon.  
  
""Mr. Carter is with Miss Blake right now. They're watching fireworks on his yacht. He doesn't have time for you.""  
  
Savannah Blake. Her name flashed through my mind.  
  
Six years ago, she drove drunk and seriously injured two pedestrians.  
  
I was the one who went to prison in her place.  
  
That's how I went from being Sierra Jameson, the beloved daughter of the Jameson family, to a despised criminal.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Meanwhile, she transformed herself from a girl from the projects into a golden phoenix, spoiled by Landon Carter like a princess.  
  
But I didn't care anymore.  
  
After my family went bankrupt and my parents couldn't handle the shame and killed themselves, nothing could stir even the slightest emotion in my heart.  
  
Except for the two things Landon had promised me before I went to prison.  
  
First, that he would marry me.  
  
Second, that he would get back my family's turquoise heirloom bracelet.  
  
Now I didn't want to get married anymore. My only wish was to get back that heirloom.  
  
Lost in thought, the gnawing pain in my stomach grew more vicious. I clutched my stomach and walked to the kitchen.  
  
When I tried to make something for myself, a housekeeper rudely slapped my hand away.  
  
""Don't touch anything. Mr. Carter and Miss Blake don’t want some outsider messing around in their kitchen.""  
  
""Just wait it out.""  
  
She rolled her eyes at me and walked away.  
  
After another three hours, Landon still hadn't returned. I collapsed on the couch, everything went black, and I passed out completely.  
  
When I woke up, I was lying in bed with an IV drip. A doctor had been called.  
  
Landon had his back to me, scolding the housekeepers.  
  
""Are you fucking stupid? She’s starving and not one of you thought to make her a damn meal?""  
  
""Next time this shit happens, you're all fired!""  
  
Savannah Blake walked in at the sound. ""Landon, don't angry. Come have some coffee.""  
  
She pulled him out of the room.  
  
The housekeepers looked at each other with pale faces.  
  
""That scared me. Mr. Carter hasn't been that angry in ages.""  
  
""It's all her fault! Acting all pitiful and getting us yelled at!""  
  
""Don’t get cocky—she’ll be gone in two months anyway.""  
  
They hurried away.  
  
I removed the IV needle and slowly walked out.  
  
The first person to see me was one of Landon's friends. He obviously didn't know who I was and asked curiously:  
  
""Landon, is this a new housekeeper? Why is she coming out of your bedroom?""  
  
Landon spun around, and when our eyes met, his pupils visibly contracted.  
  
After six years apart, he was still as elegant and handsome as ever.  
  
But I looked like a weary traveler at the end of her journey, my face etched with exhaustion and hardship.  
  
Savannah laughed lightly and gracefully walked over. Playing the role of lady of the house, she said to the man in the gray suit:  
  
""Reed, this is... a relative of Landon's from his hometown. Not a housekeeper.""  
  
I looked at Landon. He watched me silently without contradicting her.  
  
I guess he really was too embarrassed to be associated with me now.  
  
Which made sense. I was just an ex-con now, and it had been six years since our engagement. Things had changed.  
  
During the awkward silence, the chef finished preparing dinner.  
  
After we sat down, they started talking about recent events. I couldn't follow any of it, so I focused on eating.  
  
But suddenly, Reed Collins said with surprise:  
  
""Oh man, your ex from prison’s probably getting out soon, huh?""  
  
""Whatever, just throw her some cash and make sure she stays the hell away.""  
  
Instantly, the lively dinner table fell silent.  
  
Savannah glanced at me casually, her mocking smile clearly visible.  
  
Landon kept his expression steady and didn't respond.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Reed sensed something was off and was about to say something when I suddenly smiled and said calmly, ""She won't.""  
  
Reed looked curious and turned to ask why.  
  
I slowly swallowed my food, but before I could open my mouth, Landon interrupted in a low voice.  
  
""Enough. Just eat.""  
  
He stared at me intently, his eyes churning with dark emotions.  
  
I kept my head down and continued eating, unmoved.  
  
After dinner, as Reed was leaving, he noticed the piano in the living room and commented admiringly:  
  
""Wow, nice piano. Who’d you buy that for?""  
  
Savannah gracefully sat down and began playing smoothly.  
  
After finishing the piece, she looked at the admiration in Reed's eyes and said modestly:  
  
""I only started learning piano recently, but my teacher says I’ve got real talent—better than people who’ve been playing for like ten years.""  
  
She shot me a look while saying it—yeah, that was definitely aimed at me.  
  
I had learned piano, violin, and traditional instruments since childhood, with piano being my strongest. I'd even performed at a prestigious concert hall as an adult.  
  
Savannah had always been jealous when she found out, constantly saying that if she'd had money for lessons, she would have been better than me.  
  
Now, after six years in prison, she assumed I'd gotten rusty.  
  
So she smiled sweetly at me. ""Sierra, I heard you studied for a long time. Why don't you play something for us?""  
  
Landon frowned, seeming like he wanted to stop me.  
  
But my fingers were already on the keys.  
  
The next second, a rich, rhythmic melody flowed naturally from the piano.  
  
Compared to Savannah's beginner-level playing, the difference was immediately obvious.  
  
Landon and Reed both looked impressed. When I finished, they both applauded.  
  
Savannah's face turned green with rage as she glared at me.  
  
Reed walked over to me, his tone taking on a serious note:  
  
""That was amazing—I didn’t know you were that good. I actually have a concert grand at my place. Would you like to come by and play it.""  
  
I opened my mouth but hadn't answered yet when Landon suddenly spoke up: ""It's getting late. You should head out. And remember to take Savannah home.""  
  
Reed looked at me with some regret and left with Savannah, who kept looking back over her shoulder.  
  
The spacious living room was left with just Landon and me.  
  
I hunched my shoulders. The air conditioning was on full blast, but his expression was even colder than the air.  
  
Landon grabbed my wrist.  
  
His tone was nasty, almost cruel: ""Sierra Jameson, flirting around the minute you get out. Do you have any dignity left as a woman?""  
  
I didn't react much to his words, just gave a faint twist of my lips.  
  
What dignity did I have left as a woman? I'd lost nearly twenty pounds.  
  
The youthful vitality was gone from my face.  
  
Seeing me stay silent, he looked stunned. I used to love arguing with him.  
  
But now, looking at my almost lifeless expression, his heart suddenly felt like it was being stabbed with needles.  
  
His tone suddenly softened: ""I didn’t mean it like that.""  
  
""I'll make this right for you, just not now. Our marriage still stands.""  
  
When he mentioned marriage, his voice suddenly paused.  
  
He said slowly, ""I’ll make it up to you, just… not right now. And our marriage? That still counts.""  
  
Landon stared intently at my expression, as if my earlier answer really mattered to him.

1l3lgfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalMBA/comments/1l3lgfa/insead_essay_tips_20252026/,INSEAD essay tips - 2025-2026,"Hello, I hope I am welcome to post these here. Hopefully, something sparks ideas for waitlist updates as well, if that applies. 

**What’s important to keep in mind is INSEAD’s 4 criteria, their rubric for evaluating you. These should be felt in the various application components.**

1 - academic capacity (transcripts, scores)

2 - leadership potential (chiefly this means taking the initiative to solve problems that make an organizational impact, but people management can also be part of this)

3 - ability to contribute - bringing something unique/additive to the class, having a pay-it-forward mentality (keep in mind they have 2 alums interview each candidate!)

4 - international motivation - openness and also goals/need/motivation for a UN-style program

So, you want these to be felt in the various parts of the application.

***Question 1: Job Description/Career Trajectory ""Provide a summary of your career since graduating from university, explaining the rationale behind your key decisions and career progression. Include a description of your current (or most recent) role, covering the scope of your work, major responsibilities, employees under your supervision, budget size, clients/products, and any notable results achieved."" (500 words maximum)***

This is an on-paper “walk me through your resume” and your recommenders are asked a similar question. INSEAD is trying to get a sense of your career trajectory, but also, understand how you might answer the “walk me through your resume” question when interviewing with their recruiting companies.

What I often see is a “resume redux” which is a bit of a missed opportunity. You want to focus on your “why” –  this is especially advantageous if there is a specific passion or purpose behind your choices, a throughline. A higher overarching purpose.

This question also sets the perfect context for the next question on your goals. Once they have the TLDR version of where you have been, and where you are now, they can see if your goal sounds achievable. And if they can help you with the gaps you hope to fill at INSEAD to position yourself for success.

***Question 2: Goals + Why INSEAD ""Describe your short- and long-term career aspirations, including your target geography, industry, and function. How do you plan to bridge the gap between your current position and these goals, and how will INSEAD help you achieve them?"" (300 words maximum)***

Work experience + INSEAD = short term goal + experience = long term goal

Your goal should be within reach, where it’s clear that you can reach it with the requisite effort and that INSEAD adds value.

In the current environment, you might want to be more conservative on-paper. Even if you have a finance background, you might pick going to work for a portfolio company vs. VC, making VC the long-term goal.

If you’re a consultant, PE might be possible post-MBA in some geographies, but it might be wise to state IB as your goal (if you are going for January intake, of course.)

If you want to crack MBB, or T2, it’s important to show you have done enough research to know what you bring to the position and also what you’re up against. What qualities will help you pass behaviors? Have you tried solving a case? How are your modeling skills?

Speak confidently but candidly - and specify how the resources at INSEAD will fill the gaps. If you can manage to fit it, speak to interactions you had with alums or at events to substantiate your statements about what INSEAD offers.

***Question 3: Strengths & Weaknesses ""Give a candid description of yourself as a person and a leader, emphasising the strengths and weaknesses you recognise in yourself. Explain how you are actively working on your development, sharing key experiences that have shaped you, providing specific examples where relevant."" (500 words maximum)***

It's interesting they have now added “and a leader” and “actively working on your development” to this already ambitious prompt. I imagine they wanted to give applicants another opportunity to demonstrate leadership - one of their four criteria - beyond the resumes and recommendations. Also, it seems they might be trying to protect the student experience by sifting out those afflicted with narcissistic personality disorder, who don’t believe they *have* any flaws or need to develop themselves.

I think the best approach here would be to share one or two experiences that have shaped your strengths, one as a person, and one as a leader. Then, share one or two experiences where you became aware/made to face your weaknesses. Share the efforts you’ve made to work on one or more of these weaknesses. Ideally one of these weaknesses might speak to the “gaps” you hope to work on at INSEAD.

I wouldn’t recommend turning this into another letter of recommendation but rather touching on more universal themes (with specific examples, however) so they can get a 360-degree perspective on who you are.

***Question 4: Stressful Situation ""Describe a highly stressful situation you faced and how you managed it. What did this experience teach you about yourself and your interactions with others?"" (400 words maximum)***

Would recommend you use CARR format for this: challenge, action, result, reflection.

What they are seeking is self-awareness, humility, and capacity to adapt and grow.  One of my clients wrote about how he and his team had failed to do a deep-enough dive into the culture and presented a solution that went against the spiritual beliefs of the village they were trying to help.

Do not fear discussing similar setbacks. Often, I find applicants are very preoccupied with putting forth a strong face, but this creates a barrier to admissions trusting you or feeling a connection with you. If you only show strengths and successes they won’t feel they are getting to know you, which is the only reason they are reading all this stuff anyways.

Facing challenges and learning from setbacks is what shows leadership, and what makes your application relatable and interesting. It also shows maturity, coachability, and readiness to gain what INSEAD could give you.

***Question 5 –  Activities***

***""Describe the activities you listed above and explain how they have enriched your life (e.g., skills developed, personal growth, community impact)."" (300 words maximum)***  

So, the CV, recommendations, and job essays all speak to your professional life, and this is your chance to show how you have achieved impact outside of work.

INSEAD is an especially social program, and they want to know you would be a social value-add. You want to present yourself as well-rounded and multidimensional, someone who can talk about things other than work with your fellow INSEADers. In sum, interesting.

While they do speak about community impact, I encourage you to include the more hard-hitting numbers in your CV and use this section more to speak from the heart on how various activities have shaped your values and enlivened you. Switch gears here and take a softer and warmer approach that helps them get to know you as a person.

So commonly I see dinged applications where the candidate “made their case” in an almost defensive way, telegraphing arrogance or insecurity, rather than talking to admissions as you would a friend. This is what they mean when they say, “be yourself” or “don’t tell us what you think we want to hear.”

INSEAD says on their blog:

*Be original*

*We encourage you to stay away from clichés and to create original content. In other words, we want to get to know the real “you”, so be honest and reflect deeply on what unique experience you can bring to the programme. It may help you to think about what you would say to a friend or a sibling over coffee in response to each of the questions.*

It’s really a simple switch in mindset from trying to prove yourself to letting someone into your world, vulnerably yet confidently, knowing the little things that make you “you” are enough.

***Question 6 – Optional Essay***

***Optional Essay: Is there anything else that was not covered in your application that you would like to share with the Admissions Committee? ( 300 words)***

Optional essays come in 2 forms, either explanations for red flags or space to share more about yourself. Given there is no language here saying “please only share” or “do not consider this an additional essay” you have complete freedom.

Reflect on what you (and possibly your recommenders) have already shared and what you still need to illustrate in terms of their criteria of academic capacity, leadership, contribution and international motivation.

This looks a bit different for each person. If your GMAT quant score is low, but you tutor math or statistics to masters’ students, that might be a great way to show both academic capacity and contribution.

Usually, I recommend articulating how you intend to contribute at INSEAD in this essay because there is no specific place to include this elsewhere (the why INSEAD part is combined with goals, but the “why you” isn’t).

Think about what skills or areas of specialized knowledge you have, and how it might help others. For example, if you have a long work history with green energy, maybe you could do a workshop that might help sponsored consulting students get those kinds of projects returning to MBB.

This essay is an opportunity to showcase the research you have done on the program. Ask the head of the consulting club, VC club etc, what could be done better, what is missing there that I could help with?

INSEAD is looking for people who are community-builders who have a generous spirit. Having 2 alums interview you is a big commitment on their part, so you might want to speak about how you can contribute while you are there, but also beyond.

Seen three gastro docs and they say they can’t help me. My GE STUDY showed only 5% of egg and half a piece of bread after four hours. Since then went to Froedert extension. For help and the APNP gastro and had no idea why I was even there. I can’t take the usual meds because I’m allergic or I would end up with tardive dyskinesia because of the psych meds I’m on and have been on for decades. Also the long qt interval effect is a no no for me as I have two arrhythmias and already have a long qt interval. Been waiting seven months now to see a doctor’s fellow at the main campus of Froedert hospital in Wisconsin. My appt is late July and I’m already on cancellation list. I have been ensuring most terrrible cramping everyday and on and off diarrhea most of the month with one week of constipation. My menstrual cycle affects it so much. At least until. Now. Nothing has been the same with my symptoms this cycle and today was the worst day of pain IN MY LIFE. for perspective I’ve had hip surgery, both heals broken at the same time and a partial nephrectomy. Tattoos in the most sensitive of areas and do have. High tolerance for pain. Gastroparesis pains today were the worst pains of my life.  They have been crippling before but as I was grocery shopping my stomach largely where I have a grade three hiatal hernia began and I was crippled and unable to move. I immediately became hunchbacked and curled from the pain. So bad I was barely able to walk. Finally made it to check out and thought I was going to have to call an ambulance. Have no clue what my body is doing. I have reached out to previous gastro specialists and they say that they can’t help me. Not even suggestions for the cramping. I did see a dietician who gave me a vegetarian and vegan diet special for gastroparesis and that’s as far as I’ve gotten. I wanted to get a food sensitivity test done but insurance. ( I have Medicaid and Medicare as I am on disability for many years now) insurance won’t cover it. 

Any home remedies or advice to get through this? I’ve found that ginger tea helps me at night but I know yea and coffee should not be part of the diet.

Hey MaximizeMe community! So, I decided to challenge myself with 30 days of deliberate cold exposure, and let me tell you... the results were *chillingly* fantastic! I'm talking about the kind of focus where you feel like you can see through walls, but you're also super chill about it. 🙃

**Here's the scoop:** Every morning, I rolled out of bed and into a cold shower. Yep, cold showers in winter! I know, I know—it sounds like pure madness. But hear me out. The science suggests this can seriously impact cortisol levels, and who doesn't want to give stress the cold shoulder?

Here are some surprising changes I noticed:

- **Bye-Bye Cortisol**: I felt less stressed and just generally happier. My usual morning anxiety? It was like it took a vacation to somewhere warm and sunny without me.
  
- **Focus for Days**: I kid you not, my ability to concentrate skyrocketed! 🌠 Suddenly, those work projects that usually seemed daunting started to feel like an exciting puzzle.
  
- **Energy Boost**: Somewhere between day 10 and 15, I stopped hitting the snooze button. Consistently. Who knew a cold shower could be more refreshing than coffee?
  
- **Unshakeable Mood**: Not even my boss, who must sunbathe on the cracks of doom each morning, could ruffle my feathers. Who else has noticed this boost in mood resilience?

Now, this isn't to say I turned into a superhuman (though honestly, sometimes it felt that way). But seriously, it really does wonders for *waking* you up and helping you feel alive. ⚡

Some exciting geeky bits for my fellow science buffs:

- **Brown Fat Activation**: Yeah, it's a thing. Apparently, cold exposure helps activate brown fat, which burns calories to generate heat. So essentially, I was *shivering* my way to better energy levels.

- **Increased Endorphins**: That's the happy stuff! Cold exposure is basically free happiness... in liquid form.

# Best chocolate Tequila 2025: Reviews & Top picks

Chocolate tequila is a captivating fusion that elevates the conventional tequila experience. It seamlessly blends the boldness of agave with the rich, decadent flavors of chocolate, creating a uniquely appealing spirit. For connoisseurs and casual drinkers alike, chocolate tequila offers a delightful departure from conventional options, providing a refined and indulgent taste.

As we move into 2025, the market is filled with a variety of chocolate tequilas, each promising a distinctive experience. Finding the best among them requires a careful evaluation of flavor profiles, production methods, and overall quality. This review aims to guide you through the top choices, ensuring you select the perfect bottle to savor or share.

## Key Features Analysis

The best chocolate tequilas set themselves apart through several critical features, impacting their overall flavor, aroma, and drinking experience.

**Agave Quality:** Premium chocolate tequilas begin with high-quality agave, typically 100% blue agave. This ensures a smooth and authentic tequila base onto which the chocolate flavors can blend seamlessly. The type and maturity of the agave considerably affect the tequila's underlying character, influencing its sweetness and complexity.

The agave used must be ripe, carefully harvested, and properly cooked to extract the purest sugars.Brands committed to quality often source their agave from specific regions known for producing the best plants,such as the highlands or lowlands of Jalisco,Mexico.The region’s terroir imparts distinct characteristics to the agave, which ultimately affects the tequila’s unique taste profile.

**Chocolate Infusion Method:** There are several methods for infusing tequila with chocolate flavor, and the chosen method profoundly impacts the final product.Some producers use natural cocoa extracts or nibs, while others opt for artificial flavorings.The best chocolate tequilas rely on natural, high-quality cocoa to deliver an authentic, nuanced chocolate taste.

The infusion process itself varies. Some methods involve macerating cocoa nibs directly in the tequila,while others use a chocolate liqueur or syrup. The duration and temperature of the infusion are carefully controlled to achieve the desired balance between tequila and chocolate flavors. Artisanal methods, which are frequently enough more time-consuming and labor-intensive, generally produce a superior and more naturally integrated flavor profile.

**Tequila Type:** The type of tequila used as the base is crucial.Blanco (or silver) tequila offers a clean, unaged flavor, allowing the chocolate notes to shine through prominently. Reposado tequila, aged in oak barrels for a few months, provides a subtle vanilla and spice character that can complement chocolate beautifully. Añejo tequila,aged for a year or more,imparts richer caramel and oak notes,creating a more complex and layered flavor.

The choice of tequila type depends on the desired flavor outcome. Blanco tequila is frequently enough preferred when the goal is to highlight the pure chocolate taste. Reposado and Añejo tequilas are suitable for those who prefer a more nuanced and sophisticated flavor with added depth. The type of barrel used for aging añejo tequila plays a crucial role in developing the richer caramel and oak profile.**Sugar Content:** The level of sugar added to the tequila greatly influences its sweetness and overall balance. Some chocolate tequilas contain excessive amounts of sugar, masking the tequila's inherent flavor. The best brands strike a delicate balance, adding just enough sugar to enhance the chocolate notes without overwhelming the spirit.

The inclusion of natural sweeteners, such as agave nectar or raw sugar, can contribute to a smoother and more refined sweetness. Producers who prioritize quality often focus on creating a harmonious blend between the tequila’s natural agave sweetness and the chocolate's inherent sweetness. Too much sugar can result in a cloying mouthfeel, detracting from the overall drinking experience.

The aroma of agave mixed with cocoa provides an inviting olfactory experience, while the smooth tequila taste, balanced with the sweet chocolate, delivers a complex and delightful palate sensation.

The interplay between the warm tequila finish and the lingering chocolate aftertaste elevates the experience beyond that of a typical spirit. Those who appreciate the craftsmanship involved in creating a well-balanced flavor profile find chocolate tequila to be a rewarding indulgence that transcends the ordinary alcoholic beverage.

Fiance (33M) and I (35F) moved into our first home in a really nice quiet neighborhood in 2019. Think mostly elderly retired neighbors, some families with kids, small town/suburb vibes. From the get-go, I became friends with the neighbors to our right (elderly retired couple) who welcomed us into the neighborhood. Wasn't really close with any of the other neighbors, but we didn't bother them and they didn't bother us. Right after we first moved into our home, there was a crazy thunderstorm and we discovered we had a river flowing in our basement. Cue Fiance's project (that spanned 4 years) of digging a trench all around our house down to the foundation in order to waterproof the basement, create french draining, and insulate the basement from the outside with panels. Digging down to the foundation meant that in some areas, he was digging a whopping 10 feet down. All that dirt had to go somewhere, so we were holding it all in our backyard (rip grass) on tarps.

One Friday night about 8 months after we first moved in, around 9 PM, our power was abruptly and suddenly turned off. We were obviously confused and looked at the other houses to see if it was just us or the entire neighborhood. Lo and behold, some random men were walking through our backyard, looking at the power lines that ran to our rear neighbor's house. I didn't think much of it except that it was rude of him to not notify any of his neighbors that he was having the electric company come out and shut off the power to look at a problem he was having. Around 2-3 AM, it was turned back on, so I figured the problem was dealt with and went to bed.

Next morning around 7-8 AM, I was woken up by a pounding on our front door. I looked and saw an older man standing at our door. Considering I only got around 4 hours of sleep, I was very much not awake, but opened the door anyway.  
  
First words this man spoke to me: ""You need to move your dirt off my fence.""   
  
I must have had a really dumb look on my face because I was half asleep, so he decided to repeat himself, louder, and more slowly: ""YOU. NEED. TO. MOVE. YOUR. DIRT. OFF. MY. $6700. FENCE."" (For added context, this older man is white, and I am Asian.)   
  
His fence is a pristine white privacy fence that stretches 7 feet high, built 2 inches from the property line, and it gets powerwashed every other week by his wife (only on his side). I am confused by 2 things: Why he was yelling at me about dirt in our backyard, and how he even knew we had dirt in our backyard. 

I decided I was not dealing with this man (I was sleepy AF, didn't even have coffee yet) so I woke up Fiance to deal with this problem. He takes the older man into our backyard, with a tape measure, to show him that all the dirt and rocks that we had in OUR backyard were nowhere near his fence, A good 6 inches to a foot away from his fence. All the while, he's bitching about how it's putting pressure on his fence and his fence cost him a lot of money and yadda yadda yadda. Fiance took photos as proof that none of the dirt was touching his fence and he huffed back into his home after about 20 minutes. After that incident, nothing else has really happened until now, so I figured whatever, dude probably was annoyed that he had to call the electric company because he let a tree grow into his power lines and screw with his shit, one of them probably told them about the dirt in our backyard because they were having to walk all over it to reach said power lines.

Our house sits up higher than his house does. Even with his privacy fence, I can see straight into his living room and watch his TV with him. The fence does practically nothing to protect his privacy from us. We are not by any means snooping on him or his wife, because we keep to ourselves and don't care about them. 

Now it's this year, and Fiance has been working on building a shed in our backyard so he can store all his tools and stuff. He's a super meticulous person when it comes down to things like this, and I'm pretty sure that shed will outlast us all. He dug 16 holes 6 feet into the ground in order to pour cement pillars, metal brackets, self-treated lumber for the foundation, the works. However, he also doesn't care about having to file permits to do things on his property because he sees it as an unnecessary expense. Even though he refused to get a permit, he made quadruple-sure that the specs for the shed would be within all the proper parameters. I told him that I knew the minute he stood the walls of the shed up, Man-Karen would see it and throw a fit. Told Fiance it would be satisfying AF to know that if he tried to report the construction, he'd get told that we were in our legal rights to build on our property. Fiance is stubborn and said nah, it's a waste of money, I should be able to do whatever I want on my property. I don't agree with his view, but this is his shed and I let him be.

Fiance was finally able to build and put up walls this past Sunday, after a super rainy May. Fiance's parents have even been by on Sunday and Monday in order to help out. On Tuesday when they were working on the rafters, an official came by and told Fiance that someone reported him for constructing a building without a permit, and that he needed to file the paperwork and get the permit before resuming construction. The official wasn't being an ass, he was just doing his job, and even allowed Fiance to finish putting in the rafter supports. All the while, Man-Karen was sitting in his living room, facing the shed and watching. I am sure he is just so pleased with himself for being a nuisance.

We have talked to the neighbors to Man-Karen's right previously (unrelated incident where we were looking for footage from their security cameras) and they have also told us they've had run-ins with him. He has literally no life besides his precious fence. He has little signs all over his front yard that tell all pet walkers that your pets are not allowed to pee or poo in his lawn. He literally is the neighborhood Man-Karen.

Fiance and I are feeling particularly petty towards this man. Any recommendations for petty revenge are welcome :) I know this was a long ride, and I thank anyone who made it this far.

tl;dr: Rear neighbor has been an asshole to us and stuck his nose in our business on more than one occasion for no other reason than to be a menace because he has no life. Looking for any suggestions on some petty revenge.",5,1749081855.0,neighborsfromhell,3,1.0,False

I work in a little cafe in an organic grocery store. It’s a simple and laid back job but the cafe doesn’t make a whole lot of money so that is always in the back of my mind. Today, a somewhat regular customer came through with a cup of coffee she got from god knows where. She heads over to the milks and says “I’m just gonna grab a splash of milk for my coffee if that’s okay?” I paused for a moment and didn’t really tell her no but made it clear I was uncomfortable with that if she didn’t buy the coffee from me. The audacity has fogged my brain but she walked out seeming a little perturbed. I thought that would be the end of it but she came back about 5 minutes later and in her nicest Northern California hippy dippy frustration said “I don’t see what the big deal is. I spend thousands of dollars here and I tip you very well…” and that’s when I stopped listening cuz sometimes my brain does that when people are being silly.

1l3l3ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1l3l3ax/feeling_like_the_odd_one_out_in_my_program/,feeling like the odd one out in my program,"Located in the US. 

My (28F) trajectory through my PhD program was always going to be slightly atypical, given that I transferred from another program. I’ve completed one full year in the new program. I passed my qualifiers a year early, have all A grades, and am doing fine academically. 

The program I transferred from was more academically rigorous than my current program, and everyone at the former program had a very strong work ethic. At my former program, it was normal for senior grad students to publish 1-2 papers a year. In contrast, most students at my current program don’t publish at all before graduating, with the result that many of them don’t get academic jobs. Because I want to stay in academia, I’m still continuing to put a lot of time and energy into research and publishing, even if others around me aren’t. I already have a couple of papers under review/published, and I am occasionally invited to present at prestigious European workshops, etc. I also have a substantial additional merit scholarship that supports my ability to travel. While all of this looks great on my cv, I’m starting to sense that other students in my cohort resent me for having these opportunities that they don’t — despite the fact that many of these opportunities arise from my willingness to put extra time and energy into my research that they, for reasons I don’t fully understand, can’t or won’t. 

At the start of the year, I went out of my way to try to be that person who was friends with literally everyone else in the program. That backfired on me; I was so *overly friendly* to everyone that certain people in my cohort tried to take advantage of me and use me as their personal doormat/person who did their homework/designated person to mooch off of. A lot of smirks and other weird body language seemed to indicate that I was secretly disliked. I gradually discovered (to my shock and horror) that many of cohort members had a tendency to half-ass major assignments the night before they were due. (This kind of behavior absolutely would not fly at my former program.) Efforts to later set basic boundaries with people in my cohort (like “no, sorry, I don’t feel comfortable with letting you copy my homework”) resulted in the circulation of rumors about how “difficult” I was. The program director (whom I could make a whole series of posts about) even stuck a somewhat nasty note about my alleged personality flaws in my file on the basis of these people’s complaints. I gradually stopped hanging out with my cohort members as a group, and instead just made e.g. coffee plans with a couple of specific people I liked spending time with. But I eventually grew distant with even those people, as I came to realize that they had serious problems in their lives (drugs, abusive relationships) that were negatively affecting me and that I couldn’t help them with. After months of being ignored in the cohort group chat, I finally just muted it. I’ll check every once in a while to make sure I haven’t missed an important announcement, but I feel like I’m done trying to be in community with people who resent me, try to use me, or just otherwise drag me down. 

While I’m still long-distance/online friends with several people from my former program, I only get to see them at conferences every once in a while, and (given that I don’t have family anywhere near my current program) I feel like I don’t have an in-person support system at school apart from my advisor. I feel hesitant to reach out to anyone in my cohort now, even about work-related things, given that they mostly seem to just resent me. I’ve made a few casual friends through off-campus hobby groups, but it’s slow going. I just wish I had friends. I’m also disappointed that people in my cohort generally don’t like me, given that I came into the program with high hopes to the contrary. It also doesn’t seem like there’s much I can do to change how people in my cohort view me; even when I’m driving them to the airport and volunteering to watch their cats, they never reciprocate the favors, and they still ignore me and low-key act like they hate me. Talking with them is just so awkward now that I try to avoid it when possible. I’ve tried to be nice to them and, for whatever reason (jealousy? they don’t understand why I work the way I do? maybe I’m still the subject of office gossip?), they just aren’t receptive to it and/or are dead-set on not liking me. I’m sad about this but obviously I’m not going to continue to invest my energy in one-sided relationships that drain me. 

Has anyone else had this experience of being the outsider in their program? At this point I’m just trying to keep my head down and work to finish the degree. ",2,1749081622.0,GradSchool,0,1.0,False

1l3l2eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1l3l2eu/feeling_paradoxical_internally_struggling_to/,"Feeling paradoxical internally, struggling to understand medication","Hello,

  
I have been talking with my psychiatrist but wanted to hear personal thoughts or experiences and see if anyone relates. I often feel so hard to understand myself feel like I am full of contradictions. Both I feel too hyper and fast and restless and impulsive sloppy but also I am often extremely slow moving and slow decision making and nervous. Wish I more clearly fit into a hyperactive or inattentive box. I feel like I am more inattentive but because I am hyper in the sense that I notice everything and am so easily distracted. 

Have been trying stimulant medication. Different doses of Adderall and Vyvanse. I know they are kicking in because I feel Shakey and jittery like drinking coffee, but also loss of appetite too. But I don't feel like anything has gone quiet in my head, or an ability to focus? If I were to sit down and watch a play, I still occasionally get distracted or daydream and still my head goes on tangents and fixate just like I always have. So besides the more healthy eating choices and portion control from the apetite side effect, I haven't felt like this was doing anything for me.

Psych said I could try a non-stimulant medication which will maybe rile me up less. I am about to start guanfacine by itself to see if that relaxes me and gets me less distracted. 

I think I struggle so much talking about my experiences with medications to people because I can't pin down exactly how or what I feel. I generally am someone with some sensory issues or over stimulation but I am famously very calm and can handle extremely chaotic and scary situations. I also am a teacher. But if anything it doesn't rile me up or give me healthy choas, I just present very emotionless or apathetic. 

  
Curious if anyone relates to any of this and their experience with medication.

It's hard to talk to both and turn it on/off when speaking to both customers at the same time. I have autism and auditory processing issues, I've requested a noise cancelling headset with accomodations just waiting to hear back now.

It happened a few times where my coworkers would take the order for me but not ring it up, they'd be talking to the customer while making drinks or doing the oven and I couldn't ring it up or find it on the POS by the time I heard it. I would be handing off a drink to the customer at the window and talking to them, trying to figure out what they ordered bc we hadnt rung them up due to us getting backed up. The SSV for that shift came over and helped a few times, it didn't help we had a customer that requested something she saw on Facebook for her husband, another lady screaming and cussing at someone on the phone while our window is open and we had to tell her we had ran out of the double smoked bacon...and then another customer wanting 3 or 4 coffee travelers. It got crazy in that short amount of time and was overwhelming, I was holding back tears and I think I didnt fully cry because of my medication. Does it get easier?

Britt & Emma seemed to be the closest out of all the female pros. Especially through the last several tours. Ever since this tour ended and Emma hard launched with Alan (could be completely unrelated) and after the Hulu event I've noticed that they hardly interact on social media.

Britt hasn't commented on one of Emma's post in so long, she's also one of the only pros who didn't wish Alan a happy bday. And vice versa, Emma hasn't commented on one of hers in so long.

While I wouldn't normally think much of this - it caught my attention today because she was getting coffee with Sasha. Interesting since she hadn't even seen Emma (who she was much closer to) since the tour wrapped to our knowledge.

I know Britt isn't online much but Emma is a MAJOR commenter to all of the pros and their posts and hasn't commented on Britt's in a while ...that combined with her getting coffee with Sasha has me wondering.

Anybody else getting these vibes? Does she not support Alan and Emma together? I know Sasha is close with a lot of people I just thought them getting coffee today when we haven't seen her with Emma who's also in LA was telling",1,1749081298.0,Emlan,0,0.67,False

Welcome to the drama unfolding in the federal workforce with the Schedule Policy/Career shake-up. 🎭

Imagine this: 50,000 federal employees suddenly thrown into the ""at-will"" wild west, where job protection is tossed aside like last year's memo. Sure, it’s all under the guise of “enhancing accountability,” but at what cost? We're talking potential political purges that make Game of Thrones look like a friendly Monday meeting.

Here's the kicker: stripping civil servants of safety nets might just pave the way for a meritocracy... or maybe just a chaos-fueled merry-go-round where your next coffee break is your pink slip. Seriously, are we ready to gamble on creating a workplace where fear trumps performance?

Let’s face it, folks — burnout’s already through the roof, and now we're seeing another red flag waving over our careers. These moves make us question: when does accountability become a pretext for control? When do our rights and mental health take center stage?

3. **Day 4 Farmer's Market: worth it?**
4. Kuoloa Ranch: choosing between **UTV or e-Bike**! Both sound fun!
5. Other activities we're considering: **Snuba Diving**
6. **Coffee shop suggestions pls**! only have Island Vintage Coffee so far

And maybe you can relate.

**Introducing: The Anxiety Bees**

---

**First, please note that these are bees, not wasps.** They're supposed to help me pollinate my Fields of Human Connection with conscientiousness. But! They get a bit overenthusiastic about their threat detection.

---

**The Players:**

**Diane - The Bee of Atonement (and The Bee of Guilt):**
>When things go well, she lets you know when you might need to apologize to someone. Or when someone might need to apologize to you. When things go wrong, she stings until you think of every little thing you might have done to cause someone discomfort and then apologize for living.

**Brad - The Bee of Integrity (and The Bee of Character Assassination):**
>Brad is supposed to tell you when you're acting out of character. When he's on high alert, he stings every time you do something that doesn't conform to the highest character standard. Brad's superpower is taking that time you called in sick and turning it into a 5-page essay about how everyone will now think you have zero work ethic. He thinks that one bad deed erases a lifetime of good. 

**Greg - The Bee of Quality (and The Bee of Unfinished Expectations):**
>Greg checks your work and makes sure it's good enough to put out into the world. When he's on high alert, he finds a way to make everything better, more efficient, and 100% inhumanly imperfect. Nothing is ever good enough. When you put something into the world while Brad is on alert, he stings you into reviewing your work report for the 19th time while you're already past the deadline.

**Cheryl - The Bee of Connection (and The Bee of Unfounded Assumptions)**
>Cheryl is supposed to help you connect with others by determining how they feel and relating to it. When she's on high alert, she stings every time you think anyone has positive, or even neutral emotions in your presence. She thinks everyone hates you, and will not be convinced otherwise.

**Linda - The Bee of Loyalty (and The Bee of No Boundaries):**
>Linda reminds you of, and helps you keep your loyalty and commitments. When she is on high alert, she mistakes boundary-setting for abandoning commitment, and redefines codependency as ""showing up for people."" She stings every time a boundary is created or enforced.

**The Scene:**

**Morning in the hive:**

Dabrace wakes up and looks at a world that's full of wonder. But, it doesn't last long.

""It's too peaceful in here!"" Diane exclaims, sticking her head out of the hive. She buzzes angrily. ""Surely you've done something wrong already. You've been awake for five whole minutes!""

Dabrace racks her brain. ""Well, I did hit snooze three times. I didn't mean to, but I don't think it's that big a deal-""

""Not that big a deal!"" Brad joins the buzzing. ""Of course it's a bit deal. EVERYONE knows that people who hit snooze three times are lazy layabouts. Now, show them who's not a layabout by drinking three pots of coffee and doing the work of three departments!""

Dabrace groans, then pours coffee and adds sugar and cream.

**The Afternoon:**

Dabrace is in the office. She sees a friend in the hallway. 

""Hi, how are you?"" she says as she passes. Her friend looks deep in thought, and gives a small wave back.

""Oh. My. GOD!"" Cheryl exclaims. She emerges from the hive. ""Did you SEE the small wave he gave you?""

""Uh... yeah,"" Dabrace says, looking around. ""Seems like he wanted to say hi.""

""Uh... no,"" Cheryl counters. ""CLEARLY he hates you. Otherwise, he would have verbalized his hello, instead of waving. Do you want me to go fix it? I think I can fix it!""

""Um..."" Dabrace thinks for a moment. Then says, ""I think he was just thinking about something. Maybe work or -""

Greg flies over and stings Dabrace. ""OR he's thinking about how awful you are at human connection. You can't even say hello in the hallway properly! Taylor's diagnostics show that people who say hello in passing statistically have a voice that is 37% louder and more resonant than yours. Fix that, and you'll be unstoppable instead of... well...""

Diane blinks into existence. ""Maybe you should apologize for your voice!"" Diane suggests cheerfully.

Dabrace puts her head on her desk and groans.

---

**The Evening:**

Dabrace tucks into dinner, ravenous after a long day at the office. Just as she's about to take the first bite, her phone buzzes. It's a work email.

Linda flies serenely out of the hive and hovers, stinger poised and ready. ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" she asks.

""It's after work hours,"" Dabrace replies. ""I really don't think I -""

""OH! THE HUMANITY!!!"" Linda wails. ""What on earth are you on salary for, if you can't even answer one email off-hours?""

""But... dinner... rest... life..?"" Dabrace gestures vaguely.

""With how much they're paying you?"" Linda asks,  saccharine honey dripping from her words. ""Oh, honey...""

""Best apologize for taking more than five minutes to get back to them, too!"" Diane interjects from the other room. She starts humming.

1l3ks0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montessori/comments/1l3ks0l/am_i_nuts_i_want_to_make_our_dining_room_totally/,Am I nuts- I want to make our dining room totally toddler accessible,"My LO is nearly 21mo and has always been lukewarm about food. I think there are a few reasons at play with this but one of the main ones is that he has a strong need to move as much as possible. We have a high chair at the dining room table and a learning tower at the kitchen counter where we offer him food, but he often just plays with the food/throws it on the ground and asks to get out so he can continue running around downstairs. I want to get food in him, I want to respect him and meet him where he’s at, and I recently read that it’s developmentally normal for toddlers to eat by grazing rather than taking in larger quantities as meals; all this has lead me to strongly consider completely redoing our dining room set up so that LO can access food as he pleases and continue to move around the room as he needs. Is this idea completely insane?

I am thinking this would mean: we clear the room of everything except some closed and lockable cabinets for storage, we put an easily cleanable mat on the floor and a low table on that (like a coffee table, or maybe we just skip the table altogether? he would for sure climb on it), we get plates and bowls that we all use that LO can’t break; we get cups that can’t easily be spilled. We still have a fold out table and chairs that guests can use. We are under no illusions about mess being contained to the mat but accept the clean up as the trade off for LO eating more. Honestly, the biggest thing holding me back is it seems like a choking hazard to have him moving while eating, but we’ve already resorted to letting him snack while we sit in the living room as it’s the only way he’ll accept food. Otherwise, if given the choice between eating or moving, he just won’t eat. 

Apologies because I’m not sure this is strictly a Montessori question, but this seemed like the best place to ask from the perspective of being willing to radically shift towards what works best for a child. ",2,1749080717.0,Montessori,7,0.67,False
1l3kr4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/galapagos/comments/1l3kr4f/landbased_15_day_galápagos_itinerary/,Land-Based 15 Day Galápagos Itinerary,"My boyfriend and I just got back from the Galápagos and I had used this thread alongside blogs and guide books for planning this trip, so I wanted to share my itinerary in the hopes of helping others! We did not do a cruise, so this is more of a land-based “cheaper” alternative. However we vowed to come back one day to do a cruise because there are many islands you cannot visit without doing one! 

Day 0:
- Registered for the transit card on the Gobierno de Galapagos website

Day 1 (Arrival to Santa Cruz):
- Paid for the transit card at the booth at the Quito airport 
- Arrived to Isla Baltra, paid the $200 entry fee and exited the airport. Outside there is a ticket booth for the buses going to the ferry dock needed to cross the channel to get to Isla Santa Cruz. There was no trouble getting the bus as one was waiting there when we arrived. The tickets are $5 to the ferry and then $1 for the ferry. From the ferry we took a bus Puerto Ayora ($5). We got dropped about 1.5km from the town centre at a bus terminal of sorts. From here we walked to our hostel and it took about 25 minutes. There are also taxis waiting at the bus terminal, so if you have luggage there are easier ways to get to town. Fyi: even if you take the taxi from the bus terminal, I believe this option would be cheaper than taking the taxi from where the ferry drops you off in Santa Cruz from Baltra because you pay probably $2.50-$5 rather than the $20 from the ferry! 
- We checked into Morning Glory hostel and I highly recommend it for accommodation. The rooms were clean, the bed was comfy, there is a kitchen for cooking, and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.
- This day was our main “administration day” because we planned to shop for tours and book all our ferries between islands for the trip after we checked into our hostel. We heard you should try and book ferries a few days in advance because they can get filled up. You can book all your ferries between islands on one island.
- We shopped around for tours at a few places before landing on “Viajeros en Galapagos.” We bought three ferries and two tours (Isla Pinzon on Isla Santa Cruz and Los Túneles on Isla Isabela) for $300 in total. 

Day 2:
- Went to las grietas in the morning and it’s okay. You get there by taking a water taxi across the bay and then walking past Playa Alemán. You pay $10 to enter and it was underwhelming compared to the other sites and wildlife we would see later on the trip!
- If you’re planning on cooking, there’s a market in town called Mercado Municipal with a variety of fruits, veggies, and meats.
- We tried to go to Laguna Las Ninfas in the afternoon, but it happened to be closed for maintenance (I believe it’s already been closed for three months and I’m not sure when it’ll open again) 

Day 3:
- Isla Pinzón tour. I originally had my eye on Isla Bartolomé for a tour, but in the end, it was more expensive and you spend more time in transit to the island, so we decided on Isla Pinzón. Obviously, the animals you see depend on the day/time/season, but out of the four tours we did while in the Galapagos, this one was my least favourite, but only because it had the least amount of diversity in sea-life we were yet to see! This was also the only tour I did without a wet suit and I highly recommend renting one if you get cold easily. Also, all the tours we did with the exception of this one had guides with GoPros, so if you don’t have one, don’t worry you can almost always get underwater pictures of the wildlife! 

Day 4:
- I packed a lunch then walked to Tortuga Bay in the morning. It was an easy walk, but the heat makes it a bit harder. Once I arrived, I walked west along the beach to get to the beach with the mangroves on the other side and spent a few hours here before returning home. I arrived to the beach around 10:00am and it was getting a bit busy just as I came. There were many iguanas but not lots of sea-life (one sea lion), but I’ve heard of people seeing turtles and baby hammerhead sharks, so I think it depends on the day you go, but I’d recommend it for a nice beach day because it was lovely and the bay has calm water to swim
- In the afternoon we caught a taxi from the city centre to Rancho Primicias/the lava tunnels in Santa Rosa. Our taxi driver was awesome and recommended for us to visit Los Gemelos (sinkholes) first, then after invited us to his and his wife’s home in the highlands for a coffee and chocolate bread before taking us to the land tortoises. We had asked if Rancho El Chato or Rancho Primicias was better and he said Rancho Primicias because the Lava Tunnels on the property are much longer than the ones on El Chato Ranch (~450m in Primicias compared to 100m in El Chato). He quoted us $40 for a round trip but I’m sure you could bargain for $30. 

Day 5:
- We decided we wanted to visit Playa Garrapatero, so we rented bikes and took a taxi for $10 to the town called El Cascajo with the hopes of biking back to Puerto Ayora. After getting dropped at El cascajo we biked down the hill to the beach while seeing some giant land tortoises. When we wanted to return to El Cascajo, it was incredibly hot and a taxi happened to be by the entrance to the beach so we caught it back up with our bikes for $2.50. Unluckily, at El Cascajo my tire popped, but a friendly man in a shop nearby saw and offered us a ride to Bellavista in his fruit truck for free and there we found another friendly truck driver going to Puerto Ayora where he dropped us off by the grocery store! Just like the taxi driver the day before inviting us to his home for coffee, the friendliness of the people of the Galapagos was so welcoming!
- We went out for dinner in the evening to the Rock which was lovely.

Day 6 (Arrival to Isabela):
- We took the morning ferry to Isla Isabela and after arriving we shopped for the Tintoreras tour. We booked with “Tunel Ocean” operators and booked the tour for $40 and rented short wetsuits for $5. I’d probably recommend booking each of your tours on the island the tour will be on to receive the best prices.

Day 7:
- Snorkelled at Concha de Perla, a free site, in the morning. We brought our own snorkels from home, so we wouldn’t have to worry about renting equipment each time we wanted to snorkel. We ended up snorkelling at this site one more time and I’d recommend snorkelling in the morning because the water is more calm and it’s lower, so you can see more animals. It was great we saw a huge variety of animals here.
- In the afternoon we had our Tintoreras tour. In terms of price value, this was the best value for our dollar because we saw so many amazing animals.

Day 8:
- I walked to Poza de Los Flamingos in the morning and saw some pretty Flamingos then went and hung out at Puerto Villamil beach. 
- We went back to Concha de Perla in the afternoon and it was our second time here, but in the afternoon. The water was very rough and high because of the tide. We didn’t bother to snorkel because I read that it can be quite difficult to swim at this site when the water is like this. 

Day 9:
- Los túneles tour. It was great! We saw turtles, a variety of sharks, eels, blue-footed boobies and sea horses. 

Day 10:
- We went to Concha de Perla in the morning again and I cannot recommend this place enough. Each time we were here we saw many animals including sharks, manta rays, sting rays, turtles, sea lions and penguins. 
- After we hung out by the beach and pier to spot more animals and chill.

Day 11 (Arrival to San Cristobal):
- Took the ferry back to Santa Cruz in the morning and waited around Santa Cruz for a few hours for the afternoon ferry to San Cristobal. The waiting period was awkward, but we were able to drop our backpacks back off at the hostel we first stayed at while we walked around the town. Tip for Santa Cruz: my boyfriend was able to take out $500 at Banco Pichincha. This is good to know because the cap for taking out money at Banco Pacifico is $200 with high fees for withdrawing.
- We took the ferry to San Cristobal, checked into our AirBnb and shopped for tours. We booked a Kicker Rock snorkelling tour for $130. I wouldn’t recommend the company we went with, so I won’t mention the name. 

Day 12:
- We went to Playa Mann which was full of sea lions it was amazing. The sunset is awesome here, too. 

Day 13:
- We went on the Kicker Rock snorkel tour. The reason we chose this specific tour over the 360 tour was because I had read a few times that the 360 tour felt rushed with only 15-20 minutes to snorkel at each site around the island. After snorkelling at two sites, we were supposed to go to Cerro Brujo, which I had heard good things about and was the reason we booked this specific day instead of another day with another beach. However, we ended up at Puerto Grande anyways because the waves getting into Cerro Brujo were rough. We saw amazing wildlife on this tour like hammerhead sharks, eagle rays, Galápagos sharks, blue-footed boobies, turtles and sea lions. It was amazing.

Day 14:
- We walked to Playa Punta Carola and chilled for a bit with the sea lions and then walked to Muelle Tijeretas to snorkel. Here we saw turtles and swam with sea lions. It’s a great site for free snorkelling.
- We returned to Playa Mann in the evening to watch the sunset.

Day 15:
- Had a chill last day at Playa Mann with the sea lions. 
- Had a nice dinner in the evening at Inti Garden to celebrate the end of an amazing trip with good pizza.

Day 16:
- Walked to the airport in the morning ~20 minutes and got on our flight to leave.

Biggest recommendations: the Tintoreras, Los Túneles, and Kicker Rock tours; bringing your own snorkel to decrease the time and cost of searching for snorkel gear to rent each time you think you might go to a beach or snorkel site; and most importantly learning as much Spanish as you can before you go! It really goes a long way in booking tours, negotiating prices with taxis, and showing the locals you care about their way of life, too! Let me know if you want more information on what we did to visit the Galápagos on a budget or if you want more specific information on anything.

1l3kqv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l3kqv2/wibtah_for_potentially_making_a_friend_group/,WIBTAH for potentially making a friend group awkward by asking out a mutual friend?,"I'm going to change some minor details such as names and ages because I know some folks who use Reddit but I could use some help here navigating things, and I’ll try to keep it brief 

For context: I (M/29) recently-ish became divorced from my now-ex (F/29) of 10 years, her decision. It was formalized a little over a year ago but we had been separated for a few months prior, I had experienced a lot of emotional abuse while we were together but through therapy and finding a friend group I was able to get myself back on my feet. 

While I was getting back on my feet I used an app to find friends in my local area and I became buddies with a guy, let's call him Rich (M/30), just shy of a year ago. He had been married also for about 10 years and new to the area but had already built himself a decent circle of friends. He seemed like a cool dude. I was able to integrate well with the circle and made some very good friends but I wasn't super close to his wife, let's call her Delilah (F/30). Not because of any particular reason, in fact he'd frequently mention we had a lot in common when it came to music we liked, cooking, etc, but they usually hosted and she was typically busy playing hostess so we never got to chat much outside of a party where I got a little too intoxicated so I stayed over and me and her ended up talking about music for a long while and smoking, it was a lot of fun and we got along well.

Over the past 5 or so months he began acting increasingly erratic, and confiding in anyone who would listen about his marital problems, but as his ""designated signle guy friend"" he was overly honest, including some pretty raunchy talk. It was starting to make me uncomfortable but it sounded like they were patching things up so I figured it was just a guy gushing about his partner in a really weird way, and she was probably cool with it. It would come out much later that she definitely was not. 

Fast forward to about 3 months ago, he blindsided her with a divorce, which came as a shock to the whole group as it seemed like they'd been on much better terms lately. When I first heard about the divorce I and most in the group endeavored to stay neutral and try and stay friends with both, I reached out to both of them separately to offer support and an ear since I'd recently been in the same boat. In the process me and Delilah became good friends, we shared a lot of interests, world views, sense of humor, tastes in books, and we ended up messaging every day, sharing our experiences and keeping eachother motivated and supported (I was going through some family issues at the time and on top of the divorce he had gotten her sick with Covid).

Slowly it came out that his reasons for the divorce were becoming more cruel and self-centered and he was edged out of the group more and more until he finally ghosted the few folks who were trying to help him. The group stabilized eventually but it was pretty rocky for a while. Turns out he was kind of a creep and ALSO had a one sided crush on a mutual coworker of him and Delilah and that he was very emotionally abusive as well. 

About 2 months ago I realize I really liked Delilah, we had gotten coffee a few times after she was no longer contagious but still recovering, we were/still are messaging frequently, and just generally have good chemistry. It dawned on me one day when she made a really niche comment about swords and I sat there looking at my phone for a good 30 minutes having a mini panic attack: It was official, I definitely liked her romantically.

I responded and then messaged my older siblings for advice. I laid out that she was a really important friend to me, and that I didn't want to lose that, but that I definitely had feelings for her. I mentioned that I didn't want to rush things and had no expectations that it would be reciprocated, I wanted to know if I should tell her now, so she could decide if she wanted to stay friends and didn't think I was trying to get her to fall for me under false pretenses, or if I should hold on until she's in a better place emotionally and figured out her housing (it wasn't urgent but I knew it was stressful) and the paperwork etc went through, or if I just shouldn't say anything and work to let it go. My brother (M/40) said to tell her now and explain exactly what I had told them, my sister (F/38) said absolutely do not, and to focus on being a friend and let the crush go. They eventually agreed I should wait and see. 

A few weeks later Me and a mutual friend (let’s call her Darma) I trust very much were chatting one night and I kind of probed the idea of asking a potentially difficult question, and she just said ""You like Delilah right?"" I was kinda shocked because yes we were close but I'd been doing my best to just be friendly and platonic, but Darma’s a pretty sharp gal. I immediately apologized and let her know I had no intentions of blowing up the group again, and that I was happy having Delilah as a friend, but that yes I'd fallen for her for a while now. She told me that it wasn't anything to feel sorry for, and she could tell I had good intentions and that I would respect whatever answer she gave when the time comes, but that I was right that I should let her stabilize first and she'd probably let me know when she was ready. She also mentioned she had picked up flirty vibes from Delilah towards me, but not to read into it, and I said I had no intentions of doing so, and that she wasn't going to say anything or interfere but that she thought we could make a cute couple of it came to it. 

Around the same time during a gathering with the whole group, while Delilah was out of the room a couple of friends mentioned that Rich was an AH for almost ruining the friend group over a crush and that he should have just kept it to himself instead of damaging everyone around him being selfish.

Fast forward to now, things are going well, the friend group hangs out frequently and me and Delilah have hung out several times one on one for coffee or walks or drinks on the patio, and the crush hasn't subsided but we also have been getting more and more close, sharing personal secrets and traumas and inside jokes, we binged a adult romance series together and things have gotten flirty on occasion but I try not to read into it as she's in the process of moving so things are approaching stability but not there yet. My siblings and Darma are all still split on what I should do, and personally I feel I should wait a bit longer but I admit a part of that is nerves as well.

To wrap an overly long post up: WIBTAH if once things settle more I asked Delilah out formally, even if it potentially risks making things awkward within the group?

I do want to make it clear, whatever her response I will accept it and do my best not to make things awkward or uncomfortable for anyone, but I do feel there's a connection there and I owe it to myself to at least ask and give myself a chance.",1,1749080629.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1l3kqkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1l3kqkz/went_gf_to_manage_endo_symptoms_now_suspect_i_may/,"Went GF to manage endo symptoms, now suspect I may have Celiac. How to proceed?","TL;DR — I tried out gluten-free to help my endometriosis symptoms, after several weeks I glutened myself and experienced the worst night of my life, (stupidly) glutened myself again a few weeks later, and now I suspect I may have celiac. Is it better to stick to the GF diet before my upcoming gastroenterologist appointment, or should I go back to eating gluten to save myself from even more pain??


So I (28F) was diagnosed with endometriosis last year and got put on birth control. I didn’t notice much of an improvement in symptoms, still cramping every day, so I decided to try an anti-inflammatory diet, one trigger at a time. I cut out coffee first, didn’t notice a difference, then moved onto gluten. 

Now when I tell you the relief was IMMEDIATE. I was going from crippling pain every day to feeling back to my old self again within a week, no brain fog, no fatigue, no pain. I wasn’t super strict (still ate soy sauce, for example) or concerned about cross-contamination since I figured this is just something that made my endo symptoms worse. 

Well after about a month of GF, I was really craving McDonalds and could not get it out of my head. I caved and ate a cheeseburger and nuggets for dinner. I figured it would be fine, that maybe I’d have a bit of extra gas or bloating. It was just one meal, right?? Well, that night, around 11pm, I experienced the most excruciating pain and discomfort around my midsection. I spent 10 hours in the bathroom, never pooped so much in my life, throwing up and crying. My stomach was so raw and aching and my back was on fire, nothing would relieve the back pain. I wanted to go to the hospital, but my boss’s kids had just had norovirus the week before, so I assumed I just had a bad case of that and it would be out of my system soon enough. 

It took several days to recover from that, with the stomach and back pain lingering for a long time. I also noticed green poop for the rest of that week, suggesting my colon had been completely cleaned out. I chalked it up to norovirus. Never even considered it could be the gluten. 

Well, stupidly, I did it again. Another month passed, I was feeling great, got complacent, and ate a slice of regular pizza that my partner had gotten for dinner. I once again figured a little won’t hurt and it looked so good. Cue me waking up at 2am with the exact same symptoms again. Pain unlike anything I ever experienced before, and that’s coming from someone with a chronic illness covered head to toe in tattoos. I thought I had a high pain tolerance, but this was so bad I wanted to stop existing. 

This is when I finally considered maybe I had celiac. I previously thought I was too old to not know something like that already, and had a lot of misconceptions about what it was. After doing some research and scrolling this sub, some things are adding up. For example, I’ve had eczema since I was a teenager, and that happened to disappear when I went GF. I’ve also just struggled a lot with GI symptoms the past year or two. 

I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist, but the soonest they can get me in is mid-August. I’m assuming since I’m currently GF, I’ll need to do a gluten challenge before they can run tests. My question is, do I stay GF until that first appointment and wait to see what they say, or do I slowly reintroduce it to my diet between now and then so my gut won’t have as much time to heal and make the pain worse down the line? I’m so scared of having reactions like that again, but I really do want the diagnosis if I do have celiac. It would bring me a lot of clarity and help me feel more confident advocating for myself. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated. 🩷

I need to brew for around 20-25 people for a big (and important) event I am holding Monday. I have Rogue Wave's 'sangria washed co-ferment' that I have brewed following the Kurasu Japanese Ice Coffee method, which I have scaled up to 600g output with great success for clarity and acidity. Mix with a little honey and more ice and it's magic. I cannot be brewing live, or consistently, the coffee needs to be made ahead of time. The cups will be smaller, but I would like everybody to have a chance to have some so between 1.5L-2L total. I have a Hario switch 3, and a regular v60.

Am I biting off way more than I can chew, is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Should I make smaller batches and combine? What do you advise.",0,1749080062.0,pourover,3,0.5,False

Denny's and IHOPs are nice if they have plugs, but a lot of them got rid of those to discourage loitering. 

I normally end up with a pretty high ticket ($60-80) and tip the waiter much more than the standard 20% (normally 50-100%) since I'm there for so long. So I'm not a burden on the restaurant or staff.

The air in the new house tasted of old wood and something vaguely metallic, like forgotten pennies left too long in a forgotten drawer. Seven-year-old Maya Bennett stood in the precise center of what was meant to be her new bedroom, a tiny, bewildered figure adrift in a vast, cardboard ocean. Sunlight, thick with dancing motes of ancient dust, speared through a grimy windowpane, painting diagonal stripes across the scuffed floorboards. The window itself, tall and narrow, offered a grudging glimpse of a sprawling, overgrown backyard – a tangled wilderness that promised both the thrill of discovery and the vague menace of things unseen. Outside, the rental moving truck, a monstrous gray beast, groaned and wheezed in the driveway, its hydraulic lift hissing like a disgruntled serpent as it disgorged another pallet of their carefully packed, yet somehow already disheveled, worldly possessions. Inside, the cacophony of a family uprooted filled the void: the rhythmic thud of heavy boxes being carried, her father’s strained grunts of effort that seemed to vibrate through the very floor, and the occasional, distinctly not muffled, crash of something undoubtedly fragile, a sound that grated on Clara’s already frayed nerves.



""Maya-bug, you alright in here?"" Her dad, David Bennett, a sturdy man whose perpetually optimistic grin, even now, seemed less a genuine expression and more a desperate mask, poked his head around the doorframe. His usually neat hair was disheveled, plastered to his forehead with sweat, and a smudge of dirt adorned his cheek like a grim badge of honor. He was holding a box labeled ""KITCHEN - FRAGILE!"" upside down, a testament to the day's disarray and his dwindling energy. His eyes, though tired, held a familiar, reassuring warmth.



Maya nodded, clutching her worn teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles, so tightly that a frayed paw peeked from her grasp, a small, furry anchor in the swirling chaos. ""It's big, Daddy. Like a castle. A really, really dusty one. And it smells like… old stories.""



David chuckled, a tired but genuine sound that seemed to catch in the dry air. ""It sure is, sweet pea. Plenty of room for all your royal adventures. Just imagine the secret passages this old place must have, Maya. Hidden staircases, forgotten rooms…"" He winked, a fleeting moment of connection in the overwhelming disarray, then disappeared, his voice fading as he called out, ""Hon, have you seen the box with the coffee maker? My life force is draining faster than a leaky faucet! I might actually turn into a zombie.""



Her mom, Clara Bennett, was a whirlwind of efficiency and barely contained panic. Her usually neat ponytail had escaped its confines, and damp strands of hair clung to her flushed face. She moved from room to room with a frantic energy, directing movers with sharp, concise instructions, sealing boxes with ferocious, almost violent, slaps of packing tape, and occasionally sighing dramatically enough to inflate a hot air balloon. ""Finn! For the love of all that is holy, put your phone down and help your father with that sofa! It’s not going to move itself, no matter how hard you stare at it!"" she yelled from the bottom of the stairs, her voice echoing in the cavernous hall, a brittle sound that spoke of nerves stretched thin. Maya's fourteen-year-old brother, Finn, a lanky figure seemingly grafted to his phone, grumbled something unintelligible from behind a fortress of book boxes, his face illuminated by the faint glow of his screen. He was probably already calculating the fastest route to the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot, dreaming of escaping the manual labor and the oppressive, unfamiliar quiet that settled between bursts of activity.



Maya, however, found a strange, almost illicit comfort in the chaos. It was a new beginning, yes, a fresh canvas waiting for new colors, but it was also a place of hidden corners and echoing spaces, a place where the familiar rules seemed to bend. And besides, she wasn't alone.



""It's a bit dusty, isn't it?"" a soft voice murmured beside her, a sound like wind chimes stirred by a breath of summer air, impossibly clear amidst the distant thuds and shouts.



Maya turned, a wide smile blooming on her face, bright as a summer daisy after a morning rain. Standing gracefully amidst the cardboard jungle was Elara. She looked just like the princesses in Maya's favorite storybooks, only more real, more vibrant, as if she'd stepped directly from a dream, her presence a shimmering counterpoint to the room's drabness. Her hair was a cascade of golden waves, shimmering even in the dim light, catching the dust motes and turning them into tiny, ephemeral stars around her head. Her eyes, the color of a clear summer sky, held a gentle wisdom that belied her youthful appearance, sparkling with an inner light that seemed to banish the shadows. She wore a flowing gown, the fabric seeming to ripple with an inner luminescence, though Maya couldn't quite tell its exact color—it was always shifting, like sunlight on water, a soft iridescence of pinks, blues, and golds, never quite settling.



""Mommy says we have to clean it all up,"" Maya explained, gesturing vaguely at the room with Mr. Snuggles' paw, as if the teddy bear were a royal scepter. ""But then I can put my bed here, and my desk there, and my dolls can live in that corner! And we can have a tea party, Elara, right here! The best one ever!""



Elara knelt, her movements fluid and silent, her luminous gown not even rustling against the dusty floor. ""It will be a wonderful kingdom, Maya. A place for new stories and grand adventures. And many, many tea parties, fit for a queen."" She reached out, and her hand, warm and solid, with a touch as light as a butterfly's wing, gently brushed a stray strand of hair from Maya's eyes. To Maya, Elara was as real as Mr. Snuggles, as real as the boxes, as real as the dust motes dancing in the sunbeam. Elara smelled faintly of honeysuckle and old books, a comforting scent that was uniquely hers, a scent no one else seemed to notice.



A few minutes later, Clara, armed with a roll of packing tape and a determined expression that could fell small trees, entered Maya's room. She paused, her eyes scanning the disarray, then settling on her daughter, who was meticulously arranging a small pile of crayons on the dusty floor, seemingly talking to thin air, her lips moving in a silent, earnest conversation. The sight, though familiar, always pricked at Clara with a faint, unidentifiable unease.



""And then, Elara, we can draw the biggest rainbow ever!"" Maya chirped, holding up a vibrant purple crayon, her eyes sparkling with excitement, completely absorbed.



Clara's brow furrowed slightly, a familiar scenario playing out. Maya had had ""imaginary friends"" before, fleeting companions that vanished as quickly as they appeared, like summer clouds. But Elara had been around for a few months now, a persistent presence, almost a fixture, and Maya talked about her with such unshakeable conviction, such vivid, unwavering detail. ""Who are you talking to, sweetie?"" Clara asked, trying to sound casual, her voice a little too bright, as she started taping up a box of winter clothes, her movements a little too brisk, a little too loud.



Maya looked up, her eyes bright and guileless, completely unconcerned by her mother's implied skepticism. ""Elara! She's right here. She likes this house. She says it has good places to hide and lots of secrets."" She gestured to the empty space beside her, as if Elara were plainly visible, a solid, undeniable presence.



Clara forced a tight smile, her lips feeling stiff, a faint tremor running through her. ""Oh, Elara. Right. Well, Elara, if you're so good at helping, maybe you can help Maya find her toy box? It's probably buried under all this."" She patted a tall stack of boxes that loomed near the wall, then went back to her taping, the sound of the tape ripping a little louder than necessary, a nervous punctuation mark. It's just a phase, she told herself for the hundredth time that week, a mantra against the creeping unease. A creative, imaginative phase. All kids do it. It's perfectly normal. Perfectly.



That evening, the family settled into a semblance of domesticity, a temporary truce declared with the moving boxes. The living room, still half-filled with towering cardboard structures, boasted a temporary camp of an old blanket spread over the wooden floor, a flimsy island of comfort. A single bare bulb, hanging precariously from a frayed wire in the ceiling, cast a harsh, yellowish light, making the shadows dance in unsettling ways, twisting familiar objects into grotesque shapes. The aroma of lukewarm pizza, fished from a box that had been jostled one too many times, mingled with the lingering scent of dust, fresh paint, and the faint, sweet smell of pine cleaner, a cloying mix.



""This is the life,"" Finn muttered, still scrolling through his phone, his thumb a blur against the screen, his face illuminated by its pale glow, likely searching for the faint glimmer of a Wi-Fi signal in this digital desert. He slumped against a box labeled ""BOOKS - HEAVY,"" a sigh escaping his lips.



""It's an adventure, Finn,"" David corrected, taking a large, enthusiastic bite of pizza, cheese stretching from his mouth like a rubber band. ""Think of it as camping, but with walls and… questionable plumbing. And significantly more pizza. And less bears, hopefully.""



Maya giggled, a bright, clear sound that cut through the weary atmosphere. ""Elara thinks it's a castle! She said it has secret passages and maybe even a dragon in the attic! A friendly dragon, of course."" She picked up a slice of pepperoni pizza, carefully removing the offending meat with a delicate finger, her small nose wrinkling.



Clara exchanged a knowing glance with David, a silent message passing between them, a shared sigh of resignation: Still with the imaginary friend. At least she's eating, though, that's something. David just offered a reassuring, slightly tired smile, his eyes reflecting the bare bulb's glare, a tired flicker.



""That's nice, honey,"" Clara said, dabbing grease from her chin with a napkin. ""Maybe Elara can help you find those secret passages, after we finish unpacking. And after we've had a good night's sleep. A very long sleep.""



As Maya reached for another bite, a small, brightly colored toy car, a vibrant red sports car she’d been looking for all day, suddenly slid out from under a nearby box. It rolled smoothly across the blanket, stopping right at her bare feet, as if guided by an invisible hand, a silent, impossible ballet.



""Oh! There it is!"" Maya exclaimed, her eyes wide with delight, picking it up as if it were the most natural thing in the world. ""Thanks, Elara!"" she whispered, glancing at the empty spot next to her on the blanket, a silent nod of gratitude, a shared secret.



David, engrossed in a passionate debate with Finn about the merits of anchovies on pizza, didn't notice the toy car's convenient appearance, his attention consumed by the culinary argument. Clara, however, paused, her gaze lingering on the box the car had seemingly appeared from. Just shifted when someone bumped it, she reasoned, shaking her head slightly, trying to dismiss the oddity, the faint prickle of unease. This old house is full of surprises. Just settling, that's all. Old houses do that.



Later, after a rough attempt at organizing one of the unpacked boxes of board games, the Bennetts found themselves huddled together around a portable DVD player, its tiny screen casting flickering light onto their faces. They were watching a familiar animated movie, its cheerful soundtrack a welcome distraction from the house's persistent creaks and groans, its unsettling whispers. David had managed to find a half-inflated air mattress for himself and Clara in their makeshift bedroom, while Maya and Finn were still consigned to sleeping bags on the floor of their respective, box-filled rooms, their own small islands of temporary comfort.



""He's going to save her, right?"" Maya whispered, eyes wide and fixed on the screen, as the hero faced a formidable obstacle, a monstrous shadow creature, its animated form somehow more comforting than the unseen presences in their new home.



Clara, snuggled against David, patted Maya's head, her fingers tracing soothing circles on her scalp. ""Of course, sweet pea. That's what heroes do. They always find a way. Always.""



Just as the music swelled, preparing for the hero's triumph, the screen of the DVD player flickered violently, then went dark with an abrupt click. The sudden silence in the room was deafening, broken only by the hum of the refrigerator in the distance, a low, mechanical thrum.



""Oh, come on!"" Finn groaned, pulling out his phone, its screen a dim rectangle in the sudden gloom. ""Battery's dead. Great. Just great. Now what are we supposed to do?""



""Don't worry,"" Maya said, her voice small but certain, a quiet confidence that surprised Clara, a strange, unwavering conviction. ""Elara can help. She's good at making things work.""



A soft, almost imperceptible click sounded from the side of the room, near the wall where the power strip was plugged in. It was too quiet to be Finn, too deliberate to be an accident, too precise. The DVD player screen flickered back to life, bathing their faces in its pale glow, the hero appearing just in time to rescue the princess from the clutches of the shadow creature.



""Huh,"" David murmured, squinting at the power strip, then at the wall outlet, as if trying to decipher a complex puzzle. ""Must have been a loose connection. Good job, Elly!"" He gave Clara a pat on the arm, assuming she'd fixed it with some unseen magic. Clara just shrugged, equally perplexed but happy the movie was back on, a small knot of unease forming in her stomach, a persistent, cold pebble.



Maya, however, offered a silent, grateful smile to the shadowy space beside her. She felt a gentle warmth there, a confirmation that her friend was near, always ready to lend a hand, always watching over her.



As night truly settled in, a deep, inky blackness outside the grimy windows, Maya lay in her new sleeping bag, surrounded by the shadowy shapes of boxes and the unfamiliar creaks and groans of the old house. The wind outside sighed through the ancient eaves, making the old timbers moan like a mournful beast. A shiver ran down her spine, but it wasn't from cold. It was the feeling of being watched, a prickle on her skin, a sense of unseen eyes in the darkness.



""Are you scared, Maya?"" Elara's voice was a comforting whisper, like rustling silk, a soft melody in the darkness, cutting through the house's unsettling sounds. She was sitting on the edge of the sleeping bag, her luminous presence a soft, inviting glow in the otherwise dark room, pushing back the encroaching shadows, making them retreat from her light.



Maya shook her head, snuggling deeper into Mr. Snuggles, burying her face in his worn fur, seeking refuge in the familiar. ""No. Not with you here. You always make the scary go away.""



Elara smiled, and the light around her seemed to brighten, chasing away the deeper shadows in the corners of the room, making the outlines of the boxes softer, less menacing, almost friendly. ""This house has many stories, Maya. Old ones, and new ones waiting to be told. And soon, you will make your own. Grand, wonderful stories."" She reached out and gently stroked Maya's hair, a touch as real and reassuring as her mother's, if her mother's hands felt like warm sunlight, imbued with a strange, comforting energy.



Maya closed her eyes, a profound sense of peace settling over her, chasing away the lingering unease, the prickle of unseen eyes. She didn't know why Elara was so real to her, or why she could always make things feel better. She just knew that in this big, old, dusty house, she wasn't alone. And as she drifted off to sleep, a faint, almost imperceptible hum resonated through the floorboards, a low thrumming sound no one else in the house heard, a subtle vibration of something new awakening, something ancient stirring. The house was full of secrets, and not all of them were old.

Chapter 2: The Unseen Hand



The first week in the new house was a blur of unpacking and adjusting. Boxes slowly diminished, replaced by furniture, albeit often in the wrong rooms, leading to exasperated sighs and muttered curses from Clara. The scent of old wood began to mix with the fresh smell of furniture polish, the faint, hopeful aroma of home-cooked meals, and the lingering, almost imperceptible, scent of something else – something cold and ancient, like earth disturbed from a long sleep. Yet, amidst the settling, subtle shifts began to occur, like whispers in the quiet corners of the old house, growing louder, more insistent, more personal.



It started small, almost imperceptibly, easy to dismiss. David would swear he’d left his car keys on the entryway table, right next to the antique mirror, only to find them later, inexplicably, on the kitchen counter, nestled amongst the fruit bowl, as if placed there by an absent-minded sprite. Clara would meticulously arrange her spices in the pantry, alphabetizing them with obsessive precision, each jar a tiny soldier in a neat row, and the next morning, the cinnamon would be next to the paprika, or the salt would be on the top shelf instead of the bottom, as if a mischievous, invisible child had rearranged them in the dead of night. They dismissed it as ""moving brain fog"" or ""just getting used to the layout,"" chuckling nervously at their own forgetfulness, their explanations thin and unconvincing even to themselves. Finn, when asked if he'd moved anything, would just grunt, eyes glued to his phone, already miles away in his digital world, oblivious to the growing strangeness, wrapped in his own adolescent cocoon.



Maya, however, noticed more. She'd be playing in her room, building a magnificent castle out of colorful blocks, her concentration absolute, her small world entirely contained within the plastic bricks. When she turned her back for a moment to retrieve a specific block, a missing piece would suddenly be right where she needed it, perfectly placed within reach, as if anticipating her thought. Her favorite doll, left carefully on her bed with its porcelain face staring at the ceiling, would sometimes be found sitting upright on her desk, its tiny hands folded, its button eyes seeming to watch her, as if waiting for her to return from her brief absence. She'd whisper, ""Thanks, Elara,"" and a gentle breeze, too faint to be a draft, would ruffle her hair, carrying the faint scent of honeysuckle and a comforting warmth. Elara would often be there, a silent, shimmering presence, watching Maya with an almost knowing smile, her eyes sparkling with amusement, a secret accomplice. To Maya, it was just Elara being helpful, like always.



One Tuesday morning, Clara was in the kitchen, humming a cheerful tune as she wiped down the still-sparse countertops, the scent of lemon cleaner filling the air, a fleeting sense of domestic peace. She’d just put away the last of the breakfast dishes, closing the final drawer with a satisfying click, admiring her newfound order, a small victory in the chaos of moving. ""Alright, that's done,"" she murmured to herself, stretching her back, before turning to grab her phone from the dining room table. She took two steps out of the kitchen, her back to the pristine cabinets, a sense of accomplishment warming her.



A faint thunk made her pause. It wasn't a loud sound, but it was distinct, out of place. She turned, a casual glance, expecting to see Finn raiding the fridge, or perhaps the cat, if they had one, knocking something over. But Finn was at school, and David was at work. Her eyes widened, her breath catching in her throat, a cold knot forming in her stomach. Every single cabinet door, every single drawer in the kitchen, was wide open. They gaped like surprised mouths, revealing stacks of plates, rows of glasses, and neatly organized cutlery. It was as if an invisible hand had swept through, flinging them all open in a single, impossible instant, a silent, violent explosion of domestic order, a chaotic burst of defiance.



Clara stared, her jaw slack, a cold dread seeping into her bones, chilling her to the marrow. A chill, not from the open window, prickled her skin, raising goosebumps on her arms. ""What in the…?"" she whispered, walking slowly back into the kitchen, her steps hesitant, as if approaching something dangerous. She checked the latches, the hinges. Nothing seemed broken, no signs of forced entry, no logical explanation. She closed them all, one by one, the repeated clicks echoing unnervingly in the sudden silence, each click a punctuation mark on her growing fear, her heart thumping a little faster than usual. She told herself it was the house settling, or perhaps the old wood expanding and contracting in the morning air. But the precision of it, the sheer number of open doors and drawers, felt deliberate, malevolent, a silent taunt.



That evening, over a hastily prepared dinner of pasta, Clara recounted the incident, her voice still laced with a tremor of disbelief, her eyes wide with the memory.



""You're kidding,"" David said, pausing with a forkful of spaghetti halfway to his mouth, his eyebrows raised in skepticism, a faint smile playing on his lips, still clinging to reason. ""All of them? At once? Like a cartoon?""



""Every last one,"" Clara affirmed, shuddering slightly at the memory, a shiver running through her. ""It was… unsettling. Like the house was breathing, or watching me. And then it just… opened up. Right after I turned my back.""



Finn, surprisingly, looked up from his plate, his phone momentarily forgotten, a flicker of something akin to interest in his usually bored eyes. ""Maybe it's just the old house, Mom. You know, drafts or something. Or the foundation shifted. Old houses make weird noises.""



""Drafts don't open twenty-three cabinet doors at once, Finn,"" Clara retorted, a hint of exasperation and fear in her voice, her patience wearing thin. ""And the foundation shifting wouldn't open them all perfectly like that. It was like someone did it. On purpose.""



Maya, meanwhile, was quietly stirring her pasta, a small, secret smile playing on her lips, a private amusement. She remembered Elara had been in the kitchen with her mom that morning, complaining about how hard it was to find things in the new cupboards, how everything was hidden away. Maya had told Elara to ""just open them all up so Mommy can see!"" and giggled. She hadn't thought Elara would actually do it. Elara, unseen, was now sitting beside her, a faint, knowing twinkle in her sky-blue eyes, a silent conspirator.



The incidents escalated, growing bolder, more frequent, more personal. A few days later, David came downstairs to find the living room curtains, which had been neatly tied back with decorative tassels, now billowing wildly inwards, despite the windows being firmly shut and latched. The heavy fabric snapped and billowed as if a powerful gust of wind had swept through the room, though not a breath of air stirred. He checked the locks, then stood there, bewildered, running a hand through his hair, a growing sense of helplessness settling over him.



""Clara, come look at this!"" he called, his voice tight with a new kind of fear, a raw edge of panic.



Clara walked in, took one look at the wildly dancing curtains, and her eyes widened in disbelief. ""That's impossible. I tied those back myself this morning. Tightly. I made sure of it.""



""I know!"" David exclaimed, his voice rising in frustration, bordering on a shout. ""It's like… someone's here. Someone we can't see. Someone playing games with us. And they're not friendly games.""



Finn, who had been trying to find a comfortable spot to play his game, walked in, saw the curtains, and for once, his usual scoff was replaced by a hesitant frown, a genuine flicker of unease. ""Maybe it's just the ventilation system, Dad. Old houses are weird. They have weird air currents.""



""Our ventilation system doesn't untie knots, Finn!"" Clara shot back, her voice sharp with fear, her eyes darting around the room, searching for the unseen presence. ""And there's no wind! The windows are closed! This isn't normal, Finn!""



The most dramatic incident occurred the following Saturday. The family had decided to tackle the dining room, still a jumble of stacked boxes and dislodged furniture, a battlefield of their domestic life. David and Finn were wrestling with a heavy sideboard, its dark wood groaning under their efforts, their faces red with exertion, while Clara was attempting to dust a chandelier that looked like it hadn't seen a cloth in decades, cobwebs clinging to its crystal arms like ghostly lace. Maya was in the corner, happily doodling in a sketchbook, immersed in her own world, a small island of calm in the growing storm.



Clara needed a step stool to reach the higher branches of the chandelier. ""I'm just going to grab the small ladder from the garage,"" she announced, heading out through the back door, her voice echoing slightly in the large, empty room. David and Finn were engrossed in their struggle with the sideboard, their backs to the dining table, grunting and straining, oblivious to anything else.



A few minutes later, Clara returned, the aluminum ladder clanking softly against the wooden floor as she dragged it. She stepped into the dining room, her eyes immediately drawn to the center of the room, her breath catching in her throat. She froze, the ladder slipping from her grasp with a loud clang that reverberated through the house, a jarring sound that shattered the fragile silence.



Stacked in the middle of the dining room, perfectly balanced on top of each other, were all six of their heavy, wooden dining chairs. Not just stacked, but interlocked. The legs of one chair were threaded through the backrest of another, forming a precarious, gravity-defying tower that reached almost to the chandelier. It was a feat of impossible engineering, a surreal sculpture that defied all logic, all physics, a silent, terrifying monument to an unseen force, a deliberate act of mockery.



David and Finn, startled by the clang of the ladder, turned. Their jaws dropped in unison, their faces pale with shock, their eyes wide with disbelief.



""What… how…?"" David stammered, his voice thin, his eyes wide with disbelief, unable to comprehend the sight before him.



Finn, for once, was utterly speechless. He stared, then slowly walked around the impossible stack, poking at it with a hesitant, trembling finger, as if expecting it to crumble, to reveal the trick. ""This isn't… this isn't real. This can't be real. Who would do this?""



Clara felt a cold dread creep up her spine, a prickle of ice that spread through her entire body, making her shiver uncontrollably. This wasn't a draft, or a settling house. This was something else entirely. Something malicious. Something that wanted them to know it was there. ""It's a ghost,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible, a fragile thread of sound, a desperate attempt to name the unnameable. ""We have a ghost. A very angry one.""



Maya, who had been drawing a picture of Elara making a tower of blocks, looked up, her innocent gaze falling on the impossible stack of chairs. And then she saw Elara, standing proudly beside the impossible stack, her hands on her hips, a triumphant, almost mischievous grin on her face, her luminous form shimmering with satisfaction. Elara winked at Maya, a secret shared between them, a silent understanding.



Maya giggled, a bright, innocent sound that seemed horribly out of place in the terrified silence, a sound that only deepened the family's unease. ""Wow, Elara! That's even better than blocks!"" she whispered, then went back to her drawing, adding a tiny, perfectly balanced chair tower next to Elara in her sketch, completely unaware of the terror she had just caused, the fear she had inadvertently unleashed.



The family, however, was in a state of bewildered panic.



""We need to call someone,"" Clara insisted later that night, huddled with David on their air mattress, the makeshift bed a flimsy barrier against the encroaching fear, a thin shield against the unseen. ""An exorcist. A paranormal investigator. Someone who knows what this is! Someone who can make it stop!""



""Clara, let's not jump to conclusions,"" David said, though his voice lacked its usual conviction, a tremor of fear betraying his attempt at calm. ""There has to be a logical explanation. Maybe… maybe it's some kind of elaborate prank? You know, someone who knows we moved in and is messing with us? Finn?""



""Dad, I swear it wasn't me!"" Finn protested from his sleeping bag in the living room, where he’d opted to sleep after declaring his own room ""too creepy"" and full of ""weird vibes."" His voice was high-pitched with genuine fear. ""I don't even know how you'd do that! It's impossible! I saw it, Dad, it was just… there!""



""He's right,"" Clara said, pulling the blanket tighter around her, her body trembling uncontrollably. ""No one could do that. Those chairs are heavy. And they were perfectly balanced. It's… it's not normal. Nothing about this house is normal anymore. We can't keep pretending it is.""



David sighed, staring up at the unfamiliar ceiling, his mind racing, desperately searching for answers that wouldn't come, for a rational explanation that simply didn't exist. The house was quiet now, save for the distant hum of the refrigerator, a low, constant thrum. But the silence felt different, heavier, as if someone unseen was listening, breathing the same air, savoring their growing fear. He tried to think of a rational explanation, anything to cling to, any shred of normalcy. But the image of those chairs, defying gravity, kept flashing in his mind, a terrifying loop, a testament to the impossible. He couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't alone in their new home. And they certainly weren't aware that the source of their growing unease was sleeping peacefully just down the hall, dreaming of castles and impossible towers, with her very real, very powerful imaginary friend by her side, a silent, luminous guardian.",1,1749079948.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

At the coffee shop, she told me she was leaving her husband and she asked if my husband, an attorney, could do her divorce. My husband reluctantly agreed not only to represent her, but to do so for a discount, which she did not ask for but maybe expected? We have had lunch once since coffee, my invitation. A week after, she had a small dinner party at her home, and I was disappointed to not have been invited. I learned about it from a colleague’s FB post. It bothered me a little, but most people there were single, so I shrugged it off. A few days ago, I reached out to ask how she was doing (we are on summer break so I don’t see her at work). She seemed great. The next day she rung me up and asked if I could babysit her kid next month while she has a cosmetic procedure. I was a bit hesitant because I have to visit family next month and we are not sure which week we are going. I also have two telehealth appointments that I cannot reschedule. She said she could schedule around those, so I reluctantly agreed but warned that I still have to find out from family when they want me to visit. She texted today with her appointment time and it was an hour before one of my telehealth appointments. Her procedure is three hours long. I told her it conflicted with my appt. so she suggested I do my appointment from my laptop at her house. I explained it is a personal health matter and I want to be home where I can talk privately. She said ok and changed her appointment to the next day. This works with my schedule, but I am feeling kind of used. It seems she only reaches out when she needs something, and these are not little asks. I feel if she has friends close enough to invite to dinner parties, then they could babysit for her. I have met her kid only a few times and never for more than 10 minutes. These other people have spent at least an evening around the child and probably know her kid better than I do. Would I be the asshole if I tried to schedule my family visit the week of my colleague’s appointment so I would not have to babysit? ",21,1749079900.0,AmItheAsshole,15,0.96,False

I’ve been having weird inflammatory issues for years, they say it’s gout and to stop red meat 🙄","I set the flair to Carnivore-ish but to be clear I do not (and haven't in about 1.5 years) eat any fruit or vegetables outside of pickles (no sugar) occasionally and spices in the past. I also used to have pork rinds regularly, and dairy (sour cream, cream cheese, regular cheese etc.) and diet soda/coffee; I've cut out the pork rinds/diet soda for 2 weeks now, working on the rest. I have addictive personality/mental health issues, so I've struggled a lot with going 100% strict lion diet but trying that now. 

I've been having inflammation episodes before I ever went keto or carnivore. Primarily feet but doesn't seem to present like any gout symptoms I've ever heard or read about. I've had one or two in my knees, and quite a few in my elbows that have also been like an infection (septic bursitis). 

Almost 2 weeks ago I had another one in left elbow, severe swelling and pain. Fever came on and started having heat/pressure radiate across my chest from the elbow as well so I was concerned for infection and went to get checked. Inflammation markers off the charts and crazy elevated HR/BP, also uric acid 9.5. Was given antibiotic and NSAID and sent home as fever broke. 

Follow up with PCP insists it's gout. I asked for more labs as I suspect something else going on (possible methylation or metabolic/immune issues, also have had severely low folate/elevated homocysteine). The recent incident happened 3 days after trying to eat a good bit of beef liver and eggs for food source of folate (I do not regularly eat either of those).

Has anyone had success convincing their doctor that just because uric acid is high and I eat a ton of red meat doesn't mean it's gout? I'm kind of stumped where to turn now.

Run the Nomad Income Detector™ to uncover Your Nomadic Income profile [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

You’ve heard the stories—people making six figures while sipping coffee in Bali or coding in Chiang Mai. But here’s the unfiltered truth: most digital nomads aren’t swimming in cash. They’re working hard, hustling smart, and surviving on a budget. The highest paying jobs don’t just appear—they’re earned.

Passive income myths sell dreams, not realities. Blogs, affiliate links, and side hustles take years to scale. If you’re looking for instant wealth, you’ll be disappointed. Real money comes from skill, strategy, and sometimes, sheer stubbornness.

🌍 Ready to find your highest earning path? Let’s get started: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Tech roles dominate the top of the pay scale. Software developers, DevOps engineers, and cybersecurity experts are among the highest paid in the remote workforce. These jobs require deep technical knowledge and often come with full-time salaries that rival local markets.

Why do they pay so well? Because tech is in demand everywhere. Companies need people who can build systems, secure data, and keep infrastructure running. And they’re willing to pay for it—even if those people work from a beach.

Consulting and freelance expertise are also high earners—if you know how to position yourself. Marketing gurus, finance whizzes, and business strategists charge premium rates when they have proven results. But this isn’t about showing up; it’s about building authority.

You don’t just offer services—you offer solutions. That means knowing your niche inside out and delivering value that clients can’t ignore. It’s not easy, but the rewards are substantial.

Remote executive positions like CTOs, product managers, and directors are rising in popularity. These roles allow leaders to manage teams without ever stepping into an office. But they also require experience, leadership, and trust from stakeholders.

Managing globally dispersed teams is no small task. You need to balance time zones, cultural differences, and communication gaps. But if you can lead effectively, the compensation reflects that.

Content creation and media monetization are popular choices, but they’re far from guaranteed success. Blogging, vlogging, and podcasting can generate income through ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing. But only if you build a loyal audience over time.

Sponsored content requires relationships. Brands won’t pay unless they believe in your reach and influence. So, focus on quality over quantity. Build a following that trusts you—and then monetize it.

💡 Still unsure where you stand? Get clarity now: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Online education is booming. Teaching what you know at scale can be incredibly lucrative. Whether it’s coding, photography, or business strategy, platforms like Udemy, Teachable, and Skillshare make it easier than ever to reach global learners.

But course creation isn’t just about uploading videos. It’s about structuring a curriculum that delivers real value. People pay for results—not just information.

Investment banking and financial advisory work remotely for many professionals. Handling portfolios, advising on investments, and managing client assets can yield high returns—but it also requires strict compliance and legal oversight.

This field isn’t for everyone. It demands precision, regulatory knowledge, and often, formal qualifications. But if you have the right background, it’s one of the most profitable paths available.

Healthcare professionals are going global too. Telemedicine, online therapy, and remote nursing are growing industries. Doctors, psychologists, and nurses can serve international patients without leaving their home country.

Licensing remains a challenge. Many countries require specific certifications before you can practice. But once you clear that hurdle, the demand is strong.

So, what is the highest paying job for a digital nomad? It depends on your skills, your ambition, and your willingness to invest in yourself. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. But there are opportunities—plenty of them—for those who know how to seize them.

I am looking to send it off to some literary agents, but since they really judge by the first chapter, I thought I'd get some feedback and see if it's something presentable.

  
The synopsis: Larry is stuck in the monotous flow of life, getting angrier and angrier with the aging man in the mirror. As time goes on, Larry notices strange things happening around him that he can't explain. Reality unraveling before him until one night, an otherworldly monstrosity in the form of a giant centipede appears before him inside his apartment and speaks to him eloquently, but also haunts and terrifies him. Larry embarks on an odyssey to escape the centipede as his sanity slowly crumbles. 

  
I definitely need to work on my synopsis, but below is the first chapter. Let me know if it's something that hooks you! Thanks! :) (I copied and pasted from Reedsy so the format may have gotten messed up in the process, I need to learn how to fix that issue) 

  
Chapter I

BEEP﻿﻿ BEEP﻿ ﻿BEEP

A sound I hear more times in one hour than the years I shall live. I am a checker at the local grocery store, FreshMart, in a city south of Seattle. I slide food across a scanner for eight hours while I pretend to listen and care about the problems of every incessant customer that walks through my line every day. I try to care about their stories and try to laugh at the same joke about an unscannable item for the third time this evening, but over the last five years in this job, it has all become one redundant monochrome tunnel of routine, mediocre existence. The same songs playing on the radio, the same bitchy customers, the same annoying managers. But day by day, I find myself understanding less. I hear less, see less, smell less, everything in my sense of reality is slowly becoming a dull hum.

I used to walk in and take a deep breath of the freshly baked bread, have a bite of a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie that was soft and melted in my mouth, and listen to the hustle and bustle of the store. Now the bread has no aroma, the cookies are stale and tasteless, and I’m almost at a point of rather having ice picks shoved into my eardrums. I think maybe I need therapy, but that is only for the well off. So instead, I buy my beer and my cigarettes once my late night shift has ended, and I stroll home to let them silence whatever feelings of dread may cloud my sight in my tiny, run down, monotone apartment.

“Are you alright, Larry?” I was brought out of a daze, remembering where I was. Still standing in my checkout line, the clock said 1:47 AM, thirteen minutes until closing. I turn my head slightly and see it is the bagger Linda who was just hired a few months ago. Short with blonde hair and freckles. She was a hard worker and often talked about moving up into a checker position, almost as if she was excited about it. She was a sweet girl, but rather naive. I guess that comes with the young age. I was naive as well when I first started seven years ago and wanted to work up to a checker position. I had dreams. Now, I don’t know what I have anymore.

When I started, I was lean with a smooth and clean face, wide eyes, and a big smile, and now I am slunched over with a rough and coarse face. Each morning, I am taken aback by the image in the mirror, slowly becoming an old and broken man in a young body. My face is gaunt and tired, looking at me from the mirror. The sides of my face show a thin and weak jaw line. My eyes are the windows to a desperate and unhappy man, sunken and drooping, seeing only their own misery. My hair is thinning, and my skin grows drier by the day. All I think about is reaching past the reflection, and squeezing the life out of that old man’s body, how dare he take my spry and my health. I should carve him up and dispose of him so no one should ever see his hideous and deathly look again.

“Yeah, I’m fine,” I repeat my rehearsed line.

“Hmph, alright. If you need anything, just talk to me.” She says.

Talk to her? That sounds like a dream. But how do you explain to someone that you are not fine? And not just not fine, but you feel the life draining from you at an expedited rate. That you are slowly becoming angrier and angrier, more and more tired, and resentful. I am still a young man, but I feel my youth being drained each day with no reward for it. How do I tell her how much I despise the aging man in the mirror, how do I tell her that I want to drain the life from him in retribution, how do I explain to her every deep, gruesome detail of my thoughts without some type of consequence?

“Larry! Come here! Quick!” I hear Linda panicking, gesturing for me to follow her.

“What? I’m in my line. I can’t just leave.”

“There’s nobody here, the store is empty, it’ll be fine. Now just come quick!”

“Alright,” I say, walking with her to the source of her alarm, “What’s wrong?” She walks me into the bathroom and points at the ground to a disgusting and frightening centipede crawling across the floor. The mere sight gave me the heebie-jeebies. “Get rid of it!” She demanded out of panic. “Alright, just go look after my line and let me know if a customer walks up.” She runs off in a flash to leave me with the nocturnal arthropod that I reluctantly approach and step on with my shoe, crunching away as my heel moves side to side to ensure the slithering menace was properly dead, making a mess on the floor. I gather paper towels and the unmarked blue cleaning spray they always have in the back, wipe up the biological mess from the floor, and toss it into the trash. Returning to my line, I see Linda there waiting with still no customers where I inform her of the liberation of the bathroom to her grateful smile. We became informed that the doors were about to be locked up, so if we wanted anything before we went home, we needed to buy it now before we left the doors.

I buy my beer, cigarettes, and pack of instant noodles from the nighttime manager, Daniel. Daniel is an alright guy; he is in his mid-thirties, square glasses, hair so perfectly combed with not one strand out of place, and the most robotically friendly voice I have ever heard. The perfect customer service voice, I was almost jealous. But as fake as his friendly attitude was toward customers, he has been a fine manager to me so far. “Goodnight, old friend!” I would hear him say to me every time as I walked out for the night, and I would give him a wave goodbye with a shallow smile, too burned out from the evening to be mutually responsive.

“I heard there was a creepy critter in the bathroom!” He says as I’m walking away. I turn around to face him and say, “Yes, its all taken care of though.”

“Oh I know, Linda told me. A centipede huh?”

“Yeah, a centipede.”

“Dreadful things of the night, they are. They have a venom that paralysis their victims. I once watched a centipede paralyze a snake.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Oh yes, after it paralyzed him, he began to eat the snake’s face. And the snake is alive the entire time it’s being eaten. But the poor guy can’t do anything about it. He knows it’s happening, he wants to fight back, but he simply just cannot. He lays there, being consumed.” He says to me, nonchalantly, as if he didn’t just say one of the most horrifying things I’ve heard in a while.

“That sounds… terrible,” I reply.

“Absolutely, it’s a terrible thing to have your final thought being how your life was nothing more than this creature’s dinner.” He stops, there is a moment of silence, but his grin never ceases. Is this what floats around in his head all night? I don’t think I’d be smiling all the damn time if those were my thoughts.

“Okay, well, goodnight, Daniel,” I say, breaking the silence.

“Goodnight, Larry!” I hear as I walk towards the front door.

The night is pitch black beside the light posts in the parking lot. The air is muggy and dreadful, we are going through a terrible heat wave, and the humidity made me sticky and miserable. The only relief was from the cold perspiration I could feel from the necks of the beer bottles that I had huddled in my left arm like a mother holding her newborn baby. It is quiet and it is empty, not a car on the road, and only two other cars are left by the back doors that belong to Linda and Daniel. I stop to get my keys out of my pocket, setting my groceries on top of the car as I go to unlock the door, but I freeze. You know that horrible feeling when you swear you are being watched? That deep sense of foreboding when you are walking alone in some desolate area and find a house that perhaps you shouldn’t have found? Or waking up at night and you definitely don’t feel alone when you should? The sense of panic that cries DANGER! DANGER! LEAVE NOW! Your hands sweat, you get a chill down your spine, and you are absolutely sure that if you do not leave this place, that you will be a victim of an unspeakable and unimaginable horror? That feeling has been slowly and slowly increasing recently, and I cannot shake it. I look over my car and at the unlit lot next toFreshMartand I can feel it, I know. There is something there. It is watching me and getting closer. It is getting closer every night. I don’t know what it is but I know it wants me, I know it is inevitable. I get in my car and switch on the radio.

“Oh baby it’s a hot one out there tonight! Hope you all have an AC unit like I do during this unrelenting heat wave. If anything, it feels like hell itself is casting judgment. So crack open a cold one, get out your fans, and lets pass the time with a classic, Don’t Fear the Reaper.”

I crank up the AC and drive down to the closest pier where I go a couple times a week to clear my mind. It is a short pier and if you move too fast when it is dark, you’ll overstep and fall right in the water. So I take my time getting down there and shine a light to watch my step. I sit, crack open a beer, light up a cigarette, and listen to the waves crash in as I drift away. Drift away… Drift away… Sometimes I think that all I have to do is step off of this pier and let the tide take me away into the vast void of the ocean, never to be seen again. Just drift away into the unknown. But I do fear the reaper.

I pull up to my apartment, turn off the engine, and I stare at the front door. I almost dread going inside every night. My apartment is small and old. When you open the front door and step on the creaky floor, the first thing you see is the living room to the right. It has a brownloveseatcouch that points to the right, away from the kitchen and stares at a TV against the wall with a coffee table in between them. On the coffee table is an ashtray that needs to be emptied, a couple of empty beer bottles, and some adult magazines. On the wall that shares the front door, there is a window whose curtains are perpetually closed. To the left is the kitchen with a tiny table only big enough for two people. It doesn’t matter anyway- as I never use it. I always take my dinner to the coffee table and eat in front of the TV. In between the kitchen and living room is a hallway that leads down to the bathroom on the left, and the bedroom at the end.

One of the most prominent things noticed is the thick layer of dust that blankets the room, how badly the carpet needs to be vacuumed, and the cheap tattered clothes that scatter the bedroom as if a laundromat had blown up. The walls are all an off white, but rather from age than by design. The bathroom is repulsively yellowish and green mixed on the checkered tile walls with a grimy gray floor. The entire place was entirely unremarkable and rather dirty. I’ll get to it, though. Just let it be for now and I’ll clean it up tomorrow. Although that is what I said yesterday, the day before that, and last week as well.

It’s rather dark in here, but I am used to it by now that I work late evenings. Most of my time is spent alone in the dark. I’ve been doing it for a few years now. Just for now until something better comes along of course. I sit on the right side of the love seat couch, the same spot I always sit in. The spot is worn, the color faded, and there is a permanent indent where I place myself every night and drown myself for hours. The left side is still perfect, almost brand new without any fading or any dents from the weight of another human being. The only weight it receives is the weight of my glance when the weight of the drink consumes my mind.

You would think I would just get a chair, why take space when that space goes unused? Well, perhaps I’ll have company. Perhaps one day a lover. Perhaps one day I will need that empty spot on my couch. It is a hope I cling to, but right now it is just a mockery, a joke on myself. I suppose I am not completely alone, as I lay back into the cushion of the couch and pull out another cigarette from my already now half empty pack and light the end of it, injecting my lungs with nicotine, I look over and down the hallway to see him.

The apartment is advertised as a one bedroom, but it is really a two bedroom, and there is someone living in it. I have never met him nor ever seen him up close, but he merely at night opens his door ajar and stares at me through the thin opening. From afar he is pale and thin, and quite ghastly looking. He looks as though he is hiding from the reaper himself, and he is long overdue for his appointment. But I cannot get too close as when I begin to make my way down the hall, the door shuts and when I get to the end of the hall, only one bedroom door remains anymore. I do not worry too much about the man in the door, as he does nothing but stare and nothing more. I guess for now I will leave it be.

I finish my cigarette and put it out on the ashtray before getting up and going to the kitchen to make my instant noodles like every night, then I sit in front of the TV and finish my dinner with whatever may be playing at… Two? Three AM? I’m never too sure anymore what time it is, or even what day. It all blends together like the smell of cigarettes and cheap noodles in my apartment. In fact, when is the last time I’ve seen the sun? I must have seen it before I went into work last night, but by all accounts and every bit of straining to remember, I simply do not remember seeing it last night, much less the last time I had seen it.

Am I really that much in a haze? I don’t even notice when it is sunny out. I set down my now finished bowl of noodles, and stare out of the crack in my window curtains into the darkness of the streets. It is there. I see it. Hiding in the shadows. It is there, getting closer and closer. What does it want from me? I get up and look closer through the crack in the curtains without opening them further. The street lamps begin to fade, then the porch lights, then even the moon and the stars give away and I can’t see past my own reflection. There is no bit of light out there now. It is close.

There is a deep rumble, I can feel a sense of dread wash over me, a visceral sense of dread. Then a deep BOOM shakes my apartment, I feel the floor move beneath me and I fall back, covering my head and going into a fetal position until it stops. The entire apartment swings back and forth while I lay there, hoping the roof does not collapse on me. I look around as the shaking becomes increasingly aggressive, and I see my window with the curtains oscillating back and forth to reveal the thing, a dark and rather massive figure just standing at my window with its face near the glass, although all I can see is the glow of its eyes. It glows of amber. It stands and stares at me, completely unbothered by the violent seizure of the ground. Almost like it rather enjoyed watching me suffer as I lay helpless. It slowly starts to move over, almost as if it is floating in the air, as it did not turn itself at all, it maintains the same posture of staring deeply into me as it slides over out of view. The lights go out, and everything becomes deafeningly silent. The only thing I can hear is my own deep breaths, frantically going in and out, in and out, too terrified to get back up.

I look over at the window again and see the street lights are back on and I can see everyone’s porches. Everything in my being is telling me to not open that door and not go outside, but I know I have to. I have to at least check and see if my neighbors are alright. The older couple next door, the Haberfields. They are a nice couple who often smile and wave at me ever since I moved in. Mrs. Haberfield has baked me cookies for Christmas and I’ve helped Mr. Haberfield with a few chores around the yard and on his car that he has started to have trouble with doing. Lately, poor Mrs. Haberfield has been in and out of the hospital a lot with health problems, and I should check and see if everything is okay with them. I rush out of my apartment and over to theirs where I quickly bang on the door frantically. “Mr. Haberfield!” I continue to bang on the door. I see their lights turn on, and someone looks through the peephole. Mr. Haberfield angrily opens his front door and says, “Larry! What the hell is going on? Do you have any idea what time it is?”

“I-uh, no, I don’t. I was checking to see if you two were okay.”

“What?! Why wouldn’t we?!”

“The earthquake.”

“Earthquake? There wasn’t any earthquake.”

“You didn’t feel it? It knocked me to the floor, I had to wait until it was over until I could get back up.”

“If there was an earthquake that big we would have felt it, and with all my wife’s damn knickknacks, something would have broken.”

“So… You both are alright?”

“Dear lord, lay off the sauce, loser.”

The door slams shut in my face, I can’t believe it. They never acted that way toward me before. And how did they not feel that earthquake? I guess it is a bit strange that nothing was knocked over. Maybe I over exaggerated it? I didn’t mean to disturb them, I was just trying to make sure they were okay. I guess I should apologize the next time I see them.

“Larry…” I hear a whisper as I’m walking away making me freeze solid in my tracks.

“Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry” The whisper speeds up.

“You’re a fucking loser, Larry. Do everyone a favor and walk off that pier with a weight around your throat.”

I can’t even feel my heartbeat anymore, is it that thing? I slowly turn, “Larry… Larry…” I keep hearing the whisper. I look at the window and see a face, a rather obscured face, it looks like Mrs. Haberfield. Her face was pressed up against the window screen, but it was dark in the house and I could barely see her. Her eyes look sunken into her skull, leaving mostly dark concaves, I could see the faintest glow of white from wherever her eyeballs must be now. And her mouth just hangs open, her jaw slightly moving every time a whisper came through. Her face is pressed so hard against the metal screen, her pale and frail skin looks like it might just slice through. But it isn’t bothering her. She just keeps… pressing… “Larry… Come here, Larry… Come inside…” She keeps whispering. “I have something for you to do.”

I quickly turn around and head back to my apartment, slamming and locking the door on the way inside. What the hell is happening? That couldn’t have been Mrs. Haberfield. She always had a proper decorum and she certainly never used foul language. I walked backward into my apartment, trembling, staring at the door and window the entire time to ensure that whatever it was wasn’t trying to get in. Whatever that was, I don’t think it was Mrs. Haberfield. A minute passes and the fear begins to subside, my heart rate drops to a normal level, and I walk to my counter and lean over it with both of my hands, catching my breath and regaining my composure. But I am angry. I am frustrated. I just wish that whatever was happening would stop and leave me be.

Knock. Knock.

I hear knocking, but not from my front door, no, no it is coming from my bathroom.

Knock. Knock.

And it is not coming from the bathroom door either, no, as I get closer, the sound comes from glass. The thumping grows in intensity, like a persistent omen of death. I’m afraid I might know what fate awaits me beyond the event horizon. I open the door and walk in and look around, looking around to see the source of the tapping, the aging man in the mirror. He stares at me, into my soul. He sees my fear and my disappointment, and he laughs. He laughs and knocks some more. He knows what haunts my dreams, he knows the terror of my ever fading consciousness. How dare this aging man stare back at me, mocking me. I am merely 26… Or 27? Every day he steals my youth, my time runs shorter. He sees all of my moments of pain and shame, but they are nothing compared to the suffering I will soon endure when he takes my last days of youth away.

I reach into the glass and pull that disgusting aging man out of the reflection and drag him across the counter and shove his head into the corner, over and over again. He tries to fight back, but he is too weak, and I am too vengeful. I want him to suffer for what he has done to me, for what he reveals to me. I drag him down off the counter where I sit him up and grab his head, continuing my effort to plunge the corner into his temple until there is nothing left. Smash smash smash, I keep going, all the while his blood paints the surfaces around us. He soon stops struggling and his arms lay at his side while I get a few more bludgeons in. I let go and let his body fall to the floor while I study the now pale face and black eyes. I feel no different, no sense of satisfaction. I need to dispose of him completely, then I’ll be happy. I run over to my bedroom, open my closet, where I find a hatchet, and begin to chop away at his body. With all the power I can put into a swing, I chopped away at his arms, at his legs, at his torso, at his-

“Larry!”

I am at my checkout line, at work in my uniform. I don’t remember coming into work. I don’t know why I am here. “Larry, you seem really out of it today. Are you sure you’re okay?”

“Yes. Thank you, Linda.”

“Alright well, it’s about closing time if you are ready.”

“Yes. Yes, I’m ready.”

What happened last night? Did I kill someone? No, it was obviously a nightmare. But it seemed so real. The feeling of the blood splattering on my hands, the grip of the hatchet, and the excitement of it all. I’ll see when I get home and everything will be fine, I’m just having a bad week, that’s all. It will get better soon and things will start looking up, it has to I’m sure of it. I grab my beer, cigarettes, and pack of instant noodles as usual, go through Linda’s line, and leave the store. I slowly make my way to my car, huddling my arms together as it is freezing. When did it get cold? It feels like winter already. Wasn’t it just summer? Weren’t we just in a heat wave? I get in my car, crack open my first beer, and switch on my radio.

“Oh baby it is a cold one out there tonight! It feels like hell itself is passing judgment. Make sure you’re bundling up and blasting that heat because it is below freezing temperatures and looks like it is here to stay for a while. So warm up with a coffee, a hot cocoa, or crack open a beer if you’re some loser named Larry, and let’s pass the time with a classic, Don’t Fear the Reaper.”

What? I didn’t hear that right… Did I? There is no way I heard that right. And even if I did, it wasn’t about me. There is no way it was about me. He doesn’t know who I am. It must be some inside joke, yes, that’s what it is. If he knew me, he wouldn’t call me a loser. Or actually, if he was in his right mind, he might. It’s a coincidence, that’s all it was. Or maybe I didn’t hear it right at all. I have been tired lately. Maybe he said Jerry. My mind has been a jumbled mess lately. I don’t feel right. I don’t feel okay. Something is happening, but I don’t know what, and I don’t know what to do. Just let it be and it’ll get better, that is what I keep telling myself.

I take a sip of beer and put my car in drive, heading down to the pier again. The breeze of cold air from the sea caressed my body and strangled my joints. But I push through, and I take my normal seat at the edge of the pier and stare off into the dark abyss of the ocean. Listening to the waves crash in and out between sips from my ice cold beer. Just walk off the pier. That is all I have to do. Just close my eyes, start walking forward, and think about my favorite memory… But what is my favorite memory? Do I not have one? My life hasn’t been very exciting, but there must be one somewhere.

With another sip from the bottle, the deep taste of lager fills my mouth and quenches my sorrow. If there isn’t a memory to be had, there is the now to forget. I lower my bottle and take a drag off my cigarette. Something doesn’t feel right. I look back and realize I don’t see the beginning of the pier or my car, and normally, I could at least see its silhouette, but now, nothing. It’s gone. But not just the pier and the car, the entire world is gone. There is no more world to look at. My bottle feels different. It isn’t a bottle anymore. It’s a chain with a weight on the end, and the chain is already wrapped around my throat. I stand up, holding the weight close to my body, and I take a step forward off the pier into the abyss.",1,1749079425.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I think I see a lot of posts of people saying that they are looking to make new friends, and I am in the same boat. I moved here almost a year ago and have 0 friends despite trying lol. I'm used to having to start from scratch in new cities/places due to moving, but have never had \~this\~ slow of a success in finding community/friends. 

 I am wondering if anyone has recommendations for specific places to go or specific groups to join where you made friends? I have tried Bumble BFF... while I talked to a ton of people on there, people mostly eventually just stop responding or stop showing interest in chatting enough to actually reach the point in organizing a irl meet up, so it fizzles out. My Hinge is mostly dead also. Definitely a humbling experience!

If anyone has specific social places that they recommend for making friends that are into art, or that are outdoor or volunteer based places, or even a UU church that has a social atmosphere that you would recommend, I would love all of the recommendations! I would love to find things/groups that meet consistently or where I'm around the same group of people consistently for building a sense of community, so also open to other recommendations. Also interested in volunteering in a community garden if anyone has recs for that! I am female and in my mid twenties by the way. For fun I tend to do things like work on ceramics, read books, spend time outdoors in nature, in libraries and cute coffee shops, and am really into fashion and interior design, and would love to meet others with similar interests. Also down for any actionable recommendations for how to meet friends in this city when you know no one.

I got into making pourover coffee about 4 years ago when I was living on my own. I bought a gooseneck kettle, a filter holder, and paper filters. 

I then ended up moving back home, and my parents have a ""regular neck"" kettle. It's much bigger than my gooseneck, and they use it to make tea for all of us. They said that it's not use having two kettles on the counter, and banished mine to the basement. My mom did promise when I get an espresso machine ( I have wanted one for years) she will make room for it. Hehe.

I notice that when I make my pourover with the regular kettle, it tastes more bitter than I remember. It may be that I started sticking to dark roast coffee when I realized it's easier to digest, but I always put plenty of milk. 

Is it the kettle? Is it the fact that besides pourover, I drink cold brew and cappaccino, so the pourover seems bitter by comparison? 

Please help. It shouldn't be more bitter than drip, in my understanding. 

edit: My parents are South Asian and refuse to understand that the goose neck kettle is a different thing than the regular. I know it sounds like I'm trolling, but I'm not. Also,
it was more a ""espresso
machine or pour-over kettle"" and I chose espresso machine, which I am in the process of buying. ",1,1749079335.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

1l3k80z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1l3k80z/pvc_cured_through_sleep_position/,PVC Cured through sleep position,"I was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation a few months ago.  I would have an episode every three weeks, and stay in an arrhythmic state for about 12 hours each time.  The first time this happened was 5 years ago.  It happened on and off, but I could never get to a doctor and have an EKG while it was happening, so of course the doctors didn't believe me or called it stress or told me to drink water.  Through the years they would come and go, but I just figured it was some weird quirk of my heart.  A few months ago, they started happening more frequently, and finally I was able to get an EKG while I was having an episode, and finally the doctor's decided to take it seriously.  It seems I wasn't lying, or stressed out, but that this was a serious health concern. 

 Okay. 

 So they insisted I get an ablation.  So now you're going to burn my heart because the machine told you what I've been trying to tell you for years.  Anyway, just around this time, I started getting PVC's on top of the AFIB.  Every night when I would lie down, I would start to get skipped beats every other beat, have trouble breathing, and basically couldn't sleep laying down.  I spent about 4 nights trying to sleep sitting up.  Eventually, they went away.   told my doctor about it, and guess what?  Stress, drink more water, there's nothing we can do.  

Okay.  



I started taking my AFIB medication everyday because this seemed to stop but, but I noticed it would still come back occasionally.   I talked to the doctor, and at first he was shocked that I was taking it every day, but when I said it worked he said, ""Okay, it's fine"".  

  
Cut to a few days ago, I was searching reddit and youtube, anywhere to find a remedy for this curse, and I came across a doctor who explained that it could be a circulation problem; that our sleeping position might cut off the blood flow to our heart, and that might be what is causing the PVCs.  I noticed that I sleep in the fetal position.  I wondered if this might be blocking my circulation.  For the past 2 weeks I am PVC free, with no meds, no breathing exercises, no elevated sleeping position, no stimulation of the vagus nerve, no cessation from alcohol or coffee.  I am essentially back to my lifestyle before this cursed condition.  All I did was sleep flat.  I suspect this will cure my AFIB, but time will tell.  I have another episode due in a week or two, so we'll see.  I may have just saved myself from a dangerous and expensive procedure.  

  
The moral of this story is, there are many things that cause PVCs.  You have to try everything, even things your doctor tells you are pointless.  This one simple change in my sleeping position saved me from a life of hell.

I run 3 times a week and lift weights 4x a week. I currently weight 181 and am trying to get down to 165 and use this time to build healthier food habits and get used to smaller portions. My problem is mostly snacking so my doctor thought this would help. I’ve been on the 15mg for about a month and lost like 3 pounds then went back up to 181. I spoke to my doctor who put me on 30mg and I notice a little bit of a difference but it’s only day 3 of 30mg. Anyone else experience this? Should I just give up and switch to something else? I’ve heard phentermine work for so many people that it sucks it isn’t working for me. 

I try to eat a protein heavy diet. I cut out bread but I’m Latina so I can’t give up rice but I have less rice like maybe twice a week in small portions. I also got an air fryer recently so it’s been easier and more fun to make healthier meals like salmon, chicken, Brussel sprouts etc. I typically start my day at 5am and drink coffee and then walk on my treadmill or run 2-3 miles. I do this 3 times a week and pair it with a 10 minute or 30 minute strength class via my peloton. I take my phentermine around 7am because I noticed earlier on when I took it at 430 or 5 when I woke up, I’d be ravenous around 3 or 4 pm. I already drink a lot of water because I had kidney stones years ago. I drink about 60 to 80 oz a day. After taking my pill at 7am, I usually wait to eat around 7:50 or 8am when I get to work. I’ll have boiled eggs or mostly protein smoothies, the chobani 20g protein yogurt drink, or the fair life chocolate 40g protein drink. I eat lunch around 12 and that’s when I get a little hungry and will eat my lunch like chili or sometimes I’ll try to skip and have a few halos. When I get home I’ll make something in the air fryer. I will say the worst food I’ve made in the air fryer is lightly breaded chicken chunks with 16g protein per serving I think and then sweet potato fries but I have that as my cheat meal maybe once or twice a week and put it on a small plate so I don’t have more than I should. My snacking has gotten so much better. I will occasionally snack on dried mangos, halos or cuties, skinny pop, and thin pretzels. Idk what I’m missing here ugh. Especially because I’m getting married in 2 months and my birthday and some wedding events are in two weeks and I really want to lose even just a little before then.

I have a lot of anxiety, pretty serious depression, and do a lot of binge eating. I have been on meds for over a decade. I am at top dose and recently added Wellbutrin to help me with motivation. For the past two years I have been working a job with a ton of stress and a lot of bullies. It really started negatively impacting my mental health and I honestly some days just could not make myself go. I was made to feel bad because of the weight that I've gained since a back injury - when I couldn't do something physically, it was laziness and not wanting to contribute to the team. I tried to get accommodations for it as a disability and had a doctor's appointment scheduled for them to do my paperwork. I told our HR lady when the appointment was and then a week later she followed up asking me for the paperwork. I reminded her of when the appointment was. She said ""Well until you get that, you still need to do all of your job duties."" I replied that even with the accommodation, I wasn't requesting to not do my job duties. The next day I got fired. There's a ton more there, but I won't go into it unless someone wants to hear more. But my mental health tanked over the past year there especially. I had to text the 988 hotline at least 3 times because I was locked in my office sobbing after interactions with a coworker.  I've found another job that I'm excited about, but this other job really made me feel down about myself. I have always been really good at my job and gotten recognized on a corporate level and won awards. But I am completely unmotivated right now. I don't clean. I don't cook. I barely shower or brush my teeth. I only play games on my phone. I've become nocturnal. I have negative $'s in my bank account. I only got $300 from unemployment - when my paychecks before were $2,000. So I can't really do a whole lot like therapy or anything. People keep suggesting I take a day trip or go to a coffee shop or visit friends but I can't really afford much. I have to save the little cash I have to gas up my car to commute to my new job. I plan to do little things like sitting outside to read a book and I just can't. I have two weeks to get back to a normal sleep schedule and start functioning as a human again to do this new job, but I just feel like I'm locked in a box and will never feel a positive emotion ever again. Is it maybe the Wellbutrin? Is it just burnout? Nothing I usually do to bounce back is helping. And I'm much less able to do the things I usually do to bounce back. Any tips?

I had a massive undisclosed crush on him for years. We drifted when he went away for university, and when he returned for a visit, I was engaged to be married. He married rich and became even richer and successful on his own steam. We all got together briefly and my husband jokingly asked if he had crushed on anybody in our old friend group, and he replied he’d had a thing for me for years but was too shy and immature to do anything about it at the time. I sheepishly admitted the same and we had a good laugh all around. 

Fast forward a decade or two, and he got back in touch through messaging after his divorce. We had a nice walk down memory lane, but when he got overly flirty and flattering, I told him to cut it out, both jokingly (“my DH reads my messages so keep it clean”) and when that didn’t work, more assertively (“hey, I just want to be friends, if you keep this up I’m going to stop responding” —
and then stop for a few months). He would comply for a while until it happened again and I warned him again. This went on for years. 

I know he still finds me attractive but I assumed his flirting was meaningless reflex since he’s become quite a player, plus he seems to be in a semi-committed relationship. However, he came back to our hometown for a brief visit and we went for coffee, just he and I. It was great, we discussed philosophy and politics and work and current events and old times. But then at the end he got all choked up, and said he was full of regrets and said I was “the one who got away.” 

I can laugh / shrug off meaningless gallantry but now I’m worried he may have real feelings and I don’t want to hurt him or be disrespectful to my husband or my friend’s partner.*  I do really like him as a friend, plus he’s an
important part of my history. 

Guys here always say that men are direct and should be taken at face value, so can I believe him when he says he’s happy to be just friends?  Open to advice. 

*My husband is aware of all of this and says it’s for me to deal with. However he says I’m being a naive fool if I think my old friend is at all interested in my friendship, which I find slightly insulting. He also thinks my friend is a slimeball for hitting on a married woman, especially when he is also attached. (This is ironic coming from my husband, who started hitting on me before he broke it off with his long time partner at the time. He says this fact just proves he knows what he’s talking about.)

I’ve been dating my bf for about a year now, and our relationship is long distance. I’ve been with him in person twice, and both times were very fun, but I don’t know if my worries are due to my age or if we just aren’t compatible. 

We are both pretty hyper sexual, doing something every day or every other day, but I find myself fantasizing about other people as well. Mostly friends of ours. I feel this might be normal considering my age, but I’d like input on that. 

I also don’t really enjoy kissing. I feel like I should like it in principle, and I fantasize about it when not doing it, but while actually doing it I just find it kinda gross. Also to note that I find other things like semen gross as well. 

On the plus side, I love hanging out with him. I never get tired of him, even when what we can do is limited by our distance. The few times we have been together have been so much fun, we’ve been on dates to the zoo, bike riding around the city, a coffee date where we programmed together side by side, bars and raves and movies. We hang out online almost every day, we’ve played Minecraft and the entirety of the Halo series together. I enjoy dressing up for him, and giving him gifts. He’s made me a custom LED wood sign from one of my favourite games. 

I’ve said things to him that have made him insecure about how he looks and our relationship. I only said these things to explain how I was feeling, never to hurt him. 

There’s no way I can include every piece of context about our relationship, but I wonder if the issues I have are solvable, as I’m on a critical point where we are close to breaking up. 

Does there come a time in a relationship where you accept that it can’t be perfect, and to just enjoy the company they give you, or should you leave and try to find the perfect match?",2,1749078368.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Thankfully, I am moving from my rural hellscape for a new job, but I just felt betrayed and used by a guy online. And I forced him to tell me the truth.

So, I moved to a very, very rural place with many blank profiles on the apps. I did so for a job (I work in a niche field.) But I did find someone who a.) had a decent job (healthcare) and b.) likes bears (which I am.) And C.) seems someone normal with a good head on their shoulders. He is around my age, and we started talking and moved over texting. Things got cheeky and XXX.

I kept asking to meet up for coffee or a movie or just sex; I told him I was open to whatever. Just to meet someone. He would parry my questions often citing work and long hours as he works in hospitals as a sort of nurse. Then my life got busy. But I would invite him to places and try to plan something. He would continue to use excuses - work, it is hard for him to leave his dog if it isn't working as he's needy, etc. I continued to offer anything - coffee, movies, even going for a walk with the dog. He would often send me pics of them on walks.

As I type this, it does sound desperate, but this was over weeks. I am also in a very, very rural place for this job (IYKYK), so don't judge, you city gays.

Then I got this new job (praise the gay gods), and I told him that I still would like to meet up. He got all sad that I was leaving. I then said that he has - and has had - complete power to meet up for anything. He said it's hard actually to meet up. I called him out on his bullshit and said that if he wanted to, he would.

He then revealed the truth: he is with someone who ""allows"" him to go meet up with guys. It is a kink.

I blew up at him.

In his attempted defense, he said he didn't want me to run away. Like, dafuq? I responded along the lines of, ""So, you wanted to just keep me at a distance with hope that you'd meet up and carry out all the sexy and kind things you said?""

His partner knows what I look like. I demanded a pic of him (hardly a bear, which he said he is.) No idea if he saw the XXX pics. I have no idea what he saw in our conversations. I don't want to sound all woke academia, but I did not consent to this kink.

I mentioned this story to a handful of my gay friends elsewhere, and they were like, ""Yeah, been there in a way.""

WHY ARE WE LIKE THIS?? FOR FUCK'S SAKE. WHAT HAPPENED TO DATING? WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME IOATE OF ACTUAL NORMAL INTIMACY? I am all for kink. I am all for letting your freak flag fly. I don't need a gay guy with khakis and a Patagonia fleece vest who works in finance. But I would like to find a gay who doesn't have some 3 volume trilogy of all the fucked up things on their lives.

Why are we fucking afraid to grab a coffee or go on a walk? FFS. I am in my early, soon to be mid, 30s and feel like as I didn't get a partner before these apps ruined us, I will never find someone.",1,1749078264.0,askgaybros,0,0.67,False

1l3jvx8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3jvx8,"Met with an accident, at this location","Howdy Austin,

Hope y'all are well! 

I met with an accident (1st time since I started driving in 2018) on Ed Bluestien and the frontage road merge. Accident happened at the red circle and I was coming from QT. The other party (marked) switched lanes at the frontage road merge, and rammed their passenger side back door into my driver side fender and headlight. This happened last Thursday. There are no cameras around. The insurance is putting 100% of the liability on me, stating I failed to maintain a proper lookout, which is absolutely wrong. How should I proceed? The accident was small, but I do not want to pay higher insurance premium, and I don't want this on my record. I know it is not illegal but it's highly risky to switch lanes near merges or intersections. 

Should I challenge it or bend over?

Thanks!
