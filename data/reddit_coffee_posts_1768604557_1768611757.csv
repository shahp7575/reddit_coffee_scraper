1qeyhfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qeyhfa/aita_for_kicking_my_father_out_of_my_gallery/,AITA for kicking my father out of my gallery opening after he demanded 20% of my art sales for 'inspiring' me by calling my work 'gay little doodles' for 15 years?,"My father showed up at my gallery opening last night and told everyone I owe him for ""inspiring"" me to prove him wrong.

For fifteen years he called my paintings ""gay little doodles."" Said real men work with their hands, not paintbrushes. When I got into art school he laughed in my face and said I'd be begging to work at his construction company within a year. I worked three jobs to pay tuition because he refused to help with a single dollar. Told my younger brother right in front of me that at least he had one son who wasn't an embarrassment.

I haven't spoken to him in six years. Built my career alone. My landscapes sell for anywhere from $8k to $45k now. I own a small gallery in the arts district. Not rich, but stable. Comfortable. I did it without him.

Two weeks ago my stepmother started following my gallery's Instagram. Posted one of my pieces to her story with some bullshit caption about always believing in me and watching me grow as an artist. I never even met her until I was nineteen, and she spent exactly one Christmas with our family before I cut contact. She said my paintings would ""look cute in a coffee shop"" and asked when I was going to get a real job.

I blocked her. Didn't think much of it.

Then last night happened. My gallery was hosting a group show featuring five local artists. I had four pieces in it. Opening night, decent crowd, some wine and cheese, a few serious buyers. I was talking to a collector who'd bought from me before when I saw him walk in.

My father. In a button-down shirt I'd never seen him wear. Smiling.

My whole body went cold. He walked right up to me like nothing was wrong. Like he hadn't told me I'd never amount to anything. The collector stepped away.

""There's my son,"" he said. Loud enough for people nearby to hear. ""The artist.""

""You need to leave,"" I said.

""That's no way to greet your old man."" He was still smiling. ""I saw the article about you in the arts section last month. Very impressive. Your stepmother showed me your Instagram.""

""I don't care. Leave.""

""Look, I know we had our differences."" He lowered his voice slightly. Put his hand on my shoulder. I shoved it off. ""But I'm proud of you. I always knew you had it in you.""

I actually laughed. Couldn't help it. ""You told me I was wasting my life.""

""I was tough on you because I wanted you to succeed. And look, it worked."" He gestured around the gallery. ""You proved me wrong. That took guts. I respect that.""

People were staring now. I could feel my face burning.

""You don't get to do this,"" I said. ""You don't get to show up and pretend you supported me.""

""I'm not pretending anything. I'm saying I'm proud."" He reached into his jacket pocket. Pulled out his phone. ""Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something. Business opportunity. I've got a buddy who's renovating a hotel downtown. Needs art for all the rooms. Could be huge for you. But he'd want to work through me since I made the connection.""

And there it was.

""Get out,"" I said.

""Don't be like that. This is a good opportunity. We could work together. Make some real money."" He stepped closer. ""I know you've done well, but you could do better. I can help with that. All I'm asking is you cut me in on the hotel deal. Twenty percent. That's fair for the connection.""

""You want twenty percent for doing nothing.""

""I'm doing the networking. That's not nothing."" His smile was gone now. ""You know what your problem is? You're still acting like a kid. Holding grudges. I'm offering to help you expand your business and you're throwing a tantrum.""

My gallery manager was walking over. She'd seen the whole thing.

""Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave,"" she said to him.

""This is between me and my son,"" he said.

""This is my gallery,"" I said. ""And you're not welcome here.""

He looked around. Saw people watching. His face changed. Got hard.

""Fine. Be ungrateful."" He pointed at me. ""But don't come crying when your little art phase ends and you need real help. I tried. Remember that.""

He left. Walked right past my stepmother, who I hadn't even seen come in. She was standing by the door with her phone out. Recording.

She followed him out without saying a word to me.

This morning my brother texted me. Said our father is telling everyone I disrespected him at my own event after he came to support me. That I embarrassed him in public because I'm still bitter about him being honest with me when I was younger. My stepmother posted on Facebook about how heartbroken they are that I won't let go of the past and accept their love and support.

The post has 200 likes. People commenting about how sad it is when children abandon their parents. How forgiveness is important. She included a photo of one of my paintings that she must have screenshot from my website, talking about how she's followed my journey and always had faith.

My brother says I should have just talked to him privately. That making a scene at the gallery was immature. That our father is getting older and I should let it go.

But he didn't hear what our father said to me for fifteen years. He didn't pay his own way through school while our father called him a failure. He was the good son. The one who worked construction like he was supposed to.

Three of my artist friends who were at the opening have reached out to say they're glad I stood up for myself. That what he did was manipulative. But I keep thinking about all those people on my stepmother's Facebook. People who don't know the whole story. People who think I'm the problem.

My gallery manager says not to worry about it. Says anyone who matters knows the truth. But I can't shake the feeling that I handled it wrong. That I should have just ignored him. Or talked to him outside. Or something other than confronting him in front of everyone.

AITA for kicking my father out of my gallery opening when he showed up asking for money after years of mocking my career?

The winds whipped with almost religious fervor, swirling in a miasma of fog and cloud matter that spiraled around the ascendent forms that raced towards the filtered spotlight in the sky. Bloodied but resolute, a dragon soared upward, a figure with her arms spread wide gliding on these gales after it. Minmi, navigator of the Fortunate Sons, had at long last left the blighted earth beneath her. Like flares, streaks of lightning highlighted the murky, darkened clouds beneath as all was scourged by the unrelenting fury of her storms, cascading thunder drowning all but her laughter. Unsteady. Unfocused. Unrestrained, it flowed from her with euphoric jubilation in its pitch. She’d done it! She’d defeated them at last! 

“Heeheeheee~! **I WARNED YOU BRATS!!!** NEXT TIME, DON’T STEP UP TO THE QUEEN~!”

She could’ve stopped here. She knew she *should’ve*. There was a possibility Mio Sinclair’s ability would deactivate upon her defeat, making landfall… difficult. No matter. She’d figure it all out in time. For now as the elements swirled around she turned to the heavens above. It was restful here. Peaceful. Nothing but herself and the wind and the skies. If only the whole world could be like this, her personal paradise.

Minmi’s gaze narrowed, why was she-

“I respect you.” 
 
-a gout of wind from her stand was the only thing that spared her from the sharp end of a cutlass as the shape of Mio Sinclair shot past her. She gawked, then **screamed,** “HOW!?!”

But no answer came, it was as though she wasn’t even there. Looking down at her calmly from above, Mio observed the battle damaged Nujabes blur to life, with a roar working to throw it’s all into the way of Ika as she surged towards Minmi to press the assault. She took a breath. Even if it was lost on deaf ears…  “You know what you’re doing. You have some skill, you express yourself. Fighting, love, art—all of this is ‘expression.’ But I disagree with you on one thing. **I don’t believe in human kindness.** Human beings are cruel! Their kindness is hypocritical! They could turn on each other in an instant! I only believe in love!””

An opening created, her tail swirled to life behind her and then she was gone, blade raised as she shot downward. The last thing Minmi saw was that heavenly, ancient thing, swinging down at her with their blade and passion in their heart. She reached out. She screamed - and it all went black as the blade cut across her eyes. 

“You! Don’t! Love! Anything! I don’t have a damn thing left to learn from you! **I refute you, MINMIII!**”

She crashed **hard** upon the cliffs summit, a clearing atop the mine overwatching the storm she’d created the perfect place to crash land into the grass. Blood dribbled from her maw as she tried to crawl away - Mio landing at her side. She could hear the sound of footfalls, “No… **NO,** STAY AWAY FROM ME. YOU’RE THE ONE THAT RUINED EVERYTHING YOU-”

But she was wrong. 

That wasn’t Mio.

> It was his gap year. He was serious, finally making something of himself. Finally growing up into someone people could be proud of. Something he could be proud of. He just had to put down the threat himself.

Akira summoned the last of his energy to tackle Minmi, pushed forward by sheer adrenaline.

There were never any fights at school. The one he did see got both students expelled; Akira felt sick for days. But this is how you claim trophies for your team. He slammed his fists down, eliciting a coughing laugh. A laugh.

He grit his teeth and swung again, harder this time. Another laugh, the same as when she’d pretended to be his friend.

He swung and swung and swung, bile building in his stomach, vision going red. He felt sick. Sick of friends who patronized him, sick of being an also-ran, sick of himself. But you want this crashout. It’s what people remember; it’s what gets you votes; it’s hype moments and aura; it’s what people talk about over whatever sentimental slop you write; it’s what long, lonely years of highschool have led to. It’s what all the greats do, and you want them to think you’re great, so why don’t you feel great? **WHY DON’T YOU FEEL GRE-**

“AKIRA!” Ika2 finally broke her silence, holding him back. “We did it. We won.”

“She’s still laughing! We have to stop her-”

“Why do you care so much! Listen to me—she’s nobody! I like you!”

“Well, you’re cringe!” Akira blurted out.

“H-huh?” Ika stammered, confused.

Akira couldn’t stop himself, years of emotion pouring out and drowning her. “Everyone just tolerates you, and whenever you do those dumb jokes, they laugh at you, not with you! You’re never serious, so no one wants you around!”

Ika just stared at him, mouth agape as Akira panted from his outburst. Slowly, Akira could recognize himself going from a friend in her eyes to-

“I-Ika,” he begged. “I-I didn’t mean that, I swear, I’m so sorry-”

Yet, Ika tore the bits of plate armor off, ignoring him the whole time. She tore away the armor, the bandages, the bindings, all of it unravelling into useless paper as she returned to her original height. The scraps were as useless as the rest of him reaching out to stop her, to keep her, to apologize to her, but she slapped his impotent hand away.

She tore off her hairclip, glaring at him through hot tears. “If you want to make yourself miserable because you treasure everyone else’s opinion so much, leave me out of it!”

Ika threw the hairclip at him and turned away, dissipating into the wind.

Akira heard nothing but silence and Minmi’s fading rasp. Had… had it always been this quiet? He didn’t know what to feel, he didn’t know if he could feel. He turned to stare at Mio, who had watched his breakdown in silence.

""I just… I just wanted to do things right. I thought she would… I-I thought she would like that. I thought everyone would like that. Wh-Why…?"" He crumpled, sobbing into his hands. ""I thought I d-did good! I did good, didn't I?""

Mio cocked her head to the side. ""Not bad for a rookie. But did you have any fun?""

Akira stared in silence as Mio departed. In some time, maybe she'd ask him for coffee, see how he'd grown. For now, with her target blinded and bleeding to death, she'd leave him with the words she had always held close to her heart.

“If you don't love what you do, what's the point in doing it?”

The stormclouds churned beneath their vantage, distant thunder punctuating the silence. Akira’s bloodied fists balled, his breath seedy with agony. He was alone now. Behind him he could hear her last gurgling breaths, so he turned his back on his handiwork and looked out over the cliffs edge. The wind whipped at his face, the thunder dominating all sound there was…

… as down below, dimly glowing in the receding fog, he could see its glowing light.

The map awaited.

Just what was his treasure? 

Akira Seihachi did not know.

**Scenario: The Nasty Piece of Work - 4:15pm**

The room was rocking. Not nearly enough to throw you off balance, but just enough of a side-to-side sway that it was impossible not to notice. All ships, large and small, rocked unceasingly, like the ticking hand of a metronome. That was life at sea—a life that Louisiana Rain had long since grown accustomed to.

The aged sailor stood hunched over a table in the center of the ready room aboard the Fortunate Sons’ ship. He didn’t speak, but simply stood staring icily over a regional map of the Caribbean while chewing on a lit cigar. The smoke rose up and hung in the air above the room like storm clouds on the horizon. The younger man standing across the table from him had learned to recognize those signs, over a long career together.

“Wilbury,” Louis finally said, his voice steady and cold.

“Yes, sir?” The other man, Wilbury, replied.

“You and I… We’ve been through hell together. The Navy, the Heartbreakers, now the Fortunate Sons. In that time, you’ve come to know me well, haven’t you?” Louis inquired, still not looking up from the table.

“I’d say so, sir,” Wilbury responded with an affirmative nod, tending to his superior’s every word.

“Good. Then you know that I will do *anything* that it takes to ensure the success and continued wellbeing of myself and my crew. That I always have my crew’s best interests at heart, even if it means that I need to make tough decisions, and take wild, hardhearted actions,” Louis continued.

“Absolutely, sir.”

“And knowing that, you’ll still follow me and support me in that mission, no matter what?”

“Without question, sir,” Wilbury asserted. “To the ends of the Earth.”

“HAH!” Louis let out a boisterous, approving guffaw before munching on his cigar and hardening his expression once more. “That’s what I like to hear. Then go get the boys ready, son. I’m done playing around. Things are about to get rough.” Louis turned around as he concluded his mostly-rhetorical line of questioning, puffing on his cigar as he waited for Wilbury to carry out his new orders. Wilbury did just that, turning around and departing through the door, just as two other figures entered. Wilbury addressed one of them with a polite nod and address of “Captain” as his presence in the room was replaced by that of Captain Elstree and Kilroy.

“Louis. You’re already here. Excellent,” Elstree said as she announced her arrival.

“Captain,” Louis said, turning around and greeting the woman. His eyes darted to the side and fell on the other figure, an act that was followed by a slightly less enthusiastic acknowledgement of “Kilroy.”

“Well, Louis, if I know you—and I *do* know you—I suspect you’ve already begun making preparations for what I was coming here to tell you,” Elstree began with an air of authority. “The situation surrounding this treasure hunt is growing dire. Some of our opponents just managed to defeat Minmi.” Another bellow of ominous cigar smoke was Louis’s only response to that information. “We’re going to need to up our game going forward—play more aggressively—because with each passing second, our lead is slipping,” Elstree continued.

“‘Course, we’re not *totally* fucked, thanks to yours truly~. A man like me *earns* his pay. Not that I’d say no to a bonus for a job well done,” Kilroy interjected smugly. “Anyhow, finally gonna spill what you gleaned from that pickaxe I brought back or what?”

“Yes, I was just getting to that,” Elstree said, only a slight hint of irritation in her voice. “And trust me, Kilroy, you will be rewarded for your efforts in due time. *Handsomely*.” 

“Wouldn’t settle for anything less!” Kilroy chuckled, a smug glance cast at Louisiana.

“Now then, the results of my investigation.” Elstree cleared her throat and spoke with scholarly authority as she began to share what she’d learned.

“Uropeh. A gemstone similar to sapphire, and like sapphire, its primary uses are decorative—jewelry and the like. However, the gift our friend Kilroy so kindly delivered to us a few days ago was a pickaxe fashioned from it. Now, why did the inhabitants of the Gemstone City use Uropeh in such a way, rather than a hardier material more befitting of a tool? Was there some sort of hidden property that made Uropeh ideal?” Elstree explained.

“HAH!” Louis cut in with a booming laugh. “Oh they’ve got properties, alright, but I’d hardly call them hidden at this point. Just about everyone with half an interest in the City’s familiar with the weird shit these things can let loose.”

“Exactly. By now, we’re all familiar with Uropeh’s supernatural ability to emit images. Shades of the past. Memories that can interact with the physical world. And, as it turns out, manipulate the minds of those in that world as well."" The two men raised an eyebrow to the Captain as she continued, turning to Kilroy. ""Tell me, Killian, how much do you know about excavation?"" 

Kilroy stood in wide-eyed silence for a moment, eyes darting to Louisiana who responded with an equally confused shrug. ""Uhm... *should* I know anything about it?"" He chucked, pouring every ounce of charm into a smile to hopefully make up for his lack of an answer. 

Elstree smirked. ""That depends. Did you touch the axe directly?"" Kilroy's eyes furrowed before eventually shaking his head; the tool had been wrapped with both kraft paper and cloth by his contacts before he even got eyes on it. ""A shame, then. You'd have been made a master craftsman in an instant."" The Captain paused for effect, but when greeted with the same blank stares opted to extrapolate. 

""We're all familiar with the Uropeh's ability to 'recall' memories. It's thanks to that we have the King himself mingling with the general public as we speak. They project stored knowledge into the world around them, that's why we have conquistadors in a park in modern-day Honduras. it's a hell of an ability, but one that goes deeper than we initially thought."" She tossed a small orb of Uropeh to Kilroy, who caught it with casual ease. ""These projections aren't just limited to a physical presence in the real world. This 'copying' and 'replaying' of events applies directly to the mind as well."" She leaned forward, bracing herself over top of the table dramatically. ""Generations of experience and knowledge from ancient miners is beamed straight into your brain with a good enough grip on that thing. A layman becomes a master in minutes. Better than any damn education system in the world, and they've had it to themselves centuries ago."" Elstree concluded her speech and surveyed the reactions of her audience. Kilroy took a moment to analyze the implications before hurriedly tossing the gem onto the nearby table, wiping his hands with a look of worry.

“Well, that is just fascinating, Captain,” Louis finally said, “not that I see how it gets us any closer to finding this damn island.” Kilroy seemed to agree, though Elstree shook her head.

""The good doctor and I have some theories. Experiments unfortunately seem to require long-term exposure to see any definite answers, but early side effects point to some interesting possibilities. Confusion, interruptions in regular bodily functions, and memory loss being chief among them.” Kilroy pointed at the much-older Louisiana with a cheeky grin, who responded with a raised backhand as if to strike the mercenary. “That, I’d reckon, is a better start than any of our competitors, but will nonetheless take time, which is why I needed you, Louis,” Elstree said, looking at Louis with a devilish grin. “I would say it's about time you and your boys went out and… *thinned the herd*, so to speak. Our advantage is quickly eroding, we need sites of Uropeh research brought to heel.”

“**HAH!**” The room nearly shook at the laugh that erupted from Louisiana, who marched past the other two and out of the room with a renewed spring in his step. That was his Captain, alright. The only person he respected enough to serve under. Cigar smoke billowed out of Louis’s mouth as he marched down the ship’s hallway like a volcano ready to blow, a wicked sneer on his face. He had his orders now, and he was prepared to carry them out *with pleasure*. Back in the ready room, Elstree and Kilroy could only hear one, short farewell from their departed comrade, echoing coldly down the hall:

*“Aye aye, Captain.”*

**Scenario: Bajos de Haina, Dominican Republic - 2:33pm**

The open air market was bustling with mid-afternoon activity. Hundreds of people milled about the various shops, scents from dozens of different street dishes mingled and mixed in in the hot and humid air, all while thousands of pesos exchanged hands with laughs and grumbles alike. So bustling was the area that the bizarre pair of Typhon 8 operatives managed to keep a low profile amongst the dull roar of the public.

Violet huffed as she attempted to stand firm among the flowing sea of bodies. “I am failing to see the wisdom of your approach, Leach.” She shot a glare to her subordinate, the break from her concentration against the tide causing her to be gently pushed by a passing civilian. Her pupils shrank as an eye twitched. Unacceptable. With a polite clearing of her throat, she managed to keep her calm, authoritative tone. “I don’t see how we will find anything in such a mess.”

Leach, meanwhile, was leaning over a nearby sales counter with a facsimile eyebrow raised toward the sales clerk. “You sayin’ these are genuine Montecristos for twelve bucks? Now friend, y’know, I find that hard to believe–” An elbow to the hip ripped the investigator’s attention back onto his crewmate. “All in due time, Miss Trinity, ya can’t rush the process. Ya dig too hard, you find yourself in one hell of a hole, y’see.” 

Violet glared at Leach with a look of complete disbelief. She pulled the creature down to her level by his tie before addressing him. “I brought you because I trust your ability to deduce. To investigate. There are some kind of experiments being concocted on this island related to the gemstones, if our sources are correct, and thanks to that mess in St. Vincent, we are now *racing the general public* for leads.” She stepped forward, finger pointing up at the man’s face as a bewildered hand rubbed the back of his head. “I will tolerate distractions as much as I tolerate this crowd, Mr. Leach, and that tolerance is *rapidly shrinking.*”

The older looking man simply shrugged in response, gesturing to the crowd of people. “If you are after information, you go to where the people are. Route one stuff, I assure you!” He pulled a crumpled notepad from his overcoat, wielding it like a weapon. “What you call distractions, I call ‘greasing the wheels’, Miss Trinity. If you want people to talk, ya gotta start talkin’ yourself. It’s just common courtesy, y’see. And once they do, it’s all going into here–” 

The sales clerk interrupted, gesturing the small box of cigars to Leach insistantly. His eyes brightened, tucking the notepad away once again. “Oh, right, pardon me, yes I’ll take it…”

Violet rolled her eyes. While she couldn’t refute Leach’s logic, remiss to tell a detective how to detect, time was more of a factor for her than niceties. If he wanted to stick to ‘Route One’, as he called it, she would find another route. One with a much higher speed limit…

As she turned, she caught a peek of familiar faces dotted in the distant crowd. A tall puerto rican woman in a band shirt and a short, heavily-clothed almost-human with an odd gait. Her eyes narrowed before shuffling off without a word. If the Ghost Riders were on the same lead, the need to hurry was only magnified.

Leach turned, box of cheap cigars held proudly in his hands, before being stunned at the lack of Violet next to him. With a slow turn left and right not helping matters, he shrugged having done his due diligence. Time to get to work.

It felt good to finally have something to celebrate.

TD had been with Written In Salt for a while now, and to say things had been a bit rough would be an understatement. The crew had a ton of close calls, some half-victories and bitter defeats, none of which were particularly profitable for the old fashioned pirate crew. But thanks to Jam, the team’s spirits, and wallets, have never been fuller. They had made out like a bandit from that mine in St. Vincent, and thanks to Blondie finding a buyer quick and easy, the team was absolutely swimming in profit for the first time in months. And what good was a celebration without a decent spread?

Under Captain’s orders, TD had made landfall with a very simple goal: load up on good food and drink and come back in time to party. And with the serious wad of cash it had in its pocket, it didn’t intend to pull any punches. Numerous bags were slung over its shoulders and gripped in its hands, filled to bursting with every delicacy it could find. Sancocho, mofongo, an alarming amount of chicharrón, six different kinds of rum, the most indulgent chocolates and cakes in the market, TD was given a means to indulge and that’s exactly what it intended to do. 

One of its finds managed to confuse it, something it would never have expected to show up in a rural open-air market such as this. With matching gaudy logo and cutout standee in dozens of spots, there was an alarming presence of Baxter Bites in the shops, those weird snack things Jack had insisted on trying weeks ago that TD swore resembled cat food more than anything it had eaten before. It had turned up a nose to the oddly hairy suited man wandering around handing out boxes to the various vendors; some people just didn’t have any sense of taste–

TD suddenly felt its foot hit something solid and oddly undulating, sending it and its expensive cargo falling forward. A wild grasp for anything to keep it upright caught the overcoat of a kneeling shopper just to its left, the surprise weight causing them to topple backward with TD as they both landed on the ground atop one another. 

Numerous expletives roared out of TD’s mouth as he shoved the strangely heavy figure off of it. “Goddamnit! How much of the fuckin’ hallway do you need?! You that blind, you gotta lean that fuckin’ far down?!” It brushed itself off as it stood, quickly looking to gather its bags but was forced to stop. Of the bags that weren’t now a smear of various sweet and savory mush on the pavement, nearly all of them were suddenly crawling with small bugs. 

Leach stumbled to his own feet, prized box of cigars held high to avoid the impact as much as possible. An exasperated hand came down on his own head as he surveyed the damage. “Well gee, sir, that is a hell of a shame. I do apologize, really I do. Lemme help gather all this–”

“THESE YOUR BUGS?!” TD was furious. “That’s half my damn budget they’re crawling over! Disgusting..! And you’re *sorry?*” TD stepped up to the unintentional saboteur, scooping up a dripping bag of what once was Arroz con Leche. “If you don’t replace this nearly $300 of good food, you very well will be!” 

Leach, unflinching in the face of the overly aggressive figure before him, calmly tucked the cigar box under an arm and pulled out his wallet. “Well that may be a problem. See, I just spent everything I had on this here…!” The box was suddenly yanked from him, TD tossing it aside as it shook its head. Leach grumbled. “Now that was hardly called for–!” 

A distant, reverberating boom shook the stands of the marketplace, prompting gasps from the crowd that had gathered around the two. A second and third filled the dead silence that followed before the crowd erupted in a dull roar of concern. The two seasoned sailors instantly recognized the sound for what it was.

Cannonfire. Wherever it was aimed, it thankfully wasn’t here, but something was clearly happening just off the coast.

TD cursed again. “Goddamnit… Hurry up and pay me back already, I got a haul to celebrate and I’m not about to let some pile of bugs or whatever the hell that is get in the way.” It pointed out to the distance as an eyebrow raised on Leach, who began to pace.

“...a haul, you say?” Despite his usual good nature, Leach was on his last nerve. It was an honest mistake being in this person’s way, and a genuine shame that so much had gone to waste, but he didn’t take kindly to some out of control nutjob getting in his face and destroying his prized buy of the day. At this point, he’d take any reason to teach this arrogant lout a lesson. “Wouldn’t happen to be of a certain gemstone, would it?

Another boom. Members of the crowd started to run off in a panic. The tension was not lost on the pair, TD grumbling. “You want an interview with whatever that is getting closer? You have to be kidding.”

“I’m afraid not, sir. Very important business, need every lead I can get.” Leach finally broke the calm demeanor and adopted a more sturdy stance, matching TD’s aggression. “I must insist.”

TD rolled its eyes. It just wanted a nice dinner for once. “Fine.”

**Location:** An outdoor marketplace in the Dominican Republic! The area [here](https://i.imgur.com/Br2VkOn.png) is 26x42m, with each tile being 2x2m in scale. The map consists of a large number of outdoor market stalls set along a blocked-off street, with each stall consisting of simple wooden tables (on which their goods and wares are displayed) and large umbrellas for shade. A select few stalls have clothing racks in place of tables, with a wide variety of shirts on offer. The buildings lining the street are each three stories tall (roughly 10m), and their interiors are inaccessible.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponent!

**Additional Information:** A large number of shoppers are present in the market, each with 2/2/2 physicals and Jojo NPC 2 (causing them to be largely ignorant of bizarre phenomena happening around them). While they won’t actively attempt to harm or impede the players, their presence and numbers make the marketplace somewhat difficult to traverse.

The different colored stalls each have different types of items on sale, as described in the table below. There is effectively no limit to how many items the stalls have in stock.

|Stall Color|Items in Stock
|:--|:--
|White|Sells a variety of decorated ceramics and dishes, along with nice cutlery items.
|Brown|Local grocery stalls offering a variety of tropical fruits and vegetables.
|Red|Grocery stalls offering a variety of processed or handmade ingredients, such as jams and spice mixes.
|Blue|Offers a selection of tourist-y clothing items, such as T-Shirts, hats, necklaces, and bracelets.
|Purple|Sells a selection of cleaning supplies, such as spray bottles of cleaner, sponges, and latex gloves.
|Green|Offers a variety of tourist-y knick-knacks, such as keychains, cheap jewelry, and post cards.
|Orange|This stall sells a combination of items sold by all other stalls on the map; however, the items here are of lower quality, and in turn will be less effective and easier to break than those found at the other stalls.

If a player destroys or significantly damages a stall, the shopkeeper running the stall will get angry at them, and prevent them from having access to their wares for the rest of the match (even by illicit means, such as theft). Don’t bother trying to weaponize this against your opponent - the merchant will *know* it was you, and will not take kindly to it.

Shortly into his march, he was shot in the neck, head, and back. James H. Meredith, in 1962, became the first African American to attend","the University of Mississippi.

A former serviceman in the U.S. Air Force, Meredith applied and was accepted to the University of Mississippi in 1962, but his admission was revoked when the registrar learned of his race. 

A federal court ordered ""Ole Miss"" to admit him, but when he tried to register on September 20, 1962, he found the entrance to the office blocked by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett. 

On September 28, the governor was found guilty of civil contempt and was ordered to cease his interference with desegregation at the university or face arrest and a fine of $10,000 a day. Two days later, Meredith was escorted onto the Ole Miss campus by U.S. Marshals — setting off riots that resulted in the deaths of two students. He returned the next day and began classes. 

In 1963, Meredith, who was a transfer student from all-black Jackson State College, graduated with a degree in political science.

Three years later, Meredith returned to the public eye when he began his March Against Fear. On June 6, just one day into the march, he was sent to a hospital by a sniper's bullet. Other civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stokely Carmichael, arrived to continue the march on his behalf. 

It was during the March Against Fear that Carmichael, who was leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, first spoke publicly of ""Black Power"" — his concept of militant African American nationalism. 

James Meredith later recovered and rejoined the march he had originated, and on June 26 the marchers successfully reached Jackson, Mississippi.

1. Cleanse gently, but consistently
In the Caribbean, sweat is unavoidable. Many of us grew up washing our faces morning and night, but with gentle cleansers. Harsh soaps strip the skin and cause rebound oiliness. Cream or gel cleansers work best in humid climates.

2. Natural exfoliation, not over-scrubbing
Traditional exfoliation often came from nature: ground oats, sugar mixed with honey, coffee grounds, or finely blended rice. The key is gentle pressure and low frequency—usually once a week. 

3. Lightweight oils instead of heavy creams
Instead of thick lotions, many Caribbean routines rely on lightweight oils like coconut, castor (used sparingly), and sometimes olive oil—applied on damp skin. This seals in moisture without suffocating the skin in heat.

Caribbean skincare is about listening to your environment and working with it, not against it.

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:

Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1qeyc5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qeyc5d/advice_needed_my_comanager_makes_me_feel_like_im/,Advice needed: my co-manager makes me feel like I’m never enough.,"For context, we’ve known each other 10 years. In the past, I’ve looked up to her. But something has shifted. About 6 months ago, I came into 1 of 2 management positions. We were so close. But about 3 months ago, she just started to be mean. I’m 29 (f) and she’s 50 (f). We do not make commission or anything like that so this isn’t about money. She makes more than me and I fully support that. We are both managers but with different tasks. The owner is the only person above us. 
She constantly tells me that I do not do anything, I do not help with our staff, and when we were previously on the same (lower level) that I did nothing without being asked. I want to say, I am very self aware.. to a point that I hate it. 
But the thing is.. I do so much. Like a lot. We both do a lot. However, I never say that she doesn’t. I offer to help staff, they come to me (not her) for every little thing and I am always happy to help. I enjoy helping our amazing team. 

Our tasks are very different but it’s what we have agreed on. She hates doing my items and same for me. But we never have to worry about the other doing our job if we slack off, because we don’t. We both bust our ass every single day. She opens our doors each morning and I close them. However, when it’s her time to leave, she’s out. She doesn’t care if we’re struggling. But when she needs help, I come in early and stay until my time. This happens at least once a week and sometimes 5 days a week for multiple weeks in a row. As crazy as it is, I’m still happy to help because I’m a team player. 

I think she is a good person but she treats our staff like dog poop and expects top tier results. She makes people feel awful about taking off a day (wellllll in advance) for their kids birthdays or appointments. Makes people feel bad when they’ve been in the hospital. If someone is sick, she tells them they don’t look sick. If I like a staff member, she treats them worse and picks on them and will go and tell the owner things to frame that employee in a bad light. 

Most days are okay. Some are good, some are awful. She tells me that our staff hates me and doesn’t like talking to me. But.. gets mad because the staff talks to me and seeks my help. She offers my help for me (happy to help but she doesn’t ask). She never says please or thank you. She just demands “go do this” “give me that” etc. 

I recently found out that our employees don’t actually hate me.. they said they all love me and that she is the problem. They have alllllll complained that she treats them terrible. They are always way more protective when she isn’t at work. 

The problem is, I love my job. I love my company, I love my staff, I love the owner, I want to be here for a very long time.. but she makes me feel like garbage. I’m constantly romanticizing life outside of work. I’m in a happy and healthy marriage, I have a wonderful coparenting relationship with my child’s father. These are all things she doesn’t have so people think maybe she’s jealous but I don’t think she is. I don’t know if she’s just a grumpy person.. or what? The owner is usually very much on her side of opinions and will trust her more because she is the one who goes and tells the owner the bad things. (But exaggerates it ALL) and I am a very optimistic person. I see joy everywhere, I love building personal relationships. I bring my co manager coffee every morning. 

She finds a weird joy and thrill out of making people quit and cry. I genuinely do NOT want to quit. I adore my job and all that comes with it. But she causes stress on every single employee. She does her tasks well that don’t involve talking to people. She’s not evil.. she just isn’t always nice and it’s getting tiring walking behind her and putting out fires. It’s like I water the garden and she yanks the out of the soil. Maybe I am the problem and I just can’t see it. I might have a big head. Idk. I’ve always looked down on myself but I really do believe I do great at my job. I aim to go above and beyond every single day to keep things fun, functional and productive. 

Any advice? Talking to the owner won’t help. Talking to her won’t help. We’ve tried several times… nicely, yelling, everything in between. She breaks me down. :( ",1,1768611337.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

All my life I’ve been unable to stand up for myself and every time I have I’ve been shut down for doing it, so I would retreat and never do it again. I’ve always been punished for standing up to anyone at all, even if they were classmates that were my age, they’d say stuff like “you think you’re so tough, huh?”

And my parents didn’t make it any better, my father broke my spirit and beat me into submission, my mom would guilt trip me into doing what she wants, and then my family members would also guilt trip me or shut me down when I try to defend myself or explain my actions

And my friends always get so defensive whenever I have a genuine problem with them to the point where I feel like I can’t even talk to them

The only person I’m comfortable setting boundaries with is my partner because he makes it easy to just say no or say what I really feel and I really appreciate him for that.

My friend lives with me in my moms house at the moment and I’ve been getting really irritated with him

Like I said, my friends don’t make it easy either, and it’s a very complex situation because while my friend is a nice person to me, he takes care of my cat (financially) because my parents can’t afford to do anything like that, he gets me food when we’re out of food at home, and he gets me expensive things I really like

But then there’s also this side of him that just makes me so angry. I asked him to take care of our laundry this morning because I was gonna be out all day and I wouldn’t have been able to get it done since I’m visiting my grandparents

And then my dad was gonna come over to see my siblings and I

And I’m someone who doesn’t have that much energy for social interactions especially with my family because every time we see each other it’s stressful because someone always has to start some kind of argument with either me or another family member

So I’m fully drained by the time I’m free from them, to the point where I just wanna lay in my bed with my cat and do nothing for the rest of the day even if I have stuff I need to do like study and clean

Anyway, I asked him to do the laundry and he said “I didn’t sleep much”

And I just looked at him for a bit and then I just said “it’s fine”

But this made me really angry because I never ever ask him to do our chores, and when I do it’s when I really can’t, not to mention that he’s unemployed and he gets an allowance from his dad, so he has nothing to do all week every hour of the day, he’s just free all the time, I have high school to finish (he graduated last year, I’m repeating the year because my grades were terrible, but we met in school incase anyone is wondering the ages here)

And I don’t sleep much at night because I’m stressed as hell, not to mention the inability to sleep because I need time alone after such a long school day and by the time it feels enough it’s 1 am

I wake up at 5:40 am every morning, awake on nothing but fumes and coffee

What would the laundry take him? Two hours? Maximum three?? And still he didn’t get up to do it

Naturally I got angry because the day before I was also angry that he literally wasted all his money and then complained that he needs to save up his money and he can’t buy anything but then he bought an 80 bucks bottle of perfume for his FICTIONAL BOYFRIEND

He went shopping for make up and skincare for his meeting with some company boss on Sunday, and I was with him to help him

And honestly I was expecting to eat out because there’s no food at home, genuinely there’s nothing to eat, and instead of getting our food, which probably would’ve cost 50 bucks for us both

Shared and together (this is cheap where we live, and the amount of food is like 6 strips per person and a large fries +drinks)

But instead of getting us food he went and bought a perfume he won’t even use

It’s just for a fake person who doesn’t even exist

This is shit you do when you’re drowning in money, not when your allowance barely covers your monthly expenses.

Anyways, I’ve already been angry about all that

And right now he’s on call with lord knows who

Since 12 am, it’s almost 4 am

I can’t sleep

I set him a message so that I wouldn’t embarrass him in front of whoever he’s talking to

He didn’t see it

So I got up

Turned on my lamp and stormed out. And he looked at me as if he didn’t know what was wrong.

I’ve already been in a bad mood all day and all I wanted was to rest because I’m gonna hang out with my partner tomorrow morning and I need to be well rested otherwise I won’t enjoy it

And I can’t bring myself to just

Tell him to shut up and that I need to sleep

I’m so angry it’s just boiling inside me without an outlet for it and I can’t say anything because he didn’t read my message

I’m such a fucking doormat I swear I hate that about myself I can’t just say it to people in their face I can’t just set boundaries and tell people know

This is genuinely a problem for me and idk how I’m gonna solve it

And the problem is that he shuts down on me everytime I fucking communicate even tho he always asks me to “come up to him” whenever something wrong is going on, but he genuinely can’t accept whenever I’m angry with him or when I ask him not to do something as if I’m a horrible person for idk

Asking him not to slam his cabinet (it’s by accident, but it startles me and makes me anxious)

Or when I ask him to not call at an abnormal hour such as this

He shuts down and gets dry, doesn’t talk to me for days, and then comes back like nothing happened. It’s so infuriating I genuinely hate it so much

Or sometimes he says stuff like “I need this” and it’s something that’s not even that important

Like he commissioned an artist for 180 bucks to DRAW HIM AND HIS FICTIONAL BOYFRIEND dancing together. I’m genuinely baffled at how irresponsible he can be because he knows we don’t have food and we don’t have any fucking money so him and I are literally relying on his money to

Idk

FEED US?!?

And then he says stuff like “it’s not my job to pay for food in the house your parents are irresponsible” but he’s just as irresponsible with his money

Anyways that’s all

Popular UK roasters I absolutely love include Scenery, Skylark, Dark Arts, Special Guests, Kiss the Hippo, Rave. The usual suspects.

Now onto some recs for you lovely folk:

1. Zero to One: Vietnamese cafe near Spitalfields who roast on site and showcase some excellent quality Vietnamese coffee. Got me properly into pourover with their enthusiasm for sharing recipes. Anything washed to natural to funky, arabica and robusta. Wow.

2. Process: probably had my favourite beans last year from here - a watermelon coferment that was indeed quite nice. A bit more pricey but love the folk over there and the beans themselves

3. Cult: probably my favorite bean from 2024. Also pricy but excellent. Complex and clean, well executed coffees

4. Root & Branches: based in NI I believe, and shockingly good coffees. Tried them near the start of my speciality coffee journey and one of their beans lives in my head rent free.

I bonded with a girl I met a while back. And saw things that made me think she was amazing. She was obviously beautiful to me. But I saw past that, and actually ginuinely liked her for qualities I felt I saw at the time. 

We had one argument. Which I apologized for. But after that, I noticed a lot of things that were questionable to me. And lately our text conversations have been odd too - 

She texted me “Merry Christmas”. When I asked what she got, I was left on read. 

She mentioned getting coffee. I followed up, she said she’d be heading to the coffee place we had in mind to see what day works with her next week. It was closed (it really was). So she texted me while she was home. And sent a very attractive photo of her and her new dog. And a video of her dancing with her chest. Which I was surprised by. Not in a good way. I complemented her smile, said Im glad to see her happy and said good night. 

I asked about an update on meeting for coffee. She later said she’s working on a goal until the 15th. And after that she can. 

I sent a Bible verse to her. And she told me what she was reading. I asked what her thoughts were. And she said “I will share with you today. I’m doing a fasting and download and do a study on it today.” And never did. 

Days later, she indirectly asked to use my credit, to run an AirBNB. Asking if I knew anyone with good credit. And ironically offered my exact rent price to use it. Saying it would be an opportunity for passive income with other properties.I declined politely. And I followed up with a statement she made about unconditional love a while back. And asked how she was really feeling, business aside. (She has run a successful concierge business)

She texted “ Just reading I’ll respond once I’m back from dinner”. And didnt say anything that night. 

The next day she sent a voice message asking how Im doing. And called me by my nickname. Which was something actually personable. And we chatted, I showed the car Im renting, and she asked what I was renting it for. When I took a while to respond, she said “I’ll text you when I’m done at this event”

I obviously know that’s not happening. 

What is the purpose of this behavior? Is it retaliatory? Is it because she thinks I like her and trying to manipulate? Or just not opening up emotionally because she’s afraid of getting hurt? If shes just using me, and I said no to credit, why keep things open at this point? Or even respond to my text. 

Just wanted thoughts on all this. ",1,1768610874.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Use this instead,"Is it just me, or is ""data cleaning"" the absolute worst part of using AI? I had a project this week with about 600 rows of customer feedback. The goal was simple: categorize them by sentiment and extract a few key keywords for a report.

I started doing it the ""normal"" way. Open ChatGPT -> Copy row 1 -> Paste -> Copy result -> Back to sheet. I got to row 20 and realized I was going to be doing this for the next three hours. It’s 2026—we have self-driving cars, yet I’m still sitting here like a digital factory worker copy-pasting text between tabs. If you have 1,000+ rows, you basically have to give up your entire afternoon just to ""automate"" a task.

I was looking for a Python script to handle the API calls, but I honestly didn't want to spend my night debugging code. I ended up finding a tool called [Numerous](https://www.numerous.ai/?ref=n) and it’s a total lifesaver.

It basically puts ChatGPT directly inside your spreadsheet cells. You just use a formula like `=AI(""summarize this"", A2)` and drag it down the whole column.

**The two things that actually impressed me:**

1. **The =INFER function:** This is the ""magic"" part. I showed it 3 examples of how I wanted my data cleaned, highlighted them, and it taught itself how to do the other 597 rows perfectly. No complex prompting required.
2. **Batch Processing:** It handled the entire sheet in the background while I went to grab a coffee. No rate-limit errors, no crashing.

So tonight I decided to get my old order which was 5 beefy five layer burritos and 5 cups of creamy jalapeno sauce and I felt like I was 17 again. I went through the drive-thru got my bag pulled into a parking spot only to open my bag missing a creamy jalapeno sauce and also noticed the cups they used to put creamy jalapeno sauce in were only filled to the point where it would be gone with one burrito dunk/dip. I immediately turned off my car and walked in with the basically empty cups and said to the person at the counter that I was shorted a creamy jalapeno sauce and also there is not enough sauce in these can you please fill them more. The person apologized and gave me 5 absolutely full cups and luckily the person filling the cups was right in view so I could see them actually filling them. I get home and enjoy my feast of insanely high sodium junk food burritos like the 17-year-old me again. My beefy five layers and creamy jalapeno sauce tasted like heaven and if you have not had that combination you can thank me later.

1qexszr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1qexszr/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

If you’re reading this from a chilly morning in Moncton or while grabbing a coffee at the Saint John City Market, welcome. I’ve spent 15 years in iGaming industry—working for the big-name operators you see on TV and the offshore giants that run the show from places like Malta and Curacao.

2026 is the year the ""Old Guard"" of Canadian gambling finally cracked. While Ontario has its walled garden with iGaming Ontario, here in the Maritimes, we’re still in the ""Wild East."" The Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC) is trying to catch up, but let’s be real—their slot selection feels like a 2012 throwback and the ""Responsible Gambling"" limits can feel more like a nanny state than a night out.

Below is my unfiltered, Reddit-only guide to where the smart money in New Brunswick is moving this year. No corporate fluff—just the math, the payout speeds, and the ""catches"" they don't want you to find in the T&Cs.

# The 2026 New Brunswick Landscape: Why Things Changed

If you’ve been around the block, you know that for years, New Brunswickers only had two choices: the local ALC site (PlayNow/Alc.ca) or the ""Grey Market.""

In 2026, the grey market isn't so grey anymore. These brands are using SSL Encryption that rivals RBC, and their RNG (Random Number Generator) audits are handled by third-party firms like eCOGRA.

**What’s new in 2026?**

* **The Crypto Takeover:** If you’re still waiting 5 days for a wire transfer, you’re doing it wrong. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins (USDT) are now the standard for instant withdrawals.
* **AI-Driven Responsible Gambling:** The best sites now use AI to track your ""Tilt Factor."" If the software sees you chasing losses at 3 AM on a Tuesday, it’ll proactively trigger a cool-off period. It’s not just ""corporate responsibility""—it’s better for their bottom line if you don't go broke and quit forever.
* **VR Dealers:** We’re seeing the first real wave of VR-integrated tables from Evolution Gaming. You can actually ""sit"" at a Blackjack table with your Meta Quest 3 and see the cards being dealt in 3D.

# Deep Dives: The 5 Brands You Need to Know

# 1. [**Winshark**](https://securegame.click/winshark-reddit): The Data-Driven Newcomer

Winshark is the ""Silicon Valley"" of casinos. They don't just host games; they use an engine that suggests titles based on your previous Return to Player (RTP) percentages.

* **The Insider View:** They are aggressive on player acquisition right now. This means their ""loss leaders"" (the welcome bonuses) are currently way above the industry average. They want your data, and they’re willing to pay for it via high-value spins.
* **Performance Data:** Mobile stability is a 10/10. I tested this on the bus ride from Fredericton to Oromocto—zero lag even on 4G. Average RTP across their library is sitting at **96.8%**.
* **The Catch:** Their KYC (Know Your Customer) verification can be a pain if your documents aren't perfect. If your utility bill has a blurry corner, they *will* reject it. Get your docs crisp before you deposit.

# 2. [**TonyBet**](https://securegame.click/tonybet-reddit): The King of Consistency

TonyBet is the old reliable. They’ve won EGR Awards for a reason. In 2026, they are the most ""legal-feeling"" offshore site because they mirror the strict regulations of iGaming Ontario.

* **The Insider View:** Their ""Player Props"" in the sportsbook are actually better than the casino side. However, if you're a high-stakes Blackjack player, their private tables have the highest limits in the NB market.
* **Performance Data:** Payouts aren't the fastest (usually 24-48 hours), but they are 100% guaranteed. They’ve never missed a payment in my 15 years of tracking them.
* **The Catch:** The UI is... let's call it ""utilitarian."" It looks like an Excel spreadsheet from 2019. If you want flashy animations and ""gamification,"" look elsewhere.

# 3. [**Slotavader**](https://securegame.click/slotsvader-reddit): The High-Octane Alternative

This is where the Reddit crowd usually hangs out. Slotavader is built for the ""Degens"" (and I say that with love). It’s fast, loud, and focuses on Bonus-Buy games.

* **The Insider View:** They have a ""no-wagering"" loyalty tier. If you hit Level 10, the ""wagering requirements"" on your weekly cashback vanish. That is almost unheard of in the industry.
* **Performance Data:** Payouts via Crypto are essentially instant. I’ve seen transactions hit the blockchain in 4 minutes.
* **The Catch:** The site can feel ""cluttered."" There are so many pop-ups for tournaments and ""drops"" that it can be overstimulating if you just want to play a few hands of Jacks or Better.

# 4. WildTokyo: The VIP Specialist

WildTokyo uses a futuristic, neon aesthetic. It’s gorgeous, but more importantly, it has one of the best ""Shop"" systems I’ve ever seen. You earn ""coins"" for every spin, which you can trade for real cash or free spins with 0x wagering.

* **The Insider View:** Their customer support is actually human. In a world of 2026 AI chatbots, getting a real person in the chat within 60 seconds is a luxury.
* **Performance Data:** High focus on Pragmatic Play and NetEnt titles. Their ""Drops & Wins"" pots are often larger than the ALC regional jackpots.
* **The Catch:** The withdrawal limit for new players is $500 per day until you hit the first VIP tier. If you hit a $5k jackpot on day one, it’ll take you 10 days to get it all out.

# 5. [**RollingSlots**](https://securegame.click/rollingslots-reddit): The Rock 'n' Roll Classic

RollingSlots is all about the ""vibe."" It’s themed around vinyl records and rock stars, but behind the scenes, it’s a powerhouse for Live Dealer fans.

* **The Insider View:** They have a secret ""Early Access"" lobby. VIPs get to play new **Microgaming** slots 48 hours before they hit the general public.
* **Performance Data:** Excellent tablet optimization. If you like playing on an iPad while watching the hockey game, this is the smoothest experience.
* **The Catch:** Their reload bonuses often have a 45x wagering requirement. That’s a bit steep. Hot Take: Skip the reload bonuses and just play with raw cash to keep your withdrawals ""instant.""

**Step-by-Step: How to Get ""Instant Payout"" Status in 2026**

If you want your money today, you have to play the game correctly. Follow this:

1. **Use Interac or Crypto:** Credit cards are for suckers. Canadian banks (looking at you, Scotia and TD) love to block gambling transactions or treat them as ""cash advances"" with 22% interest.
2. **Verify Your Identity Immediately:** Don't wait until you win. As soon as you sign up, upload your NB Driver’s License and a PDF of your NB Power bill. This bypasses the ""pending withdrawal period.""
3. **Check the ""Restricted Games"" List:** Before you use a bonus, check which games contribute 0% to wagering. Usually, high-RTP games like *Blood Suckers* or *1429 Uncharted Seas* are excluded.
4. **Avoid the ""Cancel Withdrawal"" Trap:** Most casinos have a 24-hour ""cooling off"" where your money sits in limbo. 2026 tip: Ask live chat to ""flush"" your withdrawal manually. Many will do it if you ask nicely.

# Responsible Gambling: My Professional Advice

I've seen people lose houses, and I've seen people win life-changing money. The difference is always Bankroll Management.

* **The 1% Rule:** Never bet more than 1% of your total bankroll on a single hand or spin. If you have $100, your spins should be $1.
* **Set a Loss Limit, Not a Win Goal:** If you say ""I'll quit when I'm up $500,"" you'll likely play until you're at zero. If you say ""I'll quit if I lose $50,"" you live to play another day.
* **Use the Tools:** Every site listed here has a ""Personal Limits"" section. Use it. Lock yourself out for 24 hours after a big win. Your ""celebration bets"" are usually your worst bets.

# FAQ: People Also Ask (New Brunswick Edition)

**Q: Which online casino has the fastest withdrawal in New Brunswick?**  
  
 **A:** In 2026, **Slotavader** and **WildTokyo** lead the pack. If you use Crypto or an e-wallet like Jeton, you can see your funds in under 2 hours. Interac e-Transfers usually take 6-12 hours on these platforms.

**Q: Is it legal to play at offshore casinos in New Brunswick?**  
  
**A:** Yes. While the province only ""officially"" sanctions the ALC, there are no laws preventing residents from playing at internationally licensed sites. These sites operate in a legal ""grey area"" but are fully regulated in their home jurisdictions (like Curacao or Malta).

**Q: Do I have to pay taxes on my winnings?**  
  
**A:** Not in Canada, unless you are a ""professional gambler"" (meaning it is your primary source of income). For 99% of us, what you win is yours to keep.

**Q: How do I bypass ""pending withdrawal periods""?**  
  
**A:** The best way is to reach VIP Level 1 or use a ""Proactive KYC"" option. Sites like **Winshark** allow you to verify your identity *before* you even deposit, which often flags your account for ""express"" withdrawals.

**Q: Are 2026 online casinos rigged?**  
  
**A:** Not the ones listed here. They use **RNG (Random Number Generators)** that are audited by companies like iTech Labs. Stick to licensed brands; the ""rigged"" stories usually come from unlicensed ""ghost"" sites or players who didn't read the wagering requirements.

# Final chord

The New Brunswick online casino scene in 2026 is better than it’s ever been. We finally have access to the same high-tech features that the rest of the world enjoys.

Recently hes spooked by EVERYTHING, any sudden noise (whereas before he would sleep through a tornado I swear), the vacuum, the immersion blender (he used to sit on the cat tower behind me as I used it and watch me make meals), our coffee table makes a creaking noise when moved and hes now sus of the entire table where he usually eats his meals (away from our other cats since he has a kitten diet, and one of our elder cats will eat anything in sight and will nudge his way into the kitten food whenever he can), and now our little guy is just spooked by pretty much every little thing and is super skittish when we try to comfort him.. 

He loves going outside and being in the car but the last time we went outside and in the car he was shaking and (stress) panting.. this is completely out of nowhere and we are confused and concerned.

Warning Graphic Content below 

The Afterlife By Mekhi Murray

Chapter 1: The Bus Stop 

John Morgan is twenty-seven years old, and in the eyes of the Lord, he has failed. Is it because he doesn’t show up when people need him most? Or because he justifies himself even when he is clearly wrong? Or is it because he notices suffering and does nothing about it? Perhaps it is all of these things.

Now is it fair for John to be punished for these things? Nobody really knows, nobody really has the answers. But soon enough, John Morgan will find the answers for himself.

John Morgan is a lawyer, born and raised in Boston Massachusetts. At twenty-one, he began studying at Harvard Law School in Cambridge. He is naturally a quiet man , he prefers to stay to himself and avoid other people’s business—it’s just never been his thing to get involved in something that doesn’t concern him. He’s an exceptional lawyer, earning between $190,000- $215,000 a year.

Tuesday morning, John was leaving for work. That morning, his car was in the shop, so he walked to the bus station, the city around him buzzing with a rhythm he barely noticed.

A man stumbled on the curb, spilling groceries onto the pavement, muttering curses under his breath, and John walked past without a thought, telling himself it wasn’t his problem. Later, a coworker’s email pinged in his pocket—an error in a contract he knew would cost someone dearly—but he waited, crafting a reason in his head for why it wasn’t urgent, why someone else could deal with it, why it wasn’t really on him.

And then, on the corner near the coffee shop, a woman cried quietly, shielding her face with a worn scarf, but he kept his gaze on the bus stop ahead, as if looking at her too closely might make the city itself uncomfortable. Each step he took felt ordinary, invisible, unremarkable. Yet in that ordinary, in that invisibility, he was leaving a trail—a quiet weight pressing against the world, a mark that no one noticed, and maybe that was worse than notice, because it meant it could never be undone.

John was on the opposite side of the sidewalk from the bus stop. To get there, he had to cross the street, and at this hour, the streets were alive with cars moving far too fast, weaving through each other like predatory fish.

His phone buzzed in his pocket—a text from his brother. John barely remembered the last time they spoke. He felt a flicker of something he didn’t recognize, a shock that froze him in place.

And then, before he could even read it, a car barreled toward him at ninety miles per hour. The impact was instant and devastatingly brutal. His arms and legs exploded under the force, his bones shattering into pieces that seemed to float inside him. His insides twisted and spun as if the world itself had been liquefied, turning him into something unrecognizable. Blood filled his mouth, thick and metallic, and the taste seemed to drag him somewhere he had always ignored.

The car didn’t stop, it kept going.  As the car ran him over it crushed his throat, his hands, his knuckles. The people who watched didn’t scream—they could only stare, skin crawling at the grotesque reality of a body undone in seconds.

And yet, even in that moment of destruction, John felt nothing but the faint echo of everything he had ignored in life—the people he had turned away, the pain he had dismissed, the responsibilities he had justified. All of it pressed down on him, mingling with the physical agony.

Chapter Two: The Wages of Sin

(Romans 6:23 — “For the wages of sin is death…”)

The ambulance arrived shortly after. The two paramedics took out the stretcher and lifted John’s disfigured corpse onto it and then covered his body with a blanket. The paramedic woman had nearly thrown up at the sight of the body.

But what about John Morgan? He’s dead. But is that all? No it can’t be. There’s more isn’t there? That’s just it no one knows. That is until now.

Two hours ago John Morgan had just died moments ago. One minute John was standing in the street frozen staring at his phone. Then it went black.

Now John is floating staring at his corpse.

He starts to move up towards the sky. He sees a bright light that feels warm and familiar. It feels almost like it’s his long lost home calling for him. He feels the warmth surrounding him. He closes his eyes feeling relaxed. Then his eyes snap wide open.

All of sudden he starts to fall.

He falls slowly at first. Then faster. He is falling at lightning speed now his surroundings are nothing but flames and the metallic smell of blood. All he sees is fire, even though he’s still falling. He can’t see where but it feels hot on his bottom.

Arms start to tear through the fire. They’re long arms with sharp nails that could thinly slice a piece of skin off like a turkey on thanksgiving. The arms picked at John’s skin and tore little pieces off. He screamed loud and horrified. The long arms grabbed and tore at his clothes, ripping some of his hair.

And then finally he hits the ground.

He looks around him… all he sees is fire and torture nothing more.

John Morgan a 27 year old Lawyer from Boston Massachusetts… Is in Hell.

“ Johnathan Gregory Morgan Sent to Hell at age twenty… Twenty Seven. Reason For being sent to Hell… uh shit let’s see… ah here it is. Sin number one Not showing up when people needed him most the human chose absence over responsibility—walking past, staying silent, convincing himself it wasn’t his role. Sin number 2 Self-justification when the human was clearly wrong the human always had a reason. A mental argument. A legal defense for his own behavior, even when he knew better. And finally Sin number 3 Seeing suffering and choosing to do nothing Not causing pain—but allowing it. Witnessing it, recognizing it, and deciding it was easier not to act…. What a dick.”

John Morgan stared in horror at the… the thing that just said these words. John could only think of the only thing it could be… and that was a demon. A demon right before his eyes.

“W-what do you want from me.. I never did those things” John said to the demon.

“ It’s not up to me, it’s up to the Boss… it’s to the torture room with you… or would like to relive your death over and over?” The demon genuinely asked.

Of course John said nothing, but his eyes were wide with horror.

“Ill tell you what… since you’re a newbie I’ll let you relive your death… that’s the least worst punishment you can get around here.”

Before John could say anything the demon placed his thumb on John’s forehead.

John’s eyes rolled back until they were white like milk. He fell to the floor and his body started breaking. His arms, legs, fingers, all of them getting bent and snapped in crooked ways. His throat was crushing. His bones were so shattered they floated around inside him. His arms and legs looked like orbeez were floating around.

The pain didn’t stop… it went on… and on… and on. Hours went by… maybe days. After a while John realized there was no such thing as time in hell.

He wished he paid attention in church as a child. He wished he had not sinned. He wished for this constant agony to stop. But it didn’t.

In hell no one gives a fuck about your wishes and no one gives a fuck about your regrets. That’s just the way it is. Those are just some of the many rules of hell. John Morgan will slowly learn them one by one.

Chapter Three: Where Faces Go to Die

After the long brutal punishment the demon loses interest and leaves John to lay there defeated.

Soon John got the courage to run, he didn’t care where. He ran. He ran and he ran and ran faster with every step.

He tripped over a rock. He was in some type of tunnel. The roof of the tunnel had blood dripping down. The inside of the tunnel smelt like metal. It was that blood metal smell again but even stronger.

“Jesus Christ! I have to be dreaming!” John screamed.

The tunnel screeched… a shaky very sharp terrifying voice muttered “who speaks of Christ in the tunnel of blood” the voice says.

“I-I… don’t hurt me please” John mutters.

The tunnel laughs at first in the shaky voice… then a woman… then a man… than a child… then all of them. More laughter. Laughs and laughs. Louder and louder.

As they laughed faces formed out of the blood wall. The woman’s face started to melt, her skin melted like wax. Then her eyeballs. Her lips melted away. One by one all her facial features slowly turned to melting blood. No she he was a skeleton. A screaming skeleton. Then the man’s face did the same. Then the child. Then all the faces.

John was surrounded by multiple skeleton faces ripping through the flesh of the  blood tunnel laughing and laughing each laugh getting louder and impossibly louder. John’s ears start to bleed.

“STOP ITTTTTT!!! FOR CHRIST SAKE STOP ITT!!!!!.” John screams.

The tunnel’s laughter ends. Silence.

The tunnel speaks but this voice is different, almost more proper like.

“tsk tsk johnny boy you should know better than to say the lord’s name in vain like that”

John’s eyes snapped open. He knew this voice.

“ The fuck is wrong wit you Johnny boy I audda slap one across your head for your friggin lip of yours” the voice said.

“ Stop it.” John said.

“ What did you say to me? Don’t you talk to your- I SAID TO STOP!” John screamed, interrupting the voice.

Silence. Long silence.

Then it spoke again.

“ You finally came to visit me, son. I  always knew you would be a piece a shit just like ya old man” the voice said.

John refused to acknowledge the voice.

“Come on Johnny boy speak to your old man.. don’t… don’t make me have to put one upside your head… you remember that time I busted up your eyeball so good it looked like you had a gigantic grape on your face for weeks… good times.”

John turned around and there he was… his father. His fathers clothes are burnt and covered in blood. His father’s right eyeball is missing. All you can see inside is spongey tissue and yellow ooze inside of it. His skin on the left side of his face is being torn away by maggots. His skin is grey like a zombie. His upper lip is gone. His nose is hanging on by thread, which he adjusts every 8 seconds.

John screamed when he looked at his father.

“ I missed you son… I miss beatin the livin shit outta you… I miss hearin ya cry and scream and miss lookin at you getting bullied at school for having a fucked up face… I’ve waited a long time for this Johnny boy.”

These words are spoken by Randal “Randy” Morgan. When he was alive he owned a bar, he was your typical abusive drunk asshole. He died at 56 he had a heart attack,  the old bastard died while trying to harass a black man parking his car at a supermarket. But now Randy was in hell for being one of the devils creations instead of gods.

John ran. He ran and ran just like he would when he was child.

“JOHNNY BOY!!! YOU KNOW YOU CANT RUN FROM ME BOY!!” Randy ran after John.

John ran and ran until he couldn’t anymore… then Randy caught him.

Randy punched him straight in the jaw. He kicked John in the ribcage. He picked him up his hair and slammed his face repeatedly into the ground. John’s vision got blurry… but then he saw a sharp piece of bone next to his father’s foot.

John grabs it quickly and stabs Randy in the leg. He stabs him in the gut and slides it upward making all of Randy’s intestines and insides fall out. John yanks the knife out and starts to stab Randy in the face multiple times. John stabbed Randy in the face until his face became a pile of mushy blood that consisted of decayed skins and bones.

When he stopped his father was no more.

Decided to give it a try, took around 2 weeks from order to actually delivery. First impression after you open up the package was a massive disappointment, the bag has no valve, no roast date and just a sticker with the coffee info ( would expect more for 20$ bag of 125Grams) I said okay let's try it. Found that the coffee was roasted 1 week ago and I didn't see any degas ( the bag wasn't swollen or anything since there was no valve ) 

Did 4 coffes out the bat, 2 with V60 and 2 with chemex, used 2 grinders ( df64 with SSP burrs and kinu m47 with pourover burrs) all 4 coffees were different grind setting just to cover everything in case the grind is not on point at the first try.   Result was a very sweet cup ( honey sweet) with a bit of lime acidity, clean but also a bit of grainy berries with a hint of almost lost rose somewhere in there.  

I'm disappointed in this because I do roast my own coffee at home with sr800 and I get way better results than this with better notes and clarity/ separation.

I often buy recommend coffee already roasted just to test my skills compared to ""PROFESSIONAL"" roasters. I'm disappointed and impressed how good of results I get home.

We don't really want the sell but if an offer comes along we would consider as we are a few years from building. Today we got this offer below. My husband owns a business but I am not part of that business. The buyer doesn't know us.

""I’ve spent about 30 years leading and delivering technology work in both large and small companies.  Most recently, I ran a 1,400-person Product and Engineering organization at a public data/AI company, but have also built and ran smaller private businesses, including my own.  On a personal note, I’m moving to Missoula and planning to build a long-term home for myself, and I’d like to put as much money as possible into the build itself.  That’s what led me to the idea below.

Instead of a straight cash sale, I’d like to propose a clean, above-board trade where one of your companies purchases the Sierra property, and in exchange I provide a defined amount of hands-on leadership working directly with you across your businesses.  Clear scope, agreed value, fixed time period.

I'm not looking to run jobs or tell you how to run your companies - you've got that in spades.  Where I fit is helping expand what your businesses can do, or build new ones alongside them, by putting technical foundations under ideas you already have.  In practical terms, this might include things like:

Self-improving production systems that learn from every job. Increase output per crew by optimizing sequencing, scope, material timing.

Predictive job intelligence to anticipate rework, conflicts, change orders, margin drift before work starts.

Autonomous decision flow that can collapse RFIs, approvals, change timelines by routing decisions to the right owner immediately

Industrialized permitting automation that pre-validates submissions, models jurisdiction behavior, and makes approvals predictable

Some of this is process, but much of it is deciding what’s worth building, what isn’t, and then actually putting the right technical pieces in place. My role is to help make those calls and stay involved through delivery so it works in the real world.

Much of my thinking here comes from being on both sides of it.  I’ve built and remodeled multiple homes myself and dealt directly with subs, inspectors, permitting, schedules, and overruns.  I’ve also spent decades building large, complex systems that have to work together at scale.  Seeing these two worlds collide is what shaped what is described above.

If the property proposal itself isn’t of interest, no problem at all.  Either way, I’d still enjoy grabbing coffee in the future.

Did 4 coffes out the bat, 2 with V60 and 2 with chemex, used 2 grinders ( df64 with SSP burrs and kinu m47 with pourover burrs) all 4 coffees were different grind setting just to cover everything in case the grind is not on point at the first try.   Result was a very sweet cup ( honey sweet) with a bit of lime acidity, clean but also a bit of grainy berries with a hint of almost lost rose somewhere in there.  

I'm disappointed in this because I do roast my own coffee at home with sr800 and I get way better results than this with better notes and clarity/ separation.

I often buy recommend coffee already roasted just to test my skills compared to ""PROFESSIONAL"" roasters. I'm disappointed and impressed how good of results I get home.

Worth 24$ with shipping for 4oz? Heck No!

My 7$ a # green coffee single origin it's miles better. 

Don't trust them YouTubers and so called influencers online, maybe the coffee it's good for untrained eye. 

I wonder if other coffee shops online it's the same!

I’m a developer who moved from Canada to Europe last year, and sadly I left my gym buddies behind. Not surprisingly, my workout routine completely fell apart.

My friends and I tried everything to stay consistent, **group chats, solo habit trackers, shared spreadsheets** but nothing really stuck. Turns out I needed the accountability more than I realized. To our surprise, there wasn't anything on the market to track habits with friends.

# How it works

* Create a habit challenge (e.g. *“Daily Exercise”* or *“Read 10 pages”*) for **X days**
* Invite your friends
* When someone checks in, **everyone else gets a push notification**
* At the end, whoever has the **longest streak or most check-ins wins**

You can also see each other’s streaks and put something on the line — like **last place buying everyone coffee** or **paying for the winner’s next tub of protein**.

The *stakes* part ended up being huge for us. On our first challenge we put $20 in, and suddenly *nobody* wanted to be the one who broke their streak and owed money.

We’ve been using it for about **3 months now**, and it’s been way more effective than any solo habit tracker I’ve tried. Around New Year’s (without any promotion), I noticed a spike in downloads as people started new resolutions. It’s now at **\~75 active users** and slowly growing every day.

   ""No no, you misunderstand me. I merely wish to emphasize the difficulties in selecting and fortifying an entrenched location. The name of the game, so to speak,"" 

the man glanced around the room, nervously blinking three times. His pupils contracted to pinpricks as his gaze fastened on some distant object, far beyond the walls of the throne room. Nobody in court reacted, everybody was used to his oddities. 

""is,"" 

he continued with a firmer voice, 

""defense. We need to know and thereby react to every sight line approaching, entering, and exiting our hold. We need to know what comes up the roads and when, we need to know who travels near us and why. There's a great deal of logistical thinking that needs to go on before one can even consider strategy."" 


""You are therefore saying that it would be unwise to put the structures directly into a granite cliff seam?"" 


The man frowned in a way that made it clear he had just elaborated on the subject.


""Yes; nearly the whole area is mountainous, any assaulting force should carry hooks and rope to climb out of necessity anyway. Better to bury a fort in the flattest part of the forest and hide in the trees.""


He was a recently promoted battalion mage, corporal now, and hardly an expert on any aspects of war except wards, lightning arrays, and counter spelling, but he had gone through basic training and rucked gear through bitter conditions with the rest of them. Still, he had somehow not expected so many of a royal family and their staff to be largely ignorant of basic tactics. They had been fixated on the idea of stone rooms, dug into the sides of rock faces for a command post. “Spill a half gallon of oil in one of those,” he thought, “light it.” Besides, likely none of them had used a pickaxe before. Yes, the best thing with time to prepare would be a basic wood and clay bastion: however many sides you needed, covered and concealed entrances to sapper tunnels, and safe stores of black powder and pitch for the ground pounders, phosphorus and peat coal for he and his. The smells of battle brought Corporal Greenloe, leader of two mage lines in the ninth legion, back to the opulence of the hall. He glanced around, reading the room.



Figuring that he had spent enough time talking about the merits of a well-designed defensible avenue and the necessity of pitting flat fields, he changed tack. Let them see what the crow sees.



""The location is somewhat remote, but shortly uphill from a rather important river. The enemy knows what's in the mountains, same as us, the trick is not expending too many resources competing with them. We want a location that horses and wagons and armaments can easily enter and exit, and one that cannot be easily surrounded.""


""Which resources would that be sir?""


""Admittedly, we're going beyond the scope of my military knowledge. However, I would venture to say that the greatest resource being expended is control. The elevation of the river is too steep for regular trade, but it will always facilitate some. The proposed zone of control that we are considering is a choke point into the heart of the range, the terrain is remarkably diverse, yet mostly traversable. I think we all agree that the sheer volume of magical phenomenon and peculiarities is more than enough reason to stake a claim to it. Failing to protect such a bountiful head would restrict your ability to observe, much less control domestic situations.""


Twin smirks had briefly appeared on the faces of two important, well dressed people, in a small sea of important, well dressed people. Greenloe was an observant fellow however, and noticed that they had each asked exactly one curiously well-timed question a piece. The older man and younger woman seemed to be the tacticians. Still, that he did not know for certain, and was made to spend hours guessing and explaining, irked.


The woman seated on the most modest chair of the bunch, she was thin, in her late thirties, with dark blonde hair, and grey blue eyes, stirred. The corporal went through his mental inventory of rank and station; she was the acting queen, the one who dealt with domestic situations - aunt of the eight year old boy who would inherit power. The two military minds were an uncle and a cousin from her husband's side of the family. The boy in question was quiet, but brightly followed conversation and politely kept one of his elders from being long winded. She sat up straight, a violet and vine green dress draping itself on her shoulders, and smiled at him. 


""Mister Greenloe, you have been patient with us who are not familiar with the practicality of battle. Thank you for all your service, here and there.""


Now she looked around the room, reading it, but slower and more considerate than he had. She gave another small smile.


""Now we may not have many here who know where to put piles of dirt and barricades, however we do have a great many talented and curious practitioners of magic. We also have a great many resources, and we have long since determined to have you charged with using them in creation of a magical defense. We have been at this since mid day, for hours! Marco, fetch wine and platters please, and get the kitchen started on supper. Corporal please, sit down, if you look to your right, that woman is holding a number of documents for you to inspect. The first two are most important. One is the results of a prospecting trip we commissioned of the valley, mapping the caverns below and the cliffs above, and the tunnels that connect the whole place. The other is a complete report of our current available stockpiles of magical reagents, building materials, smelting catalysts et cetera, et cetera, for you to use in the endeavor, listed by tonnage and quality, alphabetized.""


A cup of coffee had magically appeared in her hand and she sipped it with a soft sigh. The mage’s eyebrows couldn't go any higher so he accepted the pieces of paper and parchment as he sat down. Luckily, he was reprieved of public speaking while they opened the hall and set tables for several hundred. Relaxing for the first time, Greenloe looked through the packet with the help of the woman who had given it to him - a charming in-law of the prince. He had been entirely ignorant of caverns below the battlefield, wondering if the information might have saved lives in a series of skirmishes that had most of the ninth see action. Best to put it out of mind, and focus on the defense of what he had known about: amazing magical structures that affected the environment around them. The range of brutal stone mountains in the south of the kingdom had dozens of them, and men had come to learn their secrets. Several large rivers flowed and the enormous, reality warping buildings often appeared perpendicular to bodies of water. Other than their extremely obvious and noticeable magical properties, the only thing truly observable about them, was that they were old. Corporal Greenloe had visited five of them thus far, and he knew with a steel certainty that they were ancient. The imperial idea to put permanent military installations near them made a lot of sense, actually. The man was certainly glad for the opportunity to be on the cutting edge of study, it was just that as he was wined and dined in a plush chair, that he could see how daunting the task at hand would be. Before he could take another sip, he pulled a small piece of paper and a portable quill from his uniform robes and left the note for his hungover future to find: ""Make sure to negotiate for a staff of at least t̶w̶o̶ four."" Still, he had the company of beautiful women, and more varieties of cheeses and dates than he had known possible. “The spoils of war,” he thought, as fog rolled in.",2,1768609704.0,DotA2,0,1.0,False

I played it on my iPod touch when I was probably around 11–12, so 2012–2013. The premise of the game was around preparing for prom/homecoming/some high school dance, and you had to earn money doing jobs and stuff to pay for the dress and accessories. I believe it had a time limit, like 14 in-game days or something like that for you to gain experience and money to go to the dance.

My memories around it are fairly fuzzy, but I believe there were multiple choices of jobs, maybe 2 or 3 max, but if not I know for certain one of them was coffee shop/barista based. You were able to pick from a few guys to go to the event with, and I think some of them were locked without sufficient personality points or something similar.

Unfortunately I don't remember much else. I want to say the title was fairly obvious, so keywords like ""prom,"" ""homecoming,"" and ""high school"" are likely to be in the title. I know the girl you played as (or at least the cover for the app) was a brunette with long, wavy hair. I don't remember if there was customization for your character or not, but I can't recall memories of playing as a girl with a different hair color.

If anyone has any idea what I'm on about, it would be great! I mostly want to revisit it for nostalgia (and if it's still available somewhere play it again) so I thank anyone who can help!",1,1768609704.0,tipofmyjoystick,4,1.0,False

These are in no particular order



* Taste of Denmark - great to stop in for a cup of coffee and a bite of the best pastries in Lakewood
* Magill’s World of Ice Cream - Wish I weren’t always on a diet.  My favorite cone in Denver. I’ve had a few memorable birthday cakes from here as well.
* Star Thai - Authentic delicious Thai Food. If you order spicy, be prepared.
* Garramone’s Pizza and Italian Restaurant - The Italian Sausage Sandwich is amazing.  I am pretty sure they source their sausage from Gourmet Meat and Sausage shop next door (great butcher btw if you ever need meats).  Their pizza uses fresh mozzarella and again the sausage is a tier above other places.  It's a little on the crusty side for my taste,  but worth a try when looking for a better quality pie.
* Coyote Table Artisan Kitchen - Speaking of Pizza.  Love this place for their wood fired pizza options. The light crunchy crust, with a nice salad and glass of wine make this one of my favorite spots to eat out.
* Granny Scott’s Pie Shop - for when you need or want an actual pie this is the place to go. They also make some great sandwiches.
* Pho Hau - Go-to spot for Vietnamese food in Lakewood.  Broth is always authentic bone broth and they provide generous portions of fresh toppings. I recommend the crispy shrimp and pork paste appetizer for people wanting to try something new and different.
* Las Fuentes - Great spot for  Mexican favorites. I like to go here and cool off with a nice Horchata.
* He Xing Garden - takeout Chinese food.  They’ve got all my favorites.  I appreciate that they use generous portions of fresh vegetables.
* African Grill and Bar - absolutely delicious. A menu full of many items I’ve not had a chance to experience before. I haven't found any that I don’t enjoy.
* Curry Kitchen - I think I’ve worked my way through almost all of their menu at this point.  I love it all but default to the Tiki Masala when I don’t feel like having to make a decision.
* 240 Union - Usually find myself here if I am craving fish as their chefs always seem to come up with great seafood offerings.  Perfect place for an anniversary or special occasion.
* Westrail Tap and Grill -  They’ve got my favorite Nachos in town (pulled pork is the way to go) and their wings are pretty close to the top of my list.  Nice burgers and a good beer selection as well.  Good place to watch a game.
* Sunrise/Sunset - Breakfast diner food.  Plenty of spicy options which I like to have with my eggs and potatoes.
* Cafe Jordano - Great people and great Italian food.  
* Burrito’s Express - Breakfast burrito is next level and available all day. 
* Yanni’s Gyro’s Place - Sure they’ve got great Gyros,  but I like to slather anything on the menu in their Tzatziki  sauce.
* Davie’s Chuck Wagon Diner - a Colfax original.  Great breakfast options that you would expect from a joint like this.
* Piggin’ Out Smokehouse - They have some great take-out options for feeding a party.  Good briscuit, pork and BBQ sides.",33,1768609577.0,LakewoodColorado,8,0.95,False

1qexhn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qexhn2/i_was_about_to_text_her_then_i_opened_reddit/,I Was About to Text Her. Then I Opened Reddit Instead.,"I know you have all seen some version of this post a hundred times, and I have read way too many of them myself. I was all set to text her because it felt like the natural thing to do, then I decided Reddit would be a good place to look for advice, and now here I am typing this instead. Humor me.

About two months ago, a girl (29) started coming to the gym at the same time as me (M 37). At first she was just a girl at the gym, but over time we started making small talk most days and actually getting to know each other a bit. Nothing super deep, but enough that a crush eventually developed. It is a pretty quiet gym at that hour, so it was easy for that to happen.

I got her number fairly early on, but it was not in a dating context. It was more of a professional favor type situation. I have texted her once since then in a casual way, joking about something that happened at the gym, and that has basically been the status quo.

Today I was planning to grab coffee after my workout, and she finished up around the same time like usual. I asked if she wanted to join. I was a little nervous, so it probably was not as smooth as I would have liked. She paused making what I'd describe as a thinking face for a second, then said she had to study for a test she has at noon. That part is legit, since we have talked about the test before and it is for a work certification. I wished her luck, she thanked me for the offer, we said have a good weekend, and that was it.

There was no counter offer, which I know a lot of people will say means it is dead. I am honestly fine with that. I do genuinely like her personality, so obviously I was hoping this would go in a romantic direction, but I would also be fine with anything on the friendship spectrum. Either way, I will still see her at the gym a few times a week and do not want things to be weird.

Where I am unsure is what, if anything, to do next. My gut tells me to send a quick text later to see how the test went. Part of that is just because I genuinely care how she did, not as a move. It also feels like the thoughtful thing to do and like it would close the loop on things. At the same time, I cannot tell if that comes off as needy or like I am ignoring the fact that she declined. 

I have been out of the dating world for a bit and am mostly just trying to knock the rust off. Curious what others think.",2,1768609438.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

1qexghx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qexghx/aitah_for_leaving_my_ex_stood_up_after_saying_i/,AITAH for leaving my ex stood up after saying I wanted to be friends?,"TL;DR: broke up with my gf and now she’s messaging my friends because I don’t want to communicate.

I (22M) broke up with my girlfriend (19F) of 2.5 months in November, I was going to just let things go quiet and ghost her gradually instead of sending a breakup message to save her the hurt of reading it but I ended up sending a message in the end. She noticed what I was doing and sent me a message saying she was in tears because of me not messaging her so I said that I would do better and that I really liked her when I reality, I wanted to end things then.

2 days later she messaged me again, saying that there had been no improvement and that she didn’t understand why I was going quiet all of a sudden and that she was incredibly confused and hurt. I replied by saying I couldn’t continue the relationship and that I realised that the week before and she got very angry that I hadn’t told her then. I insisted that we stay friends and that I didn’t want to lose contact with her because I just wasn’t in the right headspace for a relationship. I took her out for breakfast 2 weeks later to let her calm down first and a week after that, she asked if I wanted to go for coffee. I said that I would love to but when the day came, I never turned up or messaged her to cancel and I’m not even sure why.

She ended up messaging my friends but I didn’t tell any of my friends about her or the fact that I was dating anyone so they were very confused but she definitely overstepped by messaging them. She asked them if I was okay and said that she was just really worried about me because I gave the excuse of my mental health for the break up. I’m really not happy with the fact that she messaged my friends.

I was her first ever boyfriend so I get that she’s hurt but I don’t have the skills to communicate with her and I just want to leave it be now but she keeps freaking out and messaging people I know.",3,1768609374.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False
1qexg9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1qexg9k/35m_seeking_vibrant_sparks_and_soothing/,[35/M] – Seeking vibrant sparks and soothing connections,"Hello! My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on introspection, curiosity, and passionate drives.

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I’ve seen operators rise and fall like a bad hand of blackjack, watched trends come and go quicker than a high-roller's bankroll, and frankly, I'm tired of the marketing fluff.

That's why I'm here, back on my favourite corner of the internet, sharing the unfiltered truth with you fine folks. You see, 2026 isn't just another year. It’s a seismic shift, especially for us here in Manitoba. The provincial landscape is evolving, payment methods are getting wilder, and the tech? Oh boy, the tech is finally catching up to our expectations. We're talking AI-driven responsible gambling tools that are genuinely smart, not just buzzwords. We're talking crypto payments that are actually fast and secure. It’s a brave new world, and if you’re still playing on some rusty old platform, you’re leaving money on the table, plain and simple.

# Why This Matters: The 2026 Manitoba Landscape - Don't Get Screwed!

Alright, let's talk brass tacks about what's actually going on here in Manitoba in 2026. Forget what you knew five years ago; the game has changed.

Legal & Regulatory Jargon:

While we don't have the explicit, provincially regulated framework like our neighbours in iGaming Ontario, Manitoba operates in a bit of a grey area that largely favours the player, provided you're smart about where you play. Offshore casinos licensed by reputable bodies (think Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission, Curacao eGaming, but with a good reputation to back it up) are generally accessible. The key here is reputable. There are still fly-by-night operations out there, and I’ve seen more players get burned by dodgy licenses than by a poorly dealt hand. Always, always check for proper licensing. If it’s not prominently displayed and verifiable, run faster than a Winnipegger from a mosquito swarm in July.

Payment Landscape: Crypto, Interac, and the Death of Pending Periods:

This is where 2026 really shines. Gone are the days of waiting days, sometimes weeks, for your winnings. If an online casino isn't offering instant withdrawals or at least same-day payouts, they're not even trying.

* **Crypto Payments:** This is the big one. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin – they’re not just for tech bros anymore. For speed and anonymity, crypto is king. Many of the top-tier casinos are now offering near-instant withdrawals via various cryptocurrencies, bypassing traditional banking delays. This isn't just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how money moves in the iGaming world.
* **Interac:** For us Canucks, Interac is still a staple. The best casinos have optimized their Interac e-Transfer processes to be almost as fast as e-wallets. If a casino offers Interac but takes more than a few hours to process, they’re behind the curve.
* **E-wallets (Neteller, Skrill, ecoPayz):** Still solid, still fast. Expect payouts within hours.
* **Bank Transfers/Credit Cards:** These are the slowest. If you’re using these, expect 1-3 business days. While some casinos have improved, the banking system itself is the bottleneck here.

KYC Verification Speed:

""Know Your Customer"" (KYC) is crucial for preventing fraud and money laundering. It’s also often the biggest pain point for players. The best casinos have streamlined this. They use AI-driven verification tools that can scan your ID and verify your address in minutes, not days. If a casino is still asking you for utility bills from three months ago and taking a week to review them, they haven't invested in their tech, and that's a huge red flag. You want casinos that prioritize ""KYC verification speed"" because it directly impacts your ""instant withdrawals.""

The Return to Player (RTP) Myth & Reality:

You’ll hear a lot about ""Return to Player (RTP) percentages."" This is the theoretical percentage of all wagered money a slot or game will pay back to players over time. While individual session results will vary wildly, higher RTPs (generally 96% and above for slots) are always better. However, remember that RTPs are often set by the game provider (NetEnt, Microgaming, Pragmatic Play, Play’n GO, Evolution Gaming for live dealers), not the casino itself. The casino's role is to offer these games transparently. A good casino will make RTP information easily accessible. A great casino will actively promote games with high RTPs.

Wagering Requirements - The Bonus Killer:

This is the one that trips up most casual players. Almost every bonus comes with ""wagering requirements"" – the number of times you have to play through the bonus money (and sometimes your deposit too) before you can withdraw any winnings. A ""no-wagering bonus"" is rare but golden. Typically, anything from 20x to 35x is considered fair. Anything above 40x is often predatory, making it incredibly hard to actually cash out. Always, always read the bonus terms and conditions. I can't stress this enough. That 100% match up to $500 might sound great, but if it has a 50x wagering requirement on both deposit and bonus, you're in for a grind.

This is why understanding these nuances is crucial for any Manitoban looking to get the most out of their online gambling experience in 2026. Don't be a sheep; be an informed wolf.

# Detailed Reviews: Diving Deep into My Top 5 Picks

Alright, let's peel back the layers on these bad boys. Remember, I'm not here to blow smoke; I'm here to give you the real deal.

# 1. [**Winshark**](https://securegame.click/winshark-reddit)

*My personal choice*

I've got buddies who work for a competitor who absolutely *loathe* Winshark. Why? Because Winshark was one of the first to aggressively adopt AI for personalization. We’re not talking about simple ""recommended games"" based on your last spin. I’m talking about ""AI-Personalized Slots"" that subtly adjust volatility and bonus frequency based on your play style and bankroll, within the certified RNG parameters of course. This isn't a cheat; it's smart game management to keep players engaged longer without feeling ripped off. Their internal data analysis team is top-notch, always tweaking user experience, which is why their retention rates are through the roof. They also funnel a significant portion of their profits into securing exclusive early access to games from top-tier providers.

**Performance Data:**

* **RTPs:** Consistently high, with an average site-wide RTP of 96.5%. They openly list individual game RTPs, which I love.
* **Withdrawal Times:** As mentioned, their crypto payouts are blistering fast, often hitting your wallet in under an hour. Interac and e-wallets are typically 1-2 hours.
* **Mobile App Stability:** Their dedicated app is buttery smooth, even on older devices. Minimal crashes, fast loading times, and intuitive navigation. A clear win for mobile-first players.

**The Catch:** While their AI personalization is revolutionary, some players might find it a bit... too smart. It can feel like the casino ""knows"" you a little *too* well, which can be off-putting for those who prefer a more traditional, hands-off experience. Also, their responsible gambling tools, while advanced, can be a bit intrusive if you accidentally trigger an AI flag.

Winshark is setting the standard for the future. If you're open to cutting-edge tech and demand fast payouts, this is your playground. They even snagged an ""EGR Award"" for innovation last year, and it was well deserved.

# 2. [**RollingSlots**](https://securegame.click/rollingslots-reddit)

*Rocking Your Reels Since Day One*

**The ""Insider"" View:** RollingSlots has always had a soft spot in the industry for its genuine dedication to the ""player community."" They don't just say it; they live it. Their customer support team is famously empowered to resolve issues on the first contact, which is rare in this business. I once saw them refund a player a substantial sum for a ""sticky bonus"" issue that most casinos would have just brushed off. Their ""Live Dealer Bet Builder"" feature for 2026 is a game-changer – imagine customising multi-table live bets across different games like roulette and blackjack, all within one intuitive interface. They also have a robust internal fraud detection system that flags suspicious activity without penalizing legitimate players, a common issue elsewhere.

**Performance Data:**

* **RTPs:** Strong, averaging around 96.2%, with a good selection of high RTP slots from NetEnt and Pragmatic Play.
* **Withdrawal Times:** Very reliable for e-wallets and Interac, usually within 2 hours. Crypto is slightly slower than Winshark but still solid at under 4 hours.
* **Mobile App Stability:** Excellent browser-based experience, with a lightweight app planned for late 2026. Currently, their mobile site is fully responsive and very stable.

**The Catch:** Their bonus wagering requirements can sometimes be a little on the higher side (e.g., 40x), especially for their initial welcome offers. While achievable, it means you really need to plan your play. They're also not as cutting-edge on the AI front as Winshark, sticking to more traditional online casino offerings.

If you value excellent customer service, a strong community feel, and a top-tier live casino experience, RollingSlots is a fantastic choice. They've built their reputation on trust and transparency.

# 3. [**Slotavader**](https://securegame.click/slotsvader-reddit)

*Invading Your Screens with Innovative Slots*

**The ""Insider"" View:** Slotavader is the dark horse of this list, but don’t sleep on them. Their name might sound a bit cheesy, but their tech isn't. They've invested heavily in next-gen gaming experiences, particularly ""VR Slot Experiences."" While still niche, they're paving the way. What most people don't know is they have an unparalleled relationship with smaller, independent game studios, often getting exclusive beta tests and early releases that you won't find anywhere else. Their backend infrastructure is ridiculously robust, designed for high traffic and instant processing. They’re also pushing the envelope with true ""gamified loyalty programs"" that offer tangible, real-world rewards, not just bonus spins.

**Performance Data:**

* **RTPs:** Very competitive, often featuring exclusive games with RTPs pushing 97%.
* **Withdrawal Times:** Their ""instant withdrawals"" claim is almost always true for Interac, often under 30 minutes for verified accounts. Crypto is also very fast. This is their strongest suit.
* **Mobile App Stability:** Superb. Their app is lightweight, graphically impressive without being bloated, and incredibly stable. Designed for those who want a quick, seamless gaming session on the go.

**The Catch:** Their overall game library, while high-quality and unique, isn't as vast as some of the larger operators. If you're looking for every single obscure slot under the sun, you might find their selection slightly limited (though always growing). Their marketing is also a bit niche, focusing on the tech-savvy player.

For those who crave the newest, most innovative slots and demand lightning-fast payouts, Slotavader is a hidden gem. Their commitment to rapid transactions and unique game content is commendable.

# 4. [**TonyBet**](https://securegame.click/tonybet-reddit)

*The OG for Sports & Casino Combo*

**The ""Insider"" View:** TonyBet has been around the block, and they've learned a lot. While often known for their sportsbook, their casino offering has matured significantly. What truly sets them apart, especially in 2026, is their ""Enhanced Sportsbook Odds"" that are often unbeatable, particularly for major North American leagues. Behind the scenes, they have a massive team of odds compilers and risk managers working around the clock. Their ""insider"" secret is their incredibly efficient payment processing department that, despite the slightly longer advertised payout times, actually gets things done methodically and without fuss. They’ve also integrated some smart ""AI-driven responsible gambling tools"" that are more proactive than reactive, learning player patterns to intervene before problems escalate.

**Performance Data:**

* **RTPs:** Good, typically 95.8% to 96.0% for slots, with a strong emphasis on fair play and audited RNGs.
* **Withdrawal Times:** This is where they're slightly behind the others. Expect up to 24 hours for most methods, but they are consistently reliable within that timeframe. Bank transfers can still take 1-3 business days.
* **Mobile App Stability:** Their combined sports and casino app is robust and well-designed, if a bit busy. Very stable, rarely crashes, but the load times can be a hair slower than the pure casino apps.

**The Catch:** Their casino bonuses often have stricter wagering requirements and can be less generous than dedicated casino platforms. And as mentioned, the payout speed, while reliable, isn't ""instant."" If you're purely a slot player seeking lightning withdrawals, they might not be your absolute top choice.

TonyBet is the perfect hybrid for players who enjoy both sports betting and casino games. Their experience and reliability make them a solid, trustworthy choice, especially for the discerning sports bettor who occasionally hits the slots.

# 5. [**WildTokyo**](https://securegame.click/wildtokyo-reddit)

*Bringing the Neon Lights of Tokyo to Your Home*

WildTokyo came out swinging a few years ago with a fantastic aesthetic, but they've backed it up with substance. Their secret sauce is their commitment to ""Gamified Loyalty Programs."" This isn't just about earning points; it’s about mini-quests, level-ups, and unlocking unique bonuses and experiences that genuinely feel rewarding. They also have an exceptionally dedicated ""player feedback loop"" – they actually listen to their community and implement changes based on suggestions, something rare in this industry. Their network infrastructure is surprisingly robust, capable of handling thousands of concurrent users without a hiccup, thanks to strategic investment in cloud computing.

**Performance Data:**

* **RTPs:** Solid, with an average around 96.1%. They carry a wide range of providers, including many smaller studios known for their high RTPs.
* **Withdrawal Times:** Very respectable, usually within 4 hours for Interac and crypto. E-wallets are often quicker. Their KYC process is swift, enabling faster initial payouts.
* **Mobile App Stability:** Excellent browser experience. Their focus is on a highly optimized mobile website that feels like an app, rather than a standalone download. Very stable and responsive.

**The Catch:** The vibrant, neon-heavy aesthetic might not appeal to everyone. While I personally love it, some might find it a bit too busy. Also, their customer support, while good, isn’t quite at the ""RollingSlots"" level of first-contact resolution, often requiring a follow-up for complex issues.

WildTokyo is for the player who wants an engaging, visually appealing experience with a strong loyalty program. If you enjoy feeling like you're progressing and earning tangible rewards beyond just winning cash, WildTokyo delivers.

# Step-by-Step Guide: How to Sign Up & Verify for Instant Payouts in 2026

This is crucial, folks. Don't mess this up. A smooth verification process is your ticket to ""how to bypass pending withdrawal periods"" and unlock those ""instant withdrawals.""

1. **Choose Your Champion:** Pick one of the casinos from my list (or do your own deep dive). Click on the \[affiliate link placeholder\] (just kidding, but seriously, find their site) and look for the ""Sign Up"" or ""Register"" button.
2. **Basic Info First:** You'll enter standard details: Name, Email, Date of Birth, Address, Phone Number. Make sure everything is 100% accurate and matches your official ID. This isn't the time to be creative with your name or address.
3. **Create Strong Credentials:** Pick a unique username and a strong password. Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) if offered – it's a must for security in 2026.
4. **Deposit (If Ready):** If you're going for a welcome bonus, ensure your first deposit meets the minimum criteria. Choose your preferred payment method (Interac, Crypto, E-wallet for speed!).
5. **THE VERIFICATION STAGE (KYC - Don't Skip This!):**
   * **Identity Proof:** Most casinos in 2026 use automated ID verification. You'll typically be asked to upload a scan or clear photo of a government-issued ID (Driver's License, Passport). Hold it up to your webcam or phone camera as instructed. The best ones will use AI to verify it in minutes.
   * **Address Proof:** A recent utility bill (electricity, internet, gas) or bank statement, usually dated within the last 3 months. Make sure your name and address are clearly visible and match your registration details.
   * **Payment Method Proof:** If you used a credit card, you might need to show a picture of it (obscuring the middle digits). For e-wallets, a screenshot of your account page showing your name and email. For crypto, no real proof needed beyond the wallet address itself.
6. **Confirmation & Play:** Once verified (and for the top casinos, this should be within an hour, maybe a few depending on volume), you'll get a confirmation. Then, you're free to play and, more importantly, withdraw your winnings without unnecessary delays!

*Pro-Tip: Complete KYC* ***before*** *you even make your first deposit, if possible. That way, when you hit that big win, you're ready to cash out immediately.*

# Responsible Gambling in 2026: Bankroll Management for Grown-Ups

Alright, this isn’t the sexy part, but it’s the most important. As an old hand in this business, I’ve seen lives ruined. Gambling should be entertainment, not a source of stress or financial ruin. In 2026, with ""AI-driven responsible gambling tools"" becoming standard, there’s no excuse not to play it smart. The ""Responsible Gambling Council"" and ""Gambling Therapy"" are out there for a reason.

1. **Set a Budget (and Stick to It):** This is the golden rule. Decide how much you can afford to lose *before* you start playing. This isn't money you expect to get back; it's entertainment money. Once it's gone, it's gone. No chasing losses. I'm talking a hard limit, folks. Write it down, tell your partner, whatever it takes.
2. **Use Casino Tools:** Every reputable casino on my list will have deposit limits, loss limits, session limits, and self-exclusion options. Use them! Seriously, set your weekly or monthly deposit limit. Don't be too proud. These are there to help you, not hinder your fun.
3. **Time Management:** It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re in the zone. Set a timer, or better yet, use the casino’s session limit tool. Step away, stretch, grab a coffee. A fresh mind makes better decisions.
4. **Never Chase Losses:** This is the quickest way down a spiral. If you're down, accept it. Tomorrow's another day. The house always has an edge over the long run, remember that ""RNG (Random Number Generator)"" is designed for fairness, but not guaranteed wins.
5. **Don't Gamble Under Influence:** Alcohol or drugs impair judgment. Play when you're clear-headed and focused.
6. **Seek Help If Needed:** If gambling stops being fun and starts feeling like a compulsion, reach out. Resources like the Responsible Gambling Council are there for free, confidential help. Your mental and financial health are paramount.

*Hot Take: The best ""AI-driven responsible gambling tools"" in 2026 can actually detect subtle changes in your play patterns (e.g., increased bet size after a loss, longer session times) and proactively offer breaks or suggest limits. Embrace these tools; they're genuinely designed to help.*

1qexfp5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qexfp5,From the Wagon: Bit Pruitt and Chuckwagon Culture,"By Western Horseman

January 14, 2026

From cooking schools to feeding the Road to the Horse Retreat, Bit Pruitt keeps the coffee hot and the tradition intact.

There are plenty of ways to impress people with food. White tablecloths. Careful plating. 

That has never interested John “Bit” Pruitt. 

Pruitt is the chuckwagon cook behind From the Wagon, a business that brings camp-style Western cooking to events, ranch gatherings and immersive cooking schools. The food draws people in, but Pruitt says the real goal has always been something quieter: slowing people down enough to understand the culture behind it. 

“We’re not trying to dress it up,” Pruitt says. “If somebody comes expecting fancy, they’re probably in the wrong place. What we’re offering is the way it was done and the reason it was done that way.” 

For Pruitt, chuckwagon cooking is function and tradition rolled into one. 

“We try not to boogie up the wagon,” Pruitt says. “We keep it pretty raw. Cast iron, firewood and doing our best to keep it correct.” 

#Finding His Way to the Wagon

Pruitt did not grow up on a ranch, but he says he gravitated early toward Western people and Western work. That pull led him into cowboy jobs and a life where skills are learned through observation and repetition rather than instruction. 

“I was always watching,” Pruitt says. “You learn real quick that if you pay attention, people will teach you without ever saying a word.” 

His introduction to chuckwagon cooking came in the mid-1990s on a ranch in Henrietta, Texas. The landowner, a generational rancher who still owned his grandfather’s wagon, was injured and needed help catering an event. Pruitt had never cooked that way before, but he agreed to step in. 

“I know you like to cook,” Pruitt remembers being told. “He needs some help. He’s cooking off a chuckwagon.” 

That first weekend turned into years of cooking, traveling and catering across Texas and Oklahoma. Pruitt watched a seasoned wagon cook manage every part of the operation. 

“It wasn’t just about the food,” Pruitt says. “It was how he moved, how he stayed organized, how he thought three steps ahead. You realize real quick the cooking is only part of it.” 

Chuckwagon cooking, Pruitt learned, requires precision disguised as simplicity. 

“You don’t get second chances,” he says. “If you mess up your heat or your timing, you feel it. There was nothing easy about it.” 

#A Cooking School Built on History

After years of cooking at events and gatherings, Pruitt and his partner began offering something more immersive: a chance for others to learn the craft firsthand. From the Wagon’s cooking school is designed for people who want the real thing, not a polished version of it. 

Pruitt and his partner host schools in the spring and fall when schedules allow. Though the class itself runs three and a half days, Pruitt says each school requires closer to 10 days of preparation and cleanup. 

“There’s a lot that happens before anyone ever shows up,” Pruitt says. “The wagon doesn’t just roll out and magically work.” 

The format runs Thursday through Sunday. Students learn Dutch oven fundamentals, open-fire cooking, heat management using coals and how to read food without timers or thermometers. Just as important, Pruitt says, is understanding why chuckwagon cooking developed the way it did. 

“We spend a lot of time on the why,” he says. “Why this tool, why this method, why this order. Once people understand that, everything else starts to make sense.” 

Pruitt emphasizes that chuckwagon cooking was built around feeding crews efficiently. 

“It had to work every time,” Pruitt says. “Nobody cared if it looked fancy. They cared if it filled them up and held them through the day.” 

The school ends with a graduation test. On Saturday night, students cook a protein, a side and a dessert, then serve the meal to 25 to 35 guests. 

“When you’re cooking for strangers, the stakes feel different,” Pruitt says. “And when they come back and tell you it was good, that means something.”

#Cooking for Road to the Horse Retreat

This year, Pruitt’s wagon rolled into a setting that made even him pause: the first Road to the Horse Retreat, held September 19–21, 2025, at The Ranch at NRS in Decatur, Texas. 

From the Wagon served as the official food provider for the retreat, feeding clinicians, staff and participants throughout the event. Pruitt says what stood out most was not just the size of the gathering, but the quality of the horsemen involved. 

“We can hear what’s going on while we’re cooking,” Pruitt says. “I remember stopping and thinking, man, I forgot about that. I’m glad I heard him say that.” 

Between meals, Pruitt found himself learning alongside everyone else. 

“That’s the kind of thing you don’t expect,” he says. “You go there to do a job, and you leave better for it.” 

Pruitt describes the experience as humbling, especially being trusted with a role that helped keep the retreat running smoothly. 

“How are we lucky enough to be here cooking for some of the best of the best?” Pruitt says. “People came from all over the world. To be trusted with that part of the event means a lot.” 

#Honoring the Culture

Pruitt speaks like someone trying to honor the culture that welcomed him. 

“I give God complete glory,” Pruitt says. “I’m just grateful He’s allowed us to make a living in a culture we care about, and we take pride in doing our best to keep it correct.” 

That mindset carried through when From the Wagon was named a Top Three Finalist by the Academy of Western Arts. Pruitt accepted the recognition quietly. 

“It’s humbling,” he says. “When people taste food cooked in the open and realize it can still be that good, you can see it on their faces. That’s the reward.” 

If Pruitt has a mission, it remains unchanged. 

Cast iron. Good food. And a wagon that still looks like a wagon.

**Former Sporting Lisbon football player, now 37 years old and playing for Romanian side Cluj, reveals his first season with... quirky habits.**

Islam Slimani opened his book of memories to reveal, perhaps, one of the most hilarious stories from his time at Sporting, which was divided into two periods - he arrived in 2013 and left in 2016, returning in 2021/22. The Algerian striker, currently 37 years old and playing for the Romanian team Cluj, explains that the focus was so much on working and improving, then under the command of Leonardo Jardim, that he neglected his diet...

""I was starving when I arrived at Sporting. My life was like this: I'd go to training, come home and eat a pizza – one of those frozen ones... I swear it's true. Frozen pizza at midday; and I also ate noodles, the kind that come in a packet and you boil them. I ate that every day, plus tuna and margarine... I'd take a nap, have a coffee, and what I hadn't eaten in the morning, I'd eat at night or the next day. I did that for a year. I didn't go to a restaurant once. I swear, and I didn't know how to cook..."", the striker explained in an interview given to journalist Colin Dicanot's channel.

And he finished, amidst... much laughter from both of them: ""You know the worst part? They provided lunch at the Academy, but I didn't know. I was so focused that I didn't even know and went straight home \[after training\]. And nobody asked me why I wasn't going to eat...""

With the Lion on his chest, Slimani completed 123 games (plus one in the B team), in which he scored 61 goals and registered nine assists. In 2013, the SAD paid 300,000 euros to CR Belouizdad, an Algerian club, for his transfer.",57,1768609188.0,soccer,8,0.98,False

1qexc1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Basheer20599/comments/1qexc1p/fitness_app_for_workout_and_nutrition/,Fitness App for Workout and Nutrition tracking/planning,"Hey everyone! 👋

So I've been working out for a few years now, and like many of you, I've tried pretty much every fitness app out there. Some are great for workouts but terrible for nutrition. Others have amazing food tracking but the workout logging feels like an afterthought. And don't even get me started on the ones that charge $15/month for basic features...

Anyway, I decided to scratch my own itch and build something that actually does everything I need in one place. After way too many late nights and probably too much coffee, I finally released it on the Play Store.

It's called **Light Weight** and here's what it does:

**Workout stuff:**

* Log your sets, reps, and weights (obviously)
* Big exercise library with actual instructions so you're not guessing on form
* Pre-built programs if you need structure
* See your progress over time (because PRs matter)

**Food tracking:**

* Calorie and macro tracking
* AI food scanner - literally just point your camera at your food and it logs it (this one took forever to build but it's actually pretty cool)
* Save your meals so you don't have to re-enter your sad desk lunch every day

**Other stuff:**

* Water tracking (we all need that reminder)
* Weight and body measurement logging with charts
* Achievement system to keep things interesting

I know the app store is flooded with fitness apps, but I genuinely tried to make something that's actually useful and not annoying to use.

Would really appreciate it if some of you could try it out and let me know what you think. What's missing? What sucks? What's actually good? I'm actively developing it and want to make it better.

1qex96y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qex96y/if_the_walls_could_talk/,If The Walls Could Talk,"I’m really in no place to wax dramatic. I’m huddled as close to a space heater as possible without catching my eyebrows on fire, wrapped in three blankets. I’ve got a shivering purse dog clutched to my chest and the tears on my face have long since lost their warmth. But bear with me here. It’s the easiest way to put you in my shoes.

Picture your childhood bedroom, somewhere familiar. You’re laying there in the dark, and something is in your closet. The door cracks open just far enough for you to see a pair of enormous red eyes and for a pair of claws to grip the door. Naturally, you’re gonna scream for your parents, and eventually, they’re going to sleepily make it down the hall to you. They banish the monster simply by being there, pulling the closet door open and pointing at the clothes and toys and normal things. “See?” They say. “There’s no such thing as monsters.”

Now, I want you to picture instead that you’re in the closet. You’re not on neutral ground anymore; this is the monster’s domain. The door won’t open, and you can hear the heavy breaths of the beast— feel the drip of its saliva on your face. You can bang on the door, or scream, or do any number of things to escape or call for help, to struggle in the trap, but you’re nothing here. It’s only a matter of when. 

I can’t say I didn’t deserve this. I tried to tell myself that I was a good squatter. That I tried to protect her, and the house when it came down to it. But I was still an intruder, and I guess this is my karma. 

Before anyone makes any assumptions about the kind of person I am, I don’t crawl into people’s walls for sick kicks. But this dusty, creaky space between wooden beams is the only stable shelter I’ve known in years. For the record, I didn’t choose to be this desperate. I’m not on any hard drugs. Alcohol makes me violently ill. And before the things that happened in this house, I was decently sure I was of sound mind. 

My parents would tell you a different story. They’d tell you how they caught their boy Hunter, eldest son and hardest worker on their family farm, kissing another farmhand behind the grain silo. Long story short, I packed a bag at gunpoint, and then we were both forced away, to the tune of my sobbing mother and my angry father. I don’t know where that boy is now, and it doesn't matter much, but I hope he’s doing alright. 

I was only sixteen then, and  I was fucking terrified. I made my way up from the rural wasteland over the course of a few days, ending in Atlanta. I didn’t stay there long— a few months, at most.  All I can say is, I hold no blame for the people who turn to substances to cope with life on the streets. And that I would’ve rather died than stay there, starving and sleeping in the gutter. So, I snuck on a Greyhound, resolving to go wherever it took me. 

I traced a red line from the Southeast to the Midwest, moving on by whatever way was available. I walked, for the most part. Sometimes I hitchhiked, and sometimes I could bribe my way into a bus fare or once, even a train ride. I slept where my body dropped: beside a highway, under a tree, at the edge of a truck stop parking lot, in a cave, and the occasional abandoned shack. I did my best to mind my own business, and not take advantage of anyone who hadn’t offered help in the first place. But you can only be woken up by fire ant bites or fight a coyote for a discarded sandwich so many times. 

So, slowly, I taught myself how to pick locks. I learned how to squeeze all six feet of me through tight spaces and breathe without making a sound. As a rule. I never touched houses. I’d nestle myself deep into a hay bale in some farmer’s barn, or take up two-days’ residence in the end room of a motel. I never meant for this to happen— for people to get hurt. You gotta believe me when I say that. 

Georgia could get pretty nasty in the winter, but the cold of Nebraska was brutal and unexpected. I should’ve been better prepared; I should’ve known what kind of storm I was walking into. But, after two long years on the road, that was the first winter I ever saw snow. It wasn’t so bad that first time— watching it fall in flakes from the booth of a McDonald’s in Omaha. I stared in in awe, steam from the coffee I’d spent my last five bucks on warming my face. The sight of it brought back something I thought I’d lost.

The wonder didn’t stick around long, though. As I headed further toward the panhandle, the weather turned hostile. My jacket and hat were all but frozen onto me, and I’d tied my only spare shirt around my mouth and nose. I had no gloves, or anything to wrap my hands with, and it was becoming a huge problem.

The wind was the worst, whipping over my exposed skin like shards of glass, and out here, there was no shelter from it. In fact, there wasn’t much shelter anywhere. Along the empty fields and highways, I was lucky to find anything to shield me from the wind and snow for a minute, let alone somewhere to stay the night. More and more, I was sleeping on the icy ground and waking up to my teeth chattering.

I don’t remember where exactly I was when my hands stopped working. I think I’d been trying to pick the lock of a power station shed, but I couldn’t flex my fingers. They were red and raw, turning white at the edges. As I looked them over, a black cloud rolled over me, and my soul sank to my feet. I was doomed.

Things get blurry after that. To add insult to injury, a blizzard moved in, leaving me lost in a whiteout. My body began to shut down, and the cold left me too confused to realize it. I just knew something was horribly wrong.

I called out to anyone who would listen, to my mom, to my dad, to my siblings. All that answered back was the howl of the storm. Desperately, I staggered on through the piling snow, and I began to hear a pair of footsteps behind me. They weren’t… right. Disjointed, but fast. Bipedal. I’d seen a fox walk on two legs before, its eyes crossed with madness. This was a little like that, but more intelligent. Purposeful. It was getting faster, and I was getting slower. 

Adrenaline warmed my frozen limbs and I started to run. Branches thrashed into my clothes and skin, shedding their icicles as I fled for my life. I worried I’d somehow wandered into a forest— nowhere I would find help. A shadow fell over me, the deep glow of red eyes, and a scream finally tore out of my chest, lost on the wind. I threw off my jacket and put all the strength I had left into keeping my momentum. 

Then, like the North Star, a light broke the darkness. Shining out into the swirling snow was a flickering porch lamp, half hidden by the side of the large house it belonged to. I had no time to consider my options. I just ran toward it. 

I slammed my useless hands against the front door… once… twice… no answer. In a last ditch effort, I fumbled with the handle, only to discover it was unlocked. The footsteps had devolved into a slow, almost confused rhythm, and I knew this was my only chance. 

I threw open the door and it rattled as I shut it. I cringed and waited for some angry homeowner with a gun to come rushing down the stairs, or a little girl to scream that there was a strange man in her house. Even in my terror, I knew I’d crossed a line. But nothing disturbed the quiet.

I turned and looked out the frosty window set into the now-locked door. No footprints, or sign of any monsters, just ice and snow tossing and turning in the relentless wind. The longer I stood in the warmth, the more the memory fell apart. Had I ever fully seen what was chasing me? Or was it just a trick Old Man Winter was playing?

When I faced into the house again, I was met with another beast entirely. Standing on the patterned rug in the living room and facing me down like the leader of a wolfpack was a tiny dog. She was one or other of those fluffy kinds rich people have, and the growl coming off her told me I was two seconds from having my throat ripped out by her crooked teeth. 

“Come on now, pup,” I tried, “I don’t mean any harm. I just want to warm up, and then I’ll go.”

The furry little thing actually squinted at me. I crouched down and offered out my hand. She stared at it for a good minute before toddling over and giving it a sniff. Her tail started to wag, and I guess I passed whatever test this was. This close, I noticed her collar.

“Tuesday. What a silly name for a dog.”

Recognizing her name, she did a dumb little twirl and fell back on her behind. I decided I liked Tuesday. 

Instinctively, I left my wet and worn boots by the door as I walked into the living room. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d been in an actual house. Apparently, I’d also forgotten today was Christmas. During the time I could keep my phone charged, the days meant less and less to me as they went by with no changes. In the back of my mind somewhere, I knew it was December 25th. But that had become only another day of struggle.

The glow of a dying fire and a blinking Christmas tree cast shadows on the floral wallpaper. Tuesday stood sentinel by it, just in case she had been wrong about me and I tried to rob her owner. I sat down by the fire and, after some internal debate, added a log. The flames flared, glittering off the wrapped boxes laid under the tree. The small amount told me there probably weren’t any kids in the house. Not only that, but most of them were addressed to one person: May. 

I huddled by the fire and said a silent apology to her as the cold in my body melted away. Pain replaced it; my fingers began to crack and bleed, along with my chapped lips. When I finally stopped shivering, I sifted through my bag and found my first aid stash gone. Instead of leaving blood all over this stranger’s house, I hurried into the kitchen to rinse my hands. My weight shifted the hardwood boards beneath me, and as I drank from the faucet, I wondered why my being here hadn’t drawn any more attention than the dog’s. 

The cozy, grandmotherly loneliness of the house gave me the horrible idea that I would go upstairs and find the fresh body of some sweet old lady. In search of answers and something to wrap my stinging hands in, I climbed the stairs, Tuesday following behind. 

The upper floor was small, and filled with photographs. Generations were played out on the walls, and it reminded me just how little I belonged in this picture. There were two doors in the loft, and one was left ajar. Holding my breath, I glanced in through the crack, and almost let it out in relief. I hadn’t stumbled upon a body, but a middle-aged blonde woman sleeping soundly in her bed. Tuesday squirmed between my legs and into the bedroom, laying down at the foot of it. The blankets were pulled to her chin, and she’d fallen asleep with a pair of round-rimmed glasses sitting crooked on her nose. I assumed this was May, and I moved on. Must be a heavy sleeper, I thought to myself. 

I tried the other door, which thankfully turned out to be a bathroom. After a search of the medicine cabinet, I cleaned up my hands and lips, and looked at myself in the mirror. I couldn’t stand it for very long; I didn’t recognize the thin, weathered face that stared back at me. 

Now that my shuffling footsteps had stopped, the faint noises of the house took their place. A heater hummed somewhere in the walls. Water ran idly through the pipes above and below me. The bones of the house settled against the storm outside. Drifting in from the bedroom, where a clock radio sat on May’s nightstand, was the chorus of California Dreamin’. My chest ached at the thought of being somewhere safe and warm.

I slipped out of the bathroom, and went back down the stairs. The living room was just the same as I’d left it.

I should’ve taken a coat, maybe a little bit of food, and gone. But the fear of whatever had driven me here wouldn’t fully leave, overshadowed by the despair of returning to the cold I’d crawled out of. Worse than both, was the years of exhaustion hitting me all at once. Every step was beginning to feel like pushing a boulder. 

Instead, I lingered by the last of the fire, telling myself “just a little bit longer…” My eyelids grew heavy, my mind wandered, and just as I was about to sit down on the green, plush couch, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. As I looked around, wide awake now, I realized that weak morning sunlight was spilling through the windows. In a split second decision that I will regret for the rest of my life, instead of running out the door, I snatched my boots and dove into the closet at the back of the room. 

“Merry Christmas, Tuesday!”

My unwitting roommate emerged into the living room, carrying her dog and sitting down by the Christmas tree. I knew she would probably spend most of that day here. I was trapped. 

The closet was dark and full of thick blankets and quilts. As I buried myself beneath them, I knew deep down that I didn’t stand a chance at keeping myself awake long enough to find an opportunity to leave. I’d barely strung together another mental apology before falling into a deep, dreamless sleep. 

I woke up with a start, like someone had shaken me awake— a phantom of all the nights spent on benches. The smell of Christmas dinner filled my nose, and I prayed that my stomach stayed quiet. I tried to focus on the muffled voices beyond, and it wasn’t a moment too soon.

“I’m going to make up the couch for you guys while dinner finishes, I think I’ve got some spare blankets and sheets in the coat closet.”

I tried to tell myself that she could’ve been talking about any closet. But when I looked up and saw the woolen coats just barely brushing the top of my head, I began to panic. Red and blue lights and handcuffs flashed through my mind, and suddenly I was moving. 

I wedged myself between the wall and the miscellaneous boxes stuffed into the corner. At first, I hoped to just narrowly avoid being seen, like a demon antagonist, folded unnaturally into the corner. But as I froze, the smell of cooking food overwhelmed me again. I could almost see the spread of cooked meats and vegetables, of bread and butter and Christmas cookies, like I was looking through a lit match. It reminded me of home, of the good times. 

As footsteps approached and the door swung open, my hunger betrayed me, and I squeezed my eyes shut as the sound of my stomach growling echoed out into the living room.

“What was that?” May said, with confusion and mild alarm. I held my breath and pressed myself against the ceiling, and that’s when I felt something uneven in the plaster above me. May began to sift through the blankets below. She must’ve not heard exactly where the sound came from, and it gave me just enough time to notice the panel in the top of the closet.

I slid it open, all my stealth put to the ultimate test. I wanted to scramble through, to throw myself into whatever hidden crevice would get me out of this mess, but instead, I forced myself to move slower than I ever had. Once there was a wide enough gap, I raised myself, boots and all, into the crawlspace above. She didn’t even look up.

“I must be losing it,” I heard her say finally, and she gathered up a few blankets and shut the closet door. I’d escaped, and even though I’d narrowly avoided being caught, I still didn’t feel much better. 

Letting out the breath I’d been desperately holding, I pulled out my dying phone and lit the flashlight. I had to slouch against the slope of the ceiling, and I stifled a cough from the dust. The pseudo-room had some electrical panels, and the HVAC; not really a place anyone had any reason to check that often. It was cold, but sheltered from the wind and snow outside still, and I’d made it up with a quilt still wrapped around my shoulders. Three walls met, not much bigger than a coffin, but there was a gap at the fourth, just short enough to barely reach and wide enough to squeeze through if I tried hard enough.

Digging my nails into old wood, I slid through the crack and spilled out into a much larger room. Piles of boxes and forgotten furniture, along with another hatch in the floor, told me this was an attic. Out of the way, far enough removed from the house, and with plenty of places to hide if the need arose; I already knew I was going to be here for a while.

I didn’t want to leave those first few days. I lived off half a water bottle shoved into my pocket and long-expired sewing tin cookies. Almost a week had gone by before I’d run out of alternatives. I had to leave and go back into the house. Unconsciously, I noticed the pattern of when the car outside would leave, and when it would come back. I knew when May would go, and about how much time I had. I just had to work up the nerve.

That first time I dropped down from the closet was terrifying. I half-expected the door to crash open, and for someone to point and scream “AHA!” But the house was silent, save for the sound I soon discovered to be Tuesday gnawing a bone twice her size. I slipped by her and went straight for the kitchen, raiding a small amount of food and water before hightailing it back to the attic. 

That became my routine for a few weeks. As I got used to the new environment, and a slightly more stable place to stay, I started exploring the thin spaces between the inner walls. It was an old house; that much was clear. I could move through most of the inside without leaving it. It was lonely, though, with nothing but dust, fiberglass, and the odd mouse corpse or two. 

Eventually, it all got to me— the dust and dirt, the darkness, and constantly having a wall at my front and at my back, save for the time I risked sleeping in the attic.

I left the closet much earlier one morning, just after May had gone to work. I just meant to walk around a little longer than usual and stretch my legs, but when I made it upstairs, I found myself glancing into the ajar bathroom. It smelled so nice, and steam still clung to the edges of the mirror. I was moving before I had any time to consider it. 

I’d closed my eyes for a moment, after watching the shower water turn dark beneath me for a while, and that’s when I heard it. The skin-crawling sound of nails against glass. There was a small window set into the wall just above the shower, and when I opened my eyes, faint lines ran along the length of the glass, so shallow they almost didn’t look real. 

And maybe they weren’t. But the fear creeping up my spine, turning the scalding water to ice and my legs to stone, was. Something was watching me, and the animal sense deep down in me, the one I’d had to nurture to survive this far, knew it. 

I should’ve run right then, but I couldn’t. I didn’t. Instead, as the feeling slowly passed, and I could breathe again, I finished cleaning up and retreated from the bathroom on eggshells.

In the heart of the house, I felt a little safer. When I passed the laundry room, I took the opportunity to wash my clothes. Tuesday planted herself in the doorway and waited with me, studying me with innocent curiosity. The fluffy face of my companion sapped the unease right out of me, making everything feel just a little bit better. Dogs usually do.

Once the washer and dryer had both cycled, and I’d taken a small amount of food from the kitchen, I stood in the living room for a little while, trying to will myself to make the climb back into cramped darkness. 

Tuesday stood beside me, looking up like an expectant child. I reached down and gave her a scratch behind the ears. 

**BANG**. 

The sound startled me into standing. As I was trying to figure out what it was and where it came from, it repeated. Hard, against the front door. There was a figure there, hard to make out through frosted glass. Tuesday began to growl.

It came again, a fist against the door, and I took a step back. That was all the go-ahead it needed; a flurry of forceful pounding made the door rattle in its frame. I dove for the closet and desperately pulled myself back up to safety, hoping I hadn’t left that poor little dog to die. I waited anxiously until May's car returned in the early evening. I heard her comforting her spooked dog through the vents, and breathed a sigh of relief. 

Those vents became a lifeline for me after that. The snippets of conversation and general sounds of life were my only source of information and my sole entertainment. She mostly talked to Tuesday, though she’d get the occasional phone call or visitor. I learned a lot about her in the weeks and months to come. 

“I think I’m going to bake heart-shaped brownies for the class this year. What do you think, Tues?” She was a school teacher. Elementary, to be specific.

“And when I bring Bigfoot to your doorstep someday, I’ll be the one laughing at you!” She believed in most things: aliens, monsters, demons, ghosts. She held a special place in her heart for Bigfoot. Also for her sister. 

“You really should come visit over spring. The house gets really quiet without you here.” She lived here alone, for the most part. This house went back to her great grandfolk, and even though it was states away from the rest of her family, she made a point to move in when she inherited it. 

After long enough for the anxiety to wear off, I pulled my ear away from the walls and away from the vents and began to venture back out of the crawlspace. I learned the layout of the house inside as well as I knew the spaces between. I could stay out for days at a time, wedging myself into cracks, slipping into closets, and standing silent in the shadows.

I know what words come to mind. Monster. Creeper. Parasite. Trust me, I thought them about myself plenty. But even as the weather warmed, the idea of going back to sleeping under bushes was unbearable. 

So, I did all I could to be a manageable uninvited houseguest. I took and used the bare minimum of what I needed to survive. I did my best to respect her privacy. I even did her dishes a couple times. 

But as time went on, she began to notice. I almost wish she had been openly suspicious, instead of the alternative.

“I think she’s with me,” I heard her say to her visiting sister, “I feel a presence here, especially at night. Footsteps wake me up at odd hours. Sometimes I think I hear whispers. Even Tuesday has noticed it, but she doesn’t seem scared.”

“And you really think it’s Mom?”

She paused. My stomach clenched.

“I do. I think she’s proud of me for being here. For sticking it out, even when it’s been rough. God, I’d give anything to see her again.”

With that, I retreated into the attic, wishing I could crawl out of my own skin. Wishing even more that somehow, impossibly, I could be the spirit she was looking for. A loving mother, sitting at the table with a cup of tea for the lonely woman who couldn’t sleep. Instead, I was just a stowaway. 

Motivated by guilt rather than fear this time, I stayed in the attic for weeks, burning through the small stockpile of supplies I had. Warm weather turned hotter, and the air grew stuffy and doubly harder to breathe in. Summer snuck up on the both of us.

I distinctly remember it was the Fourth of July when things took a turn for the worse. I could hear the nonstop fireworks all around, and that was the night I decided I would leave. With her few months off, May didn’t leave the house much, but she had a doctor’s appointment the next day. I’d be gone by the afternoon, and she’d never have to know the truth. 

I’d almost fallen asleep, tossing and turning in the persistent heat. Then, all of a sudden, a rush of cool air soothed my sweaty skin. I almost surrendered to it and let the new comfort pull me into sleep. I don’t think I’d be writing this if I had. But, despite the exhaustion, I fought it away. Something wasn’t right. That’s when the sniffing started. That’s when I heard the gnawing.

Moonlight spilled in as shingles crumbled and wood was pulled away. Confused at first, I walked toward the source of the noise, and narrowly avoided losing my leg to whatever was clawing into the hole. Stumbling back, I watched the small view outside fill with dark fur, and a single, glowing eye. The sniffing turned to scratching. The gnawing grew savage. In the time it took me to reach the middle of the room, the hole opened wide enough for the thing to poke its head through. Teeth the size of railroad ties clicked together in my direction as those red eyes rolled around in their sockets. Its ears laid flat back against the side of its long face, and a low growl replaced the squeak I’d grown accustomed to hearing every once in a while living here. 

I watched, paralyzed, as the rat’s head gave way to the shoulders and arms of a man as it wriggled its way into the attic. Massive as it was, it moved almost silently. Sharp nails curled on the ends of dirty human feet, half of a chewed-on tail hanging behind them. It closed the distance between us as I backed against the far wall.

Gaunt and doubled over on itself, it came eye-to-eye with me. When our gazes met, I could hear it. The growls suddenly had horrible meaning; they made words. This… creature. It lusted for blood, for fear, for pain. It hated. It wouldn’t stop until the entire world was razed, piece by insignificant piece. And somehow, by some insane coincidence, this house was the lucky starting point. 

“Go away,” I said shakily, into the face of death, “leave this house!”

I shut my eyes, unable to stand it, and swung first, for all the good it would do. Instead, I hit empty air. I risked opening my eyes, and found nothing. All it left in its wake was a rotten smell, and the ratty remains of the jacket I’d lost on the way here. The dots started to connect. 

I stood there for a while, trying desperately to make sense of everything that just happened. When the light of day started to creep in through the hole, my legs finally unlocked. I took a few loose boards from the crawlspace and waited until May left to nail them over the hole, shoving furniture against it for good measure. 

It never left. During the nights, it paced the outside, just loud enough for me to hear. The stench was overwhelming, seeping through the cracks in the attic roof. It tapped the walls as it went, and I followed it. I couldn’t understand why it hadn’t come to kill us yet, but I would play its game, if it had any hope of being a warning.  

Tap. “You won’t get away with this.” Tap tap. “I won’t let you, you rotten fuck.” Tap tap tap.

I was losing it a little, more than I already had. I followed the yellow wallpaper, crawling along the attic floor whenever the tapping began and insulting the horrible thing I could almost see on the other side. 

All this to say, I wasn’t paying attention when I nudged a box or two, but the shattering of a glass Jack o’Lantern snapped me out of it. I’d made a thousand tiny sounds up here, but this one was too loud to be ignored. Confused, unsure footsteps made their way through the house and to the attic hatch. 

“Hello?” She called, and I bit my lip, choking back the urge to just give myself away. But I couldn’t. If I got forced out now, she would be defenseless, having no idea what lurked just beyond her walls until it was too late. Instead, I moved quietly around the small space, dodging her until she found the decoration and decided out loud it had just been an animal. Or maybe her motherly spirit playing a nasty joke.

I didn’t like it, but it gave me an idea. She wasn’t safe here, and there was no chance or time for me to warn her properly. I could still get her to leave before it was too late, but it wouldn’t be pretty. 

I bided my time as the nights grew colder and longer. When I started, it was small things. Knocking on interior walls. Opening cabinets and drawers, leaving things in too much of a mess to be ignored. It was subtle at first, but May began to get nervous. I left her notes in odd places, an inarguable “GET OUT” she would always find. Every night, before the snow grew too heavy, I saw the shining red of the rat’s eye. The huff of its hungry breath. The scratching and tapping that never seemed to stop once the sun went down. 

I thanked god that May wasn’t a night owl. And then I made things worse. The ‘spirit’ in her house got serious.

I ran laps around the attic, up and down the stairs, racing through the house and ducking silently into a closet or a shadow whenever she gave chase to the split-second silhouette her sleepy eyes had seen. I stood on the hatch ladder and screamed with real despair, dashing out of sight when she rushed to investigate. I left long scratches on her doors and smeared handprints on her windows, something evil trying desperately to get out. 

She called the police the first time when the fire in the fireplace started on its own. They cared at first, sure. But when several full sweeps of the house found nothing, they began to distance themselves from the whole thing. They branded her as crazy, and it was quickly looking that way. By the week of Thanksgiving, one she’d have to spend alone in her prison of a house, she didn’t sleep in her bedroom anymore. Her eyes were sunken and her hair was a mess. But she was still clinging on.

Silently, I begged her to give up. To just pick up Tuesday, throw a bag in her car, and never come back to this place. If I was the only thing left to eat, I could be okay with that. I deserved it. Her grip on sanity was slipping, and the guilt I felt was so heavy I could barely process it. 

I watched her eat Thanksgiving dinner alone, letting the house go unhaunted for the day. It was almost peaceful. She had to think it was over. I only left long enough to grab a picture frame from her bedroom, somewhere I hadn’t dared to step foot in before. 

As midnight broke, I lowered myself down from the crawlspace I’d slipped into almost a year before. As I walked around the couch, I came eye to eye with Tuesday. She didn’t growl at me, only wagged her tail— how would her little doggy brain know it was my fault? 

Carefully, I took a handful of ash from the fireplace and spread my repeated message across the carpet. I looked at May one more time, curled in on herself next to her dog, a blanket pulled tight around her. She looked thin, and small. Her hair was tangled, with a few new gray strands. She’d fallen asleep with her glasses on again.

I wiped my eyes and sat the broken picture below the same words from before. As I climbed back into the ceiling, I thumped my boot hard against the wall. I heard her stir. This time, I wasn’t the one to scream. 

Through all my self-hatred, it finally worked. 

“I can’t do it anymore,” I heard her sob to her sister, the other end of a late night phone call. “I’ll leave now and be there in the morning. I know— I know I should’ve come sooner. But I’m coming now.” A sick sense of relief filled me as I listened to her shoving things into a bag and cursing whatever had driven her out of her family house. 

Exhaustion, both emotional and physical, was catching up with me. As I slouched beside the attic vent I was eavesdropping from, I was already almost gone. Maybe I’d get a full night’s rest, or maybe I’d be eaten in my sleep. Either way, it was finally quiet.

My head snapped up. I had just enough time to jump to my feet before the tap-less silence was broken by the cracking of wood. The abomination burst through the hole I’d covered like a battering ram, and it wasn’t here to introduce itself this time. An enormous claw came down, missing my face by inches. 

I dodged as best I could, but as I rounded the corner of one of the piles of boxed junk, I lost my footing and came down hard on the floor. As powerful as the creature seemed, no one is immune to inertia. It barreled past where I’d fallen, its course corrected just enough to send it to the floor, but not on top of me. I yelped as it crashed halfway through the attic hatch, stuck and screeching. Tuesday began to bark wildly.

It was a headstart, and however short it was, I was taking it. I launched myself through the gaps in the walls and burst out of the crawlspace, the cover board shattering beneath me as I fell. 

I threw myself out of the closet, and for the first time, May and I met terrified eyes. Time seemed to stand still. In the back of my mind, I still lived in that first night. That song was still playing. Always playing. If I didn’t tell her, I could leave today…

“RUN! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, RUN!”

With the evidence clearly heard upstairs, she didn’t have time to disbelieve the source. She broke free of whatever fear had locked her in place, scooped up Tuesday, and turned to do just that. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end. She’d made it out. That’s all I cared about.

I wish I could tell you that’s what happened. But the sounds of flesh tearing and blood spraying wasn’t from my own chest. I opened my eyes, and regretted it immediately. The front door hung open, her hand still dangling loose just above the handle. Flakes of snow blew in, dyed red by the fountain of blood bubbling from beneath the claws in her chest. She coughed once, twice, then the creature sank its jaws into her head. I stood by, frozen. 

A sharp yip brought me out of my stupor, and as a fluffy ball of red and white came sprinting toward me, I bent down and caught her like some twisted umpire. The creature looked back at me, its face dripping with gore, and it laughed. I held Tuesday close as I scrambled back into the walls. 

It never came after me. I had to listen to it chewing for hours through the walls, losing what little was in my stomach to begin with. Eventually, the millions of little noises blended together, forming a giant whiteout that surrounded my brain. 

I spent three days like that, I think. Could’ve been longer. Maybe not. The world felt distant. All I did was cry, and try my best to clean the blood from Tuesday’s fur. I kept her alive. It was the absolute least I could do. 

“You’re a good dog,” I told her, whenever I could force out words, “such a good little dog.” Her chest heaved when I held her close, grief we shared. The kind that all living, loving things will know at least once. 

When the fog lifted, I began searching for a way out. The attic was freezing now, the roof cave-in filled with snow. I dug until my fingers went numb, but it wasn’t gonna happen. At some point, I hit ice, thick and blue. It didn’t make sense, but I was fucking done looking for sense. 

I crawled through the walls for hours, looking for a weak spot. Nothing. The destroyed attic hatch was a gamble. I wasn’t stupid enough to not call a mousetrap a mousetrap. As soon as I dropped down, a looming shadow and the smell of old blood sent me scrambling back up the unsteady ladder. 

The cops came once. A week had gone by before anyone took note of May’s absence. They swept around for an hour or two, and they left. I never saw them again. 

Her sister stayed longer, the one time she dared to step foot in her sister’s haunted house. She took some of the photographs, walking around with wide eyes and a nervous pace, like a wolf was breathing down her neck. I beat my fists against the walls and screamed when she left. 

I know I could leave, if I tried hard enough. There are those minute-long spaces where it’s crawling in and out the same way I did, taunting me, or when it’s devouring the corpse of another person it’s pulled into here in the dead of night like a predator. There are moments when Tuesday and I could make a break for it. I could use what little battery is left on my phone to try and call someone. Anyone. But I don’t.

The truth is, I’m still scared. I’m sorry. I know it’s selfish. 

I play it out constantly in my mind, the things that could happen. I might end up in the bulging gut along with May, and all the other dinners that no one cared enough about to miss. There’s also a jail cell/padded room waiting for me out there, somewhere. And then, there’s the simple return. I could wander out into the growing winter and freeze. None of it would have mattered in the end, and that scares me much more than hypothermia. 

That being said, I don’t want to die. Lives are still at stake, and not just the one buried in my cocoon of blankets. I don’t deserve to escape this nightmare, but I’ll do it for May. Once the ice begins to thaw, I’ll find her sister. I’ll figure out something. I won’t let this thing have me; I won’t let it win.

When I run for it, I’ll think about that summer day that feels like lifetimes ago. Before everything went wrong. I’ll think of a boy who held my face and called me brave, and I’ll try to prove it. I’ll flee this place like a rat off a sinking ship, and I’ll come back with retribution. I just have to make it through the cold…

I just have to make it through the cold.

1qex828,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1qex828/pasadena_moving_services_what_to_expect_and_how/,Pasadena Moving Services: What to Expect and How to Prepare,"Moving can be overwhelming, especially in a city like Pasadena where charm meets complexity. With its historic neighborhoods, bustling downtown, and a mix of modern apartments and old craftsman homes, relocating here presents some unique challenges. But with the right preparation and a reliable moving service, you can make the process smooth and even enjoyable. Let’s talk about what to expect and how you can set yourself up for a successful move.

**1. Understand Pasadena’s Neighborhoods**  
Each part of Pasadena has its own vibe and logistics. Whether you’re headed to the tree-lined streets of Bungalow Heaven or a condo near Old Town, it helps to choose a moving crew that knows the area. Some streets are narrow, parking is tight, and older homes may have stairs or limited access that require special handling.

**2. Plan Ahead—Seriously**  
Don’t wait until the last week to organize your move. About 4–6 weeks before your move date, start decluttering, gathering supplies, and scheduling your moving company. In Pasadena, availability can be tight, especially during the summer and at the beginning or end of the month.

**3. Don’t Skip the Packing Prep**  
If you’re doing the packing yourself, use high-quality boxes and label them by room and contents. Protect delicate items with bubble wrap or packing paper. For fragile or valuable items, consider letting the professionals handle those—they have the experience and materials to do it right.

**4. Reserve Parking in Advance**  
Some areas in Pasadena require a permit or advance notice for moving trucks to park near your home. Check with the city or your building management to avoid delays or fines on moving day.

**5. Ask About Specialty Items**  
Have a piano, antiques, or large furniture? Make sure your movers are equipped to handle these. The right service will have the tools and techniques to transport specialty items without damage.

When hiring **moving services in Pasadena**, preparation and local knowledge go a long way. Inspired by how local movers operate, it’s clear that those familiar with the city’s layout, regulations, and housing types can offer a much more efficient and worry-free move.

In the end, moving doesn’t have to be a hassle. With a little planning and the right help, you’ll be sipping coffee in your new Pasadena kitchen before you know it—stress-free and ready for your next chapter.",1,1768608871.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False
1qex5o8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGbWa508rWk,Blake Lively’s Latest Interview Suggests Career Pivot to Beauty Influencer: “I still don’t know what I do for a living”,"The day after Kristin Bender and Michael J. Gottlieb doxxed the home addresses of Justin Baldoni and Jamey Heath, Blake Lively released an interview about her Blake Brown hair product line.

You can watch the whole thing if you like, but it’s relatively uneventful. This is because, surprise! Lively actually stuck to a script for 30+ minutes. Maybe her deposition was the first time in her life she received training on how to act, and the lesson stuck enough for her to get through this podcast without breaking out the salad forks. I’ve transcribed what I think are the most interesting quotes below.

**Claims about Blake Brown’s performance**

(0:50) The podcaster, Jenny B. Fine, introduces Lively as “one of the most successful actresses of her generation, and she’s also one of the most successful beauty entrepreneurs.”

(1:02) Fine: “Her line, Blake Brown, launched at Target last year, and was the number one hair care launch in the history of the retailer. It’s gone on to garner exceptionally high repeat purchases.”

(6:59) Lively: “Our repeat purchase rate is two times the category average. 98% of people who try it say that they would purchase it again, which is unheard of.”

**Lively’s approach to business/creating**

(1:48) Lively: “I just love creating. I love building something from inception to seeing it through. That translates across the different businesses that I’m in, it translates into my personal life. Whether I’m baking a cake, or making a flower arrangement, or making a human, I love to create. And I’ve been fortunate to work with incredible brands and lend my face and my name, but really the thing that I find the most rewarding is to build and create something that I feel like isn’t necessarily out there.”

**Upcoming strategies we may see in Lively’s branding and career strategy**

*Bringing up the past: Met Gala*

(6:00) “I’m also a very shy person. Not great at posting. I don’t think I’ve ever posted a Met Gala, which I really need to do. I think all the time, oh shoot, I got to post a Met Gala. People are like, wait it was in May, and I’m like no, no, from 2018. I haven’t posted that one yet, I have to catch up.”

Fine: “There’s got to be a team for that.”

Lively: “I know, but I don’t have that. And so like my posting is very erratic. It’s like one in the morning, and there will be like eighteen posts, and then I don’t post for three months. But at least you know it’s me.”

*Looking into the future: Shifting away from acting*

(26:28) Lively: “I think that different people like to come into processes at different things. Some people like to discover something great. I still like discovering something great. Some people like to renovate. Some people like to build from the ground up. I’m very, very tactile. I never knew that I would be an actor. My parents are both very creative and very hands-on and very tactile. So I never knew exactly what industry I would be in. And also I grew up surrounded by actors, and was born and raised in Los Angeles, so I knew how mercurial and unstable that industry was. It felt like being a professional gambler. So I think that I’ve always, in the back of my mind, been trying to educate myself and have my hand in a lot of different pots, a lot of different careers, because the career I chose is such a mercurial one.”

(27:42) “I never knew what I would do for a living. I still don’t know what I’m going to do for a living. I hope that I never know. I hope that when I’m on my death bed, I still don’t know what I did for a living, because I did so many different things. I love that jack of all trades.”

**Lively’s references to giving birth (creatively) and sex status**

(1:36) Lively: “Actually, this child \[Blake Brown\] was born before some of my children. So I don’t know if I had four children, I still would have done this, because it was such an undertaking. This is probably my third child or so.”

(22:30) Lively: “There’s no reason we should be creating so much virgin plastic.” (referring to the product bottles being made from recycled materials)

**What Lively looks for in a business partner**

(25:05) Lively: “Honestly, I look for kind people. That is very, very important. These are the people that you’re stuck with, you’re in a marriage with these people. So I look for people who are kind, and respectful. And it’s not to say that there aren’t challenges, it’s not to say that you may not even disagree with a path that you may choose to go forward, but to be able to have someone who is respectful and communicative, you can deal with those obstacles together in a thoughtful way.

So that was really important to me. Someone who really cared about quality, and was uncompromising. Who wasn’t just trying to say, ‘Okay, let’s get the thing out there, let’s just try to make money and just churn something out for the sake of churning it out.’ They were truly interested in building something that was a legacy brand, and not something that was just like, let’s just make as much money as quickly as we can. So that’s really, really important to me, to have people who are thoughtful, and people who have a long-term vision versus a get-in, get-out, and don’t have a respect for, not just the process, but the people who you’re asking to join you in this journey, to buy your products.”

**Overall impressions**

* If you didn’t know who she was or what she’s done, she sounds decently professional and on-task for once. Expect to see more of this restrained, script-trained Lively in the press and at trial.
* I forgot to grab the quote, but she says “authorship” towards the end. A lot of this interview and its references to creating/building suggests an SEO erasure of her infamous Forbes summit rug-pull interview.
* Lively can’t claim horrible damages for Blake Brown and then tout its unprecedented success in the same breath (although I’m sure the argument will be that repeat purchase rate doesn’t account for losing first-time buyers).
* ~~Mr. Reynolds~~ Ms. Lively, do you see how stupid you look for pretending that using a birthing metaphor in creative contexts constitutes sexual harassment?
* The hypocrisy of Lively saying she seeks “kind,” “respectful,” “communicative” partners made my jaw drop the whole time I listened to it
* It’s official: Reynolds seems to be pulling the plug on her acting career and booting her off into the Gwyneth Goop influencer direction. There is actually very little focus on her acting career in this interview, they almost avoid it. It's mostly about the beauty business instead.

Edit: Ah shit, I forgot to add the part about her saying her favorite type of hair care is ocean water. No, I’m not making that up. She loves the way salt water feels in her hair 😂 it’s in the interview if you want to look for it (second half I believe)

Also she mentions how her and Reynolds are partners in everything and her example was her eagerly wanting feedback from him about how she makes his coffee…",28,1768608725.0,ItEndsWithLawsuits,51,0.87,False

We are back from a three-month trip through China and South-East Asia. We found Reddit to be invaluable when planning our trip. Wanted to give back to the community are sharing a list of tips from our experience.

About the type of travelers that we are. We are a couple in our late 30s who decided to spend a year traveling. We broke the year into segments so we could periodically return home, check on our house, and reset. In terms of budget, we fall somewhere in the middle. We are price conscious and do not like overpaying, but we are also happy to treat ourselves to some comfort or occasional luxury when it meaningfully improves the experience. We prefer to see things on our own, at our own pace, rather than with a group or a guide. We are also pretty active, enjoying doing things, even walking, rather than sitting by the pool.

**GENERAL**

**Packing and shopping**

A lot of advice insists on traveling with a backpack only. That might work for some, but it is not our style, and we were very glad we ignored that advice. While you can theoretically buy most things along the way, in practice it often requires detours to regular shopping centers, which eats into sightseeing time.

Traveling with a suitcase was surprisingly easy. Didi and Grab, the local equivalents of Uber, are inexpensive, and rolling a suitcase is far more comfortable than carrying weight on your back for months. Even when taking a bus, you would still go with a car to the bus stop. Having your own essentials, such as skincare products with known ingredients or clothing that fits if you are taller than average, saved us a lot of time. Buying cheap items only to discard them a few days later was also not our style, even if prices were low.

**Accommodation**

We booked a mix of homestays and hotels. If you are doing the same, it helps to consciously alternate comfort levels. We had a stretch of several homestays in a row and were exhausted by the end, wishing we had scheduled something more comfortable sooner.

With homestays, night temperature matters more than you might expect (we traveled in the cold season). Many houses rely on simple ventilation, often just a hole in the wall in the bathroom or bedroom. There is usually no heating, and cold nights can be uncomfortable. We were lucky to have brought a blanket. Another common quirk was wet bathrooms, meaning no shower screen and sometimes poor drainage. Even with flip-flops, having standing water everywhere felt unhygienic, and it required changing shoes every time you used the toilet. Hot water was available almost everywhere, but in some places it only stayed hot if the flow was extremely slow.

Laundry does not feel important when booking, but it matters over a long trip. Laundry services are cheap and easy to find, but we increasingly preferred places with a washing machine on site. Doing laundry ourselves was often faster and less disruptive than searching for a shop (just need to make sure that you have places to dry the clothes). In China, every hotel and homestay we stayed in had a washing machine, which seemed to be a standard, along with providing slippers.

**Food**  
We wanted to experience local cuisine and avoided places clearly catering to tourists, such as cafés serving avocado sandwiches. We usually followed locals. This led to interesting surprises, some excellent and some not so much.

I am a non-dairy vegetarian and my husband is an omnivore. Our default was to choose places serving meat and ask for adjustments. Dedicated vegetarian places were often clearly tourist-oriented. Many of the best spots specialize in a single dish, so we sometimes ordered from two different places.

We stayed away from fresh uncooked vegetables, were careful with iced drinks, and stuck to busy stalls or freshly cooked food. We did not avoid food poisoning entirely but only had a couple of mild episodes over three months.

Tibet and Vietnam were the hardest food-wise, largely due to broth-based dishes. China and Thailand were the most interesting in terms of spice and flavor diversity. Southeast Asia overall was a disappointment for us food-wise, with many dishes relying on similar fish or soy sauce profiles. For someone who eats very spicy food in the US, most dishes were mild. Condiments could help but were not always available, and repeated sauces made very different dishes taste similar.

**Air quality**

Air quality in Southeast Asia was a shock after China. In northern regions, we deliberately picked the beginning of the dry season to avoid smoke from agricultural burning. What no advice we read beforehand mentioned was that air clarity would still be poor regardless, largely due to motorbike traffic. Rubbish burning was also common. The air quality index often sat in the moderate range, but it was enough to dull views. It was genuinely hard to take in spectacular scenery through a persistent layer of haze.

**Internet**

We used eSIMs everywhere. They were cheap and easy to set up ahead of time.

**Smoking**

You have to accept a baseline level of daily smoke inhalation. Smoking is extremely common, especially among men. Pay close attention when booking accommodation, as a “smoking room” genuinely means with an awful smoke odour. Ideally, choose hotels that are fully non-smoking. In all the countries smoking was socially acceptable. The worst was in China, where people would be puffing right next to you without a second thought (often right next to a no smoking sign). It was somewhat better in Cambodia and Laos, with Vietnam falling in-between. What frustrated us most was seeing tourists ignore the etiquette, too, and smoking too close to other people.

 

**China**

**Flights and trains**

Flight schedules are centrally dictated and can change abruptly between high and low season. In Tibet, low season effectively starts in October due to cold weather, which directly impacts flight availability and pricing. When we tried to book a flight from Lhasa to mainland China, the route we wanted was classified as low season. We could no longer fly to Lijiang and had to reroute to Shangri-La instead. Even then, flight options dropped from four per day to one, at roughly double the price. Aim for high season flights whenever possible.

Train tickets were a mixed experience. For one long-distance route we pressed the purchase button multiple times, thinking we had tickets, but ended up with none. We ended up needing to buy less preferred time. For most popular routes, however, booking was straightforward.

We used the official railway app rather than [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) to avoid extra fees. Once you book the first ticket, the rest is intuitive. The mobile app is significantly better than the website. You can change a ticket once, which means you can book a second-best option and keep checking for your preferred train or time. You can also effectively “test buy” tickets a few times per day to see how full trains are. Seat selection is not manual; seats are automatically allocated, generally starting with the best available option, so booking ahead for long journeys is strongly recommended.

**Documents**

Carry your passport everywhere, including places where you might not expect to need it. You will have to show it for all train journeys and for entering attractions, where the passport effectively functions as your ticket.

**Maps and navigation**

No map app worked consistently well. Trip.com maps were the most reliable overall. Apple Maps was usable to a degree, but many searches returned no results, even for popular attractions. Maps.me was inaccurate and not very helpful. Google Maps did not work properly, and even when partially accessible through an eSIM with built-in VPN, many places such as restaurants were missing or had zero reviews. Our workaround was to search for attractions within Trip.com and then explore nearby places from there, accepting some level of decision fatigue as the trade-off.

**Paying**

Alipay worked better for us than WeChat Pay, mainly because of its built-in translation features. You can scan menus, translate them, and even order directly through Alipay. WeChat Pay, however, has a small built-in map that is useful when locating chain stores. For example, the local Starbucks equivalent, Luckin Coffee, was heavily subsidized during our visit, with the first latte of the day costing 10 yuan.

Once you have paid a few times, the process becomes second nature. The key thing to remember is to turn off your VPN before paying. The eSIM itself is fine, but an active VPN can cause the payment to be treated as an international transaction and rejected.

WeChat Pay has a daily limit of 3,000 yuan. Alipay has a per-transaction limit of 5,000 yuan, but you can make multiple transactions. If you hit the limit, you are blocked for the rest of the day. This happened to us when paying for our Tibet tour. There is also a 3 percent fee on transactions of 200 yuan or more. Cards are often not accepted, so even with the fee, Alipay or WeChat Pay is still better than PayPal, which would charge around 4.5%.

Set up both apps before entering China. It is significantly harder once you are already there. Ideally, test them in advance by making a real payment. Paying a deposit for our Tibet tour turned out to be a very useful dry run.

Link more than one card to each app. We had several occasions where my husband’s Chase card was blocked, likely due to aggressive fraud protection, while my app worked fine with a different card. In short, diversify payment methods and apps. Assume you cannot buy even a bottle of water without internet access. Cash is rarely accepted.

**Crowds**

Crowds reach an entirely different scale compared to what we were used to. That said, every place was noticeably less crowded in the morning. Starting around 8:00 works well, as most attractions do not open earlier anyway.

**Toilets**

Contrary to many warnings, toilets were generally better than expected. While most stalls are squat toilets, there is usually at least one or two seated toilets, and the accessible stall is almost always a regular one. Toilet paper was typically available from a dispenser near the sinks rather than inside each stall. Tourist areas had plenty of toilets. Conditions were somewhat worse in Tibet, especially in more remote areas.

**High altitude**

Unless you plan to stop at intermediate places between Xining and Lhasa, where there is little to do, the ascent is very fast (even in the train). We had prior experience at similar altitudes in Peru without issues, but Tibet hit us hard. My husband recovered after sleeping a few hours on the train but I had to resort to taking the high-altitude pills.

There is a reason the first day of any organized tour is dedicated to acclimatization. We chose not to take Diamox preventively. After a rough night with severe headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and a swollen-brain feeling, I started taking it. I took 250 mg on the first day, as prescribed by my doctor, and then continued with 125 mg daily, following my husband’s doctor’s advice, until Everest Base Camp. I considered stopping but decided not to risk missing the highlight of the trip. The only side effect I noticed was brief tingling sensations a few times per day.

**Other notes**

Power banks are checked at airports for the CCC certificate. We also wished we had packed hand warmers for Everest Base Camp. Evenings were extremely windy and mornings freezing, which made photography difficult even with gloves.

**Vietnam**

**Restaurants & services**

Coffee is Vietnamese-style by default, meaning it usually comes with condensed milk. Despite many restaurants advertising fast food in their windows, service is slow across the board. Even coffee often takes a long time.

**Money**

All ATMs charge some kind of fee. The only bank that doesn’t at least charge the withdrawal fee on foreign card is the VPBank. Withdrawing cash is unavoidable as it is the dominant payment method—even established places rarely accept credit cards. Having said that, many tour operators accept dollars so you can save on withdrawals that way if you are travelling from the US.

**Transport**

We experienced both regular sleeper buses and higher-end options. The slightly more expensive buses, often just a few dollars more, are significantly more comfortable, with two rows instead of three and wider seats that allow multiple sleeping positions. Limousine buses are also worth the upgrade. Same goes for luxury vs non-luxury vans. We also took a couple of public busses, which was fun. In any case, expect to waste a lot of time. Many companies provide hotel pick-up service, which means driving for up to 1h around the city (depending where you are dropped off). All of the busses would stop for 15-30 minutes for toilet break and shopping. Also, all of the busses that we took had an unexpected stop to pick-up some cargo along the way. There was food from restaurants, living fish, metal rods, and a huge aquarium among some of what we have seen.

Booking transport through excursions or homestays worked best. They handle connections and usually arrange hotel pickup and drop-off, which is easier and less stressful. Sometimes they also know about local buses not aimed at tourists, which can be the only viable connection, as we learned when traveling from Mo Cay to Ho Chi Minh City.

Driving style is hectic across all bus types, with hard acceleration, sudden braking, aggressive overtaking, and fast cornering. The roads are not the greatest either. This makes long journeys unpleasant. We wished trains reached more of the places we wanted to visit.

Ride-hailing was unreliable when traveling from rural areas into towns. For example, we waited 30 minutes for a ride from Ta Van to Sapa, though we had no issues going in the opposite direction.

**Thailand**

**North Thailand: Chiang Mai 24–27 Nov, Chiang Dao 28–29 Nov, Chiang Rai 30 Nov–3 Dec (small slow boat from Laos border)**

**Hiking**

We were excited about hiking and natural scenery but ended up disappointed. Entrance fees for foreigners are often five times higher than for locals, which is frustrating but understandable. More problematic were the additional requirements: special permits, designated transport to trailheads, or mandatory guides, even for easy hikes on wooden paths. This was not the nature experience that we wanted to have so ended up skipping many of the national parks. One place that we liked was Doi ang khang—it was free and you could hike on your own.

**Prices**

Pricing felt inconsistent. Freshly prepared street food cost around 60 baht, roughly half the price of a chocolate bar in a supermarket. An iced coffee was around 80 baht, while a cocktail in a reputable place cost about 300 baht, the same as a full hour-long massage. Cosmetics were disproportionately expensive, often matching or exceeding US prices. There were some differences on specific products between the SEA countries (for example depending on import tax rates for wine) but the surprises in the relationship of prices was true for all of the countries.

**Driving**

Driving was straightforward—this was the only place where we had a car. Traffic is left-sided, and somewhat less hectic than Vietnam or Laos. Roads were decent, too.

**Restaurants**

Besides China, we had the most interesting food. It was worth venturing beyond tourist hotspots to try dishes other than pad Thai. The general low spiciness level was a surprise. Vegetarian options were reasonably easy to find, and alternative milks such as soy and oat were widely available, even in small coffee shops. That was a nice change from Vietnam.

 

**North Laos**

**Luang Prabang 4–8 Dec, Nong Khiaw 9–12 Dec (flight from Luang Prabang to Cambodia)**

**General**

Laos felt like a mix of Thailand and Vietnam, but with less intensity. I see why some people recommend skipping it. We are glad we didn’t—it was enjoyable for us. The highlight was the slow boat on the Mekong from the Thai border.

**Roads and transport**

We traveled from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw by minivan. It was extremely bumpy, very slow, and uncomfortable. This single experience explained why most tourists now take the train to Vientiane. Even short distances felt draining due to road quality.

**Air pollution**

Because of lighter traffic, Nong Khiaw had noticeably cleaner air.

**Food**

Curries were more common than in Vietnam, but otherwise menus were very similar everywhere, with little regional variation.

 

**Cambodia**

**Siem Reap 13–20 Dec, Phnom Penh 21–22 Dec, Kampot 23–25 Dec (bus via land border to South Vietnam)**

**Transport**

We had only three legs. A flight from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh involved a long Phnom Penh has a very cheap airport bus (1 USD). You have to walk through the parking lot to reach it, but it is faster than tuk-tuks and has few stops.

The bus from Phnom Penh to Kampot was easy, as was Kampot to Can Tho. We were surprised by how good the roads were overall.

In Siem Reap and Kampot we rented scooters for day trips. It was super easy and gave us the independence that we like.

Drivers rarely honked. They flashed lights instead, which made traffic feel calmer than in Vietnam or Laos.

**Payments**

Cards were accepted more often than in Vietnam or Laos, but cash was still useful for small purchases.

**Angkor**

Angkor is worth spending more time there if you can. Some temples are one-and-done. Others can give you a different experience if you pay multiple visits at different times of day. We revisited Ta Prohm just before closing and were completely alone. The atmosphere, animal sounds, and cicadas made it one of the most memorable moments of the trip.

**Vendors and people**

We stayed away from hot spots with stalls but Cambodia and Vietnam had more persistent vendors, asking you to look or come in.

Interestingly, people didn’t feel as warm. We had a couple of unkind encounters (things like you sit at a table while waiting for food. Once you get it a next-stall vendor with drinks tells you that you need to buy something from her because it is her table. We ask the food vendor where can we sit, she gives us a shrug, and actively ignores us).

There was also a lot of grudge against the neighbor countries. We have heard from multiple people (driver, guide, etc) unprompted negative comments about Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese. There is understandable trauma but a lot of negativity nonetheless.

**Climate**

That was the first southern region that we visited and it hit us hard. I can’t imagine the humidity and the heat outside of the “cold” season. I was actually out for a couple of days due to heat exhaustion (which I didn’t expect to hit me because it wasn’t that bad and we were avoiding sun anyway.

1qewxa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1qewxa4/could_this_be_gallstones/,Could this be gallstones?,"Hi, guys!

I'm a 43-year-old woman with a family history of gallstones, but only my maternal aunt afaik. 

For a few years, I've had bloating gas pain in my chest and back under my ribs after eating, especially before bed. Burping after meals is common. I've vomited a few times late at night after painful abdominal gas the past two years. Acid reflux is less common, but not unheard of. 

This would come in waves. I wouldn't have symptoms for weeks or months, then I would be sick for a week or two. 

I talked to my doctor about it last year. She didn't seem worried. Just told me to eat more fiber and yogurt, and to avoid coffee, which is a huge trigger for me. 

Today I had my annual physical. My urine tested positive for bilirubin. There's no lab value. Just positive. 

For context, I have terrible medical anxiety, so I hadn't had water in 13 hours or food for about 36 hours. So stressed I wasn't taking care of myself. I was dehydrated. My urine was darker than usual. 

Here are my urine values: 

**urobilinogen****:** .2 mg/dL (range <2 mg/dL)

**bilirubin****:** positive (no value)

**hemoglobin:** trace (no value)

**Blood values:**

**Bilirubin, total:** .6 mg/dL (range 0.0 - 1.4 mg/dL)

**AST/SGOT:** 20 U/L (range 6-43 U/L)

**ALT:** 13 (range 0-55 U/L) 

To sum up, blood liver values look normal, urobilinogen looks normal, but positive urine test for bilirubin. 

I've messaged my doctor, but I won't hear back until Tuesday because of MLK Day. I hope she'll agree to a retest. 

But in the meantime, I'm freaking out a bit and want to talk it through. 

Any ideas?

I’ve spent the last 15 years in the gambling table of this industry. I’ve been the guy sitting in meetings in Malta and Curacao, helping major operators figure out how to squeeze an extra 2% margin out of your Saturday night spins. I’ve seen the pivot from the early days of sketchy offshore sites to the tech-heavy, AI-driven landscape we’re living in here in 2026.

I’m a local spent most of my life between the coffee shops of Gastown and the rainy streets of Victoria. I know the BCLC (British Columbia Lottery Corporation) has been pushing PlayNow as the ""only"" option for years, but let’s be real: as we hit 2026, the gap between the ""official"" provincial site and the international big boys has become a canyon. With the new Gaming Control Act officially in force as of April 2026, and the Independent Gambling Control Office (IGCO) finally taking the reins, BC is in a weird spot. We're in a ""gray market"" that’s safer than ever, but more complex to navigate.

2026 is the year of the ""Instant Payout."" If a casino makes you wait more than two hours for your Interac or Crypto transfer, they are living in 2018. This guide is for the people who want to skip the corporate fluff and get to the high RTPs and the no-wagering bonuses.

# Why 2026 Matters: The BC Legal & Payment Shift

If you've been following the news from the Legislature in Victoria, you know 2026 is a massive year. The IGCO is now the independent sheriff in town, separating the ""regulator"" from the ""operator"" (BCLC). This is a move inspired by iGaming Ontario, and while we aren't quite as ""open"" as Ontario yet, the enforcement has shifted toward player protection rather than just blocking sites.

In 2026, the payment landscape in BC has moved beyond simple credit cards. Most of us are using Instant Interac, MuchBetter, or Solana/Bitcoin for zero-latency transactions. The Responsible Gambling Council has also pushed for AI-driven tools that are now standard on these top-tier sites, helping you track your ""tilt"" before you even realize you're chasing.

# The Unfiltered Reviews: 15 Years of Insider Knowledge

# 1. [**Winshark**](https://securegame.click/winshark-reddit): my Best choice for Redditor

Winshark is the ""moneyball"" of casinos. Behind the scenes, they use a massive data engine to track player behavior. While that sounds scary, for a smart player, it's a win. Their AI-driven lobby actually prioritizes games with high Return to Player (RTP) percentages based on your specific playstyle. If you’re a ""grinder"" who likes low volatility, the site adjusts to show you the best NetEnt or Play’n GO titles for that strategy.

**Performance Data:**

* **Average RTP:** 97.2% (The ""highest payout percentage casino"" in my internal testing).
* **KYC Verification Speed:** In 2026, they use automated document scanning. If your BC ID is clear, you’re verified in under 15 minutes.
* **Mobile Stability:** 4.8/5. They don't have a dedicated app, but their PWA (Progressive Web App) is faster than most native apps on the Rogers 5G network in Vancouver.

**The Catch:**

They have a 3x deposit turnover rule. This is my biggest gripe. If you deposit $100, you have to wager $300 before you can withdraw, even if you don't take a bonus. It’s an anti-money laundering measure, but it's annoying for casual players.

# 2. [**TonyBet**](https://securegame.click/tonybet-reddit): The Regulatory Gold Standard

TonyBet is the casino for the person who actually reads the Terms and Conditions. Because they operate in highly regulated markets like the UK and are compliant with Ontario's standards, their SSL Encryption and fund segregation are top-notch. They are frequently nominated for EGR Awards because they don't play games with your money. If you win $50k on a parlay during a Canucks game, they pay. No ""technical error"" excuses.

**Performance Data:**

* **Withdrawal Time:** Very consistent. Not the ""fastest"" in terms of minutes, but always lands within 12 hours for e-wallets.
* **Game Variety:** Massive. Over 6,000 slots and a live dealer section powered by Evolution that includes the new 2026 ""Vancouver-Native"" tables.

**The Catch:**

Their wagering requirements on the welcome bonus can be a slog often 50x. It’s ""honest"" math, but it's a mountain to climb if you're not a high-volume player.

# 3. [**WildTokyo**](https://securegame.click/wildtokyo-reddit): Impressive Style

WildTokyo is where the tech-heavy BC crowd hangs out. In 2026, they fully integrated VR-integrated live dealers. If you have a Meta Quest or Apple Vision Pro, you can literally walk into their ""Cyber-Tokyo"" lobby. My 2 cents? It’s cool for 20 minutes, then you just want to see the cards. But from a backend perspective, they have the best RNG (Random Number Generator) transparency I've seen. You can check the ""seed"" of your spins to prove the fairness.

**Performance Data:**

* **Instant Withdrawals:** They are aggressive with Interac. I’ve seen payouts hit a Vancity account in 22 minutes.
* **Support:** 24/7 live chat that actually uses humans, not just AI bots.

**The Catch:**

The UI is bright. If you're playing at 2 AM in a dark room, it’s like looking into the sun. They need a ""Dark Mode"" that actually works.

# 4. [**RollingSlots**](https://securegame.click/rollingslots-reddit): The Loyalty King

RollingSlots is built for the long-term player. Most casinos give you a big ""Welcome"" and then forget you exist. RollingSlots uses a ""Vinyl"" loyalty system where you earn coins for every spin. The secret? These coins can be traded in a shop for no-wagering bonuses and free spins. I’ve seen players who have ""hacked"" the loyalty system to essentially get a permanent 2% cashback on all their play.

**Performance Data:**

* **Game Providers:** They carry everything Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Yggdrasil.
* **Withdrawal:** Solid. 2-3 hours for crypto, a bit longer for cards.

**The Catch:**

Their ""Rolling"" theme can be a bit cheesy. If you don't like rock music references, the branding will grate on you after a while.

# 5. [**Slotavader**](https://securegame.click/slotsvader-reddit): The Volatility Specialist

Slotavader is the ""new kid"" for 2026. They specialize in high-volatility ""Buy Bonus"" slots. Their unique feature is the ""Force"" Volatility Toggle. You can actually adjust the risk level on certain proprietary games. Want a 99% RTP with tiny wins? Or a 92% RTP with a 50,000x jackpot potential? You choose. This is a ""Hot take,"" but I think this is the future of the industry.

**Performance Data:**

* **Speed:** They use a proprietary payout processor that bypasses many of the ""pending withdrawal periods"" you see elsewhere.
* **Trust:** Newer brand, so they are still building their ""street cred,"" but they hold a solid Curacao and Anjouan license.

**The Catch:**

Because they are so focused on high-volatility, it is very easy to blow through a bankroll. This is NOT the site for a casual $20 player.

# How to bypass pending withdrawal periods in BC

If you want your money *now*, you have to play the system. Here is the step-by-step for 2026:

1. **Skip the Credit Card:** Don't use your Visa or Mastercard for deposits. Banks in BC (like RBC or TD) still sometimes flag these, leading to manual reviews. Use Interac e-Transfer or a Crypto Wallet.
2. **The ""Pre-KYC"" Move:** Don't wait until you win. As soon as you sign up, go to the ""Verification"" tab. Upload your BC Driver's License and a utility bill from BC Hydro or FortisBC immediately. A verified account is a fast-paying account.
3. **Choose ""No-Sticky"" Bonuses:** Look for bonuses where your ""Real Money"" and ""Bonus Money"" are separate. If you hit a big win with your real cash, you can often forfeit the bonus and withdraw your winnings instantly without finishing the wagering requirements.
4. **The Live Chat Ping:** Once you hit ""Withdraw,"" pop into the Live Chat. Politely tell them: *""I’m a verified player from BC, just submitted a withdrawal via Interac. Can you ensure it's pushed to the processor?""* This often moves your request to the top of the pile.

# Responsible Gambling: Advice from a 15-Year Pro

I’ve seen people lose houses. I’ve seen the ""dark side"" of the RNG. If you aren't managing your bankroll, you aren't playing you're just donating.

* **The ""Beer Rule"":** Don't gamble if you've been hitting the local craft beers too hard. Your decision-making drops off a cliff.
* **Use the AI Tools:** In 2026, all five sites above have ""AI-Guardian"" tools. Set a ""Loss Limit"" and a ""Session Limit."" The AI will actually block you from the site if it detects ""desperation betting"" (suddenly doubling your stakes after a loss).
* **GameSense:** Remember that BC has a great resource in GameSense. If you feel like the fun has stopped, it has. Reach out to the BC Problem Gambling Help Line at 1-888-795-6111.

# People Also Ask

**Which online casino has the fastest withdrawal in British Columbia?**

As of 2026, WildTokyo and Winshark are the winners. If your KYC is completed, payouts via Interac or Crypto generally arrive in under 45 minutes.

**How do I find the highest payout percentage casinos?**

Look for the published RTP (Return to Player) data. Sites like Winshark and TonyBet are transparent about this. In 2026, a ""good"" average RTP for a casino is anything over 96.5%.

**Is it safe to use Crypto for gambling in BC?**

Yes, and in 2026, it’s often safer than traditional banking. It bypasses the ""Gambling"" descriptors on your bank statement and offers the fastest transaction speeds. Just ensure you are using a secure wallet and not keeping your entire bankroll on the casino's site.

**What is the best way to bypass pending withdrawal periods?**

The best way is to play at sites like Slotavader or WildTokyo which have removed ""holding periods"" entirely for verified players. Always finish your KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before you start playing.

**Are these sites legal under the 2026 Gaming Control Act?**

They operate in a ""gray market."" While they are licensed internationally (Malta, Curacao, Kahnawake), they are not ""locally"" licensed by the IGCO yet. However, it is not illegal for BC residents to play on these platforms, and they offer much better odds than the provincial monopoly.

Between flight school, college and my job I literally have zero free time where I’m not trying to decompress from my day which makes going out really obnoxious.

I just feel out of place with dating culture. I’m not into the performative, formal date vibe. I connect best when it’s real conversation and consistent time together. Coffee and walks, cooking something simple, bookstore runs, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. Then feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. I’m the same way.

I just don’t understand how all this modern performative nonsense that’s called dating these days works, and I don’t want to I just want to find my person, not having some stupid roster or whatever.

I don’t know why it’s so hard to find someone like this, that just wants to fall in love and find their person. But I’m hoping that’s you!

Some of my interests/things about me:

Planes - I’m a pilot and I want to be an airline pilot in the future

Cars - I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about a random niche topic

Soccer - I love fc Barcelona and obviously if I was the coach they’d win every match.

I study computer science at UMD

I’m currently a rated private pilot going for my instrument rating

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment and loyalty above all else, if you aren’t going to commit to me and be fiercely loyal to me, then quite simply you don’t deserve my commitment and loyalty.

Quite literally I will yap about anything and everything, I’m kind of ambiverted but once I open up I will literally not stop talking and you will be the center of my attention for the rest of time basically.

I’m looking for someone that’s between 18-22, no older and especially not younger. US/Canada or Western Europe only for long distance.

If this sounds like you and you’re open to talking, feel free to message me! I can’t wait to get to know you! Just so I know you read the entire post start the conversation with the word purple.",1,1768608003.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

so I am doing my first sit currently. Chill vibe from both sides from the beginning, I'd say. Pleasant welcome, all is more than well. Dog is perfect. My room is great, clean, smells nice.

We agreed I will come and leave one day prior/after the needed sit with the information that the owner lives alone on the profile.

Late evening upon my arrival day, an owner's friend is picking up sth at her place, they work a bit and I realize and ask if the male friend is sleeping there. They say yes. I was tired, but felt very uncomfortable with a man in the house. During the night I heard schmegs noises.  


Then the next morning. I am alone. I check the cleanliness. I almost threw up. The toilet stinks very bad, brown stains around, inside, outside, you get it. I had to go out ASAP and chill and on my way back I bought antibacterial wipes and used the owner's toilet cleaner product as well. I already cleaned it. Another toilet I will leave like that and will take pics.

I wanna make myself the tea and the kettle is full of white gunk from water being boiled. But like heavy. Till black stripes are there I couldn't clean. I used the vinegar to clean it that I had found.

I wanted to reheat my coffee, I open the microwave and that thing is dirty as hell.

Fridge is full, I have zero space to put any food there. Just like pile it.

Dishes - washed and also piled like a mountain.

Then I left the house ASAP to make myself feel better and enjoy the location.

I have been feeling tummy sick all day and night now, had to buy pills. I think it is from that environment...

I cleaned/will clean the surfaces I need to touch but I will not clean the whole place. That is not my job. This place needs a deep clean.

I feel tired cos of my tummy and have to cut back on my plans here :(

I should have a sit in a few weeks and I feel discouraged to continue sitting at someone's house.

About the type of travelers that we are. We are a couple in our late 30s who decided to spend a year traveling. We broke the year into segments so we could periodically return home, check on our house, and reset. In terms of budget, we fall somewhere in the middle. We are price conscious and do not like overpaying, but we are also happy to treat ourselves to some comfort or occasional luxury when it meaningfully improves the experience. We prefer to see things on our own, at our own pace, rather than with a group or a guide. We are also pretty active, enjoying doing things, even walking, rather than sitting by the pool.

**GENERAL**

**Packing and shopping**

A lot of advice insists on traveling with a backpack only. That might work for some, but it is not our style, and we were very glad we ignored that advice. While you can theoretically buy most things along the way, in practice it often requires detours to regular shopping centers, which eats into sightseeing time.

Traveling with a suitcase was surprisingly easy. Didi and Grab, the local equivalents of Uber, are inexpensive, and rolling a suitcase is far more comfortable than carrying weight on your back for months. Even when taking a bus, you would still go with a car to the bus stop. Having your own essentials, such as skincare products with known ingredients or clothing that fits if you are taller than average, saved us a lot of time. Buying cheap items only to discard them a few days later was also not our style, even if prices were low.

**Accommodation**

We booked a mix of homestays and hotels. If you are doing the same, it helps to consciously alternate comfort levels. We had a stretch of several homestays in a row and were exhausted by the end, wishing we had scheduled something more comfortable sooner.

With homestays, night temperature matters more than you might expect (we traveled in the cold season). Many houses rely on simple ventilation, often just a hole in the wall in the bathroom or bedroom. There is usually no heating, and cold nights can be uncomfortable. We were lucky to have brought a blanket. Another common quirk was wet bathrooms, meaning no shower screen and sometimes poor drainage. Even with flip-flops, having standing water everywhere felt unhygienic, and it required changing shoes every time you used the toilet. Hot water was available almost everywhere, but in some places it only stayed hot if the flow was extremely slow.

Laundry does not feel important when booking, but it matters over a long trip. Laundry services are cheap and easy to find, but we increasingly preferred places with a washing machine on site. Doing laundry ourselves was often faster and less disruptive than searching for a shop (just need to make sure that you have places to dry the clothes). In China, every hotel and homestay we stayed in had a washing machine, which seemed to be a standard, along with providing slippers.

**Food**  
We wanted to experience local cuisine and avoided places clearly catering to tourists, such as cafés serving avocado sandwiches. We usually followed locals. This led to interesting surprises, some excellent and some not so much.

I am a non-dairy vegetarian and my husband is an omnivore. Our default was to choose places serving meat and ask for adjustments. Dedicated vegetarian places were often clearly tourist-oriented. Many of the best spots specialize in a single dish, so we sometimes ordered from two different places.

We stayed away from fresh uncooked vegetables, were careful with iced drinks, and stuck to busy stalls or freshly cooked food. We did not avoid food poisoning entirely but only had a couple of mild episodes over three months.

Tibet and Vietnam were the hardest food-wise, largely due to broth-based dishes. China and Thailand were the most interesting in terms of spice and flavor diversity. Southeast Asia overall was a disappointment for us food-wise, with many dishes relying on similar fish or soy sauce profiles. For someone who eats very spicy food in the US, most dishes were mild. Condiments could help but were not always available, and repeated sauces made very different dishes taste similar.

**Air quality**

Air quality in Southeast Asia was a shock after China. In northern regions, we deliberately picked the beginning of the dry season to avoid smoke from agricultural burning. What no advice we read beforehand mentioned was that air clarity would still be poor regardless, largely due to motorbike traffic. Rubbish burning was also common. The air quality index often sat in the moderate range, but it was enough to dull views. It was genuinely hard to take in spectacular scenery through a persistent layer of haze.

**Internet**

We used eSIMs everywhere. They were cheap and easy to set up ahead of time.

**Smoking**

You have to accept a baseline level of daily smoke inhalation. Smoking is extremely common, especially among men. Pay close attention when booking accommodation, as a “smoking room” genuinely means with an awful smoke odour. Ideally, choose hotels that are fully non-smoking. In all the countries smoking was socially acceptable. The worst was in China, where people would be puffing right next to you without a second thought (often right next to a no smoking sign). It was somewhat better in Cambodia and Laos, with Vietnam falling in-between. What frustrated us most was seeing tourists ignore the etiquette, too, and smoking too close to other people.

 

**China**

**Flights and trains**

Flight schedules are centrally dictated and can change abruptly between high and low season. In Tibet, low season effectively starts in October due to cold weather, which directly impacts flight availability and pricing. When we tried to book a flight from Lhasa to mainland China, the route we wanted was classified as low season. We could no longer fly to Lijiang and had to reroute to Shangri-La instead. Even then, flight options dropped from four per day to one, at roughly double the price. Aim for high season flights whenever possible.

Train tickets were a mixed experience. For one long-distance route we pressed the purchase button multiple times, thinking we had tickets, but ended up with none. We ended up needing to buy less preferred time. For most popular routes, however, booking was straightforward.

We used the official railway app rather than [Trip.com](http://trip.com/) to avoid extra fees. Once you book the first ticket, the rest is intuitive. The mobile app is significantly better than the website. You can change a ticket once, which means you can book a second-best option and keep checking for your preferred train or time. You can also effectively “test buy” tickets a few times per day to see how full trains are. Seat selection is not manual; seats are automatically allocated, generally starting with the best available option, so booking ahead for long journeys is strongly recommended.

**Documents**

Carry your passport everywhere, including places where you might not expect to need it. You will have to show it for all train journeys and for entering attractions, where the passport effectively functions as your ticket.

**Maps and navigation**

No map app worked consistently well. Trip.com maps were the most reliable overall. Apple Maps was usable to a degree, but many searches returned no results, even for popular attractions. Maps.me was inaccurate and not very helpful. Google Maps did not work properly, and even when partially accessible through an eSIM with built-in VPN, many places such as restaurants were missing or had zero reviews. Our workaround was to search for attractions within Trip.com and then explore nearby places from there, accepting some level of decision fatigue as the trade-off.

**Paying**

Alipay worked better for us than WeChat Pay, mainly because of its built-in translation features. You can scan menus, translate them, and even order directly through Alipay. WeChat Pay, however, has a small built-in map that is useful when locating chain stores. For example, the local Starbucks equivalent, Luckin Coffee, was heavily subsidized during our visit, with the first latte of the day costing 10 yuan.

Once you have paid a few times, the process becomes second nature. The key thing to remember is to turn off your VPN before paying. The eSIM itself is fine, but an active VPN can cause the payment to be treated as an international transaction and rejected.

WeChat Pay has a daily limit of 3,000 yuan. Alipay has a per-transaction limit of 5,000 yuan, but you can make multiple transactions. If you hit the limit, you are blocked for the rest of the day. This happened to us when paying for our Tibet tour. There is also a 3 percent fee on transactions of 200 yuan or more. Cards are often not accepted, so even with the fee, Alipay or WeChat Pay is still better than PayPal, which would charge around 4.5%.

Set up both apps before entering China. It is significantly harder once you are already there. Ideally, test them in advance by making a real payment. Paying a deposit for our Tibet tour turned out to be a very useful dry run.

Link more than one card to each app. We had several occasions where my husband’s Chase card was blocked, likely due to aggressive fraud protection, while my app worked fine with a different card. In short, diversify payment methods and apps. Assume you cannot buy even a bottle of water without internet access. Cash is rarely accepted.

**Crowds**

Crowds reach an entirely different scale compared to what we were used to. That said, every place was noticeably less crowded in the morning. Starting around 8:00 works well, as most attractions do not open earlier anyway.

**Toilets**

Contrary to many warnings, toilets were generally better than expected. While most stalls are squat toilets, there is usually at least one or two seated toilets, and the accessible stall is almost always a regular one. Toilet paper was typically available from a dispenser near the sinks rather than inside each stall. Tourist areas had plenty of toilets. Conditions were somewhat worse in Tibet, especially in more remote areas.

**High altitude**

Unless you plan to stop at intermediate places between Xining and Lhasa, where there is little to do, the ascent is very fast (even in the train). We had prior experience at similar altitudes in Peru without issues, but Tibet hit us hard. My husband recovered after sleeping a few hours on the train but I had to resort to taking the high-altitude pills.

There is a reason the first day of any organized tour is dedicated to acclimatization. We chose not to take Diamox preventively. After a rough night with severe headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and a swollen-brain feeling, I started taking it. I took 250 mg on the first day, as prescribed by my doctor, and then continued with 125 mg daily, following my husband’s doctor’s advice, until Everest Base Camp. I considered stopping but decided not to risk missing the highlight of the trip. The only side effect I noticed was brief tingling sensations a few times per day.

**Other notes**

Power banks are checked at airports for the CCC certificate. We also wished we had packed hand warmers for Everest Base Camp. Evenings were extremely windy and mornings freezing, which made photography difficult even with gloves.

**Vietnam**

**Restaurants & services**

Coffee is Vietnamese-style by default, meaning it usually comes with condensed milk. Despite many restaurants advertising fast food in their windows, service is slow across the board. Even coffee often takes a long time.

**Money**

All ATMs charge some kind of fee. The only bank that doesn’t at least charge the withdrawal fee on foreign card is the VPBank. Withdrawing cash is unavoidable as it is the dominant payment method—even established places rarely accept credit cards. Having said that, many tour operators accept dollars so you can save on withdrawals that way if you are travelling from the US.

**Transport**

We experienced both regular sleeper buses and higher-end options. The slightly more expensive buses, often just a few dollars more, are significantly more comfortable, with two rows instead of three and wider seats that allow multiple sleeping positions. Limousine buses are also worth the upgrade. Same goes for luxury vs non-luxury vans. We also took a couple of public busses, which was fun. In any case, expect to waste a lot of time. Many companies provide hotel pick-up service, which means driving for up to 1h around the city (depending where you are dropped off). All of the busses would stop for 15-30 minutes for toilet break and shopping. Also, all of the busses that we took had an unexpected stop to pick-up some cargo along the way. There was food from restaurants, living fish, metal rods, and a huge aquarium among some of what we have seen.

Booking transport through excursions or homestays worked best. They handle connections and usually arrange hotel pickup and drop-off, which is easier and less stressful. Sometimes they also know about local buses not aimed at tourists, which can be the only viable connection, as we learned when traveling from Mo Cay to Ho Chi Minh City.

Driving style is hectic across all bus types, with hard acceleration, sudden braking, aggressive overtaking, and fast cornering. The roads are not the greatest either. This makes long journeys unpleasant. We wished trains reached more of the places we wanted to visit.

Ride-hailing was unreliable when traveling from rural areas into towns. For example, we waited 30 minutes for a ride from Ta Van to Sapa, though we had no issues going in the opposite direction.

**Thailand**

**North Thailand: Chiang Mai 24–27 Nov, Chiang Dao 28–29 Nov, Chiang Rai 30 Nov–3 Dec (small slow boat from Laos border)**

**Hiking**

We were excited about hiking and natural scenery but ended up disappointed. Entrance fees for foreigners are often five times higher than for locals, which is frustrating but understandable. More problematic were the additional requirements: special permits, designated transport to trailheads, or mandatory guides, even for easy hikes on wooden paths. This was not the nature experience that we wanted to have so ended up skipping many of the national parks. One place that we liked was Doi ang khang—it was free and you could hike on your own.

**Prices**

Pricing felt inconsistent. Freshly prepared street food cost around 60 baht, roughly half the price of a chocolate bar in a supermarket. An iced coffee was around 80 baht, while a cocktail in a reputable place cost about 300 baht, the same as a full hour-long massage. Cosmetics were disproportionately expensive, often matching or exceeding US prices. There were some differences on specific products between the SEA countries (for example depending on import tax rates for wine) but the surprises in the relationship of prices was true for all of the countries.

**Driving**

Driving was straightforward—this was the only place where we had a car. Traffic is left-sided, and somewhat less hectic than Vietnam or Laos. Roads were decent, too.

**Restaurants**

Besides China, we had the most interesting food. It was worth venturing beyond tourist hotspots to try dishes other than pad Thai. The general low spiciness level was a surprise. Vegetarian options were reasonably easy to find, and alternative milks such as soy and oat were widely available, even in small coffee shops. That was a nice change from Vietnam.

 

**North Laos**

**Luang Prabang 4–8 Dec, Nong Khiaw 9–12 Dec (flight from Luang Prabang to Cambodia)**

**General**

Laos felt like a mix of Thailand and Vietnam, but with less intensity. I see why some people recommend skipping it. We are glad we didn’t—it was enjoyable for us. The highlight was the slow boat on the Mekong from the Thai border.

**Roads and transport**

We traveled from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw by minivan. It was extremely bumpy, very slow, and uncomfortable. This single experience explained why most tourists now take the train to Vientiane. Even short distances felt draining due to road quality.

**Air pollution**

Because of lighter traffic, Nong Khiaw had noticeably cleaner air.

**Food**

Curries were more common than in Vietnam, but otherwise menus were very similar everywhere, with little regional variation.

 

**Cambodia**

**Siem Reap 13–20 Dec, Phnom Penh 21–22 Dec, Kampot 23–25 Dec (bus via land border to South Vietnam)**

**Transport**

We had only three legs. A flight from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh involved a long Phnom Penh has a very cheap airport bus (1 USD). You have to walk through the parking lot to reach it, but it is faster than tuk-tuks and has few stops.

The bus from Phnom Penh to Kampot was easy, as was Kampot to Can Tho. We were surprised by how good the roads were overall.

In Siem Reap and Kampot we rented scooters for day trips. It was super easy and gave us the independence that we like.

Drivers rarely honked. They flashed lights instead, which made traffic feel calmer than in Vietnam or Laos.

**Payments**

Cards were accepted more often than in Vietnam or Laos, but cash was still useful for small purchases.

**Angkor**

Angkor is worth spending more time there if you can. Some temples are one-and-done. Others can give you a different experience if you pay multiple visits at different times of day. We revisited Ta Prohm just before closing and were completely alone. The atmosphere, animal sounds, and cicadas made it one of the most memorable moments of the trip.

**Vendors and people**

We stayed away from hot spots with stalls but Cambodia and Vietnam had more persistent vendors, asking you to look or come in.

Interestingly, people didn’t feel as warm. We had a couple of unkind encounters (things like you sit at a table while waiting for food. Once you get it a next-stall vendor with drinks tells you that you need to buy something from her because it is her table. We ask the food vendor where can we sit, she gives us a shrug, and actively ignores us).

There was also a lot of grudge against the neighbor countries. We have heard from multiple people (driver, guide, etc) unprompted negative comments about Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese. There is understandable trauma but a lot of negativity nonetheless.

**Climate**

That was the first southern region that we visited and it hit us hard. I can’t imagine the humidity and the heat outside of the “cold” season. I was actually out for a couple of days due to heat exhaustion (which I didn’t expect to hit me because it wasn’t that bad and we were avoiding sun anyway.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits, which btw is probably the best book on behavior change I've read. The idea isn't just ""make it small"" but make it so stupidly easy that you can't say no even on your worst day.

Want to exercise? Your habit isn't ""go to the gym for an hour."" It's ""put on workout clothes."" That's it. Most days you'll keep going once you start, but on brutal days, just putting on the clothes counts as a win. This builds identity (""I'm someone who shows up"") without the pressure of performance.

The book breaks down the psychology behind why small changes compound into massive results over time. Clear spent years researching this stuff and it shows. The framework he provides (make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying) is insanely practical. This book will make you question everything you think you know about willpower and discipline.

Stack Your Habits Like Legos

Habit stacking is stupid simple but works. You attach a new habit to something you already do automatically. The key is being weirdly specific.

Not ""I'll meditate in the morning"" but ""After I pour my coffee, I'll sit on the couch for 2 minutes with my eyes closed.""

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford showed that context matters more than motivation. His book Tiny Habits goes deep on this. He's the guy who basically invented behavior design as a field. The book teaches you how to wire habits into your existing routine so they become automatic. What I love is how he emphasizes celebrating tiny wins, which sounds cheesy but actually rewires your brain to crave the behavior.

Use an App That Doesn't Annoy You

Most habit trackers are overwhelming. I tried like 10 before finding ones that actually helped.

Finch is weirdly effective because it gamifies self care without being preachy. You take care of a little bird by doing your habits. Sounds dumb, works surprisingly well. The app doesn't guilt trip you when you miss days, it just gently nudges you back. It also has mental health check ins and breathing exercises built in, which helps when stress is destroying your routine.

For something more straightforward, Habitica turns your habits into an RPG game. You level up by completing tasks, lose health when you skip them. The social accountability features are solid too if you want friends keeping you honest.

If you want something that pulls from all these habit books and actually structures learning around your specific goals, there's BeFreed. It's an AI learning app that transforms books, research papers, and expert insights into personalized audio podcasts tailored to whatever you're trying to build, like ""stick to habits as someone with ADHD"" or ""build exercise routines that survive burnout."" You can customize the depth from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples, and pick voices that keep you engaged (some people swear by the sarcastic narrator). 

It also generates adaptive learning plans based on your unique struggles, so instead of generic advice, you get a structured path that evolves with you. The virtual coach Freedia lets you pause mid-episode to ask questions or get clarifications, which is clutch when you need specific strategies for your situation. Makes it easier to internalize habit science without needing to read five books back to back.

The Stress-Proof System: Have a Floor, Not Just a Ceiling

This changed my entire approach. Traditional goal setting is ""I'll work out 5 days a week."" Cool, what happens when you get sick or work explodes?

Instead, set three levels:

Floor: The bare minimum that counts (2 minutes of movement)

Target: What you aim for on normal days (30 min workout)

Ceiling: Your best case scenario (60 min workout)

This comes from resilience research. When life gets chaotic, you don't abandon the habit entirely, you just drop to the floor level. The habit survives because you're not operating in black and white thinking.

Your Environment is Sabotaging You

Stanford professor BJ Fogg's research found that environment design beats motivation every time. If you want to read more, put a book on your pillow. If you want to drink water, put bottles everywhere. If you want to stop scrolling, delete social apps from your phone.

Make good behaviors ridiculously easy and bad behaviors slightly annoying. That friction matters more than you think.

Also, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg explains the neuroscience behind why this works. He breaks down the habit loop (cue, routine, reward) and shows how to interrupt bad patterns. The book is full of wild case studies from companies and individuals who completely transformed by understanding these mechanics. Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist so the storytelling is engaging as hell.

The Podcast That Explains Why You Keep Failing

Huberman Lab has incredible episodes on habit formation and dopamine. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and he explains the actual biology of why motivation fades and how to work with your brain instead of against it. His episode on dopamine scheduling legitimately changed how I approach rewards and goals.

When Everything Falls Apart (And It Will)

You're going to have weeks where nothing sticks. That's not failure, that's being human. The difference between people who build lasting habits and people who don't isn't perfection, it's getting back on track quickly.

Research shows that missing once doesn't hurt you. Missing twice starts a pattern. So the rule is simple: never miss twice. One day off is rest. Two days is the beginning of quitting.

Also, stop punishing yourself. Guilt and shame make you less likely to restart, not more. Just acknowledge what happened and do the next right thing.

The Identity Shift

Here's the real secret nobody talks about: habits stick when they become part of who you are, not just what you do.

Instead of ""I want to run,"" think ""I'm a runner."" Instead of ""I should eat healthy,"" think ""I'm someone who takes care of their body."" This identity-based approach (also from Atomic Habits) makes decisions automatic because you're just acting consistent with who you are.

Every small action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. Even on lazy days, even during stress, you can cast one vote. That's enough.

The habits that survive aren't built on motivation or discipline. They're built on systems that account for your humanity, your bad days, your chaos. Design for reality, not for the person you wish you were.",1,1768607525.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False

They're not hipster but they are tasty: 

1 -  Classic-Tropical Foods Ltd, Maryhill Rd:
Nigerian bakery that sells traditional baked goods at ridiculously cheap prices (a bun/puff puff etc is like 35p?!)
E.g: 
- Meat pies (like pasties but with a thicker, heavier pastry) 
Buns (Wee crispy coated sweet dough balls that are light and moreish and my absolute favourite) 
- Puff Puff (like a mini doughnut but without the sugar coating) 
- Akara (a type of light, mildly spicy bean cake you sometimes eat with bread) and more.  
The owners are really lovely too, and they sell some Nigerian malt drinks and bread, as well.

2 - Arabean Cafe, Woodlands Rd: 
Really cute Arabic cafe (with excellent wallpaper!) serving dishes like muqalqal - a traditional Yemeni lamb dish, ful, yummy kunafeh, éclairs and cheap and delicious coffee and fresh mint tea.  The mains come with hot, freshly made flatbread and salad for free, and it's a steal, honestly.  The owner is v. sweet, too.

3 - Maska - Indian Vegetarian Cafe (inside the Raunak Raseeli restaurant during the day), Clarendon Rd:
Delicious and authentic Indian street food like Chole Bhature (tangy chickpea curry with a puffed up fried bread) and Pav Bhaji (sort of like a tasty curry gravy in a morning roll) for affordable prices in a nice cafe setting.  Their halwa is really delicious, too.

4 - Kothu Rotti, just off North Woodside Rd:
A tiny Sri Lankan outdoor cafe (thankfully with a roof when it's pelting it) with room for a few tables that serves gorgeous curries, mutton rolls, chai and all manner of other Sri Lankan delicacies plus Scottish breakfasts, too.  I really enjoyed the prawn curry and utthappam onion dosa (sort of like a fermented rice savoury crepe with onions and coriander). Friendly chefs, too!

1qewf24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qewf24/this_one_study_will_change_how_you_think_about/,This One Study Will Change How You Think About Your Entire Life,"Ever catch yourself wondering, “Am I even building a life I’ll enjoy 10, 20, or 30 years from now?” Most people don’t ask that. We chase status, money, and validation but forget to ask what actually makes life \*worth\* living long-term. The truth? Most of us are chasing the wrong scoreboard.

There’s one study that shook the psychology world, and it’s still going. The [Harvard Study of Adult Development](https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/) followed people for over 85 years. The biggest finding? It’s not wealth, fame, or even career success that predicts the happiest and healthiest lives. It’s the \*quality of your relationships\*. Not quantity. Not clout. Relationships.

Dr. Robert Waldinger, the current director, gave a TED Talk on it. He said, plain and simple, “Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.” People who were more socially connected lived longer, got sick less often, and felt more fulfilled. Those who were lonely died earlier. This isn’t pop wisdom. It’s data across decades.

So what does that actually mean for today?

Here’s what the best sources say about building a life that doesn’t feel empty at the top:

1. Invest in real friendships like your life depends on it.\*\* Because it kind of does. Johan Hari’s \*Lost Connections\* shows that loneliness increases your risk of depression more than genetics and even trauma. Make time for people who make your nervous system feel safe. Weekly calls, coffee chats, random memes small things build deep bonds. Social media doesn’t count.

2. \*\*Focus on meaning over metrics.\*\* Psychologist Martin Seligman’s work on “PERMA” in [positive psychology](https://positivepsychology.com/perma-model/) shows that lasting fulfillment comes more from meaning and engagement than just pleasure or achievement. Find stuff that puts you in deep focus. Help others. Do things that feel aligned with your core values, not just your resume.

3. \*\*Stop chasing happiness; build psychological richness.\*\* A 2021 study by Shige Oishi introduced this concept. Psychological richness means seeking \*variety, complexity, and perspective shifts\*—doing things that challenge your worldview and make your life feel interesting. Taking risks, traveling somewhere new, and learning a new skill you suck at—those moments make life feel \*alive\*, not just pleasant.

4. \*\*Your brain needs novelty and connection like it needs food and sleep.\*\* Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this a lot on the \*Huberman Lab\* podcast. Daily routines are great, but your brain thrives when you add small bits of novelty and reward. Mix in curiosity with connection and you get dopamine and oxytocin, aka the neurochemical glow of “life’s good.”

So yeah, your job, income, and follower count—all of that matters way less than we think. What you’ll remember are the people, the challenges, and the conversations that shook you a little. That’s what builds a full, interesting life. Not just a productive one.",1,1768607133.0,MindDecoding,1,1.0,False
1qewbmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1qewbmw/somewhere_in_nowhere_the_spider_princess/,Somewhere in Nowhere - The Spider Princess,"Hey, everyone. I’m sure you were expecting Newport, but no. This is Dawson. He gave me access to his Reddit account as long as I promised not to defame him in front of the whole internet. I said I’d do my best (a lie.)

I don’t know if I’ve got the same storytelling power that he does, but regardless, I’m going to tell you guys about the spider princess. But my side of the story… goes a bit deeper than that whole mess, I guess. I made Newport promise not to read this until I told him it was okay, but honestly, I may never let him. I have my reasons. 

It all started in the first few days of September, right before the corn harvest. 

It didn’t feel like it was going to be a day different from any of the others when I woke up. Sure, it would be a little different, considering I was heading over to see my best friend, and a few months ago, I hadn’t had one of those, besides my mom. But going over to Newport’s was quickly becoming a new normal.

When my alarm went off, I hit snooze and rolled over, resting my eyes for just a little longer. Even when you’re an early riser like me, there’s just something about those five extra minutes. 

The smell of breakfast cooking filled my nose and got me opening my eyes again. After crawling out of my three-quilt cocoon and throwing on my running clothes, I headed downstairs. Hollyhock, looking extra moppy today, rose from her place at the foot of my bed and plodded along after me. She’s one of three of my dogs, and I’ve had her since she could fit in my hand.

“Shíyázhí. How did you sleep?”

I stole a piece of bacon from the pile my mom was pulling from a pan, and burned my mouth for my troubles. Even at 6 AM and with no coffee yet, she looked ready for the day. Her hair was tied back and she was wearing her favorite dress, the one she’d bought the last time we took a trip back to the Rez.

“Good. No weird dreams,” I lied. “How did *you* sleep?”

“Like a baby bird in a basket.”

My mom wrapped up a breakfast burrito for me, packing it in a paper bag along with an apple.

“You haven’t seen anything strange lately, have you? You know what I’ve told you, son.”

I definitely had, but not the kind of thing my mom was watching out for.

“Not much more than weird spots of color. My brain has been behaving.”

For context, sometimes I hallucinate. I don’t like to talk about the “why” much, because it inevitably leads to “I’m so sorry that happened to you.” It’s nice and all, but it gets old fast, especially considering I barely remember it. When I was four, my mom took me to the doctor because I suddenly couldn’t see, and the doctors found a brain tumor, I got it surgically removed, and my vision returned. Since I was so young, my brain had ample time to recover, but we’re all pretty sure it didn’t grow back entirely right. My mom, however, thought it was always in me. That it was my birthright— something to be proud of and to pay attention to. 

The hallucinations can be anything from a few colorful butterflies in the distance to a shadowy monster standing behind a loved one, savagely chewing on their shoulder. I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut, and thankfully, I can usually tell what’s real and what’s not. Or that’s how it used to be, at least. 

I grabbed a water bottle and threw on my running shoes. 

“Be careful. The ground is still wet from the rain.”

I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and she smiled. 

“Don’t worry. I’m always careful.”

She rolled her eyes and waved me off, reminding me to try and make it home for dinner. I promised I would.

I pulled my jacket a little closer around myself as I walked down to the main road. It was one of those unusually chilly fall mornings for this part of the South. I thought about turning around and going back inside until the sun had its chance to warm the world. But no, Newport was probably waiting on me.

I stretched out my legs a little before starting a pretty impressive sprint, if I do say so myself. The sun hid behind thick grey clouds as it rose, leaving my path gray and misted. I’d just blown past Silver’s Curve when I couldn’t ignore the burn in my throat any longer. I jogged to a stop and opened the bottle from the bag my mom gave me. After chugging half of it, the fresh smell of the apple wafted from within, and my stomach growled. We’d picked the latest batch the week before, and our apples seemed to get prettier every year. 

I took a big bite, savoring the taste and the sound of the crisp skin snapping… except the second one never came. Confused, I took another bite, and was met with silence. I could hear the wind singing along with the birds as it whipped through the trees, and I could hear the rattle of an old wooden gate somewhere in the near distance. I could even hear my own pulse as it thumped faster and faster in my ears. But what I couldn’t hear was the apple. I stood there and ate the entire thing with not so much as a single smack. 

Something was wrong.

I uneasily tossed the core to the side of the road, and as soon as it hit the ground, the chattering began. I jumped back, startled, and struck with the crazy thought that it was coming from the apple core. It was hard and sharp, but organic, like fingernails. It almost sounded like a word.

“Newport’s going to get a kick out of this one,” I mumbled to myself, “everyone knows oranges are the only fruit that talk.”

As if provoked by my stupid joke, the apple core began to roll in the opposite direction, spinning through the ditch and hurtling into the woods. 

I knew I shouldn’t follow it. In fact, it would’ve been a much wiser decision to strip off all my clothes and skip down the road singing showtunes. It was probably just a hallucination, which made me just about as nervous as grand prix produce. I hadn’t had any in a while, and I was just beginning to think it might stay that way. 

I knew I shouldn’t follow it, but by the time I’d fully processed that thought, I was already breaking the treeline. The clicking got louder as I walked deeper into the pines, and it wasn’t long before I stumbled upon the small hollow. The grass was dry and dead, and the trees surrounding it were already bare despite it barely being autumn. Well, all except for the one in the middle. 

The branches were full of green leaves that shook in the wind as it picked up. That, and apples. Each branch hung low and strained with the weight of the massive amount of fruit. It would’ve been a really pretty sight if it weren’t for the fact that every single one had a full set of yellowed teeth in a cavernous mouth, each clicking them together in an animalistic frenzy. 

“What the…”

My legs went weak and sore beneath me and I suddenly really regretted my run that morning. I took a step back, but the clicking just got louder. Almost like they were telling me to stay. 

But no, that’s not what they were saying at all. I could hear it, a single word chanted by dozens of nightmare apples. *Ripe. Ripe. Ripe.*

I watched one apple sink its teeth into the skin of another, foul juice running in rivers to the ground. This time, the sound of breaking skin was loud and clear. I turned and ran as fast as I could out of those woods, the tart, sweet taste of fruit mixed with stomach acid on the back of my tongue.

I ran all the way to Newport’s house, not stopping for even a breath until I was crashing through his front door. I doubled over and almost puked on his feet. He was still in a nightgown, Alice in one hand, and a frozen waffle in the other. 

Alice, if you didn’t know, is his twelve-gauge shotgun, named by yours truly. I think it suits her. The stock was two weak pieces of plywood Newport had stuck to it, after it broke when we were fighting the Rot. It wasn’t anything that would hold together more than once, but something told me that, for whatever reason Newport *really* had that gun, once would be all he needed. 

“What’re you running from this time? The circus you escaped from finally catch up with you?”

I would have laughed if I had enough air in my lungs to do it. I grabbed the edge of the table and looked down, the world spinning around me a little. I would have liked to say I’m just out of shape, but we both know I’d be lying. It was definitely the fear, and I couldn’t understand why it had bothered me so bad when I was used to things like this. 

“Teeth,” was all I said, all I could say. Newport’s light mood dissolved and he grabbed my shoulders. As he stared into my eyes, my heart rate slowed, and I could feel myself coming back down.

“Show me.”

He didn’t question or doubt me for a second. He just scarfed his waffle, threw on his boots, and pulled me out into the building rain. We walked all the way back to where I’d found the horticultural horror, and Newport looked at me warily. The air was still filled with the clacking sounds of teeth on teeth. 

“This is probably gonna ruin whatever appetite you had for breakfast, so… sorry in advance.”

Newport barked out a laugh, his crooked teeth curling into a wry grin. 

”At least I won’t be eating on *purpose* this time.”

Then he took my hand, and we trudged through the growing mud, into the forest. The closer we got, the more the sound changed. When we made it to the hollow, it was entirely different, sharp teeth slicing into fruit flesh. 

Newport stuck his arm out in front of me, stopping before either of us took another step closer to Hairy. The bearsquatch was down on his hands and knees, feasting on a scattered pile of apples. They were normal, not a single grin to be seen. Juice dripped down his fleshy snout and glistened in the wrinkles of his pink skin. 

“Is Hairy what spooked you so bad?”

It was a genuine question, not a dismissal. But still, I lied. It’s not that I thought he wouldn’t believe me. I just didn’t want it to be real, or even worse, not be real. I didn’t want to tell Newport about my brain stuff. With all we’d been through, I didn’t want him to think he couldn’t rely on me.

“I… I guess so, yeah. He’s a sneaky bastard. Wanted the Tree of Knowledge all to himself.” 

Hairy looked up at us and growled like a starved dog, baring an enormous set of canines. It was loud and guttural, the kind of sound that would’ve made most people shit their pants and run home to their mom. But Newport stared him down like he was an annoying toddler. 

“Oh shut up, you Build-A-Missing-Link.”

Newport patted me on the back and turned toward the road.

“Don’t beat yourself up about it. Hairy has scared me more than a few times.”

I followed after him, trying my best not to feel like I was losing it. Then he stopped abruptly.

 ”What’s this?”

In the crow behavior that was very typical of him, Newport picked up the small and slightly shiny things that had caught his eye. Something uncomfortable grew in the pit of my stomach as I saw what it was— a nauseating mix of relief and dread. It was three teeth, yellowed and cracked, still attached to a thin strip of bloody gum. He immediately dropped it. 

“Wow, that was. Yeah. That was gross. Those teeth you were talking about?” 

I tried to answer, but only managed a nervous whine. Newport stared at me for a long moment, then nodded, as if he was deciding something.

“Let’s get out of here. The rain is getting worse, and I’m sick of smelling bear butt.”

I didn’t argue. I just let him take my hand again and lead us back to the farm. By the time we made it back, we were both soaked to the bone by a chilly September downpour. 

As soon as we got under the porch awning, Newport turned to me.

“Alright, we’re home and you’re safe with me now. So out with it. What did you see? Because you clearly saw something.”

“It was nothing, really. It was probably just nothing.”

Newport put his free hand on his hip. 

“And I’m probably gonna hit you upside the head.” To drive home his point, he put Alice over his shoulder like a major league batter.

“Make sure to do it extra hard. It might fix a thing or two,” I said, before really thinking about it. Curse my hilarity!

Newport paused, then set the gun down against the house. 

“Dawson, you know you can tell me anything, right? I know I don’t really talk about my stuff a lot, and I think if I tried to call myself anything close to a therapist, I’d be struck by lightning. But I’m always gonna listen.”

I didn’t say anything for a second; I just looked at him. He watched me with those big green eyes, his hair hanging in his face and rain clinging to his stubble. His nightgown shifted in the wind, mud stained along the hem and caked on his boots. 

As I looked at him, I realized I wasn’t stopping. I could just keep looking at him forever and never get tired of it. I wanted to. 

“You okay? You’re staring at me.”

I snapped back to reality and crossed my arms, grinning at him.

“Don’t think there’s any rules against looking at people, Newp.”

He rolled those green eyes at me, but he was smiling. Then his smile fell.

“Seriously, Dawson.”

I sighed.

“Alright, fine. I saw… well, you’re gonna think I’m crazy—“

“Remember who you’re talking to.”

“— but it was. A bunch of apples with mouths. It was really freaky. But it probably wasn’t even real because I just see stuff like that. I have for as long as I can really remember. My mom thinks it’s the Gift— that I should always pay attention. The doctors said it's the result of complex brain surgery on a four year old.” 

I braced myself for the pity party, but I think he lost the invite. Instead, he just shrugged.

“Doesn’t really matter if it was real or not. It freaked you out. Also, those teeth didn’t come from nowhere… unless Hairy’s gotten into the habit of eating people. I hope not, but I’m not going to lie and say this town couldn’t stand to lose a certain person or two.”

I knew exactly who he was talking about, but where’s the fun in spoiling that one?

“Furthermore, you and I both have seen a triple-decker crazy sandwich twice before breakfast. I get the feeling you think it makes a difference to me whether whatever you’re seeing is real or not. But it doesn’t. You’re my best friend, warts and all.”

He grabbed Alice again, and took a knee on the porch. I stood beside him, a weird feeling tingling in my stomach.

“Th… thank you,” I croaked out, my throat suddenly tight. He looked up at me, one eyebrow raised, half a scoff leaving his chapped lips.

“What? Don’t thank me, you weirdo. Just go inside and get out the flour and eggs. I got a late start on the walk today, and you were absolutely wrong about me losing my appetite.”

I gave him a mock-salute and went inside, gathering the necessary ingredients for pancakes. As much as I loved baking from scratch, I was more of a cupcakes in the afternoon kind of guy, and I was buying Newport a gallon of premade batter as soon as my mom and I made another trip to town. 

I actually didn’t jump this time when there was suddenly an old woman standing next to me. I was getting better at not letting her startle me. Aunt Jean was in a harvest orange dress, complete with the buckled pilgrim shoes. 

“Morning, Aunt Jean. How’s old age treating you today?”

She smiled at me like she knew a secret I didn’t, then, and I swear on my life, even if Newport doesn’t believe me, she did an honest-to-god backflip right there in the kitchen. I’m pretty sure I heard every single bone in her body crack.

“Well, I guess that answers that. Do you want this?”

I’d only just realized that I was still holding the paper bag with the burrito my mom had given me in it. The top was a little shredded, but it still had the goods. I offered it out to Aunt Jean, and when I blinked, the entire thing was gone. A strip of brown paper clung to her lips, and she pulled it off delicately with her pink-painted nails.

“Andddd that answers that too. I’m gonna start on pancakes, if you’ve still got room after that.”

Aunt Jean said nothing, as usual, but instead hopped up on the counter and sat as I began to cook, swinging her wrinkly legs like a teenage girl. 

Newport came in after taking care of his morning activities, and once the batter was mixed, he decided it would be funny to throw flour in my face. Naturally, this turned into an all out flour war. When it was over, and I was victorious, Newport reluctantly bestowed upon me the glorious prize of using his shower. We were both still soaked from the rain, and flour was starting to clump in my soggy hair. I kept a change of clothes over here anyway as a precaution for the various messes that happen on a farm, especially this one. Also because more and more often, I was falling asleep at the farmhouse.

“You totally used my shampoo.”

Newport came up behind me after his turn with the shower and snatched a pancake from the pan, still searing hot. I turned around and watched him toss it back and forth in between his hands for a good minute before tearing off half of it like a starved lion. One of these days, he was gonna end up in a zoo.

“You think I grew out my hair like this just to ruin it with flour goo? Do the ancestors mean nothing to you?”

“My dad had a mullet for the first seven years of my life. Does that answer your question?”

I poured in more batter and winced.

“Whew, yeah, that one. That one’s rough. My condolences. Your shampoo smells really nice, though. Coconut?”

He nodded. I piled our plates high with blueberry pancakes, making sure there was one for Aunt Jean, even though she’d already eaten. It was good to see Newport digging in as soon as he sat down, because most of the time, I had to remind him to eat. For a little while, there was only the sound of both of us ugly eating and noises of content. It had been that kind of morning.

I think Newport was the first to see it. His mouth slowed as his eyes followed something across the table. At first glance, it looked like a blueberry rolling through the thin sheen of flour left on the table top. I thought to myself how tired I was of moving fruit, and that we’d definitely reached that quota today. But as I looked closer, I realized it had eight legs and a tiny head on which there was… an even tinier crown?

“I think Two-Toothed Steve might’ve lost another painting project. I’ve never seen a blue corn spider.”

We watched it for a while with benign curiosity, finishing our pancakes. It made a very dedicated if random path, crawling slowly through the flour. Newport suddenly froze, fork hovering over his mouth. 

“What? What is it?”

But then I realized. The tiny trail the spider had made through the flour wasn’t random at all. It spelled out a word, in letters big enough for a castaway: HELP ME. 

“You didn’t learn how to spell in the last five minutes, did you?”

Newport sat his fork down.

“Are you kidding me? You think I wouldn’t have been bragging about it nonstop to you if that was the case?”

The spider got as far into its next word as *PLEA*, and then Newport jumped up from the table.

“I have an idea! Be right back.”

He ran up the stairs, and not one to waste food even at the worst of times, I finished my pancakes. I was washing up the dishes and listening to Newport rummage around in his room upstairs when I heard the little footsteps. At first, I assumed it was Osseola, until I realized I was not at my own house and it was definitely not my cat. I looked over and in the hall doorway was the biggest spider I’ve ever seen. And I’m not saying that like I saw a tarantula for the first time because one, I've seen one before, and two, this spider was as big as a Jack Russell Terrier. 

It was a corn spider just like the tiny one, only its pattern was interspersed with pink instead of blue. I had to push down the whispers of the arachnophobia I’d had as a kid. Newport, however, screamed like a little girl when he came back downstairs. 

“Dude, calm down. If it had wanted to eat us, it would’ve finished me off and come for you by now. It’s just been sitting there watching me.”

“Yeah, that totally makes me feel better and not like it’s plotting the best way to catch us off guard and slurp us like smoothies.”

I sat back down at the table, back turned to the giant spider. I couldn’t explain it, but even though it startled me, I didn’t feel any malice coming from it.

“They eat bugs, Newp. We’re probably not even on his radar. He’s probably out there taking out entire hornet nests for you.”

Newport sighed and agreed that I had a good point. Then, almost to further prove that I was the one with the brain cell today, he pulled out a freaking ouija board. It wasn’t the classic Hasbro one either. No, it was a dinky little cardboard thing with Sharpie letters.

“Made this with my family one Halloween. My dad thought it was a bad idea but my mom was on an occult kick. My… we played with it for a while but it was mostly a dud. We couldn’t figure out who Zuzu was.”

Wow. That made a lot more things make a lot more sense.

“This’ll be easier than running around trying to make messages in flour.”

“I can’t argue with you there, but someone will have to—”

Newport put a Lisa Frank notebook and a pen in my hand.

“And you will be our faithful scribe, right?”

I rolled my eyes and I watched the spider dutifully make its way to the DIYja board.

“Why don’t you buy me dinner first?”

Newport cracked a grin wide enough to see from the edge of his face, and without turning, said “it’s a date.” I knew it was just an expression, but I was really glad he couldn’t see my face.

For all the messages I’d imagined of world domination or *bring food now* from our tiny spider houseguest, what it spelled out first surprised me.

*M-Y-N-A-M-E-I-S-N-E-L-L-I-E.* 

The spider had introduced herself to us, and she had a pretty human name. Newport looked back at me, confused and fascinated. I almost missed her second message when I was looking into his curious eyes for just a little too long. Good thing I mastered those typing games in elementary school.

*PRINCESS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE CORN.*

Newport laughed incredulously. 

“Guess we’re in the presence of royalty. Is that big fella over there your prince?”

The tiny spider princess paused long enough that we thought she was done. But then she began to skitter across the cardboard again. 

*He is my companion. His name does not translate.*

I looked at the dog-sized spider that was making his way slowly into the room, then back at the princess.

“Well, I want to call him something. How about Wilbur?”

*He does not look like a Wilbur, but I will accept this.*

Newport nervously offered the giant spider a chunk of pancake that somehow escaped our plates, and he took it eagerly.

“Well, no offense, but all you spiders kind of look the same. Besides the size thing.”

Newport nudged me hard in the side.

“Dude, what the fuck, don’t be insensitive!”

“They’re spiders!”

Princess Nellie crawled across the board faster than she ever had.

*You really upset me and I’m going to need you to apologize right now.*

“C’mon man. Apologize to the lady.”

I ran a hand through my hair and crouched down, eye level with Princess Nellie.

“Fine, fine. You’re right, that was kind of messed up of me to say. I’m sorry.”

She nodded her little head in righteous, spidery indignation. Then she began to crawl again, answering the million dollar question before we could ask it.

*I need your help. My stupid mom won’t die.* 

Newport and I looked at each other, then back at Princess Nellie.

“Wanna run that by me again?”

Princess Nellie proceeded to give us a lesson in corn spider society. Apparently, the spiders have a queen, who rules over them for a period not to exceed sixty-one years. When that time comes, she has a daughter, who then becomes the queen, and afterwards, the preceding spider queen dies. Nellie was that daughter, but for some reason, her mother wasn’t giving up the throne that rightfully belonged to her. Not only that, but some of her spidery subjects were behind her mother keeping the throne. 

Newport scanned over what I’d written down, then rubbed his forehead.

“Man. That’s a lot of drama for someone the size of a dime to be dealing with.” 

He was right. I couldn’t even stage a coup d’etat on the TV remote when my dad was watching Impractical Jokers— I couldn’t imagine having to overthrow my own mom.

*Yes. That’s why I need your help to kill her.* 

My stomach turned a little. I felt guilty when I swatted at mosquitoes. The only reason I’d had no problem burning up the Rot was because it had tried its hardest to kill Newport. But killing a spider just because she wasn’t following the rules made me feel weird.

*The Elders prophesied that I would find help from the Dirty Giant who lives in the Castle Beyond the Corn.*

Newport giggled at the nickname, and I found it funny how he didn’t even have to question that she was referring to him.

“Of course we’ll help.” 

I raised an eyebrow.

“What? I never agreed to play hitman.”

Newport narrowed his eyes at me, then glanced at Nellie. 

“Can I speak to my associate for one second?” He said in his best customer service voice, before pulling me through the doorway into the living room. 

”Come on, Newport. We don’t even know if this spider queen is actually evil or anything. Maybe she’s toppling a ruling standard that should've long since come down!”

Newport crossed his arms over his chest and sighed. 

“Alright, I won’t deny that’s a good point. But if we don’t agree to help her, we’ll never know. If the princess is the problem, we can double agent this shit. When’s the last time we had a good, low stakes quest?”

I wasn’t sure how low the stakes actually were, but regardless, Newport was making sense, even if I hated to admit it.

“We have enough problems of our own right now, Newp. What about the freaky thing I saw in the woods?!”

He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled at me. I felt my stomach twist, but not in a bad way. It was the first drop of a roller coaster. 

“I haven’t forgotten about the haunted dentist apples. We’ll figure it all out. We make a pretty good team when it comes down to it. We can handle both, don’t you think?”

I looked away from his expectant face and tried to find a way through his solid logic. We did make a good team, and it wasn’t every day you were part of a prophecy. None of it really mattered though, because he wanted to help, and I wanted to do what was going to make him happy.

“Listen,” he said with a soft sigh, “if you really don’t want to, I’ll tell her we have something we can’t get out of this weekend. We’re either both on board or neither of us. What you need is more important to me than a spider revolution, dude.”

I turned back to him and he was giving me an earnest smile and god, I just couldn’t say no to him. I didn’t want to.

“Alright, you convinced me. But if things get too weird, we’re bailing out.“

Newport nodded with a grin that said *not a chance.*

“Good. Because I’m the dirty giant from the spider prophecy and I make the rules.”

He practically skipped back into the kitchen to tell Princess Nellie that we’d help her. After a minute, I followed him.

*I offer you my highest gratitude, Dirty Giant and Dirty Giant’s Friend! I will speak to the Elders and return to you post haste.*

Newport gave the princess a two finger salute and escorted her and Wilbur out the front door. After that, it was business as usual. 

When the sun hung in orange just above the trees and the heat wasn’t as slap-you-in-the-face, Newport peeled himself off the couch and away from the random Internet videos we’d been watching. 

“Wanna take a ride on my big green tractor?”

I jumped up and tied my hair back. 

“Is the big green tractor in the room with us? Because I bet your bucket of bolts hasn’t been anything but cowpie brown since the nineties.”

Newport just scoffed and dragged me out to the back of the barn with him. The truth was, though I’d only done it one other time, riding along on the harvest was one of my favorite things in the world. I held onto his shoulders, carefully crouched as we plodded along. Every breath was full of good smells— homemade smoke, turned dirt, drying leaves, coconut —and the clouds had dissipated, leaving the sky the bluest I’d ever seen.

Newport saved the field closest to the house for another day, not wanting to disturb the corn spiders before they got the chance to have their revolt. Instead, we packed it in after all of the others had been picked clean, Newport luring me in with the promise of mindless television and cube steak. 

I texted my mom that I’d be home in an hour, but by the fourth episode of How It’s Made, I’d dozed off.  

The first thing I saw when I woke up was the moon.  It was big and round in the window, and I got a disorienting sense of deja vu. It looked like a massive eye, staring in at me. Judging me. Watching me struggle. 

*Fuck. My mom*.

I got up from the couch, where Newport had fallen asleep beside me, in the kind of position that would’ve had a pretzel taking notes. Without really thinking about it, I picked him up and carried him up the stairs to his room. He didn’t wake up, but he mumbled in his sleep, something that sounded suspiciously like “cinnamon rolls.” I decided to get my mom to make him some, if she didn’t skin me first.

Aunt Jean watched me from the kitchen doorway while I grabbed my jacket, and as I opened the door, I heard her call out “good boy” in the same way she’d done when I made Newport take care of his bruise. I didn’t feel like a very good boy right then, but I took the compliment anyway. 

I stood on the porch, and after sending a few panicked apology texts to my mom, I stared out into the darkness and thought about the long walk home. I considered turning and going back inside, but then, someone pressed play on a memory. 

Maybe a week after the Rot disappeared, I was sitting outside with Newport while he milked his cow, Dairy Queen. A particularly nasty fly bite had made her nearly kick me, and though I didn’t hold it against her, I was standing at a good distance.

“You know,” Newport said, “anything that’s actually worth worrying about will try and kick your ass in the daytime too. You’re telling me I’m supposed to be afraid of something that’s afraid of the sun?”

I guessed it had slipped his mind that one of our biggest problems hesitated to show his snout out in the sunlight. But I wasn’t about to remind him of that particular monster.

“I don’t think that’s fully true. I can name *several* things that we wouldn’t have to worry about during the day. Have you ever seen a werewolf out for an afternoon stroll? Or a sunbathing vampire?”

Newport just rolled his eyes.

“Please. I’d tie a werewolf into a knot.”

And maybe I still stood by my statement, but his logic still gave me enough courage to venture out into the dark anyway. I kept my eyes off the porky pair staring at me from a distance and started jogging once I hit the main road. 

The night was alive, full of the wind in the trees and the calls of crickets and frogs. The moon that watched me through the window was just bright enough to illuminate my path. Maybe the trip home wouldn’t be so bad.

Then I hit the trees just past Silver’s Curve, and it was like I’d just jogged into another world. 

Moonlight wasn’t welcome here. The air was still and quiet, and as much as I should’ve turned around and ran back to the farmhouse for the rest of the night, the fear of making my mother sad outweighed any others. Not only that, but I could sense something just a few steps behind me. It was watching me, and if I turned around, I'd have to face it. 

“It’s okay,” I mumbled to myself, “you go this way every day. No way some voyeuristic  monster is gonna beat you home.” 

I kept walking steadily, the darkness thickening and rolling over me like ink, choking the urge to run. Not yet. 

Then came the crunch of a twig behind me, just when I’d passed the post with a stripe of paint I’d left on it, a marker that I was halfway home. I took off. 

All at once, the branches around me began to shake like hurricane season. I heard the hard thud of apples as they pelted the ground, launched from trees that definitely bore no fruit in the daylight. 

I ran harder and faster, even after getting Isaac Newton’d more than once. Once I could see the break in the pines, whatever force working against me got desperate. Roots surfaced from the ground like alligators out of a pond, and I dodged them as best as I could. 

I didn’t realize one had caught me until my chin hit the dirt. It coiled around my ankle and thickened, before yanking me backward. It felt like a rope more than a vine, like someone was pulling on the other end. 

It dragged me a good few feet before I dug my nails hard into the dirt, gritting my teeth. The harder I fought, the harder it pulled. I’m not ashamed to say I yelled out for my mom. The image of her finding me strung up in the branches of a tree gave me the rush of horrified adrenaline I needed to break free. I tore loose with a loud, woody snap*,* and I was back on my feet so fast I almost fell back down. Few times in my life before then had I run faster. 

When I passed the treeline, it felt like someone unpaused the world again. The hoots of owls and croaks of frogs were too loud, and the night around me looked like a saturated scenery puzzle. The presence of whatever had been following me had lifted, and the only monster that I was left to deal with was overstimulation. I kept going.

I slowed down just a little as I made it to the turn-off of my road. Running up the drive, I could see that the porch light had been left on, as well as the light above the stove in the kitchen. Everything was okay now. I’d made it, and my mom was waiting for me despite it all.  

I opened the front door with my key and stepped into the kitchen. The second I laid my foot past the threshold, the air turned to ice. Standing by the sink, holding a ripe apple and my mom’s washing rag was a tall, shadowy figure. My eyes locked with its shining white ones, and it gave me a smile full of gleaming teeth. The air filled with the smell of cider, enough cinnamon to make me feel sick. 

“Get out of my house,” I gasped, stumbling back toward the door, “get out of my house! Leave me alone!”

In the space of a blink, everything changed. The light and warmth came back, and instead of staring into the face of a ghoul, I was caught in my mom’s worried gaze. Her grip on my shoulders was tight and grounding. 

“Dawson, my son, what’s wrong? Where have you been all this time? You’re covered in dirt, and— Heaven help, you’re bleeding too. The fear you put into me. Sit.”

I collapsed into a kitchen chair, and she cradled my head in her arms. 

“I’ve been having bad dreams, Mom. I think something is messing with me.”

I couldn’t tell her the whole truth. The thought of making her any more worried than she already was made my heart ache. But I knew she could sense there was something more. My dad always said I got my smarts honest. 

She shook her head no and kissed my forehead.

“Not while I’m around. It will have to get through me first,” she said, war face and all. 

After cleaning my cuts, she lit her special bundle of white sage from my grandmother. I stood up and let her cleanse me until she was satisfied, then she left the bundle smoldering as she grabbed a plate from the fridge. The microwave hummed to life, and she turned to me. 

“What hurt you, son? You and I both know it wasn’t your dreams.”

I sighed, and answered honestly.

“I don’t know.”

I considered for a second that maybe the Rot was back for round two. But that didn’t feel right. When that thing was around, it had given me a certain feeling in my stomach— spoiled and earthy. What I’d felt running through that corridor of darkness was different; it was sharp and sour. And I almost would’ve preferred it to be the former haunting me. There’s only one thing worse than the devil you know, and I wasn’t sure if Newport could sink his dentures into this one.

She walked across the kitchen and put a hand on my shoulder. There was a warm, familiar look in her eyes. I’d seen it a million times, on birthdays and on Christmas, whenever I’d give her paper flowers on Mother’s Day or skin my knee when I was climbing a tree. I’d long learned the unspoken words in it: *you’re* *my miracle, and as long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you.* 

“It’s alright. You don’t have to.”

She didn’t press any further. I could tell she wanted to ask again if I’d been seeing things, but my mom always knew when to talk and when to listen. Instead, she just sat the warm plate of dinner I’d missed in front of me then took the chair next to me.

“I’m sorry I was late. I’ve been doing that a lot recently and I want you to know that it’s usually not on purpose, and it tears me up inside every time I realize that I—“

“Don’t sit here and apologize to me, Dawson. I’ve hoped and wished every night that you would find someone other than your father and I to spend your time with. I love being your best friend, but I’m so grateful you’ve got someone closer to your age to confide in. You have nothing to be sorry for.” 

I didn’t realize I’d started crying until she wordlessly handed me a tissue.

“I know, but I still should stick to my word and make it back for dinner when I say I am.”

She pushed the plate of food closer to me. It was a bowl of corn stew, and she’d put a toasted bread roll on the side. It smelled heavenly.

“Listen, son. Your dinner is right here, and so am I. Eat it, and all is well.”

I still felt guilty, but I knew I couldn’t argue any further, and it also hadn’t occurred to me until just then how starved I was. So I tucked in. 

“I think it’s sweet that you stay so long over there. I remember when that was me and your father.”

I nearly choked on the mouthful I’d shoved in. 

“Really, when are you going to bring him around? I want to properly meet the boy that makes my son so happy. Not in a hospital room.”

I sat my spoon down and swallowed hard. My food wasn’t sitting well with the butterflies in my stomach.

“It’s not like that, mom. He’s just my friend.”

She nodded and smiled. 

“I mean it! There’s nothing going on between us like that,” I said, and that part was true. She didn’t need to know how that made me feel. 

She just chuckled in that wise way she always did. 

“I believe you. I said the same thing. And now you’re here.”

For some reason, that kind of made me want to cry. Instead, I just finished my dinner as my mom sat with me and hummed to herself. 

With the storm of thoughts and emotions raging inside me, being in her presence was soothing. By the time my bowl was empty, I could barely keep my head up. 

“Bring him here,” she said as she took my empty plate to the sink,“I’ll make fry bread.”

I had to fight through a yawn to answer.

”I’ll do my best. No promises.”

Even if he had been my worst enemy, everyone deserves a chance to try my mom’s cooking. I’d have to drag him away from the farm kicking and screaming, but I’d manage it somehow. I’d break a wrist again if that’s what it took. 

The dark in the hallway walking to my bedroom was monster-free. They were still around; I could sense them licking their teeth as they waited out in the trees. But they couldn’t get me here. So I crawled into bed to the sound of my mom washing dishes in the kitchen, knowing she’d come tell me goodnight before she went to bed herself. Even if I wasn’t awake to hear it. Hollyhock was waiting for me, as usual, and I gave her sweet head a scratch.

As I closed my eyes, and sleep began pulling me under, I knew that somewhere out there, a princess was plotting, and a prince was sleeping in a pair of overalls. And not a single shadow in this sorry world could stop either of them.

1qew6rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1qew6rx/my_colposcopy_and_cervical_biopsy_experience/,my colposcopy and cervical biopsy experience [Positive],"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to quickly recap my experience to add to the pantheon of results you get when you google “colposcopy experiences reddit” in an anxiety induced haze in anticipation of your procedure. 

I recently was diagnosed HPV positive including strains 16/18 - no symptoms or anything, got an abnormal pap and that was that.

Prior to the visit, I was prescribed 5mg IR oxycodone to calm my nerves and help with pain. Unfortunately, there werent clear instructions on when I should take it in advance of my appt, so i guessed and took it about an hour before. But - we showed up 30 mins early, so i kind of started to freak a bit. I was imagining that during the procedure i’d be far away floating on a cloud, possibly drooling a bit, but to be honest - I dont think it kicked in until after the fact, so I was still SUPER nervous when I arrived at the clinic. 

I took a urine test, and then i was asked to disrobe and given a warm compress to apply to my pelvic area.  I wanted to wait until I started to feel the drugs but as soon as I left the bathroom they took me into the exam room had me disrobe so it all happened kinda fast. When my doctor came in I told her about my concerns and she said that they'd apply a local anesthetic and that typically the pain isn't normally too intense.

So, after numbing my doc proceeded with both the colposcopy and cervical biopsy. The colposcopy was first, it was uncomfortable but NOT at all what I had imagined. At times it was like a sort of dull ache, similar to how I feel sometimes when ovulating or pre-period cramping. There was a sort of uncomfortable feeling of something digging at me, but I wouldn't say it was painful, just unpleasant.

She did apply vinegar and got to work. It was uncomfortable, but the actual pain level was maybe 2-3 at most. She took 4 biopsies because one of them needed to be re-done, and communciated with me throughout.

The biopsy of the cervix was next - she said that my cervix was “cooperative” lol which may be why my biopsy wasn’t as bad as I’d expected? She applied that liquid bandage stuff that ends up coming out of you like coffee grounds, didn't hurt but it is kinda gross after the fact. Honeslty, this was less painful than the colposcopy, at times I didn't really feel much of anything. Taking the speculum out and all of that was more painful than the experience itself.

Once I was finished, I also had to get my 1st round of HPV vaccine. That honestly hurt more than the entire biopsy, lol.

As I walked back into the office, I started to feel really faint and hot. I think that either the biopsy, vaccine, or combination of both got to me and I had a vasovagal response. I do get this way after a blood draw, but it took me by surprise this time. If you have a history of this, make sure to tell your doctor. I had to go back and lie down for 15 more mins with an ice pack and some apple juice. So embarassing, lol.

I’m one day post and I have a sort of faint cramping in my pelvic region and some spotting of the liquid bandage, but so far nothing too major.

My biggest advice is to advocate for yourself and try as best you can to not psych yourself out day of. Breathing excercises really helped me here. Try to take your mind off of things by making small talk with the doctors or asking questions. It helped me to focus elsewhere during the procedure.

I highly recommend asking for local anesthetic, go as far as to ask them to document refusal in your chart if they are being pushy. I was lucky to have a great Dr that was sensitive to my concerns.

Best of luck to everyone who has to get this done! ",1,1768606631.0,HPV,0,1.0,False

I’m someone who keeps life pretty simple and prefers depth over noise. I’m not the loudest person in the room and I’m completely fine with that. I warm up best in one on one conversations where there’s room to actually think, joke, and be yourself without performing.

My schedule isn’t the typical nine to five, which can be unpredictable but also means I’m around at odd hours and down for spontaneous conversations. When the seasons are warmer, I spend as much time as I can outside exploring trails, paddling on the water, camping, or just enjoying fresh air. Colder months usually mean slowing things down with a book, a solid cup of coffee, a good series, and calm nights in.

I’m not chasing intensity or expectations. I’m here for easy conversations, shared humor, thoughtful exchanges, and the kind of connection that develops naturally. Friendship is the goal, and if it becomes something ongoing, even better.

‘Say like there was a scandal with a missing child on Sesame Street.’ Jessie felt her back stick to the dress she was wearing. She had chosen this thin, light dress for that exact reason, because ever since the call, she had been sweating pretty abnormally. Nervousness and anxiety exacerbates these things for her, and it was annoying and she needed it to stop, and to calm herself, Jessie started chatting randomly with the taxi driver who looked like a weary and tired eastern European white bald man with a handlebar mustache.

‘How could that happen?’ He asked seriously in a deep voice.

‘It’s just a scenario. I mean, would the police suspect and arrest big bird first thing when they find out?’ Jessie squeezed her purse on her lap. ‘This is so stupid. There are actual bad people in the world, and they go and arrest my big bird’

‘They arrested big bird?’ Again, very serious.

‘No, it’s my Max, but she might as well be big bird’

‘Your Max is big bird? Wow, arrested now?’ Too serious.

‘No, she’s not big bird, she’s like big bird, cause Max is nice and these accusations are too stupid I can’t process it’

‘Sounds hard, but we are here’ He looked back, and Jessie saw genuine concern on his face as she paid the fare.

‘Keep the change. Also, also my Max is not the actual bird, she is kind of like that I mean’ Jessie wondered if this guy would go on and tell other people that the sesame street big bird got arrested after dropping her off.

‘I agree’ And they both just stared at each other for a few moments in silence, the engine running, people in uniforms moving about next to the gate leading to the building, and now she was sure he was totally going to tell people just that.

Jessie closed the car door and saw the taxi leave slowly, too slowly, he must still be processing the conversation they just had, poor guy was too tired to process anything and Jessie wondered if it was safe to drive sleep deprived and tired, probably not, but it was not driving under the influence so not really a crime, even if this was just as dangerous.

It was like walking across the bridge to the castle where evil lives, there really is a menacing air to government buildings like this, the brutal architecture didn’t help Jessie thought trying to find her way to the waiting room/reception area that Sara had described for her. Inside was an aura that seeped through clothes straight into your soul, hallways feeling like they were full of malevolent ghosts fallen to injustice roaming to find retribution from these officers that bellow the black smoke of oppression from under their shoes with every step. 

Jessie was waiting in front of the door, asking her anger to calm down because her thoughts felt so off and full of rage that on her way over she had felt like smashing all the doors she had come through until she found Max and took her home like some sort of heroine with amazing magical powers from a story that saves the good and innocent folk, and punishes evil, an evil that is a place like this.

The door opened slowly. There was a weight to it, or was it she didn’t actually want to open it and face the things coming her way? Someone pounced on Jessie when she entered the room, and she was too shocked at first to notice the pain of Sara's collarbone pressing on her nose; seconds later, Jessie understood what was happening and hugged her back. Things must be really dire for her to be acting like this. When Sara let go, Jessie walked over to where Rich was sitting. He had one leg up on the other and seemed busy texting and frowning.

‘Lawyer?’ Jessie asked, stopping in front of him.

‘Already done and done, you need to talk with them for an information interview or something, I already did, that there Max’s actual did so too,’ Rich pointed at Sara who was sitting in a chair now trying hard not to look their way, embarrassed? ‘I’m not supposed to coach you in what to say as she is my daughter, and I am not going to, but you actually know Max and her character.’

‘HEY!’ A person wearing a necklace-style badge over civilian clothes came bursting through a door at the other end from the one she came in. ‘I told you to let me know when she arrived.’

‘I was not talking to her,’ Rich told him a bald-faced lie and went back to his phone, smirking.

‘You come with me now’ A buzz-cut, middle-aged, portly person of color, a heavy accent that she could not place, dripped through the venom of his words.

He led her through door after door, hallway after hallway, with rooms named in code, probably intentionally to make it confusing. They asked her to sit at a table in a room with the code name -S.P.I.R.-. Jessie felt that aura wafting towards her in this room again, telling her she was guilty, guilty just by being here, whatever that meant. It had no actual meaning inside her mind, but the emotional side was squeezing her chest in, slowly. Instinctively, she went to the phone to text Sara and saw that she was missing both her purse and phone, and wondered at what point they had removed those from her being.

Time passed excruciatingly slowly while she sat in the metal chair, rigid and stony, a thousand scenarios of doom running across her mind, but in all those thousands, in each and every one, Max was innocent. She could have walked in while a crime was being committed; and everyone in the world suddenly became mentally ill and accused her of things that never happened without even trying to find the truth of it, and someone framed her again.

The door opened, and a young average looking well-groomed person in uniform walked in with a clipboard and pen attached by wire. He sat down opposite her and eyed her up and down, then wrote something on the first page.

‘Please state your full name,’ Gruff youthful voice.

‘Jessie James,’ she answered.

‘Current address?’

‘Flat 6 - Apartment 4BL, on Erstwhile Road.’ Her voice cracked, and he looked up and then went back to writing or checking the information. Jessie cleared her throat for the next question.

‘And how long have you shared this apartment with Maximum Clover?’

‘Eight years this year’ Wow, that’s a long time, Jessie thought.

‘Nature of relationship with Maximum Clover?’ Just as he said it, Jessie wanted to ask him to stop using her full name. It felt weird to her because they tried hard never to mention it in full.

‘Close friend and roommate,’ she answered again and felt tired. Why did this feel so slow?

‘Noticed any changes in the behavior of Maximum Clover in recent years or weeks?’

‘No, she had only that one personality, routine and job as long as I had known her.’

‘Keep your answers short. Answer the same question again, this time carefully’ He eyed her, and Jessie felt her face flush in anger. He could probably see it in her eyes, she knew.

‘No,’ Jessie answered again.

‘No need to be so emotional’ His eyes bored straight into hers, and Jessie wondered how it would feel to shove that pen straight into them. Jessie looked down at the table and felt disgusted at how she had felt then, thinking like that. This was Max, but yes, this was Max.

‘Maximum Clover, has she appeared secretive, anxious or stressed about a specific part of her life’

‘No’ Jessie decided this person didn’t actually care at all about the truth of things; she had heard that a specific type of people always sought jobs of authority and governance, and this man sitting across from her matched all the stereotypes that caused people to hate authority.

‘To your knowledge, Maximum Clover, has she ever been in trouble with the law before?’

‘Not to my knowledge, no’ First time hearing such a flat tone in her own voice, it was surprising.

‘How did she respond to stress and conflict in the shared apartment?’ 

‘She wasn’t confrontational or violent and always looked to settling things calmly with dialogue’ Jessie answered and saw him stop and stare inside her head again, but this time the bastard smiled, Jessie knew at this point he thought he had won something happening here.

‘From people close to you and Maximum Clover, you must have heard what she is accused of, the investigation is ongoing, Maximum Clover is a suspect, not guilty until a jury of her peers declares her guilty, would you be willing to give a personal statement on this matter’ He placed the clipboard down and leaned back in his seat.

‘Yes, I know the details of her arrest, and no, I will not give a personal statement, and I require a lawyer for further questioning like that,’ Jessie said, surprised that she could speak like this.

The anger of the situation and this man was arranging all her usual haphazard thoughts in order, deleting all the jokes, lighthearted musings, and idiocy that normally runs through her mind.

‘You are not the one under investigation to require a lawyer, Miss Jessie James; this is a clarification interview only. You mentioned earlier that the accused is a close friend, is that right?’

‘Yes, she is a close friend.’ The hum of the artificial and the whine of electricity running from fixtures and appliances inside the room were overpowered, and it felt hostile inside this place. Jessie must have said something that had made this man furious; if he had a snake tongue, the slithery tones on the enunciation of words would be prominent. 

'I am sorry, someone can use a statement later during court proceedings, so if they force me to provide one, I would require legal counsel in case I might say something damaging to someone I think of as close.' This came out meek and begging from Jessie, and she felt a little ashamed of her own weakness.

‘Once again, keep your answers precise and short, when you mention damaging, what is this damaging thing you might say when speaking of Maximum Clover, as an example,’ He was drawing a hanging rope on the corner of the paper, not even glancing in her direction anymore.

‘That is childish, I don’t know, something wrong’ Jessie felt confused. What was the point of this interview anymore, to enrage her?

‘Again, don’t be emotional with your answers. Do you require legal counsel to further this interview?’ He had drawn a face inside the noose and a body and right arm below it. ‘Would it be all right if we provided you with legal counsel and resumed the interview afterwards?’ With the pen ready to draw the left arm, Jessie was staring straight at it and answered slowly.

‘No, I do not require legal counsel, please continue’ And she saw the officer go to the already drawn right arm and cancel it by scribbling a big X over it.

‘Would you be willing to provide a statement on the character of Maximum Clover?’ He looked up, and his pen hovered over the paper, ready to draw the left arm again.

‘Max has never been in trouble with the law before. She has worked at a toy factory charity over ten years that specializes in granting children their wishes with custom toys and plushies and she is the kindest and nicest person I have ever known all my life, that is my final statement,’ with her last words he crossed out the entire noose and body, signed the bottom of the page in her view, head down, staring up at her face with a smile at the corner of his mouth.

‘What is a plushy?’ He looked up and stared at her face again. The deep stare was very uncomfortable to return, so she inspected anything and everything inside this gray metallic room.

‘A soft stuffed toy usually made with cloth and stuffing,’ Jessie said weakly. Her throat was dry, and the interview kept going and going.

‘All right, are you comfortable being contacted again? Should further clarification be required,’ 

‘Yes,’ she answered, and he got up and extended his hand for her to shake. Jessie got up and clasped it for him to squeeze and let go.

‘Thank you, the officer outside will escort you back’ He walked out, and she followed, the world around her felt heavy as she went back to the room with Rich and Sara, where she sat in a chair, sad, angry and depressed with the situation.

\#

'Are these people idiots? Imbeciles of the lowest nature, useless organic waste.’ Jessie was fuming with anger inside the security room of the building, waiting for the perpetrator to come into view.

‘I think so too; this should not have happened’ Sara was on the other side with Rich. The security in charge was in the chair, bored with watching the footage on the monitor with them.

‘I don’t know how this would affect the investigation, but obviously this is not good at all,’ Rich sighed and buttoned up his jacket; the air was chilly inside the room.

‘They, the police, the idiot police, left the door open for this to happen’ Jessie was swinging her hands while talking, angry at this whole situation.

""Only Max's belongings were taken,"" Rich said. ""The tablets and laptop; none of your things were touched.""

‘I know; now it looks like a setup to hide evidence,’ Jessie spoke up.

‘This stupid situation escalating into a conspiracy is one thing we don’t need to exonerate Max from the kidnapping,’ said Sara this time.

‘I will send the video from the hospital room; it looks damning,’ Rich told them and watched a man come into view in slow-motion.

The coldness of that statement and that picture of the man slowly walking towards the door of their apartment replaced Jessie’s blood with ice, he was wearing a hood and from the angle in which they were viewing the back of his head come into view first; they were seeing him walk from the end of the hallway balcony overlooking the street in which he was waiting out of the camera’s view; the perpetrator stopped at the apartment door and knocked, waited and then let himself in.

‘This is unbelievable; this sucks so much,’ Rich piped up, and started walking towards the door.

‘Hey, hey, leaving?’ Jessie grabbed his jacket sleeve.

‘Check your mail for the video, both of you, I need, I need some time to cool off and talk with the lawyer again and see if there is anything we can plan, Sara the officer below waiting, give him the CD with the footage when this guy finishes burning it,’ and he walked out.

The criminal came out of the apartment with Max’s backpack from her closet, and in it would be all her stuff, and Jessie studied him closely, hooded shirt looked the same, the same worn jeans.

‘Can you go back and pause when his shoes were in the picture, walking towards the door?’ Jessie asked the security guy, and he did so.

She leaned in and looked closely at the shoes, no red stripes on them, but everything else was the same. Eddie could have just worn other shoes; they were very noticeable.

‘Something up with him, Jessie?, someone you’ve seen before?’ Sara asked, studying him as best as she could with Jessie.

‘Once’ Jessie lied. ‘He was on the other side of the street spying on the apartment, I saw from my window while playing with Bby in my room’

‘How long ago was it’ Sara asked.

‘Months ago now,’ Jessie answered.

‘This system only keeps footage for fourteen days,’ the old security guard told them. ‘We already have the footage of him approaching the building, walking through the halls, but he kept his hood up and face out of view.’

‘All right,’ Sara said.

‘I’m going to finish this up,’ he said to Sara.

‘Go ahead,’ Sara told him and came over and placed her arms over Jessie’s shoulders. She has been very handsy ever since Max got locked up. handsy, clingy and sad.

‘Help me clean the apartment; the savages ran a tornado through trying to find evidence,’ Jessie asked her.

‘I’m confused. Shouldn’t the police have taken them before this guy? Why were they left lying around’ Sara spoke, and Jessie felt her breath tickle her ear.

Jessie answered her, ‘They bagged and prepared them. The officer went downstairs and said the door was locked when he left, but we can see right here that he lied.’

The security guard spoke up, saying, ‘The door was locked, so he used a key.’

‘What, that’s wrong? Are you sure?’ Jessie sputtered.

‘Absolutely, he had a key. We changed all the locks and handed you an envelope today.’ The progress bar on the monitor was nearly at its goal; he was copying it to a thumb drive.

‘I thought it was just a bill,’ Jessie squeezed her purse with the envelope inside. 

‘Scary, can’t understand the point of this, its just so stupid that there is nothing to gain, besides ruining her life, Max doesn’t even know how to make an enemy,’ Jessie felt Sara’s chin moving on the top of her head as she talked.

‘Same,’ said Jessie, and as soon as she said it, he unplugged the drive, placed it in a leather bag and handed it back over his shoulder. Sara took it and walked out. She went downstairs, and Jessie went to her apartment door and saw her small suitcase next to it. She had been sleeping in a hotel with Sara while they ransacked the apartment for the last four days.

Inside, it was just as she had imagined, paper, clothing strewn all over the apartment, furniture moved to find anything hidden behind them, mattresses on the floor of the rooms, and someone had disassembled and reassembled the TV shoddily. The person also did this thoroughly to every fixture, appliance and place that could hide something.

Jessie left her luggage at the door and started working on getting things in order like a zombie, she didn’t want to do it, wanted to sleep this day and get to it the next, but she knew deep inside if she left it as it is now, it will be like this for a long, long time.

Halfway Sara came in and without a word started moving the furniture back into place. Being taller and stronger, Jessie ended up depending on her for the heavy lifting and left her to them and went sweeping and ordering. Hours later, they finished and now sat on the sofa with her laptop on the coffee table watching the email link that took them to a server that hosted the video of the hospital room.

The nurse was next to the bedside talking with the little girl and slicing up a fruit onto a plate, after she was done with the fruit, she got up from her chair next to the bed and went over to the window opened it a little to the little girl clapping and laughing and saying a visible thank you repeatedly. 

The room must have been really stuffy for her. After the nurse sat back down, Max knocked on the door. The nurse went over, opened the door and talked to her first and then walked out when Max entered. She came over to the bed with the teddy bear, and the girl was ecstatic. She must be between seven and ten years old. Max walked around the bed and sat down in the chair the nurse had been in earlier, and they talked for a few minutes, and then it looked like Max became unresponsive because the girl kept touching her shoulder in concern. 

Jessie felt Sara shudder next to her as the window slowly opened and a hooded figure climbed into the room. The little girl stumbled back and fell to the floor in surprise and must have hurt herself as she lay writhing. The man ran over, and when he got to the other side, she scrambled under the bed and came out opposite and grabbed Max’s arm and shook her; she was screaming now, and the man was now panicking. He ran over and grabbed the girl who was hanging on to Max’s arm, and when he pried her off, the long scratches from her nails was noticeable on Max, it slowly became bloody when he took the girl to the window and exited the building. 

And yet, Max just sat in the chair motionless till the Nurse ran inside, went over to the window first then to Max and screamed in her face, and that was when she looked up at her and at her bleeding arm and to both Sara and Jessie it looked like she had just been there in a frozen daze when the entire abduction took place around her.

‘What the fuck was that?’ Jessie asked Sara. ‘She just sat there. What was wrong with her?’

‘Something like a stroke? Maybe’ Sara closed the laptop and laid back on the sofa. ‘Did you notice?’

‘Notice what?’ Jessie asked.

‘Same clothes as the guy who stole her stuff from this apartment,’ Sara told her.

‘Max would have told us if she had a health thing. It’s weird, but it looks like she just deliberately sat there,’ Jessie changed the topic back and felt the whole video had a creepy vibe to it.

‘The question is why?’ Sara wondered.

‘Is it blackmail? The reason he took the laptops and stuff? Her phone was with her when she was at the hospital. He didn’t take that?’ She laid back and felt Sara’s arm come down on her head and let her fingers drift slowly through her hair. Very handsy and weird, this girl was now becoming towards her, Jessie thought.

‘He could create a fake narrative to make it look like they were partners,’ Jessie said.

‘Exactly, that makes much more sense, but what did he do to keep her like that? Sara continued, ‘If it were a gas or something, it would have affected the girl, too.’

‘Yeah, what he did to Max is creepy’ Jessie felt herself calm down. The fingers on the scalp were strangely very soothing in this confusingly puzzling situation that had kept her blood pressure and heart rate high with anxiety. ‘Are there gas-type things that can paralyze someone?’

‘I don’t know, happens in TV shows,’ Sara said sadly. ‘It’s just an excuse. I need to think something happened instead of her just sitting there letting that happen. That’s not our Max.’

‘Hmm… I guess’ Jessie also knew that Max would not sit still while an abduction happened. ‘Maybe he threatened you or me?’

‘No, that doesn’t add up; she would have gone to the authorities with that as soon as she was threatened’

‘What about Minnie? She is fiercely protective of her little sister and the kids,’ Jessie asked.

‘That could make sense.’ Sara picked up her phone and walked to Max’s room and stopped at the door. ‘Gonna tell Rich and talk with him a bit, you can sleep if you want, I’ll keep dinner in the fridge for when you wake up’ 

‘Thanks, Sara.’ She smiled and walked into Max’s room, closing the door behind her.

Things were no longer where she expected them to be, treats ran out, the bread was never fresh this week, and visitation kept getting denied to see Max. Having Sara over, keeping her company, was a calming factor, otherwise Jessie felt like she would have flown off the handle ages ago, and it was terrifying how dependent she was on Max because almost everything revolved around how she always knew Jessie’s moods. 

When she wanted treats or wanted to laze Max would have it done and ready or do tasks in her stead that she felt too tired to do, have treats in stock and ready according to seasons and her likes, and knew when Jessie was in a touch starved mood and offered to watch a movie while she ran her fingers through her hair while Jessie laid on her lap which relaxed her so much she usually ends up asleep halfway through everything they watched.

 Max does this same thing when Jessie gets angry too, did Sara pick that up from her, that was cute, but still a little uncomfortable because it didn’t fit her character to be doing that, plus she felt contact was okay with Max, not so much with Sara.

Yes, all that sounds bad, but this was a give and take relationship and Jessie knew when Max was stressed and helped her the same way, and all these small little bites of care between them had solidified into a foundation of love, not the romantic kind, the kind the world revolves around according to Jessie as she stood at the living area giant window overlooking the street, ice cream cup in hand, waiting for a sign of Bby.

It was good that Sara didn’t get a description of Eddie. If she had known that was how he lurked around the world, she would have gone on a mission herself to find that cat and follow it to apprehend him herself. 

And for Jessie, the reason she didn’t feel like doing the same was that she picked up on every little quirky thing everyone around her did. Like how on Sara, you can see a corner come up a few seconds before she commits to a full on smile, as if she has to think if the thing that she found amusing required the effort of her giving that smile, or if it deserved one. And how Max tiptoes a little when walking when her happiness meter is full, it was a fun thing to watch as it was akin to ballet she dance/moves around the apartment while humming, and in all the years Jessie had not mentioned this in case she might get embarrassed and stop, now that would be a loss.

The man who broke in didn’t move like how she imagined Eddie would, there was a bit of cold and heartlessness to the movement in that character in both of the videos, stood way too straight when every time she had met Eddie he had a slight hunch like he was battling a sickness and he was, and that creep in the video went from slow to fast in increments like as if he was enjoying the chase and was playing at the hospital, and to Jessie Eddie looked like he was just too tired of the world to enjoy anything. 

But if she had to place one plus one and come to two, Eddie came up as a fantastic suspect, the fact she had not mentioned this to Rich or Sara that he could be responsible, is troubling even for her, and Jessie needed Bby to take her to Eddie as soon as possible, at least before Max becomes convicted and end up in jail. 

The other thing was that if Eddie was theoretically an evil person, the one he had to frame would have been Sara. Sara, who had asked Jessie to give him up to the investigator or police that day at the Patisserie. Having framed Max doesn’t add up for Eddie being guilty, which reminded that she still had to report him, and she felt tired at the thought of it.

Also, where was the call from an unknown number asking her to leave him alone if they wanted to exonerate Max from the crime of kidnapping? How that scenario would unfold is Eddie would deliver the girl to the authorities, and would later call and threaten he could ruin all their lives in a thousand ways and this Max thing was just a taste of what’s coming if they tried to apprehend him, that was probably how it would happen.

 Jessie walked towards the kitchen to see Sara walk out half asleep wearing one of Max’s band shirts and sweatpants, they were baggy for her and made her look like a beautiful disheveled slender fairy from a children’s fantasy, short hair people have it so easy.

‘I thought about making lunch for you, but I didn’t want to deal with all the criticism after, so,’ Jessie went to the fridge and took out another ice cream cup.

‘Rich called. Visitation denied again. He will bring more forms to sign, ran out of the ones we signed before,’ Sara yawned loudly and went back into the room.

‘Bleh.’ Jessie felt her blood boil again imagining those heartless people in uniform at that place.

She checked the street once more and went to her room, finished the ice cream again and went through the drawers of her desk to find the card of the investigator person and the picture of Eddie. 

She took a digital picture of the photograph using her phone and sent it to her laptop. Reverse image searched and found pictures and artwork of the style just like the last time she tried on her phone, it was weird that for someone who did a lot of murdering there were no news articles about it from anywhere in the world under that name, besides that were all random hits she got of people with Wiles as a last name on social media. 

She recalled Max saying that the chair was custom-made, making it a one-of-a-kind. 

She cropped the picture down to the chair and searched again and went through the results and found one that had an old man sitting in the same chair with the headline of “The Wiles of Alaska Timber Company Goes Soaring High.” 

After searching again with -Controversy Wiles Timber Company-, she found a few results from the 1960s, including one about a serial killer who targeted the family and was never caught, with the killings ending with the last survivor, who was in his early twenties.

Which meant that Eddie would be in his seventies now or higher. No wonder he looks so bad; man was just suffering from old age and untreated diabetes, probably. 

The other guy must be at death’s door too, and something else hit Jessie like a brick to her face. Eddie is too old to scale the second floor of that hospital building and leave with a young girl on his back without falling down. That was the thing. He had his face and head covered, but the gait of his walk, how he held himself, opened the heavy door of her apartment like it weighed nothing, this criminal was a young and healthy person. 

Eddie was innocent, Jessie felt the cloud of black smoke over her heart lift with that revelation and felt herself relax, no need to tell that investigator guy too, they were old people, let natural aging just take their story into history with no additional fresh pain.

She read the rest of the articles to see if his name came up. In all the names on that family tree until the killer systematically killed everyone, there was no mention of him, even as a suspect. Which was weird, because the family should have known it could only be one person, the guy they tormented so hard that his wife and kids died. 

Or, Eddie might have used a different last name, his wife’s, because he hated his family. Jessie felt a little disturbed when she closed the laptop. The entire story was true and until this moment inside her head. It felt fictional, like all the novels she read and thought Eddie was being dramatic.

 Plus, people lied all the time and embellished and stole things for conversation pieces, and she herself had witnessed her share of drama queens who claimed this and that all the time. Well, murder is something everyone avoided claiming having been done, even so now his words held a different weight to them, and her view of him had changed a little too, as a little thought strayed into his corner of her mind asking her to be wary next time they met.

The card that she got from Randy fluttered next to the laptop, Jessie picked it up and studied the name, Dean Cloister, P.I. Jessie took out her phone and dialed the number and it rang twice before a man’s voice spoke on the other end.

Dean - Hello.

Jessie - Hello, someone gave me the card.

Dean - Oh, from which area?

Jessie - Smart Mart, I got a lot of things correct and Randy at the counter said I should contact you directly now.

Dean - Yes, I was informed as well, wait a moment . . . This is Jessie James speaking, yes?

Jessie - Oh, yes, I forgot to say my name. I wanted to ask about something else.

Dean - All right, ask.

Jessie - can I hire you to find someone else?

Dean - Of course. Can we meet for specifics, perhaps?

Jessie -  Swan Sweet Patisserie, we could meet there, send me a date and time for an afternoon meeting please.

Dean - Will do, thank you for seeking me out. If you have any more information regarding my original request, it would be most helpful too.

Jessie -  We can talk then?

Dean - We can, bye.

Jessie - Bye.

She was staring at the phone thinking about the voice; it was deep and calming and he had this soft way with enunciating his words like how she talked sweetly with newborn giggling babes, and Jessie imagined how he could look and was fantasizing this and that when someone knocked at the door.

‘JESS, CAN YOU GET THAT, ITS DINNER AND LUNCH’ Sara was shouting from the half-open door of her room.

She walked out and double checked if it really was a delivery person before opening the big bolt to get the order, after dropping it all on the dining table, Jessie went over to the window of the living area and looked down to see “the man” staring up straight at her, hood over his face and a mask wearing sunglasses. 

She walked up closer and squinted to guess whether this was Eddie or the bad guy. If this was the bad guy, he was a really cheeky one, hanging around the place he robbed with people who knew that he had kidnapped a child. 

Jessie had her phone hidden from view in her hand next to her thigh. Her eyes moved from the phone to the man below as she slowly dialed the area’s police number, and as if he knew what she was doing he started running, and so fast it shocked the people who were walking along the pavement making them jump out of his path.

Maybe she will pay Dean additional to stay in this area and monitor the safety of her and Sara, her heart was now ramming against her rib cage, and it told her everything she needed to know about how unsafe this situation was becoming, on her phone screen the number was ready to be dialed, but she turned the screen off and went to the sofa instead, plopping over on it to lie down and calm herself. 

Jessie knew she needed to talk to Eddie as well. He claimed he could keep her safe too, an offer she couldn’t refuse anymore. Now if only Bby showed herself, she could go get him.",2,1768606451.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

# Episode 17

Mr Pei takes Hu Xiu to dinner. Her boss/ love interest Xiao Zhiyu is blowing up her phone all through dinner because someone is *jealous.*  He then arrives at the restaurant just as Mr. Pei is offering her a ride home. Torn between the two she eventually joins Xiao Zhiyu in his car. (*So freaking petty my man is)*

While on the ride home they get a call from Mr. Gong. He is worried about Zhao Xiaoruo being possessed by a ghost. Hu Xiu goes in to comfort her and finds out the truth: Guangming is having an affair. (*booo! All the tomatoes for the miser)*. Hu Xiu stays to comfort her best friend.

The next morning at Zhuling, Hu Xiu almost falls and is rescued by our male le-- excuse me I mean our *second* male lead. Mr Pei is pulling out all the wooing stops. *And if he wasn't our annoying 2nd lead I would actually adore him.*

[Mr. Pei is getting handsy and our male lead does. not. like. it.](https://i.redd.it/wr6cbv164tdg1.gif)

They take the elevator up and Mr. Pei reaches around Hu Xiu to press the button. *The look on Xiao Zhiyu's face! I have gifed it for all to see.* They talk about how he was the one Hu Xiu met in the elevator that day she came to interview at Zhuling.

Hu Xiu is presenting her ass off,-- very well and competent. She's so good at her job --  when Xiao Zhiyu steps in and asks about the other suppliers that Zhuling has omitted. He's after the suppliers for finding out about the secret of the stadium, but only we know that. Hu Xiu just thinks he's nitpicking.

Meanwhile, at the Coffee shop a pipe bursts and gets the whole cafe. Mr. Gong comes over and helps Zhao Xiaoruo put her shop back together. She talks in an extended metaphor about the pipe bursting but it was actually about her marriage and how she saw the signs but ignored them

*Be still my shipper heart, I love Mr. Gong immediately coming over and bringing all his employees just to clean up a shop. Get this man a partner PLEASE.*

Xiao Zhiyu tries to talk to Hu Xiu on the way back to Dynamism but gets interrupted by Mr Sun, the engineering manager. After a few hijinks and hilarious redirections, Xiao Zhiyu gets to be alone with Hu Xiu. He explains he trusts her and that her presentations were good. He just wanted to see all the suppliers and didn't mean to usurp her.

Later they walk into a dark tunnel and Xiao Zhiyu has a flashback/ nightmare he's had before. He comes around the corner to see Hu Xiu standing in the spotlight, the only light in his dark tunnel.

* Did anyone else notice, at least on iqiyi, that the translation for Zhuling is different and they kept calling it Forma? It was annoying.
* This episodes is the extended metaphor episode. Everyone is talking in code and not saying what they mean

My main issue is that I genuinely don’t understand what’s wrong with me.



To explain, I’ll give an example. I meet someone new and we start talking. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, and we get closer over time. This happens with both male and female friends, and there’s nothing romantic about it at all. Everything seems fine. We talk every day, stay up late chatting, spend a lot of time together, go out, get coffee, eat together .  basically, normal friend things.



Then suddenly, everything changes. Sometimes in a single day, even within 24 hours, the whole dynamic is gone.



It’s awful. I feel horrible and betrayed. The pain feels similar to a breakup or heartbreak, except it’s not romantic , it’s losing someone unwillingly and without any clear reason.



I’ve asked former friends multiple times if I did anything wrong, if there were any red flags or issues on my side. None of them ever pointed out anything specific. They usually say they’re “too busy” or give some other excuse, which honestly feels like a lie.



At this point, I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why this keeps happening.



Today (and yesterday), I was ghosted again by a friend. This time it really broke me. I had put so much hope and effort into this friendship. I don’t even wish for many friends anymore ... I just wish I had one person I could go out with and not constantly be afraid of losing overnight.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but this affects me deeply. It has caused trust issues, and I’ve lost motivation to have a social life or even try anymore. Everything feels pointless.

I truly don’t know what to do or why this keeps happening to me.",1,1768606146.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

However, I’ve worked there over two years and am currently working towards a masters degree to be an LPC (licensed professional counselor) and the job continues to stack responsibilities on all of us but zeroooooo additional pay. I sometimes have to take the work home, even mentally I take it home. Each task is simple but overall it is a stressful job and even if you’re caught up on work, if you ask off for a few days you will be behind again because of the workload we have. 

I work 9-5 and have class twice a week 6:30-9:20. I am at the point where I’m beyond burnt out, but it pays the bills and is stable. 

I’m considering working a job at a coffee shop I used to work at where I’d be making $2 less, but would be up for review in 3 months for a raise with the potential promotion to be an assistant manager there if it works well with school - I previously asked the hiring manager about this and they said I could apply to be the assistant manager if I’d like to be in the near future and it’s more pay. But for now the position that would work best with school is less. 

I can work more hours there and make tips where my current job doesn’t allow overtime even when I need to work longer hours to meet deadlines. 

I have applied for 6 months to other jobs and haven’t gotten any bites, I would be able to afford rent and the basics with a little leftover. I \\\*dread\\\* my job now but I could make do with the other one and hate my life less lol. But the budget would be tight

(As a first time stimulant user),"TLDR: I was diagnosed with ADHD I’ve tried 20, 30 and 40mg vyvanse. I felt some energy & relief for two - three hours but had bad side effects so I’m now starting adderall. I felt nothing from 10mg, about one hour of relief from 20mg x2 daily.

In my last psychiatrist appointment she asked me if I wanted to continue going up on my vyvanse to see if it would effect me at a higher dose or try adderall I agreed to try adderall because I felt like vyvanse gave me headaches, made me feel way dehydrated, dizzy and have bad circulation. So she put me on adderall IR because of my work schedule, so I am prescribed to take 10mg twice a day. She said if that did not feel effective to try 20mg twice a day. We meet again in two weeks to discuss.

Yesterday I felt energized/ slight mood lift for one hour after taking 20mg and then after I felt SO TIRED. If I stayed sitting down I would’ve fell asleep. If I had work yesterday I would’ve been fucked. Today I took my 20mg in the morning and felt a little social / excited for about 45 min. I just took my second dose an hour ago and feel basically as if I sipped a little coffee.

I am completely new to stimulants, and was diagnosed with adhd in my mid twenties which I am now. I don’t know what a life without my symptoms feel like / do not know how it supposed to feel . I’m feeling a little lost and defeated because after getting diagnosed I was so relieved that a doctor finally listened to me telling them I knew I was not only depressed. My brain repeats the same cycles daily that push me further into depression and this year I learned that was my severe ADHD.

I am staying hydrated, eating a bit before and trying to eat less high fat. Any tips or tricks? Any teas you enjoy drinking in the morning or go to snacks ? Some people said to take it with coffee but I am weary of possible panic attacks.

(I am also on my period which I heard can reduce efficacy. Is this true? Maybe it was a bad time to start adderall ? )",1,1768606049.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I forget exactly what it is that he ""Eddie"" did there, but he was also working there temporarily. For the first half of the school year, they didn't talk much at all. But overtime, they became friends. It would be the two of them, and another girl that would sometimes get coffee together.

Eventually Frida and Eddie became close enough that they would be very flirty with each other. He would kiss her forehead when he he was walking with her to her car to say goodbye. He even bought her an iced coffee a couple of times when they went to get coffee together. It even got to the point where they would go to this really nice mall which is like 45 minutes away. She told me that after every hang out work, it would almost always end with them making out in the car.

She developed a massive crush on him of course. Because the thing is, they would text about random things. They saw each other close to every day. There was one time when she was joking with him over text about him owing her an iced coffee. So he made a joke saying, ""I'll put something in your mouth"". She texted ""damn at least take a girl out on a date first"". He said ""what do you think our dates have been then?"" (he retroactively referred to their past hangouts of them going for coffee or to the mall as dates even though he never labeled that as such when they were happening).

When school let up for the summer, they went to the mall together. Got lunch together. Walked around for a couple of hours. It ended with her losing her virginity to him in the car parking lot. She was really excited when she told me about it the next couple days after. How gentle he was. How he asked her if she was OK. They met for coffee one more time after that. And then he ghosted her. Stopped replying to her messages. 

He's entitled, not because he's a guy in his 20s that just wants to have a casual relationships. But because he deliberately pretended to be her friend for months. It wasn't like she was just a girl at the club that he met one night and slept with her and then ghosted her. They worked together.

Anyway, I’ve had a case of my favorite beer in the garage since Christmas (was a present). I just decided I was gonna have a couple because I’ve been good lately. No alcohol, eating healthy, exercising, etc. Not to mention I had a late coffee and thought it would help me be able to sleep later. 

Cracked one. Stared at it. Thought about it. Smelled it. Ultimately I want to get in better shape. I thought about how there’s 200+ calories in one of these beers. I thought about how I’d likely end up having 4-5 and then eating like shit. Then feeling shitty tomorrow. And that tomorrow I’d feel full of regret. 

Not this time. I poured it out. I’d pour out the rest but I don’t want to admit to my family that it’s that big of an issue. I plan to give them to a friend soon.

\- walked into my room without my permission to verbally threaten me that she will kick me out if i tell anyone else about her personal life because shes a very private person although she kept telling me about them when I DIDNT ASK

\- walked into my room when i wasnt at home (i have a camera in my room) but stopped doing that after she realised shes on camera

\- doesnt allow me to put eggs in the fridge as she said she put chocolate in the fridge and eggs will make them smell (my eggs will spoil in SUNNY SG?)

\- doesnt allow me to put luggage in the cupboard as she thinks theyre dirty and i can only put on the floor

\- doesnt allow me to steam iron clothes in my room as she thinks the moisture will make the carpentry grow mould only can do it in kitchen

\- doesnt allow me to leave my hangers at the hanging area but she leaves hangers there herself (calls me out and said its been there for many days and when am i keeping it but i wanted to leave it thr since its a hanging spot?)

\- literally told me im not allowed to buy groceries anymore as the holidays were coming and she wants to stock up the fridge even though she used over 80% of it and all my things only take up LESS than half a shelf of the entire full body fridge in total

\- and when i replied to that grocery ban and how i only use 1/3 of a single shelf in the whole fridge already she goes a full on red herring and said “i didnt know u will be so bothered by my comment” and that “pls keep to the max of ur current space” in the fridge lmao i tot she will at least divide equally

\- always touch shifts my things in the fridge for wtv reasons and talk about how putting stuff in the fridge door will spoil it etc when she puts most of the things and i have like 3 items? But somehow its my fault when she fears the fridge door will be overworked cool

\- doesnt allow me to wash my clothes after 11pm (must finish by then)

\- asked me to put my crockery in the kitchen cabinet then threatens to make me pay for carpentry as she thinks its not fully dried and the cabinet will grow mould, then asked me to put it in the drying rack

\- after i put on the rack (again as per her instructions) scolded me saying if i do that she has no space to put her crockery and demand i remove my crockery by her stated time the next morning (she always give ultimatum like that when she speaks)

\- repeatedly inform (or warn?) me that she links my aircon to her phone and can see which temperature i on and how long i use/when i use my ac every day (i am only allowed to use at night)

\- has a 24/h motion following and night vision camera in the living room that she claim is for her pet but somehow when shes on vacay its always set to facing the kitchen to watch me?

\- said that her thumbprint door has camera etc and whenever i leave/enter the house she gets informed (okay?)

\- controls what light i can use when i cook (i am not allowed to own the warm lights for some reason only white light and she will always scold/change it when she see me using warm light even tho i keep the kitchen spotless??)

\- sends a long message to warn me “i hope this is the last time i have to remind u…” because there was like 4 drips of water in the whole kitchen NOT even because there was a puddle or anything but because she hates it when theres a single water droplet in kitchen area coz she says she has OCD

\- always accuses me of not washing my hands whenever she sees me cooking just because she was in the room when i was washing my hands, she will phrase it as “u didnt wash ur hands before u cook?” So offensive wtf (once i was packing food for a colleague she accused the same thing and even tho i said i did wash my hands she could just not believe me and tell my colleague i didnt and ruin my reputation like that bruh)

\- constantly monitoring everything i do/own such as what i buy in the fridge and picks them up then judges verbally how the food/brands i buy are cheap/fake like okay sorry IM CHEAP IM CHEAP can?? I dont buy french butter like u so what?

\- and how i have to keep the frozen meat even though i ALREADY used ziplock bags etc to keep to the highest hygiene standards she has to warn beforehand

\- and how i removed shoes from the shoe rack and confronted me if im moving out and when i said its just because they grow mouldy when i put outside, she claimed that its already in the contract that im NOT allowed to put shoes in my room (its not I checked so she lied)

\- we work in the same department where i interned at (she doesnt use reddit) and she bitches about every colleague every single day using very horrible words like a reject, loser, theyre lonely etc to humiliate them even if theyre my bosses, just because of very small matter that i dont even find reasonable (eg asking her to buy coffee when shes a literal PA, not greeting her on their 1st day of work, or booking meeting rooms) but she took offence of it

\- it has reached a pt where i dont dare to go out of my room when shes at home because she will ALWAYS start speaking to me and its ALWAYS her bitching about our colleagues and tbh i rly like some of them a lot but i dont dare to go against her or disagree coz im worried ill piss her off

\- and honestly IM NOT HER FRIEND idc abt her n every chat w her shes so negative and puts people down/insults them she also always mock me and say “r u sure ur from (big3) and r u sure ur a scholar?” Over small unrelated things like BRUH U ASKED ME ABT MY EDUCATION stop using it against me i

\- when another colleague was jokingly saying that i was “bullying them” as a joke, she then said “this is why i dont like to talk to (my name)” and when i said “huh? U always go and talk to me??” She said “no i dont, its my kid that always talks to u i dont like to talk to u” shes not even joking idk y must she make this comment in office when we werent even talking to her in the first place like ok I SUCK AT TALKING THEN? Must u tell everyone how bad i am?

\- threatens me that she will bitch abt me to one of my bosses whom i looked up to a lot if i get on her bad side and weaponises this fact so i wont dare to disobey her in any way

\- always bragging (or warning?) me about how she used various methods to “get revenge” on people/colleagues who pissed her off in the past for the smallest reasons and make me so scared of pissing her off in fear that she will do the same to me (long story short a guy always take a seat she likes in office coz our company has an ad-hoc/non fixed seating policy so got angry and fake cried out loud in office, she claims she can cry on command, and make the guy get in trouble and apologise to the whole department, but when he bought chocolate to apologise to her she rejected his offer)

\- i dont even dare to tell anyone in office for mths because im v young & juz and intern & juz joined while shes the aunty everyone likes and talks to i guess? (While she literally bitch abt them behind their backs lmao) and ofc she threatened to kick me out if i ever say anything too so dont dare initially but at this point JUST END ME

\- always bragging/complaining that everyone in office likes to talk to her but she actually hates it when they do because shes an introvert and find them very annoying

\- will message me to off the lights because she got prompted on her pet camera even though i havent even on it for long yet (and just havent off them)

\- had to pass me something so she added a hook on my room door but knocked on my door at late night to get the hook back not even because she needs it she just wants it back to keep if?? Like its a fucking hook that u dont even need y r u so scared ill take/use it or what? Wtf

\- call me out like “o i heard u hav been coughing recently? I dont want to be sick” etc basically always watching to see if i fall sick and then warn beforehand that she dont want me to fall sick coz it may spread to her like IF U DUN CARE U CAN JUST SHUT UP?

\- she will literally tell me food she bought that she thinks taste like shit and ask me to finish them so she wont waste food/money (bruh at least pretend u like it and not offer me because u dont want it)

\- tell me her food is expiring so she ask me to eat them too even though for the past like 2 mths she had it she didnt offer me but only did because it was expired and she couldn’t finish it (bruh im ur dustbin??) she does the same thing to office btw where she will “share” her food with the office to everyone but the truth is its been on the table for a mth and is expiring so she suddenly decided she wants to share lol

\- the contract ONLY has clause for landlord to terminate but not for tenant at all and i havent met the 6 months hdb min. Period so im so scared she will force me to pay the whole year or up to 6 months (she has my deposit too)

\- i only found out after i moved in but before me she rented to 4 different tenants within the 1.5 years she bought the flat, and all moved out before their contract ends (she rented to working adult, her relative, and international students)

\- she will speak to me rudely like when how a mother is calling out her children for misbehaving etc (we have a 20 year gap and im in my early 20s) such as “ Ah ah ah I already said right? What is this? U better \_\_\_\_” basically like how she lectures her fucking kid although i am her co worker and tenant NOT her kid

\- how she screams at her young kid (when the kid comes over) is insane too she will legit go hysterical and screams at the top of her sharp voice for over 10mins and tell her kid things like how she dont even like to talk to her kid and etc etc over v small things like eating slow? she beats her kid sometimes when lecturing but tbh the way she overreact is borderline and questionably abuse…

\- her kid is also another fked up one, that kid beats me btw (like repeatedly tries to hit me the kind when u throw a fit) whenever i lose in a game for eg when i was trying to fucking play with the kid out of compassion and scolds me for being annoying/always losing the game or kept saying “omg” because I obviously cannot swear to a kid so what else can i say when im playing game?

\- her kid also tell me that i look old for my age, im very short (she is literally over 2 heads shorter than me), and told my female colleague that her voice sounds like a man during a bring ur kid to office day

\- other colleagues also told me she ignores them when they greet her etc (theyre all juniors like me) but shes v nice when talking to the directors LMAO

\- every word i say she use it as a promise and use it against me “but u said, u promised earlier…” even though i tot we were just DISCUSSING?!?!

\- she literally judges and watches everything i hav/do and make comments like “i didnt see u wash ur bedsheets at all…” when I DID I JUST DID IT WHEN UR NOT HOME WHY MUST I PROVE IT TO U? Stop judging and insinuating that im unhygienic??

\- insinuates and make comments like “why dont i see u go out with friends on the weekend?” Basically hinting that like issit i have no friends? Whats wrong with me as a person? Even tho i did i just didnt tell her? Then she said “oh i thought whenever u go out is just to work” WHY MUST U JUDGE MY SOCIAL LIFE TOO?

\- passive aggressive and say things like “ill be VERY annoyed if u move out bef contract ends” etc and insinuates that she will do/say smt to my colleagues

\- she DEADASS said no one in our office is pretty and shes the prettiest AND SHES NOT EVEN JOKING… (shes not even close tbh theres 2 that a lot of us find v pretty but she said “theyre juz above avg but not pretty”) ok… wtv u say bro…

\- ALL THESE for a room 12-18mins walk from the nearest MRT & at the extreme corner of SG (think woodlands/changi kind)

OKAY BEFORE I GET HATE

yes i regret and I shouldn’t have rented from my colleague but i did that even though i never had intention to rent out because she was telling me how her life sucks, she doesnt even hav an ite diploma (shes a support team in my dept, like a PA to the bankers) and cant find tenants for months and cant pay mortgage and is a single parent (kid and house went to the ex btw she got another house herself)  so i pitied her from the goodness of my heart i feel so dumb because thats how she treats me after i rent from her out of goodwill

HONESTLY i dun even dare to tell her the real reason i want to move out is coz she is INSANE bc honestly im so scared she will do something to me she has my IC info when i signed contract n stuff and she works w all my colleagues she can just bitch abt me, a new incomer that im a horrible person etc that broke contract and my reputation is gone. Oh and she always say like “u have no reputation already” like… wtf?!?!? Not to mention she knows my weakness which is that im very afraid she will ruin my image by bitching abt me to a boss i look up to a lot and i feel like a hostage held in prison that i rather stay in office and pretend i need to OT than to go home early and have to see her face",2,1768605395.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

Happy New Year, hope that you had some awesome coffees during the break. 

Here is the current code - COFFEEFOR2026 - or use[ this link](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/discount/COFFEEFOR2026) for 10% off coffee, and until next update will also work on Mavo, Apax water, and Sibarist products. 

Lots of updates, bunch of new coffee please check the site haha. But we do have this hidden Colombia geisha bundle - [here.](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/products/colombia-las-margaritas-geisha-washed-natural-bundle)

**New Products and Restocks**: Brewista 600ml kettle just got here, sibarist restock in a few days, we got fun OREA O1 colours, all the new comandante, Avensi Wave colour carafes and glasses, Hario Meteor paper, MHW F74 grinders as well. 

**USA situation:** still a mess, but just manageable. I want to be more transparent here. There are a few ways we are shipping to USA currently with standard shipping. 

1. Canada Post: Shipping with Canada Post get passed through to USPS. Once it reach USA, then tracking with USPS will have more details. The same tracking number works. Still a bit slow on transit. 
2. Consolidation: This mean that your orders is shipped out with USPS at our warehouse, put in a big box, go to a warehouse in California and then it get picked up by USPS. Nothing is stock at the warehouse and everything comes from our shop here in Canada. You will se some delay in scan, and the customer in California will get the parcel quite fast but some customers in the East Coast might be slow to get them.
3. FedEx: depending on where you are and your order, we might ship with FedEx, generally fast, but we have had some issue with custom clearance, and have seen some parcel delayed by more than 2 weeks. But most orders with FedEx will arrive within 2-4 business days. It is also an options at checkout. 

While these process is a bit slow, it helps keep free shipping threshold down and keep things more affordable with tariff. Do note that with USA shipping, it require us to do quite a bit of paperwork for each order. Coffee? Prior Notice to FDA. Wood? Lacey Act form to USDA. Steel? US CBP Steel and Aluminum declaration form. Water products? More Prior Notice to FDA. Before the termination of De Minimis, we just declare them and ship. Now its quite a bit more work especially if shipped with courier. A bit less paperwork with Canada Post per mail regulation. 

All in all, please still expect extra transit and processing time for USA orders. 

Do let me know if you have any questions at all. Thank you all for your support!

1qevevw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1qevevw/weird_interview_process/,Weird interview process,"Interviewed at an 'AI powered commercial insurance brokerage' called Harper Insure for a 'Go-to-Market Growth Lead' that was supposed to be a full day in person with practical case studies. Already talked to new Head of Sales last week (he's been here less than a month). I get to the office and there's no organization at all of who I'm talking to and nobody really has any clear interview structure, just a vague 'tell us about you' and then me asking questions about the company, the product, etc..

Neither of the 2 founders talk to/interview me even though I see both of them in office (less than 25 employees). Funky floral sweatshirt on the CEO and COO is wearing a jean jacket with crazy shirt and CTO has his dogs in office - is this accurate depiction of SF startup culture? Somehow they apparently just raised 35 million in their Series A (is this BS? my background is not in tech sales so idk. They're at 5mil ARR apparently within 18 months).

Job was initially presented as helping build out all these AI automation systems and managing a sales floor apparently ( [ https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/harper/jobs/niC904V-go-to-market-growth-lead ](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/harper/jobs/niC904V-go-to-market-growth-lead) ) , but it's really just high volume transactional sales of super small commercial policies ($2,500-10k premium) from leads they buy of first time insurance buyers. Spent all of 5 mins with the head of sales today, neither of the founders, and a handful of the sales guys (with no insurance background) with no interview structure. I end up being the one running the convo's basically asking a ton of questions.

The COO asks me to go to coffee after, talks about himself a lot and how he 'likes to do hard things' and how 'this is like chewing on glass' and just sooo hard and how it's working from 5am-8pm every day. Then super indirectly says its not a fit, but wouldn't tell me why or what was missing or anything direct. Super vague fluffy language. Impression I got was just 'vibes.' I've worked more transactional sales than this guy, IN INSURANCE, 100% commission based for years, so feedback not really aligned. Also asked if it would 'be too much for me' to go back up into the office to grab my water bottle lol.

I'm not surprised by the misalignment with job posting and the interview process given the size/age of the company, but how would they raise this much money and be so Busch league with their interviewing?",1,1768604981.0,sales,6,0.6,False

These prompts precisely modify existing images. Upload a photo, apply the prompt, and let the model preserve edges, lighting, and realism while making targeted improvements.

3. **Depth of Field Adjustment**
   Keep foreground elements sharply focused while smoothly blurring the background. Use shallow depth of field to highlight the subject without changing the original lighting or color tone.

4. **Cinematic Color Grading**
   Apply a refined cinematic grade with soft teal shadows and warm highlights. Ensure skin tones remain accurate. Add mild contrast for a premium, polished finish.

5. **Lighting Shift (Day → Night)**
   Convert the scene into a believable nighttime setting using moonlit highlights, cool ambient shadows, warm artificial light sources, and subtle reflections to create narrative depth.

6. **Background Bokeh Effect**

4. Explicitly state what must remain unchanged.
5. Refine prompts iteratively instead of restarting from scratch.

basically regular crackers with a light garlic aroma,

Head is kinda fucked not going to lie. I feel so much pressure on me at the minute, particularly to gain weight and get driving. Probably the most I have ever felt. Today I took myself to Belfast to do some shopping, it was a really nice day out. Spent too much money on treats (shown in the final pic, never seen the Lindt before it looks so cool!), but it was nice to get chocolate and actually be able to eat it HOORAY! I also got a descaler for my coffee machine bc it keeps stopping working, so hopefully that will fix it! I was a little annoyed I couldn't manage to buy lunch out and had to bring my own food but then also proud I didn't use this as an excuse to not eat or miss a meal or push out back to a ridiculous time! A few weeks ago I definitely would have done this as eating out by myself was just too much and I was definitely in a worse place. However my sister picked me up from the train and again voiced her concerns over my activity levels and also that she thinks I am maybe struggling more than I am letting on. Which maybe is true in some aspects. because I feel like as soon as I struggled a little I get threatened with hospital and my dads abuse towards me just gets worse and worse. So ofc I am not going to let on I am struggling. But also I am managing, I am trying my best, I am taking it at my own pace. My sister doesn't see the abuse I am subject to, she knows what my dad is like but doesn't see the extent of his abuse.

To make matters worse, tonight dad started to tell me I am a massive drain on both him and my sister. This just makes me feel so fucking low and stupid and worthless, I began to panic I am failing at recovery. I lost all my appetite and honestly just felt like I am doing so shit and honestly would be better off dead because my efforts clearly aren't enough and what's the point anymore. Living in constant anxiety, depression and battling myself so hard :( I am proud I still pushed to have my plan but it just felt utterly shit! 

I am just going to keep going until my appointment on Wednesday- it’s all I can do! I know I need to challenge myself more, I know I need to push boundaries - adding an extra biscuit, adding more cheese, bigger meals and snacks! But I don’t want the narrative in my head I am failing because it sends me into a depression and gets me all paranoid! Anyways, hope you all are well!

I plan on eventually growing strictly ancient fruit and dumping it all into kegs, but its summer right now so i'm growing hops and melons into the mix.  I noticed other people aren't utilizing this many tiles for crops, not to mention I also have a greenhouse that only grows ancient fruit + fruit trees.    
  
I'm also stocking up on a huge supply of coffee beans so I could process it all into coffees for triple shot espressos for future years.    
  
I have a shed full of kegs and another shed full of preserves jars and dehydrators.  I also have about 11 Crystalariums fully producing jade for skull cavern runs.

Am I overlooking something by having this many crops growing at once? Any advice is welcome.",1,1768604561.0,StardewValley,5,1.0,False
