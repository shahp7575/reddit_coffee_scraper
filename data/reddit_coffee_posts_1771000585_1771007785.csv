If you don’t want to default to an overpriced dinner reservation, here’s a tight shortlist of things actually worth leaving the house for:

❤️ **Sweetheart Festival — Downtown Loveland (Saturday)**  
Live music, weddings, heart art installations, downtown energy. If you’ve never done Valentine’s in Loveland, this is the year.

🎶 **LoversFest @ The Aggie (Saturday night)**  
Dance floor, DJs, not subtle, very fun.

🌲 **Winter Walk + Eagle Spotting**  
Bare cottonwoods = better bird watching right now. Fossil Creek, Lake Loveland, Lake Estes — solid winter magic if the sun’s out.

🍷 **Foothills Winter Farmers Market (Saturday morning)**  
Coffee + local makers + easy Valentine’s browsing without the dinner chaos.

(There are plenty of things for all the single folks out there, too!)

That’s just the short list.

Every Tuesday, I send a full Northern Colorado roundup (Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Greeley, Estes, Berthoud, Timnath, Johnstown, Severance, Fort Lupton, etc.) for free.

It’s basically for people who don’t want to scroll 20 different sites and would rather get one thoughtful mix of local history, trail ideas, small business gems, and the best things happening across the region.

I used to do protein everything. Fairlife Shakes, Barebells bars, protein Ninja Creami's as fillers either with my meals or between them. I was having some stomach problems and as a part of cutting out food and drinks I felt were bad for my gut (spicy anything, onions, garlic, alcohol, coffee, etc.) I cut out anything with fake sugar. Which all of these high protein things seem to have. My diet still consists of some processed foods but nothing with the fake sugar and loaded with whey protein and I honestly feel way better and no longer feel like I am constantly clamoring for food which seems like it should be the opposite. I'm eating less protein, same amount of calories, just some extra rice with my lunch or extra veggies and potatoes with my dinner.

I purchased Starbucks Frappuccino syrup and Starbucks, Frappuccino espresso roast blend soluble coffee powder from eBay for probably the last five or six years.

When I went online to eBay in January to replenish my supplies, suddenly I couldn’t find any Starbucks ingredients on eBay at all. The only place I could find any of them was on a website called DIY barista.

I haven’t seen anything on any sub credits or online anywhere saying that Starbucks has put a stop to employees selling their ingredients on eBay or about eBay for bidding the sale of their ingredients on their site.

1r3x2e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1r3x2e1/i_configured_ats_systems_for_years_heres_the_part/,I configured ATS systems for years. Here’s the part nobody in HR will tell you,"I spent several years working with ATS from the inside. Here’s what nobody tells you.

Most resume advice is written by people who read about ATS. I actually worked with these systems - configured them, tested them, watched what they do to specific files. Saw where good candidates literally disappear from the pipeline.

It’s like watching a good movie get removed from a platform because of a technical error. Frustrating, and a little embarrassing when you realize you’re part of that machine.

Myth #1: ATS automatically rejects 75% of resumes

This is not true - and it’s harmful because it sends people in the wrong direction.

I personally talked to dozens of recruiters while working in this space. Almost all of them said the same thing: the system doesn’t auto-reject. ATS is basically a large database with filters. Not a robot bouncer. Although some systems I worked with were so broken, bouncer wasn’t even close - more like a bouncer who lost his own ID.

But here’s what actually happens: a poorly formatted resume doesn’t get rejected - it just sinks so low in the stack that no human ever reaches it. The difference is subtle but critical. You weren’t thrown out - you were just never seen. Kind of like sending a resume by fax in 2025.

Myth #2: Stuff it with keywords and you’ll get through

The most common misconception I saw - that ATS simply counts word matches. That’s exactly what creates keyword stuffing. And that’s exactly what now works against you.

Modern systems started recognizing unnatural language patterns. When I tested documents with obvious stuffing - they ranked worse than clean, well written texts with fewer keyword matches. One document I saw had the word Python in it 14 times. The guy clearly wasn’t applying to a reptile zoo, but the system still knocked him out.

What actually works: keywords in high-visibility zones carry more weight. The summary and job title are the first things the system reads. If there’s a match with the job posting there - you’re already in a different league.

What actually decides the outcome

Once the file passes parsing - the human stage begins. And this is where it gets harsher than most people expect.

The average recruiter manages 15-20 open positions simultaneously. Each one gets hundreds of resumes. They literally have no time to read. They scan. If you have a recruiter friend - buy them coffee. They’ve earned it.

Average time for a first glance - around 10-12 seconds. This isn’t a metaphor, it’s what physically happens. And most of that time the eyes travel down the left edge of the document - across the first few words of each line.

Practical takeaway: everything important needs to be at the start of the bullet. Not in the middle, not at the end. At the start. Yes, right where you usually put something like responsible for coordinating cross-functional stakeholder engagement within the framework of strategic initiatives.

Specific things I saw work in practice

First - job title. If the posting asks for Product Manager and you have Product Owner / Manager - that can already blur the match. Take the exact phrase from the JD and use it. Not a synonym, not a paraphrase - the exact phrase. The system won’t appreciate your creativity. It won’t appreciate anything actually, it has no feelings, I checked.

Second - certifications. Resumes with relevant certifications perform noticeably better. But only when formatted correctly: full name, year, organization. AWS cert is garbage for a parser. AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, 2023, Amazon Web Services is data. The difference is roughly like saying I know finance vs CFA, Level II, 2022.

Third - numbers. Resumes with specific metrics get interview invitations significantly more often. This isn’t advice - it’s a pattern I saw over and over again. Increased conversion and increased conversion from 2.1% to 3.8% in one quarter are two completely different documents in the eyes of both the system and the human behind it. If you don’t have numbers - make them up… no, kidding. Find them. They’re always there, you just never tracked them.

Fourth - timing. When a posting gets too many applications - it either gets closed or recruiters start prioritizing early applicants. The first 48 hours after a job goes live isn’t just a good idea. It genuinely affects your chances. Set up LinkedIn alerts and move fast. Yes, right now. Yes, even if you’re reading this at 11pm.

And yes - if you read this far, you already have more patience than half the recruiters I know.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1771007448.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False
1r3x2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumeWizard/comments/1r3x2d2/how_real_conversations_unlock_hidden_job/,How Real Conversations Unlock Hidden Job Opportunities,"I have seen it over and over in resume review meetings. The person with the perfect skills and a well-tailored CV gets quietly passed over, while someone with a less obvious fit lands an interview. I know it’s not always the case, however, I can’t deny it doesn't happen.

A surprising number of jobs just never make it to public job boards. I remember reviewing a stack of applications for a software role, only to find out later the team had already set their sights on someone who had worked with a friend of the hiring manager. That candidate still submitted a CV, but the real introduction happened over coffee.

It is not about having connections in some exclusive club. The folks who find these hidden openings are usually the ones who put themselves out there when they do not have to. Someone who reached out to a previous colleague for coffee, or dropped a thoughtful message to a hiring manager about a recent product launch. Not to ask for a job, but to genuinely talk shop.

When I think about the people who consistently ended up in final rounds, a lot of them had stories like this. They heard about a team expanding through a Slack group, or got a heads-up from someone they met at a meetup months ago. Sometimes it was as simple as responding to someone’s LinkedIn post with a smart question, which led to a chat, which led to an introduction.

A lot of candidates gloss over this because networking sounds awkward or inauthentic. I used to feel the same. But in practice, most hiring managers are just looking for someone who feels like a real person, not a faceless application. I have seen senior engineers and mid-career folks both land roles this way, often bypassing the black hole of online applications entirely.

One thing I have learned: you do not have to be the loudest or the most connected. You just have to be willing to have a few real conversations. The jobs you want are often hiding in those quiet corners, where people are talking about projects, not job postings.

If you are burned out by online applications and endless rejections, it is not just you. Behind the scenes, most teams make their decisions long before the posting even goes live. Small, genuine interactions often open doors that a perfect resume never will.

So if you are feeling stuck, maybe try shifting your focus from polishing the CV just a little more, to reaching out to someone whose work you actually find interesting. No need for a pitch. Just curiosity and a willingness to connect. That is where I have seen the hidden opportunities show up, again and again.",1,1771007446.0,ResumeWizard,0,1.0,False

* A&W: A&W is my favorite fast food restaurant ever. If I was dying on death row and they said, ""You have one more meal,"" that meal would be a Papa Burger combo with an extra-large root beer and probably one of those medium polar swirls.
* Culver's: Culver's is right up there with A&W neck and neck. That's King Kong versus Godzilla right there.
* Texas Roadhouse: This place bangs. Don't even get me started on the fucking bread either. For like $16 I can go get a steak, a loaded baked potato, and then either a Caesar salad or a cup of delicious chili.
* Popeye's: They have the best spicy chicken sandwich in the world right now on the planet.
* Jersey Mike's: This is my sub shop next to Potbelly. Jersey Mike's, so fresh, so delicious, you got to get the vinegar and oil on it, I could eat it every day.
* Potbelly: Jersey Mike's and Potbelly is 1A and 1B for me.
* Chick-fil-A: Can never go wrong with CFA. Spicy chicken with pepper jack is the way.=, not to mention their mac & cheese. They are a tad overrated though from what I've heard. Is it worth making your entire personality revolving around eating it fucking four times a week? No.

# Very Good

* Arby's: Thing about Arby's is you can't strafe away from the basics there, you got to go and just get the sliders. If you get a Buffalo chicken slider or a hot beef slider that shit is very good.
* Dairy Queen: I honestly love Dairy Queen's food, their flamethrower burger, their double bacon cheeseburger, their chicken strips with the white gravy and the toast. The Blizzard, specifically the S'mores Blizzard. Very underrated.
* Taco Bell: It's not quite elite but it's also very good. Trust me, the crunchy spicy potato taco, you're going to have a phenomenal meal. That potato taco is low-key the best thing on the menu, trust me, the sauce is one-of-a-kind.
* McDonald's: The fries, their burgers, their breakfast sandwiches are all top tier, I do agree they're getting a little bit expensive now but I love the Golden Arcs.
* Auntie Anne's: Very good because I love pretzels. A hot salty pretzel with some cheese sauce, are you kidding me?
* Shake Shack: I had it once and I thought it was actually quite good. Burgers were greasy and I still remember them being tasty.
* Checkers: I had it once and it was outstanding. All I remember about it is the burger that they gave you weighed about 10 fucking pounds and their fries are deliciously seasoned.
* Cinnabon: If you don't like delicious little cinnamon pillows filled with cream, get the fuck out.
* Domino's: When you're in the mood for Domino's, that shit is great, and also that 2 for $6.99 deal, you're not beating that anywhere else.
* Five Guys: Horribly overpriced. The burger was absolutely delicious. You HAVE to get your fries well-done. HAVE to.
* Papa John's: Papa John's is great. One of if not the best pizza chains out there.
* Krispy Kreme: I love Krispy Kreme, just a glazed doughnut, can't even describe to you how heavenly it is.
* Chipotle: I could eat Chipotle every day of my life if I had to. The problem with Chipotle is the quantity, they fuck you, especially if you Door Dash, they fuck you.

# Nickelback

* Burger King: Forcefully hated. People love to hate it for absolutely no reason, Burger King is actually pretty good.
* Subway: Subway gets a lot of shit. Yes, their prices have become stupid but I'm always satisfied after I eat a Subway sandwich. It's good, it fills you up. For some reason they have the best mayonnaise too, I don't know why.
* White Castle: People act like this place is inconsumable when in reality it's just an acquired taste. If you like onion and you get a fresh White Castle burger you are going to have a blast. This place is a lot like Arby's, just don't venture away from the basics.
* Olive Garden: Olive Garden is like a meme restaurant to some people. I get it's a chain, but it's good and their chicken dumpling soup, holy shit so good.
* KFC: People act like it's trash food, the fuck it is. A bucket of their fried chicken fresh is almost impossible to beat and they have a delicious peach Mountain Dew there.

# Decent, But Nothing Special

* Baskin-Robbins: Decent but nothing special, it's ice cream.
* Panda Express: I mean, it's chicken and rice, it's okay.
* Hooters: I have eaten at a Hooters before, it was decent. If you're going to Hooters as a 21-year-old or older, I'm going to be honest, the food is pretty irrelevant.
* Crumbl Cookies: Decent. The cookies are good but the problem I have with them is the cookies weigh about 15 fucking pounds per cookie so I have to eat them in like quarters.
* TGI Fridays: Decent, I mean it's a fucking TGI Fridays like what do you expect.
* Pizza Hut: This place is weird because everything there is good except the pizza. It's fucking crazy.
* Sonic: I would say painfully overrated but the hype has really died down. Went there once and got a burger, it was an ordinary burger.
* Firehouse Subs: A decent sub sandwich except the portion they give you is like if you were a fucking first grader. Never ever full after Firehouse in my experience.
* Red Robin: Decent, fries are okay, burgers are fine.
* Dunkin': Decent, I just had a cup of coffee, I mean, it was a cup of coffee.
* Starbucks: It's coffee.
* Wendy's: I'll have it and I'm like ""This is really good"" most of the time, but sometimes I'll have it and I'm disappointed. I also think you need a leaf blower to get all the salt off the fries and their prices are getting absurd along with their food getting smaller.
* Nathan's Hot Dogs: Decent, had it in the airport, it was just an ordinary hot dog and fries.
* Hardee's: Their burgers were fine but half the time I got them there was so much sauce on them that my hands would be just destroyed by the second bite.
* Red Lobster: Decent, I think they're carried by their biscuits.
* Denny's: Decent, pretty good for breakfast food. Kind of hard to fuck up bacon and eggs though and if you do you should be in jail.
* Panera: One of my favorite cups of mac and cheese on the planet. Their soup in the bread bowl is delicious, their sandwich is scrumptious, the side of bread you get with the butter. Sad how overpriced and lower quality they've become though. Everything else on their menu is hospital food.
* Long John Silver's: When you eat fresh caught fish forever (me) and then you go somewhere like Long John Silvers and get fast food fish, it's not even the same meal. Not bad though.
* Whataburger: It can be really really good, but it heavily depends on location. Some locations are night and day different. Gotta eat at the one in Texas. Need to get the honey butter chicken biscuit too.

# Overrated

* Cold Stone: Is it good ice cream? Yes it is. But if I blindfolded you and threw Dairy Queen and Cold Stone in front of you and they had the same consistency, you would not tell the difference. Also pretty expensive.
* In-N-Out: Painfully overrated and I mean painfully. People act like if you go to a state or a city that has an In-N-Out you have to go there like it is just the biggest gem. I think you have to go there to see how average it is, it's a fucking burger and fries.
* Jimmy John's: Talk about never being full, similar to Firehouse but worse.

# Tolerable

* Buffalo Wild Wings: Tolerable at this point. BWW has probably had the most consistent downfall out of any restaurant I have ever seen. They do not listen to people at all. Wings have gotten smaller, sauce has gotten less, service has gotten slower, the place is just really not that great anymore and they're just overpriced.
* Chuck E. Cheese: Tolerable. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't find it special and I thought their crust was kind of gross.
* Dave & Buster's: I had it one time and I thought it tasted like I was eating at a gas station which, I mean, you can tolerate gas station food, but you don't want to go back.

* Little Caesars: Little Caesars is ass, I'm sorry. The last couple times I've had it it has been atrocious. Imagine choking that down after a rough day.
* Cici’s Pizza: I can still remember this being the worst pizza I've ever eaten. It was like a buffet but all the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours, it was shit.
* Applebee's: Applebee's tastes like microwaved garbage trash from my experience, it's horrible. If you actually go there and try to have an enjoyable meal, the service is also like the most garbage thing ever.

**11:00 am podcast start time:** make my bed, check cats food bowl and water bowl, fill my water and coffee and move to the couch (dont worry you have time to do this they are always late)

**goof and gaffs**: stretch, take my meds, and laugh because sometimes laughter does heal.

**ad break**: brush my teeth and do a chore (take out the trash or do the dishes)

**every time ethan coughs:** drink some water or stretch my legs (depending on how much he coughs that day)

**every time dan shuts down ethan:** i add an “on the moment” type activity: check the mail, clean the litter box, make a snack, etc.

**every time ethan doest hear ab**: i have to do sit ups or squats, ihml. i made this ine hard cause hes been better.

**first segment**: do some yoga. if thats too much for the day, time to pull out the weighted blanket and pull up the cat and heal through the podcast good energy.

**second segment:** skin care! wash my face, do my serums and mask etc. i may be depressed but hila inspires me to make sure i look good doing it!

**special segment days**: (time to roar, crying on command (eel pit), etc): challenge yourself day, squats during segment, journal, clean your room/living room, just the surrounding areas deep clean it.

**harley and gwam**: gym or epson salt soak (i suffer from fibromyalgia so it just depends on my joints and old man aches that day)

PLEASE ADD YOUR HACKS THAT HELP YOU! i really hope this reaches even one person in the audience. this fandom has always felt so open and made me feel so happy. the podcast fills my days with laughs and helps the depression x10. thank you all so much for being an amazing group of people.",2,1771007280.0,h3h3productions,1,1.0,False

If you don’t want to default to an overpriced dinner reservation, here’s a tight shortlist of things actually worth leaving the house for:

❤️ **Sweetheart Festival — Downtown Loveland (Saturday)**  
Live music, weddings, heart art installations, downtown energy. If you’ve never done Valentine’s in Loveland, this is the year.

🎶 **LoversFest @ The Aggie (Saturday night)**  
Dance floor, DJs, not subtle, very fun.

🌲 **Winter Walk + Eagle Spotting**  
Bare cottonwoods = better bird watching right now. Fossil Creek, Lake Loveland, Lake Estes — solid winter magic if the sun’s out.

🍷 **Foothills Winter Farmers Market (Saturday morning)**  
Coffee + local makers + easy Valentine’s browsing without the dinner chaos.  
  
(There are plenty of things for all the single folks out there, too!)

That’s just the short list.

Every Tuesday, I send a full Northern Colorado roundup (Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Greeley, Estes, Berthoud, Timnath, Johnstown, Severance, Fort Lupton, etc.) for free.

It’s basically for people who don’t want to scroll 20 different sites and would rather get one thoughtful mix of local history, trail ideas, small business gems, and the best things happening across the region.

1r3wyu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1r3wyu7/fast_food_tier_list111/,Fast Food Tier List1!1!!1,"# Elite

* A&W: A&W is my favorite fast food restaurant ever. If I was dying on death row and they said, ""You have one more meal,"" that meal would be a Papa Burger combo with an extra-large root beer and probably one of those medium polar swirls.
* Culver's: Culver's is right up there with A&W neck and neck. That's King Kong versus Godzilla right there.
* Texas Roadhouse: This place bangs. Don't even get me started on the fucking bread either. For like $16 I can go get a steak, a loaded baked potato, and then either a Caesar salad or a cup of delicious chili.
* Popeye's: They have the best spicy chicken sandwich in the world right now on the planet.
* Jersey Mike's: This is my sub shop next to Potbelly. Jersey Mike's, so fresh, so delicious, you got to get the vinegar and oil on it, I could eat it every day.
* Potbelly: Jersey Mike's and Potbelly is 1A and 1B for me.
* Chick-fil-A: Can never go wrong with CFA. Spicy chicken with pepper jack is the way.=, not to mention their mac & cheese. They are a tad overrated though from what I've heard. Is it worth making your entire personality revolving around eating it fucking four times a week? No.

# Very Good

* Arby's: Thing about Arby's is you can't strafe away from the basics there, you got to go and just get the sliders. If you get a Buffalo chicken slider or a hot beef slider that shit is very good.
* Dairy Queen: I honestly love Dairy Queen's food, their flamethrower burger, their double bacon cheeseburger, their chicken strips with the white gravy and the toast. The Blizzard, specifically the S'mores Blizzard. Very underrated.
* Taco Bell: It's not quite elite but it's also very good. Trust me, the crunchy spicy potato taco, you're going to have a phenomenal meal. That potato taco is low-key the best thing on the menu, trust me, the sauce is one-of-a-kind.
* McDonald's: The fries, their burgers, their breakfast sandwiches are all top tier, I do agree they're getting a little bit expensive now but I love the Golden Arcs.
* Auntie Anne's: Very good because I love pretzels. A hot salty pretzel with some cheese sauce, are you kidding me?
* Shake Shack: I had it once and I thought it was actually quite good. Burgers were greasy and I still remember them being tasty.
* Checkers: I had it once and it was outstanding. All I remember about it is the burger that they gave you weighed about 10 fucking pounds and their fries are deliciously seasoned.
* Cinnabon: If you don't like delicious little cinnamon pillows filled with cream, get the fuck out.
* Domino's: When you're in the mood for Domino's, that shit is great, and also that 2 for $6.99 deal, you're not beating that anywhere else.
* Five Guys: Horribly overpriced. The burger was absolutely delicious. You HAVE to get your fries well-done. HAVE to.
* Papa John's: Papa John's is great. One of if not the best pizza chains out there.
* Krispy Kreme: I love Krispy Kreme, just a glazed doughnut, can't even describe to you how heavenly it is.
* Chipotle: I could eat Chipotle every day of my life if I had to. The problem with Chipotle is the quantity, they fuck you, especially if you Door Dash, they fuck you.

# Nickelback

* Burger King: Forcefully hated. People love to hate it for absolutely no reason, Burger King is actually pretty good.
* Subway: Subway gets a lot of shit. Yes, their prices have become stupid but I'm always satisfied after I eat a Subway sandwich. It's good, it fills you up. For some reason they have the best mayonnaise too, I don't know why.
* White Castle: People act like this place is inconsumable when in reality it's just an acquired taste. If you like onion and you get a fresh White Castle burger you are going to have a blast. This place is a lot like Arby's, just don't venture away from the basics.
* Olive Garden: Olive Garden is like a meme restaurant to some people. I get it's a chain but like it's good and their chicken dumpling soup, holy shit so good.
* KFC: People act like it's trash food, the fuck it is. A bucket of their fried chicken fresh is almost impossible to beat and they have a delicious peach Mountain Dew there.

# Decent, But Nothing Special

* Baskin-Robbins: Decent but nothing special, it's ice cream.
* Panda Express: I mean, it's chicken and rice, it's okay.
* Hooters: I have eaten at a Hooters before, it was decent. If you're going to Hooters as a 21-year-old or older, I'm going to be honest, the food is pretty irrelevant.
* Crumbl Cookies: Decent. The cookies are good but the problem I have with them is the cookies weigh about 15 fucking pounds per cookie so I have to eat them in like quarters.
* TGI Fridays: Decent, I mean it's a fucking TGI Fridays like what do you expect.
* Pizza Hut: This place is weird because everything there is good except the pizza. It's fucking crazy.
* Sonic: I would say painfully overrated but the hype has really died down. Went there once and got a burger, it was an ordinary burger.
* Firehouse Subs: A decent sub sandwich except the portion they give you is like if you were a fucking first grader. Never ever full after Firehouse in my experience.
* Red Robin: Decent, fries are okay, burgers are fine.
* Dunkin': Decent, I just had a cup of coffee, I mean, it was a cup of coffee.
* Starbucks: It's coffee.
* Wendy's: I'll have it and I'm like ""This is really good"" most of the time, but sometimes I'll have it and I'm disappointed. I also think you need a leaf blower to get all the salt off the fries and their prices are getting absurd along with their food getting smaller.
* Nathan's Hot Dogs: Decent, had it in the airport, it was just an ordinary hot dog and fries.
* Hardee's: Their burgers were fine but half the time I got them there was so much sauce on them that my hands would be just destroyed by the second bite.
* Red Lobster: Decent, I think they're carried by their biscuits.
* Denny's: Decent, pretty good for breakfast food. Kind of hard to fuck up bacon and eggs though and if you do you should be in jail.
* Panera: One of my favorite cups of mac and cheese on the planet. Their soup in the bread bowl is delicious, their sandwich is scrumptious, the side of bread you get with the butter. Sad how overpriced and lower quality they've become though. Everything else on their menu is hospital food.
* Long John Silver's: When you eat fresh caught fish forever (me) and then you go somewhere like Long John Silvers and get fast food fish, it's not even the same meal. Not bad though.

1r3wy3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1r3wy3q/pineward_x_boyfriend_reviews/,Pineward x Boyfriend reviews,"Good morning IMAM! I got my (non-scent-wearing but vaguely supportive) boyfriend a bunch of Pineward samples for Christmas. After giving them a good long rest, we tested them all together. We had a ton of fun with the process and we found several that we both really enjoy, and a few that he wants to upsize once he finishes his samples.

A little bit about us: I am late 30s, outdoorsy, and would live at the beach if you let me. My personal style is leans sporty/surfer/beach bum/90s kid, but my perfume taste is gourmand all day all the time. He is mid 30s, also very outdoorsy, loves working on old cars and building art out of old junk and stuff he finds on the side of the highway. His personal style is boardshorts + whatever t shirts he can find at goodwill, that he will wear until they are literally rags (unless we are going out to dinner, and then he loves to wear fancy dress shirts, crisp denim, and leather boots). He does not have a perfume preference beyond ""that smells good"" or ""mmmm is that vanilla?"" 

We tested the samples on the insides of our forearms, and for the most part did not notice huge differences in the way they smelled on him vs on me. I noted the few that were different below. I asked him for his thoughts first and wrote down his hilarious stream of consciousness interpretations, then I gave him my thoughts, and finally I read the notes aloud.

On to the reviews!

**Acadian -** 

My thoughts: This smells aquatic. I'm getting seaweed, and something that is maybe sea buckthorn? This scent definitely leans traditionally masc, but not super blue. Well balanced and interesting. As it dries down it smells more like a fancy men's shaving cream or deodorant.

His thoughts: This smells like Irish Spring deodorant that was adopted by pine trees and doesn't know it's supposed to be soap. Also it tastes like soap (he did not taste it, idk where this came from lol). There is something inter-tidal about it. (After 10 min) Oh that's better, now it smells like sterile beach house. I taste this one so much every time I smell it. It smells better than it tastes.

Notes: *sweet yuzu, bergamot, juniper berry, ivy, eucalyptus, waterlily, goldenrod, heliotrope, seaweed, cedar, oakmoss*

**Coastal Veil -** 

My thoughts: Smells a little like Acadian. (After 10 minutes) Oh no.....I smell poop. I'm not sure why my nose is doing this to me but this one smells like fresh horse manure. 

His thoughts: We are in a 90s commercial for soap. It smells like Irish Spring, or like generic deodorant. Like the average genre of men's bath care. (After hearing my thoughts) You're right, it does smell like manure! Like a horse that ate a bunch of pinecones.

Notes: *juniper berries, juniper needles, sea water, bladderwrack, coastal cypress, oyster mushroom, water pepper, blue gum eucalyptus, pacific ambergris\*, Irish sea moss, sandalwood*

**Cotswold -** 

My thoughts: I get sawdust, pine (fresh cut green pine to be exact), smoke, and dirt.

His thoughts: This just smells like really fresh pine, like you're actively sawing a pine tree with a dull saw. There's some really dark pitch, and yeah some dirt too. Volcanic dirt, pitch, and someone's unseasoned woodpile.

Notes: *cedar, smoke, oakwood, ponderosa pine needles, vanilla*

**Gingerbread -** 

My thoughts: From far away it smells like sweet molasses cookies or soft fresh-baked gingerbread. Up close I smell ginger, clove, and cinnamon. As this settles it veers more into chai spice territory from close up, but from further away I'm still getting gingerbread. I smell all the spices on boyfriend too, but he amps the clove way more than me. After 15 minutes on the skin it gets sweeter again, and the molasses and brown sugar come forward more. I don't distinctly smell milk, vanilla, or icing, but they add to the general fresh baked cookie vibe. 

His thoughts: As advertised. That is gingerbread. Smelling up close that's really nice! There's some citrus in there and some pine as well (not sure what he was smelling, maybe the cloves and ginger?)

Notes: *ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, wheat absolute, butter CO2, molasses distillate, brown sugar, walnut, milk, cream, vanilla*

**Greymist -** 

My thoughts: Smells like Christmas trees! Sweet and piney, like doug fir or noble fir when you crush the leaves. Not sappy or resinous really, and not a dry or a cut wood smell. This is fir needles all the way. There's something really fresh about this one, but it also feels very comforting and cozy at the same time. Almost like the smell of fresh air blowing through a cold doug fir forest. Also....a touch of berries maybe? Not sure which ones, maybe raspberry. After checking the notes I believe I'm smelling the citron. There's also a faint hint of earthiness in the background, like freshly turned soil in the understory of a fir forest. I think this might be the tobacco peeking through. 

His thoughts: I know that smell! There's something conifer, cypress maybe? It smells like what my uncle's room would have smelled like if he was cool.

Notes: *noble fir, scotch pine, expressed citron, blond tobacco, botanical musk, vetiver*

**Gristmill -** 

My thoughts: I smell dry cedar, sawdust, and something that kind of smells like machine oil. This one smelled a little sharper on me, maybe more piney? On him it smelled drier and heavier on the cedar and sawdust. Beast mode projection--I was still able to smell this on skin a day later even after many hand washings and a shower.

His thoughts: Smells like a sawmill. Definitely cedar and sawdust.

Notes: *Cedar planks, sawdust, smoldering logs, edelwood oil, amber, black walnut, mahogany, labdanum*

**Snoqualmie -** 

My thoughts: Smells a little sweet, sappy, resinous, and kind of musky. To me this smells like weed. Not dried weed or burning weed, but weed that is still growing on the plant. Not as sweet on me as on him. Intimate projection and not a ton of longevity. After 20 minutes on the skin it gets less weed-y and more foresty to me. Now it smells like freshly crushed noble fir needles, and I'm also getting some cedar. 

His thoughts: This smells like musky lichen. No wait, it smells like weed. Like if berries grew on weed plants. Musky berries. (After checking notes) Ahhh it's the tamarack and larch I'm smelling. It smells like the dark part of the woods.

Notes: *douglas fir, balsam fir, red cedar, larch, tamarack, sandarac resin*

**Tome -** 

My thoughts: This is predominantly leather, with something floral in the background. And maybe a little vanilla? Mostly leather though.

His thoughts: Hmmm.....that's pleasant and old lady-ish? It smells round. No sharp corners on this one, it's like a round room with furniture and doilies and shit and everything is the same shade of not-quite-white. It's like a 90myear old bob haircut. You know the song Grandma's Hands? Yeah, that's what this smells like.

Notes: *Parchment (nagarmotha), leather, sandalwood, cedar, Jade 403 (binding glue), vintage book accord, orris root, black tea, coffee, rice paper, ambrette, oakmoss, tobacco*

Subject: \[EXTERNAL\] Incident near DePaul University

 

I want to update you on a deeply upsetting incident that occurred yesterday at Olive & Oak, a coffee shop next to DePaul's campus.

 

Hillel and JUF staff were running coffee hours for students to come by and chat, grab a cup of coffee, and spend time together. 12 Jewish students from DePaul, Loyola, and Roosevelt were there. The gathering was publicized on Hillel social media. Hillel staff and students had been enjoying Olive & Oak for weeks without incident.

 

As the Jewish students started to arrive, other students wearing keffiyehs and sweatshirts with invectives like “globalize the intifada” began streaming in. They began talking loudly about antisemitic tropes related to Israel and allegations that Israel is committing war crimes. 

 

The disrupting students asked the cafe to start playing Palestinian music loudly and then started dancing while chanting “Free Palestine, Free Palestine.”  The JUF staff member went outside to make a security call, and on her way back in one of the agitating students deliberately shoulder-checked her. Several of the anti-Jewish students were recognized to be members of DePaul's SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine). They asked the Olive & Oak staff, “Hey, so can we kick them out?” and continued shouting “Free Palestine” at the Jewish students while being cheered on by Olive & Oak staff.

 

The Jewish students were understandably upset and got up to leave the cafe. As they were walking out, the aggressors and Olive & Oak’s staff and owner chanted “we won”, while filming and photographing the Jewish group walking out. 

 

Hillel students - especially those who experienced the encampments first-hand - were deeply disturbed, and Hillel staff sat with them afterward to process what happened. 

 

Said one student leader, “This is just one more place I’ve been excluded from since I started college. I can’t be in social clubs, I can’t be in Greek life, and now I can’t go to a local cafe simply because I’m Jewish.”

 

The behavior of the SJP students and the Olive & Oak staff is completely unacceptable. Jews should be able to gather, chat, and build community without fear of harassment or intimidation.",0,1771007096.0,WindyCity,0,0.5,False

What I found kinda blew my mind, most of us are walking around basically blind to what's really happening in conversations.

The thing is, we're all picking up on maybe 30% of what someone's actually communicating. The rest? Flying right over our heads while we're busy thinking about what to say next or checking if we have food in our teeth. I used to think I was decent at reading people until I started studying this stuff from legit sources like Joe Navarro's work (ex-FBI guy who literally wrote the book on body language), research from Paul Ekman (the dude who mapped out microexpressions), and honestly some fascinating podcasts like Hidden Brain that break down the science of human behavior.

Here's what actually works when you want to read between the lines:

**1. Watch the feet, forget the face**

This sounds weird but feet don't lie. Someone's face might be smiling at you during a conversation but if their feet are pointed toward the door or away from you, they mentally checked out 5 minutes ago. Joe Navarro's ""What Every Body is Saying"" goes deep on this, the guy spent 25 years catching spies by watching their feet. Insanely good read if you want to understand how our lower body reveals true intentions way before our upper body does. 

When someone's genuinely interested, their entire body orients toward you, feet included. If you're talking to someone and they keep angling away, even subtly, that's your cue to wrap it up or change topics.

**2. Notice the micro stuff happening around the eyes**

Real smiles involve the whole eye area crinkling up, fake ones just move the mouth. This is called the Duchenne smile and it's basically impossible to fake convincingly. But here's the cooler part, when someone's pupils dilate slightly during conversation, they're genuinely interested in what you're saying or attracted to you. When they constrict, they're either uncomfortable or disagree with something.

Also pay attention to blink rate. Normal is like 15-20 times per minute but when someone's stressed or lying that number shoots up. During relaxed genuine conversation it actually decreases.

**3. Listen for voice pitch changes mid-sentence**

Most people focus on WHAT is said but HOW it's said reveals everything. When someone's voice suddenly goes up in pitch at the end of a sentence that should be a statement, they're actually unsure about what they just said or seeking approval. 

Conversely, when someone's voice drops lower and gets slower, they're either trying to establish dominance or they're extremely confident about their point. The podcast ""The Science of Success"" had this fascinating episode about vocal tonality and persuasion that changed how I listen to people completely.

**4. Track the timing of reactions**

Genuine emotional reactions happen FAST, like within half a second. If someone hears surprising news and their shocked expression comes after a delay, even just one full second, it's probably performed. Same with laughter, real laughs are involuntary and immediate.

This applies to agreement too. If you say something and there's a pause before someone nods or says yes, they're either unsure or don't actually agree but feel socially pressured to. True agreement is basically instant.

If you want to go even deeper on understanding social dynamics and behavioral psychology but don't have time to read through dense academic papers or multiple books, there's actually a personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's built by AI researchers from Google and pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create audio learning tailored to exactly what you want to improve. You can type something specific like ""become better at reading body language in professional settings"" and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts you can listen to during your commute. The depth is fully adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It includes content from books like the ones mentioned here plus tons of behavioral science research, all fact-checked and synthesized into something actually digestible.

**5. Notice pacifying behaviors under stress**

When people feel uncomfortable or threatened (even just socially), they unconsciously do little things to calm themselves down. Touching their neck, rubbing their arms, playing with jewelry, adjusting their collar. These are called ""pacifying behaviors"" and they spike during moments of stress or when someone just told a lie.

Women often touch their suprasternal notch (that little dip at the base of the throat) when anxious. Men often touch the back of their neck. Both genders will increase face-touching and self-soothing gestures when uncomfortable.

**6. Watch for blocking behaviors**

Crossed arms isn't always defensive but it IS a barrier. More subtle blocking includes someone suddenly placing an object between you and them (their phone, a cup, a menu), or if they're sitting, angling their torso slightly away while keeping their head facing you.

The book ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down with actual percentages and studies. It's not some pop psychology BS, they reference actual peer-reviewed research on territorial behavior and personal space dynamics.

**7. Catch the incongruence between channels**

This is probably the most powerful one. When someone's words, tone, and body language don't match up, ALWAYS trust the body language. If someone says ""I'm fine"" but their shoulders are slumped, voice is flat, and they won't make eye contact, they're obviously not fine.

Our verbal communication evolved way after our nonverbal cues, so the body is actually more honest because it's operating on older, more automatic systems. We can control our words pretty easily but controlling our entire physical presence requires conscious effort most people can't maintain.

**8. Notice baseline shifts**

This is the pro move. You can't interpret any signal without knowing someone's baseline behavior first. Some people are naturally fidgety, some maintain intense eye contact normally, some are just awkward.

Spend the first few minutes of any interaction just observing their normal patterns. THEN watch for deviations. If someone who's been animated suddenly goes still, or someone who's been reserved suddenly gets chatty, that shift means something significant just happened internally.

**9. Pay attention to proximity changes**

When someone likes you or agrees with you, they'll unconsciously lean in or decrease distance. When they're uncomfortable or disagree, they'll lean back or create more space. This happens in tiny increments, like inches, but it's consistent.

Also notice if someone mirrors your movements after a slight delay, that's a sign of rapport and connection. If they're doing the opposite of your movements (you lean in, they lean back), there's tension or disagreement happening below the surface.

**10. Watch the hands for emphasis patterns**

Liars and people who are unsure tend to keep their hands closer to their body or hidden. Confident honest people use bigger hand gestures that are open and expansive. But here's the key, watch WHEN the hands move.

If someone makes a claim and their hands gesture AFTER their words, like an afterthought, they're probably manufacturing the emotion or emphasis. When hands and words are synchronized naturally, that's genuine. This tiny timing difference is hard to fake.

Reality is, most of social interaction is happening beneath the surface level of actual words. We're constantly broadcasting our true feelings and intentions through dozens of micro-signals every minute but most people are too caught up in their own heads to notice.

The good news? Once you start paying attention to even a few of these signals, you'll immediately level up your ability to navigate social situations, avoid awkward moments, and actually connect with people on a deeper level. You'll know when to push forward in a conversation and when to back off. You'll catch lies before they spiral. You'll understand what people actually need vs what they're saying they need.

Start with just one or two signals and practice noticing them consistently. Your brain will start picking up on patterns automatically after a while, it becomes second nature. Then add more signals to your awareness gradually.

The goal isn't to become some manipulative mind reader, it's just to actually SEE what's already happening right in front of you that everyone else is missing. Game changer for literally every relationship in your life.",1,1771006892.0,TheMindSpace,0,1.0,False

1r3wsn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1r3wsn2/adps_wonderful_business_model/,ADP's Wonderful Business Model,"This is my first post. All research was done on my own. I used Gemini & GPT to help fact-check and improve writing clarity after my first-draft. I'm looking for other insights the community might have into ADP.

**Overview:**

Been around for 75 years, they handle payroll and HR for most of America. 1 in 6 Americans are paid through ADP, 80% of the Fortune 500 are clients. They specialize in mid-mega companies.

**How they make money:**

Companies pay A PEPM (Per Employee Per Month) subscription fee to use ADP. This means that a business pays a flat-rate fee plus a fee per employee per month. This scales to massive companies as their headcount increases. Employer Services accounts for 67% of their revenue. 

ADP also makes the rest of its revenue through PEO Services (Professional Employer Organization). A company can sign up for this and effectively hand off all payroll, taxes, compliance, and employee benefits to ADP. ADP becomes the “Employer of Record”. Small and mid-sized businesses use this PEO service for the pooling effect. Essentially, a small firm can’t get great rates on its own for healthcare, etc., but with economies of scale through ADP, they can get much better rates.

Float: This is the best part of the business. A company might release funds to ADP on a monday and those funds get paid out on Friday. This allows ADP to invest the float, which might not seem like much, but with their scale, this is an incredible part of the business that goes directly to the bottom line. Last year, they made $1.19 Billion in Float (would be about 5.8% of revenue that goes directly to the bottom line).

**Forces work together to create a moat**

They have a few forces working in their favour. First, these large Fortune 500 companies dealing with 20,000+ employees can’t switch to another payroll processor easily. Once a company begins using ADP, it is very hard to leave; they have a 92% retention rate. Second, they have a global compliance “force”. They can pay people in 140 different countries with evolving tax laws. ADP has an army of lawyers and officers that smaller competitors cannot afford. Large companies cannot afford to deal with compliance headaches from small payroll startups. There is a saying, “Nobody gets fired for hiring ADP”. ADP also gets a ton of data on the US Job Market. They offer this data to businesses looking at the job market on “How much does a senior engineer in Seattle make?”

ADP loses low-end clients to startups and Intuit because a small coffee shop doesn’t care about such huge software and the higher cost. The risk is not that they lose them, but that they fail to win new ones.

**“A buoy stays afloat whether the tide comes in or goes out.”**

Not only is the float free money that goes directly to the pre-tax bottom line, but it is also one of the best natural hedges. As interest rates rise, the float earnings will naturally rise; meanwhile, other companies will struggle to grow. As interest rates decline, the float will decrease, but companies’ growth will accelerate and hire more people. The pool of float will increase, but the earnings from the float will shrink a bit. As companies hire more people, the other aspects of ADP will grow to hedge this. This phenomenon is one of the best inflation hedges in the world. Most companies can only hedge against inflation if they can raise prices. But ADP gets a hedge on both Price and Volume. Scenario 1: High Inflation -> Interest Rates Rise -> ADP earns more float. Scenario 2: High Inflation -> Companies give raises -> Float balance grows. 

On the other hand, during a recession, ADP has proven to be stable. Other companies will get hit with lower consumer spending. However, ADP doesn’t deal directly with consumers. Companies are much slower to react by firing their workforce. Often, they don’t react and just slow hiring. During the 2008 recession, ADP’s earnings actually grew.

This is one of the best business models I have come across. They have a natural buoy that helps them stay afloat during hard times and gives them a boost to ride the wave during good times.

**Growth**

ADP is not a fast-growing machine. Revenue has a 6.5% 10yr CAGR, and a 5.6% 3yr CAGR. Their gross margin has increased from 43.2% in 2016 to 48.4% LTM. Once accountants get used to the ADP system, they usually recommend it to new clients. Also, monkey-see monkey-do effect: 80% of the Fortune 500 companies use ADP, so when a growing company with aspirations of becoming a Fortune 500 company sees what the top-dogs use, they are likely to follow. Their operating margins % net income margins have increased by 7% over the past 10 yrs as well. You are not buying a growth engine, you are buying an insulated cash machine.

**Financials**

Their ROIC is about 30%, WACC (Cost of Capital) is 7.3%. This means that their spread is 22.7%. Most companies achieve a spread of only 2-5%. For every dollar of capital they invest into the business, they generate a 22.7% return above the cost of that capital. This is pure value creation (insanity). ADP pays negligible stock-based comp and virtually no CapEx. They have a 108% cash conversion. They pay out 4% in shareholder returns (Buybacks + Dividends), which is less than the money they make from their float. ADP essentially generates more cash than it knows what to do with. They have a treasury-adjusted ROE of 14.9% (strong management) and a ROA of 4.7% (barrier to entry). They carry very little debt and have an excellent balance sheet. They have one of the best self-financing machines if they require cash (their float). Management will continue to increase their dividend (50yrs in a row) and buyback shares when appropriate ($6B approved right now). Warren Buffett once said, “I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.” This is a business a fool could run (hopefully it never comes to it).

  
**A Quick Note on the Inflation Hedge**

Most businesses fight to raise prices to consumers during inflationary periods. ADP has automatic pricing power through revenue streams. During inflationary periods, wages rise, which naturally increases ADP’s revenue (from their payroll volume). The other lever that fights inflation is their float revenue. The Fed typically raises rates to fight inflation, which has a huge impact on ADP’s float revenue. The float revenue flows straight to the pre-tax bottom line. The final inflation advantage is the B2B nature of their mission-critical software. Fortune 500 companies are able to accept a small increased fee on mission-critical payroll software; it ends up being a rounding error for them. In the opinion of many, the current US Debt levels are unsustainable. In order for the US to start paying off this debt, the government will likely want higher inflation levels. I believe that more inflation is around the corner. Even if I am wrong, there is no harm in making this bet; it is a “safe hedge” because we are safer if there is inflation compared to most, yet unaffected if there isn’t. We are buying a great business at a fair price that has multiple safety nets.

And honestly, it's not entirely our fault.

Society gives us zero real education on reading social cues. We're supposed to just know the difference between someone being polite and someone wanting to jump your bones.

The good news? There are actual patterns to this. I've gone down a research rabbit hole (books, psychology podcasts, body language studies, the whole thing) and there ARE reliable signals. You just need to know what to look for.

**The Core Difference Nobody Talks About**

Friendly people include you in their world. Flirty people create a world with just the two of you.

Watch where their attention goes. A friendly person maintains open body language, might mention other people naturally, keeps consistent eye contact without intensity. They're warm, but diffused.

Someone flirting? They orient their entire body toward you. They create inside jokes within minutes. Dr. Monica Moore's research on courtship signals found that flirting involves ""attention holding behaviors"", like sustained eye contact, leaning in close even when unnecessary, finding excuses to create physical proximity.

**The Touch Test**

Friendly touch is brief and predictable. High five, shoulder pat, maybe a hug goodbye.

Flirty touch lingers. It happens in unusual places (lower back, inner arm, knee). It feels like testing boundaries. ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down perfectly. Friendly touch averages 1-2 seconds. Flirty touch? 3+ seconds, often repeated, frequently ""accidental.""

This book is genuinely fascinating, btw. The authors analyzed thousands of courtship interactions and the patterns are wild. Makes you realize how much communication happens without words. Best $15 I've spent on understanding human behavior.

**Listen to How They Talk**

Friendly conversation flows naturally between topics. Multiple subjects, balanced speaking time, comfortable silences.

Flirting has a different rhythm. According to research featured on the Huberman Lab podcast (specifically the episode on social connection), flirting involves more questions, playful teasing, callbacks to earlier conversation. They remember random details you mentioned.

The podcast episode dives into the neuroscience of attraction and it's genuinely eye opening. Dr. Huberman explains how our brains respond differently to friendly vs romantic interest, the dopamine patterns involved, why we get that ""butterflies"" feeling. Super insightful for understanding what's happening in your own head during these interactions.

**The Compliment Quality**

Friendly compliments target achievements or universal traits. ""Great presentation,"" ""Cool shoes,"" ""You're so funny.""

Flirty compliments get specific and personal. ""Your laugh is adorable,"" ""I love how passionate you get about random topics,"" ""You have really pretty eyes."" They notice details about YOU specifically.

**Use the Shift Test**

This one's from ""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty"" by Mark Manson. If you're genuinely unsure, slightly escalate and watch their response.

Stand a bit closer. Hold eye contact an extra second. Make a mildly flirty comment. If they're interested, they'll match or escalate back. If they're just friendly, they'll create space without making it weird.

The book is technically aimed at men but honestly the principles about authentic connection and reading interest apply universally. Manson argues most dating advice is garbage because it's manipulative. His approach focuses on genuine signals and honest communication. Completely changed how I think about attraction.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on social dynamics and attraction psychology but finding these books dense or hard to get through, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from resources like these, plus research papers and expert insights on dating and communication. 

You type in something specific like ""I'm an introvert who struggles to tell if someone's into me or just being polite"" and it builds you a personalized learning plan with audio lessons. The content's all science-based and fact-checked, drawing from books, psychology research, and relationship experts. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. 

It's built by folks from Columbia and Google, and honestly makes absorbing this stuff way easier than forcing yourself through multiple books when you're already overthinking every interaction. The voice options are great too, especially the smoky, conversational ones that make complex psychology feel less academic.

**Context Matters More Than Anything**

Someone working customer service being nice? Probably just friendly (it's literally their job). Someone who goes out of their way to talk to you when they don't have to? Different story.

Are they this warm with everyone or specifically with you? Watch how they interact with others. Flirty people create distinct energy with their person of interest.

**The Intention Behind Actions**

Friendly people are consistent. Their warmth doesn't spike around you specifically.

Flirty people show up differently. They find reasons to be near you. They remember your schedule. They engage with your social media beyond casual likes. ""Attached"" by Amir Levine breaks down how people behave when they're genuinely interested versus just being social.

That book helped me understand my own anxious patterns around reading signals. Sometimes we see flirting where there isn't any because we're desperate for connection. Sometimes we miss it entirely because we're avoidant. Understanding your attachment style helps you read situations more accurately.

**Bottom Line**

Stop torturing yourself trying to decode every interaction. Most people aren't that mysterious. If someone's interested, there will be multiple consistent signals, not just one ambiguous smile.

And honestly? When in doubt, you can just ask. ""Hey, I'm enjoying talking to you. Would you want to grab coffee sometime?"" Worst case, they say no and you stop wondering. Best case, you stop missing opportunities because you convinced yourself they were just being polite.

Trust patterns over single moments. Trust consistency over intensity. And maybe stop assuming everyone wants you OR that nobody does. Reality usually lives somewhere in the middle.

1r3wpbc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3wpbc,A few smokes from the week in review,"Plasencia Alma Fuerte Salomon, 7x58

\- Nicaraguan Shade-Grown wrapper (Jalapa)

\- Nicaraguan binder and fillers (multi-region)

\- 6 mos humi time at 65%

Attractive cigar, some minor wrapper imperfections but overall great construction. A bit tricky to get burning well. Initially flavors are very minerally with a touch of ammonia. Medium body, vegetal and floral first third. Burn is wavy. 

Second third improves as the cigar slims, cedar, molasses, sweet tobacco. Creamy, cocoa butter texture on finish. Coffee and Nic terroir. Lingering mineral and ammonia sweetness that I don’t much care for. Milk chocolate, baking spices and some nice complexity in last third. Burn struggles, needing touch ups which mostly ruin this nice finish.

I’ve had every vitola of the AF now and I must admit I’m just not a big fan. It’s a good cigar, just nowhere near worth the price point for me. All have had notes of ammonia which I find quite strange. 

Tatuaje T110 Corojo, 4 3/8x52

\- Nicaraguan Corojo wrapper

\- Dual Nic binders, Nic ligero filler

\- 3.5 mos at 65%

Plump, even roll. Fine grit to the wrapper, mottled with no visible oil. Bold graham aroma and cold draw. Pleasant right away, sweet graham, honey, aged tobacco. Syrupy molasses lingers in the throat. Medium body. Richness and finish jump forward an inch in. Bready notes, salt, graham and molasses up front. Cinnamon and baking spices. Fairly linear but enjoyable profile, nice blend.

H. Upmann Nicaragua by AJ Fernandez Heritage, 6x54

\- Brazilian Mata Fina wrapper

\- Nic binder and fillers

\- 5.5 mos at 65%

Love BRZ wrappers. Very dark, thick. Deep barn and espresso aroma. Dark earth, espresso, umami, nice mix of BRZ and Nic terroir. Linear but nice first third with finish lengthening. Jump in complexity in second, salt and plum/dark fruit, black pepper in flavor but not spice. Finish is very long and bold. Really nice balance of bitter/sweet/salty. Draw and burn are perfect. Fine example of Mata Fina over Nic, would love to try a slimmer vitola.",2,1771006654.0,cigar_refuge,1,1.0,False
1r3wouz,https://i.redd.it/102nrlqyzajg1.jpeg,"My humble perfume collection as a starter (M, 29)","Zara RWA (1200/-): Unique fragrance, perfect for winter nights just not very good projection and stays close to you. 

Blue by Ahmad al Maghribi (1800/-): Non-offensive, clean, fresh, minty, perfect for professional settings. Bought today so can't comment on its projection and longevity but smell wise its really good for office use.

Ajmal Silver Shade (750/-): Lemony opening turning soon into floral fragrance. Smells good (has a tiny metallic hint to it but it works just fine for me). Bought this last week, so cant comment on projection and longevity but right now those are weak.

Fursan by Khadlaj (2200/-): Bought today. This fragrance is so coconuty vanilla. Can work for females definitely but also for men / boys who are into gourmandish fragrance. I would love to wear this on me in winters.

French coffee by Al Rehab (1400/-): Niche milk coffee fragrance. Just good to have if you want to wear coffee smelling scent. I use it very occasionally in winters.

Oud Abyss by Dahabi (Indian brand, 65ml 1100/-): Sweet, with a touch of oud, mostly linear smell. Can be worn in winters. Was an impulse purchase. I liked it when I smelled it. But for the price - I dont think its worth it.

The other two were gifted from someone - bought from Saudi - one is sandalwood heavy, the other one is super sweet and can be worn very occasionally on festivals, etc.

I also smelled CDNIM EDT, Afnan SNOI, Kaaf, Fattaan, Asad multiple times in different sittings but did not like them much.

Some fragrances I liked when I smelled them in the store - Vetiver Pepper by Azha, Ajwad by Lattafa, Rasai Hawas Ice, etc.

Suggest some good frags guys.

1r3wotk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r3wotk/a_situationship/,A situationship,"I met her my first day of work, 1/11 an auspicious day. She had a mask on, but I could tell we liked each other. I lost 2.5 years waiting for her.



She found my twitter, I think. The algorithm recommended her and all her friends, in retrospect these things are like bullfights, I did not know what was happening to me. Never followed or liked one another, but I kinda thought she was using her tweets and likes to communicate. I did not know that this was a thing people commonly do. Now I know.



We worked together maybe 10 times or less, never interacted outside the walls of a busy medical clinic.



But the twitter thing continued. We never talked about it, never ever, she sorta tried once but it’s embarrassing so she bailed and we didn’t connect.



She moved away without the connection ever being openly acknowledged to me, although several of her friends seemed to be aware of it. I think sorta to teach me a lesson about trying harder for girls in the future. She seemed to say she’d be back, and I should wait. I decided to wait. More or less monogamously.



She started posting pictures with her boyfriend and my heart broke into a million pieces. C’est la vie.



She stopped using her twitter almost entirely. Odd accounts started interacting with me here and there, mostly weird bitcoin nonsense, never anything to do with my writing. My ex did stuff like that too, she actually had remote access to my old computer for a while, so I couldn’t really tell what was going on. But I decided to hope that this person I liked was behind them.



This all made me feel insane. It’s hard to talk about because I’m a pretty normal person and it makes me sound literally schizophrenic.



I started a diary online, linked to it briefly for like 24 hours in my twitter bio as sort of a test to see if she was reading. I wrote there for about a year, never got any meaningful confirmation that anybody was reading.



I avoided visits back home except for major holidays (she’d moved to the state where I grew up) so she wouldn’t think I was stalking her. I’ve been stalked, I’m sure she has too and probably way worse and way more often. I have an overactive conscience at baseline. And she lived down the street from my parents, in a building where I had previously lived, as she shared in one of our brief conversations in person. I didn’t even want to seem like I was following her around.



I reached out directly 5 times in 2 years asking for coffee and a clarifying conversation. Each time, she responded: “I am in a permanent committed relationship, do not contact me again.” So I left her alone for several months, then I’d try again because she continued to seem interested.



I think an open, honest conversation would’ve helped me to let go. But I clung, in my invisible, opt-in way. And she felt a lot of loyalty to me for that, 



The 5th time I reached out, I’d recently met someone and was then immediately ghosted but I was hopeful. Also there was a family tragedy and I got surgery and I took an 8 hour exam. A rough time. And I’d kinda leaned on this maybe-real-maybe-not connection for a couple of years.



I texted her. Checking in, asking if her relationship was safe because I was still pretty sure, truly just a gut feeling though, that she really was there and was becoming more active. And if so, what’s going on with that boyfriend?



She contacted my employer and I got fired. She regretted it, I think, because subsequently they reversed everything on paper without my doing anything. But without hiring me back. A few weeks ago, after my lawyer failed to get me a hearing, I went down there and someone told me that “based on what they heard” they wouldn’t want me back.



I’ve texted her a couple of times since hoping for closure. In a way she's one of my best friends. Someone I’d like to marry is profoundly invested in the idea that the above represents an entanglement on the level of like a child with FAS born to your ex before you met her and you tell Beth about it and she kicks you out of the house for 6 months then marries you and adopts the child.



A plan she ran past me, incidentally, and I halfheartedly agreed.



Anyway I’ve texted her a couple of times, no response. It’s almost as though the online component of the connection was playful, meaningful, but not aligned with her values and intentions in reality.",0,1771006627.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

Virginia-based true crime author Ron Peterson Jr. will be in store to discuss his newest true crime book, ""Runaway Groom"", before turning the floor over to the audience for questions. ""Runaway Groom"" covers the previously unsolved 1983 murder of good-hearted country boy Petie Miller, who disappeared two days before his wedding in Staunton, Virginia. Petie was suspected to have been murdered by his father-in-law to be, Charlie Almond, but with little evidence against Almond and no body discovered to prove the murder took place, he managed to escape charges. For three decades, Petie's father gathered evidence against Almond, tirelessly working to move the case forward and bring justice for his son. In 2015, special prosecutor Phil Figura took over the case. Almond was charged with murder, and went on trial in the oldest ""no body"" murder trial in U.S. history, with 32 years having elapsed between the alleged murder and Almond's trial. Ron Peterson Jr. is a Virginia-based author whose best-selling true crime books explore compelling mysteries and consistently receive five-star reviews.

Virginia-based true crime author Ron Peterson Jr. will be in store to discuss his newest true crime book, ""Runaway Groom"", before turning the floor over to the audience for questions. ""Runaway Groom"" covers the previously unsolved 1983 murder of good-hearted country boy Petie Miller, who disappeared two days before his wedding in Staunton, Virginia. Petie was suspected to have been murdered by his father-in-law to be, Charlie Almond, but with little evidence against Almond and no body discovered to prove the murder took place, he managed to escape charges. For three decades, Petie's father gathered evidence against Almond, tirelessly working to move the case forward and bring justice for his son. In 2015, special prosecutor Phil Figura took over the case. Almond was charged with murder, and went on trial in the oldest ""no body"" murder trial in U.S. history, with 32 years having elapsed between the alleged murder and Almond's trial. Ron Peterson Jr. is a Virginia-based author whose best-selling true crime books explore compelling mysteries and consistently receive five-star reviews.

What I have noticed is that I never used to get this kind of hit from instant coffee, am I crazy?

and yes I know that robusta has more caffeine but for the sake of this I tried this experiment using arabica for both instant and brewed coffee.

The one reason I can think of think of is, I only drink milk based drinks, so when I brew I don't have to add sugar because the sweetness from brewed coffee is enough, but I do need to add sugar when using instant coffee which might hinder the caffeine hit somehow.

Personally, I've found it to be a great tool to stay casually connected with people. It's much more reasonable to follow 15 people on instagram at the end of a commercial job than to get 10 people's phone numbers. 

Plus, I can honestly say that regularly interacting with people's stories has furthered many of my relationships. Finding out that the 3rd electric on one set actually has a fantastic cinematography portfolio has on multiple occasions lead to me camera assisting for that person. And even when it doesn't lead to work, it has lead to coffee meets, hangs, and generally a sense of community.

On the flip side, excessive screen time has had a pretty negative impact on my life. Endlessly scrolling on reels has impacted my sleep quality. My attention span has been reduced. And my ability to stay present is limited. 

I'm not as bad as some people, and fortunately can still get through a book or a movie without checking my phone, but I can genuinely see the ways social media has prevented me from achieving some of my goals. And I really don't want to start and end my day starting at a screen for an hour.

Honestly not sure how to manage this, and thought I'd get the opinion of others: How do you manage to stay connected in the modern world as someone in this industry while also maintaining a healthy relationship with something so addicting?",1,1771006258.0,cinematography,0,1.0,False

I once even had a dude follow me around the mall…that was really weird. I didn’t want to be an asshole. but I had to turn around and tell him to chill out. he asked if he could walk with me. I said no and he scurried off. Very Very strange because this NEVER happens before 20 days and NEVER in 35yrs of like before nofap.

also obviously get the look sometimes from women of all ages literally 15-55. not every day and it’s almost random but it just happens. Sometimes I think it’s after they hear my voice. this last time i ordered a coffee at a Starbucks and turned and bam dude was looking at me like he was in love. really strange (i would’ve thought this dude was straight by the way if it weren’t for the look and I hadn’t noticed dude at all until that look)

A guy got on with a takeaway coffee. The train started moving, he almost lost balance, and a few drops spilled on the floor. Nothing dramatic, like half a sip.

He looked at the floor for 2 seconds, then at the people around him, clearly embarrassed. I thought that was it.

At the next stop, he quickly stepped out, went to one of those little kiosks, bought a pack of tissues, came back in before the doors closed, and cleaned the floor where he had spilled. Nobody told him to, nobody complained, nobody even reacted.

The wildest part: this wasn’t some fancy panoramic train. Just a normal one on a normal day.

I was treating it like a performance.

It was exhausting and the results were mediocre. Every post felt like a transaction.

I shifted my mindset. Now, I think of Reddit like a giant, asynchronous coffee shop. I'm not there to pitch. I'm there to overhear conversations, join the ones where I have something genuine to add, and occasionally share a story from my own journey if it feels helpful.

The pressure vanished. My engagement became more natural. I started finding threads where people were discussing the exact problem my product solves, not because I was searching for them, but because I was just listening.

Has anyone else made a similar mindset shift from 'growth channel' to 'community space'? How did it change your approach?

P.S. The hardest part was finding the right 'tables' (subreddits) to sit at. I use Reoogle to discover those niche, high-signal communities where real conversations happen. It saves me from wandering into the noisy food court subs. https://reoogle.com",0,1771005926.0,saasbuild,0,0.5,False

I saw a post yesterday of a few people discussing potential travel to Phoenix, Seattle, or another western US show with ticket availability after so much difficultly for certain shows.

There is still plenty of tickets available in Phoenix (starting at $83). Chase Field will be air conditioned.

I understand airfare can be expensive, perhaps check Frontier or Allegiant (Mesa). However our hotel prices (and other costs) will be their lowest price all year because it’s a Wednesday in our hottest season.

There is a light rail you can take from the main airport to a downtown hotel for cheap, however it’s not very popular with locals especially at night. We also have Waymo self-driving vehicles that are typically the same cost or cheaper than Uber/Lyft. 

Downtown is walkable with good restaurants and nightlife, but has its parts to avoid like any city, stay in well lit areas. Resorts often have specials during that time of year for special rates and resort credit, like free breakfast and a $100 dining credit.

There are a handful of high rated affordable downtown hotels  within walking distance to concert. 

There’s plenty of affordable places to eat, especially locally owned. Here are a few of my downtown reccs for first-time visitors:

1. Taco Boy’s (duh)

2. Songbird Cafe (coffee & tea house)

3. Kavi Coffee & Café

4. Via Della (Pizza)

5. Cibo (Italian restaurant $$)

6. Cornish Pasty (British restaurant/pub)

**Who This Community Is For**

This is for people who use their phone like a tool — not like a toy.

• Heavy texters who spend hours a day replying, drafting, correcting, explaining
• Busy professionals who value time more than $8/month
• People working across multiple languages
• Social media managers, founders, salespeople, real estate agents, operators
• Anyone who prefers speaking instead of typing
• People who need their hands free — carrying coffee, using tools, wearing gloves
• Laptop workers who find it faster to generate content by voice on their phone
• Power users who want more than “just voice typing”

If you care about speed, control, and not jumping between apps all day — you’re in the right place.



**Who This Is NOT For**

• People looking for the cheapest possible keyboard
• Casual users who type a few messages a day
• Anyone who doesn’t care about optimizing how they communicate
• People who don’t like experimenting with tools or giving feedback

This is a power tool. It’s built for people who want control.



**Why This Keyboard Is Different**

Yes, many keyboards have voice typing.

But this goes further:

• Instant access to AI tools without digging through menus
• Custom buttons with your own prompts
• Tone rewriting in one tap
• Multiple languages accessible directly from the mic ring
• Record voice, switch apps, keep talking while reading
• Large editor one click away — edits come straight back into your keyboard

You can do serious work without leaving your keyboard.


---

**What This Community Is For**

• Sharing real-world use cases
• Suggesting features
• Technical feedback
• Power-user setups
• Prompt sharing
• Honest discussion about whether it’s worth the subscription

If you want to help shape a serious communication tool — welcome.

I’ve always been a bit more introverted (but can be extroverted in the right environments and right people) and I also tend to be particular with people. I’m talking in terms of who I trust and who I actually find interesting. 

In terms of who I am as a person, I’m a well rounded individual interested in various different things (art, fashion, nature, architecture, geology, animals, archaeology, coffee, books, film & tv, gaming, true crime sometimes, music, learning). 

Back in school, I wasn’t interested in being in the popular group or anything like that but there were girls I wanted to be friends with who I knew shared similar interests as me/who had nice interesting fashion sense/were artistic or musical etc. However, none of these girls who I personally deemed as “cool” (in my eyes, so again, not popular), never wanted to be friends with me. I would try to engage with them but they would always seem disinterested or give me a look or say that they would invite me to something and then not follow through. 

The people I was left with to be friends with were people who didn’t really have similar interests as me, the “weird/annoying” kids, or if they did have \*some\* similar interests to me, there was the issue of them always treating me poorly. There was a lot of subtle bullying for example, using me, stealing my boyfriend, letting bad things happen to me at parties etc. This resulted in me cutting those “friends” after high school ended. Also I’ll just mention here, good looking or interesting guys never wanted to be friends with me (or date me).

I have thought about what the issue could be a lot over these years. I have always been unhappy with my appearance and viewed myself as ugly but in a way, prettier than your stereotypical average “ugly” person. I have also always been told that I’m pretty all my life from family, peers, random strangers - but this has been conflicting to me as I’m certainly not beautiful. (This isn’t one of these cases where I’m someone who’s so beautiful that people were mean and jealous all my life, trust me). I’ve thought about my people skills and whilst I have struggled with depression (and anxiety) all my life, I have been able to be the funny girl, the outgoing girl etc where necessary. So I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

In my 20s, I have tried on and off to make friends with the people I find interesting, cool, pretty, stylish, intelligent, also more introverted etc etc etc. But none of these attempts have been successful and again I always seem to have.. “weird” people or people who have no interests beyond their work or dating. I have quite literally had creepy stalkerish situations happen to me with weird individuals both girls and boys becoming obsessed with me and causing me massive distress. (But do again because of that, I think to myself well surely I can’t be some major repellent, right?). 

I don’t even know what the point of this post is I guess I needed to vent my frustration and gain some clarity though i’m skeptical whether this can be achieved through posting about this on reddit. If anybody reading can relate, at all, that in itself would be helpful as then I would have the assurance that I’m not at least totally alone in this experience. ",1,1771005436.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Same walks. Same conversations that fade out too early. A few days later, on a cold evening, I remembered her message and opened DatingIdeasDB. com.

I typed in Kraków, scrolled briefly, and chose something before my brain could interfere. No comparing options. No saving it for later. I sent a short message with a meeting point and time and went back to my evening. It felt strange not to obsess over it, but also relieving.

The night was simple. We met near a small spot glowing warmly against the winter air, then wandered through quiet streets with snow underfoot. There was no rigid plan, just a loose idea that guided us. We talked more openly than usual, laughed at small things, and let pauses exist without rushing to fill them. It felt calm in a way dates rarely do.

At some point, the city noise softened and so did we. Walking side by side, shoulders brushing, the conversation slowed into something more intimate. When we stopped, the kiss felt inevitable but unforced, warm against the cold night, the kind you smile about later without realizing it.

That website did not manufacture romance. It simply removed the pressure to perform and plan perfectly. A friend passed it along casually, and I am glad she did. Sometimes letting go of control and deciding quickly is what allows something real to happen.",1,1771005345.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

* First, Created a new Power BI file and saved it as a PBIP project
* Then I made a Fake Coffee Shop data using GitHub Copilot and saved it as CSV 
* Connected the PBIP project to Power BI MCP, loaded the CSV data into the model, and made a Blank \_Measure table
* Used Claude to do the Coffee Shop data analysis and asked it to make multiple Measures in that \_Measure table to organize all measures
* Created a JSON theme file based on cherry colour to add to report.json for the report theme
* then asked the copilot to create multiple visuals  with proper instructions mentioned in [copilot-instructions.md](http://copilot-instructions.md)
* Based on the position of visuals then asked Copilot to make an SVG image with a custom BG design to insert it as a Canvas background Image
* So there are two layers: a Background SVG and Power BI Visuals on top
* That's it, your AI-based Dashboard is ready 

  
My Key Takeaways

\-Make a Template.pbip file with all visuals code and theme already added, and play with it instead of creating from scratch everytime as it is expensive in terms of Copilot credits

\-without proper [copilot-instructions.md](http://copilot-instructions.md) , AI will hallucinate a lot, so make sure to have it

You were the person on the sidelines, the one who got hurt, the one who had to sit out while everyone else kept moving. And if you had to actually wear the gear during daily life? It usually meant bulky, beige, squeaky contraptions that screamed “injury” from a mile away. People didn’t wear them proudly. They hid them under long pants or avoided certain activities altogether just so they wouldn’t have to explain themselves. But that is starting to change. And honestly, it’s about time.

Sleeve Stars has always believed that support gear shouldn’t feel like a punishment. When the team set out to design their signature product, they weren’t thinking about hospital rooms or post-surgery recovery zones. They were thinking about morning runs, long walks, and the feeling of standing comfortably in the kitchen while making coffee. They were thinking about real life. That is why the [ankle sleeve brace](https://sleevestars.com/products/plantar-fasciitis-ankle-brace) looks the way it does. It doesn’t scream medical device. It just looks like something an active person would wear.

The shift here is subtle but important. You don’t have to wait until you are 100 percent healed to feel like yourself again. You can wear the brace with shorts. You can wear it with joggers. You can wear it because you need support, but also because the matte black fabric and the clean lines happen to look pretty sharp. It is compression wear that pulls its weight aesthetically. And once you stop worrying about who is looking at your ankle, you start paying attention to how good it actually feels.

There is something liberating about that. About not shrinking. About strapping on the support you need and just going about your day without a second thought. The adjustable strap lets you dial in the exact amount of hold you want, whether you are walking the dog or heading into a meeting. The sweat absorbent fabric keeps things dry, so you aren’t constantly adjusting or pulling at it. It just stays put. It works with you, not against you.

A lot of people write to Sleeve Stars to share stories about getting back to things they love. Hiking. Playing catch with their kids. Standing for long hours at concerts. And almost always, they mention how strange it felt at first to actually like wearing a brace. But that feeling fades fast. Pretty soon, the ankle sleeve brace is just part of the outfit. Part of the routine.

We are moving past the idea that needing support means you are weak. In fact, it is the opposite. It means you are smart enough to keep going the right way. So wear it openly. Wear it unapologetically. The only thing you need to hide is the old belief that gear has to look clinical. That era is over.",1,1771005275.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

1r3w1tu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3w1tu,Outlet Placement for Tile Backsplash (and where to end tile),"Howdy,

We are getting prepared to have this wall tiled up to the bottom of a second shelf (two total) and I was starting to wonder about outlet placement. We are using a bold, teal-colored tile and I am thinking this white outlet right in the middle is going to stick out like a sore thumb.

Figured my options were relocate (maybe lower or off to the side), install a more decorative outlet (will have gold hardware + accents throughout so maybe a brushed gold receptacle/plate combo), or just leave it as-is and cover it up with something. It will be a coffee bar — or at least that is the plan. So there will be plenty of items on the shelves and countertop, but I love the tile and don’t want to be forced into “covering up” the front/center of the backsplash.

Maybe I’m overthinking it… but that’s what I do best, haha! 

I also put together a few quick (bad) examples of what I’m hoping for — so any other suggestions on where to end the tile would be great too. First picture is currently, with counters installed. My thought was end at bottom of second shelf like most do, but I don’t mind the idea of running up to door trim (and adding a piece of wood or tile trim between the doors as a cutoff point) was possible if done with the right material. Items on shelf were random stickers on my phone, including my pets (LOL).

Naturally I'm facing the corner of the room because I hate the light in my eyes.

There's this table of four (aged 30 somethings maybe) women - all mostly attractive in their own ways - sitting directly behind me and I can't help but overhear their conversation.  I mean, I'm by myself staring at the corner so in a way I felt like I was almost part if their converstaion - a ""fly on the wall"" of sorts.

Anyway, the most attractive one of the bunch, a beatutiful, perky blonde (there was something about her, I swear) is talking about a recent ex of hers and why he never proposed to her when she comes out with this gem, "" the hell with Brett,  you know?  I've got a vibrator"".  The whole table bust out laughing and, I have to admit, I chuckled a bit before catching myself, remembering that I wasn't technically part of their conversation.  I'm pretty sure they heard me, but I played it cool.  Finished up my coffee without ever turning around...

There were a lot of cars parked in front of the road, while the road is only a 2 lane road 1 lane was completely blocked by these cars that were parked and they werent any cars there was almost a mercedes, bmw showroom out of the school big cars of rich parents etc. and yet I question that these people talk alot about civic sense not being followed in India yet they are not aware themselves what civic sense actually is. and yes the cars werent parked there for 5 min or 10 min just to pick the students but since 2-3 hours 1 lane was completely blocked.  
Moreover just 500 meters away from that school there was a traffic at the red light as the red light is of only 10 -15 seconds and there are like very big potholes throigh which its very difficult to drive even at a speed of 15 Kmph therefore the traffic. and then I saw a tesla a new tesla with a number of ""1111"" going wrong side (as it was empty the other side) and then crossed the red light. CIVIC SENSE? A big question to ask these rich brats.

And before ask you that he might be getting late to go somewhere etc etc no I caught him again parking is car in front of a coffee shop instead I was waiting in front of the red light who had to reach office at time. i dont want to blow my own trumpet or something but after that tesla went from the wrong side 2-3 more cars took that options and then came a fleet of bikes and scootys going from the wrong side so that they just dont want to waste their 15-20 seconds on the red light then I just felt stupid waiting at the red.

CIVIC SENSE??????

Trust me India cant transform this way everyone here just cares about themselves and even in traffic if someone overtakes someone the ego is so small that they just cant handle.

1r3vz9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1r3vz9l/daughter_of_a_narcissistic_father/,Daughter of a narcissistic Father,"I’m coming to terms with the fact that my dad is a Narcissist. 

I was always aware of the fact my dad was an ignorant man, embarrassing and emotionally unavailable a lot of the time with an overinflated sense of self importance. 

My dad displays key complex’s that come with NPD. 

Grandiosity- His inflated sense of self importance and arrogance has always been nauseating (his decades as an emergency service worker fed his ego) 

Need for validation- I can remember being a child and recognizing my father’s thirst for physical attention and seeking validation for his image by me, his daughter. 

Lack of empathy- I’ve always felt like my dad’s never really listening to anything I say, no matter the importance. He does not listen to listen, he listens to react and stir up the next “him” topic that sometimes had no relation to the current topic. 

Any empathy I’ve ever witnessed him show, was exactly that, a show. A fake empathy. As long as it made him seem good and kind in front of anyone who was unaware of his true self. 

A very judgmental man who will point out the flaws in the best of people. 

Interpersonal difficulties- My mom divorced my dad when I was 5. My father constantly had women coming in and out of my life. Many times I have become close to women and whole families for them to be ripped out from underneath me. He was always to blame for the downfalls of the relationships, mostly due to affairs on his part. 

Vulnerability- He wants more than anything for people to see him as a confident and strong man which is far from the case. My dad is a very insecure and unhappy man. 

My dad loves to throw the shade but he is incapable of taking it. Having fun at other people’s expense is a terrible trait that he explains as “joking”. 

My dad overly depended on me emotionally as a child. When his relationships with women would fall through, I was there to pick up the pieces. He was a very unhinged parent during those times. I would miss school because I was afraid to leave him alone. He threatened suicide to me on more than one occasion. I was sleeping beside him because he was so distraught over the state of his life. He had breakdowns. Full meltdowns in front of me. 

Usually this would happen during break ups. To this day when a man gets too emotional in front of me, I get uncomfortable. I don’t know how to handle the heavy of it. My dad severely impacted my mental health. He convinced me that he was a victim of my mother. I treated my mother terribly when I was younger due to the fact that I believed she treated my dad poorly. My mom is a saint and she used to say to me “one day you will see things clearly” she refrained from speaking ill of him even during those times when he had completely turned me against her. On the contrary it was the exact opposite. Every marriage fail he’s had since then he has considered himself the victim of. He is the abuser. He’s a bully. No pictures of my mother pregnant with me because he made her feel so gross about herself. Which is why I took double the pictures of myself pregnant, for her. I grew up with a distorted self image and confidence issues because of my father. He has zero respect for women. When I was young he would parade himself around the city driving his car around searching for attractive women walking down the street all while I’m in the passenger seat watching him crank his neck to catch a glimpse and verbally comment on women’s appearances in front of me. It was not uncommon to find pornography siting on the bathroom counter that he’d left by “mistake”. Other instances that as an adult mother to a daughter I now cringe to think about. From a young age I had a distorted image in my head about what a woman’s appearance should be. 

He honestly is such a creep. 

As an adult I’ve stopped asking my dad for dad things or doing dad things with him. 

I struggled financially for years and he was the type of dad to say he’s there for you but it was always conditional.. typically humiliation. If I borrowed money it was hungover my head. Jokes were made about it, he would tell other family members and friends about it. 

I struggled in school and my dad made me feel lazy and dumb. Anything I did accomplish he found a way to give himself the pat on the back. He expects me to fall behind in life. He expects me to struggle. He doesn’t view me as a woman in her 30s with her own family and life. He sees me as an incompetent teenager who skated by on life with bad grades and low aspirations. He sees me as someone who’s always going to need help. 

So I stopped asking for his help. The quality time I spent with him gradually was less and less. The more aware I became of him the more turned off I became. I began to realize the emotional drainage he had on me. One coffee visit would trigger the anxiousness for a week afterwards. His negative attitude and urge to speak about only himself and tear others down is beyond exhausting. 

For a couple of years now i have been gradually setting my own boundaries with my dad. This came after his most recent divorce. I was 6 months postpartum with my daughter when I got the call from my step mom at the time, she had discovered his affair. My dad went off the deep end. Landed himself a stay with MH for 6 weeks after crying wolf on suicide again. During that time he fought to be the victim. He manipulated the entire experience. Used his own childhood trauma to avoid the current trauma he was inflicting upon others. 

My step mom took those 6 weeks to rid her life of him and she never looked back. Her and I worked together during that time. She included me in meetings with his psychiatrists to allow me to have an understanding of his condition. She knew she was not going to stick around any longer but she wanted me to have the tools. She wanted me to be educated and be able to protect myself and set boundaries for myself and my daughter. 

I heard it from the doctors myself with my own ears that what we are dealing with was a person with NPD. He has a victim complex with an overinflated ego and sense of self importance. A pathological liar living his life as his own fantasy. I sat across from my dad at a conference room table with my step mom beside me as the doctor explained in great detail what his findings were over those few weeks with my father. I walked out of the hospital that day with a sense of grief for this man I called dad. 

My step mom hugged me as we cried together and she told me to stay strong and educated. Let this be a turning point in your life. And it was. Her and I still keep in touch. 

My relationship with my dad hasn’t been the same since. In the years after that he’s claimed himself a victim of that relationship and he refuses to accept the diagnosis we received that day at the hospital. I sat in the same room as him hearing the words and he denies it as if it never happened. I’ve never seen someone able to distort a reality the way he does. 

Classic narcissist is never going to admit to being a narcissist and that’s exactly what he’s done. Denied it completely and pretends it never happened. He has on occasions attempted to convince me that he’s not a narcissist. To which I usually just comply to the conversation. Reminding him that he is in fact a narcissist is draining my own energy. My words don’t matter to him. I need to let him live in whatever weird reality he chooses. 

Fast forward he’s met a lady with a new family. He spends all his time and energy on her family and her grandchildren and myself and my daughter have been put to the back burner. My inner child is no stranger to my dad’s emotional neglect so when he began to remove himself from us and engorge himself into this new family my instinct was to shield my daughter from the feeling of his rejection. 

My daughter is an advanced 8 year old. She’s a very intuitive girl, a smart cookie. I sense her discomfort around my dad. I sense her pull back with him. She’s never developed a relationship with him the way she has with other members of the family. I believe she’s aware of his energy already at this young age and I sometimes wonder if she wants anything to do with him at all. 

I develop less and less in common with him and develop more animosity almost every conversation we have. 

My dad’s siblings don’t want much to do with him, they’ve moved far away or distanced themselves due to the relationships they have with him. 

My partner struggles to accept my dad due to the patterns he sees, the emotional struggles it has on me and the fact that he’s a self absorbed prick who can’t hold a conversation that isn’t about himself. 

I wonder if my dad will ever push me to a point of non contact. It makes me anxious to think about. It makes me anxious to disappoint my dad. I lived in fear of his disappointment my entire life. I was terrified to upset him even over little things. I was incapable of speaking up and even into my adult life, speaking up is something I struggle with. 

Do people with narcissistic parents continue a distanced relationship with boundaries ? Is that possible ? Do these situations typically end in no contact ? My biggest fear is the guilt that comes along with it. 

Is it appropriate to bring these concerns up to my daughter in an age friendly conversation ? How do you start that conversation ? 

It’s so unfortunate because I usually genuinely like the woman he brings around , his current lady included. The wounded daughter in me wants to look away and wait for it to crumble like it always does. However, the grown woman and mother in me wants to tell this woman to run in the opposite fucking direction and never look back. He destroys people’s lives. He preys on who he considers weak women who have abusive pasts or women with low confidence. He is a man of many faces and as much as I think it’s right to warn this woman. I want nothing to fucking due with the entire situation. I’ve been the one to pick him up off the floor every single time. I think it’s only a matter of time before this relationship also fails and he will come crying at my door for me to be emotionally available to him in his time of need. 

I will no longer be his therapist, his emotional rock, his validation. 

I want no part in any of that. 

So how do I choose to not be those things for my dad and not carry the guilt about it ?

1r3vyuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1r3vyuw/friend_visits_my_town_to_see_in_laws_and_other/,"Friend visits my town to see in laws and other friends but never visits me, lives an hour away and will never come further than halfway always wanting to meet near where she lives….","So basically as the title. My friend and I met when our kids were babies a few years ago, at the time she lived really close and we saw each other all the time visiting each others homes and meeting out and about. She moved an hour away from where I live 18 months ago, since then there’s been most occasions she will suggest places to meet which are closer to her home or for me to visit her home yet she never comes to me. 

At first she always wanted me to visit her, I did eventually have a chat with her explaining an over 2 hour drive for a less than 2 hour play date or to meet for coffee was too much driving and I started to suggest places around halfway distance between us. She’s been sort of receptive to it in that the last few times we have met it has been halfway or just over for me to meet her. My other issue with arranging a meet up which I’m driving 40mins to 1hour 15mins in traffic- 

She’ll often text 2 hours before meeting time to want to meet later like by an hour or sometimes more! My issue is by this stage as my child is young I’ve already begun to get myself and child ready for the long drive 

She’s always late and doesn’t bother to tell me until AFTER I’ve left my home as I’m the one driving the furthest I don’t then have the option to leave later and delay my own arrival leaving me waiting sometimes up to 30mins before she even arrives! She claims “you know what young kid is like” her child - yes I do my child is only 6 months younger I’ve the same things to sort for a MUCH longer journey and I’m getting fed up of it - you know how long it takes to get yourself and your child ready sort it out and sort yourself earlier. 

She’s suggested a meet up which is going to take me over an hour and just said “I know it’s just a bit further for you but it’s been done up” and I’m like but it’s not just “a bit” further she will have a 10min journey and me a 60-80 mins drive depending on traffic and same home with a small child. Other times I’ve made the journey to meet her with and without my child sometimes near to her sometimes halfway or slightly over, we agree to meet for a meal and everything or an evening out, last minute as I’m about to head out the door or already  and she knows I’m on the way she “downgrades” the meet up to a coffee only or play date only never apologises claiming “I already ate” “I didn’t think it mattered as we are meeting up anyways” etc 

Would I be an AH to not bother to agree to meet this time as she only wants close to her home? Saying to me she “can’t be bothered with driving” and never comes to me? 

For context she regularly visits her husbands family and other friends IN the town I meet never stopping to visit me or my home, and when I suggest it she says “oh we didn’t have time” or “I don’t think we can” so it feels as though she can be bothered for others and not for me! 

She can be a good friend a very good friend at times and is easy to talk to and all. We have had other issues regarding her behaviour towards me on a couple of other occasions which she has apologised for and we have had a great chat about all of it and as she’d been such a good friend at a time a few years ago when I was really struggling I chose to forgive her - however I don’t do forgive and forget but I do forgive but now I don’t know….it seems I put in most of the effort, she always has drama in her life and she vents to me via message a lot and I don’t have an issue with this per se BUT I have needed to vent about stuff at some points and she essentially half replies then changes the subject…

I know maybe I’m reading too much into it and it’s starting to appear the friendship may be running its course but I’m hesitant to just let it go…. I’ve been making less effort, sometimes that’s intentional other times I just don’t have time to reply as quick and I forget but I see the effort from her is sometimes non existent….anyone have any advice? There is the option of talking with her again but it only seemed to temporarily ease the travel issue and that’s now starting up again where she nearly just expects I travel to her",1,1771005043.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

yo so tijuana panthers are playing strummers on 02/14 and honestly trying to find a spot in the tower district on a saturday night especially on valentines day is going to be a total nightmare. the whole area gets super packed with people going to dinner or hitting the bars so you really need a game plan before you head out there.  
  
first thing you should check out is the Prked app because you can actually rent out a driveway or a private spot right next to strummers. it is way cheaper than the paid lots and you get to skip the circling around for twenty minutes looking for an open curb. it is a short walk and way less stressful than trying to squeeze into a tight spot on the street.  
  
if you do decide to try your luck with street parking you should look on fern ave or echo ave but honestly those fill up by like 6:00 pm. wishon and olive are the main drags and they will be totally full with valentines day traffic. there is a small paid lot behind the tower theatre which is just a block or two away but that lot is usually one of the first to hit capacity. another option is the public lot over by the bank of america on olive but again you gotta get there early. stay away from the spots labeled for specific businesses only because they are really quick to call the tow trucks in this neighborhood.  
  
make sure you pay close attention to the signs because the city of fresno is pretty strict about parking too close to corners or blocking residential driveways and you do not want to end up with a ticket or getting towed while you are at the show. traffic along olive is going to be moving slow so if you are coming from the 99 or the 41 give yourself way more time than usual. also just a heads up to keep anything valuable out of sight or just leave it at home because window smashes do happen sometimes in the busier parts of fresno.  
  
if you can get there at least an hour before doors you might find something a few blocks south in the residential area but just be respectful of the people living there. the walk isnt bad but it can get dark so just stay aware of your surroundings. you can also try looking near the laundromat or the coffee shop a few blocks down but those spots are hit or miss. hope this helps and have a blast at the show.",1,1771005005.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for movies, not necessarily 'true' dark comedies, but movies which aren't thematically funny, but the way things unfold makes situations funny in some way. Not funny comedic or satirical, but funny ""how did this lead to that in such short time"" kinda way, while maintaining a tense atmosphere. 





Where things escalate or spiral in a tense/chaotic and entertaining way to watch, not in a dark and depressive/traumatic way where things spiral from bad to worse in unsettling/disturbing ways. Some extreme example of what I don't want to watch would be The Coffee Table 2022, horrific escalation, or even Requiem for a Dream, the way things spiral out of control to a bleak conclusion. Full Time 2021 isn't as disturbing, but that much drama and struggle isn't entertaining to watch.







What is cool about this type of movies, is that we as the viewer know how these movies can end, but the surprise comes not from the outcome of the story, but from how they get to the ending. A bunch of unpredictable plot/story arcs connecting in bizarre and creative way, affecting the primary tone of the movie. Resulting in interesting genre blending, and tone shifting. Sometimes logical, and illogical ways.





Your recommendations don't need to have a happy ending. I don't mind if they blend other genres like action, horror, romance, ect..., if it's entertaining to watch, either slowpaced or fast paced is fine, I'm interested. Don't hesitate to recommend foreign movie also, or tv shows, or even animated tvshow and movies.





Movies/Shows I have as reference are (I won't spoil them, I will vaguely mention some parts). These movies slowly build up :



**Marty Supreme** (my favorite moment is when Marty is escaping the gas station, and what happens with the animal. The movie was fun until this moment,and the switch from fun to intense in an instant was unexpected for me. I didn't watch any trailers for this movie, and I'm glad I didn't. I had an idea how the story might end, but the way they got to the ending, I wasn't expecting these directions at all.)



**Anora** (this is an example of not a happy ending, bittersweet, but I enjoyed the way the story unfolded) 



**Red Rocket -2021** (the entire movie changes during the last minutes, after what happens with the car. The entire tone of the movie shifted in an instant)



**One Battle After the Other** 



**Beef** (tv show, this one starts funny, but ends up to serious and toxic)



**Why Dont You Just Die -2018** (aka Papa, sdokhni)



**All my friends are dead -2020** (Netflix polish movie. The entire tone of the movie changes in the last part of the movie)



**Bugonia** (Until the end, we don't know which one is lying. Very tense interaction until that character enters the closet)



Here are other examples, they are more fast paced action oriented than the ones above:



**Caught Stealing** (the movie seemed like a fun movie, until he went looking for that female person at her apartment. At any moment it could have been a sad and dark movie, but it ended fun and action oriented)


**Death Proof / Planet Terror** and some of Trantino's movies (it's more an action oriented escalation)


**Sisu** (1 and 2) (it's more an action oriented over the top escalation)



**Bullet Train** (it's more an action oriented over the top escalation)



**Oldboy -2003** (I like the action part, but the revelation at the end was truly insane. If a movie is that good, I don't mind an insane ending).



**Love Exposure -2008** (japanese tv show)



**The Forest of Love Deep Cut -2020** (japanese tv show)



**Cold Fish -2010** (Disturbing movie, but I liked this one)



**The Shallow Tale of a Writer Who Decided to Write About a Serial Killer -2024** (yes that's the title of one movie)



**Crank -2006** (it's more an action over the top, but every decision Statham makes spiral in even crazier and ""illogical"" situations)

At Indianapolis Cars & Coffee 2025 we met Loren Mears and his seriously rowdy 1968 Plymouth Road Runner!  
  
Under the hood sits a 400 block Mopar built with a 474 stroker kit making over 500 horsepower, paired with 3.91 gears - a combination that makes this classic muscle car an absolute rocket from stoplight to stoplight. Wide rear tires, classic Road Runner styling, and that unmistakable Mopar attitude mean this car gets thumbs-up everywhere it goes.  
  
Loring shares the story of how he unexpectedly discovered the car in a garage at a wedding reception… and ended up buying it just two weeks later. After some racing in its past, the plan now is to dial it back into a more comfortable cruiser while still keeping the muscle car spirit alive.

One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

Not because I don’t have friends — I do, and they would listen.

But I feel like no one truly understands me.

I need someone who resonates with me on a deep level, someone I could talk to about the important things and feel a connection.



On the outside, I’m disciplined: I set goals and pursue them.

But inside, there’s constant melancholy.

It feels like I lack experiences, emotions, and intensity.

And I start to wonder: if I remove emotions and romantic feelings — who am I then?



I often find myself alone with my thoughts.

And this silence feels heavy.

It’s like something has ended, but the new hasn’t begun.

I feel like I’m standing at a threshold, unsure of which way to go.



Sometimes it feels like God has removed unnecessary people or noise.

Perhaps this is a period when I need to change, wake up, and hear something important.

I prayed for guidance — and now I feel a tense stillness, like I’m being prepared for something.



Sometimes I wonder if I’m just used to strong emotions, and that’s why calm feels empty.

Maybe I’m confusing stability with the absence of life.



I long for simple but profound experiences:

walking in the rain with coffee, reading classics on a bench, watching sunsets, sitting in cozy cafes, meditating in the mountains, listening to music at night, breathing in the night air, looking at the stars.

I want love — tenderness, soulful conversations, strong hugs, intimacy.



But I notice I get attached quickly.

I wonder if it’s because I wasn’t given enough love.

Or am I trying to find through someone else what I should discover within myself?



I don’t fully understand what I want.

Is it just relationships?

Or something deeper — meaning, higher love, a sense of wholeness?



When I’m alone, there’s anxiety and anticipation inside me.

It feels like I’m preparing for something, but I don’t know what.

And I’m tired of living with this constant unease.

1r3vewe,https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1r3vewe/making_a_minimalist_cafe_management_game_focused/,Making a minimalist cafe management game focused on economics,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been building a cafe management game that focuses entirely on strategic decisions instead of animations or time-based mechanics.

The core idea:  
You manage a single cafe and make daily business decisions based on realistic economics.

There’s no tapping, no rushing customers, and no empire expansion. It’s about running one location well.

Each day you’re deciding things like:

* Equipment capacity vs demand
* Pricing strategy and margins
* Inventory allocation
* Staff morale affecting efficiency
* Weather shifting demand patterns

Example scenario:  
It’s raining. Cold drinks demand drops 30%, hot coffee demand rises 25%.

Your machine can produce 10 cups/hour, but demand is 18.

Do you:

* Raise prices?
* Buy another machine?
* Reallocate inventory?
* Accept stockouts?

That’s the core loop — making trade-offs under constraints.

To avoid it feeling repetitive, I’m also adding:

**Random events** **every few days, like**:

* Supplier delays
* Equipment breakdowns
* Sudden student rush
* Local festival boosting demand
* Health inspection affecting morale

And separate **challenge modes** with specific constraints and goals, for example:

* Survive 14 days with limited starting cash
* Maintain 90% staff morale for a month
* Operate only with one espresso machine
* Maximize profit during a bad-weather season

It’s intentionally minimalist visually — more control panels than animation — because I want the focus to be on decisions more.

I’m curious:

* **Would you enjoy a management sim that leans heavily into economics and constraints?**
* **Does a minimalist approach sound appealing or too dry?**
* **What kinds of events or challenges would make this more interesting to you?**

Appreciate any honest thoughts — I’m trying to validate whether there’s an audience for thoughtful, low-flash management games on mobile.

1r3vcpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1r3vcpo/kung_fu_trump_trump_v_deniro/,Kung Fu Trump – Trump v. DeNiro,"*original story by Philip Loyd*

Hi. My name is Roberto Dinero, and I’m from the LA. East LA. The mean streets, where it all goes down.

Shit. Okay, so you know who I really am. What gave it away?

But that’s not the point. Everybody has the right to use a pseudonym. If Martin Lieber gets to be Stan Lee, and Benjamin Franklin got to be Mrs. Silence Dogood, then I get to have a pen name too. That’s not the point.

The point is that most of you probably don’t remember me calling out President Trump. “This f\*\*\*ing idiot is the president? The guy is a f\*\*\*ing fool.” Yes, I said those things. But I was just getting warmed up.

“Our government today, which the propping of our baby-in-chief — the Jerkoff-in-chief I call him  — has put the press under siege, ridiculing it by trying to discredit it through outrageous attacks and lies.”

If I just would have stopped there, I wouldn’t have this little story to tell. But *No*, I couldn’t just let it go. That’s when I said that I wanted to punch him in the face. That’s when things started getting interesting.

So there I was getting shit-faced at home the other night, as people in my line of work often do, when the doorbell rings. “Who could that be at this time of night?” I said to my cat. That damn cat was no help at all.

I answered the door with much bravado and standing there were two men in black suits and sun glasses. Who the hell wears sunglasses at night? Corey Hart? Then I realized: they were Secret Service agents. What happened next I wouldn’t have guessed in a million years.

They told me to come with them, that the President of the United States wanted to see me. I downed another vodka martini with a lemon twist and followed them out the door. I mean, come on, who doesn’t go when the president calls, even if he is a f\*\*\*ing idiot?

They took me down to the loading docks, to this old abandoned warehouse there. My first thought was that they were going to off me. But if I could survive the Mob in movies like *Goodfellas* and *Casino*, I figured I could hold my own with these clowns.

Inside the warehouse there were a dozen more agents. A few beauty-pageant queens, as well. The vice-president of the United States was there, reading his Bible, the chief of staff too. Then he came out of the shadows, our very own dumbass-in-chief. The man with the small hands.

“So,” said the man with the small hands, “I hear you’ve got a few things to say about me.”

I thought I already said them. Idiot.

“And that you want to punch me in the face.”

You got that right: right in his orange f\*\*\*ing face.

“So,” he said, “what are you waiting for?”

Here, I asked him? Now? What about all his body guards?

“They’re not going to interfere,” he said. “It’s just you and me.”

I guess I’ll have to take your word for it.

“I must warn you, however,” he said, “that I have a black belt in Kung Fu.”

So what? I have two Oscars. Besides, he was wearing a suit. Bironi. And dress shoes. Cucinellis. He didn’t much look like a Kung Fu master to me.

“Bring it on,” he said, and then he went into a karate stance.

I was no fool. The second I went for him, his goons were going to stomp me within in an inch of my life.

“Let’s see what you got, Raging Bull.”

Raging Bull? Had he forgotten all about *Taxi Driver*? *Mean Streets*, too?

“More like *The King of Comedy*,’ he said, and that was it. No one insults my work.

It was at that moment we went for each other, like two sumo wrestlers. We exchanged blows, first me hitting him in the face, then him hitting me in the groin. A groin puncher, eh? Didn’t surprise me.

We went at it like Hung Well and Li’l Wang, which was really good for me being that I had never starred in a Kung Fu movie my whole life. I just imagined I was Bruce Lee. Method acting, you know?

“Bruce Lee,” he said? “Makes sense you’d choose an immigrant. “Myself, I’m Chuck Norris, a red-blooded American.”

What a f\*\*\*ing idiot. Bruce Lee was no immigrant; he was from San Francisco. And didn’t this moron know, as much television as he watches, that Bruce Lee kicked Chuck Norris’s ass in *Way of the Dragon*. I guess he only knew Chuck Norris from Walker, Texas Ranger.

“When I get done with you,” he said, “you’re going to be like in the movie *Awakenings*, and mostly resemble Frankenstein.”

Oh yeah, I told him: When I get done with you…  Shit. I didn’t have any references because the motherf\*\*\*er wasn’t in any movies at all, not unless you count Home Alone 2.

“Bring it on, Raging Bull.”

Raging Bull? Again? But that was no insult.

“Older Raging Bull,” he said. “Old and fat Raging Bull.”

Now he’d done it. That only motivated me more. For Hollywood actors, it’s all about motivation. And besides, I got an Oscar for that film.

We went at it like two Kung Fu Pandas, trading blows until we were both bloody in the face, all the while him insulting me like Muhammad Ali. We went at it like *Kung Fu Hustle*. *Big Trouble in Little China*, *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.

We went at it for what must have been half an hour. I could tell he was tiring by the way he was slowing down. When he went to catch his breath, that’s when I let him have it, a karate punch right to the belly. That should finish him off. As many Big Macs as he eats, he should have been softer than soft ice cream by now.

But he wasn’t. And *it* wasn’t. His belly, I mean. Instead, it was as hard as rock candy. All I felt was my hand being crushed, like that poor slob’s head with the baseball bat in *The Untouchables*. When I pulled back, I could tell my knuckles were all smashed to hell.

What the f\*\*\*, I thought? Was he truly a Kun Fu master? Was he really made of stone?

“Not stone,” he said, “steel.”

It was at that moment he began tearing open his shirt. Like Superman. Was Donald Trump just a secret identity, like the bumbling fool Clark Kent? Was he really the Man of Steel? Not hardly.

He opened his shirt to reveal a metal washboard. Washboard abs, my ass. The sunuvabitch was a cheater. Not only was he a liar, now he was a cheater. It shouldn’t have surprised me.

“You’re going down,” he said, “*Cape Fear* down. Then, me still holding my bloody hand, he knocked me to the ground.

Who did he think he was? Nick Nolte? More like Archie Edward Gouldie.

Archie Edward  Gouldie, better known as the Mongolian Stomper, was a professional wrestler back in the golden age of television who, when his opponents were down, finished them off with his infamous black boot.

What no one knew at the time was that the boot was full of lead. Enough heavy metal so that when he hit them in the head, it rendered them unconscious.

Such would be my fate as well, for little did I know that the man with the small hands was a huge, HUGE, professional wrestling fan. With as much TV as he watched, it made perfect sense.

I looked up from the ground and that’s when I saw him taking off his shoe: the Cucinelli. “This isn’t one of your Hollywood movies, Bobby,” he said. “This is the real world.” He then reared back and really let me have it, bashing me over the head with that shoe. That’s the last thing I remember.

When I woke up the next morning, the warehouse was empty. My head was killing me and that’s when I realized, the sole of that Cucinelli must have been lined with lead. How did I know? I own at least a dozen pair of Cucinelli myself, and more women have hit me in the head with them than I care to swing a stick at.

I’m 28 (F), NBSB, and honestly, I have no dating experience yet. May nagka-crush naman sa akin before, and may nag-try man ligaw, but I rejected them right away kasi during those times, life was really chaotic. I’m the eldest daughter and a breadwinner, plus my previous job was toxic. I’m in audit by the way haha.

Now I have a new job, better environment and good pay, and our family is also getting more stable, financially and emotionally. Life is starting to feel a little more peaceful, and I feel like I’m slowly healing from everything I’ve been through.

But right now I don’t see myself dating yet, maybe after a year, kasi I want to focus on recovering and taking care of myself. I’ve been so responsible for everyone else that even self-care was hard.

I’m also very reserved, so kahit may mag-chat sa akin if never ko pa siya nakausap in person, I usually don’t reply. And dating apps are not really for me. So when I finally feel ready to date, I want to go out more and meet people in real life.

Not the normal tired. Not “I slept six hours and had a long week” tired.

The kind of tired where your body remembers things your brain doesn’t want to carry.

I’d tried distance. I’d tried money. I’d tried another planet.

I’d tried every version of if I just change the scenery, maybe the ending won’t find me.

Then I started dreaming.

Not a normal dream—no weird mash-up of old faces and nonsense. It was the same dream three nights in a row, so precise it felt like a memory someone had placed in my skull.

I was underwater.

Not swimming—standing.

Standing in a narrow corridor lit by harsh red lights. Metal walls close on both sides. Pipes overhead. The air thick and warm, stale in a way you can taste. Every step sounded wrong, like the sound got swallowed before it could bounce back.

At the end of the corridor was a door with a wheel handle.

Not locked. Not chained.

Just closed.

And behind it—always behind it—I heard the soft, steady slap of bare feet.

Then the dream would shift slightly. Every time, my hand would go to the wheel handle. Every time, I’d hesitate.

And every time, I would wake up before I could turn it.

On the third night, I snapped awake with my heart punching my ribs. I lay in the dark and stared at the ceiling and felt the familiar pressure behind my ears—faint, like a bruise you only notice when you touch it.

The corridor.

The door.

The end.

I sat up, wiped sweat off my face, and whispered to an empty room, “Fine. You want a door? I’ll give you one you can’t open.”

It sounded brave in the dark.

It didn’t feel brave once the sun came up.

Because the dream didn’t feel like my brain freelancing. It felt like a suggestion. Like a lure.

And I’ve learned the hard way: anything that feels like a hint in this loop comes with teeth.

Still, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

A submarine.

A sealed environment.

A place built to keep pressure out and life in.

No windows. No easy entries. No open air.

If Mars hadn’t worked, maybe the answer wasn’t distance. Maybe it was containment. Not “hide behind a door,” but “hide behind engineering.”

It was a stupid plan, which is how most of my plans start at this point.

The first months of this cycle, I did what I always do: I made money fast, quietly. Not Mars money. Not “fund a starship” money. Just enough to grease the kind of wheels that don’t show up on official paperwork.

I didn’t go public. I didn’t become a face. I didn’t want attention.

I wanted access.

That led me to a man named Dwyer who didn’t smile with his eyes and spoke like every sentence was a transaction. We met in a diner off a highway, the kind of place that serves breakfast all day and has a wall of local business cards by the register.

He slid into the booth across from me and didn’t bother with small talk.

“You want to go underwater,” he said.

“I want to go somewhere sealed,” I corrected.

He sipped coffee like it tasted bad but he drank it anyway. “You want to go on a boat.”

“Not a boat.”

His lips twitched like he was deciding whether to laugh. “You know what you’re asking for.”

“Can you do it or not.”

Dwyer leaned back. “Why.”

I could’ve lied. Research. Adventure. Bucket list.

Instead I said the closest thing to truth I could manage without sounding like I belonged in a padded room.

“Because something always finds me on the last day,” I said. “And I want to see what happens when there’s nowhere for it to come from.”

He held my gaze for a long moment, expression flat.

Then, slowly, he nodded once.

“Alright,” he said. “How deep.”

That question hit me harder than it should’ve.

Not because of fear of depth—though I have that too now—but because it made it real.

“How deep can you take me,” I asked.

Dwyer’s eyes flicked to my hands, like he was measuring how steady they were. “Deep enough that you’ll regret it if you’re lying.”

“I’m not lying.”

“Everybody’s lying,” he said. “Even when they think they’re honest.”

He slid a napkin toward me with a number written on it. Not a phone number. A price.

I stared at it.

He watched my face. “That’s the price of a closed door.”

I paid it.

It took months. Arrangements. Paperwork that was mostly fake. A medical check. A “training weekend” where a man with a buzz cut and a clipboard taught me how not to panic in confined spaces.

I didn’t tell him I’d already lived panic in confined spaces a hundred different ways.

Halfway through the cycle, I stood on a dock under a slate-gray sky and looked at the submarine.

It wasn’t sleek movie-submarine stuff. Not a nuclear giant with flags and ceremony. It was smaller, matte black, utilitarian. A tube with seams and hatches and no personality.

It looked like something that existed to go places humans were not meant to be.

The crew was small. Ex-military types and private contractors. People who didn’t ask questions as long as the money cleared.

They called me “sir” without warmth.

That suited me.

The first moment I climbed down the hatch, my chest tightened.

The claustrophobia didn’t hit like a wave. It hit like a hand closing around my throat.

The ladder was cold under my palms. The opening above me shrank as I descended. The air inside smelled like metal, oil, and something faintly sour that reminded me of old gym mats.

A man named Haskins—broad shoulders, shaved head—stood at the bottom and guided me out of the ladder well.

“Watch your head,” he said.

The ceiling was low enough that I had to duck slightly. The passageway was narrow, barely wide enough for two people to pass without pressing shoulders.

Red lights glowed above bulkheads. Pipes ran along the walls. Every surface looked like it had been cleaned a thousand times and still couldn’t shake the feeling of being used.

This was it.

A sealed corridor.

A closed door.

The dream, but real.

My stomach rolled.

“You okay?” Haskins asked.

“I’m fine,” I said, because lying is my main skill now.

He grunted like he didn’t care. “Captain’s forward.”

He led me through tight compartments. Everything felt designed to remind you you were inside a machine. The air was warm, recycled, thick. Every breath felt like it belonged to someone else first.

The captain—Merritt—was a woman in her fifties with sharp eyes and a voice that didn’t waste words.

“Ground rules,” she said, standing in the control room with hands on hips. “You don’t touch what you’re not told to touch. You don’t wander into restricted compartments. You don’t distract my people. You stay out of the way.”

“I will.”

She nodded once. “Good. Because out there”—she jabbed a thumb upward, meaning the surface—“we can open a hatch and let you breathe fresh air. Down here, we can’t.”

I swallowed. “How airtight.”

Merritt looked at me like I was asking whether water was wet.

“Completely,” she said. “That’s the point.”

I forced myself to ask, casual, “Nothing gets in.”

She snorted. “If something gets in, we’re all dead.”

Perfect.

We submerged that night.

The sensation wasn’t dramatic. No giant tilt. Just a subtle shift in vibration, a change in the hum under your feet, like the whole vessel took a deeper breath.

Then Merritt announced over the intercom, calm as a weather report: “Diving. Secure all compartments.”

I felt the weight of the ocean settle on us like a thought I couldn’t shake.

There are no windows on most submarines. You don’t see the water. You feel it in your imagination. You feel it in the way the hull creaks faintly as pressure increases. You feel it in the knowledge that you are inside a sealed tube in the dark, and outside that tube is a force that can crush you without emotion.

The first week down there, my plan almost felt like it was working.

The pressure behind my ears didn’t vanish—nothing ever vanishes—but it felt muted. Distant. Like the countdown was having trouble reaching me through all that water.

I slept in a narrow bunk that felt like a drawer. A thin mattress. A curtain. Barely enough space to sit up without hitting the ceiling.

At night, the hum of machinery was constant. Fans. Pumps. The low, steady vibration of propulsion.

It should’ve been comforting. White noise.

Instead it made it worse, because it meant silence never came. And when silence never comes, you start hearing things inside the noise.

A shift in pitch.

A click that repeats.

A scrape that maybe wasn’t there before.

I tried to keep myself busy. I ate meals that tasted like salt and fatigue. I played cards with crew members who laughed like it was a habit. I listened to Merritt talk shop in the control room, the language of sonar and ballast and depth.

And I counted days.

Always counting.

The end of the cycle doesn’t announce itself with a calendar pop-up. It announces itself in my body. In my skull. In the way my nose bleeds when I’m not stressed. In the way static shows up in recordings that shouldn’t have static.

On day three submerged, I clipped my body cam to my chest and recorded myself walking the main corridor, narrating the date and our depth.

When I played it back later, the audio was mostly just my voice and the hum.

But right at the end of the clip, there was a faint sound underneath everything.

Soft.

Steady.

Like bare feet on metal.

Once.

Then again.

I rewound it until my thumb hurt.

It was there every time.

Not loud.

Just… present.

I didn’t tell anyone.

What would I say? “Hey, I think something impossible is walking in our walls”?

Merritt would’ve had me sedated or dumped me back on land at the earliest safe point.

So I kept it to myself, and I kept counting.

Halfway through that cycle, a strange comfort settled in. The kind of comfort you get in a locked room when you’ve been chased long enough.

Because the submarine felt like a promise: sealed means sealed.

If the creature was physical, it couldn’t enter.

If it was something else—something that didn’t need air or doors—then I was out of ideas anyway.

The dream came back.

Same corridor. Same red lights. Same wheel handle.

But now, sometimes, in the dream, my palm would touch the handle and it would feel warm, like someone else had just touched it.

Then I’d hear the slap of feet.

Closer.

And I would wake up choking on recycled air.

The crew started noticing me.

Not because I talked about the loop. Because I stopped being able to fake normal.

Haskins caught me once in the corridor at 03:00, standing still with my ear pressed to a bulkhead like I was listening to the hull.

“What are you doing,” he asked.

“Couldn’t sleep.”

He stared at me, then glanced at the wall like he might actually hear something.

“You hear something?” he asked.

My pulse jumped.

“No,” I lied.

Haskins nodded slowly, not convinced. “If you hear something, you tell someone. Pipes rattle. Valves fail. This isn’t a place to keep secrets.”

“I will,” I said.

He walked away, boots thudding heavy on the deck.

When his footsteps faded, I stood there another minute and tried to convince myself I hadn’t heard something else underneath them.

A softer sound.

Bare feet.

The last month came faster than I expected.

It always does.

Time in the loop is normal until it isn’t. Then suddenly you’re staring at an end date and realizing you’ve wasted five years on another “maybe.”

The pressure in my skull surged again. It felt like the ocean had moved inside my head. Like my brain was filled with water and someone was squeezing.

I woke up with blood crusted under my nose more than once. I wiped it away and kept going.

Merritt noticed my pale face and asked once, “You sick?”

“Just not sleeping.”

“Try,” she said, like that was an instruction you could follow.

Three days before the end—because by then I could feel it down to the day—I was in the mess eating something that looked like stew and tasted like warm salt. The crew was laughing about a story involving seasickness, which is like laughing about drowning.

I tried to laugh with them.

And then the lights flickered.

Just once.

A blink.

Every head lifted.

Merritt’s voice came over the intercom immediately. “Control, report.”

A man answered, calm. “Momentary voltage drop. Stabilizing.”

The lights steadied.

The crew went back to eating, but the laughter didn’t return the same.

I set my spoon down and listened.

Under the hum, under the chatter, under the fans…

Soft.

Steady.

A slap.

Then another.

I pushed back from the table so fast my chair scraped.

Haskins looked up. “You okay, sir?”

“I need air,” I said, which was stupid because there is no air down here besides what we recycle.

I moved through the corridor, shoulders brushing walls, pushing past crew members who flattened themselves to let me by.

The claustrophobia had been a background ache for weeks. Now it became a fist in my chest.

Because the truth hit me with cruel clarity:

A submarine is airtight.

Which means if something gets in…

There is nowhere to run.

I ended up at the forward bulkhead door—the one with the wheel handle.

Not because I planned it.

Because my body followed the dream.

The door was shut. The wheel handle was cold.

On the other side was a compartment I wasn’t supposed to be in. Maintenance space.

I stared at the wheel like it might turn by itself.

My hands shook.

Then the banging started.

Not on the door.

On the hull.

At first it was so faint I thought it was mechanical. Pressure creak. A shifting piece.

Then it happened again.

A dull, resonant thump that traveled through the metal under my feet.

The crew noticed immediately. Submariners are trained to notice abnormal sounds. Their lives depend on it.

Voices rose behind me. Footsteps. Boots.

Merritt appeared in the corridor, eyes sharp. “What the hell is that.”

Another bang.

Harder.

Merritt barked, “Sonar! Give me a contact.”

Over the intercom: “No contact. Nothing on sonar.”

Bang.

The corridor lights flickered again.

I tasted copper.

My ears popped, and my right ear went muffled for a second—like my body reminding me: this is the end.

Haskins stepped closer, voice low. “You know something.”

I looked at him.

Big man. Tough. Trained.

And in that moment, he looked slightly unsure. Like the sub had become unfamiliar.

I could’ve told him the truth. All of it.

Instead I said, “It’s here.”

Haskins stared. “What’s here.”

Another bang.

This one wasn’t somewhere distant.

It was right above us.

The sound traveled through the metal like a fist through a door.

The lights died for half a second.

When they came back, the emergency red glow made the corridor look exactly like my dream.

My mouth went dry.

Merritt swore. “All hands, brace. Seal—”

She didn’t finish.

Because the banging changed.

It moved.

Not along the hull like something swimming around.

It moved with purpose, traveling in a straight line.

Toward us.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Each hit harder than the last.

I felt it in my teeth.

Then it stopped.

The sudden absence was worse than the noise.

The hum of the sub filled the silence like a held breath.

Merritt’s eyes flicked to the wheel door in front of me.

She stepped forward, hand reaching for the handle.

“What are you doing?” I croaked.

She shot me a look like I was insane. “If we’ve got a breach, we isolate it. We—”

The wheel handle turned on its own.

Slowly.

Smoothly.

As if a calm hand was spinning it from the other side.

Merritt’s face tightened.

Haskins grabbed her shoulder. “Cap—”

The door swung inward.

Cold air didn’t rush in. No dramatic whoosh. No spray.

Just a dark gap.

And beyond it, a figure unfolded into the corridor like it had always been there.

Ten feet tall.

Emaciated.

Naked skin pale against red lights.

No eyes.

That grinning mouth.

Someone screamed—raw and high.

Merritt stepped back, reflexive, reaching for a sidearm she didn’t carry in a tight steel tube underwater.

Haskins moved in front of her without thinking.

The creature didn’t look at them.

It looked at me.

And this time it didn’t pause.

It didn’t observe.

It advanced with speed that turned the corridor into a trap instantly.

Haskins swung first. A human response to an impossible thing. His fist hit the creature’s chest.

It was like punching a steel pole wrapped in skin.

Haskins recoiled, pain flashing across his face.

The creature’s hand snapped out and caught him by the throat.

One-handed.

Lifted him.

Haskins kicked, boots scraping metal, hands clawing at pale fingers that didn’t indent.

The crew froze for a half-second—the brain’s helpless this can’t be real moment—then chaos erupted.

People shouted. Someone tried to run and slammed into a bulkhead because there was nowhere to go.

Merritt grabbed Haskins’s arm, trying to pull him free.

The creature didn’t even turn its head.

It slammed Haskins into the ceiling.

Once.

The sound was thick and wet.

His body went limp.

Merritt made a noise—half rage, half disbelief—and lunged forward.

The creature released Haskins and stepped over him like he was equipment.

It came straight for me.

The pressure in my skull peaked. A white-hot squeeze that made my vision narrow.

I tried to run, but run where? The corridor was a metal throat and I was the last thing in it.

I backed up until my spine hit the wall.

The creature stopped inches from me.

Its breath—if it had breath—didn’t fog the air.

It leaned down and opened its mouth wider than a face should allow.

And for the first time underwater, I understood how absolute this was.

A submarine is airtight.

It didn’t matter.

It never mattered.

It took me.

Violently.

No patience.

Like Mars.

The last thing I saw was red emergency light reflecting off its teeth.

Then the world snapped.

—

I woke up in a bright room.

Fluorescent lights.

Air that smelled like carpet cleaner and stale coffee.

A pen in my hand.

A salesman’s voice.

“Listen,” he was saying, “I’m just trying to take care of you. People don’t think about… you know. What if—”

My stomach flipped.

Honda dealership off Route 17.

The beginning.

The same beginning as the first time.

I dropped the pen. It clacked and rolled.

The salesman blinked at me. “You alright, man?”

My hands were shaking.

I stared at the glass window, at my reflection, and for a second I expected to see pale skin and a mouth behind me.

Nothing.

Just me.

Same scar at my eyebrow.

Same tired eyes.

I pushed back from the desk.

“I can’t,” I said.

The salesman’s smile faltered. “Can’t what?”

“I can’t do this,” I said, and I didn’t mean the car. I meant the entire shape of my life that always leads to the same end.

I stood.

And he was there.

By the entrance, like he’d been waiting for my chair to scrape.

Red raincoat. Hood down. Damp hair. White plastic bag in his hand.

Ordinary face.

Ordinary eyes.

It made my skin crawl anyway.

He didn’t smile big. He didn’t act theatrical. He looked… familiar in the worst way. Like a man you’ve seen in a dream and can’t place.

“You’re quick today,” he said.

My blood went cold.

People walked past him without reacting. A couple arguing quietly. An older guy in a baseball cap. Nobody noticed him in the way that mattered.

“You did that,” I whispered.

He blinked once. Slow. “Yes.”

“All of it,” I said. “The five years. The resets. The thing.”

He watched my face like he was taking notes. “You can call it a test.”

“A test for what.”

He shifted the plastic bag in his hand. The corners of something rectangular pressed against the thin film. “For people who keep postponing consequences.”

My throat tightened. “You said it was fun.”

A faint pause. “Sometimes.”

“You’re—what—punishing me?”

He didn’t deny it. He didn’t confirm it. He just said, “There are rules.”

“Then say them.”

His gaze held mine. Flat, clinical. “I can’t change your life. I can only give you the same span of it.”

“And the creature.”

“That’s what closes the span,” he said. “That’s all.”

My hands clenched. “So you can end it.”

“I can stop it,” he corrected, like my wording mattered.

“How.”

He didn’t look at the ceiling or the sky or anything dramatic. He nodded once toward the desk behind me. Toward paperwork. Toward a pen. Toward a choice that looked stupidly small.

“You keep trying to get out,” he said. “You don’t try to choose differently.”

I felt heat rise in my chest. “I went to Mars.”

He stared. “And turned it into another escape.”

My jaw tightened.

He continued, voice even. “There’s another rule, too. I don’t touch you unless you arrive at the end still believing you can buy your way past what you’ve done.”

The words landed like a weight.

I swallowed. “What I’ve done.”

He didn’t answer immediately.

Then he said, “You want a specific?”

And a memory hit me so clean it stole my breath.

My phone in my hand. A text thread with my sister’s name at the top.

SHE’S IN THE HOSPITAL. PLEASE.

My mother.

My mother’s heart.

And me, sitting on my couch with my laptop open, watching stock charts, watching a number climb, telling myself, I’ll go tomorrow. I can’t miss this window.

I remembered typing:

I can’t right now. I’ll call later.

I remembered not calling.

I remembered “later” becoming “after hours” becoming “tomorrow.”

I remembered the voicemail I didn’t listen to until the world had already changed.

My throat burned.

The raincoat man watched my face like he’d seen this reaction before. “That’s what you keep doing,” he said. “Later.”

My knees felt soft.

“You’re saying I deserve—”

“I’m saying you’re consistent,” he replied. “That’s why this works on you.”

My hands shook.

I looked at the salesman. He was watching me with polite concern. Tie slightly crooked. Smile forced, but not cruel. Just a guy at work.

“Sir?” he asked gently. “You still with me?”

I looked down at the pen.

A ridiculous object to carry the weight of my entire existence.

I picked it up.

The salesman’s face brightened in relief. “Okay. Just sign there, and we’ll—”

I set the pen down without signing.

“I’m not buying it,” I said.

The salesman blinked. “Uh—okay. That’s fine. Your deposit—”

“Keep it,” I said, and the words surprised me with how steady they sounded. “I’m sorry for wasting your time.”

His eyebrows lifted. “You—”

“I mean it,” I added. “Have a good day.”

I stood up slowly.

The raincoat man watched me, expression unreadable now.

I walked toward the door.

Every step felt like walking across a minefield.

At the threshold, he stepped closer—not blocking me, not looming. Just close enough that I smelled laundry detergent and cold air again.

“That’s a start,” he said.

My throat tightened. “Is it enough.”

He didn’t answer.

He lifted two fingers and touched the side of my head, just behind my ear.

The pressure behind my ears spiked—sharp, surgical—like someone flicked a switch inside my skull.

I gasped.

My vision blurred for half a second.

Not darkness. Not a blackout.

More like a camera losing focus.

I grabbed the doorframe.

“What—” I started, but the word fell apart in my mouth. I couldn’t find the next one. I knew what I wanted to say. The language for it slid away.

He watched me calmly. “You earned the lesson,” he murmured. “Not the map.”

Cold slid down my spine.

“You’re wiping it,” I whispered, and even as I said it, the sentence didn’t feel attached to anything. Like it belonged to someone else.

He nodded once. “If you keep the whole thing, you’ll turn it into another advantage.”

I tried to hold onto details—red corridor, banging hull, Merritt’s face, Haskins’ boots—like you hold onto a railing in turbulence.

They started slipping anyway.

Not all at once.

In chunks.

First a name: my sister’s—my tongue couldn’t find it. I saw her face, I saw the thread, I saw her crying in a kitchen in some year, but her name… it was a blank space you kept stumbling into.

Then a word: submarine. I knew what it was. I could picture the hatch and the ladder and the red lights, but the word itself went soft at the edges, like it was written on paper left in rain.

My breath came fast.

The raincoat man stepped back, already done with me. “Maybe you’ll choose right without needing to be chased,” he said.

I tried to speak, but my mouth felt full of cotton.

He lifted the white plastic bag slightly—casual, like a goodbye.

Then he turned and walked away, blending into the showroom like he belonged there.

I stumbled out into the parking lot.

Cold air hit my face. Exhaust fumes. Wind. A cart corral rattling.

My heart was pounding like I’d just survived something physical.

I stood there trying to grab onto what I’d just lived, but it was already draining—like water through fingers.

I knew I’d been somewhere deep. I knew there had been red light. I knew there was a grin. A mouth. A sound like bare feet.

But every time I tried to pin it down, it slid.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A calendar notification.

I pulled it out automatically and stared at the screen, confused, like I’d forgotten what I was looking for.

I blinked hard.

My head throbbed behind my ears, a dull ache like a bruise.

I walked back inside because my body didn’t know what else to do.

The salesman was still at the desk, paperwork laid out, pen waiting.

He smiled at me with that forced friendliness again, like we were picking up where we left off.

“Listen,” he said, “I’m just trying to take care of you. People don’t think about… you know. What if—”

My stomach turned over, slow and heavy.

A weird sense of déjà vu crept up my spine.

My mouth moved before my brain could catch it.

“What if a deer runs into the side of it,” I said—at the exact same time he did.

The salesman blinked at me like I’d reached into his mouth and pulled the sentence out.

Then he laughed, uncertain. “Man… you must sell cars.”

I stared at him.

My hands were shaking.

&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Ah...there you are.  
...Can you spare me some of your time?  
I'm gonna head out now so come with me.  
Also please, hold this package for me.  
  
**Guda**: Where are we going?  
Could this be cho...  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Never mind that, hurry, we don't have time.  
I've finally...  
──────Found the ""target"".  
&nbsp;  
We hide under a bridge with Gensai like during the Gudaguda event.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
They should pass by up ahead there, so let's keep watch here for the time being.  
........  
What's wrong...?  
Aah, now that I think of it, we've hid under a bridge together with bated breath like this before.  
That time we were being chased, but this time we are the ones doing the chasing.  
It will be to our detriment if we tense up too much, but do not let your guard down either.  
  
**Guda**: ...Who's our target? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: A very cautious guy that I've been aiming for for a while now. I had a hard time trying to find them.  
But I've finally grabbed their tail.  
  
**Guda**: You've been chasing someone? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Yes, the whole time.  
Once I got someone in my sights, I won't let them escape from me no matter what. That's how I roll.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
That look on your face, do you have something to say?  
  
**Guda**: Didn't you quit doing this type of...  
Can you really not let them off the hook...  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
No.  
I can't let them escape. No matter what.  
........  
Are you scared, by any chance?  
I'm sorry, bringing you along was a failure on my part in that case.  
Still, I can't turn back anymore.  
  
**Guda**: Like I thought, you can't be doing this. I'll make you turn back.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Why are you so...  
However, I can't listen to that request of yours. If I say I'll do something, I'll definitely carry it out.  
I won't let anyone get in the way of what I've decided on.  
That's the kind of person I am.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: They're here...!  
This time, I definitely...  
──────Won't let you escape!  
  
**Cat**: Meow~  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...I've finally caught you.  
At last, your time has come.  
  
**Guda**: Oh, so it was just a cat...  
Had a feeling this was the case.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Fufu, I've also brought some catnip as a gift.  
  
**Cat**: Meow meow!  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: No need to be in such a hurry.  
It's in the package I handed to you so please take it out.  
  
**Cat**: Meow meow meow~  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...Seems like they liked the gift.  
The plan was a success.  
It would appear you being here was helpful as well.  
They wouldn't let me get close when it was just me.  
........  
I am, you know...the hated Viper, after all.   
People and cats alike hate me.  
  
**Guda**: That's not true at all (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I see...it makes me happy even if you just said it as flattery.  
  
**Guda**: I like you though (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ! ...Don't say something like that all of a sudden.  
  
**Cat**: Meow meow!  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Sorry, but there's no more catnip.  
...That's not it?  
Are you letting me hold you in my arms, by any chance?  
  
**Cat**: Meow.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Is that so...thank you.  
Then I won't hesitate.  
&nbsp;  
Gensai cradles the cat.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ... (inhales)  
Phew...this is very calming...  
I've been quite fond of this kitty every since I first saw them.  
It wouldn't let me approach it at all before, but it seems like today is special.  
  
**Cat**: Meow.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...You're leaving already?

Gensai sets the cat down.

The cat leaves.

**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Hey, how does it feel to be liked by others?  
The people around you trust and care for you.  
  
**Guda**: Do they? ...Guess they might. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Not might, they definitely do. For sure.  
  
**Guda**: I don't really understand it myself. (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I'm astounded...to think you weren't even aware of it.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I want to be liked by cats so I might be a little envious of you.  
........  
Thank you for keeping me company.  
Come, let us return.  
Also, this is not all I wanted your time for.  
  
**Guda**: What business did you have with me? (Option 1)
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: What, you ask...  
  
**Guda**: It wasn't just the cat? (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: It wasn't the cat.  
Well, I can't say it had nothing to with them.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Don't worry about it and let's just go.  
&nbsp;  
We enter a coffee shop.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Thank you for waiting, goshujin-sama.  
  
**Guda**: What are you trying to start? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Fufu, no need to panic...  
  
**Guda**: Goshujin-sama's a bit... (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Is that so? But this is what a maid's etiquette dictates.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Now, let us begin.  
Ahem...  
Welcome to my establishment, dear guest of mine.  
Today is Valentine's Day.  
A special day comes with special service.  
So I've prepared something for my precious guest.  
&nbsp;  
Gensai hands over cat-shaped cookies.  
&nbsp;  
**Guda**: Thank you. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Fufu...I'm glad they made you happy.  
  
**Guda**: These are shaped like the faces of cats...  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Yes, I tried to make them look like that kitty.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
Actually, these chocolates were made by me. What do you think?  
Have I told you before? My dream is to open a coffee shop.  
No, it might not be a dream, but something that has happened somewhere.  
It might also be an event that hasn't happened yet.  
I don't remember it well, but it's surely something along those lines.  
........  
Popular coffee shops have special products, don't they?  
That's why this is a trial product.  
The special product of the coffee shop I might open one day.  
  
**Guda**: So, you would like me to taste test it? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Eh? No, um, that's not what I meant...  
  
**Guda**: How about a coffee shop with cats in it? (Option 2)
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Wha!? A cat coffee shop...that's a truly wonderful idea.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I wanted you to be the first one to eat these.  
I, who came from another world, might disappear from here one day.  
That's why, I'll take the memories of us together with me.
  
**Guda**: Let's make a lot of memories. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...! Geez, saying that with a look on your face as if this was the most natural thing in the world...  
Make sure you reserve that for me only.  
  
**Guda**: We might meet in another world, after all. (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: How shocking... You believe my story?  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: But yeah, it might be like you say.  
Chance meetings or being reborn; I can't say I dislike such dream-like subjects at all.  
...Now then, it's about time.  
  
**Guda**: What do you mean? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Meeting you today was a bit of a miracle.  
  
**Guda**: So it's like that after all? (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: You really should reconsider taking everything others say at face value.  
&nbsp;  
The coffee shop disappears.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Well then, in this moment that might come one day  
──────Let us meet again.

#[Meow-Meow Choco (Provisional)](https://static.atlasacademy.io/JP/CharaGraph/9809750/9809750a.png)

Valentines's chocolate from Kawakami Gensai.
&nbsp;  
Chocolate shaped like cute cats. There is no need to hide anything: these are the prototype of what she intends to use as the special products of the coffee shop she's thinking of opening in the future. Already making trial products when nobody knows what the future holds is pretty out there, but Gensai-chan is very much sane and serious about this. They're plain and simply well-made.  
&nbsp;  
But be careful. It might be called Meow-Meow Choco (Provisional), but chocolate must not be fed to cats under any circumstances.  
&nbsp;  
Mh...in that case the cat coffee shop plan and these trial products might not be a good match. Let's consider this a future challenge to overcome.

1r3v6wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1r3v6wz/ive_lived_the_same_five_years_over_and_over_it/,I’ve lived the same five years over and over. It always ends the same way. Part 1,"The first time it happened, I thought it was a nervous breakdown with a flair for theatrics.

I was thirty-two, sitting in a Honda dealership off Route 17, signing paperwork I didn’t need to sign. A pen on a counter. Fluorescent lights that made everyone’s skin look slightly gray. A salesman with a forced laugh and a tie that kept drifting crooked like it hated being there too. I had spent the last ten minutes arguing—calmly, politely, like I was ordering a sandwich—that I didn’t want a “protection package” and that no, I wasn’t paying extra for floor mats that came with the car anyway.

I’d done this before.

Not in the normal way—like “I bought a car once” before. I mean every word, every pause, every little motion of his hand when he tapped the brochure had already been in my body. Like my muscles remembered.

My stomach turned over, slow and heavy, because I realized I could predict what he’d say next.

“Listen,” he was saying, “I’m just trying to take care of you. People don’t think about… you know. What if—”

“What if a deer runs into the side of it,” I finished, at the exact same time he did, and he blinked at me like I’d reached into his mouth and pulled the sentence out.

He laughed. “Man, you must sell cars.”

I didn’t. I worked in inventory for a warehouse that shipped medical supplies. Or… I had. I couldn’t even tell, in that moment, if that was still true.

I dropped the pen. It clacked against the counter and rolled. The sound felt too loud in the little office.

In the window, between the glossy poster of a smiling couple and the row of cars outside, I saw my reflection.

I looked normal. Tired. Stubble I should’ve shaved. A scar at the edge of my eyebrow from a bike accident when I was nine. Same guy.

So why did my heart feel like it was running from something?

I pushed the paperwork away.

“I can’t,” I said.

The salesman’s smile faltered. “Can’t what?”

“I can’t do this.” My throat tightened, because I realized what I meant wasn’t “I can’t buy the car.” It was everything. The whole day. The whole week. The whole stretch of time my brain was insisting had already happened.

I stood up too fast. The chair scraped.

The salesman started talking again—something about deposits and financing—but his voice blurred, because I heard something else. Not in the dealership. Not through the wall. Something that wasn’t a sound so much as a pressure behind my ears.

A countdown.

Not numbers spoken out loud. Just a sense of time snapping into place like a trap being set.

Five years.

That phrase hit me out of nowhere, sharp as a slap.

Five years and then it comes.

I left without explaining. I walked out into the lot and the air felt like winter even though it was April. The sky was that flat, overcast gray that makes everything look like it’s waiting.

I got into my car—my old car, the one with the cracked dash—and my hands were shaking so badly I had to sit there and breathe.

That was Cycle One, I guess. The one where I still believed in normal explanations.

I went to a doctor. I did scans. I took pills. I did therapy. I avoided caffeine. I did everything you do when your brain starts betraying you.

And then, five years later, it found me.

I’m not telling you “five years later” like it was a neat little skip. I lived those five years. I aged through them. I watched my hairline change in the mirror and I felt the dull ache in my knees when it rained. I made friends. I lost touch with people. I paid bills. I watched shows. I had a relationship that ended because we wanted different things and she cried in my kitchen and I stood there holding a dish towel like it could save me.

The world didn’t feel fake. That’s the part that screws with you. It wasn’t a dream you wake up from. It was life. Regular, boring, stupid life.

Until the last day.

It was a Tuesday. I know because I’d been annoyed I had to work late and I’d promised myself I’d start meal prepping on Wednesdays. I stopped at a Sunoco after work—the kind with the little convenience store that sells hot dogs that have been turning on metal rollers for hours. I bought a coffee even though it tasted like burned plastic, and the receipt printed with that thin heat-paper font that fades if you leave it in your car.

I remember the stupid detail because later I tried to keep one. I tried to prove it to myself.

When I walked out, my car wouldn’t start. The engine turned over and then quit, like it was choking.

I tried again. Same thing.

I sat there with the key in my hand, staring at my dashboard lights.

And I knew. Not guessed. Knew.

Because that same pressure behind my ears was back, stronger now, like the air itself was leaning in.

It’s here.

I got out of the car. The parking lot was mostly empty. A guy in a hoodie was walking into the store. Two semis idled by the pumps, their engines rumbling low.

Nothing looked wrong. No storm. No sirens. No dramatic build.

Then I saw it across the street, on the edge of the woods that bordered the highway.

At first my brain refused to label it. It was too tall, too thin, too wrong to be a person.

It stepped out from between the trees like it had been waiting politely for me to notice.

Ten feet, at least. Maybe more. Emaciated in a way that didn’t look like starvation so much as something had pulled it apart and forgot to put it back together. Its arms were too long, hanging almost to its knees. Its chest was a narrow cage. Its skin was pale and stretched tight over bone like shrink wrap over leftovers.

No clothes. No hair. No eyes.

Just smooth skin where eye sockets should’ve been, like someone had pressed them flat.

And a mouth.

A long, grinning mouth that cut across its face. Not a smile like a person. A grin like a rip. The lips were thin, cracked, and pulled back far enough that I saw teeth that looked too many and too small, like a row of broken piano keys.

It didn’t move fast. It didn’t need to.

It tilted its head slightly, as if listening, and then it started walking toward the gas station.

Straight line. No hesitation.

A man with a normal brain would’ve screamed. I didn’t. I stood there with coffee in my hand, frozen, because a chunk of me kept insisting it was impossible.

Then it crossed the road without looking for cars, stepping between moving vehicles like it knew they wouldn’t hit it. A pickup swerved and honked. The driver leaned out the window to yell something and then slammed on the brakes, not because he wanted to, but because his body decided for him.

He stared.

The creature didn’t look at him. Didn’t even turn its head.

It just kept coming for me.

I dropped my coffee. The cup hit the ground and splashed dark liquid across the concrete.

And I ran.

I ran behind the convenience store, past a dumpster that smelled like sour milk and fryer grease, and I kept going, because there was nowhere else to go. I heard footsteps behind me—not heavy, not pounding, just a steady, soft slap like bare feet on wet pavement.

The thing didn’t breathe. I didn’t hear panting. I didn’t hear effort.

I cut around the side of the building, sprinted into the lot, and almost collided with the guy in the hoodie. His eyes went wide at my face and he stepped back like I had blood on me.

“I need help,” I said. My voice came out too high, almost childish. “Call—call someone. Call the police.”

He started reaching for his phone, but then his gaze flicked over my shoulder.

His hand froze.

Whatever he saw behind me drained the color from his face like someone had pulled a plug.

He didn’t run. He didn’t scream. He just stood there, phone halfway out of his pocket, staring.

The creature reached us, and it didn’t lunge or swipe like an animal.

It simply stepped closer, and the air around it felt thinner. Like oxygen got distracted.

My knees softened. I stumbled backward. The world narrowed to the shape of its mouth and the empty, eyeless skin above it.

It leaned down. Not to smell me. Not to whisper.

Just leaned down like you lean in to read a label.

And then—

There’s a gap in my memory there. Not because I blacked out. Because the next thing that happened wasn’t “the next thing.” It was the beginning.

I woke up on a different morning, in a different bed, with a different phone buzzing on the nightstand.

I sat up so fast I got dizzy.

Outside the window, sunlight. Birds. A normal day.

My phone’s lock screen showed a date.

Five years earlier.

I laughed out loud, one short bark, because my brain couldn’t decide if that was relief or hysteria.

I checked my reflection in the bathroom mirror and saw I was five years younger again. The tiny lines near my eyes were gone. My shoulders didn’t ache when I moved.

I stood there gripping the sink so hard my knuckles went white, and I understood something that felt too big to fit into words.

It reset.

Five years, and then it resets.

And it comes for me at the end.

I don’t know if it’s infinite. I don’t know if there’s a number where it stops. I just know I keep waking up at the start, and I keep hoping one of these mornings will be the last time.

That was when I started keeping notes.

Not a journal in the poetic sense. A system. Lists. Hard dates. Things only I would know so I couldn’t talk myself out of it later.

In one cycle, I set up a Gmail draft to myself with a subject line I’d never write by accident: “READ THIS FIRST: FIVE-YEAR RESET / EYELSS \\\\\\\[sic\\\\\\\] GIANT.” I left the typo on purpose. I attached a photo of my own face and circled my scar with a red markup tool like a lunatic. I wrote down the dealership moment, the coffee taste, the hoodie guy’s frozen hand.

When the reset happened, that draft didn’t exist. The account wasn’t logged in. The phone was a different model. The typo never got to exist.

That’s when I learned the rule that keeps ruining every “proof” plan:

The loop doesn’t preserve my tools.

It preserves me.

The world rearranges around my decisions. Like a slot machine that spins the same reels but stops on different symbols.

One cycle, I stayed in my warehouse job. Another cycle, I quit on impulse and went back to school. I became a teacher for three years, teaching ninth grade English in a school that smelled like pencil shavings and cafeteria pizza. I had a classroom. A desk. Students who made jokes and complained about essays. I thought, in that cycle, maybe being around kids—being grounded—would stop the spiral in my head.

It didn’t.

At the end of that cycle, it found me in the school parking lot.

It was winter. Snow piled against the curbs in dirty gray slabs. I’d stayed late grading papers, the building mostly empty except for the custodian pushing a mop bucket down the hall, humming under his breath. I walked out with my bag slung over my shoulder, thinking about whether I was going to stop at ShopRite.

I saw it standing by my car like it belonged there.

No eyes. That grin.

The snow around its feet was melted in a perfect oval, like heat radiated off it, but its skin looked cold.

I dropped my bag and tried to run back into the building.

The door wouldn’t open.

Not locked. Not stuck. It was like the handle wasn’t connected to anything. Like the building had decided I didn’t get to go inside.

The custodian’s humming stopped.

I turned my head and saw him at the end of the hallway through the glass, staring at me. Staring past me. His mouth was slightly open.

He didn’t move to help.

The creature stepped closer.

Reset.

Another cycle, I did the thing I never thought I’d do: I turned my life into content.

I became an influencer. I hate even typing that word, because it makes me sound like a joke, and honestly, that cycle was my worst five years in terms of dignity.

I started with fitness videos because it was easy to sell. People want transformation. People want simple routines. People want someone to tell them the secret is discipline and a powder you can buy from my link.

I sold protein powder. I sold “wellness stacks.” I posed with tubs of supplements like they were trophies. I took pictures in gyms with good lighting and pretended my confidence was natural.

I made money. That’s the gross part. It worked.

By year three, I had a small following. People recognized me at grocery stores and asked if I was “that guy.” My DMs were full of strangers calling me “king” and asking what brand of blender I used.

I thought maybe if I became a different enough person, the thing wouldn’t recognize me.

At the end of that cycle, it found me anyway.

It came during a livestream.

I was in my apartment, ring light on, camera angled just right, talking about “mindset” like I was qualified to talk about anything.

I noticed the comments slow down.

Not stop. Slow, like people were distracted by something off-screen.

Someone typed: bro wtf is behind you

I glanced at the chat, smiled like it was a joke, and turned my head.

In the reflection of the dark TV screen behind me, I saw it standing in my hallway.

Tall enough its head nearly brushed the ceiling.

No eyes.

That grin.

I lunged for my phone, knocked it off the tripod, and the live feed spun, showing carpet, showing my bare feet, showing my hand scrabbling for the device like it was going to save me.

I heard no footsteps. Just that steady, soft slap.

Then the phone camera caught a glimpse of it as it stepped over the fallen tripod.

Chat exploded. People screaming in text. Emojis. “IS THIS REAL” and “CALL 911” and “THIS IS SICK.”

I screamed for the first time in any cycle, raw and ugly, because there was no pretending now.

The last thing I remember before the reset was its mouth opening wider than it should’ve been able to, like the grin was a door.

Then the world snapped back to the beginning.

After enough cycles, you stop trying “normal” fixes.

I tried the big solutions.

In one cycle, I got rich on purpose. Not influencer rich. Real rich. I made a series of investments that, after enough loops, I learned how to time. I bought before spikes. I sold before crashes. I played the system like I had a cheat code because I did.

By year four, I had enough money to hire people who normally don’t answer emails from someone like me.

Scientists. Researchers. Private labs. A neurologist who smelled like expensive cologne and didn’t believe me until I predicted a freak hailstorm down to the hour.

I flew them out to a rented house in the mountains. Two physicists, a neuroscientist, a guy who worked in some government-adjacent lab and kept asking me where my funding came from.

They recorded everything.

They monitored my sleep. They asked about toxins. They took blood samples. They talked about time dilation and quantum branching and the idea that reality could be a series of decision trees.

One of them—the neuroscientist, Dr. Khan—sat across from me at a long dining table one night and said, “Even if we confirm you’re in a loop, that doesn’t mean we can alter it. We might only be passengers.”

“I don’t need you to alter it,” I said. “I need you to tell me what it is. And what that thing is.”

His face tightened. “You keep calling it a ‘thing.’”

“Because if I call it a man, I’ll throw up.”

They tried to set traps. They tried to find patterns. They tried to locate it early in the cycle.

We never saw it until the end.

It was like it didn’t exist until it did.

The last month of that cycle, they moved me into a reinforced facility rented from a company that specializes in “secure storage.” Concrete walls. Steel doors. Cameras. Motion sensors. Armed guards who thought they were protecting a rich guy from kidnapping.

I sat in a chair in the center of the main room with electrodes on my scalp and watched the camera feeds, waiting for the countdown pressure to start.

It did.

The guards kept joking about it, like nervous men do.

Then every camera went to static at once.

Not one. All of them.

The lights didn’t flicker. They stayed on. The power was fine. The cameras simply stopped showing reality.

The steel door at the far end of the corridor—the one that was rated to withstand a truck slamming into it—made a sound.

Not a bang. Not a crash.

A soft, deliberate scrape, like fingernails on metal.

Then the door opened.

Not blown open. Not pried open. It swung inward like someone had turned the handle.

It stepped into the corridor, ducking its head slightly to clear the frame.

No eyes. That grin.

One guard fired. The gunshots were deafening in the confined space. The smell of gunpowder filled the air so fast it made my eyes water.

The bullets hit it. I saw them strike skin. I saw the way its flesh dented and then smoothed.

It didn’t bleed.

It didn’t flinch.

It didn’t even turn its head toward the shooter.

It just kept walking toward me.

The guards’ screams were the worst part, because they weren’t brave-soldier screams. They were human animal noise. Panic. Disbelief.

I tried to run. I got maybe three steps before my legs went weak like someone had turned off the signal to my muscles.

It stopped in front of me.

Dr. Khan shouted something behind me, but his voice sounded far away, like he was underwater.

The creature leaned down again, close enough I smelled it.

Not rot. Not death.

Something dry. Like dust in an old attic. Like paper left in the sun.

Its mouth opened.

Reset.

After that, I tried spiritual.

One was a woman outside Santa Fe.

I remember her because she didn’t act impressed. She didn’t act greedy. She didn’t act like I’d handed her a story she could monetize.

She acted tired.

Her place was a one-story adobe-looking house with a chain-link fence and a yard full of scrubby plants that looked like they survived out of spite. Inside, the air smelled like dry sage and hot dust. No incense fog. No dramatic candles everywhere. Just one table in the center of a room with a packed dirt floor and a ceiling fan that squeaked on every rotation.

She introduced herself as Marisol. She was maybe late fifties, hair braided back, hands stained with something dark that could’ve been dye or soil. She watched me sit down like she was already measuring how fast I’d run.

I told her the truth. All of it. The five years. The reset. The thing.

She didn’t interrupt. She didn’t smile. She didn’t lean in.

When I finished, she said, “Describe its face.”

“No eyes,” I said. “Just skin. Smooth. And a mouth. A grin.”

“How tall.”

“Ten feet. Taller. Like it shouldn’t fit through doors, but it does.”

Marisol nodded once, like that checked a box she didn’t like.

She got up, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a shallow bowl. In the bowl was a gray powder that looked like ash, and a small glass vial with a cork.

She came back and set them on the table.

“Blood,” she said.

I stared at her.

“I’m not asking you because it’s dramatic,” she said. “I’m asking because if you don’t give it willingly, something else will take it.”

She slid a thin craft razor across the table.

I cut my palm shallow. Blood welled, dark and glossy.

Marisol held the bowl steady. “Let it fall.”

I let three drops fall into the ash.

The ash absorbed it like thirsty dirt.

Marisol poured the contents of the vial—clear liquid—into the bowl. The ash turned into a paste, thick and gray, with tiny red streaks.

She dipped two fingers into it and drew a circle on the table, right between us. Not a fancy symbol. Just a plain ring.

Then she looked up at me and said, “This isn’t a curse.”

“What is it,” I whispered.

“It’s a boundary,” she said. “You’re hitting the same boundary over and over.”

“A boundary with what?”

“With something that owns the end of you.”

My skin went cold. “That thing—”

“It’s not chasing you because it hates you,” she said. “It’s chasing you because it’s what comes next.”

“Can you stop it.”

Marisol stared at the circle she’d drawn like she didn’t want to touch it again.

“No,” she said. “But I can ask a question.”

“What question.”

She pressed her fingers to the ring of paste and whispered under her breath. Spanish, maybe, mixed with words I didn’t recognize. Flat, controlled, like she was reading a receipt.

The ceiling fan squeaked overhead.

My ears popped.

Not in the normal pressure way. Sharper. Like someone shoved a finger into both ear canals at the same time.

Marisol stopped mid-whisper. Her face blanched. She lifted her hand from the circle and stared at her fingers.

The paste on them was drying too fast, cracking like old mud.

She met my eyes and said, “It heard.”

My heart slammed. “Who heard?”

Marisol stood so fast her chair scraped. “Get out.”

“What—Marisol, what did you—”

“Get out,” she snapped, voice rising for the first time. “Leave my house.”

I stood, dizzy. “Is it coming now?”

“No,” she said, and the way she said it made it worse. “But you just made it aware that you’re trying.”

“But you said it isn’t aware.”

Marisol’s eyes flicked to the hallway behind me, then back to my face. “It doesn’t remember cycles,” she said. “That’s not the same thing.”

“What did I do.”

“You knocked,” she said. “And something on the other side moved.”

I left. I remember my shoes crunching grit on her porch. I remember the sun feeling too bright. I remember getting into my rental car and sitting there with my hands on the wheel until my knuckles hurt.

I never went back.

At the end of that cycle, it still came.

Now, you might be asking what the “beginning” is. What moment starts the five years.

It’s always normal.

Not a lab. Not lightning. Not a monster sighting.

I wake up on a morning that feels like any other. Different bed sometimes. Different apartment sometimes. Different city once.

But the same me.

And the same sense, like there’s a script I’m supposed to follow that I keep messing up.

The only consistent thing is the pressure behind my ears when the end gets close. It starts faint about a week out—like a headache that comes and goes. Then it gets stronger, and stronger, until it feels like the air itself is squeezing.

This cycle, it started earlier.

That’s why I’m posting now.

In the first month of each cycle, I will see—somewhere, somehow—a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

Sometimes he’s on a sidewalk. Sometimes he’s in a grocery store line. Sometimes he’s crossing a parking lot.

He always looks like he’s in a hurry. He always glances at me like he recognizes me, then looks away like he decided he doesn’t.

In the current cycle, I saw him at a Target in Paramus, three months in. Notebook aisle. Clearance stickers. He looked right at me and his expression did something small and ugly—pity, maybe—and then he disappeared into the crowd.

That’s how normal it stays.

Until it doesn’t.

This week, I started preparing like I always do, even though it has never worked.

Energy drinks. Protein bars. A first-aid kit. Running shoes.

And a body camera.

Last night I tested it by recording myself in my kitchen saying the date out loud and holding up today’s mail. When I played it back, everything looked fine except for a thin line of static across the top of the frame that only showed up near the end of the clip.

This morning, I woke up with dried blood under my nose.

I checked the date. I counted days.

Five.

This afternoon, I was walking past the laundromat with the broken “OPEN” sign. The air smelled like dryer exhaust and stale detergent. A TV inside played a daytime talk show too loud. I stopped at the crosswalk because the light was red.

A woman stood next to me with two grocery bags. She looked tired. She kept adjusting her grip like the handles were digging into her fingers.

Behind us, a car idled, bass thumping so low it vibrated the air.

Everything was normal.

Then the woman beside me went rigid.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t turn around dramatically. She just went still, like her muscles locked.

I glanced at her face. Her eyes were wide. She was staring across the street.

Her lips moved.

“What…” she whispered.

I turned my head.

Across the street, between a parked delivery van and the brick wall of a closed bank, there was a narrow gap of shadow that shouldn’t have been that dark in daylight.

In that shadow, something tall shifted.

It wasn’t fully there. Not the way it is at the end. It was like the outline of it was trying to form, and the air was resisting.

But I saw long arms.

Pale skin.

And the mouth.

That long, grinning cut of teeth, hovering in the dark like a smear of white.

The woman stumbled backward. Grocery bags slipped from her hands. A jar of pasta sauce shattered on the concrete. Red splashed like an accident.

The car behind us honked, impatient.

The thing in the shadow moved forward an inch.

My ears popped—hard—like someone shoved pressure into my skull and twisted. Pain flashed down my jaw. My vision narrowed. The street tilted.

I clapped a hand to my right ear and felt warm wetness.

Blood.

My hearing in that ear dropped to a muffled roar, like I’d gone underwater.

That’s new. That’s the cost.

And for the first time, it didn’t feel like the loop was waiting for the last day.

It felt like I’d just touched something I wasn’t supposed to touch.

I ran.

I sprinted down the street, past the vape shop and the nail salon and the pizza place with the greasy smell. I heard someone shout after me.

I made it back to my apartment building and slammed through the front door, nearly shoulder-checking an old man coming out. He cursed at me. I didn’t stop.

I took the stairs two at a time, my right ear ringing so loud it drowned out everything, and got inside my apartment, locking the deadbolt, then the chain like it was going to matter.

I stood in my living room, chest heaving, and waited.

The pressure in my head didn’t ease.

I walked to my window and looked down at the street.

Across the street, by the bank, a small crowd had gathered.

They were pointing at the gap between the van and the wall. Some had their phones out.

And in the middle of them, standing completely still, was a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

He wasn’t looking at the shadow.

He was looking up.

At my window.

His face wasn’t confused or curious.

It was flat. Like he’d been waiting for this.

He raised his free hand and made a small motion.

Come down.

Or maybe: you shouldn’t have run.

Then he turned and walked away into the crowd, disappearing like he’d never been there.

I looked back at the gap of shadow.

Nothing.

No mouth. No outline. Just daylight and brick and the side of a van.

But the woman’s jar of sauce was still broken on the sidewalk.

The people were still pointing like they couldn’t stop themselves.

My right ear was still bleeding, slow and warm.

I clipped the body camera to my chest and pressed the button until the tiny red light came on.

The muffled roar in my right ear hasn’t stopped.

And I can hear bare feet in my hallway now.

Soft. Steady.

Close enough that when I hold my breath, I can tell exactly where the sound is stopping.",1,1771003291.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1r3v3rl,https://www.splitthedistance.com,"Split The Distance — major update: find the midpoint for up to 5 people, plan road trip stops along your route, and see a fairness zone instead of a single pin","Hey everyone — some of you may remember **Split The Distance** from an earlier post. It's a free tool that finds the midpoint between two locations based on actual drive time (not just a pin on a map).

Given the success and huge interest from visitors we've been having, we wanted to provide an update on a major release we shipped today and share what's new:

**Group Search (3-5 people)**

You can now find the optimal meeting point for up to 5 people. Enter everyone's locations and it calculates the spot that minimizes drive time for the whole group. Great for family reunions, friend weekends, or anyone trying to coordinate across multiple cities.

**Road Trip Stops**

For longer drives, you can now plan stops along your route at regular intervals — every 60, 90, or 120 minutes, or every 50/100 miles. Each stop shows nearby food, coffee, parks, gas, etc. It basically turns a long drive into a planned itinerary.

**Drift Radius (Fairness Zone)**

Instead of a single midpoint pin, you can toggle on a shaded circle that shows a ""fairness zone"" — the area where drive times are roughly equal for both people. All place results filter to within that zone.

**Other new stuff:**

* **Toggle between drive-time** midpoint and **distance-based midpoint**
* **Drive, bike, or walk modes** (bike/walk auto-restrict for long distances)
* **Midpoint Roulette** — can't decide? Hit ""Surprise Me"" and we pick a random spot
* **Search history** so you can re-run past searches with one tap
* **Local Only filter** to hide chain restaurants

The core tool is completely **free** — no account needed. Creating an account (also free) unlocks a few extras like Roulette and search history. There's a premium tier for power features like Road Trip Mode and Drift Radius.

Would love to hear what you think or if there's anything that would make it more useful for you.",0,1771003095.0,InternetIsBeautiful,4,0.45,False

Matched with a foreign lady who just moved to my country for work.

She works as a recruiter in a recruiting companymas per her bio. Claims to look for a LTR with suitable values.

I did find something's iffy about her:

1. Very friendly and enthusiastic in messages. I appreciate some enthusiasm but being overly friendly and enthusiastic for the first few messages is a bit unusual. Or maybe I'm more reserved and guarded.
2. Trying to find a LTR when you just moved to a foreign country is strange. Like you don't even know whether you will be staying for the long-term.
3. States that she wants to discover more of my country. Wants to visit this park or other local attractions. I'm flattered and while men appreciate women who take the initiative, suggesting which local attraction you want to go on a first date feels a bit weird, where it should be a simple coffee date or meal to assess compatibility and then museum dates later.
4. Her replies are always at 11pm--1am local time even though I messaged her in the early morningat around 8am. Unless she is working in a job that works long shift, which a recruiter does not, even with long hours, replying at around 11pm - 12am signals very low priority or sus.

**Kawakami Gensai**: Why are you so...  
However, I can't listen to that request of yours. If I say I'll do something, I'll definitely carry it out.  
I won't let anyone get in the way of what I've decided on.

**Guda**: That's not true at all (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I see...it makes me happy even if you just said it as flattery.  
  
**Guda**: I like you though (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ! ...Don't say something like that all of a sudden.  
  
**Cat**: Meow meow!  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Sorry, but there's no more catnip.  
...That's not it?  
Are you letting me hold you in my arms, by any chance?  
  
**Cat**: Meow.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Is that so...thank you.  
Then I won't hesitate.  
&nbsp;  
Gensai cradles the cat.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ... (inhales)  
Phew...this is very calming...  
I've been quite fond of this kitty every since I first saw them.  
It wouldn't let me approach it at all before, but it seems like today is special.  
  
**Cat**: Meow.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...You're leaving already?  
&nbsp;  
Gensai sets the cat down.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Then, I'll see you later.  
  
**Cat**: Meow~  
&nbsp;  
The cat leaves.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Hey, how does it feel to be liked by others?  
The people around you trust and care for you.  
  
**Guda**: Do they? ...Guess they might. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Not might, they definitely do. For sure.  
  
**Guda**: I don't really understand it myself. (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I'm astounded...to think you weren't even aware of it.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I want to be liked by cats so I might be a little envious of you.  
........  
Thank you for keeping me company.  
Come, let us return.  
Also, this is not all I wanted your time for.  
  
**Guda**: What business did you have with me? (Option 1)
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: What, you ask...  
  
**Guda**: It wasn't just the cat? (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: It wasn't the cat.  
Well, I can't say it had nothing to with them.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Don't worry about it and let's just go.  
&nbsp;  
We enter a coffee shop.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Thank you for waiting, goshujin-sama.  
  
**Guda**: What are you trying to start? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Fufu, no need to panic...  
  
**Guda**: Goshujin-sama's a bit... (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Is that so? But this is what a maid's etiquette dictates.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Now, let us begin.  
Ahem...  
Welcome to my establishment, dear guest of mine.  
Today is Valentine's Day.  
A special day comes with special service.  
So I've prepared something for my precious guest.  
&nbsp;  
Gensai hands over cat-shaped cookies.  
&nbsp;  
**Guda**: Thank you. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Fufu...I'm glad they made you happy.  
  
**Guda**: These are shaped like the faces of cats...  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Yes, I tried to make them look like that kitty.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ........  
Actually, these chocolates were made by me. What do you think?  
Have I told you before? My dream is to open a coffee shop.  
No, it might not be a dream, but something that has happened somewhere.  
It might also be an event that hasn't happened yet.  
I don't remember it well, but it's surely something along those lines.  
........  
Popular coffee shops have special products, don't they?  
That's why this is a trial product.  
The special product of the coffee shop I might open one day.  
  
**Guda**: So, you would like me to taste test it? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Eh? No, um, that's not what I meant...  
  
**Guda**: How about a coffee shop with cats in it? (Option 2)
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Wha!? A cat coffee shop...that's a truly wonderful idea.  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: I wanted you to be the first one to eat these.  
I, who came from another world, might disappear from here one day.  
That's why, I'll take the memories of us together with me.
  
**Guda**: Let's make a lot of memories. (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: ...! Geez, saying that with a look on your face as if this was the most natural thing in the world...  
Make sure you reserve that for me only.  
  
**Guda**: We might meet in another world, after all. (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: How shocking... You believe my story?  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: But yeah, it might be like you say.  
Chance meetings or being reborn; I can't say I dislike such dream-like subjects at all.  
...Now then, it's about time.  
  
**Guda**: What do you mean? (Option 1)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Meeting you today was a bit of a miracle.  
  
**Guda**: So it's like that after all? (Option 2)  
  
**Kawakami Gensai**: You really should reconsider taking everything others say at face value.  
&nbsp;  
The coffee shop disappears.  
&nbsp;  
**Kawakami Gensai**: Well then, in this moment that might come one day  
──────Let us meet again.

#[Meow-Meow Choco (Provisional)](https://static.atlasacademy.io/JP/CharaGraph/9809750/9809750a.png)

Valentines's chocolate from Kawakami Gensai.
&nbsp;  
Chocolate shaped like cute cats. There is no need to hide anything: these are the prototype of what she intends to use as the special products of the coffee shop she's thinking of opening in the future. Already making trial products when nobody knows what the future holds is pretty out there, but Gensai-chan is very much sane and serious about this. They're plain and simply well-made.  
&nbsp;  
But be careful. It might be called Meow-Meow Choco (Provisional), but chocolate must not be fed to cats under any circumstances.  
&nbsp;  
Mh...in that case the cat coffee shop plan and these trial products might not be a good match. Let's consider this a future challenge to overcome.

The vibes are better just because you’re not stressed and feeling rushed or with a ton of strangers. Just one on one with a home service provider.

1r3uz13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r3uz13/how_to_be_disgustingly_attractive_in_2025_the/,How to Be Disgustingly Attractive in 2025: The Psychology-Backed Playbook Nobody Talks About,"Okay so I've been down a DEEP rabbit hole for the past few months, consuming everything from evolutionary psychology research to pickup artist podcasts (yes I know, cringe, but bear with me). And here's what nobody's telling you about attraction: 99% of the advice out there is either obvious bullshit or actively making you less attractive.



The whole ""just be yourself"" thing? Partially terrible advice. The gym bro obsession with getting massive? Diminishing returns after a point. The fashion advice that makes you dress like you're cosplaying a CEO? Often counterproductive.



I've synthesized insights from behavioral science, dating apps analytics, therapy sessions I totally didn't eavesdrop on at coffee shops, and yeah, some actually useful relationship podcasts. This isn't recycled ""shower daily"" garbage. This is the uncomfortable stuff that actually moves the needle.



1. become genuinely interesting, not instagram interesting



Real talk: most people are boring as hell. They consume the same content, have the same opinions, live the same routines. Attraction isn't about looking good in photos, it's about being someone others want to spend actual time with.



Develop at least two unusual skills or knowledge bases. Not ""I can play wonderwall on guitar"" basic. More like learning lockpicking, studying mycology, getting obsessed with brutalist architecture, mastering traditional breadmaking. Something that makes people go ""wait what"" when you mention it.



Matthew Hussey's podcast ""[Love Life](https://open.spotify.com/show/2acKIpH0hrcGl0P8sU2Avj)"" has this episode about ""creating intellectual foreplay"" that absolutely nailed this concept. He talks about how the most attractive people aren't necessarily the smartest, they're the ones who can make any topic fascinating through genuine enthusiasm and unique perspectives. Insanely good framework for thinking about conversations.



2. fix your emotional regulation before anything else



Here's the thing nobody wants to hear: if you're emotionally volatile, needy, or can't handle basic stress without melting down, no amount of physical attractiveness will save you. I'm talking about that thing where something minor happens and you spiral, or you need constant validation, or you can't be alone with your thoughts for 30 minutes.



The Ash app changed my entire perspective on this. It's basically a relationship and mental health coach in your pocket that helps you identify anxious attachment patterns, emotional triggers, and gives you actual tools to regulate yourself. The ""conflict resolution"" modules are chef's kiss for learning how to handle disagreements without becoming either a doormat or an asshole. Game changer for becoming someone people feel safe around.



Emotional stability isn't sexy in an Instagram way, but it's deeply attractive in a ""I could actually build a life with this person"" way. And trust me, people subconsciously screen for this HARD.



3. develop actual social intelligence



Most people think they're socially intelligent. Most people are wrong. Real social intelligence means reading microexpressions, understanding group dynamics, knowing when to lead versus when to support, calibrating your energy to different contexts.



""[The Like Switch](https://archive.org/details/likeswitchexfbia0000scha)"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI behavior analyst) breaks down the actual psychology of likability and influence. This book will make you question everything you think you know about first impressions and relationship building. Schafer worked on getting foreign spies to defect, so yeah, he knows a thing or two about becoming attractive to others. The section on friendship signals and how to deploy them naturally is worth the price alone.



For anyone wanting to go deeper into social psychology without grinding through academic papers, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts. You type in specific goals like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" and it pulls from psychology research, expert insights, and books like Schafer's to create personalized audio lessons. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your progress, and you get a virtual coach that responds to questions mid-lesson. Makes internalizing this stuff way more structured than randomly consuming content.



Practice this: in every social situation, try to make one person feel genuinely seen and appreciated. Not in a fake way, but actually paying attention to what they care about and reflecting it back. This builds a reputation that precedes you.



4. master your vocal tonality and body language



Your ideas can be brilliant but if you deliver them like an anxious chipmunk or a monotone robot, nobody's listening. Vocal tonality conveys confidence, warmth, status, literally everything that determines whether people want to be around you.



[Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/charismaoncommand) (YouTube channel) has breakdowns of actors, comedians, and public figures that will rewire how you think about nonverbal communication. Their analysis of Chris Hemsworth's humor or Margot Robbie's interview presence shows you exactly what makes certain people magnetic. Binge their celebrity breakdowns and you'll start noticing patterns you can adopt.



Also: slow down your speech by like 20%. Most people talk too fast when nervous. Slower speech signals confidence and makes people actually listen.



5. become genuinely kind in a world of performative niceness



There's fake nice (people pleasing, conflict avoidance, desperate for approval) and there's genuine kindness (having strong boundaries but treating people with respect, helping without expecting reciprocation, being honest even when it's uncomfortable).



Attractive people are kind but not pushovers. They'll tell you the truth you need to hear, they'll set boundaries clearly, they'll call out bullshit, but they do it without cruelty. This is incredibly rare and incredibly magnetic.



Practical: do one anonymous good deed weekly. Tip extra when nobody's watching. Help someone who can't do anything for you. This builds genuine kindness as a character trait, not a tactic.



6. optimize your lifestyle for energy, not aesthetics



Everyone's obsessed with looking good but walks around exhausted, brain fogged, running on caffeine and spite. You know what's actually attractive? Someone who's genuinely energetic and present.



Sort out your sleep (non negotiable), fix your diet (not for abs, for sustained energy), move your body daily (for mental clarity more than physique), manage your stress (meditation, therapy, whatever works). The Finch app is weirdly effective for building these habits through their cute bird companion thing. Sounds dumb, works incredibly well for tracking mood patterns and identifying what actually affects your energy.



When you're operating at high energy, everything else becomes easier. Your social skills improve, your mood stabilizes, you're funnier, more creative, more resilient. People are drawn to that vitality.



7. develop a distinct personal style



Not fashion, style. There's a difference. Fashion is following trends. Style is knowing yourself well enough to curate an aesthetic that's distinctly you.



This doesn't mean expensive clothes. It means internal congruence. Your environment, your appearance, your interests, how you communicate, it should all feel like it's coming from the same coherent person. People find authenticity and internal alignment incredibly attractive because it's so rare.



Figure out what you actually like, not what you think you should like. Then commit to it unapologetically.



8. become comfortable with desire and rejection



Most people hide their interest because they're terrified of rejection. This makes them come across as either disinterested or deceptive. Attractive people can express interest clearly while also being totally okay if it's not reciprocated.



""Models"" by Mark Manson cuts through all pickup artist garbage and gets to the core: attraction is about vulnerability and honest expression of intent. Manson's framework on polarization (being willing to turn some people off to deeply attract others) is something that actually works in the real world. Best book on dating psychology I've ever encountered, hands down.



Practice stating your preferences and interests clearly. ""I think you're interesting and I'd like to get to know you better"" is infinitely more attractive than games and ambiguity.



Look, none of this is complicated, but it does require consistent effort and genuine self examination. The difference between attractive and unattractive people isn't genetic lottery (though sure, that helps). It's whether you're willing to do the uncomfortable work of developing yourself into someone others actually want to be around.



You're not trying to trick people into liking you. You're becoming the version of yourself that you'd want to spend time with. That's the actual secret.

Wasn't fraud or anything. Just some subscription I'd signed up for last year during one of those phases where you convince yourself this thing is going to change everything. 

My account was fine. I wasn't freaking out. I just stood there staring at my phone while the coffee machine made that hissing noise, feeling kind of annoyed at myself. It wasn't really about the money.

It was more like... so much of my life is on autopay now. Subscriptions, insurance, utilities, cloud storage, random apps I thought I needed. Everything just quietly renews while I'm thinking about other stuff.

And that $119 just felt like proof I've been kind of checked out lately. Not in some crisis way. Just passively letting things happen.

I started thinking about how easy it is to sign up for stuff when you're feeling optimistic. Way harder to actually go back and decide if you still need it. Most of the time I don't even notice the charges unless they're big enough to actually sting.

After that I went through my bank statements and canceled two smaller subscriptions I hadn't touched in months.

Weird how a relatively small amount can make you stop and think like that. I don't think it was really about the $119. It was more the feeling that parts of my life were just running on their own without me paying attention.

I replaced the first nexplanon about a year ago, and I have been dealing with recurring BV for the last 15 months. I've kept using Nexplanon because I no longer get my period, I don't get painful cramps anymore, and it's one of the most effective forms of birth control you can take. However, this recurring BV has made me consider getting off of Nexplanon because it was leading to BV symptoms, and the doctors and gyno I went to didn't really know that Nexplanon increased the risk of BV. I felt embarrassed and anxious because I've never had discharge with such a foul odor and I didn't know what to do or who to ask about this. I have gone to the gyno and PA for my Pap smear and swabs, and by the time I get tested, my symptoms have cleared up. However, the frustrating part was not knowing what caused it and what cleared it up, until now. My main symptoms when I did have BV was having yellow, excessive, and fishy smelling discharge. 

From what I've found online, Nexplanon causes your vaginal mucus to thicken to reduce the chances of sperm surviving, but what most people don't know is that it ""dries"" out your cervix area, which creates an atmosphere that allows for bad bacteria to grow. The dryness makes the vaginas PH more basic (> 5), and no matter how many probiotics you take, if you don't lower the PH, you'll still have an unbalanced flora. For this, you can take probiotic suppositories with hyaluronic acid (HA). If you're taking boric acid, I recommend getting the ones with HA also, and if they feel like they're not working, also check that the boric acid gel capsule is not what's causing a weird smell. 

Other ways to lower your PH is by consuming more vitamin C, which some probiotics already include, vitamin D, and Bromelain (found in pineapples). Vitamin C is acidic and lower vaginal PH, and vitamin D helps lactobacillus survive in vagina. Even though, pineapples are not directly linked to ""changing"" your discharge, they do have enzymes that breakdown that biofilm bacteria creates that makes it difficult to clear up with antibiotics. 

Lastly, stay hydrated, and take all supplements and life style factors into consideration. I have adhd and use Adderall daily, I normally have coffee in the mornings, and i have the nexplanon implant. All three affect my flora, and I've learned the hard way that I need to be on top of all of this. Adderall depletes vitamin c and other nutrients, and it's also a diuretic like coffee. So, no matter how much water I was drinking, low levels of vitamin D and vitamin C, were affecting me. 

TLDR; Nexplanon causes dryness in your hooha, so make sure you're taking some form of vitamin C, vitamin D, bromelain (found in pineapples), probiotics,  and stay hydrated. Also, use suppositories with hyaluronic acid to help reduce dryness. If using gel suppositories, also check that the suppository doesn't create a weird smell. Lastly, vitamin b can cause discharge to turn yellow. ",3,1771002520.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False
1r3uuap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1r3uuap/the_psychology_of_hustle_culture_how_to_spot_when/,"The Psychology of Hustle Culture: How to Spot When Your ""Grind"" Is Actually Self-Destruction","Ever noticed how everyone's suddenly a 4am grinder, cold plunging before sunrise, and optimizing every second like some productivity cyborg? I spent months deep diving into behavioral psychology research, listening to experts like Cal Newport and Andrew Huberman, reading studies on burnout from Stanford's psychology department. What I found was wild. Most of us aren't hustling toward success, we're sprinting toward a spectacular crash. And the scariest part? The warning signs are right there, we just mistake them for dedication.

Here's what actually separates healthy ambition from self destruction that nobody talks about.

Your body is literally screaming at you but you're calling it ""discipline."" When you're constantly exhausted, getting sick more often, or need three coffees just to function like a normal human, that's not a badge of honor. That's your nervous system waving a white flag. Dr. Matthew Walker's research in [Why We Sleep](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/author) breaks down how chronic sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired, it fundamentally rewires your brain's threat detection and emotional regulation. The book won multiple awards and Walker is a UC Berkeley neuroscience professor, but more importantly, this thing completely changed how I viewed rest. Best sleep science book I've ever encountered. You'll realize that every ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" mentality is actually bringing that deadline closer. The data on how sleep deprivation impacts decision making, creativity, and physical health is genuinely terrifying. Around 200 pages of pure evidence that your hustle might be making you dumber, not smarter.

You've stopped doing literally anything that doesn't ""add value."" When was the last time you did something completely pointless? No networking potential, no skill building, no content creation opportunity. Just existing. If you can't remember, that's a problem. Research from Stanford's [d.school](http://d.school) shows that boredom and unstructured time are actually when your brain does its most creative problem solving. But we've been conditioned to feel guilty about rest. Try using the Finch app for habit tracking without the toxic productivity culture. It's this little self care companion that helps you build sustainable routines without making you feel like garbage when you take a day off. The approach is more about gentle consistency than aggressive optimization, which honestly feels revolutionary compared to most productivity tools.

Your relationships have become transactional. Notice how every conversation somehow circles back to work? Or you're mentally calculating if someone is ""worth"" your time based on what they can offer your career? That's not networking, that's emotional bankruptcy. Dr. Robert Waldinger runs Harvard's 85 year study on adult development, and the findings are pretty clear. The quality of your relationships is the strongest predictor of long term happiness and health, not your LinkedIn connections or business cards collected. When your hustle turns every human interaction into a potential deal, you're not building a network, you're building isolation with extra steps.

You're celebrating harm like it's achievement. Skipped lunch to finish a project? Hero. Worked through the weekend? Warrior. Ignored your partner to answer emails at dinner? Dedicated. We've completely normalized treating ourselves like machines. The Huberman Lab podcast has multiple episodes breaking down how chronic stress literally changes your brain structure, particularly around emotional regulation and memory. Your cortisol levels aren't supposed to be permanently elevated. That's not peak performance, that's your body preparing for a threat that never ends. The episodes on stress optimization versus stress addiction are insanely good. They helped me understand the difference between challenging myself and actively destroying my nervous system.

You've lost the plot on why you started. Remember when you wanted financial freedom to spend more time with family? Now you're too busy hustling to see them. Wanted creative autonomy? Now you're algorithmically optimizing content you don't even care about. [Effortless](https://gregmckeown.com/books/effortless/) by Greg McKeown absolutely nails this paradox. McKeown previously wrote ""Essentialism"" which was a massive bestseller, and this follow up explores why our hardest goals shouldn't require the hardest path. It's counterintuitive as hell but the research backs it up. The book challenges every ""no pain no gain"" mentality with actual evidence about sustainable achievement. This is the best productivity book I've read that doesn't make you feel like you need to wake up at 3am to matter. What hit me hardest was realizing that complexity and suffering aren't signs of importance, they're often signs you're doing it wrong.

For those who want a more structured approach to breaking these patterns, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app that pulls from psychology research, productivity experts, and behavioral science to create custom audio learning plans. You can set a goal like ""build sustainable success habits without burnout"" and it generates a roadmap from books like the ones mentioned here, expert interviews, and relevant studies.

What's useful is you control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries when you're low on energy to 40-minute deep dives with examples when you want to go deeper. The voice options are actually addictive, including a sarcastic narrator that makes dense psychology material way more digestible. It's been helpful for connecting dots between concepts without the guilt trip most productivity apps layer on.

Your self worth has become completely tied to output. If you don't produce something today, you feel worthless. Your value as a human is measured by tasks completed, emails sent, content posted. That's not ambition, that's a trauma response dressed up in entrepreneurial language. You're essentially running on a hedonic treadmill where the finish line moves every time you get close. Psychologists call this ""contingent self esteem"" and it's exhausting. The Ash app has been helpful for working through this pattern. It's like having a relationship and mental health coach that helps you identify these toxic thought loops without judgment. The AI conversations actually helped me realize how much of my hustle was compensating for feeling fundamentally inadequate rather than pursuing genuine goals.

Look, I'm not saying ambition is bad or working hard is wrong. But somewhere we crossed from ""pursuing excellence"" into ""performing self destruction."" The culture sells this idea that if you're not constantly grinding, you're losing. That rest is for the weak. That balance is for people who don't want it badly enough. It's bullshit. Sustainable success isn't about maximizing every second, it's about optimizing for the long game. And the long game requires you to still be functional, healthy, and connected to actual humans when you get there. The real flex isn't how much you can endure, it's building something meaningful without destroying yourself in the process.",1,1771002507.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1r3utst,https://www.reddit.com/r/hgh_t/comments/1r3utst/i_fixed_my_morning_energy_without_caffeine_the/,I Fixed My Morning Energy Without Caffeine- The 5-Step Protocol that Actually works,"**I Woke Up Exhausted Every Day For 3 Years - Here's The 5-Step Protocol That Fixed It**

**The Problem (And Why Caffeine Isn't The Answer)**

**My mornings at age 34:**

* Alarm goes off → hit snooze 3 times
* Finally drag myself out of bed feeling like shit
* Immediately make coffee (sometimes double shot)
* Still feel foggy for 2+ hours
* Need another coffee by 11am just to function
* Crash hard around 2pm
* Repeat tomorrow

**I was trapped in the caffeine dependency cycle.**

The caffeine wasn't giving me energy. It was just masking the fact that I had ZERO natural morning energy. And every day, I was digging the hole deeper.

**Two years later (age 36, current):**

* Wake up 5-10 minutes before alarm
* Actually feel refreshed
* Mental clarity within 20 minutes
* Sustained energy until evening
* Only use caffeine strategically (not dependency)
* No afternoon crashes

**What changed:** I stopped treating symptoms (fatigue) and fixed the root causes (sleep quality, blood sugar, hydration, circadian rhythm).

**Why Most Morning Energy Advice Fails**

The typical advice:

* ""Drink more coffee"" ☕
* ""Take a cold shower"" 🚿
* ""Just wake up earlier"" ⏰
* ""Try an energy drink"" 🥤

**The problem:** All band-aids. None address WHY you have no energy.

**The reality:** Morning energy comes from:

1. Quality sleep the night before
2. Proper circadian rhythm alignment
3. Stable blood sugar
4. Adequate hydration
5. Brain energy metabolism

Fix those five things, and you won't NEED stimulants to function.

**The 5-Step Protocol (What Actually Works)**

**Step 1: Lock In Deep, Restorative Sleep (The Night Before)**

**The foundation:** Your morning starts the night before.

**What I was doing wrong:**

* Inconsistent bedtime (10pm one night, 1am the next)
* Screens until I fell asleep
* No wind-down routine
* Room too warm
* Zero attention to circadian rhythm

**My sleep quality (tracked via Oura Ring):**

* Total sleep: 7 hours (seemed okay)
* Deep sleep: 1.2 hours (barely adequate)
* REM sleep: 55 minutes (terrible - need 90+ minutes)
* Sleep efficiency: 78% (lots of waking/restlessness)
* HRV: 48 (low, indicating poor recovery)

**No wonder I woke up exhausted.**

**What I changed:**

**Evening Protocol (8pm-10:30pm):**

* 8pm: Dim all lights in house
* 9pm: No screens (this was brutal at first)
* 9:30pm: Light walk outside (10-15 minutes, see sunset if possible)
* 10pm: Shower, then wind-down reading or journaling
* 10:15pm: Magnesium glycinate (400mg)
* 10:30pm: In bed, room at 66°F, blackout curtains
* White noise machine on

**Morning Protocol (Critical for next night's sleep):**

* 6:30am: Wake up
* 6:45am: Outside for 10-15 minutes (even if cloudy)
* No sunglasses during this time
* Just standing there with coffee (the outdoor light is the point)

**The science:** Morning light exposure sets your circadian rhythm. It triggers cortisol spike at the RIGHT time (morning) and sets a timer for melatonin production 14-16 hours later (evening). This creates proper sleep-wake cycle.

**Results after 2 weeks:**

* REM sleep: 55 → 95 minutes (massive improvement)
* Deep sleep: 1.2 → 1.8 hours
* Sleep efficiency: 78% → 89%
* HRV: 48 → 64
* **Waking up actually feeling refreshed for first time in years**

**The lesson:** You can't hack morning energy without fixing sleep quality. Period.

**Step 2: Use Creatine Instead of Stimulants**

**The typical morning:**

* Wake up → immediately need caffeine
* Caffeine masks fatigue but doesn't create real energy
* Tolerance builds, need more over time
* Dependency cycle continues

**The alternative:** Creatine for brain energy metabolism

**What is creatine doing?**

* Provides energy substrate (phosphocreatine) for ATP production
* ATP = the actual energy currency your brain uses
* Unlike caffeine (stimulant that borrows energy), creatine provides actual energy substrate
* Benefits cognition, focus, and mental energy even when sleep-deprived

**My protocol:**

* 5g creatine monohydrate daily (timing doesn't matter)
* I take it with breakfast for consistency
* Takes 2-3 weeks to fully saturate muscles/brain

**The difference:**

* Week 1-2: Subtle, maybe placebo
* Week 3+: Noticeable mental clarity and sustained energy
* No jitters, no crash, no dependency
* Works synergistically with good sleep (Step 1)

**Creatine vs Caffeine:**

|**Creatine**|**Caffeine**|
|:-|:-|
|Provides energy substrate|Blocks fatigue signals|
|No tolerance buildup|Tolerance builds quickly|
|No withdrawal|Withdrawal causes headaches|
|Improves baseline energy|Borrows from future energy|
|Works better with consistency|Loses effectiveness daily|

**My current caffeine use:**

* Only 1-2 days per week (strategically)
* Only when I need peak performance (big presentation, tough workout)
* Never as a crutch to function normally

**The result:** I'm not dependent on caffeine to be a functional human anymore.

**Step 3: Control Blood Sugar After Fasting**

**What I used to do (and why it destroyed my mornings):**

**Old breakfast (7am):**

* Bowl of oatmeal with banana and honey
* Orange juice
* Total carbs: \~100g, mostly fast-digesting

**What happened:**

* 7:30am: Feel energized (blood sugar spike)
* 9:30am: Energy crash (insulin overcorrection)
* 10am: Foggy, tired, need more caffeine
* 11am: Hungry again despite eating 4 hours ago

**The blood sugar rollercoaster killed my morning energy every single day.**

**What I changed:**

**New breakfast (7am):**

* 4 whole eggs (cooked in butter)
* 1/2 avocado
* Handful of spinach
* Small serving of berries (only carbs, \~15g)
* Total: High protein, high fat, LOW carb

**What happens now:**

* 7:30am: Satisfied, steady energy
* 9:30am: Still energized, no crash
* 10am: Mentally sharp, productive
* 12pm: Starting to get hungry (normal timing)

**The principle:** Breaking your fast with high-carb foods spikes blood sugar → insulin spike → crash 2 hours later. Breaking fast with protein + fat = stable blood sugar = stable energy.

**The tracked difference:**

* Used CGM (continuous glucose monitor) for 2 weeks
* Old breakfast: Glucose spike to 145 mg/dL, crash to 72 mg/dL
* New breakfast: Gentle rise to 105 mg/dL, stable throughout morning

**Stable blood sugar = stable energy. It's that simple.**

**Step 4: Move Your Body (Even Just 5 Minutes)**

**What most people think:** ""I need a full workout in the morning""

**What actually works:** Short burst of movement to activate your system

**My 5-minute morning movement routine (right after sunlight exposure):**

* 20 jumping jacks (get blood flowing)
* 10 deep bodyweight squats (activate lower body)
* 10 push-ups (activate upper body)
* 30 seconds of arm circles (mobility)
* 2 minutes of box breathing (4-4-4-4 pattern)

**Total time:** 5 minutes

**What this does:**

* Increases blood flow to brain
* Elevates oxygen delivery
* Activates sympathetic nervous system (wake-up response)
* Supports creatine's effect on brain energy
* Signals to body ""we're awake and active now""

**I don't do an intense workout.** Just enough to shift from ""sleep mode"" to ""awake mode.""

**On workout days:** This becomes my warm-up before actual training

**On rest days:** This is all I do, and it's enough

**The result:** Mental clarity hits within 20 minutes of waking instead of 2+ hours

**Step 5: Hydrate Immediately (The Overlooked Game-Changer)**

**The problem:** You wake up dehydrated. Every single morning.

**Why:**

* 7-8 hours without water
* Body loses 1-2 liters through breathing and sweating overnight
* Brain is 75% water
* Even 1-2% dehydration = cognitive impairment

**What I used to do:**

* Wake up → immediately make coffee
* First water intake around 9-10am
* Chronically dehydrated all morning
* Brain function suppressed

**What I do now:**

**Immediately upon waking:**

* 16-20oz of water (room temperature, easier to drink quickly)
* Add pinch of sea salt (electrolytes, helps with hydration)
* Drink before doing anything else

**After morning sunlight + movement:**

* Another 8-12oz water
* Now I can have coffee if I want it (but don't need it)

**Throughout morning:**

* Target 32-40oz total by 10am

**The difference:**

* Mental fog lifts within 10-15 minutes
* Headaches (which I thought were ""normal"") disappeared
* Energy more consistent
* Digestion improved

**The science:** Your brain literally needs water to produce neurotransmitters and conduct electrical signals. Dehydration = slower processing speed, worse focus, lower energy.

**Tracking:** I started tracking hydration and found I was drinking maybe 40oz TOTAL per day. Now I hit 100-120oz daily, with 30-40oz in the first few hours.

**The Complete Morning Protocol (My Actual Routine)**

**6:30am - Wake up**

* Usually 5-10 minutes before alarm now
* Actually feel rested

**6:35am - Hydrate immediately**

* 20oz water with pinch of sea salt
* Chug it, don't sip

**6:45am - Morning sunlight**

* Outside for 10-15 minutes
* No sunglasses
* Just stand there, breathe, wake up naturally

**6:50am - 5-minute movement routine**

* Jumping jacks, squats, push-ups, breathing
* Gets blood flowing, brain activated

**7:00am - Breakfast**

* 4 eggs, avocado, spinach, berries
* 5g creatine mixed in water
* Another 12oz water

**7:30am - Actually ready to start work**

* Mental clarity achieved
* Sustained energy established
* No caffeine needed (but can use if I want peak performance)

**Total time investment:** 30 minutes from waking to fully energized

**The Results (Tracked Over 3 Months)**

**Subjective improvements:**

* Wake up feeling refreshed (not groggy)
* Mental clarity by 7:30am (not 10am)
* Sustained energy until evening (no crashes)
* Better mood throughout day
* More productive morning hours
* Don't ""need"" coffee to function

**Objective improvements (tracked):**

* REM sleep: 55 → 100 minutes average
* HRV: 48 → 67 average
* Fasting glucose: More stable (85-90 mg/dL instead of 95-102)
* Caffeine consumption: 400mg/day → 100mg/day (2-3x/week)
* Productive hours before noon: 1-2 hours → 3-4 hours

**The compound effect:** Better mornings → better sleep → even better mornings → positive cycle

**What Doesn't Work (What I Tried First)**

**Failed approach 1: ""Just drink more coffee""**

* Tolerance built quickly
* Needed more and more
* Afternoon crashes got worse
* Sleep quality declined (caffeine half-life is 5-6 hours)

**Failed approach 2: ""Wake up earlier""**

* Just made me more sleep-deprived
* Didn't fix root cause (poor sleep quality)
* Unsustainable

**Failed approach 3: ""Cold showers""**

* Gave temporary jolt
* Didn't address underlying energy issues
* Stopped doing it after 2 weeks (miserable)

**Failed approach 4: ""Pre-workout supplements""**

* Just more stimulants (same problem as caffeine)
* Dependency created
* Expensive
* Still crashed later

**The lesson:** You can't stimulant your way out of poor sleep, bad blood sugar control, and dehydration.

**Common Questions**

**""Do I have to do ALL five steps?""**

The steps work synergistically:

* Step 1 (sleep) is foundation - without this, nothing else works well
* Steps 2-5 amplify the benefits

You could probably get 60% of results with just Step 1 + 5 (sleep + hydration). But all five together create the full effect.

**""What if I can't get morning sunlight?""**

Get a 10,000 lux light therapy box:

* Use for 20-30 minutes upon waking
* Place at eye level, 16-24 inches away
* Not as good as real sun, but WAY better than nothing
* Cost: $30-100 on Amazon

**""I have to be at work at 6am, how do I do this?""**

Adjust the timing:

* If you wake at 4:30am, do the protocol then
* The principles stay the same (sleep quality, morning light, movement, hydration, blood sugar)
* Consider getting sunlight on lunch break as alternative

**""Can I still drink coffee?""**

Yes! But strategically:

* Not as a dependency to function
* Not immediately upon waking (cortisol already high)
* Wait 90-120 minutes after waking if you use it
* Use it for performance enhancement, not as a crutch

I still have coffee 2-3x/week when I want peak focus. But I don't NEED it anymore.

**""What about energy drinks/pre-workout?""**

Same issue as excessive caffeine:

* Creates dependency
* Doesn't fix root causes
* Tolerance builds
* Crashes follow

If you're using these to function normally, you're masking a problem.

**The Bigger Picture: Energy Is Just The Beginning**

**What I discovered:** Morning energy was just a symptom of larger optimization issues.

When I fixed:

* Sleep quality
* Circadian rhythm
* Blood sugar control
* Hydration
* Basic movement

**Other things improved too:**

* Testosterone increased (420 → 680 ng/dL over 6 months)
* Body composition improved (easier to stay lean)
* Training performance better
* Libido returned
* Mood more stable
* Productivity increased 30-40%

**Morning energy wasn't the goal. It was a side effect of total optimization.**

**Bottom Line**

**The truth:** You don't have an energy problem. You have a sleep quality, blood sugar, and circadian rhythm problem.

**The solution isn't:**

* More caffeine
* Energy drinks
* Stimulants
* ""Toughing it out""

**The solution is:**

1. Fix sleep quality (proper circadian rhythm, evening routine)
2. Provide real energy substrate (creatine, not stimulants)
3. Stabilize blood sugar (low-carb morning meal)
4. Move your body (5 minutes minimum)
5. Hydrate immediately (20oz upon waking)

**Time investment:** 30 minutes per morning

**Results:** Sustained, natural energy without dependency on stimulants

How would you structure your meals and training for maximum benefit?","Catholic 32M/5’11”/205lbs. Title is it but for context: 

During lent I intend to maintain a Catholic style fast which is one full meal a day plus two small “meals” not equal a full meal. I plan to eat this way every day but Sunday for the entirety of Lent. It will will be my normal plant-based plus fish pescatarian diet. A few days will be complete water fasts with just coffee and electrolytes (i.e. Ash Wednesday, Good Friday).

This is mainly for spiritual and physical/mental discipline but I’ve been bulking since November and am ready for a cut. I’ll also be training for two half marathons (one in April the other May) and will drop down to 2 days of lifting weights (I’ve posted my lifting routine elsewhere). That said, I don’t want to crash diet and want to keep calories to around 1700-1800 per day, tracked with MyFitnessPal. This way, I’ll be nourished for training and will minimize muscle loss, while still being at a calorie deficit. 

Feedback I’ve gotten is to maintain clear feeding/fasting windows (so maybe 18/6 intermittent fasting with the main meal in the middle). This way I’ll get some of the actual benefits of the fast beyond caloric restriction. For my small “meals” I’m planning for one to be a protein shake (Vega Plant Protein plus Marine Collagen Peptides and Creatine) and the other to be yogurt/skyr with nuts and berries.

The connection that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking my kindred spirit, my twinflame my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together not long before we explore the world and build a business and forge a life together. A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

You're my person if you know what you want and you won't settle. You know what you deserve and you won't succumb into the pressure of the society.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with garlic-bread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A cozy movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

Yesterday at 5 am, I woke up and opened up the front door for my dogs to go out. Went to turn on the coffee maker, looked back and both dogs were still inside - but, there was a 3rd dog in the middle of the living room. A tiny little chihuahua and my dogs never said a word. It must have walked in when I opened the door.

Preface - I live in the mountains of Centra America....really no near neighbors.

Anyway, this dog was skin and bones and was walking like a drunken sailor. I fed it and he ate, but must have some teeth issues as he had to eat it by scooping food up from the side of his mouth. Anyway, I wrapped him up and kept him warm, safe and fed.

This morning, I took him to the local vet (and there is a language barrier here, which is why I need your help) and she said he was very old and had inflammation of the brain. Best to put him down.

I asked her to give me a few days as I want to do the best for this pup. She gave him a shot of B12 and sent us on our way.

I know absolutely nothing about Chihuahuas. So tell me, is this really a death match for this little one?

1r3uqio,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Junarya/comments/1r3uqio/embracing_the_selfhate/,Embracing the self-hate,"Today, I am 37lbs down from my starting weight, and yes, I did wait until after two coffee poops to weigh myself, but I'm going to go ahead and take the W and not overthink it. 

The past week or so feels like it has flown by. I think this is the way; I have to stop obsessing on day to day changes. I have to put my head down and focus on my feet and just keep pushing forward, let the days pass without hyperfixating on ""dieting"". This is just the New Norm.

I got my period last weekend, and it was a doozy. On Friday, I was just insatiably hungry all day, couldn't seem to quell my appetite no matter what I did, and my emotions were all over the map. I just assumed it had to be my period, and thank god it was. When it started on Saturday, I decided to listen to my body and give it a little break. I went to the store, I bought myself an air fryer and a bunch of low calorie comfort food, and I came home and went into hibernation mode for 48h. I let myself have the entire pint of Halo Top WITH salted almonds on top. (Oh my god, why did I sleep on Halo Top for so long?!) I was 487cals over my limit on Friday, 1cal over on Saturday (lol), and 486cals over on Sunday. But on Sunday, I finally understood the concept of a weekly deficit. It was like my brain clicked on the same thing I was saying at the beginning of this post.. That it's not a day to day battle, this is a long-term project. I had my three days of ""binge eating"" and I still finished the week 36cals under my weekly total. And I've set my daily limit to be plenty low, probably a little lower than it ought to be for my current weight. But it's been enough. I guess. Except for hormonal days. Lol.

I feel like the more time passes, the more I understand what this lifestyle change entails, and I'm finding ways to make it work for me so I am less likely to fail and go back to my old, shitty ways. And part of that is listening to my body and actually being kind to my body and letting it have what it's crying for sometimes. All of my girl friends have lamented about period woes and for all of these years, twenty-three years of periods, I never understood what they meant. I never got period cravings, I never felt famished during my period.. but it was because I just never exercised even the slightest amount of self control in my normal life. If I was craving a pizza, I would go buy a pizza, no matter what day, what time, when I last had it. My life was a constant cycle of rewarding myself with food. 

But now I understand a little bit better. I have gained a little empathy along the way. It also makes me think that pregnancy cravings must absolutely be a real thing too. I get it now, just a little bit.

The other night, as I tossed and turned and struggled to fall asleep with a million thoughts swirling through my mind (thanks, Vyvanse!), I realized something. I realized that over the course of that day, I had found a way to criticize and hate on basically every part of my body. Hair line? That looks like shit, you're probably about a week away from getting gray hairs. Face? Always horrific. Eye bags? Worse every day, idiot. Look at your nose. Look at that gross clogged pore under your nose. Look at the wrinkles around your mouth. Look at how nasty your neck looks. Look how fat your ear lobes are. Look how disgusting your naked skin is. Why are your veins so prominent? Your boobs look ridiculous, they're so saggy, your skin is so pock-marked. Your upper arms are a nightmare. How can armpits be fat?? Why can't you put your fingers around your wrist and have them touch? Why do you have so many sores in your nasty-ass fat rolls? Look at how horrific your stomach is. Look at the state of your thighs, why would anyone ever want to see you undressed? Look at the asymmetry of your trunklike calves. Ever since you fell a year ago, the swelling hasn't gone away. It will probably never go away. Look how gross your feet are, look how the skin on your heels is dry and peeling. 

All day! I spent all day inspecting and criticizing myself, and I was so mentally exhausted by bedtime! What did all that self hate gain me? It's not my fucking body's fault it's this way! I'm the one who has been disrespecting it for so many years! I'm so sick of constantly thinking this way, feeling so overwhelmingly negative about myself! 

So.. instead, I am making a tiny effort to find things that I don't hate about myself. Maybe I will have to lie and make up stuff at first, but maybe I can trick my mind into stopping this vicious way of thinking. 

And honestly? This morning when I got up and turned on some heavy bass music and tried to get myself ready for another day? I thought my butt looked kind of cute in the mirror.

It doesn't. But maybe someday it could. 💜",2,1771002276.0,u_Junarya,0,1.0,False

1r3uq16,https://i.redd.it/qzlsjpkxmajg1.jpeg,The Lighthouse at the End of My Life,"I don’t remember dying so much as I remember the moment the world decided to stop waiting for me.

The hospital room had shrunk over weeks, perhaps months. I lost count somewhere between the third round of chemotherapy and the fourth. The walls pressed closer with every shallow breath I drew, until only the bed felt real and solid, the single fixed point in a space that had begun to resemble a tightening box. Machines ticked in soft, mechanical heartbeats. Their rhythms slowed and grew more deliberate, as though even the equipment had grown weary of prolonging the inevitable. Sarah never left my side. Her fingers remained laced through mine, even when exhaustion dragged her eyelids closed for a few stolen minutes. Each time she startled awake, she squeezed harder and murmured my name like a prayer she refused to release. Our son paced near the window, hands buried deep in his pockets, glancing at me every few seconds as though I might vanish the instant his eyes left my face. He tried to conceal the tremor in his shoulders and the tight clench of his jaw whenever the monitors dipped into dangerous territory. Our daughter curled in the chair beside me, her head resting on the mattress near my hip, hair spilling across the thin blanket like dark water. In a voice that cracked repeatedly, she whispered apologies for every sharp word she had thrown as a teenager, every missed call when life grew too busy, every small wound she believed she had inflicted over the years. “You were always there, Dad,” she repeated, the words fragile as thin ice bearing too much weight. “You were always there. I’m so sorry I didn’t see how much it mattered until now.”

The last thing I felt was Sarah’s lips brushing my forehead, soft and cool against my fevered skin. “We’re right here,” she murmured, her breath unsteady. “We love you so much. Just rest now. We’ve got you.” Then the beeps stretched into one long, unbroken note, flat and final. Everything dissolved into a quiet so profound it felt like falling forever: weightless, directionless, endless.

When I opened my eyes, I was alone on black sand.

The grains were cool and almost weightless, shifting beneath me like powdered silk stirred by an invisible current. No sun burned overhead. No stars pierced the vault above. Only an endless ceiling of pale gray stretched in every direction, swallowing light before shadows could form and draining the world of all contrast. The ocean rolled in with slow, deliberate breaths. Each wave exhaled foam that crept a little closer than the last before retreating with a soft hiss. The air carried salt and something ancient: the scent of stone polished smooth by centuries of water, or perhaps the faint memory of stone long dissolved. I looked down at myself. Clean jeans, a plain gray shirt, bare feet sinking slightly into the cool surface. My body felt light, unscarred, strong in a way it had not been since before the first scan showed shadows spreading through my lungs like ink bleeding into water. No pain throbbed in my ribs. No tubes tugged at my skin. No rattle haunted each inhale. Just me, whole, breathing freely for the first time in years.

Far down the curving beach stood the lighthouse.

A white tower marked by wide black bands rose against the gray, solitary and certain. The lantern at its crown revolved in a slow, unhurried circle. Its beam sliced through the murk like a deliberate knife through fog. When the light passed over my face, I felt a brief, startling warmth, as though someone had opened their arms and let sunlight pour out just for me, bathing me in something close to forgiveness. Then the beam moved on, sweeping away, and the cold gray returned, heavier than before.

I sat for what felt like forever. Time did not march here. It drifted, lazy and uncommitted, pooling around me without urgency. I never grew hungry, never felt the bite of cold, never grew restless enough to pace. I simply waited, watching the light sweep in its patient arc and listening to the waves sigh in and out like the slow respiration of something vast and indifferent. Eventually curiosity, or perhaps boredom, stirred me. I stood and walked to the water’s edge. My footprints appeared behind me in perfect impressions, then vanished within seconds, as if the beach refused to hold any memory of my passage. I called out once: my name, a hello, anything. My voice sounded small and thin, swallowed instantly by the vastness, leaving no echo.

I returned to my spot and sat again, knees drawn up, arms wrapped around them.

The beam from the lighthouse was deliberate in finding me this time. It swept across the sand until it found me.

When the beam hit me, I was eight again. The kitchen on Maple Street glowed with morning sun streaming through the window above the sink, painting everything in warm gold. My mother stood at the stove in her faded blue robe, humming a half-remembered tune from some old radio show she loved. She turned, saw me perched on the counter stool with my chin in my hands, and her whole face softened with joy so pure it hurt to look at. “There’s my heart,” she said, sliding pancakes onto my plate. Butter pooled in the warm centers and melted slowly. My father came in from the garage, smelling of motor oil and fresh coffee, his work boots leaving faint prints on the linoleum. He pressed a kiss to the top of my head. “Morning, champ. You okay?” They moved around me in easy rhythm, talking about bills that were tight but manageable, the neighbor’s new dog that barked too much, whether the porch needed repainting before winter. Every few minutes one of them touched my shoulder, my arm, my hair: simple touches, certain touches. The kind that quietly declare you belong here, you are wanted here, you are loved here without condition or question.

The light released me. I gasped on the sand, hands pressed hard to my chest as though I could hold the memory inside. Tears arrived without warning, hot, sudden, unstoppable. I had not cried like that since childhood, not with that raw, open abandon.

The beam returned sooner this time, almost eager.

Sixteen now. Stadium lights blazed overhead, turning the field into a bright island in the night. The crowd roared as I crossed the goal line, ball tucked tight against my chest, legs pumping through the final yards. Teammates swarmed, helmets clacking together, voices raw with triumph and adrenaline. Tommy, my brother in every way that mattered, grabbed my shoulders and shouted over the noise, “You did it, man! You fucking did it!” In the locker room the celebration settled into something deeper, quieter. He sat beside me on the bench, shoulder to shoulder, sweat still drying on his skin. “Listen,” he said quietly, voice rough. “I know I don’t say it enough, but you’re the reason I didn’t drop out junior year. You’re the reason I kept showing up to class, to practice, to everything. I love you for that, John. I really do.” The others joined in with quiet thanks that felt heavier than any trophy: rides home at 2 a.m. when someone’s car broke down, covering practices when a guy was sick, being the one who never let anyone feel alone on the team. Later, under the parking-lot lamps, Lisa pressed her forehead to mine and whispered, “You make me believe good things can last. You make me believe in forever.”

Back on the beach I curled forward, forehead to knees, shaking. The ache in my chest was no longer mere pain. It had sharpened into something alive, something that wanted to tear me open from the inside.

The lighthouse appeared closer each time I looked up. Not dramatically, not in a blink, just enough to quicken my pulse and make the distance feel less infinite. Its hum had become audible now, a low thrum that settled deep in my bones like a second heartbeat.

Another pass of the beam.

Wedding day. The church smelled of lilies and polished wood. Sunlight slanted through stained glass in soft colors. Sarah walked toward me down the aisle, eyes shining, her hand trembling slightly in her father’s arm. When she reached me she took both my hands and held them as though they were the only things keeping her steady in the world. “I choose you,” she said before the vows even began, voice barely above a whisper. “Every day. Forever.” The reception glowed loud and golden with laughter, clinking glasses, stories told and retold. My sister’s toast cut through the noise: “To my brother, who has spent his life being everyone’s safe place, the one who shows up, who listens, who stays. We love you more than words can hold.” Friends pulled me into lingering hugs that lasted longer than usual. Sarah’s mother kissed my cheek and said, “You’ve given her the kind of love I always prayed she’d find.” On the dance floor Sarah rested her head on my chest and breathed, “You’re my home, John. You’ve always been my home.”

The light released me. I sobbed now, great, ugly sobs that ripped out of me in waves. The sand absorbed them without a sound, without judgment.

Then the fog arrived. Thin at first, ghostly tendrils curling around my ankles like cold smoke. It thickened steadily, carrying the faint scent of iron and wet earth, something metallic and old. The waves reached farther inland, foam brushing my toes before retreating reluctantly, as though unwilling to leave me untouched. The lighthouse stood close enough now that I could see faint cracks in its white paint and rust beginning to bloom on the iron railing that circled the lantern room.

The beam came faster, almost urgent.

Our daughter’s birth. Sarah’s grip crushed my hand until I felt bones grind. Her face was fierce with effort, sweat beading on her brow. The first cry, sharp and alive, sliced through the room. They laid the tiny body on Sarah’s chest, slick and perfect. She looked up at me through tears and said, “Look at her, John. Look what we made.” Family crowded the room: my parents weeping openly, my sister snapping photos through her own tears, everyone saying the same thing in different words: “You’re going to be such a good father.” Years tumbled past in flashes: first steps on unsteady legs, first words garbled but clear in meaning, nightmares soothed with stories whispered in the dark, scraped knees kissed until the tears stopped, graduations where they hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. “I love you, Dad,” they would say at every milestone, meaning it with their whole hearts, no reservation.

Another pass. College graduation for our son. Tommy buying rounds at the bar afterward, raising his glass high: “To the guy who never let us fall, who carried more than his share so the rest of us could stand taller. We’re here because of you.”

Another. Promotion day at work. Coworkers clapping, my boss shaking my hand too long, holding my gaze: “You’re the heart of this place, John. The reason people stay, the reason we succeed.”

Another. Summer barbecues with smoke curling into blue sky, thank-you notes tucked into pockets from neighbors, colleagues, strangers whose lives I’d touched in small ways: late-night calls when friends needed someone to listen without fixing, Sarah’s surprise weekend away “because you give everything and never ask for anything back.”

Each memory struck harder than the last, deeper, more precise. Each return to the beach left me more broken open, raw, exposed. The fog thickened into a wall now, muffling sound and pressing close, intimate as a shroud. The lighthouse towered above me. Its door was visible at last: wood dark and banded with iron, weathered but solid. The hum roared inside my chest, vibrating through ribs and spine.

I walked toward it on legs that barely held me, each step heavier than the last. I laid my palm against the door. It felt warm. Alive. Pulsing faintly beneath my touch.

The final beam struck.

No warmth this time. Only clarity: cold, merciless, complete.

The cat under my bed, small body jerking as the knife went in, a soft gurgle that ended too soon. The college girl who trusted my smile in the campus parking lot and never came home, her laughter fading into screams in the trunk. Hitchhikers whose last sight was my face in the rearview mirror, eyes wide with sudden understanding. Women whose names I read later in newspapers, their photos grainy and forever young, captions speaking of “tragic disappearance” and “ongoing search.” Men whose cars sat abandoned near trails I knew too well, keys still in the ignition. Basements lit by single bulbs swinging overhead. Plastic sheeting taped carefully to walls and floors. Shovels leaning against concrete. The careful folding of clothes stained dark, placed neatly in bags. The long drive home under ordinary streetlights. The shower running hot until the water turned cold. The gentle kiss on Sarah’s sleeping temple as I slipped into bed beside her. The dreamless sleep that followed, deep and undisturbed.

Every cut. Every plea whispered or screamed. Every shallow grave dug under moonlight, earth patted smooth, leaves scattered to hide the disturbance. Dozens. Faces frozen in the instant they understood mercy would not arrive, eyes locked on mine, searching for the man they thought they knew.

I fell to my knees before the door. It groaned open on rusted hinges.

Heat poured out: sulfur, ash, the sharp stench of burning hair and something sweeter, more terrible. Screams erupted from below, layered and raw, voices I recognized in the marrow of my bones. They called my name now, not in rage, but in terrible recognition, a chorus of accusation and sorrow.

“John…”

“John…”

I tried to crawl backward. The sand seized my wrists and ankles, cold and unyielding as iron cuffs. Heat climbed my legs in slow waves. Red light pulsed from the stairwell within, flickering like a dying heart. Blackened hands reached up, grasping at air, at me.

Everything the lighthouse had shown me was true. The love had been real: every hug that lingered, every “we’re proud,” every “I love you” spoken in quiet rooms or crowded celebrations. But it had revealed only the surface. The mask. The careful performance that allowed the love to exist, untouched by the truth beneath.

The door stood wide. Flames licked up the steps, hungry. The screams sharpened into something almost tender, almost welcoming, as though they had waited lifetimes for this reunion.

I felt the pull, not from the sand but from somewhere deeper: behind my ribs, hooked into the soft places where guilt should have lived but never did until now. It drew me forward, inch by inch. I clawed at the beach. Grains poured uselessly through my fingers, refusing to hold.

The lighthouse light went dark. Only hellfire remained, painting the fog in crimson.

They never knew.

That was the final cruelty.

Sarah’s hand in mine at the end. Our daughter’s whispered apologies. Our son’s vigilant pacing. The pancakes melting with butter. The goal line crossed under bright lights. The vows exchanged in golden light. All of it genuine. All of it earned in their eyes. None of it aware of the shadow that moved behind the man they loved.

The heat closed over me. My own scream joined the chorus, high, endless, mine, blending with the others until I could no longer tell where my voice ended and theirs began.

And somewhere far above, on a beach no one would ever find, the waves kept rolling in, patient and indifferent, erasing the last trace that I had ever been loved at all.",3,1771002245.0,anxietypilled,0,1.0,False
1r3unou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3unou,"Late mother's grimore, experience interpretation","Sorry this is long, the flow kicked in. Ha. This is my mom's grimoire from 1974. I used to flip through this book as a kid while I waited for my turn on the computer. For some reason I felt the need to pick it up today. While flipping through again, I found her handwriting on a ritual page for midsommar, and a coffee stain on a solo ritual for a full moon. 

It sounds silly but when someone's gone, a coffee stain shows signs of energy, life, memories you're left to ponder on since there's no one left to ask. 

I'm a third generation woman of wicca on my mother's side of the family. My Great Aunt died when I was young, from diabetes-- she was blind and a double amputee, my god was she brilliant and wickedly funny. Her senses were otherworldly. I found a letter in my mom's things where she wrote to her after my mom relocated from Portland ME to San Francisco CA in the 80's. My Aunt disclosed that she's wiccan and that her hopes are to return to earth as a blade of grass. I believe that this grimoire may have originally been hers and it served as a parting gift. 

I also found her Aquarian tarot deck by David Palladini-- she had the High Priestess card framed in an emerald and gold frame. I'm sitting in the room she died in currently and felt called to pull a 3 card spread and was very pleased with the results... but I feel like I'm missing something. It's probably just the hole that grief left. 

  

My mom died 2 years ago from early-onset dementia. We didn't have a good relationship at all, she was traumatized, in pain, and her pain grew legs and turned her into an insecure, bitter narcissist. We have a much, much better relationship now that she's no longer burdened by her body and brain. When she died, I felt a transfer of dense, fluid, pink energy through the wall (she died at home) at promptly 5:55. I couldn't get up off my couch though, no clue why. My partner said he couldn't either, he's pretty spiritually in tune with the paranormal but otherwise not so much, so that was surprising. My Dad walked in 20-25 minutes later to tell me she passed. 

Ever since she died, I've very much felt like she wrapped up her knowledge in a parcel and gifted it to me, as if I downloaded her brain lol I know that doesn't make any sense but I vividly remember going down a rabbit hole about French and thought to myself, ""I don't know French, why is it making sense to me now? Why am I suddenly connecting etymological roots?"" It was a really weird night. I don't really share things like this with people anymore, I've understandably come across as flat out wacky or delusional to the common eye. But I felt compelled to share here. Perhaps someone can help me make sense of it? Or anyone who can share a similar experience? 

The feels are real. Gonna try to have a good day today despite the icky winter weather and asphalt covered snow.

In January we started a good vibes coworking group where we check out different places around the city and cowork. It's been fun making new friends while getting cool stuff done. Getting out of isolation is so helpful.

This is our 6th week of making genuine connections while we also do our work, and it would be fun to have you with us. Going solo to a cafe can be positive yet can also be isolating. Connecting with others and creating a bond helps boost our overall wellbeing and happiness.

Want to join us for our next session?

Send me a dm with your first name and time you plan to arrive so we can save a chair for you.

Monday

February 16th

930 am to 1230 pm, join for all or some of the time 

& optional lunch in the area following our session 

Neighborhood: River North

River Roux

110 N Wacker Drive, Lower Level

Have a favorite place for us to check out? We welcome suggestions. Post in the comments on your favorite place. Usually we need about 5 to 8 seats, outlets, WiFi, music low, food/coffee/tea/ etc to buy, and it's ok if we talk with each other so libraries (although wonderful) won't be ideal. It's a good mix of conversation with time to get work done too.

Questions, suggestions, etc? 

Post them in the comments or send a dm.

Have a beautiful day.

1r3um3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Signal_Dinner_9392/comments/1r3um3g/a_stoic_perspective_on_ramadan_why_we_fast/,A Stoic Perspective on Ramadan: why we fast,"One might think that Ramadan is purely for abstaining from food, fasting for prolonged hours to get hungry, then breaking your fast and going about your day. I heard many people say the reason for this practice is to feel for the poor and the needy; while this could be true in some sense, it’s much more than that. To the observer, it is a ritual of deprivation. To the practitioner, it is an exercise in the highest form of human faculty: the Will.

Ramadan basically comes down to controlling your **impulses and desires**, even though they are completely natural, so you can become more focused when you work, more eloquent when you talk, and happier in life. That’s because living a hedonistic lifestyle will inevitably lead to depression because your life is dictated by desires instead of goals and achievements. In the language of the Stoics, the person who cannot control their appetite is not a free man, but a slave to his own biology.

The Rational Constraint:

Life should be purely based on rational thoughts instead of acting upon your needs, as that is what differentiates humans from animals. An animal eats when it finds food; it sleeps when it is tired; it reacts when it is provoked. Humans, however, possess the ""***Prohairesis***""-- the power of choice and the ability to stand apart from our impressions.

In my studies of applied mathematics, I have often seen how a system without constraints is simply chaotic.

To solve a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), one must define the boundary conditions. Without these limits, the math is infinite and meaningless. Ramadan serves as the ultimate boundary condition for the human soul. It provides the ""constraints"" within which we find the ""solution"" to our character.

Ramadan is about recognizing your starvation, your tiredness, and your demotivation and instead of complaining, you work despite all these setbacks. Stoicism teaches us that we do not control the hunger pangs (the external impression), but we do control our assent to them. We acknowledge the sensation: ""**I feel hungry**."" But we do not add the value judgment: ""*And this is terrible."" By removing the judgment, we maintain our internal fortress. We realize that the body is merely a vessel that can be commanded by the mind.*

From Hedonism to discipline:

I used to live a tremendously hedonistic life, succumbing to my every need, giving in to every desire, and giving up easily. In that state, I was like a leaf in the wind, moved by every passing whim. But now, I have gone back to God, worshipping Him in every moment, working hard so He can forgive me and redeem my actions. I needed to repent, to go back to the path of enlightenment. I discovered that my life was not worth living if I acted without self-restraint. Furthermore, I realized that to get anywhere in life (whether in the deep complexities of linear algebra or the simple act of being a good neighbor) my life had to be controlled by discipline.

Marcus Aurelius once wrote, ""The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."" During Ramadan, the hunger is the impediment. But instead of being a wall, it becomes the tool. The very weakness of the body becomes the strength of the spirit. When you are fasting, you are forced to be efficient. You cannot afford to waste energy on frivolous anger or useless chatter.

You become like a well-optimized algorithm, stripping away the noise to focus on the signal.

Emotional handling:

Another important aspect of Ramadan is the control of emotions. Fasting is not just about avoiding food but also about improving one’s character. Muslims are encouraged to avoid anger, negative speech, and harmful actions. This helps develop emotional stability and mindfulness. When a person learns to manage their emotions during Ramadan, they become better at handling stress and conflicts in daily life. This leads to stronger relationships and a more peaceful mind.

In Stoic philosophy, this is known as *Apatheia*—not a state of being ""apathetic"" in the modern sense, but a freedom from the disturbing passions. When you are hungry and someone cuts you off in traffic or speaks harshly to you, the ""animal"" within wants to growl. Ramadan creates a space between the stimulus and the response. In that space, we find our humanity. We choose patience over reaction. This emotional regulation is a form of spiritual ""numerical method""—we are iteratively refining our behavior, reducing the error in our character until we reach a state of convergence with our higher selves.

Connection and Divine Order:

Ramadan is also a way for us to connect with our relatives and loved ones, although they may be far away. In the shared experience of the fast, there is a communal Stoicism. We are all participating in a collective rejection of the material in favor of the spiritual. This connects us to the \_Logos\_, the divine reason that governs the universe. By thinking about God and meditating on our place in His creation, we align our individual wills with the Universal Will.

We often think that happiness comes from the addition of pleasures. Stoicism and Ramadan teach us that happiness comes from the subtraction of dependencies. If I need a coffee, a snack, and a comfortable chair to be happy, my happiness is fragile. If I can be content while hungry, tired, and working through complex problems, then my happiness is invincible. This is the ""path of enlightenment"": the realization that our worth is not calculated by what we consume, but by what we can endure and how we can serve.

Conclusion: The Holiest Month:

Ramadan is the holiest month in Islam for a reason. Not only is it a chance for a more religious life, but also a deeper, more philosophical one characterized by self-control and ambition. It is a period of personal growth where we trade the temporary satisfaction of the senses for the permanent fortification of the soul.

The lessons learned during Ramadan help individuals become more patient, mindful, and compassionate. We learn gratitude because we realize that the water we take for granted at sunset is a miracle. We learn humility because we realize how dependent our physical bodies are, yet how independent our spirits can be. By the time the month ends, we should not simply return to our old ways. We should emerge as more rational, disciplined, and God-conscious individuals. Ramadan is the training ground; the rest of the year is the battlefield where we apply these Stoic virtues to live a life of purpose, achievement, and peace.

But by the summer of 2022, my toddler son and I were often the only Black folks on the playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a fact that felt both alienating and surreal,” the novelist Naomi Jackson writes. 

Jackson was born in Crown Heights to parents from the Caribbean — part of a tidal wave of late-20th-century West Indian and African emigration that changed the face of Black New York. “My formative years were in Flatbush, which is called ‘Little Caribbean’ even though it becomes less and less Caribbean,” she writes.

Over two decades, from 2000 to 2020, New York City lost nearly 200,000 Black folks, or about 9 percent of its Black residents. These losses have been particularly notable in historically Black strongholds like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem. Data shows that in 2000, Black residents made up approximately 75 percent of Bed-Stuy’s population, and that number dropped to about 40 percent between 2019 and 2023, with the white population increasing more than tenfold.

In 2006, Jackson convinced her dad that buying property in Prospect–Lefferts Gardens was a smart idea. “At the time, I was 25 years old and scraping together a down payment on a modest studio apartment through a combination of savings and first-time-homebuyer grants. The neighborhood was already transforming; there was a new coffee shop and more white residents. Back then, the abbreviation PLG felt like a harbinger of gentrification that would protect my property value. Now, it feels more like a death knell for the childhood I remember.”

I was with my coworker after work in a known coffee shop in Heliopolis where we sat on the outdoor terrace area. We saw the coffee shop manager pull a child (around 11) forcibly as he cries across the street right in front of the shop. Then my coworker went to confront him and the ""manager"" said that he's a beggar and it isn't the first time warning him. We obviously yelled at him telling him how it does not grant him the right to assault the kid. Then the kid told us he took him to the garage before with someone else and they ""beat him up"" and filmed him to threaten him every time he comes close. Everyone sitting heard everything and no one did anything. Except one girl got up and left. And the manager just smirked and seemed not to care, like he's enjoying this.

Then I took the kid aside to calm him down and told him to not come here again. Unfortunately the police wouldn't help either because there are no hard evidence but god I hope he's safe.

Then when we were leaving a guy came and started saying that if I have a coffee shop I wouldn't want beggars to come anywhere near the customers then started rambling about how a kid his age could get a job and not beg.. 

I'm sorry but what the fuck is wrong with everyone? How have people reached such a low..? And there's nothing we could've done, realistically speaking. God knows how many more kids gets abused because this god forsaken country put them in such circumstances.

People have lost all kinds of mercy and humanity.. It breaks my heart seeing how the souls of these people are ridden of any sort of compassion or sympathy, but so full of sick desires for abuse, cruelty and using any kind of power to make others' lives more miserable.

Also I only test my morning fasting sugars which should be below 5.3 and then my one hour post meal sugars which should be below 7.9, so how will I know if I can tolerate the coffee with a bit of sugar anyway? Just test them an hour after the coffee? And if so what should it be below?

I currently have a De'longhi Stilosa and a DF54 grinder, had the Stilosa for almost 4 years and it's time to move on (and about 1 year of the DF54).

I mostly drink espressos, while my wife usually just adds a tiny bit of warm milk to the her espresso, so a frother is not that important.  
Things that are important: solenoid valve for cleaner pucks, quick heat-up time, pre-infusion, and preferably 58mm to be able to easily upgrade to a bigger machine down the line, with the same gear. I live in the US, would like to stay under the 500$ range.

I know that the Gaggia Classic Pro would be a natural next step but the long heat-up time is a big turnoff for me. I am mostly torn between the following 3 machines, though would take other suggestions:

1. Breville Bambino plus (\~400$) - I feel that this is the default choice. My wife is not a fan of the looks, and I am not a fan of the 54mm. I also understand that it gets some issues with some light-medium roasts which is what I prefer to drink.
2. Turin Legato V2 (\~450$) - Check most of the boxes. Main issue is the slower heat up time. I know this can be solved with workarounds but I'd rather avoid jumping through hoops if possible. I usually make coffee first thing in the morning and don't want have to delay my whole routine to allow the machine to heat up.
3. Gemilai Owl G3006 (\~350$) - Best value for money. Checks all the boxes. I understand the heat-up time is pretty quick, though its using a thermoblock and not a boiler. I know its missing OPV compared to the other machines, but I don't know if thats a big enough factor for me if I can adjust the grind size to still hit the spot. Also looks really great which is a bonus. Main concern is support in case there are issues with the machine down the line.

Happy to get some feedback from people who have experience with those machines or suggestions in general. Thanks!",1,1771001504.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1r3udti,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSpreadContent/comments/1r3udti/why_affordable_luxury_boosts_confidence/,Why Affordable Luxury Boosts Confidence,"There is this weird unspoken rule we’ve all internalized somewhere along the way. It says that looking good has to cost a lot. That feeling put together, polished, like you’ve got your life together is a privilege reserved for people with bigger budgets and clearer priorities. And for the longest time, the jewelry industry really leaned into that narrative. You want real gold? Pay up. You want stones that actually sparkle? Hope you’ve been saving. It created this barrier where adornment felt less like self-expression and more like a status test.

But here’s the thing. Confidence doesn’t actually live in a price tag. It lives in how a piece makes you feel the second you put it on. And that feeling? It doesn’t care about your bank account. It cares about whether the earrings catch the light just right when you turn your head. It cares about the weight of the metal, the way the clasp feels easy to fasten, the little gasp you make when you catch your reflection unexpectedly. That’s what affordable luxury actually does. It removes the financial anxiety so you can just enjoy the thing. And brands like [Cate & Chloe jewelry](https://cateandchloe.com/) have figured out that the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive. You don’t need to drain your savings account to own pieces that make you feel like the main character.

Think about how you act when you’re wearing something you truly love. Not something you settled for because it was on clearance. Not something you’re secretly worried will turn your skin green by lunchtime. Something you picked intentionally because it made your heart do a little flip. You stand differently. You gesture more. You make eye contact. It’s not vanity. It’s alignment. The outside finally matches the inside. And that’s the thing about jewelry specifically. It’s intimate. It sits against your skin all day. It goes with you to meetings, dates, coffee runs, late nights. It becomes part of your personal uniform. So when you can access pieces that are well made, that hold up, that don’t force you to choose between quality and rent, something shifts. You stop saving your best self for some imaginary future version of your life. You just live in it now.

There’s also a certain freedom that comes with not being afraid to wear your nice things. You know the feeling. You buy something beautiful but it sits in the box because you’re waiting for the right occasion. A wedding. An anniversary. A fancy dinner. Meanwhile, Tuesday is happening. Wednesday is happening. Life is happening. Affordable luxury lets you stop treating your jewelry like it’s too good for your regular life. You wear the hoops to the grocery store. You wear the pendant to pick up takeout. And somehow, that makes everything feel a little more special. It’s also about signaling to yourself. Not to anyone else, although compliments are always nice. But to you. When you put on a piece that feels elevated, you are quietly telling your own brain that you are worth the effort. That you deserve nice things even if nobody is throwing you a party or taking your picture. That is where the confidence actually comes from. Not the brand name. Not the carat weight. The quiet internal agreement that you don’t need permission to feel good.

People talk a lot about dressing for the job you want. But honestly, it’s bigger than that. You dress for the version of yourself you’re becoming. And every time you choose a piece that makes you feel capable and beautiful, you inch a little closer to her. The jewelry isn’t the destination. It’s just the reminder along the way. There is something really powerful about a price point that doesn’t induce panic. It takes the pressure off. You can experiment. You can try a style you wouldn’t normally go for because the risk is lower. Maybe you’ve always been a silver girl but you’re curious about gold. Maybe you’ve never worn drop earrings because they felt too dressy. Affordable luxury gives you room to play. And that playfulness, that willingness to evolve your look, is confidence in motion.

At the end of the day, nobody knows what you paid for your earrings. They just know you look like you’re glowing. And honestly, that’s the only metric that actually matters.",1,1771001502.0,TheSpreadContent,0,1.0,False
1r3udah,https://v.redd.it/h8fm5w5lkajg1,"Shared apartment for rent, for March, at Dundas and Gladstone $1200, short term with possibility of long term","Hi all, I'm looking for a single person to share a four room unfurnished apartment for March. 

my current roommate is leaving and I am unsure if I will be staying here past March. I had a hearing at the tribunal for rent owing. I am waiting on their decision.

I had been unemployed but I am working again and able to pay the arrears.

If the decision goes in my favour, I will be staying in the unit and will be looking for a long term roommate.

the location is great, with everything in walking distance. I've lived in the neighbourhood for 20 years and love it.

The apartment is two floors, 2nd and third, above a coffee shop. It's clean and bright, windows in every room, and quiet. You would have two rooms on the second floor which also contains the shared bathroom and kitchen. the front most room is fairly large about 15'x14' and has a balcony that looks on to Dundas Street, with sliding glass doors. the other room is smaller and would be more suitable for a bedroom.

There's wood laminate flooring throughout the unit, with tiled entryway and bathroom and herringbone floor in the kitchen.

No AC but you could put one in. No laundry but several laundry mats close by.

1r3u8r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyholistic/comments/1r3u8r3/golden_milk_vs_turmeric_supplements_curious_which/,Golden milk vs turmeric supplements - curious which everyone prefers?,"Hi everyone! I’ve always been curious about health and wellness, and things kind of took off when I started having GI issues (IBS and GERD). Lately, I’ve been looking into turmeric more seriously. I kept seeing it come up for inflammation and digestive support, as well as just overall wellness, so I decided to experiment with both golden milk and turmeric capsules. 

Now, I want to emphasize that I am not a health expert. But today I want to share some thoughts about golden milk and turmeric capsules. I’ve been experimenting with both and wanted to explore how they fit into a routine. Additionally, I'd also like to hear what works for you all! 

So, here is my experience from using both options

**Golden milk: the ritual**

I’ve found that making golden milk has become a bit of a comforting daily ritual for me. Since I try to limit my coffee intake, this has been a lovely warm alternative. I always start my evening sleep routine with a cup of golden milk and a book. I’ve been sleeping pretty well lately, though who knows if it’s related. 

But what about the pros and cons? 

Pros: I find golden milk very comforting. From what I’ve read, combining the turmeric with fats (I make it with coconut milk) and black pepper can really help with absorption. Plus, it forces me to slow down and sip something warm. It has also helped me a lot with mindfulness - something I’ve also been trying to work on. 

Cons: It takes time! You have to heat the milk, mix the spices, and sometimes it can stain your favorite mug (or hands if you are using natural turmeric) if you are not careful. Now, there are some pre-made mixes available, but I haven’t loved all of them. Two options I’ve enjoyed are Golden Hour by Live it Up and Gaia’s Golden Milk. Full disclosure (because I always want to be honest about what I’m trying!) I was given the Golden Hour as part of a promotion, but I did really enjoy it!

**Turmeric supplements: the convenient option**

On days when I know I’m busy or when my stomach feels off, I often rely on turmeric capsules to not skip it entirely. 

Pros: Zero prep time. You know exactly how much you are getting and without measuring spoons (and there’s no need to clean up afterwards). 

Cons: You miss out on that immediate, soothing feeling that a warm drink provides. Also, I always double-check that the supplement includes black pepper (“piperine”) to boost absorption. Another thing to consider is where the supplement comes from; check the sources to ensure you are getting a clean supplement. When it comes to golden milk, all the ingredients come from the supermarket and are organic. So, all said and done, it’s easier to control. 

For me, it all comes down to timing. Most of the days, I have time to enjoy my golden milk to help me wind down. But on the rare occasions I come home late, I choose turmeric capsules. I’ve tried a few from Nature Made and Gaia Herbs and haven’t really noticed a difference between brands, tbh. 

Anyone else taking turmeric? I’m curious, how do you all incorporate this? Do you find that the ritual of making the drink helps you stay consistent, or do you prefer the “done in a couple of seconds” approach of a supplement? Are there other factors I should consider when deciding when to use one or if one is better than the other? 

I’d love to hear everyone’s experiences!

I'm following the Trials dosage, so I'm at week 6 and into my 2nd round of 4mg. I'm on TRT as well, every other week pin, and I've been supplementing with liposomal NAD+ and only recently added 5 Amino 1MQ taking one 200MG pill a day.

To start, my focus and energy levels are off the chart. I'm super energetic in the AM without coffee, with great focus. I also generally find that the feeling of food noise suppression goes away 3 or 4 days after my injection day. Haven't been the most active during the day (tied to my desk) because I've had contractors in my house and my 5 dogs need to stay with me cooped up all day until they leave. I did manage to get a couple of night workouts in but would prefer to be more active during the day.

Started my journey at 298lbs and today I registered 285lbs. I'll take  it. My body feels like its going through a recomp which I've done a bunch of times in the past. I'm 51, former college athlete, playing weight was around 230lbs at 6'1. I've lifted consistently through the years up until my mid 40's. 5 years ago installed a gym in my basement to help with getting it done.

Not too many side effects, the most noticeable one is usually a feeling of a tinge of what ""could"" be the start of being nauseous, but I'm not nauseated. It's just a signal that something is going on in my stomach. If I eat a little bit, it goes away and all good.

The other is acid reflux. I usually get it late at night if I eat after 7pm. Tums takes care of that. I try to make my last meal ,or a protein snack around 6 to 6:30pm. Pays to listen to your body

I'm not one of those hyper responders, and it's ok. I don't think I have a ton of water weight to lose. I do think I have a lot of insulin resistance as evidenced by a lot of visceral fat around my mid section.

(a) Get up earlier: sounds insane but by getting up an hour before i need to start getting ready for work, i can make a fancy coffee and enjoy it, read a magazine, listen to a record, prep breakfast and lunch.

(b) Reframing my commute as “me-time” - been mainlining an audiobook I’ve really enjoyed and working my way through comedy podcasts.

(d) Romanticize the evening! This is what it’s all about, right? Either I’m catching up on my show or doing a workout I enjoy or cooking a new recipe or catching up with friends.

1r3u4lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1r3u4lj/vyvanse_only_works_with_caffeine/,Vyvanse only works with Caffeine,"So I started Generic Vyvanse back around the first of the year. Started on a 30mg dose with no initial therapeutic benefit till I drank coffee at random one day at which point It was like a switch flipped. I had a quiet brain, focus, motivation, etc. I assumed that meant I needed a higher dose. My first month ends and we titrate to 40mg. I decide to give it a good couple weeks without caffeine figuring it would be perfect and I’d be golden.

No dice.

Same exact issue, no real therapeutic benefit(honestly had some vasoconstriction side effects even IYKYK) and today I add a redbull to the mix, boom we’re in business.

Through the last month and a half I’ve played with different breakfasts and protein amounts, timing, good sleep vs bad. The only thing that makes a difference to me is the presence of caffeine. Pretty much it works with it and with the exception of day 1 or 2 of going to 40mg it does not work without it. For reference I used to drink a redbull every morning during the work week just to kind of get some energy but going without caffeine hasn’t been an issue to me unless I was very sleep deprived.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

I am planning on a (first time, solo) mid-June trip to Greece, and my first impulse was ""one week in Kefalonia, one week in Crete"" - I have pretty much disposable time, however I am re-thinking that now due to the number of flights involved back and forth; it's not a deal breaker if it's worth it, but I do hate flying.

  
Things I'm looking forward to doing - 

  
\- A few dives; I'm a scuba diver and love being in the water. It doesn't have to be amazing diving, I am pretty easy to please.

\- Hanging out at the beach and relaxing mostly every day for at least a little while; a hotel situated close to one would be great.

\- Walking around towns/villages; poking in and out of shops, snacking and eating, a coffee or beer here and there just wasting time enjoying the view.

\- Day trips / excursions to wherever doing whatever; I am fine with touristy stuff, I like the idea of showing up somewhere, handing a local some money and having someone haul me around and tell me all the interesting things out there. Bonus for boat trips.

Other -

\- I don't care much for hiking. Definitely not a requirement. 

\- I have driven on some pretty sketchy roads in Grenada and a few other countries, so renting a car and driving in a foreign country with narrow scary roads doesn't bother me too much, but I don't want to fry my nerves on a daily basis avoiding falling off a cliffside or inconveniencing locals.

What say you? Split it up for a week or so at two places or stick to one island (maybe multiple locations per island)?  


Would also appreciate any recommendations for stays, excursions, restaurants per location.

1r3u3pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1r3u3pw/i_can_poop_again/,I can poop again!!!,"Hello everyone, 

Like many of you, I’ve been struggling with constipation since about three months in. I’m currently 10 months in (32M and down 60lbs from 255 to 195) and the constipation was getting to the point that I was considering stopping. 

I’ve always made sure to get 30ish grams of fiber per day, but it just wasn’t cutting it. I was having an overnight oats and protein shake for breakfast every day, veggies with dinner, and drinking olipop at night to get a fiber boost. It worked at first… until it didn’t. 

Now I’m pooping with ease every morning with a few simple changes to my routine. 

1. Instead of cold overnight oats, I do warm oatmeal with a drizzle of olive oil (about 2 teaspoons). The warmth helps get things moving and the olive oil helps keep everything lubricated lol, and then I do a protein shake later in the morning so I still get my protein. 

2. If you need an extra boost, coffee is very helpful. If you’re like me and drink something else for caffeine (I’m addicted to Celsius…) just have a decaf cup of coffee and it’ll still help. 

3. 2 Kiwis and 6 prunes every evening after dinner. I think this might be the most important part of the new routine. Thanks to the kiwis and prunes, I no longer need MiraLAX or any laxatives. The prunes have the natural osmotic affect that you get from MiraLAX and the kiwis do too, and the kiwis also contain something that helps with motility which is what the laxatives do. Eat them at the same time every day after dinner. 

4. If you still need a boost even after trying all of these things for a few days, an evening olipop also seems to help, but I think you don’t want to have those every day. Plus they’re kind of expensive lol. 

If this advice helps just one person start pooping again, it will have been worth the time it took to type it out 😛

1r3u26i,https://v.redd.it/wriiadohiajg1,Coffee is for Closers,"“I got to drink a cup of coffee with Maxx this morning.”

That’s how new Raiders coach Klint Kubiak described his first meeting with the “disgruntled” face of the franchise.

In order to know how serious this Crosby crisis really is, we need to know what type of coffee they had.

I mean, if it was a Keurig K cup, that could’ve been a 90-second “how ya doin” meeting, which clearly leads to Maxx being traded in the next month.

But if it was a pour over coffee, which is where “hot water slowly drips through ground coffee beans in a filter, extracting flavor as it passes into a pot or carafe that’s below” — that could’ve taken 15-20 minutes, giving Maxx plenty of time to weigh in on which defensive lineman he wants the Raiders to take with the #1 overall pick.

Now based on the way Maxx plays the game, I could definitely see him as a Death Wish Coffee guy.  That brand offers “roughly six times more caffeine than a normal 12 ounce cup.”

And what I know about Kubiak, he strikes me as a Flat White — “double shot of espresso topped with a thin layer of silky, steamed milk”.

After all, he came from Seattle.

We may never find out the answer to this coffee mystery, but if Mark Davis pays for coffee machines like he pays for his former coaches, there is no way it was a Keurig.

For just $50, Amazon will deliver one to my kitchen in the next 22 minutes.

Now if it’s a quick cup of coffee you are looking for and you want it to feel special, definitely go with the Nespresso.

It’s “automatic… premium… high-quality … and ready in seconds.”

Just like Maxx.

Unfortunately we may have to wait until Jay Glazer or Dianna Russini get back from their post-Super Bowl vacation to find out exactly what Maxx is thinking.

From what we can tell, one day he wants a latte, the next day a cappuccino or americano or cortado or macchiato or maybe a mocha.

As for the Raiders, they have a new barista in town and after hearing Maxx’s order, they may just wanna switch to tea.",22,1771000756.0,raiders,8,0.82,False

On the first date I ran my usual DHV verbals but she would just nod or look down or to the side and nod and say ok. usually girls would be like ""wow"" and build on from there but this one just says ok, she also barely makes eye contact unless talking abt something she likes. At first seems like she was disinterested but she showed a few IOIs (indicators of interest)

First date just went for juice and then she had work afterwards, second date went to a coffee shop and I escalated a bit like hand on waist while walking and she complied, but didnt pull back home as she needed to meet friends afterwards, invited me but then i said I had to meet my friends in 30 min and then she kept saying ""u can go if u want"". so seemed like she wanted me gone so I left. She also called me awkward despite me carrying the verbals and her being a brick wall.

Like Im just confused now moving foward whether I should proceed as it feels like a beggar getting this girl out, but I usually like to run my leads like sales and work them down.
