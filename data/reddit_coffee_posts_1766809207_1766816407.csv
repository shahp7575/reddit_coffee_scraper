I recently made a post about casual weekend hangouts and got a few DMs already. Posting again to see if a few more people are interested so we can actually form a small group.

The idea is simple:

Chill weekend meetups
Coffee / food / walks / sports / random plans
No pressure, no weird vibes just normal people hanging out

If you’re:

New to the city
Bored of staying in every weekend
Or just want to meet a few like-minded folks

DM me. Once we hit around 10 people, I’ll make a group and we’ll take it from there.

Keeping it small initially to see how it goes and if it clicks, we can always bring more people in. Who knows, if it turns out good, maybe even a summer trip in April. Who's in?!",1,1766816350.0,BangaloreHouseParties,0,1.0,False

1pwqoaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1pwqoaz/want_to_go_nc_with_husbands_family/,Want to go NC with Husband's family,"Husband and I (both late 30s) argue a lot about this and it is draining! Please see reasons below: 

1. Visits: She does not visit us to visit us. She shows up with less than two weeks notice, wants us to drop plans with friends or our kids' events to see her. When we reached out on why the short notice or why can't they plan ahead with us, they said that they only come visit if there is nothing else going on with them (MIL is retired and healthy). They hold out to see if any of their friends might be available for the theater or hanging out with them before making plans to see us. They do not stay at our house when visiting. 

2. Gender comments: Since my son was born, she consistently has made comments about why girls are better and what a nightmare her boys were and are. How lucky that my SIL has all girls. How boys are difficult and dirty... When my daughter was born, there was a noticeable difference in how often she wanted to visit us. For her other grandkids, she attends their birthday parties, offers to babysit, and asks to attend events. For my kids, she has attended one school function, and 4 parties (birthday and baby shower) over 10 years. 

3. Gifts. MIL gives thoughtful and elaborate gifts to everyone except my kids and me. For my kids, she gives what she considers to be basic gifts (clothing and one toy item - often something they don't play with). For her other grand kids, she has given elaborate gifts with experiences, items, larger items for all of them to share at their own homes all in addition to her ""basics."" For me she has given me perfume (husband is allergic and she knows), old framed pictures that husband had given her when he was in college (she never put them up in her house- frame was damaged), and clothing that did not fit and was not returnable. It was a relief the years that she gave me nothing since it was one less thing to worry about.  

Why I think things went awry: 

1. MIL has favorites and my husband is NOT one. He is constantly wanting any attention she does give him. 

2. When we first got married, I reached out every time to try and accommodate her and ask her to go out for coffee or hang out with me. She never said yes and never asked me out, so I stopped reaching out about that. I use to send her and other family members pictures of the kids. At times she would respond with one word, other times not respond at all. I stopped sending pictures. She stopped picking up the phone when I called and didn't respond to messages. She said she was too busy and I should be understanding. I stopped messaging her first, so she never messaged me. She now says (to husband) that I should be the one reaching out to her.

I am heavily considering the Profitec Ride, and was wondering if there are ever sales for Profitec in the US. If there was a Christmas or New Years sale, I would likely buy now. I have heard good things about Clive Coffee, but so far only Lelit has come on sale.

Criteria:

1. Dual stainless steel boilers (longevity and lower risk of lead)
2. Pre-infusion configurable
3. Flow control optional
4. Size, the Drive is a little too big, although rotary pump tempting.
5. Faster heat times times

Coffee notes:

1. Milk drinks weekly
2. Mostly half calf
3. Monthly gatherings where 4 + shots and milk drinks may occur.
4. Usually medium and dark roast, but curious about light roasts.

Lelit Bianca v3 is a consideration too.

What should I do? 

She and I knew each other for 7 years now. At first, it was great, but after high school, it's becoming draining because I'm slowly realizing she sees only the good parts in me.

And I know I know, ""but isn't that great?""

It is.

Until it's not. Until she constantly puts me on a pedestal, complimenting me on how perfect my life is, how beautiful I am, how healthy my family is and, lastly, how she disregarded me completely when I'd opened up to her about my emotional/verbal abuse.

Recently, I just moved out of a toxic household and I finally gathered the courage to open up to her about a narcissistic family member of mine and I felt so relief because I've been wanting to tell her this, to let her in my life fully, and all I got was unnecessary advices I didn't ask for, excuses for why the family member did what they did to me and that it was for the good of me only. Even when my little cousin came in to tell more about my story, she just nodded, ""mm hm"" while scrolling on her phone and then later went back to herself ""so anyways, these bullies at my university—"" 

I've been thinking of just cutting her off completel, but at the same time, I still wanna believe she's gonna open her mind and heart to listen to me about this unspoken problem we apparently have. I do believe she atleast deserves some communication.

I hate how every time we meet up, she talks about herself all the time, her self improving journey to ""better herself"" (whatever that is) and I always listen and listen and listen, it's draining, I'd never complained, never disregarded her feelings, never defend against her. I feel bad for saying anything, because I know she's been through tough times in her life, but gradually, it just feels like I'm more her free therapist than her friends.

I am looking making new friends, if you find interesting, message me.

I enjoy cooking for peace of mind, used to like hiking trips. I enjoy swimming and taking long walks. I try to survive this life with coffee. I sometimes watch/re-watch anime , or listen to audiobooks or useless podcasts in weekends to pass time. Exploring new food/cuisine excites me more than watching a movie.

I currently don't have any pets, but love to adopt a cat some day.

I enjoy cooking as a hobby , I'm definitely not a professional. But I got into it as it reminds me of self value and consistently put efforts to improve myself. It's ok if it sounds a bit boring, but this particular hobby helped me a lot with my anxiety issues and making a routine.

Just for starting conversations, I am writing these questions, feel free to ask me anything that fancies ya.

How do you handle this world in times of self doubt , as everything is tuned towards repelling introverted people?

What is the last time one of your friends pissed you off and how did you handle it?

Share two happy moments in the past month.

# Baratza Encore: The Everyday Coffee Grinder

For many home baristas, the Baratza Encore is the gateway drug to truly exceptional coffee. It strikes that sweet spot between affordability and performance, consistently delivering a grind that punches above its weight class. If you're tired of inconsistent grinds from blade grinders or entry-level burr options, the Encore is likely the upgrade you've been waiting for.

What makes it so popular? It boils down to its robust build and user-friendly design. The conical burrs are capable of producing a surprisingly uniform grind across a wide spectrum, from coarse for French press to fine for espresso (though it excels more in the coarser ranges). The simple on/off button and pulse switch make operation straightforward, even when you're half-asleep before your first cup.

*   **Consistent Grind Quality:** The 40mm conical burrs provide a reliable grind suitable for most brewing methods.
*   **User-Friendly Operation:** Simple controls and easy cleaning make it a joy to use daily.
*   **Durable Construction:** Built with quality components, the Encore is designed to be a long-term kitchen companion.

Ready to taste the difference a quality grind makes? Explore the Baratza Encore and elevate your morning ritual.

1pwqi8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MUD/comments/1pwqi8h/tagmud_fallout_edition/,"""TAGMud"" (Fallout Edition)","\###.Project Overview: ""TAGMud"" (Fallout Edition)

We are building a Fallout-themed Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) running on the CoffeeMud engine, heavily customized to implement the mechanics of the Fallout 2d20 Tabletop RPG .



It is a text-based, multiplayer online role-playing game where players explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland, interacting with the world through a terminal-style interface.



\### Key Features & Mechanics

\- Authentic Fallout Interface :

  

  \- Login Screen : Modeled after a RobCo Industries Termlink terminal (Copyright 2075-2077).

  \- Score Display : A fully custom PIP-BOY 3000 interface that displays stats, status, and derived attributes like ""Caps"" and ""Weight"".

\- Character System (S.P.E.C.I.A.L.) :

  

  \- We have replaced the standard D&D-style stats with the Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system: S trength, P erception, E ndurance, C harisma, I ntelligence, A gility, and L uck.

  \- Derived Stats : Health Points (HP), Carry Weight, and Action Points are calculated using official 2d20 formulas (e.g., HP = Endurance + Luck ).

\- Races & Origins :

  

  \- Players can choose from iconic Fallout races, including Humans (Vault Dwellers, Wastelanders), Ghouls , Super Mutants , Synths , and Robots like Mister Handy and Protectrons .

  \- Each race has specific stat caps and traits (e.g., Robots don't heal naturally but need repairs).

\- Skills & Perks :

  

  \- The skill system includes classic Fallout skills: Small Guns , Big Guns , Energy Weapons , Science , Repair , Medicine , Lockpick , etc.

  \- Skill proficiency is calculated based on S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes (e.g., Small Guns = Agility ).

\- Economy & Items :

  

  \- Currency : The economy uses Bottle Caps (""caps"") instead of gold.

  \- Items : The world is populated with authentic items like Stimpaks , RadAway , Nuka-Cola , 10mm Pistols , and Combat Armor .

\### Current State

We are currently in the implementation and refinement phase . We have successfully integrated the core stats and score display, and we are now tuning the specific calculations (formulas) to ensure they perfectly match the tabletop ruleset. The game foundation is solid, and we are layering the specific Fallout flavor and mechanics on top of the robust CoffeeMud engine.

\###Deployment

We're starting off with Humans, Vault Dwellers, and racial classes in the beginning.  As people develop RP points to their accounts and the vault opens, new areas will open to the playerbase, which also involves new classes, races, and mechanics.  Vehicle on Vehicle combat, aerial combat, Power Armor, and the like.  (Mostly developed, not fully tested, kind of hard to shoot at yourself without dying.)

I'm well adept at taking ideas and coding them into the mud on whim. Server restarts will be minimized unless critical errors show up, which right now is 0.  Let me know if you're interested.  ",2,1766815551.0,MUD,0,1.0,False

Have become fast friends with this lovely gal. Both d\*kes and have known since young, for context. Been picking up on some signs that she may be interested, but have gotten contradictory signals mixed in there too. My running theory is she's still deciding herself how she feels, as it hasn't been tooo too long- a month and a half of friendship, the last two weeks of that being uber close. But I could be wrong and would love your input <3

EVIDENCE:

She offered to call me in the wake of my breakup from a short-term relationship. On the phone, I mentioned that I was craving in a partner someone I could talk to for hours, about topics ranging anywhere from trash reality TV to like, deeper philosophical musings. We talked until WELL after the consoling me part was over and she brought up a really obvious philosophical topic. Something about ""what are our thoughts"" hahah

COUNTER:

She mentioned her type is futches and I am pretty much not that. However, she did add that it ranges. Still, I know a celebrity crush of hers and I couldn't be further from that person, so I'm doubtful on how much it ranges.

EVIDENCE:

She is home visiting her family for the holidays and spent last night texting me back and forth (neither of us are big texters). She also called me this morning and said she'd call me later.

COUNTER:

She texted her friend recently she usually tries to stay away from blondes (I am blonde :() She was showing me something else in their text exchange and I accidentally peeped this message.

EVIDENCE:

We went and got coffee once and first of all, she was fixing her hair in a mirror as I was arriving and then put it away as I arrived. Secondly, on said ""date,"" she laughed at one point and reached fully across the table and grabbed both of my arms while laughing. Like it was not a convenient reach lol.

COUNTER:

Soon moving into this place; would really appreciate help with furniture layout, sizes, and decor choices. I want to do this right and avoid expensive mistakes.

Overall style that I like is: Natural dark wood, browns, nude, beige, white, black.

LIVING ROOM DETAILS

•	It’s a four-walled space

•	One wall is a grey accent wall with a TV mount

•	Opposite that is a soft white wall

•	One wall is a large balcony door (lots of natural light)

•	Fourth wall opens into the kitchen area

•	All doors in the apartment are black

Living room questions:

1.	Best sofa type for this layout: L-shaped, straight/long, or curved?

2.	Ideal sofa placement (what wall, how far from walls, floating vs pushed back)

3.	Best coffee table shape & size (round, oval, rectangular?)

4.	Where exactly should the coffee table and floor lamp go?

5.	Rug size: how big should it be relative to the sofa and table? (Should it go under the sofa legs or not?)

6.	Rug colors that work with wooden & beige sofas, grey walls, black doors, and natural light

7.	Curtain color and style for the balcony door (sheer vs full, warm white vs nude, ceiling-mounted or not)

8.	Any layout mistakes I should avoid in this kind of space?

I’m looking for practical layout advice, not just aesthetic inspiration. Any other suggestions would be appreciated too.

I go to sleep normally around 9:00pm and need to be up by 5:00/5:30 to get ready for work.

Similar situations have happened about 3 times over the last month, on work days and weekends so I dont think its stress. The last time all I did was make coffee and turned on the TV on a weekend. Then woke up at about 3:00am with nothing changed from how I went to bed and coffee mugs still in the cabinet. 

I dont know whats going on because im still well rested and feel good throughout the day, but the “dreams” feel so super real. ",1,1766814643.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Don’t get me wrong, I still love those things. But lately I’ve realized self-care is also doing the boring, uncomfortable stuff for myself.

It’s going to bed even when I want to scroll. It’s drinking water instead of another coffee. It’s not picking at my acne even when I’m stressed and staring at the mirror too long. It’s saying no when I’m tired and not explaining myself.

As a girl, I feel this pressure to always look put together and “soft,” but some days self-care is just surviving without being too hard on myself. I’m learning that I don’t have to glow up overnight. Healing, resting, and being kind to myself counts too.",4,1766814589.0,selfcare,1,0.83,False

Today was already a bad day and I (23f) have had it with my parents. There is no 'good' to being an obedient person in your family, especially if you're a woman. I really am not in the mood to go into an 'eldest daughter' rant though, so anyway.

I bought a jar of pistachio butter a few days ago, it was small but personally I use little amounts and majority of it for coffee so honestly it lasts a while, and it was an impulse purchase. Today apparently for breakfast, AD was gobbling it up and then he was wondering how much that jar was. Then he got pissed that I paid $7 for it, and it could've stopped there, but these are Asian parents we're talking about so it escalated into AD screaming at me for 'barely having any money in the first place to spend it'. Currently I work part-time as an after school teacher, and I already save 80% of my paycheck, god forbid i buy a $7 thing, AM was just as unhelpful, saying I deserved to be screamed at for this.

I made the mistake of trying to defend myself so it just triggered me more. After a while, they finally stopped yelling at me but I was just so angry I went to my room. I was even more mad because my brother is just as 'jobless' (im not blaming anyone for not having a job, this market is shit, but my brother is another flavor of weaponized incompetence) and has spent whatever little money he had on weed and has eaten beef (we're hindu). When you tell my parents this, he doesn't even get 5% of the anger I received. I can promise that if I was the one who bought weed and ate beef, my parents would've killed me.

I'm so fucking done and I'm like, genuinely this close to going to a shelter despite only working part-time. I'm also pissed in general because the winter holidays are absolutely the worst time, and I feel like no one is ever available if you need help.

**Minutes of the Board meeting of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH aboard the new geosync orbit hotel The Zenith Crown. c.205X**

The brand new Pod, a sleek white-and-gold projectile bearing the insignias of the 'Seven Sisters' of the new economy, detached from the Tether's main hub. Using micro-thrusters with surgical precision, it glided toward the docking spire of the Zenith Crown. As it crossed the proximity threshold, the hotel's magnetic tractor fields engaged, locking the luxury transit-module into the primary airlock.

The seven passengers who stepped onto the gantry were the new masters of the solar system—the CEOs and Chief Strategists of the supercorporations that had emerged from the ruins of the 20th-century industrial complex. Wearing fabrics woven from carbon-nanotubes and starlight-grade silk, they moved with the unhurried confidence of those who had privatized the high ground. A phalanx of hotel staff, trained in zero-g hospitality, guided them through the airlock and into the express lift.

Immediately, the lift descended into the great rotating ring of the station. As the centrifugal force ramped up to a comfortable 0.2g, the sense of weightlessness transitioned into a borough, god-like lightness—the exact physical sensation of floating above the masses.

They gathered in the Grand Chancellor conference suite. The room was a masterpiece of transparent aluminum, offering a panoramic voice of the Earth below, which looked like a fragile, glowing marble. The station’s rotation was perfectly timed to the terminator line, ensuring the room was bathed in a perpetual, golden twilight that masked the terrifying reality of the void outside.

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser, President and CEO of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH, officially opened the proceedings. ""Distinguished board members and strategic partners, I thank you for joining us for the formal commissioning of The Zenith Crown,"" he stated, met by polite applause. ""I am pleased to report that the S.L.A.M. Corporation has demonstrated exemplary compliance with all contractual obligations; their non-interference in our operational framework and personnel management remains absolute.

The fact that military investment has plummeted to zero has removed the governments as our biggest competitors. Their failure to oppose the new order has opened the world to us. Nobody has now the power to compete against the new mega-corporations, and our profits have exploded. (huge applauds)

As observed during our ascent, our proprietary luxury transit pods are fully integrated with the Tether’s electromagnetic rail. While the public continues to use the standardized high-capacity transit, our mandate remains focused on delivering the bespoke, premium-tier experience our discerning clientele expects—and for which they are prepared to pay a substantial premium."" (Restrained laughter echoed around the table).

""You will have ample opportunity to experience—and enjoy—the unparalleled amenities of this station during the following cycles. But for now, it is my distinct honor to introduce the Chairman of **Formosa Oceanic Holdings**, Mr. Lin-Wei Chen, the Taipei-based titan which has recently finalized the acquisition and total absorption of both **Carnival Corporation** and the **Royal Caribbean Group**. This strategic consolidation follows the period of... regrettable logistical paralysis... the United States was forced to endure during the previous years."" (Sustained, louder applause).

Lin-Wei Chen: ""Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all of you, my dearest friends. Today, I will introduce our new project, the **Grand Serenity**, which is in its final phase in our partner space shipyard, **Van der Meer Aerospace**."" (He offered a subtle, knowing smile toward the elegant lady on the side, Dr. Saskia van der Meer).

""The Grand Serenity is not merely a vessel; it is the first of its kind—a luxury solar-sail cruiser designed to traverse the silence between Earth and the moon in absolute comfort. By utilizing the new high-tensile filaments provided by S.L.A.M. and the exquisite craftsmanship of our Dutch partners, we are moving away from the era of 'transit' and into the era of 'voyage.' Our clients do not wish to merely arrive; they wish to inhabit the stars.""

""You are all well aware that our initial venture—a high-density transit corridor between Earth and the Lunar settlements—was brutally undercut. The S.L.A.M. introduction of the 'Magnetoplasmadynamic Drive' reduced transit times to a mere three hours. It was a logistical decapitation; they ignored every tentative reach for licensing or joint venture. In that sector, competition is an impossibility. But the luxury market is different. Reid is a man of few words, and while those words are law, he seems content to leave the aesthetics of the void to us... provided we pay our berth fees on time."" (A heavy, collective sigh moved around the table).

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser turned his gaze toward a woman sitting with military posture at the far end of the table. ""While we look to the sails of the future, we must also anchor our terrestrial desires. Ms. Sarah Sterling, representing our North American development consortium, will now provide us with an update on the 'Tranquility Base' project. This is to be the premiere hotel and entertainment complex on the Lunar surface—specifically situated in the Sea of Serenity, within respectful, yet highly lucrative, proximity to the original Apollo 11 landing site.""

Sarah Sterling inclined her head, her expression unreadable. ""The foundation is set, Dr. von Oberhauser. We are carving a sanctuary from the basalt. It is no longer a monument to a dead flag; it is a playground for the living elite.""

""We would have preferred to maintain total autonomy over our construction logistics,"" Sarah continued, her voice gaining a rare, vibrant edge of excitement. ""However, as Chairman Chen noted, the sheer efficiency of the S.L.A.M. orbital freight system made any other path an exercise in vanity. Their machines worked with a cold, terrifying perfection. Our crews, our refined materials, and our specialized life-support modules were delivered with surgical precision—on time, under budget, and with a professional detachment that is, frankly, invigorating. The speed of progress is staggering. Gentlemen, if this construction speed holds, our next board meeting will not be held in geosync orbit. We will be drinking this vintage while looking back at Earth from the surface of the Moon!"" (very loud applause).

Dr. von Oberhauser signaled toward the man seated to his left, whose fingers were absentmindedly tracing patterns on the surface of a sleek, translucent slate. ""And as we establish our presence on the surface, we must recognize the engines that power our interfaces. Mr. Akira Sato, CEO of **Neo-Kyoto Systems**, will speak to the initial output of the high-orbit foundries.""

Akira Sato adjusted his cuff, the fabric of his suit shimmering with an embedded circuitry pattern. ""The transition to the **Nexus-1** orbital factory has exceeded even our most aggressive internal projections,"" he began, his voice calm but vibrating with an unmistakable pride. ""In the absolute vacuum and zero-gravity of the high-orbit sector, we have achieved semiconductor purity levels previously thought to be theoretical. Our defect rate has effectively vanished. We are no longer manufacturing components; we are growing them in a state of crystalline perfection. This leap in quality has allowed us to capture 92% of the high-end quantum-processing market in a single fiscal quarter. Consequently, Neo-Kyoto's margins have widened by 40%, a testament to the fact that the void is not merely a frontier, but the ultimate clean-room."" (Nods of approval from the board).

""The pursuit of perfection is not limited to silicon,"" interjected Dr. Elena Varga, CEO of **Varga-Nordic Biopharma**, her voice possessing a sharp, clinical edge. ""The 'Aether-Lab' modules on the **Heisenberg Orbital Complex** have catalyzed a revolution in molecular synthesis. In the absence of gravitational sedimentation, we are harvesting protein crystals of unparalleled symmetry. We have successfully bioprinted complex vascular structures—hearts and kidneys that do not collapse under their own weight during the curing process. This 'orbital-grade' purity has allowed us to launch our Longevity-9 series. Demand from the terrestrial elite has reached a fever pitch; our pre-order margins are currently sitting at a record 55% per unit. We are no longer treating disease; we are refining human biology in a way that the ground simply would not allow.""

An older gentleman rose, his posture as rigid and precise as a balance sheet. He carried the unmistakable aura of a senior accountant, speaking in a monocord voice that lacked any perceptible emotional frequency. As the Chief Financial Officer for the consortium’s global endeavors, Mr. Kwesi Okonjo was the embodiment of fiscal caution, a man who viewed the world through the lens of risk assessment and long-term stability.

""As the fiduciary observer of our international interests,"" Mr. Okonjo began, his tone a steady, unvarying drone, ""I seek the Board’s collective appraisal on a development of recent note. While our internal projections suggest a neutral impact on immediate operational margins or share price volatility, the strategic shift is profound. I refer to the S.L.A.M. Corporation’s formal deployment of the new Void Space Credit, VSC in short.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser leaned in, the golden twilight of the cabin catching the edges of his spectacles. ""Please, Mr. Okonjo. We have observed the ripples of the S.L.A.M. announcement. We are awaiting your expertise to determine if this is a mere accounting convenience or the final decommissioning of the old financial world.""

""Thank you, Doctor. As the Board is aware, precisely one quarter ago, S.L.A.M. inaugurated a new sovereign medium of exchange to—and I quote—‘standardize extraterrestrial commerce and mitigate the systemic fracturing of the global monetary apparatus.’ In reality, this was the final nail in the coffin of American fiscal hegemony; the dollar’s status as a reserve asset was dismantled in a single week. The ‘spontaneous’ adoption of the VSC by the Eurozone, China, and India has set a precedent that a multitude of emerging markets are now following, adopting the Credit as their primary national tender. It is a purely digital architecture, absolute in its security and accessible via the most rudimentary consumer hardware—a prerequisite for those nations seeking to qualify for S.L.A.M. developmental grants and liquidity loans. Consequently, I formally propose that this consortium ratifies the immediate adoption of the Void Space Credit as our primary unit of account, and that we leverage our market position to mandate this transition across our entire network of strategic partners.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser scanned the room, his eyes lingering for a fraction of a second on each titan of industry. ""The motion is on the floor,"" he announced, his voice carrying the weight of the new world order. ""All those in opposition?""

The silence was absolute; not a single hand stirred.

""Abstentions?""

Again, the stillness of the room remained unbroken.

""The motion is carried unanimously,"" Oberhauser declared. ""Mr. Okonjo, you are authorized to initiate all necessary protocols for an immediate and seamless transition to the Void Space Credit across our entire infrastructure.""

He stood, the subtle click of his joints masked by the soft hum of the station’s environmental systems. ""And now, for the most essential item on today’s agenda: the inaugural lunch. If you would please follow me to the Grand Dining Hall.""

The room erupted in polite laughter and vigorous applause as the Masters of the Seven Sisters rose from their seats, their silk garments shimmering in the artificial twilight. One by one, they followed Oberhauser out of the suite, their hushed conversations already turning to the logistics of the lunar playground.

Mr. Kwesi Okonjo did not follow. He remained at the table, a solitary figure of rigid precision amidst the empty chairs. He waited until the heavy doors hissed shut, sealing him in the silence of the Grand Chancellor suite. Slowly, he reached for his glass of water. He did not drink. Instead, he raised the glass in a precise, measured salute toward the security sensor nestled in the ceiling.

""Long live the Empire,"" he whispered, his monocord voice finally betraying a hint of something resembling devotion. ""Long live the Emperor.""

High above, the small red light on the camera housing pulsed three times in silent, rhythmic acknowledgment.

**From the salvaged notes of Vann, P.I. c. 205X**

Vann sat in the back of a nondescript delivery van, the interior cramped and smelling of stale coffee and hot electronics. Outside, the tropical rain of Singapore hammered against the roof in a steady, deafening rhythm. He adjusted the gain on his monitor, watching the main exit of the S.L.A.M. Space Station—the massive, high-security terminal adjacent to Changi that served as the heartbeat of the orbital elevator.

""Target is moving,"" Vann wrote in his notebook, with date and time.

A black, armored sedan pulled away from the private gantry, followed by two dark SUVs filled with Peacekeepers—human beings in crisp, charcoal S.L.A.M. uniforms, their faces visible and disciplined. They didn't need active-camouflage to be intimidating; the SLAM patch on their shoulders did the work for them.

Vann pulled out into the late-afternoon traffic, keeping three cars back.

The tail was long and careful. They left the neon glow of the airport district, heading toward the lush, older wealth of Bukit Timah. This was the territory of the old money, the place where the Azure Dragon triad had once ruled from behind high walls.

They reached the gates of the Empress’s Garden.

Vann remembered the stories of how Reid had taken this place from the mob in a single night. The high stone walls were the same, but the barbed wire had been replaced by elegant, recessed sensors and climbing jasmine. It was no longer a fortress for criminals; it was a sanctuary.

Vann hopped out of the van two blocks early, moving through the shadows of the rain-slicked trees. He climbed the ridge overlooking the estate, settling into a position where he could see over the perimeter. He pulled a high-powered optical rig from his bag—real glass, real sensors. No drones.

He zoomed in on the main courtyard.

Clarissa Tang stepped out of the sedan. The Peacekeepers fanned out with practiced efficiency, securing the perimeter of the house that had once been a den of murder. She looked composed, her white suit a sharp contrast against the dark, wet stone of the driveway.

Vann adjusted his parabolic mic, aiming it at the heavy oak doors. He just needed a name, a fragment of conversation—anything Lao Feng could use as a lever.

Vann watched as the heavy doors of the main residence opened. He expected a servant, or perhaps a final security sweep. Instead, two small streaks of color—twins, a boy and a girl no more than three years old—erupted from the house. Their high, joyful shouts carried faintly through the mic.

Clarissa didn't just greet them; she dropped her bag and knelt on the wet stone, catching them both in a fierce, enthusiastic embrace.

Vann’s mind raced, frantically flipping through every decrypted file and Triad rumor he had ever memorized. *Children.* There was nothing in the Iron Fang dossiers about heirs. No birth certificates in the Singapore registries, no sightings at the SLAM medical centers. In the eyes of the world, Clarissa Tang was the ""White Widow,"" a solitary figure bound to a husband who lived thirty-six thousand kilometers above the dirt.

Then a man stepped out from the warm amber light of the foyer. He wasn't Georges Reid. He was younger, Asian, dressed in a simple linen shirt. He walked toward Clarissa with a familiar, easy grace, reaching down to help her up before kissing her with a quiet, domestic intimacy.

Vann felt a chill that had nothing to do with the Singapore rain. He wasn't looking at a simple affair; he was looking at the ultimate logistical redirection. The ""Empire"" was a shield. The marriage to the God-Emperor was a front, a hollow shell designed to protect this—a real life, a real family, hidden in the very heart of the storm.

Vann pulled back from the rig, his hands trembling. He realized with a terrifying clarity that he hadn't found leverage for Lao Feng. He had found a secret so dangerous that the mere act of witnessing it had effectively marked him for erasure.

His fingers worked the shutter with a clinical, frantic rhythm, capturing the frames that would burn the world down: the man’s profile, the children’s laughter, the Empress’s unguarded smile. He didn't upload to the cloud—S.L.A.M. owned the sky, and anything transmitted would be intercepted before it reached the first relay. Instead, he pulled the physical encrypted cards, tucking into a lead-lined pouch sewn into his belt.

He didn't return to the van. The van was a beacon, a fixed point in a city governed by predictive algorithms. He ghosted down the back of the ridge, abandoning the heavy rig in a drainage culvert and sliding into the humid, evening shadows of Bukit Timah Road.

Vann didn't hail an auto-cab. He walked until his lungs burned, merging into the anonymity of a crowded bus stop. He caught the 170, the rhythmic hiss of the air-brakes sounding like a countdown. He watched the reflections in the window, scanning every face, every black sedan that lingered a second too long in the neighboring lane.

At Little India, he hopped off before the doors fully closed, cutting through the spice-scented maze of the Tekka Centre to catch a cross-town line heading toward Geylang. He switched three times—bus to MRT, MRT to a different bus—utilizing the chaotic density of the evening rush to bleach his trail. Every time he stepped onto a new platform, he felt the weight of the data against his hip, a radioactive secret that made the neon lights of the city feel like a thousand searching eyes.

By the time he reached the outskirts of his cheap hotel, his shirt was plastered to his back with cold sweat. He didn't use the elevator. He took the service stairs, his hand never leaving the knife at his waist.

At the fourth-floor landing, he paused, back flat against the concrete wall, listening to the hum of the vending machine and the distant mumble of a television. He moved to Room 412. He didn't reach for the handle. He knelt, his eyes inches from the doorframe. The single, grey hair he had wedged into the hinge was still there—undisturbed, a microscopic line of defense.

Inside, he stayed in the shadows, letting the door click shut with a soft, mechanical finality. He didn't reach for the light. Instead, he pulled a small, air-gapped tablet from a hollowed-out floorboard. He reviewed the loop from the pinhole camera he’d hidden in the fire extinguisher across the hall. He scrolled through hours of grainy, low-light footage: a cleaning droid, a couple of tourists, the flickering fluorescent light. No intruders. No ""polite men in suits"" with Phoenix pins.

The paranoia was a physical weight, a constant tension in his jaw. To go against S.L.A.M. was to go against a God that monitored the very pulse of the planet. Every digital footprint was a breadcrumb; every wireless signal was a flare.

He sat at the small, scarred wooden desk. He ignored his laptop. Instead, he pulled a heavy, leather-bound notebook and a fountain pen from his pack. Analog. Old world. No metadata, no IP logs, no ghost in the machine to betray him. The scratching of the nib was the only sound in the room as he began to transcribe the impossible.

*Subject: The Empress’s Garden. Findings: The ""White Widow"" is a logistical fabrication. Heirs confirmed. Secondary subject identified: Non-Imperial male, Asian, domestic partner. The Emperor's official life is a diversion—a global-scale protection detail.*

He stared at the ink as it dried, black and permanent. He was holding the match that could ignite a war, and in the silence of the room, he realized that for the first time in his career, he was truly afraid of the dark.

Vann knew the digital archives were a minefield. S.L.A.M. didn't just delete history; they rewrote it in real-time. If he wanted the truth, he needed the fragments they'd missed—the physical leftovers and the un-scrubbed memories of a city that had been bought and sold a dozen times over.

He left the hotel before dawn, heading for the National Library’s basement—not the sleek, digitized upper floors, but the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. He spent six hours in the dust-choked microfilm stacks, his eyes burning from the flicker of the old projectors. He was looking for the night of the ""Azure Dragon"" collapse, the moment the power shifted from the street to the Spire.

He found it in a scanned copy of an old Mount Elizabeth Hospital psychiatric ward intake form, buried in a defunct medical database. A witness statement: Maria Santos. A domestic helper who had seen the world break inside the Bukit Timah house.

*“The young masters... they leave us... Jian, betrayer ?”*

The words were a hammer blow. Vann cross-referenced the name ""Jian"" with old syndicate personnel files he’d been given. He found a match in a high-res photo of a Azure Dragon low-level enforcer who had vanished the same week Georges Reid married Clarissa Tang. The facial architecture was a ninety-eight percent match for the man he’d seen through the rig at the Garden.

He dug deeper, shifting to the ""Shadow Ledger"" audit reports from the early 204X period. He found the redacted Clause 14-B of the SPBG loan. The default condition: the transfer of Clarissa Tang to the Azure Dragon as ""collateral.""

Vann sat back, the cool air of the library basement feeling like ice on his skin. He understood the math now. The God-Emperor hadn't just saved the bank; he had purchased the freedom of the woman he loved—or perhaps the woman he respected enough to give everything back to. He had liquidated a triad, erased a debt, and provided a global-scale alibi so Clarissa could live in the shadows with her real partner, while he became the ""Silence in the Heavens.""

The twins weren't just heirs; they were the biological proof of a massive, multi-billion credit deception. Every piece of S.L.A.M. propaganda, every ""White Widow"" mourning gown, every speech about the ""divine isolation"" of the Emperor was a security layer for a family that officially didn't exist.

Vann closed the notebook. He had the proof. He had the names. He had the man. But as he looked at the exit, he realized that this information didn't make him a kingmaker for Lao Feng. It made him a loose thread in a tapestry woven by a mind that could calculate the flight path of a B-21 or the collapse of a carrier fleet while eating a pastry.

He wasn't an investigator anymore. He was a witness to a god's personal secret, and in Singapore, the penalty for that was rarely a trial. It was simply the lack of memory of you after being deleted.

He had forgotten the clerk. The man in the library basement was a ghost of a different kind—a paper-pusher whose only loyalty was to the system's log-in screen. After Vann stepped into the oppressive humidity of the street, the clerk’s fingers danced across a keyboard, logging the request into a centralized security index as he had done every day for twenty years. *Subject: Azure Dragon. Case File: OP-DRAGON-FALL.* In a city where the S.L.A.M. grid parsed every byte of data, Vann’s analog curiosity had just left a digital scar.

Back in Room 412, the air was stale. Vann moved with a mechanical, frantic rhythm. Check the hair. Check the loop. Scan for the hidden pulse of a sleeper bug. He sat at the desk, hardening the report with the final, damning details—Jian, the dates, the connection to the Celestial Way. Every word felt like a death warrant.

He didn't sleep. He sat in the dark, watching the red eye of the fire alarm, listening for the sound of an elevator that didn't stop at the fourth floor. At 04:00, he opened a burner browser and booked a one-way flight to Shanghai using a dead man’s credit line. He had to be off the island before the cleaners realized the leak wasn't just digital. He was a loose variable in an empire that didn't tolerate math errors.

Changi Airport was a sprawling cathedral of glass and steel, every biometric sensor and automated gate feeling like a cold, electronic snare. Vann moved through the terminal with the blank, invisible stare of a man who didn't exist, his heart a rhythmic hammer against his ribs. He didn't relax when he cleared the final security gate. He didn't relax as he scanned the crowd for the tell-tale stillness of a tail.

He only felt the first, thin tremor of relief when he stepped into the jet bridge for the 06:15 to Shanghai. The climate-controlled tunnel was a vacuum, a physical transition zone between the city that wanted him erased and the aircraft that would carry him into the chaos of the mainland.

A young woman walked a few paces ahead of him—beautiful, elegantly dressed in a light trench coat, her blonde hair catching the overhead fluorescents. She moved with a slight, graceful hurry. Ten feet from the aircraft door, she stumbled. Her leather shoulder bag slipped, hitting the carpeted floor and spilling a chaotic collection of travel documents and personal items.

It was the vestigial reflex of a life lived before the Empire—a final, fatal lapse into chivalry. Vann stepped forward, bending down gallantly to retrieve a fallen passport.

The woman didn't thank him. She didn't even turn around.

As Vann reached for the document, he felt it—a sharp, clinical sting at the base of his skull, just beneath the hairline. It was the precise, cold puncture of a pressurized injector.

His vision didn't blur; it simply extinguished. The last thing he felt wasn't the carpet or the bag, but the sudden, heavy silence of the void. In the heart of the empire, the variable had finally been reconciled.

A few nights later, in the sprawling, gilded estate of the Lao family in Shanghai, the silence of the pre-dawn hours was broken by a thin, rhythmic sound.

It was the crying of a newborn. A soft, wet whimpering that drifted through the heavy silk curtains of the nursery.

The daughter of Lao Feng stirred in her sleep, the maternal instinct cutting through the fog of exhaustion. She rose, her silk nightgown whispering against the mahogany floorboards, and moved toward the crib. The air in the room felt unnaturally cold, heavy with a metallic, copper scent that made the back of her throat itch.

""Hush now,"" she whispered, her voice thick with sleep. ""Mama is here.""

She reached into the crib, her hand searching for the warmth of her child beneath the hand-embroidered covers. Her fingers touched something cold. Something hard. It wasn't the soft yielding of a baby’s cheek, but the rigid, waxy texture of frozen skin.

The crying stopped instantly, as if a switch had been flipped.

With a sudden, sickening jolt of adrenaline, she threw back the coverlet.

She didn't scream. Not at first. The horror was too total for sound.

Staring up from the center of the white silk mattress was a human head. The skin had been drained to the color of bone, the lips pulled back in a final, silent snarl of terror. The eyes were wide, pinned open with surgical precision, the glassy pupils fixed on the ceiling.

Beneath the severed neck, the crib was a lake of thick, congealing darkness. The baby's white lace gown was saturated, the fabric heavy and sodden with blood that had been poured into the small space like a ritual offering. The infant lay silent, its small body partially obscured by the weight of the man's head, its face smeared with the same dark, iron-scented ruin.

Then the shriek came—a jagged, animal sound that tore through the Lao estate, shattering the silence of the Shanghai night.



**The Underworld: Night in the Pearl of the Orient**

The air in The Gilded Paradox was thick enough to chew—a toxic cocktail of high-end cigar smoke, expensive French cognac, and the lingering scent of sex. Deep in the bowels of the Shanghai Bund, far beneath the soaring maglev tracks and the glowing holos of the S.L.A.M. energy grid, the old world was still breathing, heavy and ragged.

In the VIP sanctum, the walls were lined with silk the color of dried blood. Three men sat in a semicircle of leather armchairs, their faces half-shrouded in the dim, amber glow of a single recessed lantern.

To the left sat Lao Feng, the ""Great Ghost"" of the Iron Fang Triad. He was a man made of scars and expensive linen, representing the mainland's unrefined muscle. Opposite him was Hsieh ""The Serpent"" Kai, a slim, tailored figure from Taipei’s Celestial Way Syndicate, his fingers idly tracing the rim of a crystal glass. Between them sat Oyabun Kenjiro Sato, a man who carried the weight of the Kuro-ryu Clan like a burial shroud, his eyes like polished obsidian.

Lao Feng didn't look at his guests. He looked at the three girls kneeling by the low teak table, their bodies painted in shimmering gold leaf, pouring tea with trembling hands. With a single, sharp flick of his wrist—a gesture that had sent men to their deaths for thirty years—he signaled the room.

The girls retreated instantly, disappearing through the heavy velvet curtains. The personal servant, a man who looked like he’d been built from granite, bowed once and pulled the heavy soundproof doors shut. The silence that followed was heavy, punctuated only by the distant, rhythmic thrum of the city's heartbeat.

Lao Feng leaned forward, the shadows dancing in the hollows of his cheeks. ""The billionaires in the sky are celebrating their new credits,"" he rasped, his voice sounding like sandpaper on stone. ""They think they’ve privatized the stars. But they’ve forgotten one thing.""

Oyabun Sato reached into his kimono, producing a small, obsidian-black datapad. ""They have forgotten that every empire has a gutter,"" he whispered. ""And we are the ones who own the gutter.""

Sato leaned into the light, a cold, predatory gleam in his eyes. ""The Kuro-ryu are ready for the first harvest. The pipes are primed. Our associates at Varga-Nordic—those ice-cold professionals at V.N.B.—did exactly what they were paid for. They tucked a ghost-lab right into the guts of the Heisenberg plan. We’re going to be cooking our own brand of 'medicine' within thirty days. Out there in the void, where gravity doesn't exist to mess with the molecules, the purity is so high it’ll make your soul ache. It’s through the roof.""

He took a slow, deliberate sip of his tea. ""And the best part? The transit. Every container heading back to the mud is going to be handled transparently—ghosts in the machine. Thanks to Reid’s big shiny elevator, the price per container is a rounding error on a dead man’s tab. We aren't just selling a product anymore; we're selling the only thing the Emperor can't tax.""

Hsieh Kai smiled, a thin, predatory expression. ""The Emperor built a shining ladder to the stars. He forgot that the brighter he burns, the deeper the shadows grow—and the shadows are our home.""

Hsieh swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching the light fracture against the crystal. ""Singapore is a dead-end,"" he said, his voice as thin and sharp as a switchblade. ""Out of the Lion City, we can’t touch those automated S.L.A.M. freighters. A pity, too—they’re fast as a bullet and twice as quiet. We tried testing the waters with three dummy shipments. They didn't just go missing; they were deleted. No physical trace, and the S.L.A.M. central server says they never existed in the first place. It’s like trying to smuggle past a god—he doesn’t just take your cargo; he takes the memory of it.""

He leaned in, the shadows pooling in his eyes. ""The last bagman we sent to find the leak? They found him in a Geylang dive, drugged into tomorrow and tangled up with an underage ghost who evaporated the second the door was kicked in. He’s awaiting a date with a firing squad for a crime that was never on paper. So, we do it the hard way. The long walk. New maglev to Thailand, slow-boat to Canada, then a crawl across the border into the States. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and it's ugly. HE seems aware, but do not give a shit.""

Lao Feng grunted, a sound like gravel turning in a cement mixer. ""After Hsieh’s little ghost story, we thought we’d get cute. We went looking for a handle on Clarissa Tang. We reached out to that *lǎo bù sǐ*—the old bastard running the Azure Dragon in Hong Kong. You know what he gave us? A laugh that sounded like a death rattle and a dial tone. That was the end of the conversation.""

He paused, his eyes narrowing into slits. ""I sent a professional. A P.I. with a clean record and a dirty mind. He dug. He found something, alright. But he didn’t make the hand-off. My daughter found his head tucked under the covers in my grandson’s bedroom, staring at the ceiling with wide, dead eyes. That was the message. Loud and clear.""

He leaned back, the leather of his chair creaking like a hanging rope. ""From now on, we don’t walk near the Reid family. We don’t even look at their shadow. As Hsieh said, the Emperor knows we’re here, and he doesn’t care as long as we stay in the mud. But I’ll tell you this—I’m waiting for the day a polite little man in a suit with a Phoenix pin on his lapel comes knocking, asking for a 'contribution.'""

The air in the room got ten degrees colder. All three men felt the horror of potential extortion, something they had all some experience in.

The tension didn't break; it just curdled into a different kind of hunger. At a grunt from Lao Feng, the soundproof doors hissed open and the night truly began. Platters of raw, marbled beef and crystal bowls of synthetic stimulants appeared as if summoned from the ether. The gold-leafed girls returned, moving with the silent, practiced grace of clockwork dolls.

For the next two hours, the ""Gilded Paradox"" lived up to its name. The three masters of the gutter indulged in the spoils of their shadowy domain—expensive cognac flowed like water, and the air turned blue with the smoke of cigars that cost more than a common laborer made in a year. They took what and who they wanted, when they wanted, a desperate display of power in a world where they were increasingly becoming relics.

Finally, as the first grey light of a Shanghai dawn began to bleed through the Bund, the men filtered out. Lao Feng left with his Granite-built shadow; Sato and Kai vanished into the neon rain of the street, their security details materializing from the alleys like ghosts.

The room was left in a state of expensive ruin—tipped glasses, scattered ash, and the lingering scent of spent adrenaline. A team of faceless cleaners moved in, their movements efficient and robotic. They scrubbed the silk, polished the teak, and erased the physical memory of the night’s debauchery in under twenty minutes.

One of the gold-painted girls remained after the others had vanished. She checked the seal on the heavy doors, then walked to a far corner of the room where the wall seemed empty. There, partially hidden by the shifting ambers of the recessed lanterns, was a delicate, ink-wash painting of a dragon coiling through storm clouds.

The girl lowered her head, her posture shifting from that of a servant to one of profound, religious devotion. She bowed deeply toward the dragon.

“Long live the Empire. Long live the Emperor,” she whispered into the silence.

High above the clouds, the small red eye of the dragon in the painting pulsed three times in rhythmic, silent acknowledgment.

I needed to buy a coffee grinder for I and after some research I saw the Kmart coffee grinder for $32 was the best priced that was able to let you choose which grind you wanted.

after no luck in click and collect. I decided to order online.

the grinder came on 24th Dec. I noticed the tape of the box had been opened before and resealed. I thought oh I must have gotten a change of mind return. no big deal 

I opened and it had clearly been used.

the biggest giveaway was the motor smelled like it had blown. you all kno that smell.

**Minutes of the Board meeting of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH aboard the new geosync orbit hotel The Zenith Crown. c.205X**

The brand new Pod, a sleek white-and-gold projectile bearing the insignias of the 'Seven Sisters' of the new economy, detached from the Tether's main hub. Using micro-thrusters with surgical precision, it glided toward the docking spire of the Zenith Crown. As it crossed the proximity threshold, the hotel's magnetic tractor fields engaged, locking the luxury transit-module into the primary airlock.

The seven passengers who stepped onto the gantry were the new masters of the solar system—the CEOs and Chief Strategists of the supercorporations that had emerged from the ruins of the 20th-century industrial complex. Wearing fabrics woven from carbon-nanotubes and starlight-grade silk, they moved with the unhurried confidence of those who had privatized the high ground. A phalanx of hotel staff, trained in zero-g hospitality, guided them through the airlock and into the express lift.

Immediately, the lift descended into the great rotating ring of the station. As the centrifugal force ramped up to a comfortable 0.2g, the sense of weightlessness transitioned into a borough, god-like lightness—the exact physical sensation of floating above the masses.

They gathered in the Grand Chancellor conference suite. The room was a masterpiece of transparent aluminum, offering a panoramic voice of the Earth below, which looked like a fragile, glowing marble. The station’s rotation was perfectly timed to the terminator line, ensuring the room was bathed in a perpetual, golden twilight that masked the terrifying reality of the void outside.

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser, President and CEO of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH, officially opened the proceedings. ""Distinguished board members and strategic partners, I thank you for joining us for the formal commissioning of The Zenith Crown,"" he stated, met by polite applause. ""I am pleased to report that the S.L.A.M. Corporation has demonstrated exemplary compliance with all contractual obligations; their non-interference in our operational framework and personnel management remains absolute.

The fact that military investment has plummeted to zero has removed the governments as our biggest competitors. Their failure to oppose the new order has opened the world to us. Nobody has now the power to compete against the new mega-corporations, and our profits have exploded. (huge applauds)

As observed during our ascent, our proprietary luxury transit pods are fully integrated with the Tether’s electromagnetic rail. While the public continues to use the standardized high-capacity transit, our mandate remains focused on delivering the bespoke, premium-tier experience our discerning clientele expects—and for which they are prepared to pay a substantial premium."" (Restrained laughter echoed around the table).

""You will have ample opportunity to experience—and enjoy—the unparalleled amenities of this station during the following cycles. But for now, it is my distinct honor to introduce the Chairman of **Formosa Oceanic Holdings**, Mr. Lin-Wei Chen, the Taipei-based titan which has recently finalized the acquisition and total absorption of both **Carnival Corporation** and the **Royal Caribbean Group**. This strategic consolidation follows the period of... regrettable logistical paralysis... the United States was forced to endure during the previous years."" (Sustained, louder applause).

Lin-Wei Chen: ""Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all of you, my dearest friends. Today, I will introduce our new project, the **Grand Serenity**, which is in its final phase in our partner space shipyard, **Van der Meer Aerospace**."" (He offered a subtle, knowing smile toward the elegant lady on the side, Dr. Saskia van der Meer).

""The Grand Serenity is not merely a vessel; it is the first of its kind—a luxury solar-sail cruiser designed to traverse the silence between Earth and the moon in absolute comfort. By utilizing the new high-tensile filaments provided by S.L.A.M. and the exquisite craftsmanship of our Dutch partners, we are moving away from the era of 'transit' and into the era of 'voyage.' Our clients do not wish to merely arrive; they wish to inhabit the stars.""

""You are all well aware that our initial venture—a high-density transit corridor between Earth and the Lunar settlements—was brutally undercut. The S.L.A.M. introduction of the 'Magnetoplasmadynamic Drive' reduced transit times to a mere three hours. It was a logistical decapitation; they ignored every tentative reach for licensing or joint venture. In that sector, competition is an impossibility. But the luxury market is different. Reid is a man of few words, and while those words are law, he seems content to leave the aesthetics of the void to us... provided we pay our berth fees on time."" (A heavy, collective sigh moved around the table).

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser turned his gaze toward a woman sitting with military posture at the far end of the table. ""While we look to the sails of the future, we must also anchor our terrestrial desires. Ms. Sarah Sterling, representing our North American development consortium, will now provide us with an update on the 'Tranquility Base' project. This is to be the premiere hotel and entertainment complex on the Lunar surface—specifically situated in the Sea of Serenity, within respectful, yet highly lucrative, proximity to the original Apollo 11 landing site.""

Sarah Sterling inclined her head, her expression unreadable. ""The foundation is set, Dr. von Oberhauser. We are carving a sanctuary from the basalt. It is no longer a monument to a dead flag; it is a playground for the living elite.""

""We would have preferred to maintain total autonomy over our construction logistics,"" Sarah continued, her voice gaining a rare, vibrant edge of excitement. ""However, as Chairman Chen noted, the sheer efficiency of the S.L.A.M. orbital freight system made any other path an exercise in vanity. Their machines worked with a cold, terrifying perfection. Our crews, our refined materials, and our specialized life-support modules were delivered with surgical precision—on time, under budget, and with a professional detachment that is, frankly, invigorating. The speed of progress is staggering. Gentlemen, if this construction speed holds, our next board meeting will not be held in geosync orbit. We will be drinking this vintage while looking back at Earth from the surface of the Moon!"" (very loud applause).

Dr. von Oberhauser signaled toward the man seated to his left, whose fingers were absentmindedly tracing patterns on the surface of a sleek, translucent slate. ""And as we establish our presence on the surface, we must recognize the engines that power our interfaces. Mr. Akira Sato, CEO of **Neo-Kyoto Systems**, will speak to the initial output of the high-orbit foundries.""

Akira Sato adjusted his cuff, the fabric of his suit shimmering with an embedded circuitry pattern. ""The transition to the **Nexus-1** orbital factory has exceeded even our most aggressive internal projections,"" he began, his voice calm but vibrating with an unmistakable pride. ""In the absolute vacuum and zero-gravity of the high-orbit sector, we have achieved semiconductor purity levels previously thought to be theoretical. Our defect rate has effectively vanished. We are no longer manufacturing components; we are growing them in a state of crystalline perfection. This leap in quality has allowed us to capture 92% of the high-end quantum-processing market in a single fiscal quarter. Consequently, Neo-Kyoto's margins have widened by 40%, a testament to the fact that the void is not merely a frontier, but the ultimate clean-room."" (Nods of approval from the board).

""The pursuit of perfection is not limited to silicon,"" interjected Dr. Elena Varga, CEO of **Varga-Nordic Biopharma**, her voice possessing a sharp, clinical edge. ""The 'Aether-Lab' modules on the **Heisenberg Orbital Complex** have catalyzed a revolution in molecular synthesis. In the absence of gravitational sedimentation, we are harvesting protein crystals of unparalleled symmetry. We have successfully bioprinted complex vascular structures—hearts and kidneys that do not collapse under their own weight during the curing process. This 'orbital-grade' purity has allowed us to launch our Longevity-9 series. Demand from the terrestrial elite has reached a fever pitch; our pre-order margins are currently sitting at a record 55% per unit. We are no longer treating disease; we are refining human biology in a way that the ground simply would not allow.""

An older gentleman rose, his posture as rigid and precise as a balance sheet. He carried the unmistakable aura of a senior accountant, speaking in a monocord voice that lacked any perceptible emotional frequency. As the Chief Financial Officer for the consortium’s global endeavors, Mr. Kwesi Okonjo was the embodiment of fiscal caution, a man who viewed the world through the lens of risk assessment and long-term stability.

""As the fiduciary observer of our international interests,"" Mr. Okonjo began, his tone a steady, unvarying drone, ""I seek the Board’s collective appraisal on a development of recent note. While our internal projections suggest a neutral impact on immediate operational margins or share price volatility, the strategic shift is profound. I refer to the S.L.A.M. Corporation’s formal deployment of the new Void Space Credit, VSC in short.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser leaned in, the golden twilight of the cabin catching the edges of his spectacles. ""Please, Mr. Okonjo. We have observed the ripples of the S.L.A.M. announcement. We are awaiting your expertise to determine if this is a mere accounting convenience or the final decommissioning of the old financial world.""

""Thank you, Doctor. As the Board is aware, precisely one quarter ago, S.L.A.M. inaugurated a new sovereign medium of exchange to—and I quote—‘standardize extraterrestrial commerce and mitigate the systemic fracturing of the global monetary apparatus.’ In reality, this was the final nail in the coffin of American fiscal hegemony; the dollar’s status as a reserve asset was dismantled in a single week. The ‘spontaneous’ adoption of the VSC by the Eurozone, China, and India has set a precedent that a multitude of emerging markets are now following, adopting the Credit as their primary national tender. It is a purely digital architecture, absolute in its security and accessible via the most rudimentary consumer hardware—a prerequisite for those nations seeking to qualify for S.L.A.M. developmental grants and liquidity loans. Consequently, I formally propose that this consortium ratifies the immediate adoption of the Void Space Credit as our primary unit of account, and that we leverage our market position to mandate this transition across our entire network of strategic partners.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser scanned the room, his eyes lingering for a fraction of a second on each titan of industry. ""The motion is on the floor,"" he announced, his voice carrying the weight of the new world order. ""All those in opposition?""

The silence was absolute; not a single hand stirred.

""Abstentions?""

Again, the stillness of the room remained unbroken.

""The motion is carried unanimously,"" Oberhauser declared. ""Mr. Okonjo, you are authorized to initiate all necessary protocols for an immediate and seamless transition to the Void Space Credit across our entire infrastructure.""

He stood, the subtle click of his joints masked by the soft hum of the station’s environmental systems. ""And now, for the most essential item on today’s agenda: the inaugural lunch. If you would please follow me to the Grand Dining Hall.""

The room erupted in polite laughter and vigorous applause as the Masters of the Seven Sisters rose from their seats, their silk garments shimmering in the artificial twilight. One by one, they followed Oberhauser out of the suite, their hushed conversations already turning to the logistics of the lunar playground.

Mr. Kwesi Okonjo did not follow. He remained at the table, a solitary figure of rigid precision amidst the empty chairs. He waited until the heavy doors hissed shut, sealing him in the silence of the Grand Chancellor suite. Slowly, he reached for his glass of water. He did not drink. Instead, he raised the glass in a precise, measured salute toward the security sensor nestled in the ceiling.

""Long live the Empire,"" he whispered, his monocord voice finally betraying a hint of something resembling devotion. ""Long live the Emperor.""

High above, the small red light on the camera housing pulsed three times in silent, rhythmic acknowledgment.

**From the salvaged notes of Vann, P.I. c. 205X**

Vann sat in the back of a nondescript delivery van, the interior cramped and smelling of stale coffee and hot electronics. Outside, the tropical rain of Singapore hammered against the roof in a steady, deafening rhythm. He adjusted the gain on his monitor, watching the main exit of the S.L.A.M. Space Station—the massive, high-security terminal adjacent to Changi that served as the heartbeat of the orbital elevator.

""Target is moving,"" Vann wrote in his notebook, with date and time.

A black, armored sedan pulled away from the private gantry, followed by two dark SUVs filled with Peacekeepers—human beings in crisp, charcoal S.L.A.M. uniforms, their faces visible and disciplined. They didn't need active-camouflage to be intimidating; the SLAM patch on their shoulders did the work for them.

Vann pulled out into the late-afternoon traffic, keeping three cars back.

The tail was long and careful. They left the neon glow of the airport district, heading toward the lush, older wealth of Bukit Timah. This was the territory of the old money, the place where the Azure Dragon triad had once ruled from behind high walls.

They reached the gates of the Empress’s Garden.

Vann remembered the stories of how Reid had taken this place from the mob in a single night. The high stone walls were the same, but the barbed wire had been replaced by elegant, recessed sensors and climbing jasmine. It was no longer a fortress for criminals; it was a sanctuary.

Vann hopped out of the van two blocks early, moving through the shadows of the rain-slicked trees. He climbed the ridge overlooking the estate, settling into a position where he could see over the perimeter. He pulled a high-powered optical rig from his bag—real glass, real sensors. No drones.

He zoomed in on the main courtyard.

Clarissa Tang stepped out of the sedan. The Peacekeepers fanned out with practiced efficiency, securing the perimeter of the house that had once been a den of murder. She looked composed, her white suit a sharp contrast against the dark, wet stone of the driveway.

Vann adjusted his parabolic mic, aiming it at the heavy oak doors. He just needed a name, a fragment of conversation—anything Lao Feng could use as a lever.

Vann watched as the heavy doors of the main residence opened. He expected a servant, or perhaps a final security sweep. Instead, two small streaks of color—twins, a boy and a girl no more than three years old—erupted from the house. Their high, joyful shouts carried faintly through the mic.

Clarissa didn't just greet them; she dropped her bag and knelt on the wet stone, catching them both in a fierce, enthusiastic embrace.

Vann’s mind raced, frantically flipping through every decrypted file and Triad rumor he had ever memorized. *Children.* There was nothing in the Iron Fang dossiers about heirs. No birth certificates in the Singapore registries, no sightings at the SLAM medical centers. In the eyes of the world, Clarissa Tang was the ""White Widow,"" a solitary figure bound to a husband who lived thirty-six thousand kilometers above the dirt.

Then a man stepped out from the warm amber light of the foyer. He wasn't Georges Reid. He was younger, Asian, dressed in a simple linen shirt. He walked toward Clarissa with a familiar, easy grace, reaching down to help her up before kissing her with a quiet, domestic intimacy.

Vann felt a chill that had nothing to do with the Singapore rain. He wasn't looking at a simple affair; he was looking at the ultimate logistical redirection. The ""Empire"" was a shield. The marriage to the God-Emperor was a front, a hollow shell designed to protect this—a real life, a real family, hidden in the very heart of the storm.

Vann pulled back from the rig, his hands trembling. He realized with a terrifying clarity that he hadn't found leverage for Lao Feng. He had found a secret so dangerous that the mere act of witnessing it had effectively marked him for erasure.

His fingers worked the shutter with a clinical, frantic rhythm, capturing the frames that would burn the world down: the man’s profile, the children’s laughter, the Empress’s unguarded smile. He didn't upload to the cloud—S.L.A.M. owned the sky, and anything transmitted would be intercepted before it reached the first relay. Instead, he pulled the physical encrypted cards, tucking into a lead-lined pouch sewn into his belt.

He didn't return to the van. The van was a beacon, a fixed point in a city governed by predictive algorithms. He ghosted down the back of the ridge, abandoning the heavy rig in a drainage culvert and sliding into the humid, evening shadows of Bukit Timah Road.

Vann didn't hail an auto-cab. He walked until his lungs burned, merging into the anonymity of a crowded bus stop. He caught the 170, the rhythmic hiss of the air-brakes sounding like a countdown. He watched the reflections in the window, scanning every face, every black sedan that lingered a second too long in the neighboring lane.

At Little India, he hopped off before the doors fully closed, cutting through the spice-scented maze of the Tekka Centre to catch a cross-town line heading toward Geylang. He switched three times—bus to MRT, MRT to a different bus—utilizing the chaotic density of the evening rush to bleach his trail. Every time he stepped onto a new platform, he felt the weight of the data against his hip, a radioactive secret that made the neon lights of the city feel like a thousand searching eyes.

By the time he reached the outskirts of his cheap hotel, his shirt was plastered to his back with cold sweat. He didn't use the elevator. He took the service stairs, his hand never leaving the knife at his waist.

At the fourth-floor landing, he paused, back flat against the concrete wall, listening to the hum of the vending machine and the distant mumble of a television. He moved to Room 412. He didn't reach for the handle. He knelt, his eyes inches from the doorframe. The single, grey hair he had wedged into the hinge was still there—undisturbed, a microscopic line of defense.

Inside, he stayed in the shadows, letting the door click shut with a soft, mechanical finality. He didn't reach for the light. Instead, he pulled a small, air-gapped tablet from a hollowed-out floorboard. He reviewed the loop from the pinhole camera he’d hidden in the fire extinguisher across the hall. He scrolled through hours of grainy, low-light footage: a cleaning droid, a couple of tourists, the flickering fluorescent light. No intruders. No ""polite men in suits"" with Phoenix pins.

The paranoia was a physical weight, a constant tension in his jaw. To go against S.L.A.M. was to go against a God that monitored the very pulse of the planet. Every digital footprint was a breadcrumb; every wireless signal was a flare.

He sat at the small, scarred wooden desk. He ignored his laptop. Instead, he pulled a heavy, leather-bound notebook and a fountain pen from his pack. Analog. Old world. No metadata, no IP logs, no ghost in the machine to betray him. The scratching of the nib was the only sound in the room as he began to transcribe the impossible.

*Subject: The Empress’s Garden. Findings: The ""White Widow"" is a logistical fabrication. Heirs confirmed. Secondary subject identified: Non-Imperial male, Asian, domestic partner. The Emperor's official life is a diversion—a global-scale protection detail.*

He stared at the ink as it dried, black and permanent. He was holding the match that could ignite a war, and in the silence of the room, he realized that for the first time in his career, he was truly afraid of the dark.

Vann knew the digital archives were a minefield. S.L.A.M. didn't just delete history; they rewrote it in real-time. If he wanted the truth, he needed the fragments they'd missed—the physical leftovers and the un-scrubbed memories of a city that had been bought and sold a dozen times over.

He left the hotel before dawn, heading for the National Library’s basement—not the sleek, digitized upper floors, but the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. He spent six hours in the dust-choked microfilm stacks, his eyes burning from the flicker of the old projectors. He was looking for the night of the ""Azure Dragon"" collapse, the moment the power shifted from the street to the Spire.

He found it in a scanned copy of an old Mount Elizabeth Hospital psychiatric ward intake form, buried in a defunct medical database. A witness statement: Maria Santos. A domestic helper who had seen the world break inside the Bukit Timah house.

*“The young masters... they leave us... Jian, betrayer ?”*

The words were a hammer blow. Vann cross-referenced the name ""Jian"" with old syndicate personnel files he’d been given. He found a match in a high-res photo of a Azure Dragon low-level enforcer who had vanished the same week Georges Reid married Clarissa Tang. The facial architecture was a ninety-eight percent match for the man he’d seen through the rig at the Garden.

He dug deeper, shifting to the ""Shadow Ledger"" audit reports from the early 204X period. He found the redacted Clause 14-B of the SPBG loan. The default condition: the transfer of Clarissa Tang to the Azure Dragon as ""collateral.""

Vann sat back, the cool air of the library basement feeling like ice on his skin. He understood the math now. The God-Emperor hadn't just saved the bank; he had purchased the freedom of the woman he loved—or perhaps the woman he respected enough to give everything back to. He had liquidated a triad, erased a debt, and provided a global-scale alibi so Clarissa could live in the shadows with her real partner, while he became the ""Silence in the Heavens.""

The twins weren't just heirs; they were the biological proof of a massive, multi-billion credit deception. Every piece of S.L.A.M. propaganda, every ""White Widow"" mourning gown, every speech about the ""divine isolation"" of the Emperor was a security layer for a family that officially didn't exist.

Vann closed the notebook. He had the proof. He had the names. He had the man. But as he looked at the exit, he realized that this information didn't make him a kingmaker for Lao Feng. It made him a loose thread in a tapestry woven by a mind that could calculate the flight path of a B-21 or the collapse of a carrier fleet while eating a pastry.

He wasn't an investigator anymore. He was a witness to a god's personal secret, and in Singapore, the penalty for that was rarely a trial. It was simply the lack of memory of you after being deleted.

He had forgotten the clerk. The man in the library basement was a ghost of a different kind—a paper-pusher whose only loyalty was to the system's log-in screen. After Vann stepped into the oppressive humidity of the street, the clerk’s fingers danced across a keyboard, logging the request into a centralized security index as he had done every day for twenty years. *Subject: Azure Dragon. Case File: OP-DRAGON-FALL.* In a city where the S.L.A.M. grid parsed every byte of data, Vann’s analog curiosity had just left a digital scar.

Back in Room 412, the air was stale. Vann moved with a mechanical, frantic rhythm. Check the hair. Check the loop. Scan for the hidden pulse of a sleeper bug. He sat at the desk, hardening the report with the final, damning details—Jian, the dates, the connection to the Celestial Way. Every word felt like a death warrant.

He didn't sleep. He sat in the dark, watching the red eye of the fire alarm, listening for the sound of an elevator that didn't stop at the fourth floor. At 04:00, he opened a burner browser and booked a one-way flight to Shanghai using a dead man’s credit line. He had to be off the island before the cleaners realized the leak wasn't just digital. He was a loose variable in an empire that didn't tolerate math errors.

Changi Airport was a sprawling cathedral of glass and steel, every biometric sensor and automated gate feeling like a cold, electronic snare. Vann moved through the terminal with the blank, invisible stare of a man who didn't exist, his heart a rhythmic hammer against his ribs. He didn't relax when he cleared the final security gate. He didn't relax as he scanned the crowd for the tell-tale stillness of a tail.

He only felt the first, thin tremor of relief when he stepped into the jet bridge for the 06:15 to Shanghai. The climate-controlled tunnel was a vacuum, a physical transition zone between the city that wanted him erased and the aircraft that would carry him into the chaos of the mainland.

A young woman walked a few paces ahead of him—beautiful, elegantly dressed in a light trench coat, her blonde hair catching the overhead fluorescents. She moved with a slight, graceful hurry. Ten feet from the aircraft door, she stumbled. Her leather shoulder bag slipped, hitting the carpeted floor and spilling a chaotic collection of travel documents and personal items.

It was the vestigial reflex of a life lived before the Empire—a final, fatal lapse into chivalry. Vann stepped forward, bending down gallantly to retrieve a fallen passport.

The woman didn't thank him. She didn't even turn around.

As Vann reached for the document, he felt it—a sharp, clinical sting at the base of his skull, just beneath the hairline. It was the precise, cold puncture of a pressurized injector.

His vision didn't blur; it simply extinguished. The last thing he felt wasn't the carpet or the bag, but the sudden, heavy silence of the void. In the heart of the empire, the variable had finally been reconciled.

A few nights later, in the sprawling, gilded estate of the Lao family in Shanghai, the silence of the pre-dawn hours was broken by a thin, rhythmic sound.

It was the crying of a newborn. A soft, wet whimpering that drifted through the heavy silk curtains of the nursery.

The daughter of Lao Feng stirred in her sleep, the maternal instinct cutting through the fog of exhaustion. She rose, her silk nightgown whispering against the mahogany floorboards, and moved toward the crib. The air in the room felt unnaturally cold, heavy with a metallic, copper scent that made the back of her throat itch.

""Hush now,"" she whispered, her voice thick with sleep. ""Mama is here.""

She reached into the crib, her hand searching for the warmth of her child beneath the hand-embroidered covers. Her fingers touched something cold. Something hard. It wasn't the soft yielding of a baby’s cheek, but the rigid, waxy texture of frozen skin.

The crying stopped instantly, as if a switch had been flipped.

With a sudden, sickening jolt of adrenaline, she threw back the coverlet.

She didn't scream. Not at first. The horror was too total for sound.

Staring up from the center of the white silk mattress was a human head. The skin had been drained to the color of bone, the lips pulled back in a final, silent snarl of terror. The eyes were wide, pinned open with surgical precision, the glassy pupils fixed on the ceiling.

Beneath the severed neck, the crib was a lake of thick, congealing darkness. The baby's white lace gown was saturated, the fabric heavy and sodden with blood that had been poured into the small space like a ritual offering. The infant lay silent, its small body partially obscured by the weight of the man's head, its face smeared with the same dark, iron-scented ruin.

Then the shriek came—a jagged, animal sound that tore through the Lao estate, shattering the silence of the Shanghai night.



**The Underworld: Night in the Pearl of the Orient**

The air in The Gilded Paradox was thick enough to chew—a toxic cocktail of high-end cigar smoke, expensive French cognac, and the lingering scent of sex. Deep in the bowels of the Shanghai Bund, far beneath the soaring maglev tracks and the glowing holos of the S.L.A.M. energy grid, the old world was still breathing, heavy and ragged.

In the VIP sanctum, the walls were lined with silk the color of dried blood. Three men sat in a semicircle of leather armchairs, their faces half-shrouded in the dim, amber glow of a single recessed lantern.

To the left sat Lao Feng, the ""Great Ghost"" of the Iron Fang Triad. He was a man made of scars and expensive linen, representing the mainland's unrefined muscle. Opposite him was Hsieh ""The Serpent"" Kai, a slim, tailored figure from Taipei’s Celestial Way Syndicate, his fingers idly tracing the rim of a crystal glass. Between them sat Oyabun Kenjiro Sato, a man who carried the weight of the Kuro-ryu Clan like a burial shroud, his eyes like polished obsidian.

Lao Feng didn't look at his guests. He looked at the three girls kneeling by the low teak table, their bodies painted in shimmering gold leaf, pouring tea with trembling hands. With a single, sharp flick of his wrist—a gesture that had sent men to their deaths for thirty years—he signaled the room.

The girls retreated instantly, disappearing through the heavy velvet curtains. The personal servant, a man who looked like he’d been built from granite, bowed once and pulled the heavy soundproof doors shut. The silence that followed was heavy, punctuated only by the distant, rhythmic thrum of the city's heartbeat.

Lao Feng leaned forward, the shadows dancing in the hollows of his cheeks. ""The billionaires in the sky are celebrating their new credits,"" he rasped, his voice sounding like sandpaper on stone. ""They think they’ve privatized the stars. But they’ve forgotten one thing.""

Oyabun Sato reached into his kimono, producing a small, obsidian-black datapad. ""They have forgotten that every empire has a gutter,"" he whispered. ""And we are the ones who own the gutter.""

Sato leaned into the light, a cold, predatory gleam in his eyes. ""The Kuro-ryu are ready for the first harvest. The pipes are primed. Our associates at Varga-Nordic—those ice-cold professionals at V.N.B.—did exactly what they were paid for. They tucked a ghost-lab right into the guts of the Heisenberg plan. We’re going to be cooking our own brand of 'medicine' within thirty days. Out there in the void, where gravity doesn't exist to mess with the molecules, the purity is so high it’ll make your soul ache. It’s through the roof.""

He took a slow, deliberate sip of his tea. ""And the best part? The transit. Every container heading back to the mud is going to be handled transparently—ghosts in the machine. Thanks to Reid’s big shiny elevator, the price per container is a rounding error on a dead man’s tab. We aren't just selling a product anymore; we're selling the only thing the Emperor can't tax.""

Hsieh Kai smiled, a thin, predatory expression. ""The Emperor built a shining ladder to the stars. He forgot that the brighter he burns, the deeper the shadows grow—and the shadows are our home.""

Hsieh swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching the light fracture against the crystal. ""Singapore is a dead-end,"" he said, his voice as thin and sharp as a switchblade. ""Out of the Lion City, we can’t touch those automated S.L.A.M. freighters. A pity, too—they’re fast as a bullet and twice as quiet. We tried testing the waters with three dummy shipments. They didn't just go missing; they were deleted. No physical trace, and the S.L.A.M. central server says they never existed in the first place. It’s like trying to smuggle past a god—he doesn’t just take your cargo; he takes the memory of it.""

He leaned in, the shadows pooling in his eyes. ""The last bagman we sent to find the leak? They found him in a Geylang dive, drugged into tomorrow and tangled up with an underage ghost who evaporated the second the door was kicked in. He’s awaiting a date with a firing squad for a crime that was never on paper. So, we do it the hard way. The long walk. New maglev to Thailand, slow-boat to Canada, then a crawl across the border into the States. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and it's ugly. HE seems aware, but do not give a shit.""

Lao Feng grunted, a sound like gravel turning in a cement mixer. ""After Hsieh’s little ghost story, we thought we’d get cute. We went looking for a handle on Clarissa Tang. We reached out to that *lǎo bù sǐ*—the old bastard running the Azure Dragon in Hong Kong. You know what he gave us? A laugh that sounded like a death rattle and a dial tone. That was the end of the conversation.""

He paused, his eyes narrowing into slits. ""I sent a professional. A P.I. with a clean record and a dirty mind. He dug. He found something, alright. But he didn’t make the hand-off. My daughter found his head tucked under the covers in my grandson’s bedroom, staring at the ceiling with wide, dead eyes. That was the message. Loud and clear.""

He leaned back, the leather of his chair creaking like a hanging rope. ""From now on, we don’t walk near the Reid family. We don’t even look at their shadow. As Hsieh said, the Emperor knows we’re here, and he doesn’t care as long as we stay in the mud. But I’ll tell you this—I’m waiting for the day a polite little man in a suit with a Phoenix pin on his lapel comes knocking, asking for a 'contribution.'""

The air in the room got ten degrees colder. All three men felt the horror of potential extortion, something they had all some experience in.

The tension didn't break; it just curdled into a different kind of hunger. At a grunt from Lao Feng, the soundproof doors hissed open and the night truly began. Platters of raw, marbled beef and crystal bowls of synthetic stimulants appeared as if summoned from the ether. The gold-leafed girls returned, moving with the silent, practiced grace of clockwork dolls.

For the next two hours, the ""Gilded Paradox"" lived up to its name. The three masters of the gutter indulged in the spoils of their shadowy domain—expensive cognac flowed like water, and the air turned blue with the smoke of cigars that cost more than a common laborer made in a year. They took what and who they wanted, when they wanted, a desperate display of power in a world where they were increasingly becoming relics.

Finally, as the first grey light of a Shanghai dawn began to bleed through the Bund, the men filtered out. Lao Feng left with his Granite-built shadow; Sato and Kai vanished into the neon rain of the street, their security details materializing from the alleys like ghosts.

The room was left in a state of expensive ruin—tipped glasses, scattered ash, and the lingering scent of spent adrenaline. A team of faceless cleaners moved in, their movements efficient and robotic. They scrubbed the silk, polished the teak, and erased the physical memory of the night’s debauchery in under twenty minutes.

One of the gold-painted girls remained after the others had vanished. She checked the seal on the heavy doors, then walked to a far corner of the room where the wall seemed empty. There, partially hidden by the shifting ambers of the recessed lanterns, was a delicate, ink-wash painting of a dragon coiling through storm clouds.

The girl lowered her head, her posture shifting from that of a servant to one of profound, religious devotion. She bowed deeply toward the dragon.

“Long live the Empire. Long live the Emperor,” she whispered into the silence.

High above the clouds, the small red eye of the dragon in the painting pulsed three times in rhythmic, silent acknowledgment.

Don’t be drawn in by the location or the idea of their market—it’s not worth the cost for a small business. Their markets see little to no foot traffic anymore, and there’s very little support for the vendors. He will tell you they will advertise and market their weekly Saturday market, but a middle school basketball team puts together a better marketing plan then their family. The focus seems to be on their coffee operation, which, frankly, is average at best.

This location has become a revolving door for small food businesses, and it’s honestly sad to see. While I understand it’s not Franks responsibility to run your business for you, the rent makes it extremely difficult to stay afloat especially when margins are already tight.

There are better options out there if you’re trying to break in. Consider reaching out to local churches, fire halls, or community spaces that may rent kitchen or event space at a much more affordable rate. Every dollar matters when you’re starting out, and paying high rent for little return isn’t going to help you succeed.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

1pwprqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1pwprqf/coffee_smell_with_no_coffee/,Coffee smell with no coffee,"Tonight something interesting happened. We are visiting my aunt for Christmas and a 12 of us were playing a trivia game in her living room. We were laughing and having a great time and then very randomly 3 of us smelled a very strong, very potent smell of freshly brewed coffee at the same time. It was like the coffee was percolating right next to us. My aunt, sister and I smelled it but no one else did. Our husbands, my niece nephew, cousins and my children did not smell it. It was so strong. It lasted about 2 minutes. It was strong enough for me to say, “oooo who’s making coffee because I’ll take some”. the coffee pot was off and empty and we looked around, there were no old coffee cups around. My aunt keeps a clean house so that wasn’t really a possibility. My aunt and I were next to each other but my sister was on the opposite side of the room. We thought maybe my uncle came home with a cup of coffee but he was still out. Anyone experience this? Our mom’s was kind of blown. When we were talking later my aunt said it reminded here of when her granddaddy would come over early to their house when they were still sleeping on Saturdays and she would wake up to the brewing coffee. Just a weird, shared experience but not shared by everyone in the room. Did we experience a smell from a spirit?",5,1766813104.0,Paranormal,6,0.86,False
1pwppks,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pwppks/my_26f_sister_hates_me_24f_and_im_at_a_loss/,My 26F sister hates me (24F) and I’m at a loss,"My sister hates me and I’m at a loss. I know as time goes on and the more we bicker she has more basis or more of a past with me to her angry over. But it has really always been this way. I’m 24 and she is 26, I had a lot of physical and mental health problems as a kid, often in severe pain or discomfort of some sort, and very emotional because I couldn’t understand what was happening to little me. (OCD, cptsd, endo, etc) we both got different kinds of attention but I never thought one more than the other. Just had different needs. 

But as we get older I realize she gets (and always has gotten) angry at me over really small things that don’t affect her whatsoever. Just to give an example, the other day (on vacation) I had a really bad endo flare up, I was in so much pain I was crying. It was after dinner, around 8 pm so I said lemme lay down for a second and chill before getting ready for bed and brushing my teeth etc. I even told her I’m so sorry I’m crying just gimme a sec and I’ll be good!! She immediately starts to question me like “ew you’re not gonna brush your teeth?!” I was so hormonal and emotional and in pain I lashed out at her. I can’t stand the antagonizing questions, and I know she does it because it works and frustrates me. We started yelling at each other. 

It is constantly like this, all the fucking time. She gets upset at what I wear, anything I do, or things I say that aren’t inflammatory whatsoever. I genuinely feel like I can’t do the right thing. Even my parents (who are often similar unfortunately) say she is aggressive towards me, but that I also struggle to control my emotions and I let it get to me. Which is true. But I think once your buttons get pushed so many times you can only take so much. I get called crazy when I get upset at how I’m treated, and told to go with the flow, but again they get upset at me when I do. I know I am not perfect and I often do complain about my pain for example, which I know is annoying. I think I do it because I want them to care. Like, another example here, but today she had a headache and my mom was giving her kisses and hugs, whereas I had never gotten that while I was in any pain. I used to beg for hugs and comfort as a child and I refuse to do it now. 

Again I know all my health problems were not easy for my family, and that they do financially support me in terms of medical stuff and taking us on vacation and such. I’m so grateful for all they do for me and I always tell them but I still feel I don’t deserve to be treated this way. I revert back to my child self with them, and my temper is so unlike me. I’m normally such a calm person and I’m so sad to see myself act in a way that is uncomfortable for me and others. I’m not sure any amount of rationalizing or therapy or willpower is gonna fix our problems with each other, and I’m starting to accept we will never truly be sisters, as I’ve never felt like I had an older sister to trust or talk to or rely on. She’s just there, and so am I. We have no bond except over how fucked our family is towards each other and that we all need therapy. But nobody wants to change. When I had lashed out, my dad had a conversation with me hours later about how I need to let things be and laugh at the situation and to change my behavior but I do care and I don’t think it’s fair that I’ve worked so hard through years of therapy to change and to understand why things are the way they are. Why do I have to change but nobody else does? Why am I the only one here who’s a problem? Again I know I am not a perfect person and I have been an annoying daughter in the past but I can’t help but feel like, am I really so horrible that I deserve to be treated like this? 

I started developing ocd obsessions about whether or not I am a good person over very very small things or incidents, even as a small as just spilling my coffee. I believe my family thinks I want to be a victim and that I choose to be one, and I know it’s a choice to react but I didn’t choose to be antagonized and belittled and yelled at over minute things 🥲 truly at a loss and so curious if others relate, and what they’ve done.

TLDR: my sister hates me and anything I do or say, no amount of trying has made a difference in our relationship, what to do?",1,1766812913.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1pwpos3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/1pwpos3/thank_you_merry_christmas_santa_is_real_and_heres/,[Thank You] Merry Christmas! Santa is real and here's the proof!,"This group of Santas know how to go all out for children on Christmas! 

ALL DAY on Christmas Eve, my kids took initiative to get their bedrooms completely clean. As much as they don't seem to believe in the Yule Cat story, they definitely enjoyed laughing about it as their rooms became the tidiest they've been in a year. However, it took almost an hour and a half of me suggesting (not telling) for someone to take out the trash when it got dark. Nicholas and Isabella finally took it out and discovered the annual Christmas Eve delivery from Mrs. Clause. It had the pajamas and blankets from the RAOC contests, along with some reindeer food, a gingerbread house kit (that we didn't have time for), and a small Christmas tree. 

They took baths in record time and set up the Christmas tree. *I told them that they needed to be in bed by 8 PM and it was 8:30 PM before baths started. They didn't get to bed until at least 10 PM.* Me and my husband were outside for a while seeing our next door neighbors off. We've lived next to each other for just over 6 years now and Christmas Eve was their final trip with the moving truck. Right at midnight, one of the neighbors (I still don't know who) launched fireworks for a good 5-10 minutes. I was busy referencing screenshots (that I was smart enough to take this year) to sort out the stocking stuffers into the correct stickongs. I need u/0hn35 Tetris Magic to pack everything into the car for our next trip. My kids are giving me mixed messages about whether they heard it or not. My husband definitely slept through it and Jacob definitely did not. He was awake screaming and crying until 3 AM, which is why I'm posting my Thank You post Christmas and not on Christmas day. 

I still love the wrapping paper from u/Soillure. I felt like I was working in Santa's Workshop every time I handled it. The left over paper from last year fell off the shelf of my closet as the first package arrived. It was clearly a sign that it was meant to be used again. The quality of this paper is amazing and I feel like the string elevates the apperance. One day, I shall buy it in bulk and start a gift wrapping service. I did have to resort to some store bought paper for some of the larger gifts though. And I still ran out of time/skill to wrap a few. 
[The wrapping](https://imgur.com/a/1UKuzWe) Sorry, I missed the photos of a few things getting wrapped. Attempting to disappear for 15-30 minutes at a time is virtually impossible with 7 kids who are always in the house.

[The arrival of the gifts](https://imgur.com/a/OMZUr3x) is like Christmas to me. All these packages started showing up and I told the kids that some of the elves are pulling a prank by sending empty Amazon boxes. Most of the toys come in oversized boxes with a lot of packing paper. I'm usually able to quickly consolidate multiple boxes into one big one at the bottom of a pile and leave the empty boxes on top. After checking a few boxes on top, I can get the kids to go away which buys me some time to hide the better. As a box would get full of wrapped gifts, I gave it to my husband to move to the garage of a vacant house that he's been working on. Hiding gifts for 7 kids is much more intense than it was when I only had to hide them for 2-3 toddlers.

We have a family tradition that's been passed down for a few generations. Everyone watches someone open their gift. The person who just opened a gift picks out a gift a gift for anyone other than themselves. Then, it continues until there's no more gifts. The only thing we've changed is that we open the toys as they get unwrapped so it's not as stressful waiting until the end. 

Here they are, [opening the gifts](https://imgur.com/a/w5qwuQA). And here's [part 2](https://imgur.com/a/R4MdwKb).  

They started off with the the pajamas and blankets, courtesy of u/0hn35, u/ginger_newt, and u/Songlcy4058. Lol. Poor Isabella is so tiny that she was swimming in her pajamas. Joseph believes that his pajamas were custom made for him because he's never seen Cat Noir pajamas before. 

I love the stockings that I received from u/wishyouamerry a couple of years ago. They're big enough to accommodate u/0hn35 stocking stuffers. Even though I went through the trouble of sorting out the stocking stuffers, it seemed like a lot of it just got mixed in together. This year, I ran out of wrapping time so they got the board games from u/Songlcy4058, marbles and cards from u/AceReverie, behind the stockings as family gifts. I think the kids instinctively knew to hold off on opening those for a couple of days until the chaos settles down. I'll need to get some cases ready for when the boxes inevitably fall apart. *P.S. I don't where Twister came from. It just showed up on my car one day.* I'm looking forward to using the nail stamping kits, but I'm waiting for my fingers to heal up a little bit first. I have a cut on my thumb and several little paper cuts (from cardboard and plastics) around some of my finger nails.

u/SantessaClaus, Andrew's Monster School bus was tough to wrap, but I believe that it will last a very long time. He has a fascination with school buses and likes to wait outside as school busses pass by after school. He already has his monster school bus picking up imaginary people to go on dangerous rides. 

u/Songlcy4058, thank you for the Legos for Nicholas. Legos get lost so easily and classic Lego s come with the best Lego storage container. 

u/pinksocks867, Anastasia used the pom-pom makes to make emergency pom-pom balls for her cousins. She was worried about going over to their house on Christmas with no gifts. She loves to give gifts anytime she can. Also, I'm sure she would love your name. When she wrote her letter to Santa this year, she asked for 300 pairs of socks... apparently you dont need socks in the summer since you wear sandals. 

u/mik8c, I'm going out tomorrow to replace our box fan (my husband ""borrowed"" ours to use for ventilation for a construction site) for the arctic dome for Alexander. Joseph is loving his 3D printed dragon. We went over to my sister's house and I was confused when I saw him playing with a different one. I was trying to figure out why it looked like it changed colors when I found out that my niece has an identical one already. Isabella hasn't rolled out her yoga mat yet (there hasn't been enough floor space yet), but she's carrying it around with the strap that came with it. I'll post pictures once she gets to use it. Jacob is going crazy for the dancing Cactus. At first he was scared of it, but ever since he first held it, it makes him laugh the cutest laugh which of course make the cactus laugh, which makes him laugh harder.

u/OpportunitySmooth, Anastasia hasn't made a bracelet yet because she has too many plans for them. She will though. It's one of her favorite things to do. Isabella melted when she saw Tinkerbell. She wanted the box opened immediately so she could check if her shoes really have pom-poms on them. She made me take several pictures showing her from every angle and showed me that she has a brush too. 

u/SteveBoaman, Alexander opened his metal detector long before Nicholas opened his. Nicholas made sure Alexander knew how to use it, while Alexander measured gifts by the number of (puppy themed) bones indicated on the screen. Once he opened his metal detector, he left Alexander alone and focused on his own. He said that he wants to go online and find the special battery for it. I explained that 9V batteries are common enough to be found almost anywhere. Luckily, Grandpa had one for him. The drone. The drone was a major winner for him. This is the first time in 4 years that he has not asked for a drone. He was soo excited when he saw it. He received a letter from Santa's Workshop telling him that he would receive one. During our break, Anastasia was the one who was eager to get started again because she wanted to see Nicholas open his drone. He has used it nonstop. When the battery is charging, he's sending the recorded footage to Grandma.

u/soillure, before Anastasia finished unwrapping Red from the newest Descendants movie, both Anastasia and Isabella were breaking out into a song from the movie. They share a bed and often fall asleep at night watching either Red or Kpop Demon Hunters. I feel like she wants to be too cool for dolls, but also still wants every doll she can play with. About 3-4 years ago, I built her a giant dollhouse, but she seems to be using it more and more as a bookshelf.

u/Santamakesitrain, you got almost everything on Andrew's list. He always takes really good care of his toys. This year, a few ended up broken (most likely at the hands or lack of body awareness of one of his older brothers), but he was determined to keep them. As soon as he opened them, he was running them down the hall to place on ""his"" shelf or up on his bed. *He's in the top bunk and toys are generally safe there.* He's going to make sure they all get played with every day and is kept safe. I think he believes the toys have feelings. The big firetruck is the mom to all the little Firetrucks and it's funny watching him put them to sleep at night. The farm truck is being used as a bus for all of his other vehicles. He drops off the tractors at work and drives all the other cars to the mechanic, then he goes to pick up the working tractors so they can go back home. He also has some sort of fascination with small flashlights and magnifying glasses, so the outdoor kit is getting a lot of indoor love. He's having trouble adjusting the binoculars. 

u/Lonestarpenguin, Nicholas is already putting together his little robots and taking them apart. The instructions say that it's for ages 8-12 and that each one should take 30-60 minutes to assemble, but he had them all put together in about 15 minutes. The little robots are so cute. They reminds me of the circuitry kits that I used to put together as a kid. He already has ideas on how to make them more elaborate, so I'm curious to see what happens. He's also launching paper airplanes down the hall and testing what angles can make them go further or faster. It's amazing what can happen with just paper, cardboard and a few rubberbands.

u/PM_YOUR__BUBBLE_BUTT, Joseph knew that the soccer ball was his. He recognized it immediately as team Barcelona, aka Barca. The next game between Barcelona and Real Madrid should be really interesting. Should he side with his cousin, like he usually does, and cheer for Teal Madrid, or should he side with Daddy (and clearly Santa) and cheer for Barcelona. *I didn't see a ball for Real Madrid to give him a fair chance.* He's also excited for the ""Spiderman"" piggy bank. He's been collecting change and now he has somewhere to put it. He says he's going to follow the savings chart to save up $5 at a time. *He's going to put in cents instead of dollars.* Isabella is excited about her unicorn cars. She knows she wont have to try to fight for cars if they're pink... it's like having her name written right on them.

u/SshellsBbells, Anastasia is covered in paint now... I hope these paint markers wash out of clothes. While everyone was opening gifts, she was hanging out with the pens and markers filling the blank notebook that came in her stocking. I wanted to take pictures of her artwork, but she's not ready to show it off yet. I'm working on getting her into an anime art class soon (probably after Cookie Season). If I had thought about it, I would have wrapped the bead board with the beads or tucked it a little further behind the tree to be opened later. It was a huge clue that beads were coming. She is trying to decide what to use the cash box for when Cookie Season is over. She knows that her art supplies need to stay locked up when she's not using it and she knows that I keep my medicine in the tiny lock box from last year. It took her a while to decide that she will use it as her own piggy bank. 

u/kattehryde, I figured Nicholas would use the blacklight flashlights to have glowing dance parties. As soon as he opened them up, he informed me that scorpions and certain bugs will glow under them. This was news to me. Fortunately, there are no scorpions around here. He is having fun ""charging"" everything that glows in the dark with them though. As soon as Anastasia opened the storage containers, she yelled, ""Oh my gosh! I can organize stuff now!"" She took off to grab her art bin and started sorting all of her pens, markers, and Art supplies into the little containers. Seriously, I thought she would just use them to sort out some beads and separate different crafts projects. I never knew that organization would mean anything to her since her version of cleaning is to just stuff everything into a bag and shove it under her pillow. Alexander loves everything about How Wheels. This year, he wanted the big dragon one and the one that eats cars. Every time he got to unwrap something he was saying, ""this is going to be the one the eat or shoots Hot Wheels! I know it! I can feel it in my bones."" Joseph has been telling everyone for weeks that he was getting Hulk Gloves for Christmas. He saw them in Walmart's toy guide this year. It's funny watching him act like hulk. They love dressing up as super heroes. Andrew wont let anyone touch the wooden cars or the buildings that came with them. He has a rug with a street map on it. He's placing the buildings on their respective spots on the map. When somebody lays out a rug or small blanket, it's generally a play zone for one person. It's just one of the ways to set some boundaries in our tiny house with so many people. We're still trying to figure out how to get the pop it games to synchronize to each other. They work individually and are kind of like a memory game. I think all the boys are enjoying the bath toys.

u/tjcline09, Jacob likes holding the rolling puppy toy. He keeps trying to put the tail in his mouth... he's still working on how to interact with it. Isabella's going to make sure he knows everything about before the new year comes. He's having a blast with the balance bike. It's the perfect size for him. He's also pushing the bulldozer around like a vacuum cleaner. Lol. He doesn't seem to understand yet that the balls are a part of the toy. Alexander is thrilled to have a car that eats the Hot Wheels and one that launches them. When Alexander opened the metal detector, he started using it to check everything. He was checking to see if anyone was a robot. He was using it to try to influence which gift gets picked next. He wants to year up the hardwood floors to salvage scrap metal. *We're mean people who are not going to allow that.* During our break, they went outside and used it to find 2 Hot Wheels and a penny. One car was barely burried and the other one was about 4 inches under ground. Joseph has been having too much fun with the voice changer megaphone. I loved watching him scare one of his cousins with the ""monster"" voice.  First of all, it's extremely loud. I celebrate internally when it dies. Then, I'm reminded that it's rechargeable. Gone are the days of making then wait for the next trip to the store for new batteries. He likes the watch, too. It has more features than I thought it would. One of the features is a camera. After realizing that, he quickly decide to put the watch strap away and use the lanyard for it. The walkie talkies never showed up. I'll let you know as soon as they don't though. Isabella fits inside the little wagon. I thought it would be the perfect size for a doll or a stuffie, but no, it can tote her whole army of dolls around. As soon as it came out of the box, she climbed in and insisted that Joseph pull her around. We're predicting that she's going to be a very short adult. OMG! She LOVES the bubble wand. That's one that breaks my heart when the battery dies. It's also rechargeable, but she doesn't quite understand why we can't just buy a new battery to replace it. I officially bought a fan today to set up the aero domes. I'll update the picture after we get to set it up. 

We had at least one secret Santa. One sent the Nerf Minecraft Axe and the Minecraft Spyglass. I didn't realize that it was Nerf. He's pretending it's a costume axe. *Nerf bullets don't last long around here. Alexander is a sensory seeker and tends to chew on them.* We also just found out last week that his vision has significantly deteriorated since this time last year so aiming is difficult for him. He love how the spyglass makes everything look pixelated. One of his favorite books is about a Minecraft character who comes through the computer into the real world. Another Santa, or possibly the same one, sent a talking toddler chair and a toddler coffee machine. It turns out, he doesn't appreciate coffee (yet!), but he does like the noise it makes. I think this whole Christmas was way too overwhelming for him, especially since he thought the whole World should know that he was still awake at 3 AM. The chair is cute. He keeps sitting down on it to play with the buttons, then stands up to check under the seat, then repeats. 

And finally, each of their [Christmas hauls](https://imgur.com/a/hFLWGz2). I've never used that term before. They enjoyed seeing their new items all together like that. I might try printing those off for them to hold onto. 

This thank you post took all day to type up. I had it most of the way done, then my phone died so I lost it and had to start over again. I really hope I didn't miss anyone. We've had a stressful few weeks and it's been hard to keep track of everything. I'm still trying to read through everything on this group.

1pwpmrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pwpmrl/my_26f_sister_hates_me_24f_and_im_at_a_loss/,My 26F sister hates me (24F) and I’m at a loss,"My sister hates me and I’m at a loss. I know as time goes on and the more we bicker she has more basis or more of a past with me to her angry over. But it has really always been this way. I’m 24 and she is 26, I had a lot of physical and mental health problems as a kid, often in severe pain or discomfort of some sort, and very emotional because I couldn’t understand what was happening to little me. (OCD, cptsd, endo, etc) we both got different kinds of attention but I never thought one more than the other. Just had different needs. But as we get older I realize she gets (and always has gotten) angry at me over really small things that don’t affect her whatsoever. Just to give an example, the other day (on vacation) I had a really bad endo flare up, I was in so much pain I was crying. It was after dinner, around 8 pm so I said lemme lay down for a second and chill before getting ready for bed and brushing my teeth etc. I even told her I’m so sorry I’m crying just gimme a sec and I’ll be good!! She immediately starts to question me like “ew you’re not gonna brush your teeth?!” I was so hormonal and emotional and in pain I lashed out at her. I can’t stand the antagonizing questions, and I know she does it because it works and frustrates me. We started yelling at each other. It is constantly like this, all the fucking time. She gets upset at what I wear, anything I do, or things I say that aren’t inflammatory whatsoever. I genuinely feel like I can’t do the right thing. Even my parents (who are often similar unfortunately) say she is aggressive towards me, but that I also struggle to control my emotions and I let it get to me. Which is true. But I think once your buttons get pushed so many times you can only take so much. I get called crazy when I get upset at how I’m treated, and told to go with the flow, but again they get upset at me when I do. I know I am not perfect and I often do complain about my pain for example, which I know is annoying. I think I do it because I want them to care. Like, another example here, but today she had a headache and my mom was giving her kisses and hugs, whereas I had never gotten that while I was in any pain. I used to beg for hugs and comfort as a child and I refuse to do it now. Again I know all my health problems were not easy for my family, and that they do financially support me in terms of medical stuff and taking us on vacation and such. I’m so grateful for all they do for me and I always tell them but I still feel I don’t deserve to be treated this way. I revert back to my child self with them, and my temper is so unlike me. I’m normally such a calm person and I’m so sad to see myself act in a way that is uncomfortable for me and others. I’m not sure any amount of rationalizing or therapy or willpower is gonna fix our problems with each other, and I’m starting to accept we will never truly be sisters, as I’ve never felt like I had an older sister to trust or talk to or rely on. She’s just there, and so am I. We have no bond except over how fucked our family is towards each other and that we all need therapy. But nobody wants to change. When I had lashed out, my dad had a conversation with me hours later about how I need to let things be and laugh at the situation and to change my behavior but I do care and I don’t think it’s fair that I’ve worked so hard through years of therapy to change and to understand why things are the way they are. Why do I have to change but nobody else does? Why am I the only one here who’s a problem? Again I know I am not a perfect person and I have been an annoying daughter in the past but I can’t help but feel like, am I really so horrible that I deserve to be treated like this? I started developing ocd obsessions about whether or not I am a good person over very very small things or incidents, even as a small as just spilling my coffee. I believe my family thinks I want to be a victim and that I choose to be one, and I know it’s a choice to react but I didn’t choose to be antagonized and belittled and yelled at over minute things 🥲 truly at a loss and so curious if others relate, and what they’ve done.

I’m a woman in my late 20s and just finishing grad school, which means I essentially put dating on ice for several years. Not because I’m mysterious or career-obsessed, but because grad school was already emotionally demanding and I did not have the bandwidth to also process a man who “doesn’t know what he’s looking for.” 

Now I’m graduating, my frontal lobe is online, and I feel… ready? Except the dating apps are truly alarming. Why is everyone “just seeing what’s out there.” Why is every photo a fish, a group of indistinguishable men, or a blurry mirror selfie. Why do I feel like I’m speed-running disappointment. 

So my sincere, mildly spiraling question: where are people actually meeting decent men in real life in their late 20s (specifically, in PGH)? Are we striking up conversations at coffee shops? Dog parks (I do not have a dog)? Friend-of-friend setups? Do I need to develop a personality around rock climbing?

I’m not looking for anything unhinged. Just a kind, emotionally functional adult who can hold a conversation and believes communication is not cringe. Therapy attendance would be a plus. 

Please advise. I am tired and would like to delete Hinge with dignity.",34,1766812154.0,pittsburgh,52,0.76,False

1pwpgc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1pwpgc2/making_34kmonth_from_a_micro_saas_i_built_in_my/,Making $3.4K/month from a micro SaaS I built in my spare time took a year but finally feeling sustainable,"Always wanted to build something on the side that could eventually replace my salary, but my first few attempts were disasters. Built a task management app nobody used, then a Chrome extension that got 30 installs total. Both times I just built what I thought would be cool without checking if anyone actually needed it. Classic mistake but I kept making it anyway.



The idea for my current product came from my day job as a marketing manager. We'd spend hours every month pulling data from different tools, Google Analytics, social media, email platforms, just to create reports for clients. Complained about it during lunch one day and two coworkers immediately agreed it was the worst part of the job. Started asking around at a marketing meetup, found out this was pretty universal, agencies just accept it as part of the process. Most people were either doing it manually or paying for enterprise tools that cost $300+ per month and had way more features than they needed.



Didn't jump straight into building this time though, learned that lesson. Spent maybe 3 weeks just having coffee chats with people at small agencies asking how they handle reporting. Talked to maybe 15 people total, most said they'd be interested in something simpler and cheaper but the ""interested"" responses felt pretty lukewarm honestly. Two people said if I built something under $50/month that just pulled basic metrics from 5-6 main tools, they'd probably try it. Not exactly a ringing endorsement but better than nothing.



Built the first version over 6 weeks, working nights and weekends. Used a boilerplate for all the auth and billing stuff because I'd wasted months building that from scratch before. Just focused on connecting to 5 tools and generating a simple PDF report. Showed it to those two people from my conversations, both said they'd give it a shot. Set it up at $39/month, they both subscribed. First $78 MRR felt pretty good.



Posted about it in some marketing and agency Facebook groups in month two, got maybe 20 signups and 4 more paying customers. Growth was really slow for the first 5-6 months, felt like I was stuck at $400-500 MRR forever. Started writing blog posts about agency reporting and marketing metrics in month 4, mostly out of desperation. First several posts got basically no views, almost gave up on content. But around month 7 one post started ranking and brought steady traffic.



Now 13 months in and at $3.4K MRR with 92 paying customers. Still growing about 8-12% monthly, mostly from SEO and word of mouth from existing customers. Working maybe 6-8 hours per week on it, mostly support emails and small feature tweaks. Not enough to quit my job yet but getting close to where I'd feel comfortable trying.



What made this one work when the others failed was just talking to people who had the problem first, not building in isolation. Also keeping it super focused, I still get feature requests weekly but mostly say no to keep it simple. Those insights came from reading micro SaaS founder stories in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) where everyone said the same thing, simple focused products that solve one problem well beat complicated products that try to do everything. Took me three failures to actually listen to that advice though.",19,1766812090.0,microsaas,4,0.91,False
1pwpfyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1pwpfyb/putting_the_pieces_together/,Putting The Pieces Together,"This is a positive and negative vent!

Dear Anyone,

Get ready this is gonna be juicy! A story and goal setting! \*Rubs hands together\* This will be exciting for me and you!

I’m relaxing for bed, so I’m kinda sleepy, LOL. I don’t know if I can wait to type this. As I want to use this as possible motivation later.

Recently life has just been passing by like wind. Thankfully not too fast, just enough. Which made me realize I should get myself on track.

My life and self issues have been a on and off thing for some years now. However, there was improvement throughout time but it \*was\* just decent enough. Like all things, “this old air” also needs to be let go. To flow with the rest of the breeze. Just as time has. What is this old air? Well..

At the end of 2024 I ran into trouble. This was my 2nd year stepping out of my (social) comfort zone. I was trying to talk to everyone. Regardless if it formed friendships or not. I didn’t care about the age.. …..Wait that makes me sound like a ped\*phile. But no, to clarify: I’m a young adult and those in this story were also. The other ages (mentioned) were also adults, even older ones.

This was at work or in the taxis. Although this wasn’t the worst idea. I realized I may have been too friendly. Especially when you’re a recovering people pleaser. It taught me a lot at least..

Keep in mind I was kind of, I would say sheltered? But it was more inexperience with adult males? I was basically a young adult who didn’t talk to men in high school. So I sheltered myself? Anyway!

I met this guy from another country. He seemed like he wanted a relationship after 2 weeks. Even though I told him I only wanted friendship. He asked if I wanted to buy a bird together and then later on move in. It was creepy, so I blocked him.

Later on after that a random Caucasian boy asked me out at my new workplace. Let’s just say he was rejected, nicely. The next day I said “hello,” to be friendly and he ran away. This made me feel guilty.

So when this other.. you guessed it.. another boy at work asks me out. Well sort of.. He didn’t ask me out, but his intentions were obvious. Because he wasn’t direct, I thought I would give him a chance. Maybe he’s feeling the vibe first.

That’s part one! It’s short because it’s late/very early where I am. I’m not sure if anyone will be invested. But it relates to where I am now and my goals I’m setting.

Some of my Goals:

1. Don’t drink coffee in the mornings (I have good reasons).
2. Hangout with my cat.

You may wonder why this relates to the story above. Let’s just say my mental health went down hill because of it. It ruined some precious things in my life. Thankfully I had antidepressants and awareness of my mental health (sorta) prior to this. Younger me would have struggled. I’m happy to say even though it did go downhill, it was easier to manage.

I yearn for you.


But I'm too afraid of the rejection that will come.


I wanted to message you and ask if you were free tonight, but I know it'd never get the response I want...

The universe has never brought you back into my sights since I left that job... in my mind that means you're not meant to be in my life... You probably don't even remember me now, I was nothing but a random girl you worked with.


But that doesn't mean, I dont desperately hope that when a white Mercedes passes me, that its your one. I've passed you many time, driving aimlessly around town, makes me curious to ask what you were doing. Both times you've come into my new job, I've missed you by chance completely, and I am almost glad I did, I don't know how I would react to seeing you again.

It has been just shy of 6 months since I left that workplace, and I miss seeing you everyday, I got so use to seeing you face, hearing your voice and adorable laugh.. its like it haunts me. 3 years of being around you constantly... then nothing, I mean you weren't even sad so I don't know why I feel this way about you or hope you feel the same.... but...

When I worked with you, side by side, even a brush of your arm would set a shiver down my spine, I could never meet your eyes properly, afraid you'd see my attraction and affection. I hated being in the Cafe with you, we have to work so closely at the coffee machine, I could smell your cologne, feel your breath on my neck sometimes by chance.. I still don't know what your eye colour is Adam...
I truly thought if I stared too deeply into your eyes....
That you would somehow see and feel all my fantasies that came alive when I was alone...

Is this just some lost limerance spiral I'll never get out of..? 

I thought leaving would make me think of you less, but you are all I ever think about. 


We never had that kind of connection though... we weren't friends, we were barely friendly coworkers. I know this is completely one sided, but in my hope that somehow you do feel that same way about me, I will continue to scream into this void on a tiny corner of the internet... knowing you'll never find it, or me.

To; the man who snuck into my mind, please get out, I want you, but you are disturbing the peace I was trying to create..

December 2025 has been *wild* for Genspark AI—fresh off their epic **Genspark Live product launch** on November 20 (with spillover hype into early December), the team dropped five game-changing projects that turn prompts into polished, actionable magic. We're talking less grunt work, more ""WOW"" moments, from autonomous phone calls to multi-model masterpieces.

I've been testing these hands-on (shoutout to the free credits and unlimited AI Chat/Image access through 2026—game-changer!), and they make Genspark feel like your ultimate digital sidekick. Here's the breakdown of the **5 recent Genspark AI projects from December 2025**, straight from the latest buzz. Each one builds on their **Super Agent** core, blending research, creation, and automation into one seamless workspace.

### 1. **Super Agent 2.0 with Mixture of Agents**
Kicked off early December: The upgraded Super Agent now mixes top models like **ChatGPT, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5.2** for every prompt. It ""thinks"" about your request, picks tools, fact-checks across AIs to slash hallucinations, and runs multi-step workflows. Example: Prompt ""Prep me for tomorrow's meetings,"" and it scans your calendar, summarizes contacts, drafts briefs, and even suggests reply times. Perfect for pros juggling chaos—turns vague ideas into structured wins.

### 2. **AI Sheets for Instant Data Mastery**
Mid-December rollout: **AI Sheets** acts like a turbo research analyst. Ask for ""top 20 YouTube vids on AI automation,"" and it pulls views, likes, tags, etc., into live tables. One-click viz? It auto-generates **Python/Jupyter code** for charts and reports. Creators and marketers, this is your new bestie for competitive intel without spreadsheet hell.

### 3. **Call for Me Agent – Real-World Action Hero**
Hot off the December updates: The **""Call for Me"" agent** dials businesses, navigates menus, chats with humans, and delivers transcripts + summaries. Linked to Gmail/Calendar/Drive, it preps meetings or handles errands. Imagine outsourcing that restaurant res—Genspark does it while you sip coffee. Ties perfectly into the Live launch's ""AI-powered phone calls"" promise.

### 4. **Image & Video Studio Overhaul**
Late December firepower: **Image Studio** + video gen powered by **Gemini V2, Luma AI, PixVerse, Flux, Seedream, and Nano Banana Pro**. Prompt-to-visuals or image-to-video, with auto-model selection for top quality. Unlimited access means endless experimentation—no credit caps eating your budget. Devs are raving about embedding this into apps for dynamic sites.

### 5. **Deep Research Chains to Shareable Outputs**
Wrapping the month: Enhanced **multi-agent task chains** for end-to-end flows, like ""Research competitors → build slides → analyze data."" Genspark scans sites, pulls pricing/reviews, and spits out reports, decks, or dashboards. Founders love it for product validation; coders use it for debugging/architecture. Replaces juggling ChatGPT tabs—unified workspace FTW.

These aren't hype; they're battle-tested for turning learning into earnings. I prototyped a mini AI course in under an hour using Super Agent + Slides—packaged it as a workshop checklist and freelanced it out. Genspark shines because it's *adaptable*: quick explainers to full projects, always verifying outputs to dodge AI pitfalls.

What do you think, Genspark squad? Which project's your fave? Drop your workflows in the comments—have you built anything insane with unlimited models? Let's showcase! 🔥 #GensparkAI #AISuperAgent #DecemberDrops

1pwp583,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1pwp583/my_issues_with_newest_episodes/,My issues with newest episodes,"Don't get me wrong overall I still like it.  But have grown attached to the characters so would probably watch them just sit around and drink coffee and talk. Or better watch them play a dnd game.

But did have a few issues I just wanted to vent out and get out of my head.

First the cave.  I had a feeling it would be a past trauma that kept him out but really wanted something more.  This isnt some character with a good life and one traumatic thing they are avoiding.  This is someone with a traumatic life.  Government testing. Being flayed.  Plus add in all the stuff hes done like breaking and killing four kids. Everything he sees the demos do.  And I just dont see how trauma. Even his first. Is going to prevent him from getting the last kid and his plan failing.  In fact he seems to feed off the trauma.

Next issue with the cave.  All memories seem to be connected through doors or passages. Except this one luckily is fused fully with his made up mindscape of a town?

Related to cave. What if maxs speech about hero holly hadn't worked.  Holly would have gone back to cave maybe with or without max and they would have stayed there and his plan would never have moved forward because of this one trauma he had?

Before these episodes I thought it might be the mindflayers independent will and power in the cave.  So it was the mindflayer forcing the connection.  Henry keeping it to the side but unable to expel it.  And his fear was getting flayed again and risking losing his mind more to the mindflayer.  Or something stranger or more unique then past trauma.

Next issue the ending.  Why did they attack the military base?  Why not move a plate and go in.  If saving els powers could dig in or use a vehicle to help dig or move a plate.  Assuming no tunnel interacted with any of the four rift paths.  Which seems unlikely but true.

They risked being shot, I know plot armor is strong.  One spike strip could have messed with the truck.  They didnt know how many troops or what was currently on the otherside of the rift.  Also while the truck could barrel through a chain link gate. Why would the military have remote receivers attached to their gates.  Theres a reason people are always standing by the gates.  They know the military wants el, so her showing herself and alerting the military just means all they have should now be chasing them.  This seems like unneeded risk. How easy would it be to shoot someone as they climb the tower.  What if one guard manages to stop the bomb at the exotic matter?  Other then Nancy looking badass I just don't see the need for all the risk and exposure. 

Lastly the future ending.  So exposure to the mindflayer changes your blood type.  8 is trying to convince 11 to let it end with them.  But what about will. What about the 12 kids?  They've had exposure now.  The military knows at least some of the kids taken if not all 12.  If theyre returned for a happy ending what prevents them from being used?  Related, havent seen the play but why was Henry the only kid ever sent to that dimension?  I know that part was unintended.  But what prevented Brenner from sending others? 

Thanks for reading. Sharing helps get it out of the head.",5,1766811165.0,StrangerThings,6,0.78,False

I wasn’t expecting much since my last experience with Tinder didn’t go well, but I was pleasantly surprised. Our first date went really well. We met at a coffee shop, talked for a while, and got to know each other. After that, we went to a bookstore, talked about manga we like, and even recommended some to each other.

Jake and I are both very busy, we each have two jobs, and he’s also a college student. Because of our schedules, our second time meeting up was more casual, a car date where we watched a TV show, cuddled, and made out.

Our third date was at a movie theater. During the movie, Jake was pretty handsy (touching my thighs). Afterward, we talked in his car and made out. We didn’t have sex, but I did give him head.

The next time we met up, we had sex.
The most recent time, we also had sex.

For context we do text each other regularly, and we have another date planned that isn’t just sexual.

Recently, I asked him what he’s looking for, not to pressure him into a relationship, but to see if we’re on the same page.

Jake said that because he’s so busy with work and school, he’s not actively planning to be in a relationship, but if one happens, he’s open to it. I asked if that meant he just wanted a friends-with-benefits situation. He said “yes, but also no.” He wants to get to know me better, but he also believes that having sex helps you see who a person really is.

He also mentioned that he has trust issues, specifically that people can be with someone for a long time and then change once they get comfortable. I’m not sure if this is tied to his past relationship, but he did bring up that one of the issues in that relationship was his high sex drive. He felt like they weren’t having sex enough, while his ex felt like he didn’t give her a break. (He said they were having sex about once a week.)

I like him. I know that’s not super clear in the post, but he really is sweet and always checks in to make sure I’m comfortable before we do anything. He even noticed that I tensed up before I asked him what he was looking for.

I don’t mind waiting and getting to know him better. I want to spend more time together outside of sex. However, I don’t want to be stuck in a situationship for too long. Ultimately, I do want to be his girlfriend, but I don’t know if I’m rushing things.

I also don’t have much dating experience, so I’m not sure what a “normal” timeline looks like.

He also takes a 4% cut of tips from large parties. I signed up to work for a small family business. This guy aquired the business earlier this year and has absolutely destroyed every aspect of the job that was once rewarding. He even has gone so far as to charge servers for sodas/coffee consumed on shift.

One of the comments people usually have about the game is the low level of interaction between players, and the fact that in the end you don’t really need that many energy points that everything is giving you, and several “Neat Stuff” cards end up being used only to gain victory points.

Playing with a very competitive friend, we found the time restriction to be very short for what we wanted to achieve, since we were very immersed in the game; it occurs to me that a new space—such as a coffee shop where you could delay the sun by one space to extend the game a bit—could be something interesting.

We met through a mutual friend, Mya (22F). From the beginning, Jamie and I didn’t get along. It felt like a constant competition for Mya’s attention, and I often caught Jamie staring at us whenever Mya and I talked. I’ll admit I eventually matched her energy by staring back, which I know wasn’t mature.

Things eventually settled, and when Mya left for a two-week vacation, Jamie and I ended up spending time alone together. We realized we shared a lot of interests and quickly became close. I genuinely grew to love her and considered her my best friend.

A few months into the friendship, Jamie’s behavior changed. What she called “play fighting” became aggressive. She would jump on me from behind, knock me over, and hit me hard enough that I started bruising. I ruined multiple work outfits and coffee because of it. I never fought back because I was older and physically stronger. When I asked her to stop, she listened but wouldn’t make eye contact, and the behavior didn’t fully stop.

Eventually, we formed a larger friend group. I was the oldest, and while I cared about everyone, Jamie’s behavior kept escalating. Arguments became frequent, and I tried to fix things by inviting the group to a convention I attend every year and know very well.

At the convention, Jamie insisted on leading despite it being her first time. She ignored me when I tried to help, repeatedly split the group up to shop, and guilt-tripped others into paying for her. I felt disrespected and overwhelmed and ended up leaving early.

Weeks later, I finally confronted her about everything—the physical aggression, the convention, and how she made me feel. She dismissed my concerns, twisted my words, and portrayed herself as the victim. That’s when I realized the friendship wasn’t healthy, so I walked away.

I explained my decision to the rest of the group. They supported me, and some admitted Jamie had treated them poorly too. Months later, I found out Jamie had been telling people I ruined her life and took her friends, which isn’t true—I never asked anyone to choose sides.

I still get side comments and judgment from people who believe her.

I would really appreciate some advice on how to deal with this in the future without it getting in the way. It would also be nice to receive mental advice on how I can get over this so called 'breakup'

You told me the divorce ""came out of nowhere"", but the truth is, I didn't just give up on you. I know you hadn't physically cheated on me at the time, but I knew that I had already lost you to her. My mind had been made up for some time after learning about her, the way you talked about her at your work. The way you would pull your phone back when she texted you. The secrecy, the way you shut down about everything. 

It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make in my life. But I pulled that trigger and was out of our house in ~3 days. I am still in debt for the loans I took out to afford my new apartment. I probably will be paying for it for the next several years. I did what I had to do.

I loved you more than anything in the entire world. I wished you had seen that, the way I would wake up early to make you coffee, the back rubs, listening to the new songs you made and picking out a couple of specific things to complement them on. It was always intentional. But it seemed to never be enough.

I know it wasn't easy with my severe fatigue and constant weird health issues. But I did the absolute best that I could. I don't think you will ever know that. I just wish you didn't think sex/intimacy was equal to love; I know things slowed down a lot in that capacity, but that didn't change anything in the way I loved you. But it did change how you loved me. It's just too damn bad.

I hope she is everything that you've ever wanted. Some strange part of me feels like you are still lonely, but that doesn't concern me anymore. You made sure of it.

I feel like I have undergone a complete rebirth of who I am as a person. In 2026 I plan to take care of me, in every way.

Goodbye.

The main thing I'm wondering is for places that take reservations or pre-notice for 10-20 people?

\- ability for me to make 6pm reservations on Sat or Sun (I will give at least one-week notice)  
\- less than $20 a plate  
\- full menu (so no coffee or boba places)  
\- within Jefferson County or North Shelby County  
\- dedicated parking

Most SEO advice is ""safe"" and generic (like ""write high-quality content""), but it doesn’t tell you what to do when you’re staring at a spreadsheet of 500 keywords.

If you’re already updating old content and matching search intent, you’re actually ahead of 80% of beginners. To move from ""vague"" to ""practical,"" here is the advice I’d give if we were grabbing a coffee in Colombo:

# 1. Stop ""Writing Blogs,"" Start ""Solving Problems""

Search intent isn't just a category (Informational vs. Transactional); it’s a specific question.

* **The Practical Test:** Google your target keyword. Look at the top 3 results. Do they have a table? A calculator? A bulleted list at the top?
* **The Action:** If the top results are all ""Top 10"" lists and you wrote a 2,000-word ""Ultimate Guide"" essay, you will never rank. **Match the format, then beat the depth.**

# 2. The ""Local Power"" Shortcut (Specific to [SEO Sri Lanka](https://www.shawebdesign.com/seo))

In a smaller market like SL, you don't need 10,000 backlinks. You need **Local Relevance.**

* **Google Business Profile (GBP) is 50% of the battle:** If you have a physical presence or serve a specific area (e.g., ""Web Design Colombo""), your GBP is more important than your blog.
* **Hyper-Local Backlinks:** One link from a `.lk` domain or a local directory like *Yamu* or *Rainbow Pages* is often worth more than five generic `.com` links from a random guest post site.

# 3. Use the ""Search Console"" Goldmine

Stop looking at Ahrefs or Semrush for a second and live in **Google Search Console (GSC).**

* **The Strategy:** Look for keywords where you are ranking on **Page 2 (Positions 11–20).** \* **The Fix:** These are pages Google *wants* to rank but needs a reason to. Add a better H2 tag with that specific keyword, add one fresh internal link from your homepage to that page, or add an FAQ section answering a related question. This is the fastest way to see a ""jump"" in traffic.

# 4. Technical SEO: The ""Don't Annoy the User"" Rule

Don't get bogged down in complex code. For a beginner, technical SEO is just:

* **Speed:** If it takes more than 3 seconds to load on a Dialog/Mobitel 4G connection, you're losing people. Use **Squoosh app** to compress every single image before uploading.
* **Mobile First:** 60-70% of SL traffic is mobile. Open your site on your phone. If you have to ""pinch and zoom"" to read a button, fix it immediately.

# 5. The ""Topic Cluster"" Framework

Instead of writing 10 random posts about SEO, Gardening, or Tech, pick **one pillar.**

* Write one massive guide (The Pillar).
* Write 5 small, specific posts (The Spokes) that link back to the Pillar.
* This tells Google: ""I am an authority on this specific topic,"" not just a guy with a blog.",1,1766809806.0,u_kushanharsha,0,1.0,False
1pwooyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/RENPHOLife/comments/1pwooyj/how_did_you_spend_your_christmas_holiday/,🎁How Did You Spend Your Christmas Holiday?🎁,"Christmas Day has a way of slipping by softly, almost unnoticed, until you realize how full it was. Maybe it began early, with coffee reheated twice and wrapping paper underfoot. Or maybe it started late, sunlight already high, the house quiet after a long night of celebration.

Some days were spent moving, driving across town, hopping between homes, squeezing in hellos and hugs. Others stayed beautifully still: cooking at an unhurried pace, grazing all afternoon, settling into familiar corners with full plates and fuller conversations. There were small pauses, too, the kind that happen without planning. A walk outside. A moment alone in the bedroom. Sitting down longer than expected, just because it felt good.

At RENPHO, those in-between moments matter. So we’re curious: how did you actually spend your Christmas Day this year? From the first hour to the last, share what it looked like for you.",1,1766809761.0,RENPHOLife,0,1.0,False
1pwooiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1pwooiy/why_does_my_ex_girlfriends_vgina_never_smell_no/,Why does my ex girlfriends v*gina never smell. No matter what.,"hello first off I hope I don’t offend anyone I’m just genuinely really interested in this. I’m in my 30s and I have had my share of experiences with different woman sexually. however 99 percent of women I’ve been with at some point will have a smell to there vagina. weather it’s just being out for the whole day and not cleaning before getting together or having a cream pie effect their ph level. I also understand food, the menstrual cycle, different foods, products, hormones, etc, all the other natural factors which Im completely comfortable with. some girls can have a smell that’s really not nice at all and some girls just have a subtle smell. Sometimes it’s often or sometimes it’s only when not completely clean. I’ve experienced different levels of it. But any woman I would spend more time with and have multiple sexual experiences with would eventually have a smell I can smell. Weather kind of Pleasant, or sometimes a turn off. However I spent 1 year with my ex girlfriend sleeping in the same bed and living in the same home. To be honest I’m not the cleanest guy, my body or my mouth, but I try to always be clean before sex unless it’s just happening really natural, and unplanned like preferably, and more often then planned or delaying our wants to be clean up and then perform. the only smell she has ever had is the chicken she fry’s at work. she was poor, and I was living in south east Asia at the time. she provided some things but I provided a lot for her. So I knew how much makeup and self care she would be doing every morning and night. compared to a western women she was basically not wearing make up. She would use baby powder alot which I hated because it can cause cancer and it’s proven to be very bad for you unless you buy an expensive kind. she took birth control so I would finish inside more often then not, she always would go to the bathroom and put some water after. she worked 10-12 hours a day in the hottest part of the world. she was insecure of her skin browning even though it was already, and always wore a lot of cloths to cover also just sun protection too. ( if it was me I would sweat even more). she loved coffee which I remember even as a teenager realizing that was changing the taste of my girlfriend at the times vagina to be like more sour. anyway no matter what at any point at any day my ex girlfriends vagina would not smell and would taste like water. I never noticed a taste when her period cycle would start ( but this is the only time i can’t say for a 100 percent fact through each day during a period she tasted like water) I didn’t eat when there was blood from what I remember but I might be wrong. I don’t get it how does she work 10-12 hours sometimes not showering in the morning in the hot heat sweating driving across town twice and she tastes and smells like water? she did not use drugs or tobacco and very rarely alcohol. her diet wasn’t really consistent, she would put money together with friends at work and eat different things. she ate a lot of rice. another thing she never got enough sleep, sometimes she would work on her computer after work and stay up late. if she didn’t do that she still did not get enough sleep. maybe sleeping at 12 and waking up 5:30-6:30. I was addicted to very hard drugs at the time that she didn’t know existed until me so she also had a lot of stress in her life. we would fight alot and I was really out of my mind so it was really unfair for her and I can’t imagine how many different negative emotions she had felt at the time towards that situation.( I think stress can alone change hormones and the scent of a vagina, maybe I’m wrong?) anyway what is different about her? the only thing I can come up with is from what I know she’s from the countryside and probably hasn’t had as much preservatives and chemicals? but I can be wrong because she has faced poverty and for example eating street food can have old reused oils, lots of salts and sugars and a whole lot I don’t even know. so that could be wrong she could have been exposed to as much or even more harmful chemicals in food then me in the western world… anybody can relate or have an idea why she was special in this way? she also had hair down there which for me it collects sweat etc. lol I’m sorry that’s the last detail…I’m trying to get as much details as possible. anyways thanks in advance ladies and gentlemen…I hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday this year!!!",0,1766809722.0,Healthyhooha,6,0.29,False

1pwomgu,https://i.redd.it/cmppfaiqao9g1.jpeg,Basementgate . . . ?,"Obviously people are having a lot of Byler doubt atm and basementgate is unconfirmed, but just have some fun with me for a second.

Personally I have a fair amount of faith in basementgate, seeing as WSQK keeps mentioning stuff that is both awfully suggestive and awfully Byler-related. Some examples being the following. Italics indicate a *suggestive tone*, bold is **Byler-related**. I found all of these on the WSQK Lore doc, but I've also been listening to it on my own and have personally heard several of these too:

* ""Cover the door leading to the basement with a rug and the **pipe**.""
* ""The basement - that’s the best place you’re gonna hunker down and get back that *good* **signal.**""
* ""...ghosts in the **basement,** keep it locked. The cemetery is a totally normal place to hang out. Shake off last nights demons, the Maple Street Midnight Crew, lights flickering at Maple Street. I hope you're **both** not afraid of the dark. Grab **coffee** and **soda** and stay up all night watching *movies*.""
* ""Lock the door to the **basement** to not get interrupted.""
* ""This next one is for Freddie, Jed, Ollie, and Becks, throwing some dice down in the **basement** of their mom’s house and tucking into some pizza! Now, you gotta **try before you deny** this, but for me, it’s all about **pineapple** and jalapeno **on a pizza**. It's a wicked combo.""

Sooo I'm having fun thinking up ideas on how this could happen with where we're at going into Vol 3. They're all in the Upside Down now, which is very unromantic, but we also got a touching scene between Nancy & Jonathan in the Upside Down. Feel like they could make it work. My theory is that Mike & Will are going to be paired in the last episode for whatever mission, and they'll have to take shelter in a basement for a while.
