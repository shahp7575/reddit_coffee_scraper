1lpioph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1lpioph/lunch_spot_suggestions/,Lunch spot suggestions,"I‚Äôve been trying to come up with somewhere to go out for lunch with my mum on Monday and am struggling to find somewhere suitable, despite a couple of hours of googling. There are a few criteria that make it a bit tricky, so I thought I‚Äôd post here to see if anyone has suggestions that might work? 

Mum is in her mid 70s and in poor health with poor mobility and significant back issues. She uses a walker to get around but can‚Äôt walk very far, so ideally it needs to be a venue with a car park on site and space to open the passenger door really wide, so as to bring her walker right up to her to assist with getting in and out of the car (she has a disability parking permit.) That in itself isn‚Äôt so much the issue I‚Äôm having but definitely needs to be factored in to any suggestions. 

The other criteria I‚Äôm trying to meet to go with this are:

- comfortable, padded chairs as the standard wood or metal chairs in most pubs and cafes are too painful for her to sit for more than a few minutes and any padded booths I‚Äôve come across are in beer gardens, which will be too cold at this time of year

- a menu that isn‚Äôt just all day breakfast, as she won‚Äôt enjoy that

- inexpensive.. preferably some meal options that aren‚Äôt more than around $20. The lunch is for my 50th birthday and mum will insist on paying but she‚Äôs only on an age pension, so I‚Äôm very mindful of it not costing too much. I‚Äôm more than happy to pay for everything but she‚Äôll get upset if I do. She doesn‚Äôt eat much, so I‚Äôm even happy to just do coffee and cake somewhere, but I can‚Äôt find anywhere that also has comfortable seating for her

- she‚Äôs near Arndale and it‚Äôs a half hour drive each way to her place from where I am, so I‚Äôd like to try and stick to something that isn‚Äôt more than 20 minutes or so from her place if I can, but further isn‚Äôt a deal breaker 

I did come up with The Royal Oak in North Adelaide, as they have three $20 lunch options (one of which is her go to of fish and chips) and padded seats in the dining room, but I‚Äôm worried about car parking. I know there‚Äôs some parking on site but most of it won‚Äôt allow me to open her door all the way to get her in and out of the car and I‚Äôm not sure about managing this with the supermarket carpark next door? 

If you made it to the end of my essay, thanks so much for reading and for any options that you can recommend for us. ",1,1751417901.0,Adelaide,0,1.0,False

1lpim8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1lpim8y/mil_and_her_boyfriend_breaking_boundaries_and/,MIL and her boyfriend breaking boundaries and harassing.,"We are in no contact with MIL she is not to talk to me or my children. Go to previous posts for more context.

She showed up by our house where my family was sitting to see the parade. She brought her boyfriend, which she knows he's not to be around my children and clearly has been told this multiple times. He has a problem with not listening. And it showed today that they don't care about boundaries, and their sense of entitlement is beyond frightening.

The first words that came out of my mouth when they walked  behind us was, No. Stay away from my kids. He starts grabbing at my daughter, then goes to me where I am sitting and starts touching my 6 month old that I am holding. Again, I said, ""Stop touching my children. You are not to go near my children."" I put my arm up in front of my baby, and he flicks my cheek. I told my SO this is the time where you stand up for me! My anxiety was really bad at this point. 

He flat out said I did not do that. When I sure as hell would know if something had physical contact to my face. He literally did it where no one but him and MIL could see. 

MIL proceeds to tell me well we should go for coffee. Ummmm? no!? I told her, ""You know I do not like (MILs boyfriend), and you still bring him around."" He gets in my face and tells me the feelings mutual. I respond, I knew that for a long time for how you treat me. 

He was getting in my SO face. After us repeatedly telling them to go. SO said you always do this, show up to cause drama. Then MILs boyfriend says to us We aren't the ones starting drama.""

If I am correct, isn't it them who is giving us unwanted contact, while we are minding our own buisness? 

I finally said to them I'm going to file a complaint on you because this is harassment."" He responded, ""Then do it,"" and he was aggressive with what he spoke.

I wrote it down, and then I did call the police and made a complaint. 

The cops went to their house and talked to them to leave us alone. The officer called me back and said, ""Well, we got their side of the story too."" (These are people who are manipulative and gaslight and play victim) What the officer told me is that they are frustrated because they have done a lot for us and they can't even see the grandchildren. (Her boyfriend helped SO with teaching him how to fix up his car, or his mom helped him out with certain here and there. And she ALWAYS through it in SO face. I never one wanted to ask for anything from that woman!

Excuse me? How the hell does this have ANYTHING to do with the fact we don't want them around our children, and there is no excuse for what happened.

This woman and man must have said something pretty convincing to make him not talk to them more stern. He also said that he told them you guys have to have a mutual respect? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And added at the end of the day they are your children so it's entirely up to you ehat you do. And that was pretty much it and said, ""Have a good day.""

I am at a complete LOSS. We are considering moving if this doesn't stop. I just had to share this because I think it's wild and so bazaar that these people think they can act this way and get away with it, especially to the law! ",1,1751417698.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

1lpilsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lpilsm/my_twin_sister_thinks_its_a_bad_idea_for_my/,"My twin sister thinks it‚Äôs a bad idea for my girlfriend to be living with me and our family. Then, she blew up at my girlfriend and left her crying. My family is on my side and my sister thinks we‚Äôre all crazy.","This is going to be super long, so stay with me.

I, 19M have been with my girlfriend 19F who will call Carmen for almost 4 years now. I will be using fake names for everyone for privacy reasons.

My family consists my dad (40M), my oldest sisters Kate (22F) and Helen (24F), my mom (41F), my younger sisters Judy (4F) and Lucy (5F), and my twin sister Rachel (19F). My mom and my dad have been divorced since I was 12 and Judy as well as Lucy are my half sisters. Judy is on my dad‚Äôs side and Lucy is on my mom‚Äôs.

It all dates back to almost 4 months ago. I was helping my dad fix my car when Carmen called me hysterical, I asked her to calm down and try to explain to me. Between sobs, she told me her father had just been deported. Now, Carmen‚Äôs family is Hispanic while mine is white. I have a big family while she‚Äôs the baby of the family and has two older brothers. This news was very unexpected as her father is a well known and kind man. Never hurt a fly. He taught me how to cook their cultural foods, how to fish, stories of his home, and even gave me his blessing incase I wanted to ever marry Carmen in the future. I‚Äôve known this man since I was 14 and I was upset myself to hear the news.

Her brothers, Lucas (25M) and Marco (23M) are very far from her and were the first to get the news. Their dad called Lucas and broke the news as their dad works in many different places for his job. Lucas told Marco who told Carmen. Carmen was home and she realized she wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to afford the rent or any bills her dad was paying. Lucas and Marco were moved out with their own things. Lucas was three states away with his wife and two kids and another on the way and Marco was in college in a whole other country.

Carmen, having no where to go called me. For extra background, Carmen has always been hardworking, and working at her job since 16. But even with her pay she wouldn‚Äôt afford the home her dad was paying off and the bills. I immediately told my dad the situation and he said she was more than welcome to stay with us.

I got her to relax and said we‚Äôd be at her place to help her pack as much as she could. After we did arrive, she was a mess. As we helped her pack, she took breaks to just cry and sobbed the entire time having to pack her dad‚Äôs things up. We put all the other things that weren‚Äôt technically hers into a storage room we used for our own stuff. After she got everything she needed, we got back to my house and helped her unpack and she was staying in my room.

I told Carmen to take a nap and calm down and we‚Äôd talk about everything when she was awake and stable. My dad and I sat my sisters down and explained it to them. Kate and Helen were very sad for her and willing to help her, but Rachel was very hesitant. She said Carmen was a grown woman and was able to go find apartments and her own storage. My dad got angry at her and said that she was still a young woman and just got her life torn and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. That shut Rachel up but little did I know it would bring more trouble.

My dad ended up calling my mom and explaining it to her and she understood. My family loves Carmen, since we first started dating as 14 year olds they loved her. Carmen is so kind, very beautiful, hardworking and knows how to be respectful and loving. She loves babysitting my sisters and hanging out with my older sisters. She helped my dad with some tools since her dad worked with them and even learned things from my mom since Carmen‚Äôs own mom was very absent in her life.

After Carmen woke up, she began to explain in tears she‚Äôd manage her job, pay any rent or bills, buy food and offered to cook and clean. Even offering to take extra shifts at her job because she doesn‚Äôt like to be in a home and be sluggish or not helping. I told her she had to calm down to which my dad, being the man of the home told her he wouldn‚Äôt charge her anything and she could be in her routine she always had. The only thing my dad asked is once I‚Äôm ready to move out, she‚Äôd have to as he‚Äôs heard us talking about moving in together. And to just remember her manners and all. Carmen was relieved but still had her guard up.

The first month living with Carmen was amazing. Even if we told her she didn‚Äôt have to, she would cook and clean the home and would take extra shifts here and there. She managed laundry and watched over Judy. She even fixed the shower drain when it clogged and the sink when the tap was leaking. Carmen was amazing around the house and we even got to spend more time together and learn how to accommodate each other staying in the same room and getting intake for the future when we moved in together. Until month 2, when my sister Rachel comes into the picture.

Rachel has been my best friend before birth, my built in one. Being twins was amazing since we had our own inside jokes and our adventures. Until 5th grade, when she began to just be mean and shut everyone out which followed into her teen years. Rachel got into the wrong friend groups and did drugs and some vaping. As much as my family put their foot down, tried to be extremely nice, and even give silent treatment Rachel never budged and got worse.

But by 8th grade she was Carmen‚Äôs friend before I even met her. She would mention Carmen around me but I always thought it was another of her dumb friends until I had a class with her and it‚Äôs been history since. Rachel and Carmen were best friends even but now since everything has happened Rachel has gotten sour with Carmen.

Rachel lives with my mom and has a strained relationship with my dad but when she comes to see Judy and me, Carmen tries to make small talk but Rachel either ignores her or gives backhanded comments. Sometimes she even just asks Carmen bluntly when she‚Äôll move out. I‚Äôve gotten into arguments with Rachel telling her she can‚Äôt talk to my girlfriend like that but Rachel ignores me or gets defensive telling me family comes first and I shouldn‚Äôt be trying to turn against her.

Month 3 is when everything came crashing down. It should‚Äôve been the first warning to avoid the big event. My dad, Kate, Helen, Judy, me, Rachel and Carmen were having dinner discussing how we‚Äôd spend Lucy‚Äôs birthday since she invited us all. Carmen was excited and had discussed with my mom on making the cake, Carmen is an amazing baker and never fails to make me full in the best way possible. Carmen showed her ideas since Lucy‚Äôs birthday theme was a Shark and aquatic theme. That‚Äôs when Rachel scoffed loudly and said ‚ÄúNo one really cares if you‚Äôre baking a cake, genuinely just stop talking you‚Äôre giving me a headache.‚Äù The room went silent and Carmen had tears in her eyes but apologized and just remained quiet or only speaking when spoken too. After the dinner, I got mad and yelled at Rachel telling her she couldn‚Äôt say that and I understood if she had a headache, but all of our family was talking and she didn‚Äôt complain then. Rachel got defensive and told me I was selfish for choosing Carmen over her and we were twins, saying we stick together.

My dad told me Rachel was just being moody and to let it go and maybe she established a boundary that came out to harsh to Carmen. I told him he didn‚Äôt understand and that Rachel can‚Äôt be mean to her.

I comforted Carmen and told her it was gonna be okay. Carmen understood Rachel‚Äôs side but I was hesitant and thought she was probably just trying to understand to not seem like the victim. Carmen is very sympathetic and so kind hearted but she hates being center of attention and hates getting people in trouble. She‚Äôs too kind but also very emotional. I told her it‚Äôs okay to cry because it was mean.

Now the big thing comes in. Being very foolish, Carmen got pregnant. We used protection but it did fail, she cried and told me she was willing to consider an abortion but I said we could handle this and I was already looking into apartments that both our salary‚Äôs could cover. I was actually a little excited to be a dad but also asked her input. Carmen‚Äôs always wanted to be a mother, she is very good with kids and loves kids. She only would go with what was best for me and her and would never want to ‚Äúbaby trap‚Äù me. But I said we‚Äôd manage and get through this together for the sake of our child.


We told my family and they were all happy for us. My sisters and mom gave her advice and offered to help her during the pregnancy, my mom kinda scolded me for being foolish. But other than that, she was excited to be a grandma. Helen made a joke she was surprised out of everyone I‚Äôd be the first to have a kid. 

After a while, Carmen was on the couch getting advice from my mom, my dad, and their partners on how to care for kids, what to expect, and how to be prepared. Everyone was happy, but Rachel.

As my family was helping with dinner, talking, and making sure Lucy and Judy were in their sight, from what I heard later on from Carmen, Rachel had cornered her at the upstairs hallways and was telling her she babytrapped me and she was gonna regret it.

Rachel‚Äôs always had weird humor and jokes and ways of saying it, so Carmen thought maybe she was overly sarcastic. As Carmen when downstairs Rachel shoved her almost making her trip on the last step but she was okay just startled.

Rachel blew up at Carmen and screamed at her, raising her voice by the minute. She accused Carmen of being a baby trapping bitch, telling her she wasn‚Äôt good enough for me, she even accused her of cheating on me and maybe the baby wasn‚Äôt even mine. Everyone began to get involved trying to calm the situation but Rachel began to scream ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why your dad was taken! You‚Äôre nothing but a sl*tty b*tch! You‚Äôre so lazy and you live with us rent free. I hope that mistake d*es!!‚Äù And a lot more horrible things. 

The room was silent and it seems everything stopped around us. Carmen began to sob and ran off to my room. My mom began to lose control and scream at Rachel, telling her she had no room to speak. Rachel had no job, didn‚Äôt pay anything, and just begged my mom for money to go to the movies with her girlfriend. Kate and Helen were backing mom up and saying she was harsh and completely in the wrong, and Carmen was never a baby trapper. My dad was a very big gentle giant, so his tone was scarily calm, telling Rachel to get her stuff and just go home. Get her girlfriend to pick her up and leave.

Rachel yelled at everyone saying they‚Äôre all turning against her, that we were under some sort of spell and Carmen was blinding us all. She looked at me and gave me the same ramble she always did. Calling me a traitor before i asked her to leave.

After she left, everyone was still mad or tense with the situation and I went to Carmen. Carmen was in our room crying and telling me she was gonna get rid of the baby. I told her not to, that I knew she didn‚Äôt want to and neither did I. She agreed she didn‚Äôt want to but she didn‚Äôt wanna trap me. I told her she wasn‚Äôt trapping me and I was so excited to be a dad. After a long talk, I got her to calm down and take a nap to not be stressed.

Now, Rachel told our extended family, mutual friends, and even my ex girlfriend, Victoria (19F) that Carmen was baby trapping me, it was obvious, that Carmen was cheating and my family turned on her. Now I‚Äôm getting texts from family and friends, some asking the truth as they knew Rachel‚Äôs scheme, and some called me cold, sent threats hoping something happened to my kid, and some saying I could‚Äôve not betrayed my twin. 

Victoria reached out through social media, telling me she was always here for me and I could talk to her. Saying we could meet up for coffee and even get revenge on Carmen. Background on Victoria: Me and her dated when we‚Äôre 13, only for 4 months but we were close friends before it. Like best friends. And she hated Carmen when she began to date me. Telling everyone I was cheating on her with Carmen, Carmen was a wh*re, and she hoped we didn‚Äôt last and kept stalking me and wanting to reach out. At some point, she befriended Carmen and manipulated my poor girlfriend into believing she was a nice person. Trying to get information on me from her, keeping in touch with her, wanting to get any chance for her to ‚Äúslip up‚Äù and be mean to her. Victoria would be mean to her and dry but Carmen would excuse it as maybe depression or whatever. I told Carmen Victoria was a manipulator and wasn‚Äôt good news but Carmen was hesitant. I blocked Victoria and told anyone who believed Rachel the true story.

Some family and friends who believed her did switch sides and apologized, others still think I was mean or I‚Äôm lying. I‚Äôm now in the process of putting a payment on our apartment and trying to move out faster to avoid Rachel. My dad supports my decision and offered to help move stuff to not stress Carmen and to help with payments.

Carmen tries to reach out to Rachel to apologize and talk, but Rachel screenshots it and posts it on her story saying it‚Äôs manipulation and calls her a snake. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. Rachel is my twin sister but she has gone too far, and even in the first month, I‚Äôm trying to care for Carmen as her pregnancy progresses. Advice will be the biggest help. What do I do? Do I continue comforting my girlfriend and moving or do I just focus on the fact my sister is saying these things? This is Rachel, and I feel like she‚Äôs planning something or wanting some ‚Äúpayback‚Äù on me and Carmen. This is stressful and intense.

They've had legal problems in past seasons for filming in a residential house without any permit. Before they started filming this season they got a cease and desist letter, and during the investor stream they basically hinted at what happened (show ending after 2 weeks). People are now saying they knew it was gonna get shut down from the start and was a planned rugpull for some easy money. They've been leading everyone on, especially the last 3-4 days when they pretended they were about to go live any second until the very last second when they announced it was over. Overally greedy and shady behavior, the show became mostly focused on cash grabs, for example ""stox"" which you could invest in for your favorite contestant, which couldn't be cashed back in and became pointless when the show was cancelled out of the blue. They also had a multi-day challenge focused around getting viewers to pay for candy deliveries to their favorite fish (whoever had the most candy won), not illegal but greedy nonetheless.

My main symptoms are phantom smell and taste in my mouth kinda metallic or just slightly odd. I have a pretty bad anxiety and hyper vigilance disorder which arose at the same time I was drinking highly caffeinated coffee beverages two years ago.

I was just wondering if anyone experienced anything similar in regard to coffee. I have been stuck with decaf for the past two years. Some places like Tim Hortons / McDonalds don‚Äôt offer decaf for cold beverages so it‚Äôs hard to find reasonable products. I can drink plenty Soda or Tea with no problem.

1lpij5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1lpij5w/could_really_use_some_support_and_encouragement/,Could really use some support and encouragement today,"Hello, I've been lurking on this site for awhile. I have a lot of social anxiety, possible cptsd, and depression. Yes I am taking medication for it, seeing a therapist, and seeing a psychiatrist and primary physician. Overall I manage it well, but because of everything I've been through I live a relatively isolated life at the moment. This does not mean it will always be the case, it's just the best thing for me to do at the moment. I havent really found zepbound to make any of this worse as if anything it seems to have a relaxing and calming effect. So just to clarify that's not what this post is about. It's just because I'm pretty siolated I dont really have a supportive BFF etc. To encourage me and havent really let a lot of People know I'm taking the drug. I truly wish my dog spoke English but he doesnt. I am rather adverse to sharing photos and have only been on the drug almost three months so not very long.

I guess I am posting this on side effects because in the course of those months my dose has been increased every single month. Im now at 7.5 and would like to stay at that level for awhile. I saw the post below regarding side effects with an increase in side effects as the dose increases and I have to say I have definitely and am experiencing that. I suppose I am lucky in that I havent had any vomiting etc. On the other hand I've been COLD really cold and often very fatigued. I am eating enough calories but admit I do struggle somewhat with the exercise component. My depression has always made it difficult but the fatigue has never really let up as a result of increasing. So most weeks I am exercising about three times a week which feels pretty lousy compared to some of the posts I see about people going to the gym five or six days. I know comparison is not fair but it's said that zepbound is a lifestyle change and as such it seems only fair that requires a considerable amount of discipline and I can't help but wonder if I'm the only one stepping into it slowly. It just seems like everyone here kind of snapped to it.

As for the cold, well I live in a temperate and coastal area and never really adjusted to the constant slight damp cold. This areas lacks true seasons so to speak. So right now I've had some coffee and am trying to get out on one 10,000 step walk...but I'm just so tired and the wind has kicked up and I feel like a grumpy old women in a base layer and a wool sweater with the heater jacked up to 74. I did some jogging yesterday so truthfully I'd rather just huddle in bed under tons of layers to keep me warm and nap or just lie here. Just...exhausted. I see alot of photos of people showing off their new bodies and I think it's great. I just can't because I'm too cold to all the time. Movement would help circulate the blood flow but I just dont know if I'm up for it.

I guess that's all. I have bruising at the injection area site and had redness and itchiness this week around. It's a beautiful day out and I'm just kind of bummed out I suppose that I'm feeling too tired to go enjoy it. Yes, I realize it passes in time but as I said I've increased the dosage each month and have never really had a break.

Apologies for the long rant and apologies if it seems meaningless. I guess I just needed to get it out to someone who hopefully will get it...",2,1751417448.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

1lpic1a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lpic1a,A British 24 hr GP Ration with Fantastic Oatmeal?,"Hi folks!

A 2023 packed British GP, menu 10!

This is from era where there are no ""or"" statements on the menu listings. Newer ones seem to always indicate one entree ""or"" another, so you never know what you're actually getting until you crack it open! I would think it would be easier to simply state ""Entrees can be substituted as needed"" or similar, but I guess the ""or"" statements work too.

Pics 1-5 show packaging, contents, and tell me how I'm going to prison if the ration was purchased....good thing it was gifted (for any agents reading). 

Pic 6 is the star of the show here! Instant porridge! But what made it so great you ask, the fact it got all the peanut butter mixed into it! Magnificent! Slightly sweet, savory,  rich, creamy, and hearty! A very nice dish that really made me wonder why US MREs lack this simple item (oatmeal essentially). Some IMPs have it, and it's great in there too!

Pic 7 was the absolute most boring part of this ration, well, maybe....don't be deceived by the appearance here, this Burrito style filling is so bland my grandma would have asked for a dash of flavor. I do not like Sambal at all, so this got an entire MCW glass bottle of tobasco added to it along with black pepper and a dash of salt. Made it edible at least. I can't believe any sort of taco style filling can be this bland. Just copy the US MRE Menu 6!

Pic 8 is the Hunters Stew! This was a very nice dish I have actually experienced before, in a new Lithuanian ration, that has the exact same main, because, for some reason, they decided to copy and paste the British rations now for their own country (RIP grandma made Lithuanian mains of old üòû). A very nice experience consisting of a blend of chicken, cheese, potatos, BBQ sauce, and peas!

Pic 9 is a vanilla cake, a glorious masterpiece of shelf stable science combined with Gordon Ramsey style elegance! Moist, sweet, and delicious.  Had the PB not gone in the porridge it  would have gone on top this cake!

Pic 10 is the Apricot Oat biscuits. These little hockey pucks are fantastic! The perfect combination of slightly sweet and crunchy. So satisfying by themselves or paired with other elements. I think I prefer these over the PB Oat Biscuits in some GPs. 

Pic 11 is hard to talk about folks. I've already written my congressman and they were like ""thanks for writing but what are you rambling on about...."" These ""Just Nuts"" blends are truly terrible. That may not be a popular opinion, but about the only way I can imagine messing up the worldly combo of cashews,  almonds, and peanuts, is if they didn't give you enough, but these people have found an even worse way. Not roasting or salting them. You simply do not understand what has occurred here until you eat these because, I'm guessing here, about 80+% of us have never had any unroasted nuts, particularly peanuts, which means they taste like beans....yeah, beans, I mean, they are legumes by default. I simply cannot imagine soldiers saying how great these are and how much they love them. If so, I'd immediately inquire as to whether or not they have ever had roasted nuts. If you made PB out of unroasted peanuts, you'd have the worst hummus ever created üòâ.

Drinks are solid in these British rations, usually. The peach tea one here was not well received by myself or the family,  which was odd for these drinks. Tuti Fruiti went to a buddy (Murica). Still have one or 2 left. The coffees are great in protein powder drinks each morning for a little kick! I don't drink tea, so am getting quite a collection of tea bags again!

Conclusion: even with strong criticism of a few components these rations are a delight and a joy to consume and really are one of my favs ! The oddities add to the experience which is what this is all about! I was sad no flapjacks in this menu, but do have 1 now that has one, so stay tuned! Have another that has something called chocolate pudding with chocolate sauce, so yeah, that sounds like a breakfast for sure (again, for any agents reading, I am very blessed to have been gifted these beauties!).

If anyone wants to trade me something so I can get another ORP, DM me!

1lpi8h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1lpi8h4/i_got_my_surgery_today_0701/,I got my surgery today! (07/01),"A month ago I posted saying I was thinking about backing out but did a lot of mental prep work and got it done today!! 

Here‚Äôs a LONG breakdown of my experience step by step at the hospital because these accounts really helped me but TL;DR is at the bottom.

I pushed fruits and veggies and water hard the few days leading up to my surgery. The night before I washed all my bedding and quarantined my room from my cat. She wasn‚Äôt the happiest. Then I took a shower with antibacterial soap. Had trouble sleeping but ended up with about 4.5 hours worth. I woke up at 3:45 am and drank the pre surgery drink my surgeon provided me at my pre-op appointment. I then took my second shower. My surgery was scheduled for 7:30am but I had to arrive at the hospital at 6:00am.

When I arrived I checked in and the receptionist reviewed all my documents and updated insurance and emergency contact. My mom and husband were with me and they came back to my pre-surgery room but once I was wheeled back to the OR they were given a number I was assigned to and sent to the main waiting room. The tv screen had a display of my number and what was going on so they could see when I was done. 

They called me back, I was weighed, peed in a cup (not pregnant), asked a bunch of questions about health history, allergies, and had to confirm my surgery. Multiple nurses asked me what procedure I was getting done and I had to verbally say it to them but ‚Äúgetting tubes removed‚Äù sufficed. 

They had me change into a gown that hooked up to an air hose that blew hot air. That was nice. They wrapped my calves and I liked the pressure of that as well. Then the nurse placed my IV in my hand I was teary off and on but not as bad as I thought I‚Äôd be. I only ever started crying when someone asked how I was doing.

A resident doctor came in to introduce herself and asked me if I had questions. She rubbed the top of my foot and told me I‚Äôd be okay. I just confirmed with her that this is a super common surgery and I shouldn‚Äôt worry right? Haha. Then the nurse told me my doctor wasn‚Äôt in yet and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay she can get as much sleep and coffee as she needs!‚Äù Lol but my doctor did show up on time. She reviewed potential risks which did scare me (she has to I know) but she said ‚Äúremember, those are possible NOT probable‚Äù and that helped.

My anesthesiologist came in last. He asked if I had questions I said yes one‚Äî ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt let me wake up right?‚Äù He told me he does it every day and has been doing this for 10 years. He ordered me some of the good anxiety meds to be given before I went to the OR. My nurse came back and said ‚Äúokay here‚Äôs your cocktail‚Äù it was funny. The anxiety meds helped. I started crying a lot when my mom said bye and my husband kissed me bye. That was by far the scariest part!! But I was never, not even once, alone the entire time and I‚Äôm so grateful.

The anxiety meds kicked in before I got to the OR. The nurse pushing me back asked if I‚Äôve had surgery before and I said ‚Äúyes but it was before I had a sense of mortality‚Äù she thought it was funny and I remember thinking ‚Äúthe meds must have kicked in.‚Äù

I was super scared for the OR but it actually was bright, cold, and not scary at all. Plus I remember about 30 seconds of it. I moved to the table, they had me scoot, they put a mask on my face. I thought about being on the guardians of the galaxy coaster at Disney world.

I think that when I woke up I dozed back off because they told me I had said I was cold and wanted my family. I was so scared of waking up alone but all i remember is asking for family and then my mom and husband were back. The first thing I said was ‚Äúwere there any complications?‚Äù And they said no! And my husband has pics of before and after that I‚Äôll look at once I‚Äôm healed. My throat was scratchy, not sore, from intubation which I was pleasantly surprised by. My pain was a 6/10 and I won‚Äôt lie, it isn‚Äôt fun, but they gave me meds immediately. 

They had me sip water but didn‚Äôt require me to eat or pee before leaving. I think this is because I reported no nausea when I woke up. I did opt for the nausea patch but expressed concerns about messing with my eye sight. Apparently that only happens if the medicine from the sticky part of the patch gets in your eye (so you touch the patch then touch your eye, or it gets on your pillow.) I was feeling great until I had to try to stand up for the first time. Then I felt a pressure in my ears and I started getting incredibly sweaty. I almost threw up but simply did not allow myself to do so because that seemed like it would hurt. I think the pain meds may have contributed to the nausea combined with sitting up. But then after a few minutes I was able to stand and was walking out! 

All in all I checked in at 6am and was HOME by 11am. Very simple process and procedure. The pain has been rough and I did take the stronger meds they prescribed me. I am a little anxious about accidentally popping open my surgical glue (anxiety found SOMETHING new to worry about) and getting blood clots. I‚Äôve gotten up and walked every hour to two hours based on my naps. Never got nauseated again, still have my patch on. Recovery is not FUN and I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs as easy as it sounds for some people. I think my anesthesia is messing with my emotions because I‚Äôm feeling sad and useless in this recovery process but I am trying to remind myself this is not forever. OVERALL I am thankful I followed through. All the big scary things I worried about with surgery remained big scary things that didn‚Äôt happen. And now I‚Äôm tube free !!


TL; DR: Posted a month ago about almost canceling surgery due to fear of complications, surgery went fine with no complications. It really is as simple as people say. The pain and recovery is a little rougher than was some people say, but manageable. Overall I am thankful I did it! ",6,1751416559.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

I'm sorry I looked away when our eyes first met. Truth is, you melted me like an ice cube left in this torrid summer heat. I wasn't prepared for that encounter. Right, it lasted a second but it's been lingering on my mind since then. 

It was like a month ago. It was a Tuesday and I think about it every day. Of course, it had to be the day I was buying toilet paper, coming back from work sweaty and wearing my worst pairs of black jeans. Oh well! 

Still, the look you gave me ‚Äî unless I misinterpreted it ‚Äî was pretty loaded. Like you'd eat me alive. Animalistic almost. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally into it. That's why I looked away, after giving you my best poker face (or rather my ""resting b*tch face""). I know, I can be pretty stupid at times. I regret it to this day.

Few days later, I came back prepared. I had hand written a note on a pink paper. Something lame I'll admit ‚Äî *""Very nice tattoos :)""* ‚Äî plus my name and phone number. My plan was to hand it to you. It was a Thursday I think, but you weren't there. So I spent money to buy a couple things I didn't need, and walked out. I wanted you, not stupid feta cheese.

Then I came back on a Tuesday this time, to maximize my chances. It was two weeks later, and my little pink paper was still ready for you. As soon as I walked in the Coop, I got mindblown. A true ""what the actual fuck"" moment. 

Because the first thing I saw was the back of your skull, and the tattoo you have there. I didn't get to see it the first time, I only saw your full sleeve when you came at the counter to get a badge while I was shamefully packing away my toilet paper while my heart was racing at an insane BPM. But this specific tattoo, this number repeated three times, I took it as a sign.

The ""why"" is a long story (no, it's not) that I'd rather tell you in person when we go out for coffee ‚Äî or tea or tequila or whatever you're drinking. I truly don't believe in coincidences, so you having that specific tattoo is bat shit crazy to me. Plus you look more like a 666 type of guy, so I'd be really curious to hear your story behind that tattoo.

Anyhow. I came back on a Tuesday, you were here, so dandy and handsome in your *""SECURITY""* shirt. Did my heart skipped a beat? Sure, absolutely, several actually. I wandered and rummaged through the store like a confused chicken, picked some random stuff and headed to the checkout counter.

But. Circumstances were not ideal and mistakes were made. The circumstance being you not being alone at that time ‚Äî you were chatting with another guy, which sabotaged my plan to hand you over my note. The mistake being my melted brain not thinking of going to the self checkout ‚Äî since I bought wine, the machine would have get blocked for age check, you would have had to come to the rescue, getting away from this guy and close to me, and I would have a chance to slip my note. But no. Stupid me didn't do that.

But *stupid me* saw you, seeing me. When I walked out I saw you looking up and away from that guy to give me another one of your glances. A stolen one, straight in my eyes. I looked at you, you looked at me ‚Äî and once again I disappeared in the busy street. So close yet so far. 

Today was Tuesday. I wanted so badly to pass by, try my luck again, not chicken out this time. But. I recently moved to a new apartment, outside of the city. Your Coop is not anymore on my way home. Today I couldn't, but next week I'll make the detour ‚Äî maybe. Or the next. 

Until then, I'm posting this here to take this out of my chest ‚Äî and in crazy hopes that you or someone that knows you lurks around here. 

See you, maybe someday, likely never.

*To all Redditors; shoot your shots, don't be like me. Now I'll be haunted by ""what ifs""*

*And if anyone is extremely extroverted (unlike me) and a regular client of this Coop, feel free to share this story with him! I mean just the short version obviously: ""the blue eyed neck tattooed girl got a mean crush on you, she had planned to give you a note with her number but chickened out"" ‚Äî glorious!*",1,1751416355.0,basel,1,0.99,False
1lpi5wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1lpi5wy/looking_for_the_title_andor_free_link/,Looking for the title and/or free link?,"In the grand hall of Sterling Manor, the Sterling family's sprawling hillside estate in Los Angeles, the air was thick with tension, as if a frost had settled over the stalled negotiations.
""You scheming, manipulative woman! You don't deserve to set foot in our home!"" Margaret Sterling's voice sliced through the room, her glare fixed on Arielle Mitchell, brimming with barely contained fury.
Her perfect son, her pride and joy, trapped by a woman like this? It was unthinkable.
Arielle's ears rang, her vision swimming as she stumbled back, barely catching herself against the wall.
Didn't I already die?
Arielle distinctly remembered driving to her daughter's elementary school orientation when a car slammed into the side of her vehicle, crushing the backseat beyond recognition.
As she was slipping away, she could still feel the blood streaming from her scalp. The only comfort she had was knowing her daughter had left earlier and wasn't in the car with her.
So, where am I now?
The blinding white light in Arielle's vision faded, and the world came back into focus. A sudden weight pressed against her legs.
She looked down to see her daughter, so small and barely reaching her thigh, was now clinging to her tightly.How is this possible?
Then, Margaret's voice cut through again, sharp and accusing. ""Oh, quite the act already!""
She rose from the sofa, pointing at Arielle with a trembling finger. ""Tell Alexander he doesn't need to rush back. A calculating woman like you will never be part of the Sterling family!""
William Sterling, seated at the head of the room, struck his cane against the floor with a resounding thud. ""Enough! You don't speak for the entire Sterling family!""
Margaret shrank back in fear. She had always been intimidated by the stern, old-fashioned patriarch of the family, and she didn't dare talk back. Still, deep down, she couldn't accept his decision at all.
Arielle was the kind of woman who schemed her way into pregnancy after a one-night stand with Alexander, so Margaret didn't see why he should have to marry someone like that. If it came down to it, they could just bring the child home and leave Arielle out of the picture.
The more Margaret thought about it, the angrier she grew. She twisted her husband's arm, who sat meekly beside her, and hissed, ""Say something! Alexander is our eldest son, the heir to the Sterling family. How could he... How could this happen?""
Arielle couldn't be more certain now. The scene before her was achingly familiar, etched into her memory. This was five years ago, on the very day she and Alexander got their marriage license.
I didn't die in that crash. I've somehow gone back... back to five years ago.
With that realization, a rush of relief and emotion swept over Arielle as she scooped her daughter into her arms. At two years old, Ruthy Sterling was small but plump, her healthy weight making her a bit heavy to hold.
Ruthy nestled her head against Arielle's neck, her voice soft and sweet as she whispered, ""Mommy... don't be scared."" She was always so gentle and comforting.
When Arielle felt her daughter tremble in her arms, her eyes stung with emotion. She quickly softened her voice, soothing her. ""It's okay, sweetheart. You don't have to be scared. I'm right here.""
In her previous life, Arielle had come to Los Angeles on a post-graduation trip, letting loose with friends. A drunken night at a bar led to a one-night stand. When she found out she was pregnant, she decided to keep the baby and move on, not caring about the man's name or how unimpressive he had been that night.
Arielle never imagined that Los Angeles' media would dig up the story. Three years later, reporters swarmed her home, cameras flashing and questions flying.
That was when she learned the man from that night was Alexander Sterling, the current head of the Sterling family.
But thanks to all the gossip and public pressure, they eventually did a paternity test. Once the results were out, William declared that Ruthy would be recognized as part of the Sterling family, and Arielle and Alexander were to be married.
On this day in her previous life, Arielle had stepped into Sterling Manor for the first time, feeling an inexplicable weight pressing down on her. She had been overwhelmed and timid, shrinking under Margaret's venomous words and the Sterling family's disdainful glares.
Back then, she hadn't scooped Ruthy into her arms like she did now. She hadn't noticed her daughter trembling with fear.
Faced with a room full of Sterlings who clearly didn't want them there, how could a two-year-old not be terrified?
In her past life, Arielle had failed her daughter. She had been too consumed by her own fear, too paralyzed to notice Ruthy's needs.
Snapping back to the present, Arielle tightened her hold, pulling her daughter closer to give her a sense of safety.
In the main hall, William sat at the head of the room, flanked by Alexander's parents and, to one side, his aunt, Victoria Sterling.
William only had one son and one daughter, and since Alexander was the eldest and Ruthy was his first grandchild, their marriage was the family's main concern. When it came to decisions about Alexander's marriage, the younger siblings and cousins didn't get a vote.
In her previous life, Arielle had spent five years in Sterling Manor, cleaning up plenty of Margaret's messes. She knew the family inside and out‚Äîtheir temperaments, their grudges, and, of course, their secrets.
Glancing across the room at Victoria, who was sitting in one of the carved wooden chairs, Arielle arched an eyebrow. She honestly couldn't remember what Victoria had said during this family meeting in her previous life.
But if she had to guess, Victoria probably wouldn't miss a single chance to take a jab at her big brother and his wife.
Sure enough, Victoria shot Arielle a sidelong look, grinning from ear to ear. ""Come on, Margaret, you've got nothing to complain about. Ms. Mitchell is a real beauty, and she doesn't even mind that your son is about as warm as a block of ice‚Äî""
Margaret cut her off fiercely, ""Shut the hell up! What on earth are you babbling about?""
Unfazed by the interruption, Victoria seemed to relish Margaret's irritation. She barely spared a glance at Margaret's spineless husband sitting nearby, her contempt for him clear.
After a brief pause, Victoria pressed on, her words laced with mockery. ""Nonsense? Oh, please. You're the lucky one here, Margaret. Your eldest son got a fianc√©e now, and a granddaughter to boot. No more bachelor days for him.""
Arielle nearly laughed out loud, thinking how Victoria's sharp tongue never missed its mark.
Margaret, completely losing her patience, snapped, ""Victoria! I don't need another granddaughter, and I certainly don't need you congratulating me!""
To be fair, Margaret did have a point. Even though her oldest son, Alexander, was unmarried at thirty, his younger brothers had all married young and had kids of their own.
Her second son, and even the third, who wasn't born into the family but brought in later, both had children. To her, Ruthy was no prize. All she wanted was to drive Arielle and her daughter out.
Fuming, Margaret pointed toward the grand entrance and shouted at Victoria, ""Get out! Our family business is none of your concern!""
Now truly annoyed, Victoria pointed right at Margaret and snapped, ""Oh, really now? That's rich. So, I'm not even part of the Sterling family now, huh? I've put up with you out of respect for Alexander, but you're really acting like you run the show, aren't you?""
Margaret and Victoria had been at each other's throats for years, and Arielle had seen this fight coming from a mile away. She tuned them out, lifting Ruthy into her arms and heading outside.
A child shouldn't be stuck in a room full of shouting adults. Let them tear into each other. In her past life, Arielle had claimed the role of Alexander's wife, and this time, she wasn't letting it slip through her fingers.
Remembering that Alexander would one day dominate the business world, rich and influential beyond belief, Arielle only became more resolute. She was set on having Ruthy legally recognized as a Los Angeles resident and formally documented as part of the Sterling family, with Alexander as her legal guardian.
In Los Angeles, among elite families, the most convincing proof of lineage was the family's official record, certified by professional institutions, akin to a legal birth certificate.
Arielle was determined that Ruthy would be the first in line to inherit from Alexander. She wasn't ashamed to admit she craved the good life. Her once quiet world was now a circus thanks to the tabloids, and she'd be crazy not to go after everything on offer.
When Arielle took Ruthy out to the garden to play, Ruthy was reluctant at first, refusing to leave her mother's arms and just clinging to her. But as the minutes passed by and she started to relax, the butterflies in the garden caught her eye, and she took off after them, giggling as she tried to catch one.
Arielle settled onto a bench, watching Ruthy scamper after the butterflies with wobbly steps. ""Slow down, sweetheart. Don't fall.""
Meanwhile, Alexander, who had just gotten a call from William to come home, was making his way over, walking steadily toward them along the garden path that led straight to the main house.
He was dressed impeccably in a tailored suit, his hair slicked back without a strand out of place, his sharp features framed by a high forehead. His piercing eyes and chiseled nose gave him an air of cold, untouchable elegance, but his expression was so stern it dulled the charm of his handsome face, like a sculpture left unfinished.
Arielle leaned back on the bench, watching him draw closer. When he was near, she waved to Ruthy, who was still chasing butterflies, and called out in a warm, honeyed tone, ""Ruthy, come here, sweetie. Say hi to your daddy.""
 
}}}###Chapter 2 Swarmed by the Reporters###{{{
Hearing her mother's call, Ruthy forgot all about the butterflies. With a grin showing off a few tiny, pearly teeth, she toddled eagerly into Arielle's arms.
She tilted her head back, eyeing the tall, unfamiliar man behind the bench. Her small face scrunched with confusion and a hint of fear.
This man was so tall, much bigger than her mom or grandma, and he didn't smile at her, just like the people inside the house. He looked stern and scary, and she didn't like him one bit.
Arielle lifted Ruthy into her arms, bouncing her gently with a warm smile. ""Come on, Ruthy, say hi to Daddy. He's your dad.""
Ruthy giggled, her laughter bright and infectious. She glanced at the tall figure still standing behind her mom. She didn't understand what ""Daddy"" really meant. It was just a word to her like any other name.
So, she thought if her mom wanted her to say it, she would be a polite little girl and do it.
With a wide, toothy grin, Ruthy tried to say ""Da... daddy,"" though she didn't quite pronounce it right.
But the man she called ""Daddy"" didn't respond. Worst yet, he didn't even look at her or crack a smile.
Ruthy's big, round eyes blinked up at Alexander, watching him expectantly. Her lips quivered, and she buried her face in Arielle's neck.
She didn't like it here one bit. All she wanted was to go back home and to be with her grandma again. Her grandma would give her sweets and always had a warm smile.
Alexander glanced at the soft, round-faced girl clinging to Arielle, and the clear sound of ""Daddy"" made something strange stir inside him. Still, he forced the feeling down and slipped back behind his frosty exterior.
He knew the child was innocent, but everything Arielle had done to trap him left a sour taste in his mouth. He turned away without another glance, determined not to look at her again.
It wasn't long before he heard Ruthy grumbling behind him, her voice tiny and indignant. ""He ignored me! He's mean. They're all mean!""
""Oh, no, sweetheart,"" Arielle said, hugging her with a gentle smile. Her words were soft and sweet, but the meaning caught everyone off guard. ""Daddy can't talk. You're a good girl, so you'll be patient with him, right?""
Ruthy's eyes lit up with curiosity. ""Is he like the people on TV who just go, 'ah ah ah'?"" She lifted her hand to her mouth and made silly ""ah-woo ah-woo"" sounds.
Arielle burst out laughing, nodding enthusiastically. ""Exactly!""
Hearing Arielle say that Alexander couldn't answer his own daughter because he was mute, David Parker, Alexander's assistant, walking just behind him, was so shocked he tripped over his own feet and nearly fell.
Alexander shot David a cold glance, his eyes briefly flickering toward the mother and daughter on the bench, now chatting about something else. Without a word, he strode toward the main hall of the manor.
David kept his head down, following closely, his focus fixed on his steps to avoid another stumble. The woman poised to become the future Mrs. Sterling had a knack for dropping bombshells, and he didn't dare dwell on her words.
Not long after Alexander entered the hall, Margaret's furious shrieks and wails echoed out.
The sound carried on the autumn breeze to the garden, where Arielle let out a soft scoff. In her past life, Margaret never stopped criticizing her for her modest background, calling her unrefined and unworthy of the Sterling name. Yet Margaret herself was the one so easily provoked, quick to throw tantrums like a spoiled socialite.
In the pleasant glow of the autumn afternoon, the garden basked in soft sunlight. Arielle led Ruthy around, pointing out the vibrant flowers.
Roses and chrysanthemums bloomed in a riot of color, their reds and purples stealing the show, framed perfectly by lush green leaves. Ruthy, like any child, was drawn to the bright hues, and Arielle was happy to indulge her, guiding her through the garden's beauty.
Arielle thought that if this life went the same as the last, it wouldn't be long before the whole garden was torn up because Victoria developed a pollen allergy. When that day came, the house would be in for another storm.
As the minutes passed, footsteps sounded once more on the garden's main path. Arielle bent over to help Ruthy walk along, and when she glanced up, she spotted Alexander. He had come back looking even more closed-off than before, his face practically thunderous.
""Let's go,"" he said, his deep eyes locking onto hers, his words clipped as if speaking to her at all was a chore.
Arielle knew this meant William had won the argument in the hall, his authority settling the matter‚Äîshe and Alexander were to get their marriage license.
She bent down and, using both hands, finally managed to pick Ruthy up. The little girl was so heavy these days. Her grandmother had been spoiling her with treats nonstop.
When Alexander saw Arielle approach with Ruthy in her arms, his eyes narrowed with unmasked skepticism. He didn't approve of bringing the child along. After all, the scandal had already spread through the city, and reporters were sure to be camped out at the marriage registry.
Just as he opened his mouth to object, a voice interrupted from the left side of the garden. ""Hello, Alexander. Oh, you're here too, Ms. Mitchell.""
A woman was walking toward them, her belly round and clearly six months pregnant. Beside her, she held the hand of a little boy, who looked about three or four.
With a warm, gracious smile, she said, ""If you and Ms. Mitchell have somewhere to be, you can leave the little one with me, Alexander. Bobbie would love to keep her company.""
Arielle held Ruthy close and turned toward the voice, the scene unfolding almost exactly as it had in her past life. There, on the same garden path, they had crossed paths with Nicole Baker, Alexander's brother's wife, her baby bump obvious as she walked from the manor.
In her past life, Alexander had insisted Ruthy shouldn't come along, so Arielle had entrusted her to Nicole, who seemed polished and kind. But Nicole's son, Bobbie Sterling, turned out to be a little terror who loved picking on others.
When Arielle had returned from getting the marriage license, she found Ruthy sobbing, her tiny palms scraped and raw from being pushed to the ground.
This time around, Arielle wasn't about to make the same mistake. She offered a gentle smile and declined. ""Thanks, but I can't leave Ruthy."" It wasn't that Ruthy couldn't be without her. She couldn't bear to be without her daughter.
Alexander's brow furrowed slightly. This woman had a way of speaking, soft and sweet, that somehow always carried a sting.
Nicole fell silent, her smile fading. She had extended an olive branch, and Arielle had the nerve to brush it off. Did this small-town nobody lack even basic social graces?
Alexander glanced at Arielle, his voice cold. ""The media will be waiting. It's not good for the child to be seen.""
""Ruthy is a very good girl. She'll stay in the car and won't wander,"" Arielle replied firmly, already heading toward the manor's gates with Ruthy in her arms. She tossed back a quick, ""Hurry then.""
The Bentley SUV glided away from the hillside estate. Ruthy nestled in Arielle's lap, peering out the window at the scenery slipping by, her face lighting up with a bright smile. ""Mommy, home!""
Arielle smiled softly, ""Not home yet, sweetheart. Your daddy and I have to take care of something."" Her voice was always warm and patient with her daughter.
She added, ""You just sit tight in the car with the driver and wait for me, okay? If you're good, I'll take you to see your grandma afterward. Sound good?""
Ruthy took a moment to process the words and then nodded eagerly, her little chins wobbling as she bobbed her head.
Arielle teased her playfully, her gaze occasionally drifting to Alexander, who sat across from them, diligently working on his laptop even in the car.
That stone-faced, mute bastard couldn't even respond when his own daughter called out for him. If Arielle didn't know from her previous life that Alexander would one day treat Ruthy well, she would have smacked him already.
By the time they arrived at the Los Angeles marriage registry, Arielle could already see a swarm of reporters gathering outside through the tinted car window. Their bodyguards rushed forward, forming a protective barrier and keeping the press at a distance.
Alexander shot Arielle a look, his disapproval of her bringing Ruthy unmistakable.
 
}}}###Chapter 3 Under the Media Spotlight###{{{
In her past life, Arielle had been terrified of Alexander at this moment. After all, a man at the pinnacle of Los Angeles' elite circles, wielding immense power with a perpetually icy demeanor, was enough to intimidate anyone.
But after five years of marriage, including three years of sharing a home and a bed, even the coldest glacier couldn't faze Arielle anymore. She had built up an immunity to his frost.
Ignoring Alexander's obvious displeasure, she leaned down to kiss Ruthy's forehead and said, ""Sweetheart, I'm getting out now. You be good and stay in the car, okay?""
Ruthy's round little head bobbed eagerly, like a determined nod.
Then, Arielle stepped out, swiftly shutting the car door behind her. The moment the reporters spotted her, camera flashes erupted like a storm, the crowd buzzing with frenzied excitement.
As bodyguards formed a protective ring around her and Alexander, guiding them forward, reporters thrust microphones and cameras into the circle, their questions firing off rapid-fire.
One shouted, ""Mr. Sterling, is the woman beside you your one-night stand?""
Another pressed. ""Are the rumors true, Mr. Sterling? Are you only getting married because of public pressure?""
A third chimed in, ""Mr. Sterling, you're basically a real-life prince and Ms. Mitchell is like Cinderella marrying into high society. What do you think about that?""
Seeing everyone bunching up and moving as a pack, the security team barked, ""Watch your step, everyone! No pushing!""
Alexander didn't respond to a single question. Arielle walked at his side, her frail frame wrapped in a tailored coffee-colored trench coat, poised and composed.
Suddenly, a microphone jabbed through the chaos, stopping inches from her lips.
The reporter's voice was sharp and cutting as he said, ""Ms. Mitchell, you schemed a pregnancy from a one-night stand and used your illegitimate daughter to strong-arm the Sterling family. This was all a calculated move to climb the social ladder, wasn't it? Please answer the question honestly.""
Suddenly, the bodyguard circle stopped in their tracks, as if the crowd had pressed too tightly to move. The reporter, seizing the moment, shoved the microphone even closer to Arielle, repeating the question with relentless determination.
At that moment, every camera turned to focus on her, and the crowd of reporters started shouting, demanding a straight answer.
When everyone came to a sudden stop, Arielle used to think it was just the crowd blocking the way. Now she realized it was this bastard Alexander, stalling on purpose so she'd have to answer that question.
Back then, it had been her first time facing such a scene. The blinding flashes left her disoriented, her eyes stinging, and the sharp question had caught her off guard.Flustered and blushing, she had stammered through a lengthy explanation, only for her words to be twisted and edited, turning her into a laughingstock in Los Angeles' gossip columns.
Arielle snapped back to the moment, her composure unshaken. In her past life, after years of managing the Sterling household, she had dealt with countless messes. So, handling sharp-tongued reporters, known for their biting questions, had become second nature.
She turned to face the reporter who had asked the question, gently lifting the slipping microphone closer to her lips. Her soft, measured voice carried clearly through the mic, amplified for all to hear.",1,1751416351.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The following examines the key features found in top-rated sonic ice makers, emphasizing their performance and impact on user experience.

**Ice Production Capacity:** This is a crucial factor to consider as it dictates how much ice the machine can produce within a 24-hour period. High-performing models can produce up to 30 pounds of sonic ice daily. The actual production rate can vary based on ambient temperature and water quality, so it's wise to consider a model with a slightly higher capacity than your anticipated needs.

**Water Reservoir Size:** The size of the water reservoir directly correlates to the ice production capacity. A larger reservoir means fewer refills, increasing convenience. Premium sonic ice makers boast reservoirs that hold between 2 to 3 gallons of water, allowing for continuous ice production over extended periods. This decreases monitoring and allows for maximum output.

**Ice Storage Capacity:** Equally vital is the ice storage bin or container, which holds the newly produced sonic ice. Many home units have a storage capacity of 2 to 3 pounds. Commercial models will provide substantially increased capacity to store up to 10 pounds of ice. Ensuring the ice maker can store enough ice will prevent overfilling and melting,thus maintaining the quality of the produced ice.

**Self-Cleaning Function:** Maintaining hygiene is vital, and self-cleaning functions streamline this process and prevent the buildup of mineral deposits and bacteria. High-end sonic ice makers include an automatic self-cleaning cycle that runs periodically, eliminating the need for manual cleaning. The cycle typically lasts 20-30 minutes, enhancing sanitation and lengthening the lifespan of the machine.

**Smart Features and Connectivity:** Modern sonic ice makers are incorporating smart technologies, enhancing user control. these features include smartphone app integration, allowing users to monitor ice production, adjust settings, and receive maintenance alerts remotely. Some models feature voice control compatibility via integration with devices like Alexa or Google Assistant.

Key features of the discussed sonic ice makers include:

* High ice production rates
* Substantial water reservoir capacity
* Adequate ice storage

Started the week confident. Environmental professional. 8 years experience. Know my stuff.

Then my boss forwards me an email: ""Quick question from the board - how does our biodiversity disclosure align with the new TNFD recommendations vs what we submitted for CSRD Article 8?""

*Freeze frame*

Cue the 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' theme music in my head. A simple question that I knew would spiral into a vortex of cross-referencing and regulatory hell.

https://preview.redd.it/e7zg0yutscaf1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=2075416241fbd4b3effe1914e043c073c722e75f

Three browser windows. 47 tabs. Four PDFs open. Two cups of cold coffee. And I'm cross-referencing frameworks like I'm the Charlie Day conspiracy meme.¬†

The worst part? This is now 60% of my job.

I got into environmental work to save the planet. Instead, I'm saving bookmarks to regulatory updates and becoming fluent in acronym soup. Don't get me wrong - ESG reporting is crucial. But when did we all become regulatory librarians?

**Real talk:** How many of you have a folder called ""ESG Frameworks 2024\_FINAL\_FINAL\_approved\_v3""?

So, after one particularly soul-crushing afternoon, I started channeling that frustration into a side project. I basically built an AI chatbot for myself and fed it all the major ESG frameworks (CSRD, GRI, SASB, TCFD, you name it). Now, instead of digging through PDFs for hours, I can just ask a question like a normal human: ""Hey, what are the key differences between SASB and GRI for a renewable energy company?"" and get a straight answer in 30 seconds. It's been my sanity-saver.

But here's what I really need to know from you all:

* Am I just shouting into the void, or are we all secretly drowning in this regulatory chaos?
* What's your worst ""I need this answer YESTERDAY"" regulatory moment that made you want to flip a desk?
* How are you currently managing it all? A bulletproof Excel sheet? Prayer?

P.S. - If anyone wants to try the AI thing I built ([Claritas ESG](https://www.claritasesg.com/)). But honestly more interested in hearing I'm not alone in this regulatory hellscape.",3,1751416191.0,Environmental_Careers,4,0.8,False

Rowling, to new writers like myself as an example of what we could accomplish. Maybe some people find that inspiring, but to me, it's like a lottery ad saying, ‚ÄúIt could be YOU.‚Äù Yes, it *could* be me‚Äîbut the chances are less than one in a million.

And no, she wasn‚Äôt just some random stay-at-home mom who decided to write a story at age 30. She had thought about the story for a long time and took her a long time to write it too. She was well-read, educated, and had been writing stories since she was a child. With *Harry Potter*, she clearly had a talent for crafting the kind of story that resonated with young people. You also can‚Äôt deny the importance of being in the right place at the right time ‚Äî and the massive marketing push, the sequels, the movies, and everything else that turned her into, what, a billionaire?

Meanwhile, much more talented and educated writers are barely making a living. How many writers do you know who earn enough to quit their day jobs? How many made a million last year? And how many made hundreds of millions like J.K. Rowling or Stephen King? The truth is, some writers who *could have* been the next Shakespeare have been waiting tables or taking coffee orders for years.

Yes, I‚Äîand many other new writers‚Äî*could* get lucky. But dedicating yourself to writing solely with the hope of ‚Äúmaking it big‚Äù is naive and, frankly, irresponsible. Write because you love it‚Äînever because you think it will make you rich. Because success in writing is not something you can control.

If you want a stable, well-paying career and a predictable lifestyle, become a doctor, a lawyer, or follow some other well-worn path. Those professions offer structure and a clearer path to success. Most creative pursuits aren‚Äôt like that. They carry far more risk.

You can‚Äôt walk around with your head in the clouds‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to keep your feet on the ground. And it doesn't help when other people think writing is easy or getting lucky is a sufficient reason to encourage someone to write or keep writing.

I was nervous but excited, since the reviews were mixed but our room (Honeymoon Two-Story Beachfront Rooftop Pool - or some long name similar to that) seemed awesome. Our overall impression was ‚ÄúWow this is better than we expected!‚Äù for every aspect! We may come back to this exact resort, but we are more likely to visit another Excellence collection resort in a new place because we had a very good experience with this brand overall. 

Pros: amazing room amenities. We used the in-suite hot tub and personal rooftop pool every single day! We also thought it was very clean. Based on other Reddit reviews, we brought a DampRid bag in case it was humid, but it didn‚Äôt really fill up w/ water, and we didn‚Äôt notice bad humidity in our room. Delicious food - we liked every restaurant and room service! We knew we were at an all inclusive so the food could be hit or miss, but we enjoyed everything. We live in a big city and trying restaurants is one of our favorite hobbies - everything from hot dog stands to Michelin Star restaurants, and we genuinely liked each place we tried at El Carmen! Manage your expectations with the breakfast buffet, but it had sooo many options, so there‚Äôs something for everyone. Special mention to the onsite coffee shop. I absolutely loved the alcoholic coffees, and it was such a cute environment. Overall alcohol‚Ä¶ pretty good drinks - some language barrier (we don‚Äôt speak any spanish) and not every bar had items to make my fave drink, dirty martini, but all the drinks were strong and pretty tasty. The beach server and Sports Bar bartender (where we often went for a drink before dinner) remembered us and our orders each day. No complaints there! Free/included spa experience - ‚Äúhydrotherapy‚Äù - super funny and fun and came w/ a head and shoulders massage! An unexpected and better-than-expected hour long experience that was a great way to start one of our days. Transportation, included w/ our booking: super easy, private, nice SUVs. Loved that it was just us two and not a hot, smelly bus full of people. They were also very responsive, even when our flight to the DR got delayed! Also, a lot of reviews mentioned the staff at the resort forcing you to write reviews‚Ä¶ we hung out at the beach and main pool a lot, visited a different restaurant for every lunch/dinner, drank at almost every bar, did the spa, and got room service several times and not one person asked us for a review!! 

Neutral: Excellence Club. It came with the room we picked which was fine, but we only ate at the club restaurant once for dinner because we preferred to spend our time outside during the days and didn‚Äôt want a long breakfast meal. We also didn‚Äôt drink at the club bar very much, again because it was inside and was further away from the beach and our own private pool. Plus, our room had full fifths of liquor and unlimited mixers (and they sent us another fifth of vodka mid-week when we requested it on a note to room service while we were at the beach!), so we didn‚Äôt feel the need to go inside to a special bar. Also, the ‚Äúprivate club‚Äù beach + bars aren‚Äôt monitored to our knowledge, and they weren‚Äôt any different than the ‚Äúregular‚Äù beach. The Excellence Club check in was nice because, when we said it was our honeymoon, she gave us a free beach dinner ($250 value!) which was fun, romantic, and tasty. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt ADD on the Excellence Club if it‚Äôs not a part of your room, but our actual room amenities were our favorite part and the Excellence Club was a neutral addition. Beach vendors: I‚Äôm not sure if the resort itself is technically a ‚Äúprivate beach‚Äù or not, but vendors wearing polos w/ their vendor numbers walk up and down the beach. Once we said ‚Äúno gracias,‚Äù they left us alone. It didn‚Äôt bother us really at all, and we were on a beach getting unlimited drinks! The seaweed/sargassum‚Ä¶ eh. I knew coming in that this was ‚Äúa big problem‚Äù but my husband didn‚Äôt. The first several days, they had machinery cleaning it up. This didn‚Äôt bother us at all bc my husband loves construction machinery and is a construction litigation attorney so it kept him entertained. I could see how the noise would bother other people, if you don‚Äôt like tractors/other machinery rumbling by. They didn‚Äôt clean the Excellence Club beach sooner/faster than the regular beach - there was no difference. The smell was totally fine and didn‚Äôt bother us the first few days, but our last two days there it was too much so we didn‚Äôt go into the water. We swam in the ocean 4/6 days, and that was fine with us. We personally aren‚Äôt picky or ‚Äútough customers,‚Äù but I could see how the seaweed + beach vendors could ruin someone else‚Äôs day if you are expecting PERFECTLY clean and white beaches with no one talking to you. Managing your own expectations helps! 

Cons: the bathroom in the room ugh. It was basically just a stall door next to the shower, and we really prefer our individual privacy for the restroom. Not very private at all! ‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt really think of anything else I would truly consider a con!!! 

Reading reviews before we went was a helpful and harmful experience for me (but helped me manage my expectations loll!!), so pls comment any q‚Äôs you have, if you‚Äôre curious about anything I mentioned or didn‚Äôt mention. ",5,1751415937.0,PuntaCana,0,1.0,False

i will be making enough per year that even with the bridge toll, money shouldn't really be an issue either way. however, i just wonder if this really would be worth it. i worry about the commute being annoying and taking up a lot of my time, and/or wear and tear on my car from said commute that would eat up even more money. i love being outdoors and hiking and all that marin has to offer, but i really value having access to the city, having an active social life, dating, and easy access to new coffee shops and restaurants. i worry a lot about both options - i will feel stupid if i end up spending all my time in marin anyway, and even stupider if i had the option to be in the city and picked the sleepy place that already gave me a bad vibe.",3,1751415589.0,Marin,21,0.8,False

Assistant Agent in Charge, Milton Chambers, returned to the suburban coffee shop on a quiet Thursday morning. This time, he chose a small table for 2; a spot by the window, where he could watch the door as well as the counter. It suited him perfectly. Luckily, only a handful of people moved about the white and brown checkered seating area. Scents of vanilla and hazelnut hung in the air, so he ordered a steaming cup to sip while passing the time. Though most people found it boring, he enjoyed surveillancing people. He even liked making them squirm from time to time.

¬†¬†¬†An incoming storm brewed on the horizon and many heeded its warning. Not him. Even as dark clouds settled high above, the serious gentleman turned his chair slightly to get a better view of the petite woman scurrying about. He had a feeling that she‚Äôd quickly notice.

¬†¬†¬†With coffee in hand, he stared at the high-strung woman. In black jeans and a company T-shirt containing the Brew Box logo, which consisted of an image of a brown box of coffee, she had her long hair pulled back with pink material and wore mauve lipstick on her full lips. She stayed focused on her job, giving him time to observe her without much attention. In fact, he kind of enjoyed staring at a pretty woman and not the usual bad guys.

¬†¬†¬†He thought about her as well as Scott Page, who she once knew as a boy named Henry. Together, they had been forced into some secret government program. Things get murky after that. He needed to clear that up. He knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy. Paperwork was shredded decades ago, and no one was keen to awaken old ghosts. Like her, Scott resisted remembering, though Ninon had been lured into some other Black Op program in the present time. That hampered getting to the truth, though he certainly would try. It might ruffle some feathers here and there, but he didn‚Äôt mind pressing on.¬†

It was Jan in fact who first contacted him. She gave him all the information that Scott had entrusted with her, but could no longer pursue due to pressure from above. With too many red flags, Milton saw it as his duty to give his assessment on the case. Calm and collected, he‚Äôd swoop in and decide what should be done about it before getting others involved. At the moment, it was this mysterious creature who was on his radar. And he waited for her to notice.

Going about her usual work day, Ninon placed a steaming cup of coffee on the counter for an aloof business woman with resting bitch-face and abruptly froze when she noticed the intense man in the suit sitting there, staring at her. Their gazes locked and she appeared confused. Her dark eyebrows raised and she paused as if questioning his intentions of being there. Surely he was just a customer. Wasn‚Äôt he?

¬†¬†Though she returned to her next coffee order, she peeked back. His attention interested her. To be honest, she liked being the object of his focus, which made her feel like the center of the universe; at least his.

¬†¬†Even if she didn‚Äôt know what really went through his mind, she wondered if maybe he read a sense of sadness and loneliness in her expression as well as in her movements. Maybe he found her vulnerable. Whatever it was that captivated him, his complete attention aroused her. He sat motionless, as if absorbed by her. Usually that might have alarmed her, but he had the Law Enforcement vibe, so she tried to get a sense of who he was and what he might want? He didn‚Äôt seem to be overtly trying to intimidate her. But he didn‚Äôt hide the fact that he was interested in her either.

¬†¬†Part of her wanted to run and to not get dragged into his game, but she was drawn to him like a woman to a vampire, knowing that it was dangerous, yet moaning as he slowly sucked her dry. And enjoying it. *I hope he can‚Äôt read my mind.*¬†



Milton made a few assumptions. It was as if she wanted to reach out, but didn‚Äôt know how. He made it clear to her that he was watching her, but softened his gaze. An almost tender moment passed between them, and he gave a soft smile, which seemed to confuse her even more. She slowly turned away and stared at the counter for a moment before busying herself again with her job. He felt that maybe his attention overwhelmed her somewhat and he might have been correct about that. But she seemed keen on discovering what this may be all about. He would let her mull over it.

¬†¬†¬†Most importantly, Milton didn‚Äôt find her dangerous, though he needed to approach her with caution.



Like him, Ninon had her own concerns, so she kept a look-out for him. This dark stranger came in a few other times over the next two weeks. She started looking forward to it. Finally, one day she had the nerve to speak to him. She held the coffee cup out to him and let her hand brush against his. His warmth startled her cold hand, but she made her move.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHello, Milton,‚Äù she said, pointing to his name on the cup.

¬†¬†¬†Her voice came across as soft and hesitant, but curious.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHello, Ninon,‚Äù he said back to her, making sure that he used her name to let her know that he was aware of who she was, or giving her the impression that he at least read her name tag‚Ä¶or file.

¬†¬†¬†His own voice was deep, naturally commanding, and used to a level of respect. Though appearing serious, he had a touch of concern and even a hint of humor about him, as if waiting for her next move. It was as if he was ready for the game and willing to play it, but his no-nonsense approach said that he might keep her in check.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAre you keeping tabs on me, Milton?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he assured her, ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm interested in your story.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said, a little surprised. She bit her bottom lip and added, ‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù

¬†¬†‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he admitted, leaning a little closer as if to tell her a secret. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with this coffee brand.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†Trying to suppress a smile, she remarked, ‚ÄúYes, this coffee is quite addictive. You might want to quit while you can.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúUnfortunately, I‚Äôm not a quitter.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Chapter 13





Ninon didn‚Äôt return his calls. While Milton checked her place, her door was unlocked. He knocked and walked in, unsure if he should be worried. There was no sign of her. When he glanced into her bedroom, he noticed empty drawers and sighed. He thought the worst. But at that moment, he heard floorboards creak and he drew his gun. While moving behind the bedroom door, he peeked out and saw a man in dark-colored clothes heading towards him.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot,‚Äù the muscular man with the goatee said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing what you are doing.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAnd what is that?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSeeing for myself that she made a run for it.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have anything to do with it?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúNo, and I won‚Äôt go after her,‚Äù¬† Ryder said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm erasing her file. She doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhy the change of heart?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThe FBI and the CIA found her on the same day a long time ago, and it's only fitting that we both give her a chance at a normal life.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think she is capable of that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but it is up to her now.‚Äù

The man in the dark suit said, ‚ÄúSo are you going to tell me where Deddy is now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOfficially? No.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet it go.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù Milton told him, while contemplating what to do.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs grab a beer sometime.‚Äù

With a pain in his heart, Milton nodded and followed Ryder outside of her building. They shook hands and went their separate ways, though neither quite trusted the other. And both were certain that neither of them would ever give up looking for her.



Across the street, withdrawing money from the bank, a woman in pink Converse stared out the window at the two men whom she had grown fond of and felt a tinge of sadness tightening in her chest. After thanking the clerk, the brunette put on her sunglasses and headed outside into the bright sunlight. Who knows? Maybe she‚Äôd see the men again or they‚Äôd see her. But for now, she was going to travel around the country and be a normal person for a while. But wherever she went, whether to Mount Rushmore or to the Grand Canyon, she‚Äôd leave clues behind, writing H179 on random places, just in case someone needed to find her. And perhaps, one or both of them would.¬†

¬†¬†¬†More than anything, Ninon longed to exist in the same space again with Milton, as if nothing else mattered. To never see those eyes engaged with hers again would be a painful divide that she‚Äôd never be able to overcome. So she‚Äôd be around, waiting, just in case he ever came looking. He‚Äôd want to give chase. But first, she needed any interest in her from others to die down. Things were too complicated right now. Eventually, she would be almost forgotten about, though she hoped that he at least would never forget her. And that gave her something to live for. On some future day that their paths crossed again, she‚Äôd find a man in a dark suit looking back at her and she‚Äôd smile, knowing that it was probably impossible to disappear in this technological age. And that was something that she was counting on.

Looking at me now, tell me. Will I ever be free?

Just then, a white convertible pulled up to the curb and a sexy blonde in a white blouse and skirt motioned to the stunned woman wearing the backpack, who didn‚Äôt know whether to stay put or to flee.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHop in.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAnd why would I do that, Dr. Witt?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôve earned your wings. Ryder clipped them and kept you from being all that you can be,‚Äù Evelyn Witt answered her with her often seductive, silky voice. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want them back now?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†Ninon kind of understood what she was saying. Maybe she was ready to fully be who she was, out from under his shadow and control. To be honest, she wasn‚Äôt sure what she would find hiding there. Still, she had her suspicions about this mind bender. It might be some kind of ploy. Should she trust her?

¬†¬†‚ÄúCome on. We‚Äôre both retired now,‚Äù the lovely woman said with a shrug. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go have some fun.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†With a giggle, Ninon said, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶Oh, what the hell.‚Äù

Ninon opened the car door and hopped in. It seemed Ninon Gage‚Äôs story wasn‚Äôt quite over, but that will be saved for the next adventure. Wherever she chose to go, men in suits were sure to follow. They never quite knew what to expect from her, but she had to be ready to meet their expectations no matter what they were. She might even have some of her own. And she was just getting started. They both were.

¬†¬†¬†For the time being, Ninon happily put on some 80‚Äôs music and sat back. First, she chose Camoflages‚Äôs song ‚ÄúLove is a Shield,‚Äù and they both started singing along with it as they sped off into the distance. She planned on listening to all of her favorites while they set out to an unknown destination. In a way, each song held pieces of her past and she was ready for them to unfold into new visions for the future. At the same time, she peeked into the mirror, wondering if someone was already on their tail. But it was too soon to know for sure.¬†

Until then, Ninon let the wind whip her hair behind her and she raised her arms, imagining them turning to wings. At least for this moment, she could feel free. And it felt refreshing and a long time coming into fruition. She then closed her eyes and allowed herself to believe it‚Ä¶for now.",1,1751415516.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! I work as a programmer, but i am a gamer at heart. When i am not working i like to wind down by reading a book, watching a show, going for a walk, cooking (i am a solid cook and foodie), and of course gaming (i have recently been taking a stab at my backlog which is very large tbh).

The reason i am writing this post is mainly because i do not really have friends who play games and i would like to change that. I imagine it would be nice to message a friend to do a run in Nightreign, play some cod, baldur's gate, or any other game that i'd want to play. I usually play a variety of games, mostly based on my mood (although admittedly not too much multiplayer these days which would be nice to fix).¬†**I would prefer that people age 18+ reach out, any gender is welcome.**

Some games i recently played and enjoyed: Soulsborne, First Berserker Khazan, Red Dead Redemption 2, Dave the Diver, Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, Expedition 33, Vampire Survivors, Monster Hunter Wilds, Pacman Re-Pac (nostalgic as ever), High on Life, Lies of P, Eastward, etc. I have been enjoying indie games a lot since i find the more creative and they dont take too much time when i dont have it. Feel free to leave a comment or add me. Looking forward to talking and meeting everyone!

Heeding Doctor Ukan‚Äôs warning about not bringing meat into the herbivore cafeteria, Jason decided to make that side of the room his first stop. It was already busier than it had been when they walked past earlier, but there were still only a couple of people ahead of him in line. The room was set up much like just about any other cafeteria he‚Äôd ever been in before. At the start of the line was a rack of trays and silverware, and from there were a few stations with different options available. Fruits, bread-like products, pastries, some type of oatmeal-analogue, pretty much everything one might expect to see at a breakfast buffet. Minus the bacon, eggs, and sausage, of course. Another section, presumably catered to the second or third-shift workers who wouldn‚Äôt be having breakfast now, bore a strong resemblance to a salad bar. 

Jason scanned the ID card on his watch as he picked up a tray, emulating what the others in front of him had been doing. Immediately, a hologram popped up out of the device. It was a square, about one foot by one foot in size, and at first it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything other than project a slight shimmer of light into the air. But when he looked through the hologram towards the food, each item began to emanate a colored aura. Nearly everything on the menu glowed blue, but pretty much every variety of nut was marked red. Each label was accompanied by some text that appeared at first in an alien language, but as he looked at it the symbols began to shift around and merge into a giant blur. After a few seconds, the blur resolved itself into the form of more writing, this time in English. The blue indicated items that were safe to eat, and the red items would be toxic to him.

Basing his choice on nothing in particular, Jason grabbed a toasted bread product resembling a smaller version of a bagel, a fruit similar in size and shape to a pear but purple, and a handful of things that were helpfully labeled as ‚Äòblueberries‚Äô despite having little resemblance to the Earth variant bearing the same name. The alien variant was a similar shape and size to a blackberry, but featured seeds on the outside and leaves on top like a strawberry. Not knowing which items he might like and which ones he wouldn‚Äôt, he decided he‚Äôd be better off grabbing a little bit of everything. At least until he‚Äôd gotten a chance to try everything the cafeteria had to offer. 

The hologram from Jason‚Äôs watch was slightly more helpful when it came to drinks, this time offering a brief description of each menu option rather than just a name and whether or not it was safe for Human consumption. He selected the one whose description was most similar to coffee, and the dispenser filled his glass with a watermelon-red liquid that smelled vaguely sweet. From there, he decided to check out the carnivorous options. On this side of the cafeteria, he was able to eat everything on the menu. Thankfully, it seemed like bacon and eggs, or at least some variant thereof, were universal.

Once Jason finished filling up his tray, he went out into the main seating area. There were maybe two dozen people already there, with at least that many more beginning to line up on both sides of the cafeteria. Not seeing any open seats at any of the currently-occupied tables, he decided to grab his own table over by the window. 

Although his first time seeing outer space in person wasn‚Äôt quite happening the way Jason had hoped, it was still his first time seeing outer space in person. He knew before he even looked out the window that he‚Äôd remember this moment for the rest of his life. A lifetime of sci-fi movies had convinced him that faster-than-light travel would be accompanied by some sort of swirling blue tunnel effect, but it looked more like a still image of a starry background than anything else. If he picked out one of the brighter and larger - and presumably, therefore, closer - stars and stared at that one in particular, he could tell that it was very slowly making its way across his field of view. But there was nothing else to indicate that the ship was in motion at all. 

He couldn‚Äôt help but wonder which one of those stars outside might be home. Doctor Ukan had said something about interstellar flights taking weeks or even months, which did leave him hopeful that Earth might not be too far away. At least on a galactic scale. At that speed, it would‚Äôve taken a while to get very far. But when he remembered what else she‚Äôd said, that he could have been frozen in stasis for centuries before they picked him up, he wondered how close he really was. Maybe it really had only been a few days. Maybe that bright star he was looking at now really was the Sun. Or maybe he was on the far side of the galaxy by now, having spent a lifetime in stasis. The fact that Humanity hadn‚Äôt yet arrived on the galactic scene gave him some hope that he hadn‚Äôt been frozen for too long, but he had to admit to himself that he had no proof of that either way. For his own sanity, he had to assume the former.

The one saving grace for the whole situation was that Ukan had said that they‚Äôd give him a ride home if they knew where to take him. Jason wasn‚Äôt much of an astronomer himself, but how hard could it be to find Earth on a map? Just pull up the alien equivalent of Google, type in ‚Äòsolar systems with 9 planets near me‚Äô, and start looking. If by some miracle it really was that easy, he was confident that he‚Äôd at least recognize pictures of the planets in his home solar system if the alien internet had any for him to find. With any luck, he‚Äôd be back home in no time.

By the time a pair of aliens wandered over to Jason‚Äôs table a few minutes later, he‚Äôd barely touched his breakfast. One of the aliens was maybe five or six inches shorter than him and somewhat resembled a bat, albeit with wings that looked more vestigial than functional, and the other was even smaller and squirrel-like. They had a long torso, short limbs, a gray-black fur pattern, and a long, thick, bushy tail. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the new guy, right?‚Äù the bat-alien asked, Jason‚Äôs translator choosing a male voice. ‚ÄúCan we join you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Jason replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jason.‚Äù By force of habit, he set his fork down and reached for a handshake, but evidently the gesture was not universal.

‚ÄúFarranax,‚Äù the bat-alien introduced himself, setting his tray down across from Jason before extending his wings to display a purple striped pattern across the membranes. 

‚ÄúHjelin,‚Äù the squirrel-alien said as she took the seat next to Farranax, the translator rendering her words in a female voice. 

As soon as he heard their names, something clicked in Jason‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúDoctor Ukan told me about you. You got here the same way I did, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù Farranax confirmed. 

Jason remembered that Ukan had also mentioned another name. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Oyre?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably just getting into bed about now,‚Äù Hjelin replied. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs second shift. But trust me, you don‚Äôt really want to talk to her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Jason asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a bit ‚Ä¶‚Äù Farranax began, before Hjelin interrupted.

‚ÄúCrazy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go that far,‚Äù Farranax said. ‚ÄúBut she has some, uh, *interesting* ideas about the universe. If she starts telling you about that, best to just smile and nod.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll keep that in mind,‚Äù Jason replied. His own younger brother, Troy, was the same. They‚Äôd hardly spoken at all over the last few years, and every conversation they did have inevitably devolved into an argument about 5G microchips, or chemtrails, or stolen elections, or whatever the latest buzzword in the world of conspiracy theories happened to be. He wasn‚Äôt too keen on having any more arguments like that. 

‚ÄúHave you decided if you‚Äôre staying on board?‚Äù Hjelin asked.

In all honesty, Jason didn‚Äôt want to stay. He‚Äôd much rather go home, given the chance. But that didn‚Äôt seem like an option, at least for now. ‚ÄúI hope so,‚Äù Jason said. It was really the only thing he felt like he could do, given the circumstances. Take the job that comes with food and housing, or get abandoned on an alien planet billions of miles from home with nothing but the clothes on his back. When he thought of it in those terms, it was an easy choice. ‚ÄúOnce the shift starts, I‚Äôm going to talk to Lakim in engineering. I was a mechanic back home.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMechanic, huh?‚Äù Farranax commented. ‚ÄúThat must put your homeworld at, what, stage four?‚Äù

Jason shrugged. ‚ÄúDunno. We have computers and stuff like that, we‚Äôve explored most of our solar system with probes, but we‚Äôve never sent a person beyond our own moon.‚Äù

‚ÄúStage five, then,‚Äù Hjelin said. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre the first stage five we‚Äôve picked up. Even Oyre is only stage four.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both from stage three worlds,‚Äù Farranax added. ‚ÄúMost of the people who end up abandoned out here are from stage zero, one, or two. Too primitive to be able to join the crew.‚Äù

Although Jason understood the general idea of what they were saying, he felt like he was missing some context. Both of them referred to the stages merely by their number, as if that alone was enough information for him to understand exactly what they meant. He made a mental note to look it up in the ship‚Äôs computers after his shift. Instead of revealing his ignorance, he asked, ‚ÄúWhat happens to them?‚Äù

‚ÄúDropped off at our next stop,‚Äù Hjelin said.

‚ÄúYeah, the doctor told me,‚Äù Jason replied. ‚ÄúI meant after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Alliance takes them in,‚Äù Farranax said. ‚ÄúThey get enough government assistance to get by. To learn how to make themselves useful out here. They‚Äôre not going to be as well-off as someone born into the Alliance, but they‚Äôre taken care of.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlanning on leaving?‚Äù Hjelin asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jason replied. ‚ÄúJust curious.‚Äù In truth, he was a bit worried about his ability to actually be a mechanic on the ship. He was confident that he could handle anything with nuts, bolts, and screws no problem, but if Lakim wanted him to diagnose a fault in an alien computer, he might run into some trouble. He hadn‚Äôt been great at that kind of stuff back home to start with, and the fact that he would now be working with alien technology hundreds of years more advanced than anything he‚Äôd ever seen before couldn‚Äôt help matters. He wondered how much of a chance he‚Äôd be given to learn before they kicked him off the ship. 

Farranax glanced at the clock on the wall behind Jason as he finished up his meal and then said, ‚ÄúWe should probably get to work now. We‚Äôre meeting up with a few friends in lounge seven after dinner if you want to join us.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Jason agreed as they got up from the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you then.‚Äù

Jason returned his tray and took the stairs down to the bottom level of the ship where he‚Äôd seen the engine room on the tour. A tall, muscular cat-alien with jet-black fur was waiting for him outside. ‚ÄúJason?‚Äù the alien asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jason nodded.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lakim. Doctor Ukan says you‚Äôre a mechanic, but I assume you‚Äôve never worked on a ship before.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt,‚Äù Jason confirmed. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve been working on cars for about ten years.‚Äù He tried to retrieve his phone and show off some pictures of a classic restoration he‚Äôd done for a customer recently, but his pockets were empty. 

‚ÄúGood enough,‚Äù Lakim said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been short-staffed for a while now. We‚Äôre starting to fall behind on routine maintenance, and we took some damage in a pirate attack not too long ago. If you can turn a wrench, I could use your help.‚Äù

Lakim scanned his watch and opened the door to the engine room, then scanned it again on the other side. ‚ÄúThis is the time clock,‚Äù he said as he pointed out the second scanner. ‚ÄúScan in when you start your shift, scan out when you‚Äôre done.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jason said as he did the same. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre scheduled for four days on, two days off,‚Äù Lakim said once Jason was clocked in. ‚ÄúBut really, ‚Äòoff‚Äô just means ‚Äònothing scheduled‚Äô. We usually do get the time off more often than not, but not all repairs can wait for your next scheduled shift.‚Äù 

Jason supposed that made sense. If the life support system or something like that broke down mid-flight, it didn‚Äôt matter what day of the week it was. It had to be fixed. 

Lakim retrieved a toolbox from a shelf near the door and said, ‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He led Jason back out of the engine room and towards the nearest of the cargo bay doors. He typed something into the interface on his watch and then scanned it, opening the door.

‚ÄúI thought Doctor Ukan said those stay locked while we‚Äôre in flight,‚Äù Jason mused.

‚ÄúNormally they do,‚Äù Lakim agreed. ‚ÄúBut the lifters in there are due for service. You can unlock it if you have a work order.‚Äù

Jason followed Lakim down the stairs into the cargo bay, and the engineer opened a closet along the wall next to the base of the staircase. When Jason looked inside, he saw two contraptions that looked like a gray Iron Man suit with a built-in forklift attached to the front of it. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got two of these in each cargo bay,‚Äù Lakim explained. ‚ÄúWe use ‚Äòem to hand the cargo off to the crew at the docks.‚Äù He pressed a button on the back of one of the lifters, revealing a hidden compartment inside the suit, then tapped his watch to the backside of the panel that had popped open. ‚ÄúStart out by running a diagnostic and checking for trouble codes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis should only take a minute. In the meantime, we‚Äôll need this next,‚Äù he added, retrieving a pair of hoses from the wall behind the lifter.

Lakim‚Äôs watch chimed and opened up a hologram, this one displaying a list of the components making up the lifter. Each one was marked blue, except for the red-marked ‚Äòhydraulic fluid‚Äô near the top of the list. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBlue is within spec, red means it needs work. All of the lifters are due for fresh fluid anyway, so this is exactly what I was expecting to see.‚Äù

Lakim opened the toolbox and retrieved a wrench, then loosened a plug inside the service panel. Jason was relieved to see that it loosened in the same direction as what he was used to. Had they done it backwards, he knew it probably would have taken a lifetime to get used to it. Lakim grabbed the red-marked hose and fastened it to the place the plug had come out of. ‚ÄúThese new models drain through the hose, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about trying to deal with the old fluid.‚Äù 

Jason could see the convenience of the design, and he was kind of jealous that he‚Äôd never had tools like this back home. Lakim flipped a switch next to the hose on the wall, and Jason could hear a faint whirring as the pump at the other end of the hose engaged. The hose itself was made of a translucent material, so he could see the old fluid as it was sucked out of the lifter. Once it ran dry, Lakim flipped the switch again, then disconnected the red-marked hose and replaced it with the blue-marked one next to it. Once the blue hose was secure in the back of the lifter, Lakim flipped the switch for that hose and began to pump fresh hydraulic fluid into the system. Once that was done, he disconnected the hose, replaced the plug, scanned his watch again, then closed the access panel. 

‚ÄúGot all that?‚Äù Lakim asked once the whole process was done.

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù Jason replied. 

‚ÄúGood. Now do the other one,‚Äù Lakim said.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jason agreed, and he repeated the whole process Lakim had just demonstrated on the cargo bay‚Äôs other lifter. It took him a couple of minutes longer than it had taken Lakim, but he finished the job with no trouble at all. 

Lakim took a moment to inspect the work once Jason had finished, and when he decided it had been done properly he handed the toolbox over to Jason. ‚ÄúGood work. Now do the rest of the lifters in the other cargo bays. If any of them have any codes about anything other than hydraulic fluid, let me know but don‚Äôt try to fix it yourself. Come find me in the engine room when you‚Äôre done.‚Äù

The work wasn‚Äôt as hard as Jason had been expecting for his first attempt to service alien technology, but it was time-consuming. He wasn‚Äôt sure on the specs for fluid capacity, but the pump system seemed to know when to shut itself off. It took about five minutes to drain each lifter suit, then five more minutes to refill it. Annoyingly, the system wasn‚Äôt set up to allow him to service both of a cargo bay‚Äôs lifters at the same time. He was only able to scan into the next one after he had finished working on the previous one. But there were some upsides, too. The pump mechanism used to drain and refill the lifters meant that there was no cleanup required afterwards and no old fluid to dispose of. And, unlike certain newer cars he had worked on back home, these things were actually designed to be serviced. By the time he had finished all twelve of the remaining lifters - one pair for each cargo bay - nearly half of his shift was gone. 

When Jason returned to the engine room, he found Lakim in the middle of tearing down something that looked important. It was a black metal box, about the size and shape of a filing cabinet, and from what he could see the interior was a mess of hoses and wires. The sound of the door closing behind Jason got Lakim‚Äôs attention, and the alien asked, ‚ÄúAny trouble with the lifters?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jason replied. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve all got fresh fluid and no codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Lakim said. ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre here, I might as well show you this,‚Äù he added, gesturing to the box he was working on. ‚ÄúThis is the control unit for one of our five primary drives. They‚Äôve all been running a bit rough since the pirate attack, and they‚Äôll all need to be rebuilt soon. Technically a ship this size only really needs three in order to run, but it‚Äôs always good to have backups. Besides, more drives means more speed.‚Äù He handed Jason a book and said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the service manual. Take a look at it and try to follow along with what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jason said as he began to flip through the book. 

For the rest of Jason‚Äôs shift, he watched while Lakim disassembled the drive unit, the more experienced ship mechanic pausing periodically to quiz him on various components as he removed them. A few times, Jason was asked to help hold something in place when Lakim got to one of those annoying parts designed to require three hands to remove, but for the most part he was just an observer. And the more he saw, the more he felt like this was a job he could actually do given the chance to learn.",8,1751415287.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm an expat arriving in Tallinn to work for Wise. I‚Äôm expected to arrive on August, with wife and a cat. 

I have been reading some posts about people using rendin, people paying deposits, bad tenants, bad landlords and started to get worried about it.

What should I be aware about renting in Tallinn ? How can I avoid being in trouble or notice bad landlord that just want to take my money ? 

I have already rented apartments where I live and I consider myself a good tenant, never had a trouble with renting or finishing a rent, and landlords here usually do not try mocking people. 

Also, what regions would you recommend to live ? I‚Äôm pretty young (26) and like nature, coffees, gaming and walks. I was searching something nearby my office, but I‚Äôm not sure. 

Looking forward to be in Tallinn!

I got up for work around 7:30, said hi and good morning to him,  he would not even look at me or acknowledge me. I was just like ‚Äúoookay‚Äù and went about my morning routine, feeling confused and slightly anxious. Fed the dogs, made my coffee etc. He showered and left for work without saying goodbye. I texted him to say ‚Äúhave a nice day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and he responded ‚Äúyou too‚Äù. I asked if everything was ok, and he said ‚Äúyes‚Äù. He never is short with me unless something is wrong, but my therapist has worked with me to stop there and self regulate and not try to read his mind or get it out of him to talk to me in a healthy way because that‚Äôs his responsibility. 

Finally I get home from work, and he eventually tells me he was upset that I was ‚Äúso mean to him‚Äù last night and that I put all the dishes away so loudly and in the wrong places??? I was so confused. I do remember being slightly annoyed and snippy because it was late and I was emptying the dishwasher and doing the dishes again at 10:30pm so neither of us had to worry about it in the morning while packing lunch for the next day at work. I even intentionally put on calming music and lit a candle to regulate myself. I put everything where I normally put it so no clue on that one‚Ä¶

I guess cold shoulder for less than a day isn‚Äôt that bad but I just find this so exhausting.

1lphrzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1lphrzt/1_month_in_ecuador/,1 month in Ecuador,"We visited Ecuador as part of our 3 year around the world trip (currently on month 11 and 11th country). Most people associate Ecuador with the Gal√°pagos Islands. For budget reasons, we went almost everywhere *except* there this time ‚Äî we‚Äôll come back specifically for them and give them the special attention they deserve in the future. The continental part of Ecuador has *so much* to offer for all lovers of nature, hiking, and exotic vibes mixed with modern comfort.

Crossing from the Peru-Ecuador border felt like travelling 15‚Äì20 years into the future. Almost every small town here could outshine the big Peruvian cities in terms of organization, cleanliness, and convenience. The people are kinder and don‚Äôt see many tourists, and even though prices are in dollars, everyday costs are much more affordable. It is also way quieter in terms of traffic, honking and music, but still it's LATAM - it's difficult to escape from the dogs, roosters and the cumbia.

In the very south, around Vilcabamba and Loja, is Ecuador‚Äôs coffee region, where we spent nearly a week hopping between different fincas and trying all kinds of first-class coffee. Unfortunately, outside Europe, espresso isn‚Äôt really a thing, and the best varieties are offered only as filter coffee (this applies to every country we‚Äôve visited so far). We got tired of it, so we bought our own grinder and a portable espresso machine (Picopresso). Things are now easier and happier for everyone involved.

Ecuador also produces the highest-quality cacao in the world, and in every town you‚Äôll find countless brand-name chocolate shops ‚Äî each better than the last. We stocked up with over a kilo of chocolate: we‚Äôve got ones with green olives, juniper, salt, raw cacao, passionfruit, allspice, rose, 100% pure bars, and who knows what else. The flavor combos are endless ‚Äî only your imagination is the limit.

But the most amazing thing here is the *biodiversity* ‚Äî just walking around each day, you see 5‚Äì10 new species of birds and butterflies, not to mention the plants. In Mindo, we even rented a private hacienda with its own jungle ‚Äî a few acres you could freely roam and watch the birds go by undirsturbed. We managed to snap a photo of the famous toucan, as well as several incredibly interesting butterflies ‚Äî including the caligo butterfly.

If you Google it now, it‚Äôll say Ecuador is a dangerous country to visit (Level 3). That‚Äôs because of drug trafficking issues along the coast, but inland there's absolutely no trouble. At every turn we‚Äôre met with kindness and politeness, and people are always ready to help if you need anything. Like in any LATAM country, without Spanish you‚Äôre not getting far ‚Äî but after 5 months on the continent, we‚Äôre at around B1 level and nothing is stopping us now.

The route was: Vilcabamba - Loja - Cuenca - Banos - Quilotoa - Quito - Mindo - Otavalo 

Ecuador turned out surprisingly cheap, despite all the wild stuff we did:  
We did a 3-day trek around a volcano, sleeping in tiny villages; went whitewater rafting (level 4); drank every type of coffee and craft beer imaginable; spent 2 nights in a private jungle; and ate shrimp until we nearly burst.  
Worth noting ‚Äî in Quito we stayed 4 days with family friends who covered everything, but even without those 4 days, the stats speak for themselves:

**Days in Ecuador:** 29  
**Accommodation:** \~$327 USD  
**Food:** \~$403 USD  
**Transport:** \~$140 USD  
**Activities:** \~$84 USD

My mind is ""randomizing"" right now with the things I've been experiencing with rideshare driving. I've been doing gig work for a while, but I'm new to rideshare. I've done OK after one week. My net hourly earnings (after expenses and tax) is $21.05/hr. I've been driving only during the day in the Disney World area. I've snagged a few good paying airport runs each day with some return runs. The shock for me is when I drove to one the two TNC waiting lots. I couldn't believe the number of vehicles in the queue! To be fair not every vehicle was Uber or Lyft. There were plenty of non-gig limo drivers. Still, most of the vehicles were flashing an Uber or Lyft sticker. I parked in order to finish my coffee just to see how busy the TNC lot was. 20 minutes later the only thing I noticed was the amount of vehicles grow! I said to myself, ""Self, the clock is ticking and I'm not earning a dime. Time to go."" I suppose a good airport strategy includes knowing flight schedules and historically good times. This is something I'm going to have to learn if I want airports to be part of my business model.

Now, on to night driving. I've avoided driving after sundown because most bad stuff happens at night. Not that you can't get a drunk passenger at 8:00 AM, but it's less likely. Still, a veteran Uber driver I met told me the better fares are almost always at night. I know this is probably market specific, but is this true in most markets? Is night driving more profitable?

1lphfyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1lphfyh/mirror_mirror/,Mirror Mirror,"I sigh with longing. The same recurring vision.

You look outside the window, and see me already working in the garden. The sun hasn't risen above the tree line yet. You see your breakfast tray next to the bed. For someone who pretends they don't know what a clock is, I bring it to you every morning like clockwork. It's so quiet you can hear the log cabin breathing. It's been few years since we moved there, and part of you still is waiting for the serenity, peace and harmony to shatter. You don't see shadowy figures at the corners of your eyes in our home, you see my light. Like I was everywhere in the house, all at once. You prepeare to grab your things and look at your phone before heading to work, and as you begin to scroll you hear the dogs barking, breaking the silence - probably at the squirrels again, and snap out of it with a smile wondering whether they knew. You grab your coffee and head downstairs, thinking that's what you get for living with a fairy godmother, you'll find the coincidences uncanny.

You decide to take a detour to your workspace through the kitchen to grab a cheat snack from the fridge even though you told me to hold you off from sweets. There is a fresh baked brownie with a note of drawing of a heart on the plate in the fridge. You notice I left the mail in a bowl. It's couple of bills, you are in charge of the money. To people beyond our homestead, you are either are controlling me with money, or I am living off yours. We and the people who really know us know the truth, if it's to do with money, even thinking about it dims my light, much like most things that have to do with society, not people, do, and you have learned even before moving in with me to be responsible of such things, and take certain pleasure in being the woman who shatters gender roles.   
  
Before you, I never had the option to say good bye to all of it if it wasn't for the occasional visitation or adventure to the world beyond our borders, and how for the first time in my life, I felt free. We both knew entering such arrangement was driving the biggest red flag imaginable through the ground for the both of us, and the reality of it seemed like a fantasy. Now, if I have hustled and brought money home, it's been deposited on our joint account, I have none of my own, except one. With equilavent money of one months of your earnings, and money for flight tickets to return to where I came from. I deny it's existence, even from you. Besides, you like to be in charge, of our finances, of most of the decisions. You lead in most things, and you like it that way. You feel like my protector and provider, my hearth and home. And you know how in some things in life, I like being under your mercy, and trust you with certain positions modern society finds entirely condemnable and even taboo. Part of your darkest corners revel with the idea of having a living breathing goddess in your birdcage, that's bars most people do not know even to exist. We both know the door to the cage is unlocked.

Part of you still thinks me sacrificing my nine to five to a backburner, if I have time for it at all anymore - was still too much of a cost for myself and what I could have been with focus solely on it when traded to keep you blissful, your head heart and loins in ecstasy, my beloved as my new nine to five. By every day you see me being more radiant for it, and by the day you trust more that I knew better already. During your working hours I tend to the gardens, the house and check on our furry family members, and do things you may find superstitious, but cute. You still believe in me, and in my power, even if you do not fully understand it. I keep the home like straight out of a catalogue just in case any of our friends decide to visit after your work. They are always welcome, and we do not lock our doors for the night. You enjoy being a hostess as much as I do. And they love to visit, the stead has a certain kind of a charm.

After your work you'll find me napping in a hammock, with a half made charm in my hand, I had fallen a sleep while weaving it. You grab my hand and just look at me, feeling guilty for even doubting whether I'll ever be gone or I would get tired of loving you. I unlocked a version of yourself you thought you couldn't be - thousands of images like these, from our first meeting to the time we say good bye to each other on this Earth, seperated only briefly by death, flash before my eyes. Once again, my heart is filled to the brim with life and love. I feel divine. I feel complete, I feel full.

And I always knew, it's the same for you. You've seen the visions, yours might differ, but they are the same visions. But in the present, you doubt their validity. I know they are true. For a moment we speak the same language again, before my messages for your intuition become incoherent ravings of madwoman.

The difference between us is when it comes to visions, I know it's potential, to be tapped into and released within us, day by day, year by year, something to grow into; not something to simply step into. You carry the weight of all of it, immediately in the moment. And you cannot bear the burden. I know life isn't scripted, and visions too seldom all they seem. I don't want to live in a story written for us before we experience it, I want to experience the rest of my life with you, and by the end of it, tell our story. Of all the peaceful days, and of all the adventures we had. I trust in my visions and intuition to put all in to give you my all, my everything. Not all at once, but a piece of me at a time. To savor every taste, every moment of it. You fear one misstep, and it all burns into ash.

You try to force yourself into boots far too large for you, instead of letting yourself grow into them. If I had known you are so impatient. My bosom and heart would embrace you just as you are, as soon as possible. You won't let me, you push me away, while you stare at the reflection of yourself you see with me. A woman you could be. The woman in the mirror judges you for not being her, right this moment, telling you you'll never be enough for me and my light. Behind the mirror I feel a pedestal that keeps rising and rising until I am out of your reach. Instead of a person, I have turned into the backlight of the mirror of the reflection of the potential in you. And I can feel you, I can sense you, getting lost in it's image.

And once more, the mirror shatters, the pedestal crumbles under my feet, and so does the ground under our feet, and my heart. I fall into the same pit you dug for yourself. You gave up. It does not matter how loudly I shout, I am right here, your ears are deaf to everything but what you could be, but fear you'll never reach. And the shadowy figure of yourself speaks in my name, covers everything I say with your own voice that does not release you from it's destruction until you have destroyed us.

Behind the mirror which you couldn't see, the shadows of your fears ruled. They tore me apart, tried to force me into being a puppet on a strings for you to move, suffocating me by wrapping tighet and tighter, holding my mouth closed so I could not speak, taped over my mouth with it's lies - so there could be no force in the world, nor me, to be against your dreams becoming a reality, not even me. The tighter the strings kept getting, the more you felt like it's all falling out of your hands, as you tried to contain all of it in your grasp. Little did you know the more you felt losing it, the tighter you pulled the strings trying to control and force it, until the strings got so tight they cut me into a thousand pieces, and the love I had contained for you, bled to everywhere and to everything else. I only wish you'd understand, that the love and light you felt and the person who judged you for not being her in the mirror was you, not all all at once, but someone who first begun to glow, and then shine like the sun. If you'd only know how much pride I'd take in being the moon who's gravity shifts the tides to help the waters carry to you every nutrient and nourishment, everything you need to become the image of you you see.

I still see beauty in the world to comfort me. I can still buy myself flowers, even though I feel like I can't even breathe while I stand in the wreckage, I know my love remains mine, as yours does yours. I'll dance in the rain, make it my lullaby. In my dancing steps, the pieces of me regather back into their places. Like broken pottery fixed with gold, I'll grow new seams.

There is a part of me that wishes to forgive you. Part of me asks what is there to forgive. But my mind can't forget, I can understand - yet. I will not hold it over you, would I ever judge you, though? Not for that. Not for any of it. Just a few years ago, I was just like you. No, I was just like you. I only ask myself, will there be another you, or will I finally have you. Another vision. When I am complete, another vision will be by my bedside, like clockwork with the breakfast tray.

Yet, in this world I must disguise as a flower that will captivate. In this world, I must learn it's song and play along. A woman like me wears two faces, one for the world, one for those that beheld it privileged, the ones my vision who captured me and branded my heart before I could even say at last, I am here. You know this all too well. Just as you know the me who seemingly anticipates all your needs, reads your thoughts and knows exactly what you are feeling, and the me who shuts the entire world out and willingly puts on blinders before her eyes.

And so in my dance, I turn away, from everything and everyone that is in my way. I see in every turn a step I take away from those who in their envy would tear my petals only to place it behind their ear, the jealous who'd tramble the entire rose just to see it never to bloom. Those who'd ask me to settle without the visions or those who tell me they'd never let theirselves be moved by my gravity. Some even tried to take the love letters and the love that comes with opening them you wrote and cross your name over and write their own name over them instead. As if I would not notice it's your handwriting.

Only to make my way again, to you. Is it the same you, a new you, or another person entirely, only the next vision will tell. I'll do my all to keep myself from becoming weary and doubtful, that you would ever see beneath the surface of the water and see yourself in the reflection for what it truly is, that you would ever see the woman holding up the mirror. To the you that does, I say throw the mirror away, and you get to see me naked. Everything in it, is already in you.",2,1751414270.0,dating,1,1.0,False

She‚Äôs has those gross droopy lips that drool and slobber. If she barely grazes your pants especially if they‚Äôre black they will leave a gross white crusty stain. She likes to look out the front window and gets gross slobber all over it and looks disgusting.

Then the hair. It‚Äôs so itchy and is the type that‚Äôs short and thick and so hard to get out of certain materials no matter what you do. The amount of lint rollers I go through and sometimes it barely helps. She also farts all the time and when she does it STINKS. I told him maybe it‚Äôs her diet but he said it‚Äôs just the breed. Oh and don‚Äôt get me started on the mouth sounds. She‚Äôll lick herself and chew her paws and it drives me up the wall. Oh and his family is also crazy for dogs specifically boxers. I go over to a relatives house and got 4+ dogs running up to me slobbery mouths licking me and just being straight up annoying.

I‚Äôm not going to leave my boyfriend because of her, but he really did make me realize I would never ever want to own another dog after her, and I told him that. I just don‚Äôt understand why anyone would WANT a dog especially a breed that slobbers, farts, stinks, the hair, annoying.

- When I met my husband he diagnosed me as ADHD and start to buy me drugs illegally to take.
- He couldn‚Äôt stop talking about his ex (10y together and 2 separate) with comments like: shes a bitch, she got sick and can‚Äôt get out of bed, i feel bad for her, my life moved forward and hers went backwards.
- If i complained about it he would ask me if i took my ‚Äúmeds‚Äù (he used to say when i took them i was quieter). 
- First time he yelled at me when i made a joke about him and his ex and he said that I WAS THE ONE dropping her name. He only noticed he was wrong when my stepdad and his bestfriend said that IT WAS HIM. 
- I couldn‚Äôt marry wearing white or invite any friends. Only the 2 witnesses. 
- 3 weeks of our wedding he broke his promise (to let me know if he and his ex were in touch) but what broke my heart was that he mentioned that he bought a house but didn‚Äôt say anything about getting married.
- His mum constantly crying and talking about his ex.
- His stepmom comparing the way he treated me x his ex, asking if i was introduced to her and trying to make me argue with him. He didn‚Äôt ask any one to stop. 
- I couldn‚Äôt spend my own money I needed to talk to him first and ‚ÄúWE‚Äù needed to agree with it. 
- I needed to REMOVE MY RING to see his stepmom.
- I needed to force him to say the truth about our wedding to his family.
- He knows i came from a very abusive background (so does him), where my mum tried to put me to work as a stripper, i got abused, have tried to commit, ended up in a hospital and 10y later im scared of hospitals and haven‚Äôt been to one yet üö® THIS IS IMPORTANT 
- I was diagnosed with ADHD AND ADD and start to take the right meds. 
- He was ALWAYS the perfect husband who was calm and could see his wife underneath the adhd and would wait for me to get better. 
- Found out HPV16 positive
- KIDS? Kick me down stairs, abortion or divorce.
- PETS? Divorce. 
- I needed to give him attention WHEN he wanted. Same goes for sex. Otherwise he would say that im rejecting him OR im using it as a weapon.
- My bday all i wanted was for him to cross the road and get me a coffee. I have waited until 11am. Nothing. Not even a cake.
- I stayed 12 months without bleaching my hair (i couldn‚Äôt use my money?) and explained to him how important is my hair and the color and remind me of the time i stayed 3 days in ICU the dark color.
- XMAS he had a tantrum in the shopping center i decided that we should go home. He said it was my fault that he couldn‚Äôt buy me a gift card to get my hair done. I didn‚Äôt let him buy it (he could have bought it online).
- XMAS2: no gifts, not even a xmas card. 
- DARK HAIR 
- Couldn‚Äôt speak or see my mum (divorce if i did).
- NY: no plans i was crying in the bed feeling ugly and alone.
- He got tickets for us to see my family overseas.
LAST DAY TOGETHER: 
- Im cleaning the house
- Work
- Paperwork to travel
- Organizing the suitcases 
- Sciatic nerve pain
- Anxiety attack
- Asked for help
- He refused to let me take my anxiety pills.
- Said: ‚Äútake 2 adderalls (on top of what i took) every 1 hour and ill come and check if you need your anxiety meds‚Äù.
- Started to argue with me. 
- I go take a nap on the car. 
- Come back and get ready to travel even if i was already fried. 
- He cancels the trip, i beg on my knees, he steal my keys, throws my suitcase downstairs and kick me out. I ended up in hospital. 

6 months now. I was served a restraining order in May. Up till that he went 5x to my door to drop random stuff i didn‚Äôt ask. I havent done ANYTHING to him but I AM THE ABUSER ? 

Some of my documents are with him. He returned my car broken. I have lost my job. He wants to kick me out of the country and im waiting for a biopsy to see if i have cancer or not. 

Still i keep choosing to NOT do anything and not fight back for my peace of mind. I know the truth.

1lphb2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1lphb2d/best_passive_income_ideas_in_2025_top_strategies/,Best Passive Income Ideas in 2025: Top Strategies for Long-Term Wealth and Freedom,"Most of us are over the idea of working 40+ hours a week just to feel like we‚Äôre barely catching up. We want options. Income that comes in even when we‚Äôre not grinding. Something that buys time back without draining us.

That‚Äôs what passive income promises. But if you‚Äôve ever tried following some YouTuber‚Äôs advice about selling eBooks or running a Shopify store, you know it‚Äôs not that simple. Passive doesn‚Äôt mean instant. And it definitely doesn‚Äôt mean effortless.

The real game in 2025 is building digital assets and systems that do the work after you‚Äôve set them up right. If you‚Äôve been searching for what‚Äôs actually working this year-what pays, what scales, and what doesn‚Äôt waste your time-this blog‚Äôs built for you.

# High-Yield Digital Assets for Modern Investors

Right now, the most powerful passive income moves are digital. Not because it‚Äôs trendy-but because the internet lets you build something once and keep earning from it without needing to be present 24/7.

You don‚Äôt need to be a coder. You don‚Äôt need a huge audience. But you do need to be smart about what to build-and how to set it up.

**What are the most profitable digital products to sell passively in 2025?**

If you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúebooks and printables,‚Äù pause. They still work-but they‚Äôre not the heavy hitters anymore. The best digital products right now are built for a specific person, solving a very real problem.

Think templates people actually need to use at work. Notion setups for content creators. Client onboarding kits for freelancers. Pitch decks for early-stage startups.

And here‚Äôs the thing-most of these products don‚Äôt even require fancy design. If you‚Äôre solving something that causes daily stress (like managing content calendars or pitching clients), you‚Äôre golden. The people buying aren‚Äôt looking for beauty-they‚Äôre looking for speed and relief.

I made a simple ‚ÄúWeekly Reset‚Äù dashboard in Notion during burnout season in 2023. It was nothing fancy. But it helped me get my life together. I listed it for $9 on Gumroad. By the third month, it had made over $700-mostly from people finding it through Pinterest and Reddit.

**Book Insight**: In $100M Offers (Alex Hormozi, Chapter 2), he makes it clear: ‚ÄúPeople buy solutions, not features. And the more specific your promise, the more valuable it becomes.‚Äù

**Creating and monetizing niche blogs with AI tools**

Blogging sounds old school-until you realize how powerful it still is. In 2025, niche blogs are one of the best-kept secrets for stacking passive income, especially if you layer in AI to do the heavy lifting.

But it has to be niche. Like, painfully specific. Think ‚ÄúAI tools for tattoo artists‚Äù or ‚Äúside hustles for military spouses.‚Äù The more dialed in, the better.

You don‚Äôt need to be a great writer. Tools like KoalaWriter, NeuronWriter, or even ChatGPT can help with first drafts. Your real job? Picking the right keywords, building topical authority, and writing content that actually helps people-not just hits SEO checkboxes.

If you‚Äôre consistent, you can monetize through affiliate links, display ads (Mediavine is solid once you hit traffic), and even your own products. And once a post ranks, it keeps earning for months-even years-without you touching it.

I started a niche blog in 2022 called ‚ÄúWork From Home Helpdesk.‚Äù For four months, it got almost zero traffic. I almost quit. But in month five, one article on ‚ÄúBest Budget Office Chairs‚Äù blew up. That single post has earned $2K+ in affiliate sales-and I haven‚Äôt edited it in over a year.

**Book Insight**: MJ DeMarco writes in The Millionaire Fastlane (Chapter 14): ‚ÄúIf you want freedom, stop trading time for money. Build something that works while you sleep.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what niche blogs can become.

**How to license online courses and tutorials for passive income**

Here‚Äôs something most course creators won‚Äôt tell you: trying to sell a $59 course to strangers on Instagram is exhausting.

You know what‚Äôs better? Building one solid course, then licensing it out to 10 companies who each pay you thousands to use it for internal training or client education. No launches. No sales funnels. Just one well-made course with repeat buyers.

Say you build a course called ‚ÄúBeginner AI for Non-Tech Startups.‚Äù Instead of selling it B2C, you reach out to startup accelerators or tech communities and license it to them. They get the content-they don‚Äôt have to build anything. You get paid-without needing to teach live or answer support emails.

Platforms like Thinkific Plus or Kajabi Pro are making this easier than ever. And with AI tools, creating the content takes a lot less time than it used to.

**Book Insight**: In Company of One (Paul Jarvis, Chapter 9), he says: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to grow a business by growing your workload. The smartest growth is systems-first.‚Äù Licensing is one of the cleanest systems there is.

**Earning from YouTube automation channels without showing your face**

Don‚Äôt want to be on camera? Don‚Äôt worry. In 2025, faceless YouTube is more legit than ever.

With tools like ElevenLabs (for voiceovers), Pictory (for video editing), and ChatGPT (for scripts), you can build channels that look and sound polished-without ever filming yourself.

These channels work best in niches like true crime, productivity hacks, celebrity finance breakdowns, or news summaries. Once you get monetized (1K subs, 4K watch hours), your library of videos can keep earning through AdSense, affiliate links, and sponsorships.

The upfront work matters-picking good topics, optimizing your thumbnails, and staying consistent. But once you‚Äôve got a library of 50+ videos? You‚Äôre in true passive income territory.

My friend runs a faceless YouTube channel called ‚ÄúOne-Minute Money.‚Äù He scripts with AI, uses stock visuals, and automates most of the workflow. It took 6 months to earn his first dollar-but now it makes $800/month. He hasn‚Äôt posted a new video in weeks.

**Book Insight**: Tim Ferriss nailed this in The 4-Hour Workweek (Chapter 10): ‚ÄúThe goal is not laziness-it‚Äôs effectiveness. Do what gives you maximum output for minimum effort.‚Äù

# Real Estate Strategies That Generate Truly Passive Income

Real estate sounds like the ultimate passive play-buy a property, sit back, collect rent. But in reality? It‚Äôs a full-time job unless you do it right. In 2025, the only real estate strategies that count as truly passive are the ones backed by automation, smart outsourcing, and new platforms built for low-effort investing.

If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of earning rent money without midnight maintenance calls or managing five contractors at once-this is your lane.

# Best REITs to invest in for stable monthly dividends

If you want real estate returns without owning actual property, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are your best bet. They‚Äôre like stocks, but you‚Äôre buying into real estate portfolios-apartment buildings, hospitals, data centers-and getting paid from the rent those places generate.

In 2025, monthly dividend REITs are back in demand, especially as interest rates start to cool. The sweet spot? Look for REITs with a history of stable payouts, low debt, and properties in high-demand sectors (like logistics or healthcare).

Names like Realty Income Corp (O), STAG Industrial, and LTC Properties are favorites among passive income investors because they‚Äôve consistently paid dividends-even through market chaos.

The trick is not just yield, but sustainability. Don‚Äôt fall for REITs offering crazy high dividends (like 12%+) without checking the payout ratio. If they‚Äôre paying out more than they earn, that ‚Äúpassive‚Äù income won‚Äôt last long.

**Book Insight**: In The Intelligent Investor (Benjamin Graham, Chapter 8), Graham reminds us: ‚ÄúThe investor‚Äôs chief problem-and even his worst enemy-is likely to be himself.‚Äù A REIT‚Äôs 6% stable return often beats chasing a 12% dream that crashes in a year.

**How fractional real estate ownership works in 2025**

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to own a piece of real estate but didn‚Äôt have $200K lying around-fractional ownership is what you‚Äôve been waiting for.

Platforms like Lofty, Arrived, and Landa now let you buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100. You still get paid your slice of the rental income every month, and if the property value goes up, your equity does too. All without lifting a finger.

It‚Äôs not just for hype anymore. These platforms offer vetted properties, handle tenants and repairs, and even let you resell your shares if needed. That means you‚Äôre truly earning income without managing anything.

I put $1,000 into two properties on Arrived in late 2023. It‚Äôs not life-changing money, but I now get $7‚Äì$9 every month in dividends. The best part? I haven‚Äôt checked the dashboard in weeks. It just shows up.

**Book Insight**: In Money: Master the Game (Tony Robbins, Chapter 4), Robbins says: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to own the whole pie to enjoy the flavor.‚Äù Fractional ownership proves that every month.

**Is rental arbitrage still worth it post-AI disruption?**

Rental arbitrage-leasing a property long-term, then subletting it on Airbnb-used to be a goldmine. In 2025, it still works... but only if you treat it like a business, not a side hustle.

With AI tools managing pricing, guest messaging, and booking schedules, the hands-on work is way less than before. But cities are cracking down with stricter short-term rental laws, and profit margins are tighter due to rising lease prices.

So what‚Äôs the play? Focus on mid-term rentals (30‚Äì90 days), especially in cities with big hospitals or remote work hubs. Use tools like Hospitable (for automation), PriceLabs (for dynamic pricing), and Turno (for cleaning crew coordination).

A friend runs three mid-term units in a college town. All leases are under his name, but he automates nearly everything. After cleaning and rent, he clears about $1,200/month. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù-but it‚Äôs 90% automated.

**Book Insight**: In Rich Dad‚Äôs Guide to Investing (Robert Kiyosaki, Chapter 6), Kiyosaki says: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt work for money-make assets work for you.‚Äù Arbitrage can still do that, if you stay ahead of the curve.

**How to automate property management with smart tools**

If you‚Äôre managing rental property yourself-whether it‚Äôs one unit or ten-you already know how much mental space it eats up. Calls at weird hours. Rent reminders. Fixing broken dishwashers. It adds up.

In 2025, smart landlords automate everything. Rent collection? Done with platforms like Avail or Baselane. Maintenance requests? Handled via mobile forms that ping your handyman directly. Even showings can be done with smart locks and pre-recorded walk-through videos.

And if you really want full hands-off? Hybrid property managers now offer √† la carte services. You can pay them just to handle leasing or just to coordinate repairs, instead of giving up 10% of your income every month.

I had a duplex in another state. Managing it used to be constant stress-until I set it up on Baselane, installed remote locks, and hired a local handyman for on-call repairs. Now it runs like a subscription. I check in once a month, max.

**Book Insight**: The E-Myth Revisited (Michael E. Gerber, Chapter 4) says it straight: ‚ÄúIf your business depends on you, you don‚Äôt own a business-you have a job.‚Äù The same goes for rentals.

# Passive Income from the Stock Market and Index Investing

When most people hear ‚Äústock market,‚Äù they think of day traders glued to screens or crypto bros chasing the next pump. But the real money-the quiet, consistent kind-comes from building a passive income machine that grows on its own.

In 2025, automation tools, dividend platforms, and rock-solid investing habits make it possible to earn from the market without trying to time it or obsess over tickers. This isn‚Äôt about hype. It‚Äôs about control.

**Top dividend-paying stocks to buy and hold in 2025**

If you want income from stocks that don't rely on selling them, dividends are the play. And in 2025, companies with steady dividend histories are outperforming the hype stocks. The big shift? More investors are trading ‚Äúfast growth‚Äù for dependable monthly or quarterly income.

Look for companies with a 10+ year track record of paying-and increasing-dividends. These are often called ‚ÄúDividend Aristocrats.‚Äù Think Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola. Boring? Maybe. But boring pays rent.

Also rising fast: utility companies, pipeline operators, and B2B tech firms with reliable cash flow. Their dividends may not skyrocket, but they show up every quarter-like clockwork.

Just don‚Äôt blindly chase high yields. A stock paying 9% might look amazing, but if its core business is crumbling, that dividend could disappear. Always check the payout ratio (how much of profits go toward dividends) and make sure the company can afford it.

**Book Insight**: In Unshakeable (Tony Robbins, Chapter 5), he breaks it down perfectly: ‚ÄúA dividend is proof that your money is working for you. When you own a piece of a company that pays you consistently, you‚Äôre no longer just a consumer-you‚Äôre an investor.‚Äù

**Building a passive income portfolio with ETFs**

If picking stocks feels too risky or confusing, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are your best friend. In 2025, they‚Äôre smarter, more tax-efficient, and built for long-haul investors who don‚Äôt want to babysit their accounts.

You can get exposure to hundreds of companies-tech, real estate, international, dividend-heavy-all through one ETF. And the best part? Many of them pay dividends too.

Want monthly income? Look at ETFs like JEPI (a covered call ETF), SCHD (dividend growth), or VNQ (real estate). Want broad market growth? VTI or SPY give you exposure to the entire U.S. stock market.

And if you're wondering-yes, people live off this. With enough invested, a simple ETF strategy can replace a paycheck.

My cousin‚Äôs dad retired early after 25 years in the military. Instead of cashing out, he rolled everything into a few high-yield ETFs. Now he makes more from dividends than he ever did working-and hasn‚Äôt sold a share in 3 years.

**Book Insight**: JL Collins, in The Simple Path to Wealth (Chapter 7), says it best: ‚ÄúYou can own the whole market. No need to try and beat it. Just ride it.‚Äù That‚Äôs the beauty of ETFs.

**What is the 4% rule and is it still valid in 2025?**

The 4% rule is a classic guideline for passive income from investments. It says you can safely withdraw 4% of your investment portfolio each year without running out of money.

So if you have $500,000 invested, you could theoretically pull $20,000 a year-forever.

But in 2025, it‚Äôs not that simple. Interest rates are volatile. Inflation doesn‚Äôt always behave. And markets are more emotional than ever. Still, the principle holds: if you invest in a diversified, income-producing portfolio, you can create a steady stream of cash.

Newer models like the ‚Äú3.5% rule‚Äù or ‚Äúguardrails method‚Äù are more conservative, especially for early retirees. They flex withdrawals based on market conditions instead of sticking to a hard number.

Bottom line: it‚Äôs not dead. But it‚Äôs not a set-it-and-forget-it formula either. You still need to rebalance, stay diversified, and build with inflation in mind.

**Book Insight**: In Your Money or Your Life (Vicki Robin, Chapter 9), she writes: ‚ÄúThe point of money is to live a life you love. But that life costs something-and knowing your number gives you power.‚Äù The 4% rule is just one way to know your number.

**How to automate reinvestment and dividend capture**

Want to build wealth without manually clicking buttons every time you get a payout? You need automation.

Most brokerages now let you reinvest dividends automatically-called DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan). That means every time you earn a dividend, it buys you more shares, which then earn more dividends. Compounding on autopilot.

And if you‚Äôre using apps like Fidelity, Vanguard, or M1 Finance, you can set your portfolio to rebalance itself and reinvest gains according to your plan-no spreadsheets needed.

There are even platforms like Passiv that connect to your brokerage and do portfolio rebalancing for you, based on your target allocations. You‚Äôre basically putting your income growth on rails.

I set up my DRIP in 2022 and forgot about it. Two years later, I checked and realized my total share count had grown by almost 8%-without me lifting a finger. I didn‚Äôt even notice it happening. That‚Äôs the power of automation.

**Book Insight**: In I Will Teach You to Be Rich (Ramit Sethi, Chapter 6), he says: ‚ÄúThe less you have to think about your money, the better. Set it up once, and let the system work harder than you ever could.‚Äù

# AI-Powered Automation Tools That Make Money While You Sleep

It used to be that earning money while you slept was a fantasy sold on late-night infomercials or YouTube hustle channels. But in 2025, that idea is closer to reality-if you use the right systems. And the most powerful ones right now? They're built with AI.

The difference between someone burning out trying to sell online, and someone quietly earning every night, usually comes down to one thing: automation. Not fake ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù tactics, but real systems that take care of the hard stuff after you‚Äôve done the strategic work upfront. AI is the engine behind that shift.

Let‚Äôs break down how real people are actually using it.

**How AI Affiliate Systems Are Creating Fully Passive Funnels**

You don‚Äôt need to be an influencer, coder, or SEO nerd to make affiliate income in 2025. What you need is focus-and AI to do the repetitive parts you shouldn‚Äôt be wasting your time on. Smart creators are launching ultra-niche content websites powered by AI tools that write product reviews, buying guides, and comparison articles with almost zero manual effort.

It starts with picking the right niche. One with pain points, loyal buyers, and products that don‚Äôt change every month. Then, instead of writing everything yourself, you use AI like Koala or ChatGPT to generate structured, research-backed content. But here's the key: it only works if you actually edit that content into something human, honest, and useful. You‚Äôre not gaming Google-you‚Äôre building trust. And that trust is what turns clicks into commissions.

I once built a micro site around the keyword ‚Äúbest ergonomic chairs for remote editors.‚Äù Five AI-drafted articles, each cleaned up by hand, went live in one weekend. By the next month, the site was making quiet affiliate sales-about $150. Not mind-blowing. But I hadn‚Äôt touched it in weeks. That‚Äôs passive.

**Reselling Digital Products with AI Handling Everything Behind the Curtain**

There‚Äôs a quiet group of creators online making thousands from digital products they didn‚Äôt even design from scratch. In 2025, the resell model is cleaner than ever-and AI has turned it into a one-person operation.

You start with a template pack, ebook, or Notion system-either bought with resell rights or built off PLR (Private Label Rights). From there, you use AI to rewrite the descriptions, redesign the product branding, and even tweak the copy to target specific audiences. Platforms like Canva help with customization. ChatGPT writes the copy. And Gumroad or Payhip takes care of sales and delivery-completely on autopilot.

I tried this with a self-care planner originally built for therapists. I repackaged it as a ‚ÄúBurnout Reset Kit for Content Creators,‚Äù rewrote the landing page with AI, and had it live in three hours. Sales trickled in. Not viral. But consistent. The craziest part? I didn‚Äôt create a single page from scratch.

**Chatbots Are Earning Money-But Only When They‚Äôre Built with a Brain**

Let‚Äôs be honest: 99% of AI chatbots you see on small business websites are garbage. They‚Äôre clunky, irrelevant, or just copy-pasting your FAQ page. But the smart ones-the ones that earn? They‚Äôre trained with purpose.

If you run a digital shop, offer online services, or sell templates, a chatbot trained on your actual offerings can answer customer questions, drive upsells, and nudge people toward buying-all without you doing anything. Tools like Chatbase or Flow XO let you feed your chatbot specific instructions and product data, so it sounds like a real assistant instead of a robot.

I helped a friend who sells Instagram content kits for freelancers. Her biggest problem? People kept asking the same five questions before buying. We trained a bot using her product info and added it to the site. Sales conversion jumped by 12%. That bot now closes more deals than she does-and she hasn‚Äôt answered a single DMs in months.

**Dropshipping in 2025: Only Passive If AI Is Running the Backend**

Remember when dropshipping was everywhere on TikTok? Flashy ads, overnight Shopify wins, and then... silence. That‚Äôs because most people tried to run it manually, or worse, with no plan at all. But here‚Äôs the truth: dropshipping can still work in 2025-if you let AI take over everything you shouldn‚Äôt be touching.

Product pages, ad copy, email sequences, customer support scripts-all of that can now be handled with AI. Platforms like AutoDS connect your store directly to your supplier, so when someone orders, everything from shipping to tracking happens without you doing anything. The only thing you actually need to manage is strategy-testing new offers, updating your store design, and pulling out of slow niches when the margins dry up.

Last year, I tested a dog gear store built entirely with AI. The product research, ad writing, even the returns policy were AI-assisted. Once it was set, I checked it weekly. It made $4,000 net in four months. I closed it after that-not because it didn‚Äôt work, but because it had served its purpose. That‚Äôs the kind of income that funds the next idea.

**Why AI Isn't the Magic-But It Is the Multiplier**

People still ask if AI will ‚Äúmake them rich.‚Äù That‚Äôs the wrong question. The real win in 2025 is that AI makes you faster, smarter, and more scalable. You still need to know what people want. You still need to learn how to test, how to listen, how to think. But once you‚Äôve done that part? AI takes your idea and pushes it out to thousands-without burning you out.

The most successful creators I know aren‚Äôt the ones doing less work. They‚Äôre the ones doing the right work-then letting AI do the rest. It‚Äôs not magic. It‚Äôs leverage.

**Book Insight**: In The 4-Hour Workweek (Tim Ferriss, Chapter 10), Tim says it straight: ‚ÄúDoing less is not being lazy. It‚Äôs being smart.‚Äù That‚Äôs what AI lets you do-focus only on the part that actually moves the needle.

# Low-Effort Passive Income for Beginners

If you‚Äôve ever typed ‚Äúhow to make money while doing nothing‚Äù into Google at 2 a.m., this section‚Äôs for you. Because let‚Äôs be honest-not everyone is ready to launch a faceless YouTube empire or invest $10K into dividend stocks.

Maybe you‚Äôre just getting started. Maybe you‚Äôre broke and tired and looking for something that works without taking over your weekends. That‚Äôs where low-effort passive income comes in. It won‚Äôt make you rich overnight, but it can plant seeds that quietly grow in the background while you focus on your life.

**How to Earn Royalties from Stock Photos or Music**

You don‚Äôt need a DSLR or a record deal to earn royalties in 2025. What you do need is a little creativity and a platform that pays consistently. Sites like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and Pond5 still pay creators every time someone downloads their work. Same with music licensing platforms like Epidemic Sound or AudioJungle.

The trick? Make assets people actually need. Not artsy shots of clouds or random beats with no context. Think utility. Upload stock videos of work-from-home setups, simple lifestyle shots, or lo-fi background tracks people can drop into YouTube edits. It‚Äôs not glamorous. But it pays.

One of my closest friends recorded ambient music on his phone-seriously, just rain sounds layered with soft synths. He uploaded it to a royalty-free platform in 2021. As of this year, those tracks still earn him a few hundred bucks each quarter. Zero promotion. Zero updates. Just quiet, consistent income.

**What Are Micro-Investing Apps and Do They Really Pay Off?**

Micro-investing sounds like a marketing buzzword, but it actually works-if you set it up and forget it. Apps like Acorns, Stash, and Public round up your spare change from daily purchases and invest it into ETFs or managed portfolios. It‚Äôs the definition of passive. You don‚Äôt think about it. It just runs.

Does it make you rich? Not immediately. But that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs about building the habit of investing early-even if all you have is $5 leftover from last week. And with compound growth, those small numbers start to look a lot bigger over time.

I started using Acorns in 2019 during grad school. I didn‚Äôt touch it. Didn‚Äôt look at it. Just let the app round up every burrito, Uber, and coffee. When I finally checked in 2023, the account had grown to over $2,400. All from cents I never missed.

**Earning Cashback and Rewards from Passive Spending**

If you‚Äôre not using cashback tools in 2025, you‚Äôre literally leaving free money on the table. It‚Äôs not a hack. It‚Äôs not shady. It‚Äôs just built into how a lot of modern financial platforms work now.

Apps like Rakuten and Honey give you cashback for shopping through their links. Credit cards like the Apple Card or Discover It pay you for things you‚Äôd buy anyway. Even neobanks like Cred or Fi are giving rewards just for paying rent or doing UPI transfers.

The magic is in automating it. Link your card once. Set it up. Forget it. Every month, a little cash rolls back in. It won‚Äôt replace your job-but it‚Äôs real money for zero extra work.

Last December, I booked a flight using a rewards card and got $68 in cashback. That money covered a week‚Äôs worth of groceries during a very broke January. Not glamorous. Just helpful. That‚Äôs the kind of passive income people don‚Äôt brag about on TikTok-but actually need.

**Can You Generate Income from Data-Sharing Platforms?**

Here‚Äôs a weird one that most people don‚Äôt talk about: data-sharing for profit. In 2025, your browsing habits, shopping behavior, and even fitness data have value-if you choose to share them with platforms that pay.

Apps like Nielsen Mobile, MobileXpression, and even some new crypto-based models are offering small payouts just for running in the background. It‚Äôs not creepy if you know what‚Äôs being collected-and you give permission. And for most, the income ranges from $5 to $20 per month.

It‚Äôs not exciting, but it‚Äôs income from something you were already doing. Browsing. Shopping. Existing online. Just make sure to read the privacy policies carefully and avoid anything that feels invasive.

A roommate of mine made $150 last year just by letting a research app run on her phone. It didn‚Äôt drain her battery or collect anything weird. It just tracked browsing behavior. She used the payout to cover half a month of utilities.

**How Print-on-Demand Shops Still Work with Minimal Input**

Print-on-demand was supposed to die by now. But here we are-2025-and people are still buying niche tees, journals, and mugs from creators who haven‚Äôt touched their stores in months.

The reason it still works? People want specific, personal stuff. Not mass-market designs. That‚Äôs where low-effort creators win. You don‚Äôt need to launch a full brand. You just need a few products that speak to someone really specific.

You set up your shop through platforms like Printful or Gelato. Connect it to Etsy or Shopify. Use Canva and AI tools to create your designs. Once a product sells, the platform prints and ships it. You don‚Äôt hold inventory. You don‚Äôt fulfill orders. You just collect the margin.

A friend of mine sells astrology journals with sarcastic taglines. The designs aren‚Äôt amazing-but they‚Äôre honest and weirdly relatable. She updates them once a year. And they still bring in $300‚Äì$500 a month, fully passive.

**Book Insight**: In Show Your Work (Austin Kleon, Chapter 7), he says: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait until you know who you are to get started.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly the vibe with these beginner-friendly income streams. Start small. Start messy. But just start.

# Niche Passive Income Trends Emerging in 2025

Most passive income guides stop at the basics-dividends, real estate, dropshipping. But the real opportunities often live in the margins. In 2025, we‚Äôre watching niche trends evolve fast. Some are weird. Some are speculative. Some could completely flop. But a few? They‚Äôre already making people quiet money without them needing to show up every day.

This section isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúget rich quick.‚Äù It‚Äôs about spotting under-the-radar plays that, when set up right, can trickle in income for months-or even years.

**How NFTs with Built-In Royalties Offer Residual Income**

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way: yes, the NFT hype bubble popped. But here‚Äôs what survived-the smart contract technology underneath it. NFTs with **built-in royalties** are still quietly generating income for creators, especially in micro-niches like digital art, collectible music tracks, and gated community access.

Here‚Äôs how it works. You mint a digital product (like artwork, a zine, or even exclusive templates) as an NFT and sell it. Each time it‚Äôs resold, you earn a royalty-automatically. You don‚Äôt chase anyone. The blockchain handles it.

People are now using this model for limited drops of digital assets that carry long-term value in small ecosystems. Think music artists who get paid every time their track changes hands. Or course creators who offer NFT-only access to their masterclass, and get residuals on secondary sales.

I know a designer who uploaded a small run of illustrated tarot cards to a Solana-based marketplace. He sold out in a week. Every few months, he still gets random notifications of resales. His royalty? 7.5%. It‚Äôs not predictable, but it‚Äôs passive. And it‚Äôs still coming in, two years later.

**Book Insight**: In The Sovereign Individual (James Dale Davidson, Chapter 6), the authors predicted this exact shift: ‚ÄúDigital property will create income streams detached from geography, gatekeepers, or scale.‚Äù NFTs with royalties prove that‚Äôs already happening.

**Can Renting Out Digital Real Estate (Like Metaverse Land) Pay Off?**

Sounds like a joke, right? Paying money for a virtual plot of land? But in certain spaces, it‚Äôs starting to make real financial sense-especially for early movers in communities with strong brand partnerships.

Here‚Äôs the idea: in platforms like Decentraland or The Sandbox, digital land can be bought, built on, and rented out. You can host events, lease advertising space, or charge entry fees for virtual experiences. And no, it‚Äôs not just for tech bros and crypto nerds. Fashion brands, indie game developers, and even musicians are using this space to connect with hyper-engaged audiences.

The value comes from utility, not hype. A virtual art gallery that hosts monthly launches? That has foot traffic. A sponsored gaming lounge during a digital convention? That brings in rent.

My cousin‚Äôs fianc√© bought a small plot near a music venue in one of these metaverse platforms. He rented it out to a DJ collective for weekly live streams. The payout wasn‚Äôt huge-$75 to $100 a month-but the contract was fully automated. He didn‚Äôt lift a finger after signing.

**Book Insight**: In The Inevitable (Kevin Kelly, Chapter 10), Kelly writes, ‚ÄúThe future rewards those who let go of the status quo sooner.‚Äù That‚Äôs what this kind of virtual real estate is-it‚Äôs weird, but it‚Äôs early. And early movers often win.

**Subscription Box Businesses with Hands-Off Models**

Subscription boxes are nothing new. But in 2025, the model has shifted toward micro-communities and hands-off execution. It‚Äôs no longer about curating 10 random products and stuffing them into a branded box. It‚Äôs about building experiences that people want to keep paying for-and automating the rest.

Here‚Äôs how people are doing it now. They partner with third-party fulfillment centers to handle the sourcing, packing, and shipping. The creator just manages the brand, marketing, and customer journey. Everything else? Outsourced.

One creator I follow built a box specifically for ADHD-friendly journaling tools. It includes tactile planners, fidget tools, and rotating desk items that boost focus. She started with just 40 subscribers. Now it‚Äôs at 600+ and she spends maybe four hours a week running it-because fulfillment is 100% hands-off.

**Book Insight**: In Built to Sell (John Warrillow, Chapter 4), he says: ‚ÄúIf your business can‚Äôt run without you, it isn‚Äôt worth much.‚Äù Subscription models only become truly passive when they‚Äôre designed to run on their own. This new version? It can.

**Using Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for Yield Farming**

DeFi is where the tech-savvy passive income nerds are quietly stacking gains. Yield farming sounds complicated-and, to be fair, sometimes it is-but the basic idea is this: you lend out your crypto in exchange for returns. Like a savings account on steroids.

You deposit your tokens into a liquidity pool. Other people use those tokens for trades or transactions. You earn a piece of the fees. The better the platform (Uniswap, Aave, Compound), the better the rewards-and the lower the risk.

But it‚Äôs not foolproof. If the token drops in value, your ‚Äúrewards‚Äù could be wiped out. That‚Äôs why smart DeFi investors spread across multiple pools, avoid sketchy coins, and only use platforms with strong audits and security.

One friend of mine has a passive yield farm running on stablecoins. His capital doesn‚Äôt swing like Bitcoin does. He earns around 8% annually, automatically reinvested. It‚Äôs not sexy, but it‚Äôs safer-and the wallet grows every single week.

**Book Insight**: In Cryptoassets (Chris Burniske & Jack Tatar, Chapter 9), they emphasize, ‚ÄúThe innovation in decentralized finance is not about price. It‚Äôs about permissionless participation in income.‚Äù Yield farming nails that.



# FAQ: What People Are Still Asking About Passive Income in 2025

Everyone loves the idea of passive income. But beneath all the ‚Äúmake money while you sleep‚Äù buzz, there are real, anxious questions people are still asking every day-usually late at night when rent‚Äôs due, or when burnout hits for the third month in a row.

This section is for the honest, unfiltered stuff. No overpromises. Just what‚Äôs actually true right now.



# What is truly passive income and what isn‚Äôt in 2025?

Here‚Äôs the line that matters: If you have to constantly show up to keep it going, it‚Äôs not passive-it‚Äôs just another job with a new label. True passive income has setup work, yes. But after that? It earns while you‚Äôre offline.

Dividend investing, REITs, YouTube automation channels, digital product sales, and high-performing blog content-those can become genuinely passive once the system is built. On the flip side, things like client work, social media freelancing, or doing product launches every quarter? Those are leveraged, but they still need your time.

The test is this: Could you leave it alone for 30 days and still get paid? If the answer‚Äôs yes, it‚Äôs probably passive. If not, it‚Äôs a hustle.



# How much capital do I need to start earning passive income?

Honestly? You can start with $0-but you‚Äôll pay with time, creativity, or both.

If you‚Äôre starting from scratch, your capital is your skillset. Write content, make templates, upload designs, license music-there are dozens of low-cost paths. You‚Äôll just need to be patient while it grows.

But if you do have cash to invest, the numbers get easier. With $1,000‚Äì$5,000, you can build a small dividend portfolio, buy fractional real estate, start a faceless YouTube channel, or automate a Shopify print-on-demand store. And with $10K or more? You can create diversified income streams that actually cover real-life expenses.

One of my readers DM‚Äôd me recently saying he started with just $350. He built and monetized a blog using only free tools, got into an affiliate program, and made his first $19 in month two. Not life-changing. But it changed his mindset-and that‚Äôs where everything starts.



# What‚Äôs the safest passive income idea for risk-averse people?

If the idea of losing money makes your stomach turn, focus on **asset-backed or guaranteed-return models**. Think high-rated REITs, government bond ETFs, fixed-income mutual funds, or savings accounts with cashback perks.

You won‚Äôt get flashy returns, but you also won‚Äôt wake up to your investment dropping 40% overnight. Look for platforms with long histories, regulated environments, and conservative strategies. Think Vanguard‚Äôs dividend ETFs, Realty Income (O), or even automated investing apps with built-in protection tools like Wealthfront or Betterment.

And don‚Äôt sleep on simple plays like cashback credit cards or loyalty rewards. They're not technically investing-but they are passive income. And they carry zero risk if you use them responsibly.

When I was unemployed in 2020, cashback literally kept my groceries paid. It‚Äôs not glamorous-but it‚Äôs real.



# Can you really retire on passive income alone in 2025?

Yes-but not quickly. And not without a plan that you actually stick to.

Retiring on passive income means replacing your active income with systems that work while you don‚Äôt. That could be a portfolio that throws off dividends. Or a network of digital products that sell daily. Or even rental income from properties you no longer manage.

But here‚Äôs what most people forget: lifestyle matters more than headline income. If your expenses are low and your streams are stable, you can retire early. If your spending is chaotic and your income is tied to trends, retirement‚Äôs a mirage.

One of the earliest retirements I saw was a 33-year-old UX designer who lived off $2,800/month from a mix of REITs, affiliate income, and a faceless channel he hadn‚Äôt uploaded to in a year. He didn‚Äôt live fancy. But he lived free. That‚Äôs the point.

**Book Insight**: In Your Money or Your Life (Vicki Robin, Chapter 6), she writes: ‚ÄúMoney is something you trade your life energy for. The goal isn‚Äôt to stack it forever. It‚Äôs to use it with intention-so you can stop trading your time for it.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what passive income allows.



# Which passive income method pays the fastest this year?

If speed is your goal, two models tend to move fastest in 2025: digital product sales and YouTube automation.

A well-targeted Etsy template or Gumroad product can start selling within days if your SEO is tight and your audience is real. Similarly, a viral YouTube Short on a high-traffic topic (think finance, fitness, productivity) can monetize faster than a long-form blog.

But here‚Äôs the truth nobody wants to hear: most ‚Äúfast‚Äù income methods are only fast because someone put in months of skill-building first. The person who sells $1,000 worth of templates in week one? They probably spent six months learning design and SEO before they launched.

Fast income is a side effect of long-term prep. Don‚Äôt confuse the two.",1,1751413897.0,TheFinanceTrending,4,1.0,False

1lph3c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1lph3c4/living_in_a_nightmare/,Living in a nightmare,"TW: emotional abuse. This is very long. If you don't like long stories, this is one to skip. So, I've been married for 10 years. My husband and I share 2 children with complex special needs. I have been their primary caregiver their entire lives, which I love very much. They make me so happy. I do need a break sometimes, but it's not because of them, it's because I just need a break like any human being would.

For years my husband and I haven't gotten along. It wasn't until a therapist told him that I needed breaks that he decided he would allow me to have them. Before the therapist told him that I needed breaks, he said if I ever needed to leave the house that I needed to take the children with me to give him some chill out time. It's very hard to take our children places alone because they are both in wheelchairs.

So for the past several years my husband has been emotionally abusive. He told me that he was only with me because he wanted to see his children every day. When he doesn't get what he wants from me, he punishes me by withholding help. I do basically everything alone. He works 40 hours a week at a desk job but he likes to come home and put his feet up like he's been out digging ditches all day. Yes I understand how disrespectful that sounds of me to say.

I do all of the housework. He helps feed one of the kids if he is in the mood. In the past few years he started helping with baths because they have gotten pretty heavy and hard for me to lift in and out of the tub. He changes diapers maybe once a day. Twice if he's feeling extra helpful. Some days he is gone from sun up until bedtime, having fun, getting his time off to unwind. This leaves me alone. When I get a break it's only for a few hours. I come home and he has not done any housework.

I did tell him at one point that him not helping around the house made me bitter towards him. He started helping for a little while. A few months maybe. Small chores like unloading the dishwasher, running the vacuum. Nothing major. Then he decided he shouldn't have to do those things.

He speaks hatefully to me. He screams. He curses. He slams doors. He says I nag him. When he helps with the kids he says he is doing my job for me.

To the outside world he is the best dad, such a great husband, and I should be so lucky to have him. His family won't believe me when I tell them how he is behind closed doors. They tell me I'm lying. Most of his family don't treat our children like they exist. We see them on major holidays but that's about it. They don't call, they don't FaceTime, they don't visit. They drive past our house several times a day. His parents drive past our house on their way to see their other grandkids but they don't stop to say hi to my kids.

I recently made a Facebook post for one of my kids birthdays. I tagged everyone that got them a gift or called or came by to visit. I didn't tag anyone in his family. I was making a point that I notice how they mistreat my kids and it is hurtful to me. The post made them outraged. They said it was a public attack on their family, even though I didn't say one bad thing about them. I simply didn't tag them. They came to my house and screamed at me for 2 hours. They insulted me, my character, my parenting, it was awful. I cried for a week after and could barely eat. A few weeks ago one of them texted and said something about going to get coffee with me, which is random because they never ask me to do anything with them. Ever. I didn't reply and I cried for 2 days. It was very very traumatizing to sit through. My husband was in the room while it was happening, encouraging it. He said I deserved it. Later when I told him how badly I was hurt by it, he said I deserved it for posting stupid things on Facebook and if I did it again he would invite them back over to scream at me some more.

Fast forward to now. I started having seizures a couple of weeks ago. They have run tons of tests. All normal. They said it could be from stress and lack of sleep. My husband stepped up for the first week. He actually had me convinced that he might care. That lasted about a week. Then he started being hateful again. I was supposed to be resting and not doing much. I can't care for my kids alone because they are still adjusting my medications. If you know anything about seizure medications, they have some bad side effects. I'm not allowed to drive. He says I sleep too much. He says I'm not lifting a finger to help him with the kids. That's not true. I'm keeping the housework done and I'm helping with the kids just as much or more than he used to help me. I don't want his family coming over to help. After how they spoke to me I don't even want to look at them. He yelled at me about that. He said I'm disgusting to refuse help at a time like this.

I'm supposed to have limited stress right now but he has caused me so much stress in the last few weeks. It's like he's almost doing it on purpose. It will get to the point that I'm crying and he will mock me for crying and say it's my fault. Now that he's having to do so much childcare, people are wanting to help him. They are praising him. Saying he needs a break. Saying he has so much on his plate.

Where were my breaks? Where was my praise? Where was my help? Im bitter about the whole thing. I'm bitter about my new health problems. I'm bitter about my marriage. I'm bitter about his family. I'm bitter that my friends, who I thought were friends and I always helped in times of need, have not checked on me or offered to help. I know I'm having a pity party but I literally have no one to talk to. I've looked into leaving. It's gonna be a long process since my kids are so dependent on me and I can't work a typical job. Some states offer caregiver pay and I'm getting information about that. I just feel deflated. I feel so so hurt. I have cried so much. There's alot more I could write, but for right now that's all I have in me. I've never written on Reddit before. I'm kind of nervous that I will get a lot of mean comments. I guess I'll see how it goes.",1,1751413321.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî the internet was basically invented for two things: cute cats and revolutionary ideas. And lucky for you, this article has both (plus a little extra Bitcoin magic on top). Whether you‚Äôre a feline fanatic, a crypto connoisseur, or someone who just stumbled into this wild digital alley looking for answers, you‚Äôre in for a treat.

Picture this: You‚Äôre walking down the street, minding your own business, when you spot a *Bitcoin ATM*. You pause. ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù you mutter, clutching your coffee. ‚ÄúDo I finally buy some Bitcoin today?‚Äù You think of your cat, Mr. Whiskers, lounging at home like the royalty he is. You imagine him nodding in approval, wearing little sunglasses and batting around a digital coin.

The future is *now*, and you know what you need? A fast, no-fuss way to receive Bitcoin ‚Äî because what if someone wants to pay you in BTC for cat-sitting their crypto-rich tabby? That‚Äôs where the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** comes in:  
üëâ [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

With just a few clicks, you can generate a custom QR code linked to your Bitcoin wallet. It‚Äôs sleek, it‚Äôs stylish, and yes ‚Äî you can even tweak the colors and background to match your favorite furball‚Äôs aesthetic. Want a blush pink background that screams ""I love cats *and* crypto""? Done. Want to turn your payment request into a tiny piece of pixel art? You got it.

Let‚Äôs not forget the everyday utility of Bitcoin QR codes. Selling cat-themed NFT art? Taking donations for your kitten rescue fund? Running a caf√© where cats roam freely and customers pay in sats? A QR code at the register makes tipping effortless. One scan and you‚Äôre stacking sats faster than a kitten stacks naps.

And back to those Bitcoin ATMs ‚Äî they're popping up everywhere these days, from urban downtowns to sleepy suburbs. They‚Äôre making it easier for normies and nerds alike to dip their toes (or paws) into Bitcoin. But even with these accessible machines, you still need a quick way to receive payments. Why fumble around with long alphanumeric wallet addresses when you can flash a QR code and get paid like a crypto pro?

So here‚Äôs your call to action, cat-lovers and coin-collectors: Embrace the future, one paw and pixel at a time. Snag yourself a sleek Bitcoin QR code, throw it on your site, print it for your shop, or tape it to your cat‚Äôs collar (okay, maybe not that last one ‚Äî unless your cat is cool with it).

I upload an old profile photo from LinkedIn and hit post on my ad. Hopefully, Facebook Marketplace has at least a few shoppers looking for help clearing their homes. I start rubbing my burning eyes but something is moving on the right side of my screen.

A model in an ad thumbnail is eating her severed leg. I blink twice. The severed leg grows its own legs and leg arms. The image's intended effect is obvious. If it‚Äôs anything besides a life-destroying attention whore, it is creative. The image is arguably very scary. The leg is now doing things to the model that cause me vicarious embarrassment when I should be terrified. I‚Äôm just so tired.¬†¬†

People in the coffee shop are staring. I‚Äôm sure something has happened. Instinctively, I check myself for feelings of wetness and temperature change. Nothing. I smell the air. There‚Äôs only the smell of coffee and baked goods. A reflection off the coffee shop window temporarily blinds my eyes.

*There it is.*¬†

I force my eyes open. The glass is filled with prismatic rainbows of light. Back and forth they spin, enticingly beautiful in a way that makes you remember the lovely shiver a rainbow can still cause. The coffee shop patrons are leaving the chairs, stumbling forward toward the radiant glass.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù A bearded man wonders, nearly at the glass.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù I gurgle. The terror has finally managed to overcome my exhaustion, so the words come out of my mouth like overcooked okra. ‚ÄúSCHMOOOOK‚Äù is what I hear. Nobody listens to me.¬†

The bearded man‚Äôs fingers touch the glass. A couple of ladies follow suit. Their fingers go from tentative touches to gentle caresses. Seconds go by and they are pushing on the glass like it's denying them entry to the most wonderful place they HAVE to go.¬†

Soon, everyone is heading toward the window except for me. I know this is not going anywhere good.¬†

I pull my voice out from between my breasts. I summon everything I can to be brave and help these people because I cannot handle any more guilt. I shouldn‚Äôt have come to a public place. I just really need free Wi-Fi right now. McDonalds has kids in it every hour of the day.¬†

I‚Äôm so brave, I tell myself repeatedly. I'm always so brave.  Believing my hype, I jump on the table just in time to see the the window glass break into vertical cracks. Its safety glass that won‚Äôt stay safe for long.   Every other person in the coffee shop is pushing against the glass now. Blood trickles down the glass from a few patrons' hands. Red rivulets follow the cracks.

I decide to try something I‚Äôve been working on.¬†I take a deep breath.

*OOOOOOOOKLAHOMA‚Ä¶WHERE THE WIND COMES SWEEPING DOWN THE PLAIN!*¬†

My voice booms loud, louder than the crackles and pops of deforming glass. I can‚Äôt sing well but I can sing LOUD. I just need one of the fixated patrons to notice me.¬†¬†

*I WAS DEHYDRATED 'TIL THE BEAT VIBRATED*

I rap at the top of my lungs. One of the women stops pushing. I plumb the depths of my mind for the most distracting songs I can think of.¬†

*WHAT‚ÄôS UP GAGNAM STYLE!?!*

The Bearded Man pulls back bloody hands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what he says,‚Äù he mumbles, hanging his head down and shaking his head like it's full of bees. ‚ÄúHoly SHIT!‚Äù He yells, noticing his bloody hands. ‚ÄúHOLY SHIT!‚Äù¬†

His outburst distracts the woman next to him. She screams and backs away from the window. The other patrons start doing the same, like waking up dominos. They stumble backwards and look around for whatever caused the situation.

Something warm and moist touches my arm, wrapping itself around my neck. It tightens *a lot*, but I can still breathe, just barely.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm paying attention to you,‚Äù I whisper between gritted teeth, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to survive.‚Äù In response, the warmth stretching across my chest gets hotter. I‚Äôm supposed to wonder how hot it will get. Soon, it will burn me hot enough to do just that.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù The bearded guy asks the store manager. He shakes his head, too busy punching numbers in his phone.¬† This is my cue to leave. Maybe I won‚Äôt though because I might be burnt to death. I don‚Äôt think so.¬† It hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I‚Äôve never been hurt to the point where I can‚Äôt feel it anymore.¬†

‚ÄúCan we go?‚Äù I ask. I‚Äôm not asking for permission. I‚Äôm doing the annoyed thing you do with someone who should know when to leave. I‚Äôm just talking to It like I would talk to an asshole, drunk boyfriend. I know it‚Äôs messed up.¬† Everything is messed up right now. You don‚Äôt notice a pile when it is also a swarm.

The heat calms. Sirens are approaching. I make my escape from the coffee shop quickly, not meeting any of the patrons‚Äô eyes. My car sits across the street, filled to the windows with my stuff. It‚Äôs my home away from homeless. I really don‚Äôt want to sleep in it again tonight. Last night, It kept starting the engine and putting the car in reverse. I need to sleep in something less mobile.

A low voice growls from the sewer grate beneath my feet.

""That's been done before"" I mutter before crossing the street.

The stench in my car is almost unbearable.  I could blame it on too much fast food and sweaty nights, but the eye watering reek is inorganic, almost like melting plastic mixed with acetone.  I really won't be able to sleep in here tonight.  I guess it's time to give up. There's only one place left for me to go.

My nightmare is nearly complete.  I begin the short drive to my parents' house.  The devilish entity that cannot exist without my attention is going to get to meet my diabolical, attention-seeking mother.

1lph1b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1lph1b4/living_in_a_nightmare/,Living in a nightmare,"TW: emotional abuse. This is very long. If you don't like long stories, this is one to skip. So, I've been married for 10 years. My husband and I share 2 children with complex special needs. I have been their primary caregiver their entire lives, which I love very much. They make me so happy. I do need a break sometimes, but it's not because of them, it's because I just need a break like any human being would.

For years my husband and I haven't gotten along. It wasn't until a therapist told him that I needed breaks that he decided he would allow me to have them. Before the therapist told him that I needed breaks, he said if I ever needed to leave the house that I needed to take the children with me to give him some chill out time. It's very hard to take our children places alone because they are both in wheelchairs.

So for the past several years my husband has been emotionally abusive. He told me that he was only with me because he wanted to see his children every day. When he doesn't get what he wants from me, he punishes me by withholding help. I do basically everything alone. He works 40 hours a week at a desk job but he likes to come home and put his feet up like he's been out digging ditches all day. Yes I understand how disrespectful that sounds of me to say.

I do all of the housework. He helps feed one of the kids if he is in the mood. In the past few years he started helping with baths because they have gotten pretty heavy and hard for me to lift in and out of the tub. He changes diapers maybe once a day. Twice if he's feeling extra helpful. Some days he is gone from sun up until bedtime, having fun, getting his time off to unwind. This leaves me alone. When I get a break it's only for a few hours. I come home and he has not done any housework.

I did tell him at one point that him not helping around the house made me bitter towards him. He started helping for a little while. A few months maybe. Small chores like unloading the dishwasher, running the vacuum. Nothing major. Then he decided he shouldn't have to do those things.

He speaks hatefully to me. He screams. He curses. He slams doors. He says I nag him. When he helps with the kids he says he is doing my job for me.

To the outside world he is the best dad, such a great husband, and I should be so lucky to have him. His family won't believe me when I tell them how he is behind closed doors. They tell me I'm lying. Most of his family don't treat our children like they exist. We see them on major holidays but that's about it. They don't call, they don't FaceTime, they don't visit. They drive past our house several times a day. His parents drive past our house on their way to see their other grandkids but they don't stop to say hi to my kids.

I recently made a Facebook post for one of my kids birthdays. I tagged everyone that got them a gift or called or came by to visit. I didn't tag anyone in his family. I was making a point that I notice how they mistreat my kids and it is hurtful to me. The post made them outraged. They said it was a public attack on their family, even though I didn't say one bad thing about them. I simply didn't tag them. They came to my house and screamed at me for 2 hours. They insulted me, my character, my parenting, it was awful. I cried for a week after and could barely eat. A few weeks ago one of them texted and said something about going to get coffee with me, which is random because they never ask me to do anything with them. Ever. I didn't reply and I cried for 2 days. It was very very traumatizing to sit through. My husband was in the room while it was happening, encouraging it. He said I deserved it. Later when I told him how badly I was hurt by it, he said I deserved it for posting stupid things on Facebook and if I did it again he would invite them back over to scream at me some more.

Fast forward to now. I started having seizures a couple of weeks ago. They have run tons of tests. All normal. They said it could be from stress and lack of sleep. My husband stepped up for the first week. He actually had me convinced that he might care. That lasted about a week. Then he started being hateful again. I was supposed to be resting and not doing much. I can't care for my kids alone because they are still adjusting my medications. If you know anything about seizure medications, they have some bad side effects. I'm not allowed to drive. He says I sleep too much. He says I'm not lifting a finger to help him with the kids. That's not true. I'm keeping the housework done and I'm helping with the kids just as much or more than he used to help me. I don't want his family coming over to help. After how they spoke to me I don't even want to look at them. He yelled at me about that. He said I'm disgusting to refuse help at a time like this.

I'm supposed to have limited stress right now but he has caused me so much stress in the last few weeks. It's like he's almost doing it on purpose. It will get to the point that I'm crying and he will mock me for crying and say it's my fault. Now that he's having to do so much childcare, people are wanting to help him. They are praising him. Saying he needs a break. Saying he has so much on his plate.

Where were my breaks? Where was my praise? Where was my help? Im bitter about the whole thing. I'm bitter about my new health problems. I'm bitter about my marriage. I'm bitter about his family. I'm bitter that my friends, who I thought were friends and I always helped in times of need, have not checked on me or offered to help. I know I'm having a pity party but I literally have no one to talk to. I've looked into leaving. It's gonna be a long process since my kids are so dependent on me and I can't work a typical job. Some states offer caregiver pay and I'm getting information about that. I just feel deflated. I feel so so hurt. I have cried so much. There's alot more I could write, but for right now that's all I have in me. I've never written on Reddit before. I'm kind of nervous that I will get a lot of mean comments. I guess I'll see how it goes.",2,1751413166.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

She went to Starbucks and ordered her drinks and for her mom too. He asked for her name alone and he wrote on the coffee one and was like ‚Äúwill call u‚Äù she was like ‚Äúbut u didn‚Äôt write for my mom? Her name is ___‚Äù and she spelled it out. She sat and then there was this other barista who prepared ig and she was sitting facing her back to him and her mom saw the other waving her way so she was like is he calling us. She was like maybe and she took the tray and this guy was like ‚Äúhave a nice time‚Äù she said thanks and she turned and this first guy uk who knows her name just smiled awkwardly and she smiled back and sat down. 
Thennnnnn next day she ordered from home. She ordered a chocolate one, only that mind u. There was no name on the cup but he had written in the barista section of the paper cover his name and ‚Äúyours ____‚Äù she was like okay that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to do. Then she ordered again for her and mom. She ordered the regulars. He exactly put her name on the drink she ordered for herself and her mom‚Äôs drink had no name. And she knew his handwriting cause he doesn‚Äôt mark the things on the cup like ‚Äúdecaf‚Äù like a tick he draws a star instead. And he wrote ‚Äúhave a nice day :)‚Äù on the paper cover. She was like huh. So she was like uk what i will catch him today. Then she ordered again another time the same one. But guess what? There was no name on the cup plus the order was prepared by someone else named different. And then when she ordered again. He wrote his name and underlined it and wrote a message for her saying ‚Äúhave a wonderful day ____‚Äù then inside on her cup he again wrote her name and underlined it too. And then next day when i ordered. She wrote a small message for him on the delivery app saying ‚Äúhey ___ (if u are on shift) thanks for the small notes and messages u write for me ___ :)
Have a nice day!‚Äù Then she got her order and on her paper bag the barista name was something else and inside on her cup the different barista had written ‚Äúhey ____, _____ is not in shift today. And i will let him know, you have a nice day :)‚Äù. So she walked in and he saw her. He was the only one working there. The cafe was packed so she thought she would wait a bit but she decided to just get the drinks and see if someone clears up. So she went and was gonna order. Ofc he came to the computer too to take the order. He said ‚Äúhi‚Äù and she said ‚Äúhey‚Äù then he said ‚Äúim ___‚Äù she said ‚Äúoh yea ur the ____‚Äù he got confused and was like ‚Äúyea‚Äù and she said ‚Äúim the one who sent the message, thank u‚Äù he was like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs u, ____ ‚Äù she laughed while he laughed too and said ‚Äúyes im‚Äù and they kept laughing for few seconds then he was like giving his hand to shake with a huge grin and she gave hers with a huge grin and they shaked hands. They both were like ‚Äúhaha hii‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúthank u, thank u so much for the note‚Äù she said ‚Äúofc, ur welcome‚Äù they both grinned. Then he said ‚Äúwhat would u like?‚Äù She said her drink‚Äôs name and he immediately took the cup and he didn‚Äôt even ask her to spell her name he just started writing it and was like anything else. She ordered a drink one for her mom. And he didn‚Äôt even bother to ask the name to write. Then he said the amount to pay and she opened her handbag to get the card and she could feel someone looking at her while she was searching for it. She paid and he gave the bill and card smiling with teeth. She said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù. And again he was like ‚Äúthank u thank u for the note‚Äù and he gave his hand again and they shaked their  hands grinning. Then she went and told her mom she ordered it and she came and stood leaning against the marble table top while he was preparing our drinks. First he poured all the ingredients for her drink and placed it in the mixer and while it was mixing. She missed him mixing her drink cause she went back to her mom. But after he added the syrup for her mom she leaned against it and watched him do it. He noticed she was there when he turned to catch the water and she felt there was some shift in his body. He catches the water and he looked at her and they smiled. Then he added ice and started shaking it walking back and forth. He avoided to look at her. She took out her phone and pretended to use it whilst watching him prepare. He took out the mix he made for her and poured it in the cup. Then this is where it gets funny. He added whip cream on the top but it overflowed and it‚Äôs started to come out of the cup. He added too much whipped cream. Then when he was adding the chocolate sauce he poured everything out on the marble table top and was like ‚Äúshit‚Äù under his breath. She let out a soft laugh. He immediately went and grabbed a tissue and wiped the marble top and took her cup and washed away the chocolate sauce spilled and smeared on the cup outside he washed it off with water and poured out the whipped cream and sauce. Then he added the rest of the mix that was left behind then added whipped cream and chocolate sauce correctly this time. Then he turned around and gave her the drinks and smiled at her for every single thing he gave. One smile for each drink. Then he gave two tissues and two straws and gave a smile for each time. Then he again was like ‚Äúthank u so much for ur note‚Äù and grinned. She said ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù and grinned. He was like ‚Äúhave a nice day‚Äù she said ‚Äúu too‚Äù and they grinned. Then she gave the drinks to her mom and they started to walk out. She opened the door for her mom and while she was closing it back she had this urge to turn around and then she saw he turned around at the same time she did and waved him from outside through the glass door and mouthed ‚Äúbye‚Äù and he did the same. She turned around and walked to her car.",1,1751412866.0,starbucks,11,0.6,False
1lpgxf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lpgxf0/why_is_my_flow_so_fast_k6_ec680m/,Why is my flow so fast? [K6 + EC680M],"Hello!

Brand new to espresso here and I just made my first espresso this morning and it was absolutely horrible. Very bitter and dark. I know there's a lot of possible issues but maybe you can look at my equipment and let me know what's happening.

So I made a default cup just using the stuff that came with the machine a week ago. It was actually pretty decent. Not good but ok.

So to upgrade I got some equipment. I got a K6 grinder, [this bottomless porta filter ](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Mellow-DeLonghi-Porta-Filter-Bottomless/dp/B08KLG3MK6), and a distributor and tamper that are coming in today. 

First issue, I measured out 14.5 grams of coffee, ground it at the k6 recommended setting of 40 clicks, and it way overfilled my filter. So it just put a little in. Then I measured out my shot at 1:2 and it came out in a second or two.

I Know supposedly too fast means not enough pressure which means not fine enough. I tried 10 clicks, and did just 7 grams of coffee and it hit 14 grams of water again in like a second or two.

My basic question, aside from any advice you have is this. Is my K6 just not going small enough? Will my tamper help me get a better flow so much greater that it'll change this? Just a few seconds to hit that much water seems way too fast to me.

Worth noting I think these beans might be bad. Bought from Kaldi (a chain coffee/foreign food shop in Japan). They're super dark and brittle. They fall apart in my hands sometimes when I pick them up if I'm not careful.

Lewis, his blonde hair, his pale face and his lips locked with a tall, leggy, faceless blonde. His arms wrapped around her waist and her arms flung across his neck.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Renee
I groaned as my phone continued to ring for the fifth time. Who was calling me so early in the morning? I blindly felt around the bedside cabinet, my fingers brushing against the smooth surface. I lay in bed with my eyes closed. My body was heavy with exhaustion from the long week at work, knowing that I would be wide awake the moment I opened them.
I found my phone and peaked my left eye open to see who dare disturb me at this hour. Anyone who knew me, knew I would be asleep at this point and certainly knew that I would not want to speak to the Queen at this hour. I looked at the screen my eyes glanced across as I saw Roman's name pop up on the screen. The jerk. I am going to murder him when I next see him.
""Jerk, why are you calling me at three in the morning?"" I groaned. ""I am not habitual at this hour. Are you trying to kill me?""
""Babe, it's an emergency. I'm on my way over, but I need to stay off the internet until I reach you. At the most, I am twenty minutes away, so get ready to answer the door."" Roman said. His voice was screaming with unease, yet I was unmoved by it.
""Roman, we have discussed this. I am not a little piggy, so do not call me babe."" I sighed.
""Well, I'm glad that you haven't got a problem with getting out of bed, your taking it better than I thought."" He replied. He knows me too well at this point.
""Roman, I haven't finished yet,"" I said, my eyelids drooping as I felt my thoughts slipping away.
""RENEE!"" Roman shouted. Screw, he knows not to wake me up. I am the type of person who is committed to my sleep and staying in bed until the last possible second. My relationship with sleep is my longest commitment to anything. Why does he hate my relationship with my bed?
""Roman."" I said his name calmly, my voice low and steady. ""In a minute, I am going to do something that I thought was not possible. I will commit the murder of a beloved celebrity if you don't shut up and let me sleep. And Roman, I'm telling you I look terrible in that dull, grey prison uniform.""
""You will commit murder, but I'm telling you it won't be mine,"" Roman grumbled. ""Listen Renee, I will be at yours in fifteen. Your key is still in the same place? He questioned uncertainly.
""Mhmm."" I mumbled and then hung up the phone.
My eyes were still closed and although I felt sleepy, I knew that would not happen now. I wonder what Roman meant about me wanting to commit murder. He never jokes about things like that after the incident in 2018.
I chuckled to myself, thinking the last time I met his hooker of an ex-wife, god how he put up with her boney butt for ten years is beyond me. God, she hates me. How he loved her is beyond me. It's better to have experienced love and endured loss than to live with a psycho forever.
Grumbling I felt the heaviness of the blankets on my body as I forced myself up. I elongated my legs and elevated my arms above my head. My gaze travelled to the right, and the bed was oddly vacant. The pillows her untouched and there was a coldness to Lewis' side of the bed. I wonder where he was. It was getting late and he always' lets me know when he was going to be away for work. Oh well, I still slept like a log without his butt in the bed, more star-fishing for me.
I was trying to recall my conversation with Roman as I was still half asleep when I spoke with him. I wonder why he told me to stay offline. He knows I hate social media. I mean, do you know how many people upload pictures of their food online? I mean, if it is so  great, why aren't you eating it? Roland has been trying to get on there for the last two years, with me telling him no bloody way.
I threw the luxurious silk sheets off my body, feeling the cool air on my skin as I pushed myself out of bed. It would not be easy getting out of bed. I forget waking up is one thing and getting out of bed is something else. I feel so warm and cosy beneath the blankets and fresh sheets, like they've welcomed me into their fold - if I leave, I'm afraid I will lose their trust.
With a sigh, I grabbed my luxurious silk dressing gown from the floor and heard the soft swish of fabric as I made my way to the en-suite in my bedroom. My en-suite was a luxurious oasis, with gleaming black tile covering the walls and a large vanity mirror with a gold border. His and hers sinks laid side by side with shimmering gold taps, and a large, cascading waterfall shower. The skylights within the bathroom filled the room with a cosy, golden glow, making it feel much brighter than the cold exterior.
I examined my reflection in the mirror, taking in the sight of my clothes and hair. My raven locks were wild, and my honey-coloured skin was smooth and unblemished. I'd look at my reflection and sigh, longing for a more unique eye colour than the same boring brown. My body was in decent shape; I wasn't too thin, but I wasn't overweight either. My body had generously sized breasts and pronouncedly round hips. I never had the height, coming from a family of small people, and I was only five foot two. It always made me feel like I was too short for the world. The top shelf at the supermarket was always just out of my grasp, no matter how hard I tried. I sighed Theas I grabbed a brush and ran it through my hair.
Feeling slightly better about my appearance, even if it was three in the morning. I grabbed my phone, and I made my way downstairs to the kitchen to make a coffee, knowing it would reduce the risk of me throttling Roman when he came over. I mean, it isn't the first time he has been round, but normally it is because he is staying in the guest room hiding from his ex-wife.
Did I mention I hate her? God, how someone as good as Roman ended up with the devil is beyond me. As I reached the kitchen, I turned the light on. The kitchen comprised white counters and white marble. It was extremely modern and clean. I turned to the coffee machine on the countertop as I stared at my phone. I leaned my forearms on the countertops and peered at my phone.
I wonder what Roman was trying to keep from me. I trust him and I know he wouldn't tell me unless he had a good reason. But he should know me, he should know I never listen to what anyone tells me to do. I scoffed and grabbed my phone and opened up my phone and made my way to the internet app, wondering what to search.
Instinctively, a text came through from Lewis. He told me he was sorry, and it was not what it seemed.
What does that mean? Well, I guess I knew what I was searching. I typed into the keyboard, Lewis Reed, and there were the stories.
""LEWIS REED, FAMOUS PRODUCER SEEN PECKING WITH A MYSTERIOUS BLONDE THAT IS NOT HIS WIFE,"" the murder
""MR REED LOCKED LIPS WITH MISTRESS. FRIENDS CLOSE TO THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN SAY THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR MONTHS.""
""REED SEEN ENTERING HOTEL ROOM HOLDING HANDS WITH A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE.""
Tears welled in my eyes, my breathing was getting erratic as I tried to hold in my pains. Surely this isn't true, it can't be. Lewis wouldn't do this to me. We have been together for so long. I was with him through all the hard times. This can't be true.
I clicked on the links and there he was. Lewis, his blonde hair, his pale face and his lips locked with a tall, leggy, faceless blonde. His arms wrapped around her waist and her arms flung across his neck. The subsequent photograph showed them entering a hotel side by side. A loud sob reverberated through the room as the tears dropped from my eyes. The pounding in my chest was so painful it was overwhelming. There were no words to express it. The betrayal felt like a sharp stab in my mouth. I put my hands over my face, desperate sobs wracking my body, wishing I had never gone online.
Looking back, I wished I had taken Roman's advice more seriously. He was right. I was going to kill someone. It just wasn't him.
.....
Roman
she hung up on me.
I know it is going to hit the fan when I get to Renee's. I can't believe Lewis cheated on her.
We had been working endlessly for the last five years, supporting children from underprivileged backgrounds with the talent to establish a football career. We had supported Ronald who was signed by Chelsea United and was a formidable striker. He has just been selected to play for England in the next World Cup. Thanks' to his endorsement of the charity that helped him start his career we have been getting more donations.
Ronald was a huge supporter of Renee and always credited her for his success. Hence why she had become a big name in our industry and she has no idea. She is so humbled. Honestly I don't understand how Lewis could even cheat on a diamond like Renee. He was lucky, she had the curves and confidence and he chucked her away for a piece of coal.
Lewis has no idea how much of his success is due to Renee supporting him behind the scenes, she had spoken to many investors and producers who donated to the charity. They reached out to Lewis offering him opportunities. I wonder if he knew what Renee had done for him.
I flipped my mirror down in my car and checked my appearance knowing the vultures would be camping outside her gated community. My brown hair was tussled and I had stubble running across my jaw. My blue eyes were covered with dark circles.
I had just finished my interview about the football matches of the day. I was regularly asked as a guest due to my knowledge on the sport when the presenter Jeremy pulled me to the side to tell me about the news of Lewis. He had met Renee many times and loved her like a little sister. I remember groaning and throwing my tracksuit on to make my way to her.
I don't think I have driven this fast in years. 
There in the distance I could see her town home. I could the house was well lit, with the windows. The house was modern and made of red brick. It was nice but it lacked the character that matched Renee's personality.  As I pulled up in the driveway, I could hear the loud music blast through the house.
""You coulda had a bad hooker, non-commit all. Help you with your career, just a little. Your supposed to hold me down, but you're holding me back, And that's the sound of me not calling you back..""
Oh screw, she's listening Lizzo. She's at Defcon one. I hope she is too annoyed at Lewis to try and murder me for waking her up. I turned my car off and made my way to her house. I lifted the flower pot with the blue hydrangeas and picked up the spare key and opened her front door.
The music filled my ears and I made my way into her hallway. I could hear Renee's voice screaming the lyrics. I silently pray for my life as I make my way into her living room. I push open the door and there stands Renee swaying with a glass of whiskey sloshing about and  a baseball bat in other hand. Screaming the lyrics to the song and swinging the baseball bat at pictures of her and Lewis. What does she think she is doing? Why does this girl think she's in the Beyonc√© lemonade video? I wonder how much whiskey she has drunk.
Jesus Christ, I knew it was gonna be bad but not this bad. She's still shouting lyrics her whiskey swishing out the glass. She stops, looks at a picture on the wall, it's one of her wedding day to Lewis. I start to slowly approach her, when she swings the baseball bat at the frame. Glass from the frame falls to the floor. There is a deathly silence as the song finishes. Suddenly, she just starts chuckling manically. she's got a good aim. I really hope she doesn't kill me.
....
Renee's view
I don't know how long I did there sobbing in the arms of Roman. The pain in my chest was increasing and my thoughts were just getting darker and gloomier. Everything was hurting more as my alcohol fulled buzz started to wear off. I mean I have a lot of problems at the moment, but clearly getting drunk isn't one of them. I mean if I could hard my heart for another liver at this point, I would. It's easier to drink more and care less.
I wasn't paying attention to what Roman was whispering because my mind just could not process what was happening right now but he was rubbing my back with was oddly comforting. My bad hooker moments were over and I just felt this heaviness on my chest. Ryan pulled away from me and grabbed my hand and pulled me to the grey three seater sofa and sat me down.
My phone buzzed on top of the coffee table. I knew it was Lewis trying to get hold of me. Truth be told I didn't want to speak to that jerk and I don't think I ever want to speak to him again. I would be happy to play blind for the rest of my life if I didn't have to see him again. I could see Roman clenching and unclenching his fist from the corner of my eye. I could see his frustration. I knew he was not keen on Lewis, but he supported me and got along with him because he was my husband.
I took another swig of whiskey. ""So, you gonna talk to the little hooker?"" Roman asked nonchalantly. The whiskey got stuck in my throat and I sputtered it over the coffee table. I could feel the burn in my nose.
I turned to him with a dead face. I could see him holding his chest trying not laugh at what just happened. He crossed his arms and brought one of them to his face to cover his mouth. I could tell he was trying to hold it in. He's done this in numerous meetings and honestly he can't help himself. I see him let out a huge belly laugh. His chest heaving up and down as he tries to control his laughter.
I sit there patiently with my face expressionless trying to suppress the laughter I could feel building in my chest. Roman has this kind of laugh that is contagious and he knows it. I feel my lips purse as I tried to hide the giggle that escapes my lips. I can see him trying to control it as he tightens his lips. His eyes looking at me with this twinkle of mischief.
As he tries to hold in laughter, he snorts. That breaks me as his face becomes serious because I know he hates when he does this because last time Jack told him he squealed like a little piglet when he did this. That's when I break and the laughter escapes my chest and tears start to escape my eyes. Roman releases the tension in his face and soon we are both sat there clutching our chests laughing.
Honestly I don't know how long we are laughing for, when it feels good.
I fall back into the sofa and feel the tension leave my burdened shoulders.
My phone suddenly starts buzzing again and push my head back into the sofa and look at the ceiling knowing that my content state has now been ruined by the ""little hooker"" in Roman terms. I groan knowing that my problems aren't going to go away anytime soon and I grab my phone looking at the caller ID saying: Lewis.
I swipe the call knowing that as much as I want to avoid Lewis like the STD infested mongrel that he is; I need to deal him. Lewis's voice comes blooming through the speaker as I switch it to loudspeaker so Roman can hear and I won't have to repeat the conversation with him.
""BABE. BABE. BABE.."" I can hear he is in his car, I hear the traffic in the background as he makes his way back from his rendezvous. His voice is panicked but if I am honest I really don't care.",1,1751412851.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

I used to live in the country, but I sold that home and moved to the city. I prefer urban centers because I like easy access to restaurants, parks, and coffee shops. Because I have a job that lets me work anywhere, I‚Äôm sure I can find a city that has all those things without the hot weather. I‚Äôm not looking at places like New York City, San Diego or San Francisco primarily due to COL. I don‚Äôt go ‚Äúout on the town‚Äù very often so a lively nightlife isn‚Äôt really important. I play a lot of soccer and golf as my outdoor hobbies. I want to keep my car and bring my dog with me but other than that I don‚Äôt have a lot of requirements. I‚Äôm renting and don‚Äôt have plans to buy for 5 years.

The four cities I‚Äôve researched so far that makes sense are Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Portland, Maine. I‚Äôve run each city‚Äôs cost for my situation and they‚Äôre all within $1000 of each other in monthly expenses.

i‚Äôve never been to any of these places, but I plan on traveling to a combo of the cities on two different trips. I‚Äôm open to other suggestions as well, but these seem to make sense with what I‚Äôm looking for. Would love anyone‚Äôs feedback or insight!

Hi! Desperate for some help :) We live in a high-ceilinged loft (14-ft ceilings with big windows). I love the space, but it doesn‚Äôt feel complete.

My partner and I have slightly different styles, but we can agree that we both like an uncluttered MCM vibe that still has our own personal touches. The furniture is my partner‚Äôs from his bachelor pad days.

2.	‚Å†Dining room chairs ‚Äî Need some budget-friendly, but stylish and comfy, options. (The current ones are very comfortable, but there is too much grey in the apartment!)

5.	‚Å†Bookshelf and wall ‚Äî Would it look good with a large painting on top? Does the bookshelf look cluttered? My job involves writing so the books are non-negotiable :)

6.	‚Å†Pantry ‚Äî Likely will keep it as is. I recently bought the storage boxes recently to make the open pantry look less cluttered. Thoughts?

Hey r/Shopping and r/DealsReddit,

So, I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a new everyday bag, and it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ a journey. I wanted something that looked good, held all my stuff, and didn‚Äôt make me feel like I was contributing to the planet's demise. You know, the usual impossible criteria. üòÖ

I was tired of the cheap bags falling apart after a month and the guilt of buying something that wasn't ethically made. I needed a solution.

Then, while browsing ursupermart.com, I stumbled upon this ""Woven Handle Eco-Friendly Vegan Leather Handbag."" I know, it‚Äôs a mouthful, but hear me out. I was specifically searching for a ""Vegan Bag for Sale,"" and the woven handle just screamed ""unique"" at me.

The handle is seriously the first thing that caught my eye. It‚Äôs woven, which gives it this cool, textured look that I haven‚Äôt seen on other bags. Plus, it feels super sturdy. I‚Äôve had bags where the straps snap after, like, a week, and that‚Äôs just the worst. Durability is key!

**Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm actually obsessed with this bag:**

*   **Vegan Leather That Doesn‚Äôt Feel Like Plastic:** Okay, let‚Äôs be real, some vegan leather feels like you‚Äôre carrying a trash bag. This stuff is actually soft and supple. It feels like it‚Äôll hold up to my daily grind, and it doesn‚Äôt have that weird plastic smell.
*   **It's surprisingly spacious:** I can fit my wallet, phone, keys, makeup bag (priorities, people!), a book, and even my water bottle. It‚Äôs like a Mary Poppins bag, but without the carpet. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm lugging around a ton of bricks. Improves efficiency, you know?
*   **Spill-Proof (ish):** I‚Äôm a walking disaster. Coffee, tea, smoothie ‚Äì I‚Äôve spilled it all. This vegan leather wipes clean so easily! Huge win for my clumsy self. Saves time on upkeep, which is always a plus.
*   **Ethical Feels Good:** Knowing I‚Äôm carrying a bag that‚Äôs not hurting the planet? That‚Äôs a good feeling. It eliminates that little pang of guilt I used to get when buying things without thinking about where they came from. Decreases stress and frustration, you know?
*   **That Woven Handle, Though:** Seriously, it‚Äôs the best part. It‚Äôs comfy to hold, and it just looks cool. It makes me feel more confident, like I‚Äôm showcasing my commitment to sustainability. Feel more respected, you know?

**Now, the not-so-perfect stuff (but still not deal-breakers):**

*   **Color Options:** The color options are a bit limited right now. I went with a pastel yellow, which I do love, but I'm hoping they'll add more colors in the future.
*   **The Price Tag:** It's not the cheapest bag I've ever bought, but I think the quality and the ethical factor make it worth it. Plus, I'm hoping it'll last longer than those cheap bags I used to buy, so it'll save me money annually in the long run.

**Why This Eco-Friendly Hobo Bag is Different:**

Hey r/Shopping and r/DealsReddit,

So, I've been on this quest, right? To find a bag that doesn't make me feel guilty every time I use it. You know, something stylish, practical, and actually eco-friendly. Turns out, that's harder than it sounds! I've been drowning in options that either look like they're made of plastic or cost more than my rent.

Then, I stumbled upon this ""Woven Handle Eco-Friendly Vegan Leather Handbag."" Yeah, it's a mouthful, but stick with me. I saw it on ursupermart.com while searching for a ""Vegan Bag for Sale,"" and it caught my eye.

The first thing that got me was the handle. It's woven, which gives it this cool, unique vibe. Plus, it feels really solid. I've had bags where the straps break after a week, and that's just the worst. Durability is a MUST.

**Okay, here's the breakdown of why I'm actually loving this bag:**

*   **Vegan Leather That Doesn't Suck:** Seriously, I've touched some *questionable* vegan leather in my day. This stuff actually feels nice. It's soft, not plasticky, and seems like it'll hold up to my daily abuse.
*   **It's Like a Tardis:** I swear, this hobo bag is bigger on the inside. I can fit my wallet, phone, keys, makeup (because priorities), a book, and even my water bottle. And it doesn't feel like I'm lugging around a boulder.
*   **Spill-Proof (Almost):** I'm a walking disaster zone. Coffee, smoothie, you name it, I've spilled it. This vegan leather wipes clean so easily! Huge win for my clumsy self. Saves me time on upkeep, which is always a plus.
*   **Ethical Feels Good, Man:** Knowing I'm carrying a bag that's not hurting the planet? That's a good feeling. It eliminates that little pang of guilt I used to get when buying things without thinking about where they came from. Decreases stress and frustration, you know?
*   **That Woven Handle, Though:** Seriously, it's the best part. It's comfy to hold, and it just looks cool. It makes me feel more confident, like I'm showcasing my commitment to sustainability.

**Now, the not-so-perfect stuff (but still not deal-breakers):**

*   **Color Me Bored (Slightly):** The color options are a bit limited right now. I went with a pastel yellow, which I do love, but I'm hoping they'll add more colors in the future.
*   **The Price Tag:** It's not the cheapest bag I've ever bought, but I think the quality and the ethical factor make it worth it. Plus, I'm hoping it'll last longer than those cheap bags I used to buy, so it'll save me money annually in the long run.

**Why This Bag Is Different:**

I've gone through a LOT of bags. What makes this one stand out is that it's stylish, sustainable, and well-made. It's not just a pretty face; it's a bag I can feel good about carrying. I get compliments on it all the time, and it feels good to know I'm making a more conscious choice. I feel most satisfied with this bag.

It solves a real problem for me. I was tired of choosing between looking good and being responsible. This bag lets me do both. It streamlines my daily routine by providing a stylish and functional way to carry my essentials. Improves efficiency, you know?

I was initially looking for a ""Sustainable Handbag"" and this one popped up.

1lpgh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1lpgh84/handbag_review_vegan_leather_ecofriendly_stylish/,Handbag Review: Vegan Leather - Eco-Friendly & Stylish!,"**Title:** Handbag Review: My New Vegan Leather Handbag obsession - Eco-Friendly and Stylish!

Okay, Reddit, I gotta share. I've been on the hunt for a new bag for ages. Not just *any* bag, though. I wanted something stylish, of course, but also something that aligned with my values. You know, the whole sustainability thing. I was tired of feeling guilty every time I bought a new purse. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So, the struggle was real. Everything I found that looked good was either crazy expensive or made from materials I didn't feel great about. And the ""eco-friendly"" options? Let's just say they often sacrificed style at the altar of sustainability. It was frustrating!

Then, a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this Woven Handle Eco-Friendly Vegan Leather Handbag. And honestly? I was skeptical at first. Vegan leather can be hit or miss, right? Sometimes it looks and feels cheap. But the woven handle detail caught my eye, and the description talked about using sustainable materials. So, I figured, what the heck, I'll give it a shot.

And I am SO glad I did! Seriously, this bag is amazing. First off, the vegan leather is surprisingly durable and looks really high-quality. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on it already, and people are shocked when I tell them it's not real leather. I've been using it every day, and it still looks brand new, which is a major plus.

The woven handle is also a game-changer. It's so unique and adds a touch of elegance that I haven't seen on other vegan bags. Plus, it's actually really comfortable to carry. I've lugged this thing around all day, and my shoulder doesn't even hurt. A major win in my book!

But the best part? It‚Äôs guilt-free! Knowing that I‚Äôm carrying a bag made with eco-friendly materials makes me feel so much better about my purchase. It's a small thing, but it makes a big difference to me. I feel like I'm actually doing something positive, even if it's just a little bit.

Size-wise, it's perfect for my everyday essentials. I can easily fit my wallet, phone, keys, a small makeup bag, and even a book. And there's still room to spare! I hate feeling like I have to cram everything into my purse, so this spaciousness is a major plus. I even used it recently on a short weekend trip and it was the perfect size for everything I needed to take.

Cleaning is easy, too. I spilled coffee on it the other day (oops!), and it wiped right off with a damp cloth. No stains, no fuss. I've had other bags that would have been ruined by that, so I'm definitely impressed with the durability.

Before finding this bag, I was constantly buying cheap, trendy bags that would fall apart after a few months. Not only was it wasteful, but it was also costing me more money in the long run. This bag feels like an investment. I know it's going to last for years, which means I'll actually be saving money in the long run. Plus, it's just so much nicer to carry a bag that you know is well-made and ethically sourced.

I was telling my friend about it the other day, and she was asking where I got it. I found it on ursupermart.com while searching for a unique gift idea, and ended up buying myself this little gem. She's super picky about her bags, so that's saying something!

For anyone who is looking for a great Vegan Leather Handbag, I highly recommend you give this bag a try. I know there are a lot of choices out there when it comes to handbags but not all bags are created equal and this Woven Handle Eco-Friendly Vegan Leather Handbag is definitely worth a look. I really hope this review has helped you, and if you have any questions just ask away in the comments section.

1lpgh28,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lpgh28/my_girlfriend_24f_is_jealous_of_my_female_friends/,"My girlfriend (24F) is jealous of my female friends, job, and even my best guy friend I (21M) feel like I‚Äôve made all the compromises. Is this relationship sustainable?","Hi Reddit, I‚Äôd really appreciate your honest input on this. Apologies in advance as this is my first post. 
I (21M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about a year and 8 months. We met in a university club in early 2022 and officially got together in late 2023. The club required you to be a student to join, but our university has multiple campuses she was based at a different campus, about an hour‚Äôs drive away. She eventually left the club in her final year to focus on graduating, while I stayed involved.
Because we lived on different campuses, we had what you might call a medium-distance relationship. She would usually come visit me (she had a car), or I‚Äôd hitch a ride with mutual friends from the club to see her. We mostly saw each other on weekends.
I‚Äôm a naturally social person, and that‚Äôs helped me land a few jobs one of which involves taking students and tourists around town. The catch is, I live in a university town that has a lot of tourist destinations around it so the job lets me experience some pretty cool places. These are places I‚Äôd never be able to afford on my own as a student.
But this has caused a lot of tension. She‚Äôs expressed jealousy over the fact that I get to go to these places ‚Äúwithout her.‚Äù I do get it I'd also want to experience those things with someone I love but it‚Äôs literally part of my job. I also can‚Äôt be on my phone all the time while working or hosting people, which has caused arguments too. She says I don‚Äôt make time to reply to her during the day, but I think it‚Äôs rude to check my phone mid-conversation with tourists or guests.
Meanwhile, she‚Äôs in a demanding profession herself and will go hours without texting, which is totally fine by me. I don‚Äôt expect constant contact. But I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt always get that same understanding in return.
The biggest issue in our relationship, though, is my female friendships.
I‚Äôve always been someone with a mix of male and female friends. The club we met through is gender-balanced, so naturally I‚Äôve made strong friendships with people of all genders some of which go back years. Before we made things official, I told her upfront that I had a lot of female friends and that I wasn‚Äôt willing to lose them to be in a relationship. She said she was fine with it.
But over time, that changed. She started getting uncomfortable with me spending one-on-one time with female friends, even ones I‚Äôd been seeing for coffee or going for runs with long before we dated. To ease her mind, I cut back on these kinds of hangouts, especially with friends outside the club. I‚Äôve done my best to show her she comes first. But it‚Äôs reached a point where she‚Äôs now upset that I talk to any female friends at all, even ones who are in the same club we met through.
She says she feels like she should be ‚Äúenough‚Äù and that I don‚Äôt need so many (or any) female friends. I just don‚Äôt agree. I don‚Äôt think getting into a relationship means cutting off half your existing social circle.
What really confuses me is that it‚Äôs not just women she‚Äôs jealous of. She‚Äôs told me she doesn‚Äôt like my best male friend either, someone I met in my first year of college, who also happens to be from my hometown. We bonded over being far from home and built a real friendship. We‚Äôre both straight, there‚Äôs never been anything romantic or physical there, but she says she doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúwhat he means to me.‚Äù
I‚Äôve also noticed that whenever I bring up how I‚Äôm feeling in our relationship whether it‚Äôs burnout, guilt, or just needing to talk she tends to shut down. Our main form of communication is calling at night, and if I bring up something serious, she often goes quiet. That silence can stretch for hours while I wait for her to say something, and it makes tough conversations almost impossible. Meanwhile, if she is upset, she usually tells me  unless it‚Äôs about the same issue again (female friends), in which case she‚Äôll just say something‚Äôs wrong but won‚Äôt talk about it.
She has told me she‚Äôs ‚Äúworking on her jealousy,‚Äù but this has been an issue for our entire relationship, and I don‚Äôt know how much time I‚Äôm supposed to give it.
Since she graduated, she‚Äôs now working in a town that‚Äôs a 2-hour flight from where I study,which is close to where her family lives so when she visits her family, she also visits me. We‚Äôve seen each other about five times this year. We‚Äôre long-distance now, and will be for at least the next two years while I finish my degree and she completes her work placement. I can‚Äôt move to be closer, and she can‚Äôt either.
I love her, and I believe she loves me. But I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôve compromised everything my friendships, my hobbies, even how much I share about my job just to avoid conflict. Sometimes it feels like she wants me to put my entire life on pause until we‚Äôre together again, while also demanding emotional closeness that‚Äôs hard to maintain under this kind of pressure.
So here‚Äôs where I need advice:
* Am I being unreasonable for wanting to maintain my friendships and social life while still being committed to her?
* Is this just insecurity, or something deeper?
* At what point does compromise become self-erasure?
* How long do you give someone to ‚Äúwork on‚Äù something like jealousy before accepting that it may never change?
Any insight especially from people who‚Äôve been through long-distance or jealousy struggles would really help. Thanks in advance.",2,1751411621.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

The breakup was wild and sudden for me and i've never experienced anything like that, so my days on went in complete shock, confusion and guilt, until i found this place.

Fast foward a week and i read many stories and, oh boy, i felt reliefed reading every post and realising she checked EVERY sympton/trait, which made me upset at first, then sad bc she would never realise and dump her life, etc; the thing i what i want to bring this up is because i read many times about the phases of a BPD person after discarding someone (in this case, me, after one month of relation), specifically the part that they realise they dump their only validation/emotional/phisical support and come back, not to ""beg"" but to ""check"" and ""talk things bc the closure THEY took made them think things"" and i really, REALLY hoped she wouldn't do that because of self respect and the ""hate"" she had for me.

  
I'll keep details simple, but she exploded, discarded me, she wanted to talk things in person, i set boundries to talk without fighting, she agrees, next morning she ""made up her mind, gave herself the closure she needed"" and told me to never bother her again; a couple hours she text me again saying she has a letter for me and want to give it to me personally, i don't reply and follow my day; unfortunately, we live in a really small city so we end up ""coinciding"" in a indie movie projection, she acts like NOTHING happened, i keep my distance and constantly taps my shoulder to say little things (i know i should've leave but i reserved in that movie days prior and didn't wanted to loose my safe place bc of her); after the movie ended, she gave the letter and i accompanied her to take the bus, she didn't wanted to talk at all, at one point she told me she FORGIVES me and i didn't react like normally do (asking wtf she meant by that), instead i thank her and told her i forgave her too; she walked faster and i was so saddened i decided to not to follow her; after that night i got a bit calmer and decided to block her and the group chats we were in.

After a week dealing with myself, emotion changes, writting poetry, going to theater shows and attending therapy (i've been almost a year before this taking sesions) i was starting to accept the fact that there was nothing i could do before other than leave and starting forgiving myself and thinking about improving and what kind of relationships i want in the future (bc i feel mentally/emotionaly burned right now) she unblocks me from IG and sends me a long message; i was with a friend, fortunately, and helped me a bit to get calm and decide what to do; it was on saturday and i decided that the best for me was not acting impulsively, talking to my therapist on tuesday and decide if i read it or not. 

  
I got a glance on that day of it in the notification bar but never oppened the message itself, i read something like ""we haven't talked since i gave you the letter and i've been thinking-""; tuesday comes in, i get prepared on the morning and also my rest day from work and talk at the end of the sesion with my therapist, she tells me that if i can read it but think about what to do, say or respond before and after reading it. I went to a coffee shop, i ordered some breakfast, i listenned some music and when i felt ready, i read the message and, oh boy:

There was no apology, no actions accountability, and if they were, were so dull like saying ""i know i did things, at least on my side, but we both have problems to work around; that she feels ""scared or guilty"" by texting me bc i didn't texted her since her letter and that she loved me and have no doubt about it, that she still thinking what happened when she discarded me and that SHE DOESN'T HATE ME or anything else and wishes me and my cats a good day. I just laughed in shock thinking it was IMPOSSIBLE that ""subtle"" way to deflect all she did and acting ""nice"" about it.

I honestly don't know what should i do; cofronting her knowing she won't understand and she'll feel attacked it's a no no; telling her that theres nothing to talk and she made it very clear tempt my hurted self, but still futile for me; blocking her without saying anything seems the most self rewarding to me bc, for me, this means she won't listen or account any responsability no matter how i explain things to her.

I really hope she doesn't reach my house or work bc i would probably explode and i've lear and experienced so much to do that, What should i do?",3,1751411304.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

I really did scrape by to get that degree since I suck at math, but I did have a job lined up after graduation.

I don't get any family encouragement since I'm considered a ""loser"", and I feel like just giving up. I don't know what I can do. I attend career fairs, network, message people, set up coffee chats, work part time as a math teacher- I try all these things and there's no reward. I hate the major, I hate all the career paths it entails, and yet I suffer not being able to land a job. It's constant L's exponentially. I'm too scared to pivot careers because sunken cost fallacy and also just being attached to the title of ""mathematician"" but I'd rather be some graphic designer or UI designer who makes decent money than continue to suffer with this useless degree path. I know it sounds messed up but I want to measure up to my siblings who are doctors and engineers- I hate conventional success yet still want it. I don't know what to do with this career path??",1,1751411262.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False
1lpgcb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/comments/1lpgcb1/seattle_to_pacific_coliseum/,Seattle to Pacific Coliseum,"Hi all,

I'll be watching the League of Legends match on Saturday, July 12th. I'll be driving from Seattle and have a tentative plan but looking for feedback from people that are more familiar with Vancouver and Pacific Coliseum.


8:00-10:30 Depart Seattle and cross border (Pacific Highway)

10:30-11:30 Drive and arrive in Vancouver

11:30-2:30 Coffee and Lunch (EDIT: the 11:30 is a soft start time to allow for border crossing buffer)

2:30 Arrive at Pacific Coliseum (park in Gate 6 for $25)

2:30-3:30 Wait for doors to open

3:30 Enter Pacific Coliseum

5:00-10:00 Enjoy the game

10:00-11:00 Drive and arrive at border (Pacific Highway)

11:00-1:30 Drive and arrive back in Seattle


This is my tenative plan. A few questions that I have specifically is:

Is arriving 1 hour before doors opening (2.5 hours before event start) too much/little time? I'm just worried about the parking lot filling up.

How much should parking be? I've read that it's about $25. Is that the case? If so, is it also the whole day?

How smooth should crossing the border that day (Saturday around 11pm) be?

These are all my questions but if there's any additional feedback/advice please let me know!

I used it last year to help me get through a tough time and haven't been able to fully pay it off. Working on it though. 

Well, now I'm having a reallyyy slim month. Like, I'm sweating being able to have groceries this month, kind of slim. I'm going to be able to pay rent and MAYBE my phone bill. But that's it. Not groceries, not gas, not the car insurance. Nothing. 

What's a credit card I can get fast with bad credit that can help me get through this? 

(Also note: I have a second job that starts next month, so I'll actually be able to pay it off. Im not digging nyself too deep. I just need something to help me in the meantime with groceries and gas).

Please don't roast me in the comments. I'm working hard to improve my finances and life.

1lpgbrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1lpgbrv/how_i_accidentally_discovered_a_social_skill_that/,How I accidentally discovered a social skill that changed everything,"i just wanna share something that happened to me by pure accident. something simple but kinda powerful that made a big difference in how people treat me and how i connect with them

so i got a job at this electronics store as a sales rep, wasn‚Äôt my dream job or anything just something to get me going. to be honest i didn‚Äôt really care about it much at first. i wasn‚Äôt trying to be the best, i didn‚Äôt care about the products or hitting sales targets or any of that. it showed too. my performence sucked and i didn‚Äôt bother learning anything extra

there was this guy, senior sales, who clearly didn‚Äôt like me from day one. no clue why, maybe because he had to train me or something. and i didn‚Äôt like him back either lol. we just didn‚Äôt click at all

then one day i got lucky and made this huge sale. total fluke, customer came in already ready to buy. but after that, the store manager called me in and said something like ‚Äúthat was impressive, especially for someone new. i think you‚Äôve got potential here, looks like you‚Äôre learning fast‚Äù

that hit me harder than i expected

like i knew it wasn‚Äôt some genius sale, but hearing someone believe in me, even just a little, kinda woke something up in me. after that i actually started trying. i learned the product info, watched how others were selling, and started caring more about improving. and i did. slowly, my sales got better

but then on break one day i just sat there thinking like‚Ä¶ what changed? what made me suddenly start giving a damn about this job?

and it clicked. it was that compliment. those simple words from my manager. they made me wanna live up to what he said. i wanted to prove him right. and that‚Äôs when i realized something‚Äîbeing seen in a positive light by someone else can change your whole attitude. it‚Äôs wild

so i started wondering what would happen if i did the same for others

a few days later i noticed the cleaning guy around the store, always looked tired, barely talked to anyone, just doing his thing like nobody noticed. but i watched how much effort he put in, how clean he kept the place. so i waited till he finished up and said something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing a great job man, honestly wish more people were that honest with their work‚Äù

and dude his face just changed. like completely. he smiled‚Äîgenuinely smiled‚Äîand not just that, he started moving with more energy after that, looked happier, even started talking to me more. i didn‚Äôt expect that at all from just saying one small honest thing

so then i thought ok let me try that with the senior sales guy too. one shift he handled this really annoying customer like a pro, closed the deal like it was nothing. no one said anything ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs kinda expected of him. but i walked up and told him ‚Äú that was smooth, guy was stubborn but you handled it perfectly. respect.‚Äù

he looked at me like he thought i was joking or being sarcastic, but then after a second he just said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù and it felt different. like it actually landed

after that he started being a bit more chill with me. i even asked him out for coffee one time to learn from him a bit and he actually dropped some really helpful tips. helped me close more deals too. and i made sure to tell the manager that he was the one who gave me those tips, didn‚Äôt take the credit for myself. and i could tell he appreciated that

from then on he became my biggest supporter at work. always sharing stuff with me, teaching me things, even hanging out outside of work. it‚Äôs wild how that one moment changed everything between us

anyway what i learned from all this is that compliments‚Äîreal ones, not fake or shallow ones‚Äîcan literally change someone‚Äôs day or even their life. not because you‚Äôre trying to get something out of it, but because being seen feels good. being acknowledged feels good. and people wanna live up to the version of themselves that you see in them

so no i‚Äôm not saying be fake or flatter everyone just to be liked. i‚Äôm saying pay attention. look for the effort people put in that others don‚Äôt notice. see the version of them they‚Äôre trying to become, and tell them you see it

don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúnice shirt,‚Äù say ‚Äú your style‚Äôs actually dope, you‚Äôve got good taste.‚Äù don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúgood job,‚Äù say ‚Äúyou handled that like a pro, i learned something just watching you‚Äù

that‚Äôs it really. if you start doing that consistently‚Äînot to manipulate, but because you mean it‚Äîyou‚Äôll be surprised how people start opening up around you

that‚Äôs the one social skill i accidentally learned, and i‚Äôm glad i did",32,1751411219.0,motivation,2,1.0,False

Always check their official website before writing, as prompts are subject to change annually!

# Prompt 1 (100 words or fewer)

**As you seek admission to Dartmouth \[Class of 20XX\], what aspects of the college‚Äôs academic program, community, and/or campus environment attract your interest? How is Dartmouth a good fit for you?**

**Sample Essay:**  
*Dartmouth‚Äôs commitment to undergraduate research particularly draws me, especially within the Department of Earth Sciences, where I hope to study glacier dynamics. I‚Äôm excited by the Opportunities for Environmental Field Research-funded excursions and the ‚ÄúSophomore Bridge‚Äù program that fosters early academic inquiry. Beyond academics, Dartmouth‚Äôs tight-knit D-Plan community and student-led Outing Club align with my love for collaborative adventure and lifelong learning. The College Green‚Äôs frequent impromptu discussions reflect the kind of intellectual curiosity and camaraderie I value. At Dartmouth, I‚Äôm eager not just to learn but to belong to a campus that balances academic challenge with genuine connection and exploration.*

# Prompt 2 ‚Äì Option A (250 words or fewer)

**There is a Quaker saying: Let your life speak. Describe the environment in which you were raised and the impact it has had on the person you are today.**

**Sample Essay:**  
*I grew up in a family-run diner where every morning began with pancakes and ended with mopping floors. As the eldest sibling, I learned responsibility early‚Äîbalancing trays, managing inventory, and greeting customers by name. The diner wasn‚Äôt just a business; it was a community hub where people shared stories, celebrated birthdays, or mourned losses over coffee. That environment taught me the value of human connection, adaptability, and humility.*

*Weekends often meant serving meals alongside my grandfather, who would close each shift by thanking staff individually. His gratitude wasn‚Äôt performative; it was genuine acknowledgment of everyone‚Äôs role in making the diner thrive. I absorbed that lesson: respect and recognition create belonging.*

*That sense of community shapes how I see my role in the world. Whether guiding teammates in robotics competitions or mentoring younger students, I prioritize empathy, responsibility, and collaboration. At Dartmouth, I‚Äôd bring these values to group projects, residential life, and campus service initiatives. I believe in letting my life speak through action‚Äîby being someone who notices the small gestures that make a space feel like home.*

# Prompt 2 ‚Äì Option B (250 words or fewer)

**‚ÄúBe yourself,‚Äù Oscar Wilde advised. ‚ÄúEveryone else is taken.‚Äù Introduce yourself.**

**Sample Essay:**  
*I am the student who collects rocks‚Äîliterally. On any hike, I pocket a piece of quartz or basalt, curious about its origin. To most, they‚Äôre stones; to me, they‚Äôre stories of geological time. In my room, labeled containers line a shelf: ‚ÄúAmethyst‚ÄîVermont,‚Äù ‚ÄúSchist‚Äîfrom family camping trip.‚Äù Each specimen reminds me of a place, a memory, a question I still haven‚Äôt answered.*

*But I‚Äôm more than a rock-collector. I‚Äôm a translator for my non-English-speaking aunt, narrating PTA meetings in real-time. I‚Äôm the quarterback who draws play diagrams in the dirt when no whiteboard is available. I‚Äôm the friend who insists on turning off devices during dinner to focus on laughter and conversation.*

*I care about connection between people, places, ideas. Whether it‚Äôs bonding over geology or translating someone‚Äôs lived experience, I‚Äôm drawn to the interplay between curiosity and empathy. At Dartmouth, I‚Äôll carry that translator‚Äôs instinct and that rock hiker‚Äôs wonder into every classroom, trail, and discussion circle. My identity isn‚Äôt defined by a single passion but shaped by a mosaic of curiosities, relationships, and quiet joys.*

# Prompt 3 ‚Äì Choose One of the Following Prompts... (250 words or fewer)

A.¬†¬† ¬†What excites you?

B.¬†¬† ¬†Labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta recommended a life of purpose. ""We must use our lives to make the world a better place to live, not just to acquire things,"" she said. ""That is what we are put on the earth for."" In what ways do you hope to make‚Äîor are you already making‚Äîan impact? Why? How?

C.¬†¬† ¬†In ""Oh, The Thinks You Can Think,"" Dr. Seuss invites us to ""Think and wonder. Wonder and think."" Imagine your anticipated academic major: How does that course of study sync with Dr. Seuss's advice to you?

D.¬†¬† ¬†The social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees have been the focus of Dame Jane Goodall's research for decades. Her understanding of animal behavior prompted the English primatologist to see a lesson for human communities as well: ""Change happens by listening and then starting a dialogue with the people who are doing something you don't believe is right."" Channel Dame Goodall: Tell us about a moment when you engaged in a difficult conversation or encountered someone with an opinion or perspective that was different from your own. How did you find common ground?

E.¬†¬† ¬†Celebrate your nerdy side.

F.¬†¬†¬† ""It's not easy being green‚Ä¶"" was the frequent refrain of Kermit the Frog. How has difference been a part of your life, and how have you embraced it as part of your identity, outlook, or sense of purpose?

G.¬†¬† ¬†Buddy Teevens '79 was a legendary and much-beloved coach at Dartmouth. He often told parents: ""Your son will be a great football player when it's football time, a great student when it's academic time, and a great person all of the time."" If Coach Teevens had said that to you, what would it mean to be ""a great person""?

# Option A: What excites you?

**Sample Essay:**  
*What excites me most is an unpredictable collaboration. Last summer, I joined a community robotics team (made up of engineers, artists, and computer programmers) to build a robot for local competitions. We had no manual, conflicting schedules, and wildly different skill sets. What emerged was not just a functioning robot, but a shared sense of possibility and resilience.*

*I thrived on those late-night brainstorming sessions where solutions came from unexpected directions‚Äîlike painting sensors with nail polish to reduce glare or using music to improve coding focus. The moment our robot performed flawlessly during the final trial, the exhilaration wasn‚Äôt just about success‚Äîit was about collective triumph. That kind of creative fusion excites me more than any solitary achievement.*

*At Dartmouth, I look forward to replicating that dynamic across disciplines‚Äîwhether in a music ensemble that includes engineers, a studio art project with biologists, or group research in the Rockefeller Center. I‚Äôm energized by the unpredictable paths that emerge when diverse minds collaborate, and I hope Dartmouth‚Äôs culture of cross-disciplinary innovation will fuel that spark.*

# Option B: In what ways do you hope to make‚Äîor are you already making‚Äîan impact? Why? How?

**Sample Essay:**  
*As president of my school‚Äôs mental health advocacy group, I‚Äôve worked to destigmatize conversations around student wellbeing. I spearheaded a campaign called ‚ÄúTalk It Out,‚Äù which hosted peer-led drop-in sessions and partnered with counselors to provide resources during midterms. The impact was visible‚Äîabsenteeism decreased by 15%, and students began approaching us for help rather than hiding their struggles.*

*This work taught me that impact isn‚Äôt always sweeping; sometimes it‚Äôs about offering sustained support. I hope to scale this model at Dartmouth by collaborating with counseling services, wellness peer groups, and residential communities to create a peer navigator system. My goal is to ensure no student feels alone, especially during high-pressure moments.*

*Impact matters most when it‚Äôs built on empathy and sustained effort. I‚Äôm committed to weaving conversations about mental health into everyday campus life‚Äîon trails, in dorms, and around dining tables‚Äîso that caring becomes a natural part of our shared culture.*

# Option C: Channel Dame Goodall: Tell us about a moment when you engaged in a difficult conversation or encountered someone with an opinion or perspective that was different from your own. How did you find common ground?

**Sample Essay:**  
*Last year, I engaged in a heated debate with a friend who believed standardized tests were the only fair measure of academic potential. I argued that socioeconomic privilege skewed outcomes. She countered that standardized metrics were objective and equitable.*

*Instead of continuing to clash, I invited her to co-lead a study session exploring test performance across different socioeconomic groups. We researched together, interviewed peers, and presented our findings at a school assembly. Ultimately, we concluded that standardized tests can provide data, but they can‚Äôt measure grit, creativity, or context‚Äîand that these qualities matter just as much.*

*The experience transformed our argument into collaboration. It taught me to listen without immediately rebutting and to find common ground through shared inquiry. It reminded me that change happens not through confrontation, but through dialogue and willingness to learn.*

# Tips for Writing Dartmouth Essays

1. **Be succinct and specific**: Especially for the 100-word ‚Äúwhy Dartmouth‚Äù essay‚Äîchoose two or three precise details.
2. **Show your individuality**: In 250 words, let your voice and personality shine through genuine reflection.
3. **Connect experiences to Dartmouth**: Mention specific programs, values, or student communities unique to Dartmouth.
4. **Choose prompts wisely**: Pick options that let you share new aspects of yourself not elsewhere in your application.
5. **Use vivid examples**: Show don‚Äôt tell. Bring anecdotes to life with sensory details and emotion.

# What NOT to Do

* **Don't repeat your Common App essay**: Each [Dartmouth supplemental essay](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/dartmouth-supplemental-essay-examples) should present a fresh dimension of who you are.
* **Avoid clich√©s**: Ditch overused phrases like ‚ÄúI want to make a difference.‚Äù Show *how* you already do.
* **Don't exceed word limits**: Dartmouth enforces them strictly; go under if you can‚Äôt add value.
* **Don‚Äôt neglect editing**: Spelling or grammar errors suggest a lack of care.
* **Avoid generic praise**: Saying ‚ÄúDartmouth is prestigious‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough‚Äîexplain *why* it matters to you.

# Final Thoughts

Dartmouth‚Äôs essays aim to reveal your voice, values, and fit within their close-knit community. Approach each prompt thoughtfully, share personal insight, and connect your story to Dartmouth's unique offerings.
