A ghost in the corner, etched deep somehow
I trace the lines of the table, remember faded smiles
A story whispered in echoes, stretching miles and miles

My heart still remembers the way you used to be
Before the cracks appeared, before the silence set us free

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end
No more chasing shadows, no more wishing you were mine
Just a tear-stained lullaby, as we let go of what was kind

The rain outside mirrors the drops that fall inside my heart
Each memory a stinging reminder of how we fell apart
I see your face in every crowd, a bittersweet, fleeting view
And my laughter, it feels empty, trying hard to forget you

My heart still remembers the way you used to be
Before the cracks appeared, before the silence set us free

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end
No more chasing shadows, no more wishing you were mine
Just a tear-stained lullaby, as we let go of what was kind

Maybe in another life, our paths would truly intertwine
But the chapters closed, the story done, etched in a fragile line
I'll walk away with my broken pieces, scattered on the floor
And finally lock the door to a love that's here no more

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end
No more chasing shadows, no more wishing you were mine
Just a tear-stained lullaby, as we let go of what was kind

Goodbye to love, goodbye to us...

1m6yjut,https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaGoPlaces/comments/1m6yjut/what_is_the_most_beautiful_street_in/,What is the most beautiful street in Carmel-by-the-Sea?,"I just got back from an incredible day trip exploring Carmel-by-the-Sea, and I have to share my experience on Ocean Avenue, which is hands down the most enchanting street in this charming coastal town. The street runs from Highway 1 right down to Carmel Beach, offering a perfect blend of shopping, dining, and pure California coastal beauty.

Walking down Ocean Avenue feels like stepping into a fairytale. The street is lined with unique Cypress trees and dotted with Tudor-style architecture that gives it this distinct European village vibe. What really caught my attention were the hidden courtyards and secret passages between buildings ‚Äì there's literally something interesting around every corner.

I was lucky enough to visit as part of a guided tour from San Francisco (more on that later), and our guide shared some fascinating history about the street. Apparently, Ocean Avenue has been the heart of Carmel since the early 1900s, when artists and writers first started settling in the area. You can still feel that creative spirit today in the numerous art galleries and boutiques that line the street.

Some highlights you absolutely can't miss:
- The iconic Pine Inn at the corner of Ocean and Monte Verde
- Carmel Plaza's upscale shopping
- The charming coffee shops with outdoor seating
- Local art galleries featuring California artists
- The breathtaking ocean view at the bottom of the street

Pro tip: The best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon when the lighting is perfect for photos and the crowds are thinner. I visited as part of a full-day tour from San Francisco (you can book it here: https://athometouch.com/Monterey), which was perfect because it included stops at other must-see spots like the 17-Mile Drive and Monterey.

What makes Ocean Avenue truly special is how it captures everything that makes Carmel unique ‚Äì the architecture, the artistic heritage, the natural beauty, and the small-town charm. It's not just a street; it's an experience that represents the heart and soul of Carmel-by-the-Sea.

If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend taking a guided tour. Our guide shared so many interesting details about the architecture and history that I would have missed on my own. Plus, having transportation taken care of meant I could fully focus on enjoying the experience rather than worrying about parking (which can be tricky in Carmel).

The street is particularly magical during sunset when the ocean view at the bottom of Ocean Avenue creates this incredible golden glow. Make sure to walk all the way down to Carmel Beach ‚Äì the view of the sunset over the Pacific is absolutely worth it.

For anyone interested in experiencing Ocean Avenue and the rest of Carmel's charm, I used this tour service: https://athometouch.com/Monterey. It's a great way to see everything in one day without the hassle of driving or parking, and you get tons of interesting background information from the guides.",1,1753240811.0,WannaGoPlaces,0,1.0,False

At my old apartment I used the purple fabuloso to clean them, but they were also like a cheap laminate countertop. The photo I included is after wiping my new counter with fabuloso. 

I put a wet bowl on the counter for like a minute before putting it in the dishwasher, and it left this ring of water on the counter top which can't be wiped away and is definitely soaked into the wood, I'm sure it will dry, but I'm worried about what other liquids would be soaked up (like raw chicken juice) if they touch the counter. I'm not gonna like cut raw chicken directly on my counter, but I'm sure I'll accidentally drop a piece off my cutting board at some point. I'm not much of a clean freak and don't really care about the wet circle as long as it dries, but I just don't wanna accidentally get salmonella from my counter soaking it up.

The coffee pot's making that gurgling sound again, folks. Always happens around this time of night ‚Äì like it's trying to tell me something through the percolation. I've learned to pay attention to these small disturbances during the late hours. Sometimes they're mechanical issues, sometimes they're atmospheric pressure changes, and sometimes... well, sometimes they're something else entirely.

It's now approaching one-thirty in the morning, and the calls haven't stopped coming in. I've got a stack of emails here that's growing taller by the minute, all from people who work in the quiet corners of our cultural institutions. Seems like Grace and Victor's stories have opened a floodgate of experiences that people have been keeping to themselves for years.

But there's one message that arrived just moments ago that I knew I had to share with you tonight. It came through our secure submission portal ‚Äì the one we use for particularly sensitive stories ‚Äì and it's from someone who works in perhaps the most secure library environment in the country.

The sender identifies herself only as S.K., and she works at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. For those who've never been there, we're talking about the largest library in the world, housing over 170 million items across three massive buildings. But more importantly for tonight's discussion, it's home to some of the most restricted and carefully preserved documents in human history.

S.K. works in what she calls ""the deep storage facility"" ‚Äì areas of the Jefferson Building that most visitors never see, where the most valuable and fragile materials are kept under museum-quality conditions. Security clearances, biometric scanners, climate-controlled vaults that can only be opened by two people working in tandem. This is where they keep the documents that are literally irreplaceable.

But sometimes, even in the most secure environments, the past finds a way to make its presence known.

Here's what S.K. sent me:

""Mr. Cronkite,

I heard your show tonight while working a late shift in the Asian Collections preservation vault. Victor's story about the breathing in the ventilation system struck a nerve ‚Äì we've been having similar issues down here, though what I experienced goes far beyond mysterious sounds.

My name is Sophie, and I'm 27 years old. I've been working as an archival preservation specialist at the Library of Congress for four years now. I have security clearance to access Level 7 restricted materials ‚Äì documents so rare and valuable that they're kept in individual climate-controlled compartments, some of which haven't been opened in decades.

Three months ago, I was assigned to conduct a condition assessment on a collection of documents from the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam, dating from 1802 to 1945. These materials came to the Library through a complex diplomatic arrangement in 1978, and they've been in deep storage ever since. Imperial edicts, personal correspondence from Emperor Minh Mang, court records written on traditional paper with lacquered seals still intact.

The collection is housed in Vault C-47, six floors below ground level in the Jefferson Building. To access it, I need to pass through four separate security checkpoints, including a biometric scanner that reads both fingerprints and retinal patterns. The vault itself is a room about the size of a large closet, with humidity maintained at exactly 35% and temperature held constant at 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

The lighting in these vaults is motion-activated LED, designed to minimize exposure to harmful spectrums while providing adequate illumination for detailed work. There's no outside communication once you're sealed inside ‚Äì electromagnetic shielding prevents cell phone signals, and there's no internet connection. Just you, the documents, and the soft hum of the environmental controls.

I went down to Vault C-47 on a Tuesday evening in late September. The building was nearly empty ‚Äì just security staff and a few researchers with special after-hours access working in the main reading rooms. I prefer doing my preservation assessments during off-hours because there are fewer vibrations from foot traffic, and the building's environmental systems run more steadily.

The vault door is a massive thing, maybe three inches thick, with a handle that requires both my keycard and a physical key turned simultaneously. As I approached that evening, I noticed something odd. The handle was wet.

Not just damp from condensation ‚Äì actually wet, as if someone with dripping hands had just grabbed it. In an environment maintained at 35% humidity, this was unusual enough to make me pause.

I examined the handle more closely with my flashlight and saw something that made my stomach drop. Clear fingerprints, still wet, covering the entire surface of the handle. Full handprints, as if someone had grabbed it with both hands and held on.

The thing is, according to the access logs, I was the first person to enter that vault in six weeks. The previous visitor had been Dr. Martinez from the Asian Studies department, and that had been for a routine security inspection, not document handling.

I dried off the handle and opened the vault, checking the humidity and temperature readings before entering. Everything was normal ‚Äì environment stable, no signs of moisture intrusion, air filtration system functioning perfectly.

The Nguyen Dynasty documents are stored in fifteen custom-made archival boxes, each one equipped with its own humidity monitoring system. I began my assessment with Box 1, which contains imperial correspondence from 1820-1835.

I was about fifteen minutes into my work when I heard it. A sound like water dripping, very slow and rhythmic. Drip... drip... drip... I looked around the small vault, but there was no visible water source. The sound seemed to be coming from above, from the direction of the air circulation system.

I continued working, but the dripping sound persisted. And after about twenty minutes, I noticed something else. The documents I was examining ‚Äì 200-year-old papers that should have been completely dry ‚Äì felt slightly damp to the touch.

This was alarming enough that I immediately checked the humidity monitors. All readings were normal, exactly where they should be. But the papers continued to feel damp, and the dripping sound was getting more frequent.

That's when I noticed the footprints.

On the pristine white floor of the vault, there were wet footprints leading from the door to the document storage area. Bare feet, small, like those of a young woman or teenager. The prints were fresh ‚Äì I could see individual toe marks clearly defined in the moisture.

I followed the trail with my eyes and realized they led directly to Box 7, which contained personal items and correspondence from the imperial court's female quarters. Documents written by the wives and daughters of the emperors, poetry, personal letters, records of daily life in the Forbidden Purple City of Hue.

I opened Box 7 with trembling hands. The documents inside were not just damp ‚Äì they were soaking wet, as if they'd been submerged in water. But when I lifted them out, they were completely dry to the touch. It was like looking at wet paper while feeling dry paper, a sensory disconnect that made me question my own perception.

As I examined the documents more closely, I noticed something written in the margin of one of the letters. Modern pencil writing, in English, in handwriting I didn't recognize:

'I am still here. They promised to remember me.'

I checked that document against our digital catalog. According to our records, that margin had been blank when the item was last photographed for digitization three years ago.

The dripping sound was becoming more insistent now, and I could see water beginning to pool on the floor around my feet, though I couldn't determine where it was coming from. The environmental controls showed no irregularities, but my work area was getting noticeably wetter.

I decided to expedite my assessment and move to the final boxes, but as I reached for Box 15, I heard something that stopped me cold.

Crying.

Soft, heartbroken sobbing, coming from somewhere inside the vault. A young woman's voice, crying with the kind of grief that comes from profound loss. The sound echoed off the walls despite the acoustic dampening built into the vault's construction.

I stood perfectly still, listening, trying to locate the source of the sound. It seemed to be coming from the documents themselves, as if the papers were weeping.

Then I heard words. Spoken in Vietnamese, which I don't understand, but the emotional content was unmistakable. Pleading, desperate, the voice of someone trying to make themselves understood across a vast distance.

I grabbed my phone to try to record the voice, forgetting that there was no signal in the vault. But as I raised the phone, the crying stopped abruptly. The silence that followed was somehow worse than the weeping had been.

That's when I saw her.

Reflected in the black screen of my phone, standing directly behind me, was a young Vietnamese woman in traditional imperial court dress. She couldn't have been more than sixteen or seventeen, with long black hair and eyes that held a depth of sadness I'd never seen before.

I spun around, but there was no one there. The vault was empty except for me and the documents. But when I looked back at my phone screen, she was still there in the reflection, and now she was pointing at Box 15.

I opened the box she was indicating and found a collection of personal letters written by Princess Ngoc Lan, the youngest daughter of Emperor Minh Mang. She had died in 1838 at the age of seventeen, according to the documentation, but the cause of death was listed simply as 'grief illness' ‚Äì a term that could mean anything from tuberculosis to heartbreak.

The letters were written to her brother, Prince Canh, who had been sent away from court for political reasons. In them, she begged him to return, described her loneliness, expressed her fear that she would be forgotten after her death. The final letter, dated just days before she died, contained a line that made my hands shake:

'I will wait here among my words until someone remembers to look for me.'

As I read this, the water on the floor began to recede, the dripping sound faded, and the oppressive humidity in the vault returned to normal. But written in the condensation on the inside of the vault door, in the same modern handwriting I'd seen in the margins, were new words:

'Thank you for reading my letters. Please don't let them forget me again.'

I finished my assessment quickly and sealed the vault. When I checked the access logs the next morning, they showed that the vault had been opened twice that evening ‚Äì once when I entered, and once again at 3:17 AM, twenty minutes after I'd left the building.

The security cameras for that level were mysteriously corrupted for a twelve-hour period that night.

But here's what really haunts me, Mr. Cronkite. I've been back to that vault six times since then for various projects. Each time, I find new writing in the margins of Princess Ngoc Lan's letters. Not historical additions ‚Äì modern notes, in English, describing her life in the court, her relationships with her family, details about daily life in imperial Vietnam that aren't recorded anywhere else in our collections.

It's as if she's continuing to tell her story, adding to the historical record because she knows that someone is finally paying attention.

The latest addition, which I found just last week, simply said: 'My story matters. All of our stories matter. Please help them understand.'

I've started advocating for a full digitization project of the Nguyen Dynasty collection, with special emphasis on the documents from the women's quarters. My supervisors are puzzled by my sudden passionate interest in 19th-century Vietnamese court records, but they've approved preliminary funding for the project.

I think Princess Ngoc Lan is still trying to ensure that the women of her time aren't forgotten by history. That their voices are preserved and heard, even if it takes nearly two centuries for someone to listen.

But I'm also starting to worry about the other collections in our deep storage vaults. How many other voices are down there, waiting in the darkness for someone to remember they exist? How many stories are being told to empty rooms, hoping that eventually, someone will come to listen?

Last night, I heard crying coming from three different vaults on Level 7. And this morning, I found wet handprints on the handles of doors that haven't been opened in months.

I think they're all trying to tell us something, Mr. Cronkite. All these preserved voices from the past. And I'm starting to think that our job as archivists isn't just to preserve their documents ‚Äì it's to make sure their stories continue to be told.

Sincerely, Sophie""

Sophie, I want you to know that your work matters more than you might realize. What you're experiencing in those vaults isn't just a supernatural phenomenon ‚Äì it's a reminder of the responsibility we bear to the voices from the past. Every document in those collections represents a life lived, a story told, a person who hoped their words would outlast their physical existence.

I did some research on Princess Ngoc Lan after receiving your message, and what I found was troubling. Despite being the daughter of one of Vietnam's most significant emperors, there are virtually no English-language historical records about her life. Her existence is mentioned in passing in a few academic papers, but her voice, her perspective, her experiences ‚Äì they've been largely lost to time.

Until now.

If she's indeed continuing to add to the historical record through those margin notes, then you may be witnessing something unprecedented ‚Äì a collaboration between the living and the dead to ensure that forgotten stories are finally told.

But Sophie, I have to ask you to be careful down there in those vaults. The wet handprints, the crying from multiple locations ‚Äì it sounds like you may have awakened something larger than just one lonely princess. You might want to document everything you're experiencing and consider sharing it with your supervisors, regardless of how it might sound.

Because sometimes the best way to help the dead find peace is to ensure their stories reach the living.

The wind's picking up again outside the station, and I can hear it whistling through the transmitter cables. There's something almost musical about it tonight, like voices carried on the air from very far away. Makes me wonder what stories the wind might be trying to tell, what messages it might be carrying from places where the past still lives and breathes.

We've got more tales from the stacks coming your way, including a rather disturbing account from a book cart that seems to travel through library halls of its own accord, and a story about the color of ink that refuses to dry.

Keep those coffee cups full and your radios close, folks. We're only just scratching the surface of the mysteries that dwell in our temples of knowledge.

1m6yana,https://i.redd.it/b643qe3rijef1.jpeg,Who‚Äôs got the lowest grades at Stuyvesant High School?,"My thoughts on my transcript and the school are these. My thoughts on funding is that Stuyvesant should have ALL of Brooklyn Tech‚Äôs endowment money, the whole shebang. Stuy is so obviously Hogwarts School of Magic or Umbrella Academy, and it should be a more formal school with the houses and magic hat to boot. Nobody after Stuy ‚Äò04 knows what the school was like before 9/11, but my freshman year was House Gryphindor, Phil, Eric and myself all day long for biology, sequential I, badminton, tumbling, picknicking in the park, history and skipping across the bridge and down the steps to the west side highway home. Stuy is the haunted mansion on the hill: Miyazaki, Alfred Hitchcock, any Japanese slice of life such as Ano Hana We Saw That Day (the Japanese don‚Äôt want me speaking their language sorry, but they pay for my trips), Attack on Titan, the cute one about the concert pianist, Demon Slayer, not Bleach or Naruto unless you‚Äôre ‚Äò04, any Western, and DC had this covered. You are the protagonist in a magic story, Glinda the Good Witch granted your wish, but post-9/11 was more like going to school at LaGuardia airport. Hufflepuffs, our extraverted rejected cutie pies go to Harvard College, and I didn‚Äôt meet any until the end of senior year. You‚Äôre then stunned. 

The school would make way more sense if people stuck to their freshman year park friends until the end. If you‚Äôre not in the park with someone for lunch at least once, they are NOT YOUR FRIENDS. And you are not going to similar colleges. Teitel, our principal, and girlfriend, Muggles. The Jewish students are Muggles. Indians: Slytherin. Chinese: mostly Hufflepuff, to be honest. They will blow you away with interesting Cornell acceptances. You don‚Äôt find out about these people until senior year. As far as Cornell, I‚Äôve met a black lady who went there. The Chinese don‚Äôt really lie, they kinda stick together. If you ask, they‚Äôre sorta nice. The Koreans are more cutthroat, Ms. Yoon included, but she was blonde, respectful and funny. Favors boys. She was kinda like Galadriel. J. stern is the male equivalent, a complete mystery. Head of the Math Department: Gandalph or Professor McGonnagal, the top wizard granting you the keys to life. The kind and respectful people at Stuyvesant get overwhelmed a lot. Donald Trump: Hufflepuff. Brooklyn, New York might as well be post-Kefka FFVI, and Uber is a chocobo farm. I was #38 or so on the SHSAT. 
1. 88s or lower: An opinion from the teacher that they don‚Äôt want you in the AP track. Teacher resentments. Don‚Äôt get rattled‚ÄîTake the AP anyway, your friends will get very angry. One of my dumb mistakes was not taking AP History. You do not want an assault from the debate teamer taking AP History, because they will beat you to a pulp and draw strange conclusions about your math classes. It‚Äôs not impressive to them that you have two to three math classes. 
2. 90: just getting to know your personality and/or bored. Blowing you off. In another student‚Äôs hands, this would be a 97. 
3. 97: You‚Äôre good enough for a relevant AP. Reluctant to give you 100, that‚Äôs all. A boy would‚Äôve gotten 100. 
4. 100: you had the French lady for French. 
5. 99: never seen one.
6. 92,96: fair and normal grade.
7. The day I bought a graphing calculator was best day of my lifetime.
8. If you want top 20, put down all. Do not put down Harvard College. In all my years including sat loves I‚Äôve never had a good interaction with this school its students or their parents. The sadistic teachers at Stuyvesant believe they‚Äôre Harvard University. 
9. You‚Äôre free to take zero APs or extracurriculars. That‚Äôs what I wanted actually until a Hufflepuff clinger got to me. See that part about only making friends with people who are in the park with you and/or freezing with you early in the morning? The rest of them don‚Äôt know your schedule. I‚Äôm just a kid is a fine excuse. 
10. Euclidean geometry I don‚Äôt remember at all!! Aside from it being a trigonometry rehash‚Ä¶ I probably fell asleep. If it‚Äôs the class I‚Äôm thinking of, this is the one where where you prove all of your favorite theorems in order. But I can skim Math papers and so can my pet. She likes stationery and writing greeting cards. Don‚Äôt get pets. 
11. BC Calc was nicer. I would‚Äôve moved that down to junior year, if at all. 
12. Including Classical Lit, where Ms. Yoon lowers self esteem, I didn‚Äôt like my English classes. I read much more, even in my free time, in Catholic school. As a freshman, I entered the school with a perfect SAT Verbal waiting for my tiny hands and a sucky math score. As far as I know, nobody needs AP English, and they should stop bragging about it. God, the AP English people are pompous. 
13. Just take the AP Economics classes, AP Psychology, and people won‚Äôt be as concerned. 
14. Philosophy: sadistic abuser‚Ä¶ nervous Hufflepuff breakdown. Fingers bleeding, 3 hours of homework. On the vague plus side, I remember what I read mostly. People will deeply hate you in your 20s. What they will hear coming out of your mouth is Hermione Granger. Abusive people abuse Freud. It‚Äôs too much knowledge to take home. Read the texts, don‚Äôt do the homework, take home a 0. 
15. Mr. Mott: sadistic abuser. Depressive episode waiting for you. Snap, hand in strong 75s or below to the black people, write trash, and the Chinese, too, and call it. Do not take feedback from English teachers.
16. The school needs two top 15% psychiatrists, like an MD, for therapy. By junior year, I was having night terrors and up until 5am playing video games. Then, my parents divorced. The borderline personality disordered kids at the school need advice. Ms. Kornhauser or whoever she is suckage if schedules are getting posted publicly. 
17. As far as race, I don‚Äôt care. If you‚Äôre mixed race, light-skinned, bouncy, or otherwise, pick a side and make friends with either the Chinese or the Koreans and call it day. Avoid Indians.
18. My last regret is not failing more classes or withdrawing. If what you‚Äôre hearing from a teacher is blah-blah-blah-pit-pat-womp-womp, it‚Äôs genuinely blah-blah-blah-pit-pat-womp-womp:
19. AP Computer Sci, I can‚Äôt comment on because I didn‚Äôt know them. 
20. Coffee: fine. Chinese tea: good. Dark chocolate: better. Spirulina: bonuses. Try reading glasses for yourself.
21. Latinos and the acting people cheat. Wherever the heck your battle axe bestie wants to go, apply there. In my case, it was MIT and Columbia. Phil was hopefully at Columbia. In exchange, they should have put down Brooklyn College, Stonybrook University, all the SUNYs, CUNYs, FIT, and made a safe decision. If I had known Olga and perhaps Amanda better, I would‚Äôve dragged them to check out SBU with me.

The only place to go to after Stuy is medical school, for obstetrics, general practitioner, or psychiatry, in my opinion.

In short, do what your freshman year friends do. In roughly 20 years, the people who hate you now and think you‚Äôre stupid and ugly still will. When I read Neil Gaiman‚Äôs Poison Ivy comic, it was reassuring and so is the Harlequin one. American Gods: nice novel from a condescending psychopath. My reading list is Nabokov and ancient Italian, graphic novels for rest, the usual Catholic school girl fare. I eat okonomiyaki, chicken Milanese, and my next trip is on the way. Goodbye. Life ruined by Stuyvesant High School. I‚Äôm tired of Ecuadorians copying me. Last piece of advice: read the yearbooks!! If I‚Äôd taken AP Psychology, I‚Äôd at least be on SNAP right away. The best episode of my this is my heavenly life tv show will involve getting my SBU degree rescinded. ",1,1753240031.0,u_orange_moon,0,1.0,False

The wind's picking up something fierce out here tonight, folks. I can hear it whistling through the pine trees surrounding our little station, rattling the windows like restless spirits trying to get in. Perfect weather for the stories we're about to share. You're listening to WNMR ‚Äì Nocturnal Mysteries Radio, and I'm your host, Edward Cronkite, broadcasting live from our transmitter station deep in the Blackwood Forest.

It's just past eleven on this October evening, and my coffee's grown cold while sorting through the mountain of letters, emails, and voice messages you've sent in response to last week's call. I asked for stories from those who work in the places where knowledge sleeps ‚Äì our libraries, archives, and repositories of human memory. The response has been... overwhelming.

Tonight, we're diving into something special. Tales from the keepers of knowledge, those brave souls who tend to our books and manuscripts long after the rest of us have gone home. Because let me tell you something ‚Äì when the fluorescent lights dim and the last patron shuffles out, these repositories of human knowledge take on a life of their own.

Our first story tonight comes from Grace. She sent me a handwritten letter ‚Äì and yes, people still do that ‚Äì postmarked from Chicago, Illinois. Her handwriting is precise, methodical, the kind you'd expect from someone who's spent years cataloging rare volumes. But there's a tremor in some of the later lines, a slight shake that speaks to something that shook her to her core.

Grace works at the Newberry Library, one of Chicago's most prestigious research institutions. For those unfamiliar, the Newberry isn't your typical public library. It's a fortress of rare books and manuscripts, a place where scholars come to commune with documents that have survived centuries. Grace has been there for seven years, working her way up from part-time shelver to full-time rare books librarian. She loves her job, she says. Or rather, she did.

Let me read you what Grace shared:

""Dear Mr. Cronkite,

I've been listening to your show for months now, usually while I'm doing late-night inventory work. There's something comforting about your voice echoing through the empty halls of the library, making the darkness feel less... occupied. But after what happened three weeks ago, I can't listen anymore. Every time I hear your voice, I'm reminded of that night, and I start hearing other sounds. Sounds that shouldn't exist.

I need to tell someone who might understand. Someone who won't immediately suggest I see a therapist or take a vacation. Someone who knows that some experiences can't be explained away with logic and medical degrees.

It was a Tuesday night in late September. I remember because we'd just received a new acquisition ‚Äì a collection of 18th-century personal letters from a recently deceased estate in Lake Forest. Beautiful pieces, some still sealed with wax. The kind of discovery that makes a librarian's heart race.

I was working late, cataloging the new materials in our climate-controlled rare books room on the fourth floor. The Newberry closes to the public at five, but staff often stay much later. The building is enormous ‚Äì six floors of reading rooms, offices, and storage areas that date back to 1893. During the day, it bustles with researchers and students. But after hours, it's a different creature entirely.

The rare books room where I work is accessed through a series of keycard-controlled doors. Security is tight ‚Äì we're talking millions of dollars worth of irreplaceable documents. The room itself is kept at exactly 68 degrees with 45% humidity. No natural light ever touches these materials. It's illuminated by soft, warm LED panels that cast everything in a golden glow.

I was alone that night, which wasn't unusual. Dr. Patterson, our head curator, had left around seven, and Janet from acquisitions had gone home with a migraine around eight-thirty. The security guard, Martinez, was making his rounds on the lower floors. I could hear his radio crackling occasionally through the building's intercom system.

I was working at station seven, one of our examination tables positioned near the 16th-century manuscript section. Beautiful volumes bound in leather and vellum, some with brass clasps that have developed the most gorgeous patina over the centuries. The smell in that room ‚Äì it's intoxicating. Paper and leather and time itself, if time has a scent.

I'd been photographing and describing a series of letters when I first heard it. The sound of pages turning.

Now, that might not seem strange in a library, but remember ‚Äì I was alone, and these books don't just get handled casually. Each one requires specific protocols, gloves, proper lighting, careful positioning. You don't just flip through a 400-year-old manuscript like it's a paperback novel.

The sound was coming from section G-7, about thirty feet to my left. Slow, deliberate page turns. The kind of careful, reverent handling you'd expect from an experienced researcher. I could even hear the whisper of aged paper against paper, that distinctive rustle that old books make.

'Hello?' I called out, thinking maybe Martinez had come up to check on me. 'Dr. Patterson?'

Silence.

I waited a moment, then returned to my work. Old buildings make noises, right? Settling foundations, temperature changes, the HVAC system cycling. The Newberry is over a century old ‚Äì it probably has sounds I haven't even discovered yet.

But then it happened again. Same deliberate rhythm. Page turn, pause, page turn, pause. Like someone was reading, taking their time to absorb each page before moving on.

I stood up from my workstation and walked toward section G-7. The golden LED lighting cast long shadows between the stacks, creating an almost honeyed atmosphere that should have been comforting but somehow felt heavy, expectant.

As I approached the area where the sound had originated, I noticed something odd. The air felt different. Thicker. And there was a smell underneath the usual library scents ‚Äì something organic and slightly sweet, like flowers that had been pressed between pages for decades.

Section G-7 houses some of our most valuable medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. I know every volume in that section by heart. As I approached, I could see them all in their proper places, standing at attention in their custom-fitted boxes and protective sleeves.

But then I saw it.

One volume had been removed from its box and was lying open on the reading rest we keep positioned between the stacks. It was the Rosetti Illuminated Hours, a book of hours from approximately 1480, decorated with the most exquisite miniature paintings you've ever seen. Angels and saints rendered in gold and lapis lazuli, their faces so detailed you'd swear they were watching you.

The book was open to a page I knew well ‚Äì a depiction of the Resurrection, showing Christ emerging from the tomb while angels looked on. But as I got closer, I noticed something that made my blood run cold.

The page was turning.

Not a fast flip, but a slow, careful lift of the edge, as if invisible fingers were gently coaxing the ancient vellum to reveal the next illustration. I watched, paralyzed, as the page completed its turn and settled against the rest of the book with the softest whisper.

Now it was open to the page showing the Angel of Death, a figure in black robes holding an hourglass, standing over a field of lilies.

I stood there for what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, waiting for my rational mind to provide an explanation. Air current from the ventilation system. Some kind of static electricity. A slight vibration from the building's infrastructure. Anything.

But as I watched, the book opened to a page I'd never seen before. And that's impossible, because I've cataloged every page of the Rosetti Hours. I've photographed them, described them, studied them under magnification. I know that book like I know my own heartbeat.

This page was different. The illumination style was similar, but the content... The content was a single image of a woman in a blue dress, sitting at a desk surrounded by books. She had dark hair pulled back in a bun, and she was wearing glasses. Modern glasses, not anything that would have existed in 1480.

She looked exactly like me.

I'm not talking about a general resemblance. I'm talking about an exact likeness, down to the small scar above my left eyebrow from when I fell off my bike as a kid. The woman in the illustration was even wearing the same green cardigan I had on that night.

But here's the thing that still makes my hands shake when I think about it ‚Äì the woman in the illustration was looking up from her work, looking directly out of the page, and her mouth was moving. I could see her lips forming words, over and over again.

I leaned closer, trying to make out what she was saying, and that's when I heard it. Not with my ears, but somehow directly in my mind, like a whisper that bypassed my hearing entirely:

'Don't leave me here alone.'

I jerked backward so fast I knocked over the reading rest, sending the book tumbling to the floor. The sound of it hitting the carpet was like a gunshot in the silence. As I scrambled to pick it up, my hands shaking so badly I could barely function, the book fell open to its proper page ‚Äì the Angel of Death illustration.

There was no mysterious woman. No modern dress or glasses or scar above an eyebrow. Just the traditional medieval imagery I'd seen hundreds of times before.

I carefully closed the book and returned it to its protective box, my hands trembling the entire time. Then I gathered my things, locked up the room, and left the building. I didn't finish my cataloging work. I didn't even turn off the lights properly. I just ran.

The next morning, I came in early to check on the Rosetti Hours. Everything was exactly as it should be. The book was properly stored, all the pages accounted for, no damage from its fall. Dr. Patterson complimented me on completing the previous night's inventory so efficiently. According to the work logs, I'd finished cataloging the entire new acquisition and had even completed the preliminary condition reports on twelve additional volumes.

I had no memory of doing any of that work.

But here's what really haunts me, Mr. Cronkite ‚Äì three weeks later, I'm still hearing pages turning. Not just at work, but at home. In my apartment at night, I'll be reading or watching television, and I'll hear that same careful, deliberate rhythm coming from my bedroom. Page turn, pause, page turn, pause.

When I investigate, I never find anything out of place. But sometimes, on my bedside table, I'll find books I don't remember taking out from the library. Books that aren't even in our circulation system. Old volumes with no call numbers, no acquisition stamps, no catalog records.

And sometimes, late at night when I'm lying in bed trying to sleep, I can feel someone watching me. Not threatening, exactly, but... expectant. Like they're waiting for me to read to them, or with them. Like they don't want to be alone with all those words, all those stories, all that accumulated knowledge.

I've started sleeping with the lights on, Mr. Cronkite. Because in the dark, I can hear them clearly now ‚Äì not just one set of pages turning, but dozens. A whole library's worth of books being read by people who are no longer there to read them.

Last night, I woke up to find a piece of paper on my nightstand. Written in my own handwriting, though I have no memory of writing it, were the words: 'The books remember everyone who ever loved them. They don't like to be forgotten.'

I don't know what to do. I love my job, I love those books, but I'm starting to think they love me back in a way that isn't... healthy. In a way that doesn't want to let me go.

If you read this on the air, Mr. Cronkite, please don't use my last name. The Newberry Library is a prestigious institution, and they don't need rumors of hauntings affecting their reputation. But if there are other librarians out there experiencing similar things, I'd like them to know they're not alone.

We're not alone, even when we think we are. Especially when we think we are.

Sincerely, Grace""

Well, Grace, I want you to know that your letter reached me, and more importantly, I believe every word of it. There's something about institutions of learning, especially the old ones, that seems to accumulate more than just knowledge. They accumulate the passion, the dedication, the love that people have poured into those books and documents over the decades.

I did some research after receiving your letter, Grace, and I discovered something interesting about the Newberry Library. In 1952, a librarian named Dorothy Meredith was found deceased at her desk in the rare books room after working late one evening. Natural causes, according to the reports ‚Äì a heart attack brought on by stress. She'd been cataloging a new acquisition of medieval manuscripts.

The interesting thing is, Dorothy was known for her habit of talking to the books while she worked. Colleagues often heard her having full conversations in the rare books room, discussing the history of each piece, commenting on the craftsmanship of the illuminations. They found it charming, if a bit eccentric.

After her death, several staff members reported hearing voices in the rare books room during evening hours. Soft conversations, as if someone was still commenting on the manuscripts. The reports eventually stopped, but they lasted for nearly a year.

Grace, I can't tell you whether what you experienced was Dorothy trying to continue her work, or simply the building holding onto echoes of all the love and dedication that's been poured into it over the decades. But I can tell you this ‚Äì if the books are indeed remembering everyone who ever loved them, then you're in good company.

The fog's rolling in thick tonight, listeners. I can barely see the treeline from the studio window. It's the kind of night when the boundary between our world and whatever lies beyond seems particularly thin. We've got more stories coming your way ‚Äì tales from the archives, from the stacks, from the quiet corners where knowledge sleeps and dreams.

Stay with us. The night is young, and the books are just beginning to whisper their secrets.

We have a shared kitchen/breakroom, and it's typically used by 20-30 people. In this kitchen we have a variety of plates, bowls, coffee cups and other drink ware, and the majority of the set was donated to the office by my company. For the most part, people are considerate and clean up after themselves. However, there are a few (unknown) bad eggs who consistently leave their dirty dishes in the sink. We have a cleaning crew come by on Saturdays, but until then it's up to us to maintain cleanliness in our space. Our collection of dinnerware is small, maybe 8-10 pieces per style (8 plates, 8 bowls etc...), and 9 times out of 10, I find myself having to wash other people's dirty dishes just to have one for my own use. For awhile, I just went ahead and washed ALL the dishes in the sink when it was full because it was NEEDED, not because I wanted to, but because I felt it was the nice thing to do. However, lately I feel like it's gotten out of hand, and quite frankly, I'm fed up. For context, I am one of 3 women, the rest of the building staff are men, so the gender roles may come into play. I've attempted to make a lighthearted joke out of it, like taping little pictures of funny but snarky memes by the sink...but nothing's changed. 

Here's where I may be the asshole: I want to confiscate every dirty dish left in the sink (I'll wash them and keep them in my office and return eventually). Dirty plate? Taken. Your personal coffee cup? Taken. Oh no, there's no more dishes for you to reheat your leftovers? Bummer.

For the past 3 years, I have worked with a very difficult direct report. To give context, this person is smart and has excellent ideas, but a very, very bad attitude and entitlement. I set clear expectations of the role, and they always find something to complain about even about work hours 9-5 (that's our office policy). I have been lenient and even allowed them to work from a coffee shop or home a number of times.  They act as if the world owes everything to them. They always complain about work, despite me adjusting their workload,  shifting priorities, and pretty much catering to them. They are now leaving onto a new role, and I was their reference. I wrote a really good reference for them because I really wanted them to move on. To be frank, managing this person has been extremely difficult, and I really want them to move on. This person is my first direct report, and I admit I have allowed them to walk over me a little bit. This person also takes any feedback as a personal attack, and i have worked with my own manager on how to package feednack to them so it lands well. I am learning to be a better leader and a manager. 

They will be leaving in 2 weeks, and I wonder if I should hint in my farewell note about their entitlement. My friend says it's not worth it, and I should should just keep it short and wish them well. What's your take on this?",3,1753239798.0,managers,15,1.0,False

She is convinced her high blood sugar is 100% related to her stress and pain and not related to her eating habits. She also says prior to living with us her blood sugar wasn't this high (but she didn't check it every day either - actually I checked her meter and she hadn't checked it in a year).

I am a patient person. I get along with everyone. I have had to play referee to hot heads before and I give people the benefit of the doubt - even assume the best of people most of the time. I'm annoyingly optimistic. So I say what I'm about to say with guilt and a sense of failure - my mother in law is the most selfish and meanest mother I've ever met. She is verbally abusive to her son (my husband) almost daily. So she is very difficult to work with. 

So regardless of that - she can't afford assisted living (and neither can we). She wasnt using her oxygen when she was living alone because she was a chain smoker and has experience first hand why oxygen and cigarettes don't mix. She may have also been responsible for burning her last rental down to the ground...

On top of that, she eats poorly. Fast food, pastries, cup o noodles. On top of that, she would leave condiments and jars of food that should have been refrigerated in her cupboards. Her apartment was filled to the brim with dirt, moldy food, an inch of oily dirt from the smoking. Oh and coffee grounds. On the floor, on the sink... (She also has Parkinson's so she has trouble not making a mess.) A pot of food that she cooked and never put away or threw or away. I don't know. Cleaning her apartment out was awful. I tossed most of her food/toiletries because they were so gross. She had a shoe organizer with about 6 pairs of white sneakers which were brown. With dust. No joke or exaggeration. She still tells at us for throwing away her things. Things that I replaced - mostly. I did not replace her perfume because I cannot tolerate perfume (I mean, to the point of vomit inducing migraines and difficulty breathing). 

So here we are 5 months in and we are struggling taking care of her. She hates living here and she makes it known. She says we don't understand how hard it was losing her independence (but we do). Oh we took her car keys away. She doesn't have a driver's license, her car has not been registered for a few years, and she doesn't have any car insurance. Plus, her car is beat up from the multiple poles she has hit in parking lots. She hates us for taking away her keys. Calls us names for it because she is perfectly capable of driving. 

We started off by not imposing too many restrictions. We knew it would be a hard transition for her but we didn't want to be the food police. I didn't realize that she has no concept of carbs. The first day she got up at 6am, she ate 2 large croissants, a muffin, and a banana. She left food out on the counter all the time - mayo, half n half, lunch meat... She also went through a box of 24 k cups of coffee in 3 days. I also caught her beating my Keurig with her fist because it wasn't working properly (too slow). 

Why didn't we cook for her you ask? We did but she would get up at 4am and raid the kitchen. She doesn't wait. She doesn't ask, she demands. She also barged into my bedroom at 7am demanding her pills. (She was taking them incorrectly so we put them in a pill organizer for her). She also shoves food in her pockets or shoves things in her mouth in the kitchen where we can't see her because she doesn't want anyone telling her what she can and can't eat. 

Okay, let her have her way and make her own choices? We tried this. We filled the fridge with the things she said she liked that fell within a low carb, low sodium diet.  But she hated that. Mostly she hates that I replaced her regular microwave popcorn with salt free, smaller portioned bags. And she would just eat 3 at a time so it defeated the purpose. 

She yelled at us about the popcorn so I said fine, give her what she wants - a Kirkland box of popcorn which is 44 bags at 45 carbs each. She ate the whole box in 11 days. She ran out of insulin. And I asked her, how often are you giving yourself a shot - she said Everytime she eats which she said was about 8 times a day. 

We had to take her coffee away. My husband puts enough for one pot in there before he goes to bed and that's all she gets because she was drinking over 10 cups a day and getting coffee grounds everywhere. Now we are to the point that we think we need to take the popcorn away. Or at least only put one out a day so she can't eat 4 bags a day. I even bought the skinny pop which the nutritionalist approved but she yelled at us for getting her fake popcorn...

Did I mention she also blames us for her gaining weight? Her pain levels being higher? I know I don't sound empathetic. My husband and I also have health issues. He has chronic pain from back injuries and I have vestibular neuroitis, migraines, diabetes, gastro issues, nerve compression, and so on. My husband has been my caregiver for a year and he is patient and kind... On Father's Day I had to take him to urgent care. I told her and she said ok - and in the same breath asked if I could take her to get her haircut - mind you, I don't drive often and she already asked him the day before and he said not till Monday and we were on the way to urgent care!! 

She does not have dementia or memory loss so long as she keeps her oxygen levels up. I just don't know what to do. I hide food she shouldn't have. I've tried giving her her own shelf in the fridge with all the foods she likes. I don't nag her about drinking water which she refuses to do - she only drinks coffee, Earl grey tea, and diet coke. 

Okay. Sorry - that was a rant. I'm frustrated. I don't want to be the food police but at what point am I being an irresponsible caregiver by allowing her access to foods she shouldn't eat in the quantities that she is eating? 

Oh also, my autistic son, my husband, and myself get low blood sugar so we cannot eliminate all sugar from the house. And yes, I could get glucose tabs but have you had those, they are gross. And some of my kids safe foods are not diabetic friendly.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a body exfoliator depends on several key features including the type of exfoliant (physical or chemical), the ingredients, the texture, and the overall formulation. Different skin types and needs require different exfoliators, so understanding these features is crucial.

**Type of Exfoliant:** Physical exfoliators use abrasive ingredients to manually scrub away dead skin cells, while chemical exfoliators utilize acids to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells.

Physical exfoliators, such as scrubs with salt, sugar, or microbeads (though microbeads are often avoided due to environmental concerns), provide immediate visible results. They are best for those who prefer a more hands-on approach and want to feel the exfoliation process. Though, they can be too harsh for sensitive skin if not used carefully. Chemical exfoliators containing ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) offer a gentler approach,penetrating deeper into the skin to unclog pores and promote cell turnover.

**Ingredients:** The ingredients in a body exfoliator can significantly impact its effectiveness and suitability for different skin types.

Ingredients like salicylic acid (BHA) are excellent for acne-prone skin due to their ability to penetrate pores and dissolve oil and dead skin cells. Glycolic acid (AHA) is effective for improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Natural ingredients like sugar, salt, coffee grounds, and fruit enzymes (such as papain or bromelain) provide gentler exfoliation and offer additional benefits like antioxidant properties. Look for formulations that combine exfoliating agents with moisturizing ingredients such as shea butter, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to prevent dryness and irritation.

**Texture:** The texture of a body exfoliator affects its ease of use and the level of abrasion it provides.

Scrubs with larger particles offer more intense exfoliation, while finer particles are gentler and suitable for sensitive areas.Gel-based exfoliators are lightweight and easy to spread, making them ideal for daily use. Cream-based exfoliators are often more hydrating and better suited for dry skin. Consider the texture preference based on your skin type and desired level of exfoliation. Such as, a coarser scrub might be preferable for rough areas like elbows and knees, while a finer scrub would be more suitable for the chest and back.

**Formulation:** The overall formulation of a body exfoliator, including its pH level and the presence of additional ingredients, impacts its effectiveness and potential for irritation.

A well-formulated exfoliator will have a pH level that is compatible with the skin's natural pH to minimize irritation. Look for formulations that are free of harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and artificial fragrances, which can cause allergic reactions or skin sensitivities. Some exfoliators also contain antioxidants, vitamins, and other beneficial ingredients that nourish and protect the skin while exfoliating.

Key features of the best body exfoliators for men include:

* Effective exfoliating agents (physical or chemical)
* High-quality and beneficial ingredients
* Appropriate texture for different skin types
* Well-balanced and gentle formulation

## Core Benefits

Using a body exfoliator regularly offers numerous benefits for men's skin, from improved texture and tone to reduced ingrown hairs and breakouts. It's a simple yet effective way to enhance your grooming routine and maintain healthy, radiant skin.

**Improved Skin Texture and Tone:** Regular exfoliation removes the buildup of dead skin cells that can make the skin look dull, rough, and uneven.By sloughing away these dead cells, the exfoliator reveals the fresh, healthy skin underneath, resulting in a smoother, softer, and more radiant complexion. For instance, incorporating a body scrub into your routine 2-3 times a week can help to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of blemishes and discoloration, leading to a healthier overall appearance.

**Reduced Ingrown Hairs:** Exfoliation is particularly beneficial for men who shave or wax their body hair.

By removing dead skin cells that can trap hairs beneath the surface, exfoliation helps to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps. This is because exfoliating before shaving allows the razor to glide smoothly over the skin's surface,minimizing irritation and promoting a closer,cleaner shave. Regularly exfoliating after shaving or waxing also helps to keep the skin clear and prevents new ingrown hairs from forming.

**minimized Breakouts and Clogged Pores:** Exfoliating helps to unclog pores and remove excess oil and impurities that can lead to breakouts and acne.

By removing the barrier of dead skin cells, the exfoliant allows cleansing agents to penetrate deeper into the pores, effectively clearing out dirt, oil, and debris. This is especially vital for areas like the back and chest, which are prone to breakouts due to increased sweat and oil production.Combining exfoliation with a gentle cleanser can further enhance these benefits, leading to clearer, healthier skin.

**Increased Product Absorption:** Exfoliating the skin allows other skincare products, such as moisturizers and serums, to penetrate more effectively.

By removing the layer of dead skin cells, these products can reach the underlying layers of skin more easily, delivering their beneficial ingredients directly where they are needed. This can enhance the effectiveness of your skincare routine and lead to better overall results.

Core Benefits include:

* Improves skin texture and tone
* Reduces ingrown hairs
* Minimizes breakouts and clogged pores
* Increases product absorption

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right body exfoliator and using it correctly can be confusing. Here are some common questions and answers to help you navigate the world of body exfoliation.

**How often should I exfoliate my body?**
The frequency of exfoliation depends on your skin type and the type of exfoliator you are using. Generally, exfoliating 2-3 times per week is sufficient for most men. If you have sensitive skin, start with once a week and gradually increase as tolerated. Avoid over-exfoliating, as this can lead to irritation, dryness, and inflammation.

**can I use a body exfoliator on my face?**
It is generally not recommended to use a body exfoliator on your face, as the skin on the face is much more delicate than the skin on the body. Body exfoliators often contain coarser particles and harsher ingredients that can be too abrasive for facial skin, leading to irritation, redness, and damage. instead, use a facial exfoliator specifically formulated for the face.

**What should I do after exfoliating my body?**
After exfoliating, it is indeed critically important to rinse your skin thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a soft towel. Immediately follow with a moisturizer to replenish any lost moisture and keep your skin hydrated. This helps to prevent dryness, irritation, and flakiness. Look for moisturizers containing ingredients like shea butter, hyaluronic acid, or aloe vera to soothe and hydrate the skin.

**What are the signs of over-exfoliating?**
Signs of over-exfoliating include redness, irritation, dryness, flakiness, sensitivity, and even breakouts. If you experience any of these symptoms, reduce the frequency of exfoliation or switch to a gentler exfoliator. It is indeed also critically important to avoid using other possibly irritating products, such as retinoids or harsh cleansers, while your skin is recovering.

Think about it. If someone is publicly labeled as severely mentally ill, it puts all their claims of government corruption and cover ups into question. Any pro establishment shill could dismiss their claims as delusions from untreated mental illness.

All it would take would be for an agent, disguised as a barista, to slip something into a cup of coffee at the target's regular coffee shop. To provide just one example.

Putin likes to use radiation poison to send a message, it would not be far off to say that the US Government has their own ways of covering up the truth.

Why shoot someone or kill them with radiation when you can destroy their public image and legacy? If they die in the process, be it by their own hands or by some other cause, it adds the bonus of silencing them forever.

## Key Features Analysis

The purse holder hook market in 2025 is characterized by a range of materials, designs, and weight capacities. Understanding the technical specifications of each model is crucial for making an informed purchase.**Weight Capacity:** The maximum weight a purse holder hook can support is a critical factor. Models typically range from 5 lbs to 20 lbs or more. Higher weight capacities are essential for larger, heavier handbags.

A precise weight rating is very important when determining which hook will adequately serve individual needs. It should be noted that listed specifications will vary depending on the manufacturer, and independant lab testing can sometimes reveal more accurate figures.

**Material Composition:** Purse holder hooks are commonly made from materials such as stainless steel, zinc alloy, aluminum, or plastic. Stainless steel and zinc alloy offer both durability and a premium look, while aluminum provides a lightweight yet sturdy option. Plastic models are generally the moast affordable but may not offer the same level of durability.

The material selected impacts durability, aesthetics, and corrosion resistance. Some hooks may also feature decorative elements such as rhinestones or enamel coatings.**Foldable Design & Portability:** Most purse holder hooks feature a foldable design for easy storage and portability.When folded, the hook should be compact enough to fit easily in a purse, pocket, or travel bag.

Pay close attention to the hinge mechanism's durability, which is essential for long-term use. Some models include magnetic closures to keep the hook securely folded when not in use.

**Tabletop Compatibility:** The design of the hook determines its compatibility with different tabletop thicknesses and edge styles. Look for models with a rubberized or non-slip base to prevent slipping and protect surfaces.

The overhang length and angle of the hook are also important factors to consider for stability. Hooks with adjustable arms or flexible designs offer greater versatility across various tables.

**Embedded Non-Slip pad:** Many purse hooks incorporate an embedded, integrated non-slip material to boost friction between the table surface and the hook contact point. This provides better stability, especially on slick surfaces such as glass and polished wood.

These non-slip pads are often made from rubber, silicone, or textured polymers. The quality and design of the pad impact its functionality, so looking for products with well-reviewed non-slip design is recommended.**Swivel Functionality:** Some designs feature a swivel joint that allows the hook to rotate while attached to a surface. This allows for easy bag access, while protecting the hook from potential damages that might otherwise occur from twisting or pulling on the hook by accident.

Models offering a robust swivel motion can be especially advantageous for users carrying larger or heavier bags that may have a tendency to apply greater torsion to the hook.

## Core Benefits

Purse holder hooks offer several practical advantages, making them an essential accessory for many people. From improved hygiene to enhanced security and institution, these hooks provide tangible benefits in various settings.

**Improved Hygiene:** By keeping your purse off the floor, purse holder hooks significantly reduce the risk of exposure to germs, dirt, and other contaminants. This is notably important in public places such as restaurants, restrooms, and waiting rooms.

Users report a noticeable reduction in dirt and stains on their purses after consistent use of a purse holder hook. This maintains the purse‚Äôs appearance and reduces the need for frequent cleaning.

**Enhanced Security:** Purse holder hooks keep your handbag within sight and reach, minimizing the risk of theft or accidental loss. Having your purse securely hanging from a table or desk allows you to keep a watchful eye on your belongings at all times.This is especially beneficial in crowded or unfamiliar environments were you might potentially be more vulnerable to theft. The presence of a hook can also deter potential thieves who might potentially be looking for an easy target.

**Protection from damage:** Hanging your purse using a purse hook prevents it from being accidentally kicked, stepped on, or spilled on. This protects the fabric, hardware, and contents of your purse from potential damage.

this benefit is particularly valuable for protecting delicate or expensive handbags from wear and tear. The hook also minimizes the risk of your purse being scratched or scuffed by rough surfaces.

**Increased Organization:** Purse hooks help keep your belongings organized by providing a designated spot for your purse. This reduces clutter and makes it easier to find what you need.A designated spot may also improve the organization of other items, such as smartphones, keys, and wallets, as users are more likely to consciously organize surrounding belongings.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions about the functionality, compatibility, and care of purse holder hooks. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions to help you make an informed purchase.

**Are purse holder hooks suitable for all types of tables?**
Purse holder hooks are designed to work with a wide range of table types, but compatibility may vary depending on the table thickness, edge style, and surface material. Some hooks may not be suitable for very thick tables or tables with unusually shaped edges. Hooks with rubberized or non-slip bases are generally more versatile and provide better grip on smooth surfaces.

Consider measuring the thickness of the tables you typically use before purchasing a hook to ensure compatibility. Adjustable or flexible designs offer greater versatility across various table types.

**How much weight can a typical purse holder hook support?**
The weight capacity of a purse holder hook varies depending on the material, design, and construction. Most models can support between 5 lbs and 20 lbs, but some heavy-duty hooks may be able to handle even more weight. Always check the manufacturer's specifications before using a hook to ensure that it can safely support the weight of your purse.

avoid overloading the hook, as this can damage the hook or the table. Also, be mindful not to swing the bag around excessively, as the dynamic forces can exceed the static weight rating.**How should I clean and maintain my purse holder hook?**
cleaning and maintaining your purse holder hook is essential for preserving its appearance and functionality. Wipe the hook regularly with a damp cloth to remove dirt, dust, and fingerprints. For stubborn stains, use a mild soap or detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch or damage the surface.

Check the hinge mechanism periodically and lubricate it with a small amount of oil or grease if necessary. Store the hook in a dry place when not in use to prevent rust or corrosion.**Are purse holder hooks airport security kind?**
Most purse holder hooks are made from materials that are safe to carry through airport security. Though, some hooks with decorative elements or sharp edges might potentially be subject to additional scrutiny. To avoid delays, it's best to keep your purse holder hook in your purse or carry-on bag during security screening.

If you're unsure about the TSA regulations regarding a particular hook, check the TSA website or contact your airline for more information.

They‚Äôre both in panties and oversized shirts ‚Äî not glamorous, but safe. Two steaming mugs of hot cocoa rest on the coffee table. The day was long, full of difficult patients and draining emotions. Now, all that's left is quiet.]

Syrenwe (softly, curled into one corner of the couch): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still thinking about that little boy we saw today... the one with the broken arm. He was so scared. Poor thing.‚Äù

Marina (sighs, leaning back with her mug in hand):‚ÄúI know. His mom looked more traumatized than him, though. Honestly, if he hadn‚Äôt smiled at your stickers, I think I would‚Äôve cried.‚Äù(she chuckles faintly, then takes a sip of cocoa) ‚ÄúYou were great with him, Wewe.‚Äù

Syrenwe (blushing faintly):‚ÄúThanks... I try. I just... wish I could do more sometimes.‚Äù

Marina (gently teasing):‚ÄúAlways trying to save the whole world, huh?‚Äù (She gives a little smirk, but it fades as she watches Syrenwe look down. After a pause, her voice softens)‚ÄúI get it. That feeling doesn‚Äôt really go away.‚Äù

Syrenwe (lifting her gaze):‚ÄúHow did you get into medicine, Marina? I mean... you seem like someone who could‚Äôve done a hundred other things.‚Äù

Marina (grinning):‚ÄúI could‚Äôve been a pop star, obviously. Or a pirate. Maybe a flamenco dancer. But nah... I guess it started with my mom.‚Äù 

(She sets her mug down and leans back, looking up at the ceiling with a small nostalgic sigh.)

Marina:‚ÄúShe was a doctor too. In Guant√°namo. Worked long shifts, came home smelling like antiseptic and cafecito. I thought she was magic. My dad fixed cars ‚Äî he could build you an engine from nothing. I used to think if they touched something together, it could come back to life.‚Äù

Syrenwe (smiling softly):‚ÄúThat sounds beautiful... like something out of a novel.‚Äù

Marina (chuckles, then shrugs): l‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt always pretty. I mean, I had a happy enough childhood, but rough, you know? People teased me. A lot. Especially for my name.‚Äù

Syrenwe (carefully): ‚ÄúJesusa... Flamingo, right?‚Äù

Marina (groans and hides her face in a pillow):
""S√≠, Dios m√≠o. Marina Jesusa Flamingo Lopez. My mom was feeling poetic and tropical the day I was born.‚Äù

Syrenwe (giggling softly): ""It‚Äôs... unique. Memorable.‚Äù

Marina (peeking out from behind the pillow):‚ÄúYou can say it. It‚Äôs ridiculous.‚Äù (But then, more quietly)‚ÄúI used to cry about it. My cousins ‚Äî I have like sixty ‚Äî they‚Äôd call me ‚ÄòJesusa la Flaminga‚Äô and squawk at me. I learned to yell back louder than them. I guess I never really stopped.‚Äù

(They both laugh, but there's a pause. Marina‚Äôs smile softens again.)

Marina: ""College was my escape. I got into med school in S√£o Paulo. That‚Äôs where I met Diego.‚Äù

Syrenwe (gently):
‚ÄúYour husband?‚Äù

Marina (nods, her voice losing volume): ‚ÄúYeah... Diego Cavalera. He was Portuguese. Studying architecture. Sweetest man I‚Äôve ever met. He liked silence, which was weird because I never shut up. But somehow we fit. Like I was the spark and he was the grounding wire.‚Äù

(Marina looks down at her hands.)

Marina:‚ÄúWe got married a couple years after we met. I changed my name ‚Äî Cavalera. I thought it sounded cooler, more... like someone people wouldn‚Äôt laugh at. And it reminded me of him. Strong. Balanced.‚Äù

Syrenwe (softly, her brows knit with quiet concern):
‚Äú...What happened?‚Äù

Marina (exhales through her nose, not crying ‚Äî but close):‚ÄúCar accident. Rainy night. He was just going to get groceries.‚Äù(She blinks a few times)‚ÄúI never saw him again.‚Äù

(Silence. The rain continues outside. Syrenwe gently reaches over and places a hand over Marina‚Äôs. Marina doesn‚Äôt look up, but she doesn‚Äôt pull away either.)

Marina (barely above a whisper):‚ÄúI left everything behind after that. S√£o Paulo. My friends. Our apartment. I moved here and started over. It's been... messy. But I try to help people. It keeps me sane.‚Äù

(Syrenwe scoots a little closer on the couch. The lamp flickers slightly with the wind.)

Syrenwe:‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stronger than you think, Marina.‚Äù

Marina (finally looking at her):‚ÄúI don‚Äôt always feel that way.‚Äù

Syrenwe (a soft smile): ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I think people like us... we don‚Äôt have to be strong all the time.‚Äù 

(Their hands remain quietly intertwined for a moment longer. Marina leans her head gently on Syrenwe‚Äôs shoulder, and for once, she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to be loud or witty. The silence is okay.)

Marina (murmuring): ‚ÄúThanks for being here, Wewe.‚Äù

Syrenwe (smiling, blushing just a little): ‚ÄúAnytime.‚Äù

(The two sit in the golden light, cocoa cooling, hearts just a little more open, the air thick with something unspoken and gentle.)
.
Syrenwe (softly, after a long pause):
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never lost someone like that.‚Äù(She hesitates)
‚ÄúBut I do know what it‚Äôs like... to feel like you're rebuilding yourself from pieces. I‚Äî I second guess myself all the time. Even when I know I‚Äôve done something right.‚Äù

Marina (tilting her head to glance up at her): ‚ÄúYou? But you're so... thoughtful. You care so much. It's like... you have this quiet light around you.‚Äù

Syrenwe (blushing, her eyes flicking down): ‚ÄúI try to hide how unsure I feel, I guess. People think I‚Äôm calm, but inside I‚Äôm usually panicking about everything.‚Äù

Marina (grinning gently):‚ÄúYou wear it well. I would've never guessed.‚Äù (She lifts her head, sitting up slightly now, but still close.)‚ÄúI mean, yeah, you blush when I call you Wewe, and you give me that little pouty look when I tease you‚Ä¶ but I always thought you had this quiet strength. Like‚Ä¶ like snow that doesn't melt, no matter how loud the world gets.‚Äù

Syrenwe (smiling shyly):‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kind of beautiful.‚Äù

Marina (playfully bumping her shoulder): ‚ÄúI can be poetic too, y‚Äôknow. Not just a mouthy doctor with tragic eyebrows.‚Äù

Syrenwe (laughs, covering her mouth):‚ÄúYour eyebrows are fine!‚Äù

Marina:‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fierce. Like battle flags. But I digress.‚Äù (Her tone softens again)‚ÄúIt means a lot‚Ä¶ talking like this. I don‚Äôt usually let people in. Not since‚Ä¶ well. You know.‚Äù

Syrenwe (looking at her gently):‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you did.‚Äù
(A pause)‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôm here tonight.‚Äù

(They look at each other ‚Äî that quiet, slightly awkward moment where everything feels suspended in the air. Marina leans in slightly, eyes soft and searching.)

Syrenwe (whispering shyly):‚ÄúCan I... kiss you?‚Äù

Marina (smiles): ""Like you really have to ask.‚Äù

(Marina leans in slowly, carefully ‚Äî the way you do when something matters. Their lips meet in a soft, tentative kiss, barely more than a brush. It‚Äôs warm. Honest. Gentle. A beginning, not a promise.)

(Just as Marina starts to lean back, Syrenwe shifts slightly ‚Äî and misjudges where the edge of the couch ends. With a startled squeak, she tips right off the couch and lands on the rug with a light thump and a shocked blink.)

Syrenwe: ‚ÄúOw‚Äî!‚Äù

Marina (blinking, then bursting into laughter):‚Äú¬°Dios m√≠o! Wewe!‚Äù

Syrenwe (face bright red, laughing too as she tries to sit up):‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay! I‚Äôm okay! That was just... gravity being rude.‚Äù

(Marina slides off the couch, still giggling, and crouches beside her, offering a hand.)

Marina (grinning): ""You just wanted me to come down here with you, admit it.‚Äù

Syrenwe (laughing through the embarrassment): ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

(They sit there together for a moment, cross-legged on the rug, shoulders brushing. The tension has lifted ‚Äî now replaced by that easy, happy kind of closeness. The kind that lingers even after the laughter fades.)

Marina (softer now):‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of surprises, Wewe.‚Äù

Syrenwe (smiling shyly): ""So are you.‚Äù

I am honestly exhausted in this dating game, endless swiping on faces in apps, meeting in questionable bars etc. and I am ready to meet my forever person if it's in the cards. No games here! Looking for someone I could grow to genuinely trust who won't flake out. I care more about the substance of the person & want to take care of someone else to the best of my ability in all ways too.

Obviously physical attraction does matter to a degree, but you don't need to be perfect. I just want that person I really click with and hopefully we can enjoy each other's company. Play some video games, have a laugh, or just chit chat. I wish I could be truly excited by someone's presence again. That kind of thing where you can't wait to talk to that person again.

# About me -

I'm an average looking slightly nerdy but masculine guy. I'm 5'8, white, have curly hair, and have an average physique but have started working out a bit. Not fat but not skinny either. I think I look decent. I will be glad to swap pics once we've been chatting for a little while. I am an INTJ / Ambivert. I look pretty young for my age, I get mistaken as someone in their early to mid 20s all the time. Still have all my hair. (lol)

I have a lot of hopes, dreams, and goals. I try my best to be kind and caring. I would say I have a dry sense of humor, and enjoy deep conversations about life that could go anywhere. I'm not a city person but I don't like living in the middle of nowhere either.

I enjoy a variety of different things. I love playing video games even though lately I haven't had time. Doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice calms me and makes me relax. I enjoy hiking trails around here locally.

Road trips, exploring new music (lets swap music?) , reading books, long drives through the countryside with good coffee and conversation, watching movies or shows, and listening to podcasts. If you play certain games, I will gladly play them with you! I'm also open to trying new hobbies with my partner. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too.

I live in a small-ish town here in NC and don't really get the opportunity to meet people outside of work too often due to having a busy week, then being too tired on the weekends but I'd like to change that! I am a sweet guy who just wants that special spark with someone again. I want to meet a girl who will hijack my weekends and prevent me from becoming a workaholic, lol.

I have a camper that has 400w installed solar and 2 AGM batteries in parallel for about 160 AH of capacity or so.

Understand it‚Äôs a vague question, so maybe focus on reliability, price per watt hour, and value ratio (say something includes 400w of solar panels).

I‚Äôd like it to have a 30 amp plug so I don‚Äôt have to use the dog bone connector, and if at all possible I‚Äôd really like something that could run the ac for 20 to 30 minutes.

I don‚Äôt use a lot of power off grid / 12V fridge (I leave the drink fridge outside off), a few lights, water pump, igniters for propane water heater and stove, and a couple of fans. Plus keeping phone and air pods charged.

I was camping this weekend for a shakedown off grid trip and it was suddenly more overcast than expected so I picked up a 2000w pure sine wave inverter from Harbor Freight. It powered everything but the AC just fine - I used it to microwave food and run a coffee pot.

For those interested, the inverter is a cool option that lets you hook into your truck battery (make sure your car is running!) and essentially turn your truck into a generator. I used it to top off the batteries before bed, but want something quiet because the campground I like to stay in has some really awesome sites in the generator free loop.  Running a solar charger instead of a gas generator or the truck inverter opens up some cool spots for me.",0,1753238640.0,RVLiving,4,0.5,False

Looking for a wholesome connection. ü´∂,"**Hi there, Welcome to my post & thanks for checking it out!**

I am honestly exhausted in this dating game, endless swiping on faces in apps, meeting in questionable bars etc. and I am ready to meet my forever person if it's in the cards. No games here! Looking for someone I could grow to genuinely trust who won't flake out. I care more about the substance of the person & want to take care of someone else to the best of my ability in all ways too.

Obviously physical attraction does matter to a degree, but you don't need to be perfect. I just want that person I really click with and hopefully we can enjoy each other's company. Play some video games, have a laugh, or just chit chat. I wish I could be truly excited by someone's presence again. That kind of thing where you can't wait to talk to that person again.

# About me -

I'm an average looking slightly nerdy but masculine guy. I'm 5'8, white, have curly hair, and have an average physique but have started working out a bit. Not fat but not skinny either. I think I look decent. I will be glad to swap pics once we've been chatting for a little while. I am an INTJ / Ambivert. I look pretty young for my age, I get mistaken as someone in their early to mid 20s all the time. Still have all my hair. (lol)

I have a lot of hopes, dreams, and goals. I try my best to be kind and caring. I would say I have a dry sense of humor, and enjoy deep conversations about life that could go anywhere. I'm not a city person but I don't like living in the middle of nowhere either.

I enjoy a variety of different things. I love playing video games even though lately I haven't had time. Doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice calms me and makes me relax. I enjoy hiking trails around here locally.

Road trips, exploring new music (lets swap music?) , reading books, long drives through the countryside with good coffee and conversation, watching movies or shows, and listening to podcasts. If you play certain games, I will gladly play them with you! I'm also open to trying new hobbies with my partner. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too.

I live in a small-ish town here in NC and don't really get the opportunity to meet people outside of work too often due to having a busy week, then being too tired on the weekends but I'd like to change that! I am a sweet guy who just wants that special spark with someone again. I want to meet a girl who will hijack my weekends and prevent me from becoming a workaholic, lol.

Long story short, I want to enjoy quality time together even if it means just voice chatting at first. If you show me that you're worth it, I will make you a priority.

But! In the past few weeks, I‚Äôve really been struck by how great people are- I went to a concert where seniors sang in a choir, in a park as the sun set. There were loads of people there sitting on picnic blankets and cheering like crazy at every song. 

I work as a barista and I also LOVE seeing the wide scope of humanity that comes in and gets coffee. Being on the register is my favorite thing, because I can strike up conversations with people and learn about them. And nobody is sadder after they get their coffee- it improves everyone‚Äôs day!

Fundamentally, I really do think humans are amazing and good. We all are together, living our own lives and getting through the world as best we can, sometimes intersecting and sometimes never meeting. There‚Äôs so much bad out there, but there‚Äôs so much good too.

I read my rape book they hand rape victims and never felt seen but also felt my shields go down. I walked to a bridge and started to watch the cars go by, seeing how my dead body would disrupt traffic and cause a big crash. I thought everyone gave up on me. But then, I remembered, that God cares and he wants me to prove everyone wrong. I fell asleep and woke up a new person. I walked from the bridge and returned to the coffee shop where I got those resources. Walked in as if they never saw me cry.

I may have DID but I declare myself as a survivor. A boss. And a bitch with a soft spot. I will let no one tear me down

This world is cold and mechanical, yes, but in every winter is a volcano of warmth and fire. There are people who care about you. For me, it is the LGBTQ community and my own African American community.

I believe suicide is the absence in the belief your life will get better. The absence of love and warmth. And the romanticization of death and revenge. No one dies just to die.

The worst and most traumatizing part about it is that it stops being about revenge. Because you realize that even if your life ends, they will still somehow blame it on you and use you as an example. That's why I got up. Suicide isn't the solution. Opening their eyes by showing how much stronger your worldview is than there's.

They see me homeless on the streets as evidence that their comfort and stagnation is better than critical thinking and progress. My entire family turned against me because of my differing beliefs than theirs. They turned because I questioned their lifestyles so they made me go through hell to ""teach me a lesson"". But I will show them all the superiority of my outlook.

Black lives do matter. People should be able to have sex as they please and who they please with. Drugs should be legal and not criminalized for usage. Pure capitalism is dystopian. The government needs to intervene. Homeless people deserve a safe place to live. Mentally ill people deserve to be heard not silenced. Women deserve rights and a chance to prove themselves (as well as the right to have needed protections). Mental illness deserves sympathy not stigma. Children deserve more anatomy. Rape should be as bad as murder. Trans rights are human rights. Empathy and understanding over villainization and stereotyping

The world crushes those who question it because letting ""dangerous"" ideas grow will destroy reality as we know it. However if you deem an idea dangerous then perhaps it is your worldview that is flimsy and flawed.

After extensive research and consulting with interior designers, I've found some clear answers that might help you too.

The short answer is: Yes, your rug should absolutely go under your coffee table. Here's why:

First, placing your coffee table on top of the rug creates a more cohesive and anchored look in your living space. When the rug runs underneath, it ties all your furniture pieces together and makes the room feel more purposeful and organized.

I learned this the hard way when I initially tried placing my rug around the coffee table. It made the room feel disconnected and somehow smaller. The floating coffee table created an awkward visual break in the space.

Here are some practical guidelines I've discovered:

- Leave 18-24 inches of rug visible on all sides of your coffee table
- Make sure at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs sit on the rug
- Choose a rug size that's proportional to your room (8x10 or 9x12 work well for most spaces)

Speaking of coffee tables, I found some gorgeous options that work perfectly with this rug placement strategy here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Some additional considerations:

1. Protection: Rugs protect your flooring from furniture scratches
2. Sound absorption: Having the rug under furniture reduces noise
3. Visual flow: Creates a natural pathway through the room
4. Maintenance: Easier to vacuum when everything's properly aligned

There are some exceptions though. If you have a very small living room or an unusually shaped coffee table, you might need to adjust these rules. Also, if you're working with a vintage or antique rug, you'll want to ensure your coffee table won't damage it.

I recently helped my sister with her living room design, and we found some amazing modern and traditional coffee tables that work perfectly with this under-rug placement: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember, the goal is to create a balanced, welcoming space that feels intentional and put together. Having your rug extend under your coffee table is one of those small details that makes a big difference in achieving that polished look.

One final tip: If you're still unsure about placement, try laying out painter's tape on your floor to visualize different rug sizes and positions before making your final decision. This helped me tremendously when I was planning my space.

Hope this helps you make the right choice for your living room setup!",1,1753238363.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Shared coffee. Shared stories. Shared laughter and worries. 

But the hardest words I'll still keep inside. We're not yet at our parting, so I can't ask you to stay; and I don't want to make your life difficult or intrude on your  heart. I don't know well enough that my affection won't cause you hurt, and the last thing I want to cause you is pain. 

You can probably see it, though it goes politely ignored, and I'm grateful you don't use it against me. You've always been in my corner and helped me lift myself up, and really you're well out of my league. 

It might be a while though, between this coffee and next, and the weeks between our last and now have been painful. Our friendship never hurt. Not until now. And for the sake of your softness I hope the only one hurting is me. 

The pain I can bear, and bear it I will; our friendship has a limited lifespan. Better to sit and enjoy what I have, laughter and coffee and smiles, than to ruin it all and have you leave early. 

But after the coffee, when we part ways, a part of me wishes you'd linger. You're braver than me in all ways and scenarios, and so part of me wishes you'd reach. Sometimes I think I see it in you; the same ache that I feel inside me. I don't know if it's there or if I just wish it was, but I wish you'd to be braver than I am. 

I wish you'd reach for me and hold me close before leaving, and tell me you wish we could stay. I wish you'd tell me that your heart holds space for me, in the way that mine does for you. I wish you'd entangle your fingers with mine, kiss my forehead and say that everything - even us - will remain unbroken. 

But I'll say nothing about any of it. I'll keep it all in. I'm not brave enough to risk losing you early. Better to bear it and enjoy you this way as the one man that can still make me smile. 

I just can't help but fear somehow you're feeling it too. The pain, the worry, and doubt. You're so like myself and you aren't likely to reach without first feeling sure of my actions. If you're mired this way right along with me, you'll be needing my bravery just as much. 

But my spirit is smaller than yours and my self doubt far greater. I really don't think I can be first. I'm not sure I can ever be that brave, not even for you, so for now I'll keep it safely inside.

I'll see you soon and I really can't wait to see your smile, hear your voice, and feel your presence. The coffee will taste good but it won't even come close the sound of your laugh, your kind face, and your essence. Hug me please, before we part ways, and tell me you've missed me when I arrive. 

Because I've missed you. And when we part I'll miss you again. Deeply, in a way where my soul cries.

So I‚Äôm 32F and I started at 316.6 pounds and i‚Äôm 5‚Äô9. I just had a baby 4 months ago and we ate like shit postpartum because it was easier. My pre pregnancy weight was 303 so I gained 13 pounds total postpartum, I know this because I weighed 302 a week after giving birth. 

Today is day 9 of carnivore but in the first 7 days I lost 12 pounds and I‚Äôm down to 304.2, which is crazy to me that it was that easy? I have obviously eaten sugar and carbs my whole life to get to 300lbs so cutting them out is clearly drastically changing my life. 

I for sure got the carnivore flu for a couple of days, once I added in electrolytes I started feeling better and didn‚Äôt have as bad of body aches. But other than that it hasn‚Äôt been that bad. Day 6-7 was the worst craving wise and I really wanted a chocolate chip cookie lol but that has mostly passed which is surprising. 

Anyways, my question is, will the weight continue to drop like this? Is there any way I can make sure I still loose a good amount of weight every week, etc?

(1-Gallon Jar of Pure Tangy Perfection)

Quick Summary:

This is the breakfast of champions, full stop. Two of these bold, vinegary flavor bombs in the morning and you‚Äôll feel like you could build a fence with your bare hands before 8 a.m. They‚Äôre not blow-your-face-off hot ‚Äî Trappey‚Äôs Bull Hot Sauce brings rich flavor with just a whisper of heat. It‚Äôs all about that tang, depth, and protein punch. Cold egg, flaky salt, black coffee ‚Äî god-tier combo.

‚∏ª

What You‚Äôll Need:

	‚Ä¢	5 dozen (60) large eggs ‚Äì fills about ¬æ of a 1-gallon jar
	
‚Ä¢	1 gallon glass jar with a lid
	
‚Ä¢	Vinegar ‚Äì enough to fully cover all the eggs once packed
	
‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre feeling a little bourgeoisie, use sugarcane vinegar for absolute perfection.
	
‚Ä¢	If not, plain old white vinegar works just fine. No judgment, still damn good.
	
‚Ä¢	3 bottles (12 oz each) of Trappey‚Äôs Bull Louisiana Hot Sauce
	
‚Ä¢	Big-ass pot or saucepan
	
‚Ä¢	Fridge (unless you live recklessly)
	
‚Ä¢	(Optional but elite) Fleur de sel or good flaky salt

‚∏ª

Instructions:

1. Boil the Eggs:

Hard-boil 5 dozen eggs. That‚Äôs 60 eggs. You‚Äôre not making a snack ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a fortress of flavor.
Let them cool, then peel them all. It sucks, but it‚Äôs worth it.

2. Pack the Jar:

Cram those peeled eggs into the gallon jar.
Now fill the jar all the way to the top with vinegar ‚Äî make sure every egg is fully submerged. This step is crucial. No floating soldiers. Take note of how much liquid it takes (this will be your total brine volume).

3. Make the Brine:

Pour all that vinegar out of the jar and into a pot.
Add 3 bottles (36 oz total) of Trappey‚Äôs Bull Hot Sauce to the vinegar.
Heat it up and bring it to a boil. It should smell tangy and rich, not painful.

4. Pour it Back:

Carefully pour the hot brine back over the eggs in the jar. Take your time ‚Äî no cracked eggs, no scalded hands.
Seal the jar loosely if it‚Äôs still warm and let it cool down to room temp.

5. Let Them Pickle:

Refrigerate the jar and let the eggs pickle for 2 to 3 weeks.
That‚Äôs when the flavor settles in deep.
(Look ‚Äî I‚Äôve left mine at room temp and didn‚Äôt die. But officially? That‚Äôs not food safe. So toss it in the fridge.)

6. Eat Like You Mean It:

Once they‚Äôre ready, slice one in half, sprinkle on some fleur de sel or flaky salt, and enjoy.
Mild heat, bold flavor, perfectly balanced.
You‚Äôll be hooked. Might even flex on your coworkers about it. That‚Äôs fine.

‚∏ª

Bonus Move:

Chop these into your potato salad.
It‚Äôll go from ‚Äúokay‚Äù to ‚Äúwho the hell made this?!‚Äù real fast. People will beg you for the secret. Laugh in their face and say it‚Äôs classified.

You survived here? You earned stripes. You thrive here? You deserve reparations and rooftop snacks. Now flip to The Bronx intro and buckle up‚Äînext stop is a borough that makes concrete cry.



# The Bronx (The Fallout Borough)



The Bronx is a natural fallout shelter‚Äî even radiation avoids the commute in the Cross Bronx Expressway. The Burning Bronx, having been rebuilt from the ashes of its destruction, now collectively crumbles. Each ravaged hood comes dressed in its own historical trauma, structural neglect, and street-certified complexity. Surviving the Bronx isn't just a badge‚Äîit‚Äôs a full certification in adversity, adaptability, and attitude. You don‚Äôt flinch, you don‚Äôt fold‚Äîyou adapt with swagger, like cockroaches in Timbs strolling Fordham Road. Bronxites are like the weeds that grow around the tombstone. üíÄü™¶ But hey, weeds are tough. They grow through concrete, get stepped on, never die, and still manage to flex green under grime. So while the Bronx may wear its coffin crown, its people? Resilient as hell. The Bronx was never built for comfort‚Äîit was **tooled for toughness**. Yet every sunrise is survival in style.



# üî• South Bronx



Charred bones of tenements still whisper through renovated facades. Modern signage **slapped over trauma**. You‚Äôll see artisanal coffee shops next to probation offices. Street names remember fires, even if the newcomers don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs rebirthed‚Äîbut born premature, **still coughing up smoke**.



# ü•ä Hunts Point



*Industrial wasteland flirting with gentrification*

Home of meat markets, strippers, warehouses, and **dreams marinating in fish juice**. You smell ambition and asphalt in the same breath. The art scene tiptoes through blocks that still run on tire fires and hustle. Want a mural? Dodge the forklift first.



# üö® Mott Haven



*Developer darling with a bulletproof soul*

Everywhere you look, there‚Äôs a yoga studio under scaffolding and a vape shop trying to replace bodegas. But behind the fresh brick, gunshots still recite the nightly news. The river views are nice if you‚Äôre into watching corruption float by.



# üö™ Tremont



*High-rise chaos meets corner stoicism*

The buildings rise like concrete tombstones. Elevators might work, but stories echo louder in the stairwells. Kids grow up fast because the playground‚Äôs rules are made of instinct and survival. Cops cruise like sharks in a shallow pond.



# üçó Fordham Road



*Retail insanity riding shotgun with raw reality*

There‚Äôs always traffic, always shouting, always someone grilling chicken under a broken bus stop. A storefront closes and reopens the next day with a new name but same bulletproof window. It's the BX version of reincarnation.



# üß± Grand Concourse



*Once the Champs-√âlys√©es of the Bronx, now an unintentional museum of ambition*

Pre-war buildings flex like forgotten royalty. Some wear scaffolding like old bandages. You walk past graffitied history, fractured pride, and people who dress sharp despite cracked sidewalks. Elegance still pulses‚Äîbut it bleeds.



# ü•æ Soundview



*Where concrete meets swamp and defiance grows like weeds*

Nature and neglect shake hands. Pigeons look like they bench press rats. The housing projects stand like fortresses‚Äîhomegrown battlegrounds where grandmas bless stoops and side-eyes are mandatory.



# üî™ Castle Hill



*Sturdy bones, tattooed memories*

Brick projects stand like hardened elders watching over quiet chaos. It‚Äôs where sneakers hang on wires like memorials and corners talk more than landlords. The park benches remember things your lease never will. There's loyalty here, but you earn it with sweat, not smiles.



# üî´ Throgs Neck



*Island vibe meets generational grit*

Driveways and faded flags. Here, families own houses, but the shadows still bark. You‚Äôll find SUVs parked over cracked sidewalks and block parties that end with three cousins fighting in the street. Proud, territorial, and low-key simmering. Don't mistake quiet for softness.



# üîß West Farms



*Where grit sleeps light and wakes fast*

Day starts with a siren and ends with someone yelling through a cracked intercom. Buildings lean with exhaustion. The corner store doubles as church, therapist, and battlefield. Kids know shortcuts through alleyways better than directions to school.



# üíä Highbridge



*Old scars under fresh paint*

One building is halfway luxury; the next one still has burn marks from the '80s. You‚Äôll see someone dancing on TikTok while a rat the size of a Yorkie drags a sandwich across the street. It's progress wearing yesterday‚Äôs shoes. Half dream, half flashback.



# üõ†Ô∏è Kingsbridge



*Blue-collar Bronx with hard shoulders*

Raised on hustle, built on elbow grease. You'll hear three languages in one bodega and smell fried food that could raise the dead. The struggle‚Äôs not hidden here‚Äîit's honored. If you cry, make it quick; someone‚Äôs waiting behind you at the deli.



# üßÉ Soundview (expansion)



*Still built like a fortress‚Äîbut now with vape smoke and TikTok dances*

Concrete‚Äôs still the religion. The courtyards tell stories at night. And even if gentrification knocks, Soundview answers with a side-eye and a grill still hot from last night‚Äôs chicken thighs.



# üß• Riverdale



*Yonkers cosplaying as NYC*

Leafy and low-key like it pays taxes somewhere else. Residents act like the Bronx is something they heard about once in high school. You‚Äôll see cardigan-wrapped denial and gated serenity while subway-less silence hums in the background. A place where pizza comes with a side of cognitive dissonance.



# üíä Morrisania



*Unfiltered BX realism with no apology*

Buildings breathe struggle. The air smells like corner hustle and second chances. Music still echoes from crates and stoops, but the concrete ain't singing‚Äîit‚Äôs grinding. No one's pretending here. You either grow, grind, or ghost.



# üöç Pelham Parkway



*Queens energy in Bronx skin*

Tree-lined illusions, surprisingly quiet, deceptively decent. Feels like the neighborhood got dropped from a suburban dimension and told to make do. A place where the BX spirit tiptoes in orthopedic sneakers.



# üï∂Ô∏è Mount Eden



*Density served medium rare with sirens*

This is where buildings stack like Lego trauma. Elevators know your secrets and stairwells do background checks. Families hustle, tension simmers, and stories unfold next to playgrounds made of rebar and dreams.



# üóÇÔ∏è Fordham Hill



*Education district meets sidewalk entropy*

You‚Äôre steps from elite universities, yet the corner deli sells energy drinks with missing ingredients. The campus tries to pretend it‚Äôs in its own zip code‚Äîwhile the street laughs and plays dominoes on its doorstep.



# üêÅ Kingsbridge Heights



*Elevation with edge*

Tucked and hilly, this zone rolls uphill but never feels high-end. You dodge squirrels with attitude and hear arguments about lotto numbers and whether the Mets are still cursed. Stability‚Äôs possible‚Äîbut only if you earn it through generational proof.

The Bronx was never built for comfort‚Äîit was carved for resilience. And you‚Äôve walked these blocks with eyes wide open, so let me know if you want me to hit Norwood, Wakefield, or those deep east corners where forgotten buildings still spit stories through cracked windows. This ain't a tour‚Äîit‚Äôs a reckoning.



# City Island ‚Äì The Bronx‚Äôs Lobster Roll-Shaped Exception



Let‚Äôs dish it up unfiltered:



# üêö City Island



*Nautical suburbia pretending it‚Äôs not landlocked to the BX*

Feels like you took a wrong turn in the Bronx and ended up in a tiny New England fishing village staffed by retired cab drivers and boat hoarders. It's got seafood spots stacked like crustacean chapels and more pirate flags than actual crime. Cops ride boats, not cruisers. Locals act like they live ‚Äúoffshore,‚Äù even though they‚Äôre tethered to the mainland by a thin stretch of denial asphalt.

You‚Äôll hear Bronx accents ordering crab legs like they‚Äôre in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard with a side of beef patties. Seagulls flex harder than pigeons. Every block smells like clam juice and gasoline. Housing options? Mostly small homes with porches built for staring wistfully across water like you're in a Hallmark movie with graffiti.

If you ever wanted the Bronx to take a vacation from itself, City Island is the layover. It‚Äôs where the borough goes to sea but can‚Äôt shake the swagger. Want me to roast other outer-BX enclaves next? We still got Van Nest, Eastchester, and pockets of confusion waiting to be lovingly slandered. Let‚Äôs keep it Bronx bold.



# Bronx Breakdown Continued



Let‚Äôs mop up the rest of the Bronx with zero grace and full flavor. These neighborhoods aren‚Äôt just ZIP codes‚Äîthey‚Äôre living, groaning, haggling creatures wearing cracked sneakers and blasting bachata from third-floor windows. Here's your brass-knuckle Bronx breakdown continued:



# üèöÔ∏è Van Nest



*Small neighborhood with big mood swings*

It‚Äôs the kind of place that feels like someone duct-taped suburban dreams onto urban headaches. Houses squint at each other across narrow streets, and you can smell five cultures in one backyard cookout. Low-key, mid-chaos, the land of low fences and loud truths.



# üß† Wakefield



*Top-of-the-Bronx with bottomless grit*

It‚Äôs got Jamaican food that slaps and sidewalks that threaten your ankles. You‚Äôre more likely to hear a dancehall mixtape than birds chirping, and the corner stores double as community centers with a lotto machine gospel. One of the last strongholds where people still sit on stoops and pass judgment like jury duty.



# ü•æ Eastchester



*The Bronx‚Äôs attempt at casual civility*

Part suburban hallucination, part urban shrug. You‚Äôll find lawns and lawn chairs that haven‚Äôt been moved since 2003. People here walk with that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me nothing‚Äù energy, and if there‚Äôs a street mural, it probably got painted by someone‚Äôs cousin who owes back rent. It's decent‚Äîbut like, Bronx decent.



# ü¶é Co-op City



*A concrete continent with its own gravity*

Looks like someone tried to stack Legos during an earthquake. It‚Äôs a universe of high-rises, elevators that hold grudges, and pigeons with tax documents. There‚Äôs greenery, yes‚Äîbut it feels like the trees are unionized. Everyone has a story, and you‚Äôll hear it whether you want to or not.",1,1753237754.0,Unstyle,0,1.0,False

I love that he makes time for me, that he‚Äôs considerate about my tasks for the morning, he doesn‚Äôt even make me talk, sometime we just sit there quietly enjoying the space and drinking our coffee before he leaves for work and I start my day. 

I hate waking up early, but for him, for this,  I do it easily. ",2,1753237486.0,relationshipgoals,0,1.0,False
1m6xd10,https://i.redd.it/a4c5kziiajef1.jpeg,I Swore Off Manual Grinders‚Ä¶ Until This One Changed My Mind,"Hey folks! I got pulled into the Timemore wave seeing all the recent posts, so figured I‚Äôd share my thoughts too üòÑ

Snagged both during the Amazon Prime Day Sale:
‚Äì Timemore C3S for ‚Çπ5.5k
‚Äì Timemore Kettle for ‚Çπ1.5k


---

First up, the grinder.

I love this thing. I had started out with the Agaro manual grinder when I was new to coffee (and hadn‚Äôt even discovered Reddit yet lol). That thing made me hate manual grinding‚Äîsuper slow, too much effort.

But the Timemore C3S? Absolute game-changer. It's smooth, easy to crank, and honestly grinds faster than my water takes to heat up. Didn‚Äôt expect manual grinding to be this enjoyable.

It‚Äôs made me seriously reconsider whether I even need an electric grinder in the future. Good manual grinders really do flip the experience.

If you're just starting out and can stretch your budget, go straight for something like the Timemore.
If you're on a tight budget, Agaro still gets the job done‚Äîjust needs some elbow grease. Definitely better than pre-ground.


---

Now onto the kettle.

For AeroPress, not a major difference.
But for pour overs‚Äîhuge upgrade.

I‚Äôd been using the Hario Drip Assist till now (and will continue using it), but the control this kettle offers is on another level. The built-in thermometer on the lid is super convenient for temp monitoring.

Also, heat retention is surprisingly good. Once I bring it to a boil, the temp stays between 90‚Äì100¬∞C for quite a while‚Äîwhich is perfect for my brews.


---

Overall, this C3S + kettle combo gave me flavors in my pour overs that I hadn‚Äôt been able to unlock before.

Genuinely happy with the purchase. If you‚Äôve been on the fence, this is your sign üòÑ",9,1753237264.0,IndiaCoffee,7,1.0,False

Hopefully this post will be a good asset in the immediate future as well as going forward if it gets enough traction to rate high on SEO, and can get newcomers started in the system and infrastructure, introduce veterans to new modules, and others can comment to recommend me towards new modules. I will break the modules up into different categories while also ranking them from highest to lowest based on how much of an improvement they make within that category.

I will also include whether I think the module is minimal setup (\~0-1 minute of tinkering with the settings), some setup (\~1-5 minutes in the settings), or extensive setup recommended (5+ minutes of setup recommended).

**Please note I and the groups I play in all host our servers locally. I am not sure how well these will work with server hosting services such as Forge.**

# Core Functionality Modules

These modules include improvements to Foundry or the PF2e system relating to mechanics and functionality that you will see in each and-every-session.

**1. PF2e Workbench**

EXTENSIVE SETUP RECOMMENDED

This module can do so much stuff it is very difficult to summarize, and you can choose which parts you want to activate which what parts you do not want to activate. Some of it you will probably want to enable, some of it probably not, and the stuff you do enable you may want to tweak the settings within to your exact liking. But whether or not you want to use PF2e Workbench‚Äôs features like letting you scale NPCs up or down multiple levels, automatically roll persistent damage and apply it and roll the recovery check and automatically remove the persistent damage, remind the GM to hand out hero points, etc.

*Even if you are going to ignore all of that; I still recommend installing this module above all others because of the macros.* I start every campaign whether as a GM or player by recommending that every one else on session 0 search for ‚ÄúBasic Action Macros‚Äù and drag it onto their hotbar. If as a GM I find that one of my players frequently takes forever to find the ‚ÄúRecall Knowledge‚Äù or ‚ÄúEscape‚Äù macros then after the session I will log in as them, find the basic action macros, put it on their hotbar, and direct them towards it in the future. Basic Action Macros provided by this module would be enough for it to get #1 on my list. But then once you see aura macros for spells like Bless and Courageous Anthem, you‚Äôll never play PF2e on Foundry without Workbench ever again. And as a GM I use the macros to blind roll perception for the entire party or to generate randomized loot or apply custom persistent damage or whatever in every session. My players use macros to streamline the earn income activity or repairing equipment or using treat wounds all the time. This module is a must have for PF2e in Foundry for these macros alone, not even to say all the other cool settings the module lets you enable. Get PF2e Workbench. Just do it.

[The \\""Basic Action Macros\\"" screen from PF2e Workbench for a character. Clicking any of these streamlines and rolls the required checks and posts the results to chat if a target is appropriately selected.](https://preview.redd.it/0000dwxx5jef1.png?width=1905&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f4e849bfd0a0db8fcc8d33ef217c911b617d184)

**2. PF2e Toolbelt**

EXTENSIVE SETUP RECOMMENDED

Toolbelt is a lot like Workbench in that it has a bunch of stuff it can do or you can disable, and they can speed things up for both players and GM‚Äôs through a variety of settings to tweak with, but without the macros that Workbench provides. But Toolbelt does also cover variant mechanics such as automatic rune progression or hero points or mythic rules if you use any of these optional rules. It allows players to apply effects to characters controlled by other players (e.g. Player 1 casts guidance and can apply that effect to Player 2‚Äôs character). It allows players to pass items back and forth between their characters without having to go to the Party stash (PSA, if you have never opened the Party sheet in foundry by hitting ‚ÄúP‚Äù or clicking on the paper icon above next to the party folder in the actors tab, you totally should). Toolbelt‚Äôs target helper can be really good for targeting creatures in an AOE, but you have to do it just right and if you don‚Äôt then it can be a pain to fix so I turned it off. But it can be a very streamlined way to target groups if you want to use that. Toolbelt can do lots of stuff and I recommend giving it a look, most will find a few things within that they want to enable.

**3. Tokenizer**

Minimal setup required

This allows you to quickly create tokens for characters based off art existing in your server, or allows you to quickly upload character art and then make a token from that. You can find supplemental modules like ‚ÄúToken Frames‚Äù that gives more frame options to work with as well. You just open the character sheet, click on the artwork, and the left side of the new window allows you to adjust or upload new character art while the right side allows you to update the token.

My usual routine for adding art to a creature is to open the character sheet/statblock, click on the character art jpeg, in the Tokenizer window that comes up click on the checkbox on the top left to allow me to ‚Äúmodify‚Äù the character art, upload the character art, delete the old art, then on the bottom right of the page click on the button for using character art on the token, deleting all other layers, adding a frame, and hitting save. Once you get it down you can go from having the file on your PC to having both character and token art uploaded and attached to the character sheet, all in less than 30 seconds.

**4. Illandril‚Äôs Token Tooltips**

EXTENSIVE SETUP RECOMMENDED

There are many modules out there that change what information is available for players and GMs to see when hovering over a token. This one is my favorite. I have it setup so that when I as the GM hover over a creature, I can see its name and AC and exact HP and its perception and how good its saves are and its movement speed. When players hover over that same creature they see how far that creature is from them and its hitpoints represented by 5 hearts which may be full or empty, in a bit of a Zelda game style. There are so many other ways you can customize this to provide the exact info you want to both the GM and the players.

[What I as the GM see with my settings](https://preview.redd.it/1eo0mmbm3jef1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=26574fbff297615517d37c6c66de0349abdffdaa)

**5. Carousel Combat Tracker**

Some setup recommended

This replicates the initiative order from Foundry‚Äôs combat tracker on the top of the screen. There is a bit of customization you can (and probably should) do to put the combat tracker in the position and orientation you want, and to change how much information the players vs. the GM have access to when hovering their mouse over a creature in the combat tracker.

# Quality of Life Modules

These modules all make it a little bit simpler or easier to perform a thing, or to keep track of a thing, and are a help to both GM and Players alike.

**1. Pop Out**

Minimal setup required

This module allows players and GM‚Äôs\* to pull out pages into another tab via a little ‚ÄúPop Out‚Äù icon that appears at the top of character sheets. Players can pull up their character sheets in another tab and possibly put it on a separate window. As the GM if you are running an adventure path you can pull the journal entry for the page you are on to another page.

\* Note for GM‚Äôs that host your servers locally: you will need to open a browser and put in the local IP address for the game in order to pull up these tabs. It will not work within the Foundry application itself.

**2. Break Time**

Minimal setup required

This module does primarily two things. It gives the GM the ability to hit a little coffee cup icon on the left side of the screen which will start a timed break. Players can hit a button and a red icon will show up next to their name indicating that they have stepped away, or they can click a different button for a green icon to show up indicating they have returned. At the same time it allows the GM to set a timer. So it‚Äôs great for the GM to say ‚ÄúAlright we are going to take a 10 minute break‚Äù and allows for everyone to track the time remaining and who has returned. Additionally this module allows players to hit a little coffee button to quickly indicate that they are away via a customizable chat message, and they can hit that same button to reflect when they have returned.

**3. PF2e Modifiers Matter**

Minimal setup required

One of my bard players a while ago commented that they felt that they were not contributing much in combat, when in reality their little +1‚Äôs here and -1‚Äôs there were a huge part of the party‚Äôs effectiveness. And since then I have gone out of my way to try and show when some +1 bonus a character provides to an ally, or a -2 penalty to the enemy, was the difference between a hit and a miss, or a crit and a hit. This module does that automatically, highlighting in green or red appropriately when some modifier is to thank for pushing something from one degree of success to another. It‚Äôs great for emphasizing the importance of teamwork.

https://preview.redd.it/0uwpyosy4jef1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=006f500b87de5357d92cb6e81a56793cc1b484d6

**4. PF2e Assistant**

Minimal setup recommended

This module helps speed things along in combat a lot. If a character has appropriately targeted who they want to target before doing something like taking the ‚Äútrip‚Äù or ‚Äúfeint‚Äù action, and then makes the roll using the correct button, it will then automatically apply the appropriate effect (e.g. prone or offguard) to the target). It just saves you 2 or 3 clicks, but over time this adds up and helps speed things along quite a bit.

**5. Small Time**

Some setup recommended

This module puts a little clock in the bottom left corner of the screen so that players can see what time of day it is, as well as allows you to use Golarion‚Äôs calendar or make your own custom calendar to keep track of time passing. Additionally you can set up maps so that the lighting level changes depending on if it is day or night or dusk. As long as you aren‚Äôt making a whole new calendar this should be a pretty quick little module to use and is great for keeping track of how much time passes between exploration and 10 minute activities to make a reasonable adventuring day.

https://preview.redd.it/11ecn1x75jef1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=78051b05dc56d90f58e7a2492117a3547db758f6

**6. Combat Booster**

Some setup recommended

I like to use this module to put a blue ring under whoever‚Äôs turn it is, and a faint blue ring under the person next in initiative. This is really helpful for when the players are facing 7 goblins and I am trying to figure out whose turn it is and to remind my players whose turn is coming up, or as a heads up to players that their turn is coming up. It can also apply sound effects to let players know it is their turn or they are up next. The module‚Äôs ability to quickly select from previous actions only works with 5e but the other features this module provides (such as helping clear the battlefield by moving dead creatures into a pile in a corner of the map) all work for PF2e if you want to enable them.

[The dragon is up now and has the blue ring, the bard is up next and has the faint yellow ring. The black \\""X\\"" under the dragon shows where the dragon started its turn thanks to this module as well.](https://preview.redd.it/ve3wf9hl5jef1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ac015f3d372b2486ae5ba3a4f84b09fde76a7d9)

**7. Dice Tray**

Minimal setup required

This adds some clickable little dice icons under the chat log, allowing the GM or players to click on say the d20 and quickly roll a flat check for something or another, and some buttons on the side to blind roll, private roll, self roll, or regular public roll.

https://preview.redd.it/891ypccc6jef1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a4e456376c7f7882ee4ffd10c145b3c2b0bed7

**8. PF2e Keybind Menagerie**

Minimal setup required

Do you have a party with a bunch of characters that tend to apply frightened a lot? Wish there was a quick way to apply frightened, like how you can push ‚Äúf‚Äù on a token to make it flat-footed/offguard? Then this module is for you. It adds dozens and dozens of potential things you can make keybinds for like adding conditions, going to the next turn, try to grapple, etc. I think most people will only add a few keybinds here but this is a great module to add for the convenience of the GM and players to do as much with as they wish.

**9. Polyglot**

Minimal setup required

Say your party comes across a door with some words written on it in some strange language. This module lets you type the contents of that inscription in chat, select the language in question, and the players who do not have characters that don‚Äôt know that language will simply see a bunch of strange characters making unrecognizable words, while those who do understand the language will see both the original and translated versions. It doesn‚Äôt come up that often. But when it does come up and you post it to chat, and everyone says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what it says, looks like just a bunch of demonic runes‚Äù but then that one player chirps up and says ‚ÄúOh wow, I can read it, it‚Äôs abyssal and it says ‚ÄòBe sure to drink your Ovaltine‚Äô‚Äù then those moments are really cool.

[This is spoken in \\""Ogre\\"" which Mirvraak knows. Other characters that speak Ogre will see the above text and the translation. Those who do not know Ogre will only see the strange text.](https://preview.redd.it/yzruo37k6jef1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c2a8fa3466aea12d3ef45ef0e31c3a7b38d93f)

**10. Reaction Checker**

Minimal setup required

The point of this module is to recognize when the conditions for a reaction that a character has access to have been met, and then prompt the GM or player if they want to use that reaction. I don‚Äôt want to oversell this module, it doesn‚Äôt cover every reaction in the world, but it does cover around 100 of the more common ones. As a GM this is really nice because you may forget that this rogueish NPC in fact has nimble dodge, and may forget to use that part of their kit. Or maybe you miss a couple weeks due to scheduling issues and a player forgets they have ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Next.‚Äù But just don‚Äôt rely on this to tell you about every possible reaction a character can use, because it won‚Äôt do that.

**11. Dice Stats**

Minimal setup required

Does that one player think they have the worst luck, when you know it is in fact you that has the worst luck? Want to compare? Are you a third party who wants to ~~laugh at them~~ express your sympathy? This module is for you. It tracks how many times everyone has rolled each value on each die type and provides some simple statistical analysis such as mean, median, and mode. If you add it halfway through a campaign it isn‚Äôt going to have the data on the past rolls. But it is a great little module to install and then check in with at intervals or when the whim takes you, to see who is getting shafted by Lady Luck the most and vice versa.

[The d20 stats for the unluckiest player in one of my groups. This module shows a lot more info too.](https://preview.redd.it/pbbdmwuh7jef1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=01aba7b65f0415672a762428a73f5064fc720059)

**12. Token Z**

Minimal setup required

This module simply makes it so that by default smaller tokens will appear ‚Äúabove‚Äù larger tokens, rather than the larger tokens covering up the smaller tokens. You can also hover over the tokens and press ‚Äúz‚Äù to cycle which token is on top. Just saves a few clicks so that when your Champion mounts their steed, they actually are still visible on top of the large mount and can click on their character token, rather than being smothered by it.

# GM Focused Modules

These modules will make the GM‚Äôs life a bit easier or enhance what the GM can do from a mechanical point of view.

**1. PF2e See Simple Scale Statistics**

Minimal setup required

This module looks at things like a monster‚Äôs HP, skill modifiers, AC, etc. and either highlights them in green or red depending on whether the values fall above or below the baseline threshold for a creature of that level. This is really nice say if somebody gets a crit success on a recall knowledge, so you can provide them with the info they ask for and then need to figure out something extra to tell them, and you see that red AC vs the saves all in green, and say ‚ÄúAnd you also feel it may be best to go for direct attacks against their AC rather than worrying with those pesky saves.‚Äù Or as a GM when you pull up your 10th statblock of the session you see that ‚ÄúIntimidation‚Äù in green and it serves as a reminder that maybe you should open your turn with a shot at demoralizing the PCs with this creature, rather than trying 3 attacks.

[In order for the highlights to show, make sure you click on the \\""Mark Stats\\"" button indicated. Note the Fort saves vs the Will saves, or things like Athletics which are right about average vs. Intimidation which is above average, vs Deception which is way above average.](https://preview.redd.it/pzugnam08jef1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2512fe243fa32bca85aa6afd76ebe5898907c2)

**2. Moulinette + Free Art Assets**

Some setup recommended

The biggest downside is the GB of storage this takes, which may run you into a wall with server space if using something like Forge or on your PC‚Äôs storage space. But if you are running an AP where it says ‚ÄúIn the southwest corner of the room lies a corpse with some piece of paper in their hand‚Äù but the map doesn‚Äôt actually have a corpse there, then this module and some free art assets allows you to quickly search for and add a tile to make the map match the scene. Or if you are running your homebrew thing, and found the perfect battlemap except a key part of the map needs to be a large statue which isn‚Äôt present, then this combination allows you to quickly add a statue to the scene. A creature casts the earthquake spell while in a tower, causing the roof to come collapsing down? Add some tiles of rubble to make the map match the dynamic combat. A tutorial on how to use Moulinette and where to quickly find and install thousands of art assets all at once has been made by Lunatic Dice [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMfEyCb6hIw) (and you should check out other videos by him too, many of the modules on this list I found thanks to his videos or the comments on them).

**3. Quick Insert**

Minimal setup required

I have this module installed but always forget to use it to save a few clicks. Instead of going to the compendium to search for something, find it, then drag it to where you want back on the screen (whether that be bringing a creature onto a map or an item onto a character sheet or other), you can instead hit Ctrl+Space (configurable) to pop up a compendium search right where your cursor is, find the object or creature in question, and quickly insert it. It‚Äôs a nice little time saver when you remember to use it.

**4. PF2e Award XP**

Minimal setup required

If you use milestone leveling then this module is a complete waste. But if you use exp leveling then it is great. Whenever you close a combat encounter a window will pop-up asking if you want to provide the party with exp for the encounter. It automatically fills in the amount of exp based on the number and level of creatures in the encounter vs. the number and level of player characters, but also allows you to customize this. Just note that if you do what I used to do of deleting the tokens of defeated creatures with no loot, then they will get deleted from the initiative tracker, and this module will not consider them when distributing exp. I recommend using other modules listed above to automatically hide defeated creatures from initiative and/or hide or move defeated creatures into a corner if you will be using this module. Also if you want to give the whole party some milestone exp all at once or something, with this module you can just type /award into the chat to get the same window to pop up.

https://preview.redd.it/luy32b3f8jef1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dd73b663dc1c5888fd056eda43ecc4f075fa39f

**5. Actually private messages**

Minimal setup required

If you are tired of doing some self GM rolls, or secretly rolling stealth checks for a bunch of monsters, only for the players to hear a bunch of dice rolling and see messages in chat like ‚ÄúThe GM secretly rolled some dice,‚Äù then this module is for you. I do recommend letting the roller of dice hear dice roll though. Otherwise your players may blind-GM roll you stuff but get no feedback that dice were rolled, and keep rolling over and over thinking that Foundry is bugging out while you are getting 15 rolls from them.

# Player Focused Modules

These modules make it a little easier for players to make, level up, or carry out activities with their characters.

**1. Pathmuncher**

Minimal setup required

For players who make their characters on Pathbuilder, this module allows you to import the character as either a JSON or a link to the character. It does run into some issues like with deities on divine characters that due to copyright issues cannot be included in Pathbuilder, and therefore cannot be directly imported to Foundry. But it‚Äôs great for letting players make characters on their own time and come to session 1 with their character fully built and ready to go and fully made with only a few clicks.

**2. PF2e Companion Compendia**

Minimal setup required

If none of your characters use animal companions, undead companions, familiars, or eidolons, then this module may not help you. But in my experience a character is always using at least one of these, and this module makes them unbelievably easy to manage. You just make them their own character sheet as though they were character, and this module then adds a bunch of ‚Äúclasses‚Äù reflecting the type of minion that it is. It makes leveling them up a breeze, rather than the confusion that always seems to emerge with these minion rules and mechanics.

**3. PF2e Dailies**

Minimal setup required

In a similar vein to Companion Compendia, if you do not have players that use familiars or staves or are playing as an Animist then you can probably skip this module. But if you do have player characters using those options (especially, especially Animist characters) then this module makes managing those characters and all the stuff they select with their daily preparations a breeze and is highly recommended.

**4. PF2e Playtest Data**

Minimal setup required

If the GM is letting players select playtest classes such as Necromancer or Runesmith then this module includes those playtest classes and their mechanics and feats for characters to use.

# Cosmetic Modules

These modules all make the game look more appealing, or add cosmetic effects that make the game more engaging.

**1. Dice so Nice**

Extensive setup inevitable

This module may have an impact on performance. Individual players can turn off the effects if they are too much for their GPU. But it lets each player and GM make their own customizable dice set so that when they roll various things their personalized dice are then rolled across the screen. Like with Tokenizer there are other module creator‚Äôs that have created additional customization options, such as ‚ÄúLordu‚Äôs Custom Dice.‚Äù

**2. FXMaster**

Minimal setup required

I don‚Äôt really know that this module will have substantial performance impacts on PCs but I suspect there is at least some measurable amount of performance decrease. However what it does is add a variety of weather and similar atmospheric effects. This goes well beyond rain or fog effects. For example if on a map set on a beach then you can use this to have small little seagulls wander about the environment. Or if in a volcano area then you can make little embers that flitter around on the map. It is a small touch that goes a long way towards the ambience.

**3. Splatter**

Minimal setup required

This module makes it so that when a creature is injured then it leaves a ‚Äúblood‚Äù stain behind depending on the creature type. For example a humanoid will leave behind red blood, while a plant may leave behind green gooey sap, and a construct may leave behind greyish-black oil. You can customize it to determine at what health threshold the stains should begin appearing and how large they should be.

**4. PF2e Effects Halo**

Minimal setup required

Normally as you apply effects like frightened, hastened, slowed, blessed, etc. to a character, they appear on the token starting in the top left corner and descend until you hit the bottom of the token‚Äôs space, and then another column begins next to the first. This just changes it so that the effects now instead wrap around the border of the creature‚Äôs token. It makes for what I find to be a more ascetically pleasing appearance.

# Substantial Cosmetic Modules

These modules have substantial cosmetic changes which I in fact view as a bit too much, and are so distracting that I do not use them. But I thought I would include them since I am sure they are to the appeal of some.

1. PF2e Animation Macros

This module adds a ton of very bright and brilliant effects whenever they do certain actions, such as entering rage to cause a bit of an earthquake around them, or chain lightning chaining between all the enemies you have targeted when you cast it. And some of them are really cool and I‚Äôd be down for adding them to my game! But some of them are just too much and too flashy and not really what I want in my game, such as Sneak Attack‚Äôs cosmetic effect. And while I probably could disable the effects I don‚Äôt want to see or hear, I do not think the benefits from the few effects I would keep are worth it. But it is a very high quality and good module for those looking for this sort of thing.

2. PF2e Creature Sounds

This module adds about 100 voice effects such as grunts for when a character attacks, takes damage, or dies. To me they come across as goofy and distracting but others may like them.",18,1753236656.0,Pathfinder2e,4,0.91,False

At first, I thought his drinking was mainly because we were getting to know one another and having fun but I gradually started to feel uneasy about how much he drank. I really began to notice that it was an issue when we went away for a family holiday (me and my then 12 yr old and my partner). We went to a pub for lunch and he spent more time at the bar back and forth to the table than he did with us. I drove us back to the holiday home and he kept on drinking all afternoon (and drank the owners booze too). He absolutely stank of alcohol the next day and I had to drive us home because he was most definitely over the limit. There was no apology or acknowledgement that he had overdone it. I told him when we got home that I was concerned by how much he was drinking and that I thought he needed to rein it in. I suggested we do dry Jan which he agreed to.

Fast forward to mid Jan and i noticed that the whiskey bottle in the cabinet was a very strange light yellow colour. Turns out it was mostly water and after confronting him about this he came clean and told me he had been drinking it and watering it down. After this, I have periodically smelt alcohol on his breath during the middle of the day, but he has denied drinking. I have found more bottles of whiskey or other booze in the cabinet or in his car. When I confront him he says he hides it to avoid conflict with me (even though he drinks in front of me, and we will have a glass of wine together over dinner). Every holiday we have been on involves him binge drinking every day. And sometimes when we've been away he will have whiskey in his coffee in the morning or a glass of wine.

He denies he has a drinking problem (although I have threatened to leave him if there is any more dishonesty and he now admits that maybe there is a problem and has promised that he will quit drinking). But I grew up in a house where alcohol was normalised so I am having a hard time trusting my gut and doubting myself. He is also kind and patient and doesn't get angry so I know it could be worse. But I feel like he has created an environment that has normalised dishonesty and deception and I have lost my trust in him and in our relationship. I guess i am just seeking advice as to whether you think there is a serious problem here. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a hyper vigilant state and I feel like that is where I am at right now. I'm also spending way too much time thinking about what to do.

TL;DR my partner has a problematic relationship with alcohol; but I worry I am overreacting and that I am making a big issue out of it. He is still sweet and kind when drinking. ",0,1753236490.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.5,False

·•´·≠°.
     hii!! i wanted to show you all how i like to manifest! i‚Äôve gotten some results with this lil technique and thought some of u might appreciate this!

¬∑ ¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑‚ú∂¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑ ¬∑

 ·•´·≠°.
      i call this ‚Äúthe list‚Äù! its really simple to do and you can make it detailed if you‚Äôd like! but if ur lazy (like me) you can make it as simple as you‚Äôd like! all you have to do is write down your manifestations! for example:

1. i‚Äôm living my desired lifestyle.
2. i have my desired face.
3. i have my desired body.

¬∑ ¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑‚ú∂¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑ ¬∑

·•´·≠°.
     ^^ something like that! i personally write it in present tense! instead of saying ‚Äúim manifesting my desired face‚Äù,, i simply affirm that i already HAVE my desire face/body! personally it makes my manifestations come in faster when i affirm that i already have what i want. because if you already HAVE your desire then there‚Äôs no need to check constantly for it! i just tell myself i have what i want and move on with my day! i don‚Äôt check nor do i pay attention to the 3D.

when you finish up the list (write down whatever you want!! just make sure you REALLY want it!), you can use this affirmation: ‚ÄúI have manifested everything on this list. I already have what I want.‚Äù

it‚Äôs such a simple affirmation and easy to repeat throughout the day! no matter what you‚Äôre doing, you can just repeat this affirmation in your head (or out loud)! usually, i like to pair my affirmations with EFT tapping! I listen to Tap with Brad!

¬∑ ¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑‚ú∂¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑ ¬∑

HOW I MANIFEST WITH MY LIST:

·•´·≠°. 
     soo,, my routine is very simple! i‚Äôll wake up, walk around for about ten minutes or so (usually my mama makes me breakfast so i pass the ten mins quickly) and i‚Äôll return to my room. i‚Äôll put on a timer for 10 mins and start my eft tapping, repeating my affirmations out loud/in my head! if you like, you can also visualize your desires whilst affirming.

i tend to eft tapping twice a day (day and night) and i‚Äôll repeat my affirmations for 10 minutes. it‚Äôs basically robotic affirmations! i also like to read my list so im fully aware of what I have/what i‚Äôve manifested. if it‚Äôs nighttime i‚Äôll simply go to bed! if it‚Äôs daytime, i go about my day!

i also listen to my playlist at night since it‚Äôs only 2 hours and easy to repeat. i don‚Äôt listen to my playlist EVERYDAY though,, i usually take a day or two off of subliminals and just affirm normally. it‚Äôs a neat little method and i find it way easier to manifest like this!

¬∑ ¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑‚ú∂¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑ ¬∑

RESULTS:

so far these are the results i‚Äôve gotten this week and last week!

1. constantly receiving money! i always ended up getting money bc my dad would ask me to order something, send me the money and id be left with extra! i also got 200 from my brother!

2. my face has def changed! my jawline is sharper and my lips have gotten plumper.

3. my waist has gotten slimmer and my tummy is more firm/flat. 

4. my thighs have grown thick again! i lost a lot of weight a few months ago and ive been using subs to regain back my thickness and thankfully my thighs aren‚Äôt skinny anymore <3 i missed my thick thighs

5. being pampered! my parents already spoil me but last week they kept getting me things i wanted! i was also being praised for my cooking and my mom kept calling me ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and saying how much she loved me which makes me soo happy!! she also started offering me snacks and coffee again! 

¬∑ ¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑‚ú∂¬∑ ‚îÄ ¬∑ ¬∑

and that‚Äôd be all! i hope you guys enjoyed this silly post and i hope you guys get your manifestations by this week! 
also i hope this lil technique works for u too :3

1m6wxz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m6wxz7/do_you_think_this_warrants_going_to_the_er_delays/,Do you think this warrants going to the ER? Delays in seeing a specialist and growing concern.,"I'm a 31 year old male, good shape, don't regularly take any medication or vitamins. I drink a cup or two of coffee a day and am a smoker (nicotine vapes). 

I did cocaine with my fianc√©e two months ago. This is not a typical thing for me and was the only time I've done hard drugs in 6+ years. We had a good time but when the comedown started to hit, I suddenly got tunnel vision and my neck felt kind of uncomfortable, it's hard to describe. I paced around for a while full of anxiety about what I was experiencing but ultimately it started to go away after a few hours. 

I eventually went to bed and woke up the next morning with a splitting left side headache and what felt like a stuffy left ear. Over the next couple of days I started getting neurological symptoms as well, tingling sensations in fingertips. Left side of face felt tingly. Headache subsided however (for the most part). I still feel an odd sort of pressure in the left side of my head. It's not painful but it is concerning. I went 4 days like this before deciding to go to the ER. They checked my heart and did a CT scan with no contrast and some blood tests, told me I was good and sent me home. Said the bloodtest showed I had no clots. They advised that I follow up with my doctor. I scheduled the appointment but it was two weeks out, so I went about life normally until the appointment came around. At that appointment they did another bloodtest, everything was normal except I was very slightly low on calcium. We scheduled another appointment 2 weeks out for follow up to see if things were improving and referral to a neurologist and rheumatologist.

Symptoms calmed down a bunch but are still present. The facial tingling is nearly constant but varies in severity. I also noticed that if I scrunch the left side of my face (like closing my eye hard) and then release it, it feels like the muscles cramp slightly and they release more slowly than the right side. I've had brief instances of nerve pain in my forearms and legs randomly. I've had pain in the left side of my neck that tends to coincide with the ear fullness coming back. This varies each day now, I wake up feeling mostly normal and as the day goes on the symptoms come back or start to become more severe. By bedtime each night (11pm or so) they're extremely noticeable most nights. Some rare nights I have minimal symptoms like I do in the morning. My left eye is also intermittently blurry throughout the day (like I can't focus it well).

It seems like heat (like getting into my hot car that was parked in direct sunlight) immediately makes symptoms worse. It seems like caffeine makes symptoms worse. It seems like eating candy makes symptoms worse.  I also have extreme fatigue by the end of the day. I've always been the kind of person who can go to bed at the same time every night, but if I want to stay up a few more hours, I am capable of it. Now I'm passing out for the night at 8:30 pm sometimes, against my intentions. I get home from work each day feeling like I'm exhausted mentally. It also seems like the absolute worst thing that makes the symptoms worse is not getting enough sleep. There's also moments every day where I'm feeling fine and suddenly feel faint for a few seconds, it's very disconcerting. There's been a few times where I had trouble finding the word I was thinking of while symptoms were going on, words that I shouldn't have had trouble remembering.

Anyway, I went to my doctor's appointment, got labs done. Waited two weeks and then had another appointment for a referral to neurology and to see if I still had symptoms. It has been suspected for some time I have an autoimmune disorder of some sort, and that's what my doctor suspects. Possibly MS, and possibly cocaine caused it to flare up worse than before. I think that's likely but I can't shake the feeling I may have an unburst aneurysm. My doctor is taking it seriously that I want to rule that out first and foremost, but when we set up the appointment with neurology to have that done, they screwed up the referral. 

I was referred for an interview with their headache specialist instead of an appointment for an MRI with contrast. On top of that, the appointment is 3 months out at the soonest. They told me it's possible I could have an MRI afterwards if the headache specialist deems it necessary, but it would be another appointment, another few months out. I'm extremely worried that if I'm right, and if I wait there may be complications. 

So in summary, it has been two months since the night I did cocaine. I am STILL having these symptoms. They've gotten milder but they're still present. Part of me feels like the fact that I feel almost-normal for most of the day means I should continue trying to investigate it through my doctor. It doesn't feel severe enough to be an emergency. The other part of me is whispering in the back of my head ""if you don't go to the ER there's a chance you could be right, and you're risking your life"". 

Basically, I just want advice for what to do. My state's specialists are extremely backed up and I doubt I'm going to be able to get an MRI any time in the next 3+ months if I try to continue with this route. I also fucking hate going to the hospital and am fearful that if I am right, I'll be rushed into surgery or something which is terrifying to me. Do you guys think I should be rushing to the ER to have an MRI? I'm trying to push to get an earlier appointment with the neurology clinic but I don't know if that is actually going to work. 

Anyway, as you can probably tell I'm very stressed. I made a reddit account just to ask about this. I appreciate any replies and if I broke any rules, please let me know and I'll edit it.",1,1753236066.0,AskDocs,5,1.0,False

My wife and I currently live in Lakewood, OH (just outside Cleveland), and it‚Äôs been an incredible place to live as vegans with an active lifestyle. We‚Äôre planning to relocate, but I‚Äôm realizing just how hard it is to find another neighborhood that offers what Lakewood does.

Here‚Äôs what we love about it:

It‚Äôs very walkable ‚Äî we can walk to multiple vegan spots within 10‚Äì15 minutes.

We live just down the street from Cleveland Vegan, a fantastic fully vegan restaurant. There‚Äôs also a vegan coffee shop, a vegan donut shop, and a vegan deli all within walking distance.

We‚Äôre located less than half a mile from a bike trail that connects to the larger trail system ‚Äî we could literally ride our bikes all the way to Columbus if we wanted to.

We have a fenced backyard, which is important because we have three large dogs who need space.

As we‚Äôve started looking at other places around the country, we‚Äôre realizing how rare it is to find a neighborhood ‚Äî not just a city ‚Äî that combines true vegan food density, walkability, nearby bike trails, and homes with yards.

I know cities like Portland, Asheville, and LA have strong vegan scenes, but I‚Äôm looking for specific neighborhoods where this kind of lifestyle is genuinely possible day to day.

If you‚Äôve found a place that fits this bill, or made a similar move and found a great vegan-friendly neighborhood with room for dogs and active living, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.

1m6wmps,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6wmps,Comprehensive Experience with Dr. Danielle Dumestre with Austin Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery- 2 months post-op,"**Overview**

I've tried to include my entire experience, start to finish, to try to help anyone with any obscure question in this sub, since I haven't seen much posted about Dr. Dumestre in general. Please do reply or dm with ANY questions though, consider me your resource, I love helping people :)

Overall, I had a great experience and have healed tremendously well. Good surgeon, good results, good experience. I am going to include some minor criticisms in this review but do not interpret those as me having a negative experience. Attached (in order) are photos of my results 2 months (now) into recovery, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, and finally pre-op vs 1 week.

**Scheduling**

To be honest, the initial scheduling was a little bit frustrating. I called the office to schedule a consultation appointment and was told that I would be contacted back by the consultation scheduler to schedule a date. A week past, I called about it, and was assured the same thing. Another week, another call, no schedule. It wasn't untill the fourth week of calling and telling the receptionist that I had been waiting for a call that she personally hunted down the scheduler for me and got my consultation appointment scheduled. Unsure if this a pattern with this place or just a one-off, but I was busy at the time so it didn't frustrate me too much. My consultation appointment was scheduled for 3/7/25, a month after I finally got in contact with the scheduler, so 2 months after beginning the process.

About one month after the consultation, I was called on 4/10/25 to schedule my surgery date for 5/20/25, just over one month away. Obviously, I was stoked, and surprised that they were able to schedule me so quickly after my consultation. Apparently this is pretty common and they move quite quickly, which is nice.

I had my pre-op appointment scheduled about 2 weeks before my surgery, on 5/5/25. One day after my surgery, I had a check-up call with the nurse. I had a 1-week post op checkup and a 2-week post op checkup, and have one scheduled in August as a 3-month checkup.

Overall, once I got the ball rolling with the initial consultation things moved really quickly. I was expecting to have to wait for a long time to get my surgery date.

**Personal Experience**

DR. DANIELLE DUMESTRE: A very sweet, respectful lady. I spoke more with the nurses than I did with her in the end, but she was present for my pre-op appointment. She walked me through what she would be doing, what my scars would look like, and some photos of past clients. She made sure all my questions were answered, although I do wish I could have discussed more with her on nipple placement in the end.

THE SURGERY TEAM: All the staff is great. Everybody that I interacted with was female, if that is important to anyone, and highly talented. I worked most closely with Ruth, who answered all of my silly questions and made herself very available outside appointments. Vangie, the insurance and scheduling person, was also really great to work with. She always immediatly answered the phone and explained things to me (particularly insurance and billing as this was my first big surgery) without assuming I knew everything. She was very no-nonsense and understood that its very much us vs the insurance. Overall, I definitely felt like the team was 'on my side' so to speak.

THE AUSTIN PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE CENTER BUILDING:   It was very clean, white, and posh. Very chic. There was free sparkling water and coffee. The team mostly works with women doing breast augmentations/reductions and those with breast cancer, so I found that alot of the decor and resources were very.. feminine? I felt a little out of place as a ratty guy in such a nice place but they really made me feel welcome regardles. Their resources are geared towards women, and so is some of the language in them, and although it didn't particularly bother me they were really gentle and explanatory about it in a way that I think would comfort those that might have been bothered.

THE HOSPITAL (St. David's Medical Center South Austin, 901 W Ben White) :   Although I have beef with their insurance team, the hospital and hospital team were great. I showed up, they took a blood test, admitted me, and I hung out in a very comfy room for an hour or so. They gave me some meds preemptively for nausea and pain and I dressed in that gown. Dr. Dumestre came in to draw lines on my chest and speak to me briefly. My nurse was a fun dude and we chatted about his experience as a student. The anaesthesiology team from NAPA were also very fun and easy going, and although I wasn't nervous, definitely did chill me out. They also offered to give me something to ease anxiety if I had any.

THE SURGERY: I was wheeled into the surgical room and a team of people chatted with me casually. When I was ready, they pushed the anesthesia and I woke up in recovery, woozy from the drugs. After recovering for 1-2 hours, the hospital was ready to get me moving and I was escorted out in a wheelchair to my mom's car picking me up.

**Healing**

COMMUNICATION: I do wish the team had communicated with me more about post-op recovery, as alot of what I did I learned from personal research and this sub. Overall, their reccommendations were more lax than other surgeons. They reccomended that I can be out in the sun (with a ton of sunscreen) after 3 weeks, wear compression untill 4 weeks, and be cleared for any physical activity after 6 weeks. They did walk me through post-op healing of the scars and nipples untill the scabs healed, and just generally recommended silicon tape, but did not have advice on massages or moisturizing routines. They did not have any post-op physical therapy resources for me (unfortunately) so I had to use [this guide](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Top_Surgery_Rehab_Guide_-_Dockside_Physiotherapy/29621978?file=56474804) I found on this sub.

PRESCRIPTIONS: They did this really well. In the informational packet they gave me, they explained each prescription, its use, when I should use it, and how often. They prescribed me everything before the surgery so I could pick it up without worry. I was prescribed oxycodone, celecoxib, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, coloace (constipation) and a laxative, as well as anti-nausea medication. In total, these probably cost \~$50-60, with the powdered laxative being the most expensive.

POSTOP HEALING INSTRUCTIONS:  They reccomended I buy a more comfortable zip-up binder to immediatly replace the hospital one, which I did. For the first week, I was instructed not to touch anything and therefore did not remove the big gauze pads placed on top of my incisions. I was woozy and knocked out for the first 2-3 days, but pretty normal after that. I saw my incisions for the first time on my 1 week appointment. I had small drains that they took out painlessly. There, they gave me paper steristrips to apply to my incisions, and instructed me to keep my nipples coated in aquaphor and covered in non-stick gauze. I kept applying the steri-strips for another week, and found small non-stick gauze pads with adhesive strips at walgreens to use on my nips. At my 2-week, they instructed me to keep applying generous amounts of aquaphor on my nipples and incisions untill all the scabs had fallen off. At this time, they told me I was allowed to begin using silicon tape on my incisions, which I had to purchase myself. They told me to keep compression untill the 4th week.

RECOVERY:  I recovered very quickly, gaining my mobility back easily largely in part to the PT I did in the guide I linked earlier. Very little pain, I took maybe 2 oxycodone and was fine on celebrex/tylenol after that, and was totally off pain meds by a little over 1 week. I had hardly any swelling at all and no bruising. The most obvious side effect was just feeling more exhausted from doing things. Although I'm unsure how much they helped, I took bromelain supplements as well as vitamin C supplements for a month after the surgery. I could put my arms above my head easily by week 2 although I tried to keep it minimized. I stopped sleeping at an incline around that time too as it was beginning to piss me off.

SUPPLEMENTAL ITEMS: Besides [this cheap zip-up compression vest ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8JBVRVX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1&psc=1)from amazon, I found a mastectomy pillow to be very helpful and it felt like it kept me together in the first week. A grabber was good for lights/ceiling fans. Dried prunes and apricots for post-surgery constipation. Compression socks for possible blood clots from laying around. A nice straw for drinkin things, and lots of gatorade. Baby wipes for cleaning yourself when you can't shower. Aquaphor, cerave moisturizing lotion, and silicon strips for later stage healing.

RESULT:  I'm very happy with my result. Dr. Dumestre outlined my natural pecs very well, and although I have a little bit of a dog ear I think that was inevitable. I do wish my nips were a little closer together but I hope to get jacked to lessen this effect :)

**Billing/Insurance/Pricing**

I am going to be as transparent as possible here as this was the part I was most stressed about and did not see talked about very much here or online. I had Aetna insurance, in-network. I provided the doctor with a letter of proof of Testosterone therapy and a letter from a psychiatrist, including their full name, signature, and license number.

The billing was split into three different parties: The Surgeon, The Anesthesiologist, and The Hospital. I was placed in St. David's Medical Center of South Austin because apparently this hospital was the closest one that accepted insurance and allowed gender-affirming care surgeries. I was in-network for all of these places, and Dr. Dumestres team made sure of that, but DEFINITELTY make sure to confirm this beforehand!! You do not want to get screwed. The insurance prior-authorization was submitted a month before my surgery date and was approved much beforehand, so no stress there.

To Dr. Dumestre and her surgical team, I paid \~$400 (15k billed to insurance). To Austin Anesthesiology Group LLP, I paid $707 (2.3k to insurance). To St. David's Medical Center of South Austin, I paid \~$1300 (61k to insurance). In total, I paid \~$2,500 in medical bills out of pocket for the surgery itself.

I had a 600$ deductible to completely pay before I reached my plans 80% covered thing, which went to the Anesthiology company since they filed first. If the hospital had filed first, I would have paid the anesthesia only $100 and the hospital $1900. Same amount of money just split different ways.

IMPORTANT: This hospital (St. David's Medical Center of South Austin) called me 3 days before my surgery to collect my payment, and claimed I owed them $3,712, even though my insurance had given me an estimate of \~1300. This (obviously) set me in a panic, and after calling the hospital and being transferred for 2 hours, I could not find out a reason why. Finally, after speaking to some family members in the medical field, I learned that the hospital was trying to charge me (and my insurance) the absolute MAXIMUM price for my surgery if everything goes wrong and I have to stay overnight etc, and after the fact they would *theoretically* refund me the difference after the surgery (although they are not required to!). If they had told me this I wouldn't have been in such a panic, but no such information was mentioned. I called around untill I found a 'finincial counselor' that offered me a 'payment option' of paying only 35% of the total upfront and then paying 'the rest later' (Guess what 35% of 3712 is. That's right! Exactly 1300. No coincidence). This is the option I chose and I paid in check at the hospital the day of the surgery, although they also had card options. Apparently this '35%' number is a magic number that is used all over so businesses can claim as much money as possible from you and, in particular, the insurance. Although they should theoretically refund you, I would NOT trust a hospital to do that. After the surgery, my bill was only $1287, not $3712, and I never had to 'pay the rest later' as the financial counselor suggested. This all seems really predatory and I hope that by sharing this I can help someone in the same situation.

**Conclusion**

I know this is a massive post, but if it can help even one person, I'll be grateful. I will continue to post updates on my recovery with time, I can't believe its already been 2 months!

MY ADVICE FOR THOSE ABOUT TO GET THE SURGERY: It is so, so worth it. The gender euphoria will make you giddy. You're allowed to be scared and nervous, but know that you are in good hands and everything will turn out just fine. Don't be afraid to ask your surgeon questions and iron out what you want, its your body. Follow your surgeons advice, and DONT WORRY, you havent messed up your results because you accidentally raised your arm above your head. It's not that easy to mess up. Your incisions and nipples are healing fine and normal, although they look weird. You got this, you're gonna look great, good luck!!

For those of us that can struggle with our own emotion regulation at times (let alone our kid's), maybe you'll also find this strategy helpful. 

Successful emotion regulation often generally boils down to: feeling the feeling, pausing, then acting. The pause is crucial. Without it, our actions can be dictated by our emotions rather than logic/reason. The pause can also be very difficult to effectively implement - you have to choose to do it while you're actively feeling your feelings and your kids are feeling their feelings. 

Learning to pause is a skill and like any other, it can be learned and improved. But why learn a new skill, when you can rely on one that's been ingrained in the very fabric of your being since birth? Enter: the Midwestern ""Ope"". 

The scenario: Sees kid standing on couch, eying the coffee table. 
Without ""Ope"": reactive emotions and thoughts immediately followed by something along the lines of ""Don't you dare jump off that couch!"",
""Get off that couch right now!"" 
With the ""Ope"": same reactive emotions and thoughts, but paused before acting followed by something like ""Ope, looks like you're about to jump off the couch. That could get you hurt."", "" Ope, I see you eying the coffee table from there. Let's get you down.""

Obviously not a silver bullet or one size fits all, but it might help to embrace your inner Midwesterner. ",2,1753234960.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

I do it as a job and I do it as a hobby. I enjoy trying different things and using my family as lab rats to see what‚Äôs good. 

One thing that is good for sure is my chocolate cake recipe that I came across a while ago and just perfected to my liking. Every time we have a family get together I bring my chocolate raspberry cake. Everyone always brings something else since they know what I bring.

The issue starts a while back on a holiday I don‚Äôt think exists in other countries so let‚Äôs just ignore it. My SIL hit me up and asked for the recipe since she wanted to make it this time. I gave her the recipe since she‚Äôs family and not a competing bakery.

We showed up to my mother‚Äôs house and I made 5 different breads instead since the cake wasn‚Äôt my job this time. Bla bla bla Bla bla, then came dessert time and the cake looked fine. We all took a bite and obviously immediately noticed she didn‚Äôt follow my recipe.  

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with putting your own twist but my cake is kind of a tradition and she obviously didn‚Äôt think it through. She swapped the water for STRONG coffee, made up her own ratio of cream and ignored the dulce de leche. 

She noticed that we noticed and told us she made it her own. We all just said wow how unique and tried to move on but my SIL really wanted my opinion. I asked her if she was sure since it wasn‚Äôt all good and she still said ‚Äútell me‚Äù, so I did.

I told her the caramel and cream are there to combat the bitter and overwhelming flavour of chocolate and to sweeten the sour raspberries. The coffee also didn‚Äôt go well with such little sweetener and sour raspberries. She just nodded and got quiet. I thought ‚Äúyea maybe I was harsh but she asked for it‚Äù and I thought we moved on.

Now came time for a get together again and this time my niece asked to make the cake. I asked her if she was sure she wanted to do it alone since it is a cake that takes hours to make and has a lot of prep. She said yes and that‚Äôs what we got again at my mother‚Äôs place.

Just from looking I could tell immediately she also kinda freestyled but I keep my mouth shut. Even after tasting there were obvious errors but she‚Äôs 9 and this was her first time baking something like this so I don‚Äôt expect much better. 

My SIL then decided to butt in and ask for ‚Äúmy brutal critiques‚Äù of her work. I told her no since my niece didn‚Äôt ask for it herself. SIL kept insisting that if I can tell her all she did wrong in front of others, I should ‚Äúplay by my rules‚Äù and do the same for my niece. I told her to shut up and stop trying to make me hurt her child just because I told her she made a mistake not following a professionals tried and retried recipe.

She once again got quiet and just sulked on the couch. Later my niece came to me alone and asked for the truth. I was hesitant since her mother might have put her up to it but since we were alone I decided to bite the bullet. 

I told her in summary: The recipe uses fresh raspberries but if she can‚Äôt get her hands on them she should always defrost the raspberries before and make them into a mush. She also doesn‚Äôt own a cake cutter so she should just try to wing it with the knife and use the thicker part under so even when the raspberries let the juice out, it wouldn‚Äôt soak through into the plate like it did. The cream should be mixed with the caramel by machine and the cake should be taken out the oven when you stick something in the middle and it comes out slightly wet with some crumbs and just to let it cool and cook itself in the middle. 

I felt like it was a good conversation since I assume she came to me when she was ready and it wasn‚Äôt in front of others. I also took the blame since my recipe does leave out things I know in my head.

I‚Äôm not really asking if I‚Äôm the AH with my niece since she‚Äôs a kid and I think I handled it well but more with my SIL and how do I address her odd behaviour. ",3,1753234411.0,AITAH,1,0.81,False

Just wondering if anyone has knowledge of or experience with the OIPC regulations regarding reasonable fees for release of records. I‚Äôm just wondering what is considered ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù. 

Last year I asked my psychologist for my therapy notes and she quoted me for the time it would take for her to photocopy them based on her hourly rate.

I haven't told you this, but I‚Äôve been carrying the shape of you in the broken puzzle pieces of my heart since long before I had a name or face to attach them to.

Not the fantasy of you. Not an idea of you. Just...you.

The real you.

The woman who second-guesses herself. Who carries the weight of the world, even when she doesn‚Äôt have to. Who gives endlessly, not out of obligation, but because she truly wants to. Who doesn‚Äôt realize how beautiful and strong she is, because somewhere along the way, someone told her she was ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù

But the truth is, you‚Äôre exactly what you need to be.

Through everything in my life‚Äîthe heartbreaks, the loss, the laughter and the healing‚ÄîI‚Äôve been learning how to love in a way that doesn‚Äôt shy away. A kind of love that doesn‚Äôt flinch. That doesn‚Äôt try to fix what isn‚Äôt broken. That stands firm. That holds space. That stays. And I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I know this for certain: I don‚Äôt want to love halfway. I want the silences. The storms. The raw honesty. The emotional intensity. I want you. Unfiltered.

I want the ordinary days. The morning coffee, you in the sunlight, half-smiling, hair a mess but beautiful. The quiet on the couch as we talk about our day. The adventures both large and small. The new memories. The laughter we both didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever find again.

But I also want the heavy moments. The days when you feel like too much. Because to me you never will be. The days when the world takes more than it gives. Because to me, you‚Äôll always be just the right amount to want. I want to hold you tight when you can‚Äôt hold yourself together. To be the arms you fall into when the day breaks you down. To be your comfort, because you are also mine. To know your cracks not so that I can fix them but so that I can learn the places that the light gets in.

This isn‚Äôt about rushing. I'm not telling you I love you. Not yet. But I can see that being a future for the two of us. I'm just simply telling you the truth of where I am right now: I‚Äôve made space for someone who happens to be exactly like you. And the more I get to know you‚Ä¶the more pieces of you I find that feel like they fit the missing puzzle pieces of me broken off through the years of life and loss.

So don‚Äôt worry about being perfect. To me, you already are. Don‚Äôt worry about saying the right thing. I just want you to be you. And if you ever feel that quiet pull, that little voice that wonders: ‚ÄúCould it be that he really sees me? Could he really handle all of my emotional intensity?‚Äù I hope you know the answer.

Yes.

I do.

I can.

And I‚Äôm here.

Yours,

1m6w9hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m6w9hj/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting?,"So I'm a (18) year old lesbian with my high school sweetheart (18) years, She's been awfully distant lately, I'm a overthinker also a curious person, We have a open relationship no secrets so I was being paranoid until she randomly leaves our shared apartment at 8:00pm, She's not the type to go out at all so I became even more suspicious but I waited for her to come home.

I stayed up the whole night. She did not arrive home in the morning. She stumbled into the house quietly and I was sitting on the bed.
 She saw me there and I said in a tone that I can't really identify myself ""Where did you go last night"" She stopped briefly in her tracks, She looked startled and panicked at my sudden question.‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I just needed space,‚Äù she mumbled, barely looking at me. Her eyes darted to the floor like it had the answers she didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSpace?‚Äù I repeated, my voice shaking. Not from anger, but from that kind of heartbreak where your throat starts closing up but your heart‚Äôs still trying to hold it down. ‚ÄúYou needed space, so you left at 8PM and didn‚Äôt come home until sunrise?‚Äù

No answer. Just silence. I could feel my pulse in my ears.

‚ÄúI stayed up all night waiting for you,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt even text?‚Äù

She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Like she was choking on a lie and didn‚Äôt know how to dress it up nice enough to pass it off as the truth.

I stood up from the bed slowly. My voice dropped.

‚ÄúWas it someone else?‚Äù

Her eyes flicked up to meet mine. That‚Äôs when I knew.

I didn‚Äôt need details. Didn‚Äôt need to know a name, what they did, or how it started. Her silence screamed loud enough.

I laughed once‚Äîsharp and bitter. ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt cheat,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what is it like?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou disappear. No message. You come home smelling like a stranger and your only excuse is ‚Äòspace‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been confused,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you. I just‚Äîlately I haven‚Äôt felt‚Ä¶ connected.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you connect with someone else?‚Äù

She bit her lip, and that silence settled in again. She always shuts down when she‚Äôs caught. I used to think it was guilt. Now I realize it‚Äôs cowardice.

‚ÄúYou know what hurts the most?‚Äù I said, walking toward the dresser. ‚ÄúYou let me sit in that bed and wait for you. You let me think you were in danger. I was about to call hospitals.‚Äù

That made her flinch. Good.

She tried to step closer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt say sorry to clear your conscience. Say sorry when you‚Äôre ready to change something.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything else.

I opened the drawer, pulled out my old hoodie‚Äîthe one I kept from before we moved in together‚Äîand tossed it over my shoulder.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOut,‚Äù I said, walking past her. ‚ÄúTo find my connection. Don‚Äôt wait up.‚ÄùI walked out of the apartment without saying another word. I didn‚Äôt slam the door or look back. I just put my hoodie on and stepped outside. My hands were shaking, but I kept my head up. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going. I just knew I had to get out of there. Staying in that room, pretending everything was okay, wasn‚Äôt an option anymore.

I walked down the street, breathing in the cold air, trying to clear my head. My phone was buzzing in my pocket, probably her, but I ignored it. I wasn‚Äôt ready to face whatever she wanted to say.

I stopped at a small convenience store, bought a bottle of water, and sat on the curb for a moment. I felt lost, but also certain that leaving was the right choice. I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending like nothing was wrong, especially when she couldn‚Äôt even tell me where she‚Äôd been.

After a few minutes, I stood up and started walking again. I didn‚Äôt have a plan, but I needed to keep moving. It was the first time in a long time that I put myself first, even if it hurt.After walking for a bit, I found myself scrolling through my contacts, fingers hovering over a name I hadn‚Äôt messaged in a while. I wasn‚Äôt even sure why I wanted to reach out, but I knew I needed someone‚Äîsomeone who wouldn‚Äôt judge or ask a million questions.

I called her. She picked up on the second ring.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, voice barely steady.

‚ÄúHey. What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù she asked immediately.

I hesitated for a second, then just let it out‚Äîthe distance, the silence, the way she left without a word, and how I felt like I was being pushed out of my own life.

She listened. No interruptions. No advice right away, just quiet understanding on the other end. And honestly, that was exactly what I needed.

We made plans to meet up later, and for the first time in days, I felt a little less alone.Later that day, I found myself walking into the little caf√© we used to go to‚Äîthe one with the quiet corners and the old vinyl records hanging on the walls. It felt familiar, safe, even though everything inside me was anything but. When I saw her waiting there, I felt a wave of relief. Not because I had answers, but because I knew someone was willing to just be there without asking me to be okay.

We ordered coffee, and I let my hands wrap around the warm cup like it could somehow hold the pieces of me that felt broken. I started telling her about everything‚Äîthe silence from my girlfriend, the way she left without a word, how I stayed up all night waiting, and the emptiness I felt when she finally came home and couldn‚Äôt even meet my eyes.

I told her how confused I was, how I kept replaying every moment, every look, every text, trying to find where everything went wrong. I told her how I wanted to scream but couldn‚Äôt, how I wanted to run but didn‚Äôt know where, and how badly I needed to just breathe without feeling guilty for it.

She didn‚Äôt say much. She just listened. Sometimes she nodded. Sometimes she reached across the table and squeezed my hand. And honestly, that was everything I needed. Not answers. Not advice. Just someone who wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Outside, my phone buzzed over and over. Messages from my girlfriend‚Äîsimple words, apologies, questions. But I didn‚Äôt look. I didn‚Äôt want to rush back into that confusion. I was tired of feeling like I had to choose between loving her and loving myself.

For the first time in a long time, I felt a small flicker of something I hadn‚Äôt felt in weeks‚Äîpeace. Not because the situation was fixed, but because I was starting to realize that maybe, just maybe, I deserved more than silence and secrets.
