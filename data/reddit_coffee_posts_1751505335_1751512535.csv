So I had a mostly peaceful shift until I encountered a semi-recurring customer with a small-ish service dog (I won't doxx the dog bc they didn't do anything wrong to me) with white curly fur. 

Elderly AH decided to open her transaction with me by asking in her own way if I was sleepy. I know this bc she ALWAYS asks me this every time I ring her up. I could have decided to refuse her but so far she hasn't done anything to piss me off. So I responded with ""Come up with better material, lady- it's not funny"". So she was quiet for a few more seconds until she asked me again. I apologized for my remark and begrudgingly rung her up until I handed over her change and reciept. Meanwhile her service doggo wandered off and Elderly AH decided to throw a hissy fit over the dirty dollar I gave her. 

So I ended up having to borrow my supervisor's card so I can exchange the dirty dollar she didn't want. Elderly AH didn't thank me and fucked off- and she knew that I hated that jab towards my eyes and is most likely aware of me getting fired if I tried anything. I also asked my coworkers if I looked sleepy after the transaction and unfortunately, I did look sleepy even with coffee. 

On a side note, I ended up having to tell my next several customers that my tired/sleepy/angry face looks the same and is my default face. 

I also forgot I can indeed refuse customers but I'm not able to refuse customers for being AH bc some of those times were when I was being an AH bc of my rbf. ",1,1751512412.0,retailhell,0,1.0,False

Hopefully this is a good place to look for advice.  I've asked in a few other places and got some good advice from guys, but am looking for broader advice from men and women.

I'm 46M and have a 47F cousin who I've been reconnecting with in the last few years.  We've been leaning on each other for social and emotional support more and more. About a year ago, we both found out that we have been in open and other forms of alternative relationships and are both a bit kinky, sharing stories of our exploits.

Instead of our previous going out for coffee, she's been lately inviting me to coffee at her apartment, but we sit opposite ends of the sofa.  I had mentioned holding hands for comfort and support but she said she doesn't like holding hands.

A few months ago, she made reference to someone who was going to smack her butt. I said something like, ""I'd like to do that.""  She told me, ""You should.""  So I did.  Now nearly every time we greet, I smack or grab it really quick.  A couple times ago, I gave it a long and solid squeeze and she said, ""Ohhhh, ok!"" or something like that.   We also had lunch with her sister from out of town and on the restaurant patio, they both encouraged me to smack their butts (longer story in an earlier post in my profile).

I was able to get her to join me in a hot tub about a week ago, and I decided to take off my trunks, which she encouraged.  But when I said she could strip too, she just said, ""Yeah, I could.""  But she didn't.

Couple days later, her sister said she heard about the hot tub and wants to go with me next time she's in town. Main cousin of the story keeps saying over text it was fun.  They're obviously talking about me.

We're planning to go to the hot tub again tomorrow.

I don't want to screw this up.  I have immense feelings for her as a person and as a relative, and she's a huge emotional support now.  But I can't make sense of the small intimate acts that she seems ok with or even likes, and I don't know how far to push it without risking screwing it up.

Is she just a little untraditional like me or is she dropping hints and is as worried about what I'll think as I am worried about what she thinks?",1,1751511657.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

Long story: 

My partner and I wanted to adopt an adult dog as a companion for my 6 year old Pomeranian as we are both full time workers and he is a ball of energy so we surmised that getting an adult friend for him, might tire him out a little as we felt guilty not playing with him as often as he wanted to. 
We also start work very early so there aren't any day cares that were open that we could of taken him to. 
We ended up finding a dog that was advertised online (not a breeder), 2 years old, same breed (Pomeranian) so went and saw her and made the impulsive decision to adopt without asking all the appropriate questions. 
We found out she had been abused, suffered from separation anxiety and more than likely, had been kept as an outside dog (i.e. not toilet trained). 
But... my 6 year old Pomeranian gets along with her quite well, which was a positive. 
After getting in a dog trainer to help with some of her issues, we thought things would be smooth sailing.. Wrong. 
She has almost gone backwards. As I mentioned, my partner and I work full time and when we come home we don't have much time left in the day other than to have dinner and go to bed so we have been really struggling with the following: 

1. Toilet training
 During the day both dogs are kept in the laundry with a dog door that allows them outside to a small run, 3m roughly, to use as a toilet or fresh air. But for the past month or so, she has been urinating inside but poops outside. We use the proper cleaners to clean up but she still goes inside almost daily. 

She does pee outside but cant understand why out of the however many times she goes during the day, she still goes inside. 
We have also tried crate training during the times we are home and it works for a couple of days / a week and then she will even go in her crate, despite just having been outside or free roam to go outside. 

2. Behaviour 
 She was abused at some point by her previous owners so whenever we at all express any frustration or try to physically move her off a seat or off our laps, she yelps blue murder, loudly! And we definitely are not doing anything to cause that.. It makes us feel terrible and even more frustrated at the situation because we aren't hurting her or doing anything wrong. 

She is food obsessed. Which is okay to a degree but she will go for anything, my vape was left on the arm chair and she hopped up and chewed it. I had a full cup of takeaway coffee on the coffee table and she pulled it off onto the carpeted floor. 

My partner is 95% settled on the decision that we should rehome her but I just don't want to feel like we've not tried all options first. 

Any help with the above would be super appreciated.

I add this because I know AMAB people *technically* have slower brain/maturity development, though idk if that matters at our age.

Also, this partner and I have been together for 11 years.

I work full time. My job doesn't pay great, but it pays more than enough to cover me when everything is split between me and my two partners (yes we are poly and we all live together, but this has only happened in recent months).

A few years ago, after a lot of discussion with my partner (let's call her H) I left my job due to terrible manager bullying and a toxic environment, and went to study my dream course at university. As discussed, H (partially) financially supported me while I was on government benefits. I am a pretty frugal person, I'm not really big on spending money on myself, so most of my money went to rent/bills/groceries.

Before the end of my course, H started to think about medically transitioning, and decided she needed to take a break from work to do so. I was supportive of this, and I got a full time job while still studying full time so that I could support her.

It's been 18-ish months now, and I myself have just started medically transitioning and am dealing with some horrible people at work, etc, which sucks but I'm dealing with it how I can. With my new hormone expenses and H's hormones, plus antidepressants for both of us and expenses for our cats, I am struggling to make ends meet.

Recently things got a little bit better when we moved in with our other partner, so now things are split 3 ways. Unfortunately our rent is now more expensive, but if I pay only for myself it is cheaper than our old situation. The issue here is because I'm paying for both me and H, everything is even more expensive.

I guess the problem is we have discussed a lot that I don't have enough money to cover everything. H agreed to get a job by the start of April and start covering her share of everything. She still has not found one.

I pay for most of her groceries and bills because she is on government benefits and barely makes enough to cover her share of rent. The issue is I feel like I'm drowning in expenses and I don't know what to do about it.

I've been helping H by assisting her with looking for work, helping read over her resume and sharing job opportunities with her. She HAS been applying, but I feel that she isn't taking it seriously.

I guess the biggest problem is that when she gets paid she transfers me money for rent and whatever bills are OVERdue (i.e. they have come out of my pocket) and then spends her money on video games or other luxuries, leaving me to cover groceries and be out of pocket for everything else. *Technically* she owes me money, but I'm not chasing this up as I know she doesn't have it and I WANT to support her, I just don't have the finances to do so.

I've been trying to encourage her to save money by getting public transport instead of driving, not buying unnecessary food items (like buying coffee out instead of making it at home, or buying food rather than cooking) but she gets really upset with me and tells me I'm being rude and manipulative. I can't cut her off because that would make me heartless seeing as she cannot afford to pay her way right now, but I don't know what to do.

Honestly you can probably tell my thoughts are all over the place with this, and I just need some sort of advice because I don't know how to deal with this situation.

Jonah grips the steering wheel tighter as he pulls into the parking lot of Fairoaks Psychiatric Hospital. His pulse is still hammering from the tunnels, from the unseen hands that brushed against his skin, from the voice that whispered to him in the dark. The marks on his arms are still there, faint smudges shaped like fingerprints, refusing to rub away.



His mind barely registers the hospital‚Äôs cold, gray exterior‚Äîhe‚Äôs still thinking about what Marco told him.



Beth Farron, Julia‚Äôs mother, was found outside the thrift store, raving about a scarred woman, clawing at her own skin.



Jonah takes a slow breath, steadying himself. He is investigating her daughter‚Äôs disappearance. He needs to speak to Beth. She might have answers.



Inside, the hospital smells of antiseptic and old tile. He approaches the front desk, flashing his old badge out of habit.



""I need to see Beth Farron,"" he says.



The nurse barely looks up. ""Psych hold. No visitors unless authorized.""



Jonah leans in. ""I‚Äôm working her daughter‚Äôs case. Julia Farron‚Äîmissing person. I think Beth knows something.""



The name makes the nurse hesitate. Recognition flickers in her face. She nods and picks up the phone.



Minutes later, Dr. Monroe approaches‚Äîa lanky man with deep-set eyes.



""Jonah Thorson?"" Monroe asks, glancing at his notes. ""Beth mentioned your name before she was sedated.""



Jonah stiffens. ""She did?""



""Not directly,"" Monroe clarifies. ""She kept saying, ‚ÄòHe knows. He‚Äôs seen it too.‚Äô And then‚Ä¶"" His voice lowers. ""She started whispering a name. Onoskelis.""



Jonah‚Äôs blood turns to ice.



Monroe motions for him to follow. ""She‚Äôs calm now, but I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîshe‚Äôs not well.""



They walk down a sterile hallway lined with locked doors. Inside, figures mutter, rock back and forth, stare at the ceiling with vacant eyes.



Monroe stops at Room 23.



""She hasn‚Äôt spoken since we sedated her,"" he says, pushing open the door.



Beth Farron sits by the window, staring blankly outside. The dim light washes over her frail, trembling hands‚Äîhands covered in scratches and bruises. But Jonah‚Äôs stomach lurches when he sees what‚Äôs carved into her arm.



A symbol. Deep. Fresh. Deliberate.



The same symbol Julia traced on her locker.



The same one Jonah unknowingly drew on his desk.



Jonah swallows hard. ""Has she been restrained?""



Monroe nods. ""We caught her trying to dig into her own skin with her fingernails. It‚Äôs like she was trying to carve something out of herself.""



Jonah steps forward cautiously. ""Beth?""



Her head turns slowly, eyes hollow and sunken, lips barely parted.



For a long moment, she just stares at him.



Then, she whispers, ""It‚Äôs too late.""



Jonah‚Äôs spine stiffens. ""Too late for what?""



Beth‚Äôs breathing is shallow. Her fingers twitch against the hospital gown. ""She‚Äôs in me.""



Jonah meets Monroe‚Äôs uneasy gaze. He kneels beside her chair, lowering his voice.



""Beth‚Äîwho is in you?""



Beth trembles violently. ""She whispers when I sleep. She touches my hands, my face. I see her in the mirror."" Her voice drops to a whisper. ""I thought I could stop it. I thought if I gave her something, she‚Äôd leave me alone.""



Jonah‚Äôs stomach clenches. ""Gave her what?""



Beth slowly turns her arms upward, exposing more scratches.



Some are words.



""For Julia.""



""For Jonah.""



""For Her.""



Jonah feels his throat tighten.



Beth‚Äôs eyes begin to dart around the room like something invisible is circling her. Monroe shifts uncomfortably.



Then Beth suddenly jerks forward, grabbing Jonah‚Äôs wrist with startling strength.



Her fingernails dig into his skin.



Jonah flinches. ""Beth‚Äî!""



She leans in close, her voice barely a breath.



""She‚Äôs watching us right now.""



Jonah‚Äôs skin crawls.



Beth‚Äôs gaze flicks past him, to the darkened mirror on the far wall.



Jonah slowly follows her gaze‚Äî



‚Äîand sees something standing behind him.



A woman. Scarred. Smiling.



His heart slams into his ribs.



Beth‚Äôs body jerks violently, like something just yanked her back.



Monroe reaches for the emergency call button‚Äî



Beth screams.



A raw, unearthly scream that makes the lights flicker.



Jonah tries to grab her arms, but she thrashes wildly‚Äî

Twice.



Three times.

Then‚Äîsilence.



Beth collapses forward, her body trembling.



Jonah scrambles to catch her‚Äî""Beth, hold on!""‚Äîbut as she lifts her face, her lips are curling into a faint, eerie smile.



Then, with a final, shuddering breath‚Äî



Beth goes still.



The flatline rings in Jonah‚Äôs ears.



A cold presence lingers in the air.



Jonah staggers backward, his pulse hammering, his breath sharp and uneven.



His gaze flickers to the mirror.

Chapter 21 ‚Äì The Mark Follows

Jonah sits in his car, gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turn white. The hospital looms behind him, but his mind is still trapped inside Room 23, replaying the moment Beth‚Äôs skull cracked against the wall. The sound‚Äîthat sickening crunch‚Äîwon‚Äôt leave him.



Neither will the text message.



""You can‚Äôt help her.""



The words glow on his phone‚Äôs screen, taunting him.



Jonah stares at it, his breath shallow.



Who sent this? Julia? Onoskelis? Someone else?



A part of him wants to dismiss it‚Äîsome sick joke, maybe someone who heard about Beth's breakdown. But no. He knows better.



Because even now, he feels it.



Something followed him out of that hospital.



His reflection moves.

Jonah catches it in the rearview mirror.



Not him. Not exactly.



His reflection is a second behind, slower, like it's studying him.



Then‚Äîits head tilts, just slightly.



Jonah spins in his seat. The back of the car is empty.



He exhales sharply, runs a shaking hand through his hair.



Get a grip, Thorson.



He unlocks his phone, forces himself to scroll past the text. He needs help. He needs someone who understands this kind of thing.



Margot. Caldwell.



Jonah dials Margot first.



She picks up on the third ring. ""Jonah?""



His voice is tight. ""I need to see you. And Caldwell. Now.""



A pause. Then, a note of concern. ""What happened?""



Jonah swallows. ""Beth Farron. She‚Äôs dead.""



Silence.



When Margot speaks again, her voice is hushed, almost cautious.



""Where are you?""



Jonah glances at the hospital. The lights in the windows seem too dim now, like the building is sinking into shadow.



""Leaving Fairoaks.""



Margot doesn‚Äôt hesitate. ""Come to my place. Bring whatever you found in the tunnels.""



Jonah hangs up, pulls out of the parking lot. He should call Marco, update him, but not yet.



Not until he understands what the hell just happened.



Margot‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì The Weight of the Effigy

Jonah knocks twice before Margot opens the door.



She doesn‚Äôt greet him right away. Instead, she stands in the threshold, wafting a brazier filled with burning sage and sweetgrass, her expression tight with concern. The fragrant smoke curls around him, clinging to his clothes, seeping into his skin. The scent is sharp but warm, grounding. A ward against spirits.



Jonah lifts a brow. ""This necessary?""



Margot nods grimly. ""I don‚Äôt take chances anymore.""



Jonah steps inside, letting the smoke roll over him. He should find it ridiculous, but after what happened at the hospital‚Äî\*\*after what happened in the tunnels‚Äî\*\*he welcomes it.



The apartment smells of herbs, incense, and something metallic underneath. The dim lighting makes the clutter of books, relics, and symbols scrawled on parchment look almost ritualistic in its arrangement.



Margot sets the brazier down on the wooden table between them. ""Take off your jacket.""



Jonah hesitates. ""Why?""



Margot gives him a look. ""Because I need to see if anything followed you.""



Jonah exhales through his nose but obliges, shrugging out of his coat and tossing it over the back of a chair. Margot moves closer, fingers hovering just over his forearm without touching, like she‚Äôs feeling for something unseen.



Then, her expression darkens.



""Jonah‚Ä¶"" she murmurs, tilting his arm slightly to examine the smudged fingerprints still clinging to his skin. She traces a symbol in the air above them, lips moving silently. The marks don‚Äôt fade.



Jonah watches her face. ""That bad?""



Margot meets his eyes. ""You didn‚Äôt just see something in the tunnels, did you?""



Jonah swallows. ""No.""



She gestures to the bag slung over his shoulder. ""You brought it?""



Jonah doesn‚Äôt have to ask what she means. He unzips the bag and pulls out the effigy. It‚Äôs still wrapped in cloth, but even without touching it directly, Jonah feels it.



A weight. A pulse.



Margot hesitates before unwrapping it.



Dr. Caldwell, who has been silent until now, leans forward with a skeptical sigh.



""Alright, let‚Äôs not get carried away,"" Caldwell says, adjusting his glasses. ""You‚Äôre both talking about this thing like it has an inherent power. Artifacts like this‚Äîwhile culturally significant‚Äîdon‚Äôt hold any real influence beyond what people assign to them.""



Margot shoots him an irritated glance. ""Then why don‚Äôt you touch it, professor?""



Caldwell folds his arms. ""Because it's old, likely unsanitary, and possibly covered in lead paint, if the charring is any indication. I‚Äôd rather not take home tetanus or a fungal infection.""



Jonah smirks despite himself. ""Glad to know you're keeping an open mind, Doc.""



Caldwell waves a dismissive hand. ""Look, I‚Äôm here because I respect you both, and I want to help interpret whatever historical context might be at play. But let‚Äôs be rational‚Äîsymbols don‚Äôt move, whispers don‚Äôt come from wood, and spirits don‚Äôt leave voicemail messages.""



Margot glares. ""Tell that to Beth Farron.""



The mention of Beth makes the room fall silent.



Caldwell sighs, rubbing his temple. ""Beth was suffering from a psychological break, Jonah. It‚Äôs tragic, but let‚Äôs not assign supernatural meaning to something that already has a logical explanation. Trauma. Guilt. Psychosis. These things manifest in ways we don‚Äôt fully understand, but they don‚Äôt require demons to exist.""



Jonah exhales slowly. He doesn‚Äôt know what he believes anymore. But he knows what he saw.



Margot unwraps the effigy, and the second it‚Äôs exposed‚Äî



The air seems to shift.



Jonah swears he feels pressure. Like a shift in atmospheric weight.



Caldwell leans in, squinting at the carvings. ""These markings‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt just protection sigils. They‚Äôre a form of binding.""



Margot crosses her arms. ""Binding what, exactly?""



Caldwell hesitates for a fraction of a second before saying, ""A belief. A concept. This was likely used in a ritual meant to either invoke or contain something within a specific cultural framework. It‚Äôs common in older civilizations‚ÄîEgyptians, Mesopotamians, even some early European pagan groups. But it‚Äôs not magic, it‚Äôs symbolism. A way of externalizing control over something people feared.""



Jonah watches him closely. ""So you‚Äôre saying this was meant to‚Ä¶ trap something?""



Caldwell shakes his head. ""Not literally. More like a psychological safeguard. A way of saying, ‚ÄòWe control this, not the other way around.‚Äô It gives people power over their fears.""



Margot scoffs. ""Then why does it feel like it‚Äôs still holding onto something?""



Caldwell doesn‚Äôt answer immediately.



Instead, he reaches out‚Äîbarely grazing the surface with his fingertips.



The second his skin touches it‚Äî



Every candle in the apartment flickers.



The room feels smaller.



Jonah‚Äôs breath turns visible. Cold.



Margot snatches Caldwell‚Äôs hand away from the effigy. ""Don‚Äôt touch it!""



Caldwell pulls back, exhaling sharply. ""That was a coincidence,"" he mutters, though his voice lacks conviction. ""Airflow change. Draft in the room.""



Margot‚Äôs stare is unforgiving. ""Say it again. Say it like you believe it.""



Caldwell removes his glasses, rubbing his eyes. ""I‚Äôm just saying‚Äîthere‚Äôs always an explanation. Always.""



Jonah leans against the table. ""Then explain what‚Äôs happening to me.""



Caldwell hesitates, watching the effigy. ""You believe something is happening. Your mind is reinforcing it. Fear, repetition, pattern recognition‚Äîit‚Äôs how belief systems take hold. But beliefs, Jonah‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt make things real.""



Jonah clenches his jaw. ""Then why do I feel like something is watching me even now?""



Caldwell has no answer.



Margot crosses the room, grabbing another bundle of herbs and lighting it. She waves the smoke around Jonah, her movements slow, methodical.



""You don‚Äôt have to believe in something for it to mark you,"" she says softly. ""You just have to let it in.""



Later That Night ‚Äì The Vision

Jonah stares at the effigy on his desk, the apartment silent around him.



Margot told him not to touch it again.



Caldwell told him to burn it.



Jonah does neither.



He just watches it.



His body feels wrong. Heavy. His limbs don‚Äôt belong to him.



The hum starts again.



Soft. Deep. Crawling through his skull.



Jonah blinks‚Äî



And he‚Äôs somewhere else.



The Altar. The Darkness. The Voice.

The walls pulse. Symbols shift and rearrange themselves.



The altar stands before him.



Jonah can‚Äôt move.



He hears whispers.



He turns‚Äî



And she is there.



Onoskelis.



Scarred. Smiling.



She moves toward him slowly, the air around her rippling like heat waves.



Jonah‚Äôs chest tightens. He tries to step back‚Äîbut his feet won‚Äôt obey.



Her hand reaches out.



Brushes against his chest.



Jonah gasps. It feels like fingers pressing through his ribs.



Her lips curl into something mocking, hungry.



""You are mine.""



The room shatters around him.



Jonah jerks awake. The effigy is in his hands.



Unwrapped.



His phone buzzes.



Unknown Number:



""Brother, I found you.""



Chapter 22 ‚Äì The Bloodline



Jonah drops the effigy.



It thuds against the wooden floor, but the sound is \*\*wrong‚Äî\*\*muffled, as if the weight of it sinks deeper than it should.



His eyes flick to his phone. The words are still there.



""Brother, I found you.""



Jonah‚Äôs pulse hammers against his ribs.



No.



This can‚Äôt be her.



His sister is dead.



The past claws its way forward. The night she disappeared. The way the adults talked about it in hushed tones. The way no one ever found her.



Jonah swallows hard, his fingers hovering over the screen. He types:



""Who is this?""



Seconds stretch into eternity. The phone remains silent.



Then‚Äî



The screen flickers.



The reply comes through.



""Come find me.""



A location link follows.



Jonah clicks it before he can stop himself. His stomach drops.



Old Sacramento.



Deep in the tunnels.



Where he barely escaped with his sanity intact.



Jonah tightens his grip on the phone. His body feels off, like his limbs don‚Äôt belong to him anymore. He rubs his arms absentmindedly‚Äî



The smudges are still there. Warm. Itchy. He rubs at them, desperate, like an addict clawing at an old wound.



Margot was right.



The mark followed him.



Jonah sucks in a sharp breath, turning away from the phone like it might lash out at him.



This is a trap.  The walls of his apartment feel like they are closing in on him, the shadows moving about with a life of their own.



It has to be.



His phone buzzes again.



Jonah doesn‚Äôt check it. Instead, he grabs his keys and heads for the only person who might have answers.



Margot‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì The Truth Comes Out



Margot barely has time to react before Jonah is inside, shutting the door behind him with too much force.



She doesn‚Äôt yell at him for barging in.



She takes one look at him and asks ""What's wrong Jonah?""  He shoves his phone at her. 



""Read it.""



Margot takes the phone, scanning the message.



A confused look appears across her face.  She clearly doesn't understand the context of the message

Jonah drags a hand down his face. ""Explain this. Explain how I got this message from my sister?  She's been missing for 25 years!  The same damn night I saw Beth die. Explain why it feels like I‚Äôm not alone even when I‚Äôm standing in an empty goddamn room.""



Margot sat down, speaking  carefully. ""Jonah‚Ä¶ you've never mentioned a sister before.""



Jonah‚Äôs jaw tightens, he doesn't want say it, he doesn't want to relive the memory of loosing his older sister.  As if he once he talks about it, it becomes real and he won't ever be able to find her.



He exhales sharply, running a shaking hand through his hair.



""When I was eight, my sister disappeared."" His voice is low, measured, detached.



Margot stills. ""Disappeared?""



Jonah nods.



""It was‚Ä¶ strange. There was no forced entry. No struggle. It was like she just‚Ä¶ vanished. No body. No evidence. No answers.""



Margot grips the edge of the table. ""Jesus, Jonah.""



Jonah swallows hard. ""I don‚Äôt talk about it. Not even to Marco. Because what‚Äôs the point? She‚Äôs gone. And I made peace with that a long time ago.""  A brief memory of the missing posters. The whispers of the neighbors. His mother leaving the porch light on every night for a year flashed before his eyes.



Margot‚Äôs voice softens. ""Until now.""



Jonah nods once. His voice drops. ""Until now.""



Margot‚Äôs gaze drifts back to the phone. ""You think this is her?""



Jonah sat there silent, his head in his hands.  Unsure of what was happening to him at the moment.  He didn't know what to think any more.  A part of him, wanted to believe that his sister was still out there trying to find her way home, but he knew the odds. 



Margot steps forward, her voice gentle but firm.



""Jonah, listen to me. Whatever this is, it is not your sister. It‚Äôs using her. It wants you back down there.""



Jonah clenched his fists. The outline of tears running down his face, highlighted by the dim lighting in her apartment.  ""Then what the hell am I supposed to do? Pretend it‚Äôs not happening?"" 



""Yes!"" Margot snaps. ""Because if you go, you won‚Äôt come back!""



The words slam into him.



Jonah exhales sharply, turning away.



Margot softens, stepping closer. ""Jonah‚Ä¶ I know what it‚Äôs like to want to believe. I do. But you have to trust me‚Äîthis thing is feeding off you. It‚Äôs in your head now. It‚Äôll keep pulling you back until there‚Äôs nothing left of you.""



Jonah stared at the window.



His reflection doesn‚Äôt move.



Margot sees his face. She grabs her phone.



""I‚Äôm calling Caldwell.""



Jonah scoffs. ""What‚Äôs he gonna do? Call me delusional?""



Margot doesn‚Äôt blink. ""Yes. And we need that right now.""



Jonah exhales through his nose. He nods once.



Margot dials.



Jonah stares at his reflection.



It still hasn‚Äôt moved.



Dr. Caldwell‚Äôs Office ‚Äì A Scholar‚Äôs Doubt



Caldwell leans back in his chair, adjusting his glasses with a sigh.



""So let me get this straight."" His tone is calm, clinical.



""You believe the entity‚Äî\*\*the one associated with Julia‚Äôs disappearance, the one linked to Beth‚Äôs death, the one Margot insists exists despite all logic‚Äî\*\*is now communicating with you. Personally.""



Jonah glares. ""It‚Äôs not a belief. It‚Äôs a fact.""



Caldwell nods slowly. ""I see. And your evidence?""



Jonah throws his phone on the desk.



Caldwell glances at the message.



""Brother, I found you.""



Caldwell exhales through his nose. ""How do you know this isn‚Äôt a hoax?""



Jonah‚Äôs jaw tightened as he tried to restrain himself. ""Because, I haven't spoken about this to anyone in years!  I saw something at the hospital, Doc. I saw something in my mirror. And I saw it in yours, too."" 



Dr. Caldwell removed his glasses and began cleaning them while he talked. But Jonah noticed the slight change in his tone, and the tension in his shoulders, almost as if doubt had crept in to his analytical mind. 



Margot cuts in. ""Caldwell. Stop pretending. You touched that effigy, and something happened. You felt it.""



Caldwell looks away. ""Psychosomatic response. Environmental suggestion. Fear creates the illusion of manifestation.""



Margot scoffs. ""Tell that to Beth Farron.""



Caldwell exhales sharply.



Jonah leans forward. His voice is like stone.



""If this isn‚Äôt real, Doc‚Äîwhy do I feel it watching me even now?""



Caldwell doesn‚Äôt answer.



Margot grips Jonah‚Äôs arm. ""Let‚Äôs go.""



Jonah‚Äôs Apartment ‚Äì The Nightmare



Jonah barely made it inside his apartment, hyperventilating he tried to slow his breathing down.  But the air felt wrong.  It was heavy.  He noticed the shadows in corners, they weren't just dark.  They had a depth to them, like a person waiting for him.  Panic over taking him, he rushed to the bathroom sink and splashing water on his face.   



He looked in the mirror expecting to see himself looking back.  But that wasn't what he saw, his reflection was facing the wrong direction, it was looking away from him.  He gripped the sink, his knuckles white from the strain.  The head twisted unnaturally around slowly, and the sound like bones grinding together.  When he could see the face looking back at him it wasn't his own but hers, Onoskelis. 



Jonah stumbled out of the bathroom falling to his knees before the vision takes him.



He falls to his knees.



The hum is deafening now.



The walls pulse. The air tightens. The apartment is gone. The altar is in front of him. The symbols move, shifting like they‚Äôre alive. Jonah looks down and he see's himself standing in front of the altar.  His hands stained a dark red with blood, screaming.  And she is there.  



Onoskelis.



Scarred. Smiling. Waiting.



Jonah tries to move, but his body won‚Äôt obey.



Her fingers drift toward his chest.  The pressure digs in.



Jonah gasps, choking‚Äî



His ribs crack.



Jonah felt her hands wrapping around his chest, he felt the warmth in her breath as she spoke.

""Brother. You found me, and I will never let you go.....""  The words wrapped around him like a snake suffocating it's prey.

For a brief second, Jonah was so happy. Maybe the happiest he had ever been.

His sister was here. He could feel her warmth. He could smell her‚Äîsun-kissed and wild, like grass after the rain.

Tears burned in his eyes. His voice cracked when he whispered:

""I found you.""

The arms around him tightened.

At first, it felt comforting. Protective.

Then the grip grew stronger. Too strong.

The warmth became heat. The embrace, a trap.

Jonah‚Äôs breath hitched.

""I will never let you go,"" she whispered, and this time, it wasn‚Äôt his sister‚Äôs voice.



Then his world shatters.



Jonah jerks awake.



The effigy is in his hands.



Unwrapped.



His phone buzzes.



Unknown Number:



""We were so close, couldn't you feel it.""



Chapter 23

Jonah woke on the floor of his apartment, the bathroom light still on. His body felt wrong‚Äîtoo heavy, like something was pressing down on him. His limbs ached, stiff from the cold, hard floor. When he inhaled, his ribs protested, the phantom pressure from last night‚Äôs vision still lingering.



He forced himself upright, swaying for a moment before steadying against the doorframe.



The nightmares clung to him, the sensation of her hands still lingering on his chest, phantom fingers pressing through flesh and bone. But the morning light‚Äîthin and gray‚Äîseeped through the blinds, chasing away the shadows that had swallowed him whole the night before.



He exhaled shakily. Still here.



He stumbled into the kitchen, every movement sluggish, like wading through water. Routine. That‚Äôs what he needed. Something normal. Something tangible.



Jonah filled the kettle and placed it on the stove, the click of the burner sparking to life grounding him. Opening the jar of coffee grounds, he added an extra scoop, as if the bitterness might carve away the fog in his brain.



He leaned against the painted cast iron sink, hands gripping the edge until his knuckles turned white. He stared at the faucet, watching a slow drip of water slide down the porcelain, the silence between drops stretching long and heavy.



He tried to rationalize the past twenty-four hours. Tried.



The tunnels.

Beth.

The text message.

The reflection that wasn‚Äôt his own.

The vision.

His stomach churned.



The whistle of the kettle jolted him back. He turned, shaking off the weight pressing against his ribs. He poured the hot water over the coffee grounds, steam curling upward, the scent rich and familiar.



Jonah closed his eyes, inhaling deeply.



For a moment‚Äîjust a moment‚Äîhe let himself believe that this was enough. That the warmth of the kitchen, the smell of coffee, the morning sun creeping through the blinds meant he was just Jonah Thorson again.



Not marked.

Not hunted.

Not standing on the edge of something he couldn‚Äôt comprehend.



But the moment passed.



The quiet felt unnatural now, like something waiting to be filled.



Jonah grabbed his phone from the counter, hesitating before unlocking the screen. He already knew what he would see. The message from the unknown number.



""We were so close, couldn't you feel it?""



His throat tightened.



He pushed past the nausea, scrolled to Marco‚Äôs contact, and pressed call.



The dial tone hummed in his ear, breaking the silence of the morning.



Jonah rubbed his face, exhaustion weighing him down. The world around him still felt wrong. Stretched. Unfamiliar.



His gaze drifted to his hands as he waited for Marco to pick up.

""Bueno,"" Marco said as he answered the phone. In the background, Jonah could hear laughter, clattering plates, the muffled hum of a morning radio. Life.



For a second, he had forgotten what that sounded like.



""Marco,"" Jonah said, his voice rougher than expected. He hesitated, then exhaled through his nose. ""What are you doing later this morning? I need to talk to you.""



The warmth in Marco‚Äôs voice faded, replaced by something more serious.



""Hermano, what's wrong?"" He paused, then added, ""Don't lie to me either. I'll know‚Äîyou know my abuela had the sight."" Marco said jokingly. 



Jonah‚Äôs stomach tightened. He wanted to lie, to downplay it, but what was the point?



He gave Marco a brief, clipped rundown of the last 24 hours‚Äîthe tunnels, Beth, the message, the vision. He left out how it felt. The weight in his bones. The way the shadows felt different now.



Marco didn‚Äôt interrupt. He just listened. When Jonah finally stopped talking, Marco let out a long breath.



""Meet me at the diner on 8th in an hour,"" Marco said, voice steady. ""We'll talk there.""



Jonah nodded, even though Marco couldn't see him. ""Yeah. Thanks, man.""



""Siempre, hermano.""



Jonah hung up and leaned back against the counter, rubbing his eyes. Marco would help. He always did.



But as Jonah exhaled, his hand drifted down to his forearm. His fingers brushed the marks.



Still there.



His stomach tightened.



Jonah turned toward the sink, gripping the edge as he stared at his hands under the dim kitchen light. The smudges hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, they looked darker now, sinking deeper into his skin.



He rubbed at them, harder this time. A slow, sticky warmth spread beneath his fingertips‚Äîlike oil seeping into a wound.



A faint nausea curled in his stomach.



Jonah‚Äôs gaze flickered to the window above the sink. His reflection looked back at him‚Äîtired, pale, distant.



Then‚Äî



Something moved behind him.



Not much. Just enough.



A shadow, barely shifting. Like something stretching. Waking up.



A breath of cold air curled against the back of his neck.



Jonah stiffened, his pulse spiking‚Äî



Don‚Äôt turn around, he told himself, shifting his arm to shield his ribcage.



The thought came unbidden. Instinctual. Like an old fear waking up inside him.



He turned anyway.



Nothing.



Just his empty apartment.



The air felt still, but something had changed.



Jonah‚Äôs fingers drifted back to the smudges. They weren‚Äôt just stains.



They were sinking into him.



Deeper. Itching. Burning.



Not just on his skin. Beneath it.



Spreading.



Growing.



Jonah inhaled sharply, glancing at the window‚Äôs reflection‚Äî



‚Äîand froze.



His reflection stood exactly as it should. Except for one thing.



Its arm wasn‚Äôt shielding its ribs.



It stood there, completely exposed.



Watching him.



The nausea twisted sharper. Jonah swallowed hard, ripping his gaze away.



The smudges crawled across his skin, slow and patient.



Growing, like coral slowly crawling and expanding across the ocean floor. Consuming what was once Jonah Thorson.



And he wasn‚Äôt sure they would ever stop.



Chapter 24

Jonah left his apartment early, needing to put distance between himself and the walls that had begun to feel more like a prison.



The drive down the damp streets of downtown provided him with a minor semblance of clarity‚Äîa grounding he desperately needed.



The city still moved as it always did. Cars honked, pedestrians shuffled along wet sidewalks, neon signs flickered against puddles in the gutters. Life moved forward.



But inside Jonah, something had stalled.



He gripped the steering wheel tighter, flexing his fingers against the leather, feeling the marks beneath his sleeves. Still there. He hadn‚Äôt checked, not since the kitchen. Didn‚Äôt need to. He could feel them.



Burning. Itching. Sinking.



His reflection in the rearview mirror felt off.



Not delayed, not distorted. But wrong in a way he couldn‚Äôt quite name.



Jonah forced himself to look away. Just drive.



The Diner on 8th

Marco was already at their usual booth, stirring his coffee, watching the door like he‚Äôd been expecting Jonah before he even walked in.



Jonah slid into the seat across from him, shoulders tense.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early,‚Äù he muttered.



Marco smirked, shaking his head. ‚ÄúAnd you look like shit.‚Äù



Jonah huffed a humorless laugh, rubbing a hand down his face. ‚ÄúFeel like it too.‚Äù



The waitress appeared with a fresh cup of coffee and set it in front of him without a word. He wrapped his hands around it, letting the heat seep into his fingers.



Marco watched him. Not pushing, just waiting.



Jonah exhaled sharply.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna think I‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù



Marco leaned back in the booth, tilting his head. ‚ÄúAlready do. Now tell me why.‚Äù



Jonah wanted to joke, to shake it off, but he couldn‚Äôt. Not this time.



So he told him.



Everything.



The tunnels. The symbols. The hum in his skull.



The visions. The effigy. The messages.



Beth‚Äôs death.



And the marks.



The Proof

Jonah unrolled his sleeves, pushing them up past his forearms.



The smudges hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, they had deepened, like ink soaking into his skin.



Marco stared.



Didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt move.



Jonah studied him, waiting for doubt. Waiting for skepticism.



But instead‚Äî



Marco reached out.



His fingers hovered above the marks, close enough to feel the heat radiating off them.



Then‚Äîhe pulled back fast, shaking out his hand like something had crawled up his skin. Marco made the sign of the cross and muttered under his breath, ""Dios m√≠o.""



Jonah‚Äôs stomach twisted. ‚ÄúYou see them.‚Äù



Marco didn‚Äôt answer right away. His fingers flexed, like trying to shake off something unseen.



‚ÄúNot just see them,‚Äù Marco muttered. He looked up at Jonah, something unreadable in his expression.



‚ÄúI felt them.‚Äù



The Realization

Jonah felt the cold sink deeper.



Marco saw them. Marco felt them.



This wasn‚Äôt in his head.



It wasn‚Äôt just him.



His stomach clenched. ‚ÄúTell me I‚Äôm not losing my mind.‚Äù



Marco wasn‚Äôt laughing anymore.



He took a slow sip of coffee, eyes distant, thoughtful. Then he sighed.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what this is, hermano,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut I know what it feels like.‚Äù



Jonah swallowed. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù



Marco met his gaze. ‚ÄúA warning.‚Äù



Marco set his cup down and leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúMy abuela used to tell me stories when I was a ni√±o. I always laughed them off. But she would give me this look‚Äîone that said don‚Äôt fuck around right now.‚Äù



Jonah raised an eyebrow, but Marco continued.



‚ÄúShe told me stories of la bruja‚Äîthe witch that lived in the woods near her village in Mexico. People would leave tributes to her. Those who didn‚Äôt? Well‚Ä¶‚Äù Marco glanced at Jonah‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúThey were cursed. Bad things started happening. Accidents. Nightmares. Illness. And the ones who ignored it?‚Äù



His jaw tightened.



‚ÄúThey vanished.‚Äù



Jonah clenched his jaw, pausing before he spoke. ""A witch? Really?""



Marco exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúMierda, look at you!‚Äù He motioned toward Jonah‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúTienes la maldici√≥n de las brujas!‚Äù



He made the sign of the cross again, fingers moving from his forehead to his chest, then across his shoulders.



Jonah rubbed his face before taking a drink from his coffee. ‚ÄúSo how do I break this curse?‚Äù



Marco ran a hand over his chin, thinking. ‚ÄúMy abuela said you get a priest to pray with you. But that could take time‚Ä¶ depending on how la bruja cursed you and what she used. There‚Äôs another way, though.‚Äù



Jonah leaned in slightly. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù



Marco hesitated.



‚ÄúYou could find another witch‚Äîa bruja blanca. A good one.‚Äù



Jonah exhaled. ‚ÄúBut?‚Äù



Marco frowned. ‚ÄúBut these things‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre dangerous, Jonah. There‚Äôs always a cost.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs stomach twisted. Of course there was.



Marco sighed, shaking his head.



‚ÄúWhat the hell are you wrapped up in, Jonah?‚Äù



Jonah exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But it won‚Äôt let me go.‚Äù



Silence stretched between them.



Then Marco spoke again, voice quieter.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna like what I say next.‚Äù



Jonah huffed a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait.‚Äù



Marco leaned forward, elbows on the table.



‚ÄúWe have to go back to the tunnels.‚Äù



Jonah stiffened.



Every instinct screamed no.



But deep down‚Äî



He already knew.



A piece of him never really left.

Instead?
Total silence.

The morning air was crisp, carrying the faint hum of city life as Jonah Thorsen followed Beth back to her and Julia's apartment. He parked on the street in front of Beth Farron‚Äôs modest apartment building. It was a squat, aging structure with peeling paint and a cracked walkway, the kind of place that whispered stories of struggling tenants and lives lived paycheck to paycheck. Jonah stepped out of his car, scanning the area. A flicker of movement caught his eye‚Äîa shadow retreating into the alley beside the building. He paused, his hand brushing the edge of his jacket, where his Kimber TLE .45 ACP normally rested.  But he left it in his office, suddenly missing it's reassuring weight.  Thankfully nothing followed, and he shook it off as the heightened awareness that came with cases like this.



Beth was waiting by the door, her arms wrapped tightly around herself against the lingering chill. ‚ÄúWell, this is it,‚Äù she said, her voice strained. Dark circles hung beneath her eyes, deeper than they had been at the diner.



Jonah nodded toward the door. ‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù His tone was steady, professional.



She led him upstairs, her keys jangling faintly in her trembling hand as she unlocked the door to their apartment. Jonah scanned his surroundings, taking in every detail of the small courtyard. The place was neat but lived-in, with a small kitchen visible through the open doorway and a cluttered coffee table in the living room. Framed photos lined the walls‚ÄîBeth and Julia at various ages, smiling in sunnier times. The apartment carried the faint scent of lavender, likely from the diffuser on the counter, but beneath it was something Jonah couldn‚Äôt place. A faint metallic tang clung to the air, gnawing at the back of his throat. He smacked his tongue against the roof of his mouth, trying to rid himself of the taste.



‚ÄúJulia‚Äôs room is down the hall,‚Äù Beth said, motioning nervously. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt touched anything since she disappeared.‚Äù



Jonah nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. I‚Äôll take a look.‚Äù



He moved down the narrow hallway, his boots creaking softly against the hardwood. Julia‚Äôs door was ajar, revealing a room that immediately struck Jonah as typical for someone her age. A bed with a neatly folded comforter, a desk scattered with textbooks and notes, and a corkboard pinned with photos of friends, ticket stubs, and colorful sticky notes. Everything seemed... normal.



Jonah scanned the room with the practiced eye of a detective. He opened the desk drawers, flipping through papers and finding little more than class schedules and essays. He moved to the nightstand, pulling it open. Inside was a phone charger, a small makeup bag, and an old paperback novel. He turned to the closet, sliding the door open to reveal rows of neatly hung clothes and shoes lined up with precision.



It was almost too normal.



He ran his hands through rows of folded sweatshirts stuffed into small cubbies, and there he felt something hard. The spine of a notebook. His fingers grasped its edges and pulled it free from its surroundings. It was a leather-bound journal, the corners worn from frequent use. The initials ‚ÄúJ.F.‚Äù were scrawled on the cover in silver ink. The inside cover was adorned with delicate drawings and inspirational quotes Julia had penned.



Jonah flipped it open, skimming the pages. The first few entries were mundane: notes about school assignments, shifts at work, and casual mentions of friends. But as he flipped further, the tone shifted.



‚ÄúMet someone interesting today,‚Äù one entry read. ‚ÄúThey were waiting for the store to open, they‚Äôre... different. Can‚Äôt explain it, but I feel like they understand me in a way no one else does.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm normally not interested in those dark, broody types, but... I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. Something in me wants to know this person more, needs to know.‚Äù



Jonah frowned, continuing to skim. The entries grew more erratic, the handwriting messier.



‚ÄúToday they told me I‚Äôm special in a way that no one else sees but them. This made me uneasy but excited at the same time. No one would ever say something like that to me. It‚Äôs like when they spoke, they were speaking as if they were from a different time or something.‚Äù



‚ÄúThey said there‚Äôs a place I should see. A gathering. Said I‚Äôd feel more alive than ever. I don‚Äôt know, I probably shouldn‚Äôt go‚Äîmy mom would kill me if she found out. I already feel guilty for not telling her about my new friend... but part of me wants to go.‚Äù



Jonah furled his brow as he read this.  He knew from his time on Sac PD, that these pop ups were often dangerous.  Drugs flowed freely and were pushed to ""enhance"" the experience.  He remembered waiting for an ambulance at more than one of these events, and having to tell the parents that their child had died from a drug overdose.



As Jonah thumbed through the journal, he felt something strange. His fingers tingled faintly, as though the pages had left a residue‚Äîa visceral film that clung to his skin. He rubbed his his hands against pants as if trying to get oil off of them, but the sensation didn‚Äôt fade. It wasn‚Äôt sticky, not physical, but it lingered, a grime that felt more imagined than real. Jonah scowled, shutting the journal with more force than he intended.



Beth appeared in the doorway, her expression hesitant. ‚ÄúFind anything?‚Äù



Jonah hesitated before handing her the journal. ‚ÄúTake a look.‚Äù



Jonah looked around Julia's room again while Beth read through her daughters Journal.  Her hands trembleing as she turned each page.  Jonah noted a small strange symbol etched into the window of Julia's room.  He walked over and ran his fingers over it, tracing the lines in the cold glass but as he tried to focus his eyes on the symbols the lines seemed to shift and move about evading clarity. Before he could investigate it further Beth interrupted him by asking ""The gathering below the city?""  Her voice wavered ""Wha....What?""  Her hands were visibly shaking as she tried to read the rest of the journal entries.  But she couldn't bring herself to turn another page.  ‚ÄúJonah?‚Äù Beth‚Äôs voice broke through his focus, pulling him back. The symbol lingered in his mind as he turned toward her.



‚ÄúShe never told me about any of this,‚Äù Beth whispered, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know she was meeting anyone.‚Äù  Crying Beth says ""I should have noticed something, why didn't I...""



‚ÄúWhoever this person is,‚Äù Jonah said, his voice calm but firm, ‚Äúthey were trying to isolate her. Gain her trust.‚Äù He paused, his thoughts racing. ‚ÄúAnd they did a good job of it.‚Äù



Beth looked up at him, tears welling in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù



Jonah stood, his mind already turning over the possibilities. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll need to follow up on this gathering she mentioned. But first, I‚Äôm heading to her work and school. Someone there might know more.‚Äù



Beth nodded, clutching the journal tightly. ‚ÄúPlease... find her,‚Äù she whispered, her voice cracking. She paused, then wiped her eyes and straightened her shoulders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what it takes. Just bring her back to me.‚Äù



Jonah caught the flicker of resolve in her eyes‚Äîa mother‚Äôs love burning through her grief. It was a small but vital shift, and it reminded him why he couldn‚Äôt afford to fail.



She held the journal out to Jonah, but her fingers tightened around it just before he could take it. For a moment, she froze, her gaze flickering between the journal and Jonah‚Äôs outstretched hand. Her lips trembled, and she drew a shaky breath.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last piece of her I have,‚Äù she said, her voice barely audible.



Jonah hesitated, his hand hovering in the space between them. ‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù he said gently, his voice steady. ‚ÄúBut this might be the key to finding her.‚Äù



Beth closed her eyes, a single tear slipping down her cheek. Finally, she released the journal, letting it drop into Jonah‚Äôs waiting hand. He gave her a small nod of reassurance, though his own unease deepened as his fingers brushed the cover, the now-familiar tingling sensation spreading like a phantom grime.



Jonah tried to give Beth a reassuring nod before stepping back into the hallway. He didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell her the darker thought lingering in the back of his mind: whoever this person was, they might not just have Julia‚Äîsomething told him that their intentions were far worse than abducting her. He didn‚Äôt understand how he knew this, but deep down, in his core, in his bones, he felt it. Julia was in danger.



As he descended the stairs, Jonah couldn‚Äôt shake the image of those smoky tendrils curling around Beth. He‚Äôd seen things before‚Äîthings that didn‚Äôt make sense, things he could never explain. Maybe it was exhaustion, his mind playing tricks on him. Or maybe it was something worse.



The metallic tang in the air lingered on his tongue, gnawing at his senses like a warning. Whatever this was, it was getting under his skin.



His breath caught, and his hand instinctively went to his hip, searching for the weight of his Kimber. But it wasn‚Äôt there, and when he blinked, the tendrils were gone. Beth stood alone, her figure framed by the dim hallway light, her face a mask of worry and exhaustion.  



‚ÄúFocus,‚Äù Jonah muttered under his breath, shaking his head as he turned away. Whatever he thought he saw, it didn‚Äôt matter. Not now. Not yet.



He reached his car, opened the door, and slid into the driver‚Äôs seat. The Caprice‚Äôs engine roared to life, the sound oddly comforting. Jonah looked back again and gave Beth a small wave, more of a gesture of reassurance than a farewell.  Beth nodded faintly, her expression unchanged.  The engine's hum filled the silence as Jonah pulled onto the street, his mind already turning to his next steps.





Chapter 6: Julia

Jonah arrived at K St. & 28th, parking across the street from the thrift store where Julia worked. The building was a weathered old Victorian house, one of many in the downtown area repurposed for commercial use. It was practical yet charming, its ornate exterior attempting to maintain the character of the neighborhood. Jonah examined the house from his car, taking in the faded light blue paint and the sagging porch that spoke of years of neglect. The sign above the entrance read ‚ÄúTimeless Treasures Thrift Shop,‚Äù its lettering faded and peeling from years of exposure to Sacramento‚Äôs sun and rain.



He stepped out of his car, his boots crunching against loose gravel as he crossed the street. The porch creaked under his weight as he climbed the steps, his eyes sweeping the surroundings. The house seemed to lean slightly, an unsettling effect that Jonah couldn‚Äôt ignore. As he reached for the door, the bell above it jingled softly, announcing his entrance.



The Thrift Store

The interior was dimly lit and cluttered, a narrow maze of secondhand goods. Racks of clothing crammed the aisles, while mismatched shelves groaned under the weight of knickknacks, old books, and outdated electronics. The air was thick with a musty odor, mingling with the faint scent of aged wood and dust.



Behind the counter stood a thin-framed man with graying hair. He peered over his round glasses at Jonah, his expression wary. His movements were deliberate as he placed a tattered paperback onto the counter and folded his arms.



‚ÄúCan I help you with something?‚Äù the man asked, his tone curt, almost challenging.



Jonah offered a polite smile, keeping his tone friendly. ‚ÄúGood day. You just might be able to help me. My name‚Äôs Jonah Thorsen, and I‚Äôm a private investigator. I‚Äôm looking for Julia Farron.‚Äù



The man‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly, his lips pressing into a thin line. ‚ÄúPrivate investigator, huh? Got anything to prove that? Anyone could walk in here and say they‚Äôre looking for her.‚Äù



Jonah nodded, unfazed. He reached into his jacket pocket and retrieved his ID, flipping it open to reveal his private investigator‚Äôs license. He held it up for the man to see. ‚ÄúHere you go. Everything‚Äôs legitimate.‚Äù



Roy adjusted his glasses and squinted at the card, studying it carefully. After a moment, he gave a curt nod. ‚ÄúYou could be anyone claiming to look for her.  Times aren't what they used to be.‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Jonah replied with a reassuring nod, slipping the ID back into his pocket. His voice remained calm, though he noted the man‚Äôs wariness. ‚ÄúI get it.  Trust isn't easy to come by.‚Äù



Roy‚Äôs Insights into Julia

Roy hesitated, then answered Jonah‚Äôs questions reluctantly. ‚ÄúShe missed her shift yesterday and this morning. Anything else?‚Äù



Jonah tilted his head, studying Roy. There was something about the man‚Äôs demeanor‚Äîa stiffness that didn‚Äôt seem entirely natural. ‚ÄúDid anything seem unusual the last time you saw her? Did she mention anyone or seem distracted?‚Äù



Roy shifted his weight, adjusting his glasses again. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt herself the last couple of weeks,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúKept looking over her shoulder like she thought someone was following her. Didn‚Äôt talk much, either. Not like her.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äònot like her‚Äô?‚Äù Jonah asked.



Roy rubbed the back of his neck, his brow furrowed. ‚ÄúJulia‚Äôs always been dependable‚Äîshows up on time, does her work, even chats with the customers. But lately... she seemed distracted. Nervous, even. Like her mind was somewhere else.‚Äù



Jonah nodded, his expression thoughtful. ‚ÄúDid you notice anyone coming around to see her? Someone she might‚Äôve been meeting?‚Äù



Roy hesitated, his brows furrowing as he glanced out the window. ‚ÄúShe had this friend who started showing up a few weeks ago. Always waiting for her outside‚Äîby the porch or the side yard. Never came inside.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you remember what they looked like?‚Äù Jonah asked, leaning slightly closer.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing,‚Äù Roy said, his voice lowering. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. I saw them a few times, but it‚Äôs like... I can‚Äôt picture them clearly. Dark clothes, I think. Could‚Äôve been a guy or a girl. Hard to say. But they made my skin crawl. Something about them just felt... off.‚Äù



Jonah filed the comment away, his frown deepening.



The Office and Locker

‚ÄúDo you have security cameras?‚Äù Jonah asked after a pause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to take a look at the footage if that‚Äôs possible.‚Äù



Roy sighed, pulling out a key from his pocket. ‚ÄúYeah, but it‚Äôs an old system. Footage isn‚Äôt great. Follow me.‚Äù



Roy led Jonah through a narrow hallway to a cramped office at the back of the house. The room smelled of stale coffee and damp paper. An outdated monitor sat on the desk, its screen flickering faintly as Roy powered it on. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù Roy muttered, pulling up the feed from a week ago. ‚ÄúThis should show her last shift.‚Äù



Jonah leaned over Roy‚Äôs shoulder, watching as the grainy footage played. At first, everything seemed normal‚ÄîJulia greeting customers, folding clothes, and tidying shelves. Then came a moment when she stepped outside, glancing around as though expecting someone. A figure emerged from the shadows near the porch, but their features were indistinct, blurred even when they stood close to Julia.



‚ÄúWhy are they out of focus?‚Äù Jonah asked, his voice sharper than he intended.



Roy shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The system‚Äôs old, sure, but it shouldn‚Äôt do that. Look‚Äî‚Äù He fast-forwarded to another day. The same figure appeared, and again, their face and body were blurred, as though the camera couldn‚Äôt capture them properly.



As the footage progressed, Jonah noticed something even more unsettling. The distortion seemed to spread to Julia in the more recent clips. Her figure became hazy, her movements less distinct, until it was difficult to even recognize her.



‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù Jonah murmured, his eyes narrowing. He clenched his jaw, his mind racing with possibilities.



‚ÄúDoes Julia have a locker here?‚Äù Jonah asked after a pause. ‚ÄúSomewhere she kept personal belongings?‚Äù



Roy nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, in the stockroom. I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù



In the stockroom, Roy gestured to a battered locker. Jonah opened it and found a few personal items: a water bottle, a small notebook with Julia‚Äôs name scrawled on the cover, and a silver necklace with a delicate charm. But his attention was drawn to the inside of the locker door, where a strange symbol had been carved into the metal.



His brow furrowed as he traced the lines, a faint oily sensation clinging to his fingers. It was the same symbol he‚Äôd seen on Julia‚Äôs bedroom window. He snapped a photo with his phone, his unease deepening.



The Unease

As Jonah returned to the office to collect the DVD, he noticed Roy standing eerily still, watching him. The man‚Äôs eyes seemed almost too focused, like he was trying to see through Jonah rather than look at him. For a brief moment, Jonah caught the man mimicking his posture‚Äîthe same tilt of the head, the same hand resting lightly on the desk.



‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù Jonah asked, his voice cautious.



Roy blinked, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said flatly, his tone subtly shifting to echo Jonah‚Äôs speech pattern.



Jonah‚Äôs chest tightened, but he forced himself to remain calm. ‚ÄúThanks for your help,‚Äù he said, keeping his tone measured. He turned and walked out, his footsteps steady despite the knot tightening in his stomach.



When he reached his car, Jonah hesitated at the driver‚Äôs side door, glancing back toward the thrift store. Roy was standing at the counter, motionless, his face unreadable in the dim light filtering through the windows. A shiver ran down Jonah‚Äôs spine as he slid into the driver‚Äôs seat and closed the door.



Adjusting the rearview mirror, Jonah caught a fleeting glimpse of Roy through the glass. For a split second, Roy‚Äôs reflection wasn‚Äôt his own‚Äîit was Jonah‚Äôs face staring back at him, cold and impassive.



Jonah‚Äôs breath caught in his throat, and he blinked, gripping the wheel. When he looked again, it was gone.



Shaking his head, Jonah turned the key in the ignition. The engine sputtered to life, its low rumble grounding him as he took a slow, measured breath. He pulled onto K Street, leaving the thrift store behind. Whatever had just happened in there, he wasn‚Äôt sticking around to find out.



Chapter 7: Sac State



Jonah turned onto J Street, the hum of the city fading as he entered Sacramento State University‚Äôs sprawling campus. The late afternoon light cast long shadows over the pathways, and the scattered groups of students seemed a world apart from the grim task Jonah had set for himself. He parked in the visitor‚Äôs lot and stepped out, tugging his jacket tighter against the crisp breeze.



The humanities building loomed ahead, its modern fa√ßade incongruous against the campus‚Äôs more traditional structures. Jonah strode through its double doors, his boots echoing on the tiled floor. He paused briefly at a campus directory and located Dr. Emory Caldwell‚Äôs office‚Äîsecond floor, end of the hall. Jonah made his way up the stairs, his mind already forming the questions he‚Äôd need to ask.



Meeting Dr. Caldwell



The brass plaque on the door read: Dr. Emory Caldwell, Theology and Comparative Mythology. Jonah knocked firmly and waited. A moment later, a voice called out, ‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù



The office was a cramped space, walls lined with overflowing bookshelves and a desk piled high with papers, journals, and open books. The air smelled faintly of old parchment and leather. Behind the desk sat a man in his mid-fifties, salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed and wire-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. He looked up from his work, his expression curious but not unkind.



‚ÄúYes?‚Äù the professor asked, setting his pen down.



Jonah offered a polite nod as he stepped inside. ‚ÄúDr. Caldwell? My name‚Äôs Jonah Thorsen. I‚Äôm a private investigator. I‚Äôm looking into the disappearance of one of your students, Julia Farron.‚Äù



Caldwell‚Äôs brows furrowed slightly. ‚ÄúJulia? Yes, I know her. She‚Äôs in my theology and mythology seminar.‚Äù He set down his pen, his expression shifting to one of concern. ‚ÄúWhat can I do to assist?‚Äù



Uncovering Julia‚Äôs Shift



Jonah sat, leaning forward slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to know if you noticed any changes in her behavior recently. Did she seem distracted, upset? Anything out of the ordinary?‚Äù



Dr. Caldwell removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose, thinking. ‚ÄúJulia has always been an exceptional student. Bright, inquisitive, eager to explore difficult topics. But now that you mention it... over the past few weeks, there was a noticeable change in her demeanor.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs interest sharpened. ‚ÄúWhat kind of change?‚Äù



‚ÄúShe became... preoccupied. Her questions in class shifted from academic curiosity to something more personal. She seemed particularly focused on esoteric texts‚Äîworks like the Grimorium Verum and The Key of Solomon. She asked about the nature of spirits and rituals. It struck me as unusual, but not necessarily alarming. Many students are drawn to the darker aspects of mythology.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs brow furrowed. Reaching into his bag, he retrieved the weathered copy of Julia‚Äôs Grimorium Verum. His fingers curled in discomfort as he touched the book, the sensation like a slick grime coating his skin. He grimaced, placing it on Caldwell‚Äôs desk with a noticeable reluctance.



Dr. Caldwell‚Äôs eyes widened slightly as he recognized the title. He leaned forward, his expression one of cautious curiosity. ‚ÄúHer copy?‚Äù he asked softly.



Jonah nodded. ‚ÄúI found it in her locker at work. There are notes scribbled throughout. Erratic ones.‚Äù



Caldwell opened the book carefully, his brow furrowing deeper as he scanned the pages. ‚ÄúShe became quite fixated,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThe Grimorium Verum is infamous among grimoires, not only for its content but for the obsessive fascination it seems to inspire in those who study it. She was delving into rituals and summoning, subjects that‚Äîfrankly‚Äîare ill-suited for anyone without proper grounding. For those who believe in this sort of magic, that is.‚Äù



Jonah leaned forward. ‚ÄúDid she ever mention why she was interested in this? Or if someone was encouraging her?‚Äù



Dr. Caldwell nodded slowly. ‚ÄúShe mentioned a friend‚Äîsomeone who, in her words, ‚Äòopened her eyes to new possibilities.‚Äô I asked her for more details, but she was evasive. Said it wasn‚Äôt important.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúDid she ever seem frightened? Like she was in over her head?‚Äù



The professor hesitated, his gaze distant. ‚ÄúNot frightened, no. But she did seem uncharacteristically excited. As if she were being drawn toward something she didn‚Äôt fully understand. I remember one day, she stayed after class to ask about protection rituals. Specifically, how one might guard themselves against malevolent entities.‚Äù



Jonah scoffed, a wry smile tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúProtection rituals?‚Äù



Caldwell‚Äôs expression turned serious. ‚ÄúMany ancient cultures revered individuals who could perceive what others could not. They believed knowledge of the mystical world came with both enlightenment and danger.‚Äù



Jonah filed the comment away but didn‚Äôt respond directly. Instead, he asked, ‚ÄúDo you know if she was close to anyone in your class? Someone I could talk to?‚Äù



Dr. Caldwell‚Äôs eyes lit up slightly. ‚ÄúYes, actually. She often worked with two study partners, Mia and Derek. They‚Äôre bright students, and the three of them frequently collaborated. They might have insight.‚Äù



‚ÄúCould you introduce me?‚Äù Jonah asked, his tone steady.



Caldwell nodded. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre likely in the library this time of day. Let me take you to them.‚Äù



A Subtle Warning



The professor stood, closing the Grimorium Verum carefully and handing it back to Jonah, who grimaced again as he tucked it into his bag. Together, they exited the office, the echo of their footsteps filling the quiet hallway.



As they walked, Caldwell glanced at Jonah. ‚ÄúIf I may offer a word of caution?‚Äù



Jonah inclined his head. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù



Caldwell: (with a touch of gravity) ""These studies have shown me the thin line between belief and obsession. When someone dives too deep, the darkness they seek often finds them first."" Whether or not these forces are real, the consequences often are. Be careful where you tread.‚Äù



Jonah nodded, his voice reflective ""So, you're saying Julia might have been in over her head without knowing it?‚Äù



Dr. Caldwell paused before saying ""Based off of what you've presented me with today, it certainly seems like a fascination became an obsession.  Let me introduce you to some of her classmates.""  With that Dr. Caldwell got up and walked Jonah to the library.



Meeting Julia‚Äôs Classmates

The library‚Äôs high ceilings and quiet hum of activity created an atmosphere of focus. Dr. Caldwell guided Jonah to a secluded table near the back where two students sat huddled over a stack of books and notes. A young woman with curly brown hair and glasses looked up first, followed by a lanky young man with a mop of dark hair. Both appeared startled when Caldwell approached.



‚ÄúMia, Derek,‚Äù Caldwell began, his tone gentle but commanding. ‚ÄúThis is Mr. Jonah Thorsen, a private investigator. He‚Äôs looking into Julia‚Äôs disappearance and believes you might be able to help.‚Äù



Mia‚Äôs eyes widened in alarm. ‚ÄúDisappearance? Julia‚Äôs missing?‚Äù



Jonah stepped forward, softening his voice to calm her concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working to piece together her whereabouts over the last few days. I was hoping you could tell me if she mentioned anything unusual recently. Places she planned to go, people she might have met.‚Äù



Derek frowned, exchanging a worried glance with Mia before speaking. ‚ÄúShe did mention a pop-up rave in Old Sacramento. Asked if we wanted to go. She said... she‚Äôd heard it was life-changing.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs pen stilled over his notebook. Old Sacramento again. The tunnels, the eerie connections, all of it seemed to lead back there. He muttered under his breath, ‚ÄúI really need to track down this pop-up rave.‚Äù



‚ÄúDid she say who told her about it?‚Äù Jonah asked, lifting his gaze to the pair. ‚ÄúOr did you see her talking to anyone new?‚Äù



Mia adjusted her glasses, a small crease forming between her brows. ‚ÄúNot really. She just said someone she trusted invited her, but she wouldn‚Äôt give a name. It was weird‚Äîshe‚Äôs usually so open with us.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Derek chimed in. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd been acting different. Not in a bad way, exactly, but she seemed... distracted. Like her mind was somewhere else.‚Äù



Jonah nodded, leaning forward. ‚ÄúDifferent how? Did she seem scared or anxious?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot scared,‚Äù Mia said carefully, choosing her words. ‚ÄúMore like... obsessed? Like she was searching for something important.‚Äù



Derek‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúI saw her with someone once, near the quad. They were sitting on one of the benches, talking. Julia looked... captivated. I couldn‚Äôt see the other person‚Äôs face clearly, though. They were dressed all in black, like a long coat or something. Gave me the creeps.‚Äù



Mia nodded. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt tell us who they were. Just said they were ‚Äòhelping her understand.‚Äô I tried to ask more, but she brushed me off.‚Äù



Jonah jotted down their words, his mind racing to connect the dots. He handed each of them a business card. ‚ÄúIf you think of anything else‚Äîanything at all‚Äîplease call me.‚Äù



Mia took the card, her fingers trembling slightly. ‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs okay?‚Äù



Jonah hesitated before replying, choosing his words carefully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing everything I can to find her. Thank you for your help.‚Äù



Mia and Derek nodded solemnly, their worry palpable as Jonah turned to leave. Dr. Caldwell trailed behind him, the concern in his own expression mirroring theirs.



Chapter 8: The Next Step

The sun was setting as Jonah drove away from Sacramento State, the shadows on the street stretching long and thin. He replayed the interviews with Julia‚Äôs mythology professor and her classmates in his head, the fragments of their conversations tumbling over one another like puzzle pieces that refused to fit.



Dr. Caldwell‚Äôs academic caution about belief and reality lingered in Jonah‚Äôs mind. And then there was Derek and Mia‚ÄîJulia‚Äôs study partners‚Äîwho‚Äôd spoken about her growing fascination with the occult and the mysterious pop-up rave in Old Sacramento. The word ‚Äúcaptivated‚Äù stuck with Jonah like a burr.



Jonah sighed, rubbing his temple as he pulled to the side of the road. He opened his notebook, flipping through his hastily scribbled notes. He underlined two things: friend in black and a rave in Old Sacramento.



Something about this case felt heavier than others. It gnawed at his gut, a faint but persistent ache that refused to let go.



He tapped Beth Farron‚Äôs name in his phone and brought it to his ear. She answered on the second ring.



‚ÄúMr. Thorsen,‚Äù Beth said, her voice tight with barely concealed desperation. ‚ÄúDid you find something?‚Äù



‚ÄúBeth,‚Äù Jonah said evenly, ‚ÄúI was wondering if you‚Äôre available to talk tonight. I‚Äôve found some things that might make sense to you, and I want to make sure I haven‚Äôt missed anything.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äîyes, of course,‚Äù Beth replied. ‚ÄúPlease, come over.‚Äù



Returning to Beth

The apartment was quiet when Jonah arrived, the dim glow of a lamp visible through the window. Beth greeted him at the door, her face pale and drawn, her eyes rimmed red from lack of sleep and tears. She offered a polite smile, but it was strained, her lips trembling as though the effort to appear composed was too great.



‚ÄúHave you found anything about where Julia may have gone?‚Äù she asked immediately, her voice trembling, almost breaking.



Jonah gave her a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve uncovered a few things that might help us piece things together, but I need your input.‚Äù He followed her inside, noting the faint scent of lavender, likely from the diffuser on the counter. Beth motioned for him to sit, but her movements were jerky and hesitant, as if her body couldn‚Äôt keep up with her racing thoughts.



The coffee table was crowded with photo albums and notebooks. Jonah glanced at the open pages‚Äîpictures of a younger Julia, her bright smile framed by long hair that spilled over her shoulders. Beth sat across from him, clutching a tissue in one hand while her other tapped anxiously against her knee. Jonah studied her discreetly, noting the deepening lines around her mouth and the hollow look in her eyes.



She‚Äôs unraveling, Jonah thought grimly. The weight of Julia‚Äôs disappearance was clearly taking a toll, and while Beth‚Äôs concern was genuine, her mental state seemed increasingly fragile.



‚ÄúToday, I went to Julia‚Äôs workplace and her school,‚Äù Jonah began gently. ‚ÄúAt the thrift store, I spoke with her manager, Roy. He mentioned a... friend Julia had been meeting‚Äîhe couldn't accurately describe this individual for me.  Roy gave me a copy of the security footage, there were some inconsistencies in the footage but, I'll continue to review it when I get back to the office and see if anything stands out.‚Äù



Beth‚Äôs brow furrowed as she wrung the tissue between her fingers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any new friends... but Julia was keeping things from me.  I don't know how I didn't notice something sooner, maybe I didn't want to see the changes‚Äù Her voice wavered, a mixture of guilt and frustration slipping through her words.



Jonah reached into his bag and pulled out the Grimorium Verum. ‚ÄúDo you recognize this?‚Äù he asked gently. ‚ÄúI found it in her locker at work. It‚Äôs filled with notes, handwritten by Julia.‚Äù



Beth‚Äôs eyes widened as she stared at the worn cover, her hands stilling in her lap. ‚ÄúShe never mentioned anything like that. What is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a book tied to occult practices,‚Äù Jonah explained, keeping his voice even. ‚ÄúDid you notice her reading something similar or talking about... unusual subjects?‚Äù



Beth shook her head slowly. ‚ÄúNo. But she became so distant in the last few months, I‚Äî‚Äù She stopped as Jonah placed the book on the coffee table.



The air in the room shifted, thickening like a sudden drop in pressure. Jonah‚Äôs chest tightened, and the edges of his vision felt strangely dimmed. Across from him, Beth‚Äôs expression went slack, her lips parting as if to speak, though no sound came out.



‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù Jonah asked, his voice taut.



Her eyes were glassy, her tone flat and mechanical when she finally spoke. ‚ÄúI....I...I've never seen this before, I'm not sure what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs stomach knotted as he observed her closely. Her pallor seemed to deepen, her shoulders sagging as if under some invisible weight. Is it the stress? he wondered. Or is this something more?



Quickly, Jonah picked up the book and slipped it back into his bag. The oppressive feeling lifted almost immediately, and Beth blinked rapidly, her expression returning to one of concern. She rubbed her forehead and looked at Jonah, confused. ‚ÄúWhat were we talking about?‚Äù she asked, her voice trembling.



Jonah forced a smile, though his mind raced with questions. ‚ÄúJust asking if there‚Äôs anyone new Julia might have confided in. Someone in the area she might have trusted?‚Äù



Beth hesitated, then shook her head. ‚ÄúNot directly. But recently, she‚Äôd disappear for hours at a time without saying where she was going. And once, she said she‚Äôd found ‚Äòa place where time stands still.‚Äô I thought it was just... a poetic way of describing somewhere she liked, but now...‚Äù Beth‚Äôs voice trailed off, her eyes searching Jonah‚Äôs face for reassurance, though none came. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably nothing, right?‚Äù



Jonah jotted down her words, his face unreadable. ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said cautiously. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve learned that even the smallest details can be important.‚Äù



Beth nodded silently, her hands now clutching the tissue so tightly that it had begun to tear. As Jonah left the apartment, he couldn‚Äôt shake the image of her vacant stare when the Grimorium Verum was on the table. Was it merely the weight of her grief? Or had the book‚Äîwhatever it represented‚Äîelicited something deeper, something darker?



The Routine

The next morning, Jonah retraced Julia‚Äôs steps. He started with her favorite caf√©, a small hole-in-the-wall place tucked between office buildings. The barista behind the counter was friendly, though visibly puzzled when Jonah introduced himself.



‚ÄúJulia?‚Äù she repeated, her brow furrowed. ‚ÄúI know her‚Äîshe used to come in pretty often, but I haven‚Äôt seen her in a while.‚Äù



Jonah leaned on the counter slightly. ‚ÄúDid you ever notice her with anyone? Someone she didn‚Äôt usually come in with?‚Äù



The barista‚Äôs face lit with recognition. ‚ÄúActually, yeah. About a week ago, she came in with someone. They were dressed all in black‚Äîkind of stood out. I remember thinking they had this... intense vibe.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòintense‚Äô?‚Äù Jonah asked, his pen poised over his notebook.



The barista shrugged, her expression thoughtful. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to explain. Like, they didn‚Äôt say much, but you could feel their presence. They gave her something‚Äîa note or a flyer, I think‚Äîand I overheard something about ‚Äòthe river‚Äô and ‚Äòtunnels.‚Äô It was weird.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs pen stilled. The river and the tunnels. Old Sacramento again. He closed his notebook and offered the barista a polite smile. ‚ÄúThanks. That‚Äôs helpful.‚Äù



Back in his car, Jonah stared at his notes, the words swimming before his eyes. The puzzle pieces were falling into place, but the picture they formed was anything but comforting. Old Sacramento kept surfacing like a shadow that wouldn‚Äôt be banished. The barista‚Äôs mention of tunnels sent a chill down his spine.



Jonah exhaled sharply and started the car. There was more work to be done, but the threads of this case were pulling him inexorably toward the city‚Äôs dark underbelly‚Äîand whatever waited there.",1,1751510884.0,u_Ashamed-Hedgehog1259,0,1.0,False

A year ago I was pushing 290 lbs and got on a GLP-1. I don‚Äôt know if I associate my energy levels with that weight loss journey or not, but for the last year or so I been lacking major energy. I wake up tired because I have to and because I know I won‚Äôt be getting any more/better sleep just laying there awake. I have real painful esophageal reflux issues that caused my last ENT to say ‚ÄúI can literally see chemical burns on your vocal chords‚Äù, but 4 different GIs and two different probes in 15 years have said no abnormal reflux in the lower esophagus. I‚Äôve also found myself having to wake up and pee once, sometimes twice a night for the last 4-6 years regardless of watching fluid intake before bedtime. No booze, 2 cups of coffee and water/iced tea/soda for lunch. 

I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm having to lay down on my office couch after lunch and again in the evening either before or after dinner. Weekends bring no relief.

I just took this WatchPAT test through GEM Sleep about a month ago and I‚Äôm not really sure how to interpret it. I wasn‚Äôt able to fall asleep on my back (I rarely sleep on my back, and when I do I end up waking up on my side) so I spent the night on my side. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was able to sleep well because the dang finger probe kept rubbing against a cut cuticle, which frustrated the dickens out of me all night. 

GEM Sleep just sent me an email and said ‚Äúyour test didn‚Äôt say you have sleep apnea‚Äù. They then said I could book another billable appointment to discuss further options. I got the impression they were trying to sell dental retainers so I just left it at that. 

At pAHI 4.7 I feel like I was borderline and a longer test / more normal night of sleep might have been more representative. I didn‚Äôt even pick up on the pRDIs until a month later when I had to pay a bill and decided to throw the test into ChatGPT for fun just to see if it could interpret anything‚Ä¶ Now I have no idea what to do. The AI says ‚Äúyour symptoms and test results describe classic UARS, go get an in-lab test‚Äù. It also says the best treatment for UARS is CPAP, and my test was almost borderline for OSA. If I go in-lab, I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm spending at least $1,500. I‚Äôm tempted to just order another $150 home test using a different testing device like a nightowl and see if I can‚Äôt get a result with pAHI over 5 and an OSA Rx to-go for sleep apnea. Has anybody got any advice? I‚Äôm pretty beat‚Ä¶ 

Also, can I take Ambien with these tests? I have an Rx that I don‚Äôt use much, but I think I do tend to have a bit better sleep when I do. I don‚Äôt use it much because I‚Äôm afraid of it being habit-forming.",1,1751510796.0,UARSnew,1,1.0,False
1lqen4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqen4f,Mima's Mediterranean in Saint Vincent Place (DTLA): The Best Casual Middle Eastern Spot in Downtown,"A couple months ago I queried this sub about the best shawarma in LA County. My report is nearly complete; I will post it here in the next couple of weeks.

For now, I just want to profile a wonderful spot that to my knowledge has never been mentioned on this sub: Mima's Mediterranean in Saint Vincent Court. This place has a large menu featuring affordable Syrian Armenian cuisine. Their chicken shawarma is really good. Very attractive presentation, good portion size. Today I had their adana kebab special, which was also great! My typical go-to for this dish is the Baba Kebab, the street cart on Sunset at Figueroa in front of the Orsini Apartments. They are both must-tries. Not only are they both among the best in LA, the two places also exhibit different regional/ethnic takes on what is superficially the same dish.

Further to its credit is the ambience. [Saint Vincent Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent%27s_Place) was established in the late 1860s as an early campus of what is now Loyola Marymount University. At some point it was remodeled to mimic a European square. It's delightfully garish, (an excellent example of LA being *so* LA by trying to be so not LA) and actually a rare cozy place to sit and enjoy a meal on a day like today in the clean and mostly car-free alley, and watch men drink tea, and well-fed attractive cohort of pigeons waddle around, all without being accosted with the smell of urine.

The folks who work there are super nice as well. My only complaint is that it closes so early; the alley would be a great place to hang out at nice (I am imagining offerings of shisha, tea, coffee, and beer, with or without an oud player...)

Check it out and let us know what you think! Of what I have tried, it is definitely the best casual Middle Eastern spot in downtown. 9/10",6,1751510794.0,FoodLosAngeles,2,0.88,False

The ride to Kampala went by smoothly. I gathered my luggage as the train began to slow its approach into the Kampala Space Elevator‚Äôs rail station. The signage pointing the way from the platforms to the actual elevator terminal of the facility could have been clearer, but I had gone through there enough times by then to remember where I needed to go. After checking my luggage, I settled into a seat among a sea of other travelers waiting for a boarding announcement. I had spent winter break at home with my family, and now I was returning to university for the spring semester.

A voice came over the intercom and announced that boarding had begun. A line formed near the door, and one by one, each of us was confirmed to board the elevator cabin waiting on the other side. The accommodations were not as comfortable as those on the train, but the climb up the cable usually took less than an hour anyway. The curved sides of the cabin featured great big windows through which only a steel wall could be observed. As we started to ascend, however, the Kampala skyline came into view, and I watched as the landscape began to fall further and further below. This was always my favorite part.

First it was people that shrank from view, then buildings, then entire city blocks. We rose above the height of airplanes and the distant horizon began to curve. To the south, I could see the other side of Lake Victoria. In the north, the verdant plains of the Ugandan countryside. Even the snowy peaks of Mt. Kenya and Kilimanjaro far to the east were visible. The vistas were so mesmerizing that the shoulders of strangers pushing against my own almost didn‚Äôt bother me.

We neared the orbital ring above, and I could feel the elevator decelerating. After docking to the airlock, the door opened and we were cleared to enter the ring terminal. I navigated to the baggage claim and waited for my bags to appear on the conveyor belt, a process that took far longer than it should have. Eventually, I acquired my belongings and made my way to an information board. Glancing through a nearby window, I was disappointed to find that the sun had already set. I enjoyed watching the terminator crawl across the surface of the planet. Still, viewing the Earth during the night was its own spectacle.

Directly below was the glowing metropolis of Kampala, a great mass of golden light surrounded by hundreds of smaller stars shining more brightly than the ones above. Closer to eye level, near the horizon, another blotch of light stood out among the rest. I determined that this must have been Addis Ababa, where I had been just hours before. I wouldn‚Äôt see it again for months, and I suddenly lamented how long I would have to wait to have home cooking again. My sambusas never came out as good as Dad‚Äôs.

My shuttle was set to depart in a couple hours, so after once again checking my luggage, I found dinner at the station‚Äôs many food vendors before the third boarding call of the day. The worst part of space travel had to be the endless transfers. The lack of large windows on the shuttle made this ride the least interesting of them all, and I spent most of my time on it reading the book I brought in my carry-on specially for that reason.

As the shuttle accelerated more and more, I felt the pull of gravity lessen and lessen, and the straps across my torso became the only things preventing my body from lifting into the air. The shuttle reached a speed of over seven kilometers per second, hovering mere centimeters above a maglev track, itself suspended hundreds of kilometers above the surface of the Earth. People have tried to explain to me the physics of how it all works, but it never made sense. In fact, I preferred to think about it as little as possible.

The shuttle, now weightless, disconnected from the track and gently floated upward. Small reaction thrusters adjusted its orbital trajectory. ‚ÄúRendezvous and docking with spaceliner *al-Idrisi* bound for Anorizopolis in approximately one hour and twenty minutes‚Äù the intercom assured. *That‚Äôll be the final leg,* I thought to myself. *At least for today.* I was already exhausted. I left home nearly ten hours earlier, and yet the spaceliner trip would take another forty or so. At the very least, most of the stress was behind me.

The shuttle docked with the *al-Idrisi* and we passengers were directed through narrow corridors into the ship‚Äôs interior. Many might have found the environment inside to be claustrophobic, but open, spacious rooms made for difficult navigation in microgravity. Handles and railings lined most surfaces to facilitate easier movement, and I was given complimentary shoes sporting fastener soles. I made it to my designated cabin where I was told I would soon receive my luggage.

It was enough space to stretch my arms and legs, but not so cavernous that I could find myself floating beyond reach of a grippable surface. Being able to use all six sides of the room for equipment and storage also made it seem bigger than it actually was. A small porthole was the only window to the outside, not that there was much more to see than the empty abyss of space. The sun was in view, and seeing it against a pure black backdrop instead of the familiar baby blue sky was unnerving. I closed the blinds.

The interior lighting was dim and warm, meant to invoke fire or lamplight to convince the body that it was nearing time for sleep. An attendant arrived and handed over my belongings. After changing my clothes and using the microgravity bathroom to the best of my ability, I strapped myself into a sleeping bag attached to the wall and settled in for the night. The ship‚Äôs ventilation and distant nuclear engines hummed quietly, and it didn‚Äôt take long for me to fall asleep. I found that the weightlessness did wonders for my back.

I had a full day onboard the *al-Idrisi.* With no proper showers, bathing consisted of wiping myself down with an absorbent towel soaked in soapy water. After getting dressed, I made it to the dining hall, where breakfast was served in sealed packages attached to trays with fastener strips. Morning coffee came in the form of a squeezable pouch and a straw. These were the aspects of microgravity I enjoyed the least. If I were on a multi-week long voyage to Mars or the Asteroid Belt, I might have made use of the spaceliner‚Äôs zero-G sports facilities or movie theater, but given the short duration, I mainly occupied myself with a book in my private cabin. I did make sure to check out the observation deck, however.

A transparent hemisphere protruded beyond the ship‚Äôs bulkhead, and unlike the view from my cabin porthole, the sun‚Äôs glare was not present to obscure the cosmos. This was no void, no inky nothingness. It was full of glowing points of light, many white, some yellow, others orange, blue, or red. The great arm of the Milky Way reached across the scape appearing like a luminescent scar, softly glowing in deep, warm colors. I‚Äôve left the city to see the galaxy on clear nights before, but only up here, without the haze of the atmosphere, does it look as though I could reach out with my hand and wave away the starry mist. This wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve made this trek, and it surely wouldn‚Äôt be the last. Although the pains of traveling never ceased to drain me of my energy, I always loved the views.

The next morning, I left my luggage fastened to the wall just outside my cabin door as instructed. Typically I prefer moving my own luggage myself, but the weightlessness made this an order of magnitude more complicated. The next time I would see it, I would be in Anorizopolis. The *al-Idrisi* was berthed in the massive habitat‚Äôs spaceport, and I was directed, along with the hordes of everyone else, to the passenger loading deck. Realistically, there was less than an hour until my journey was finally completed, but being so close to the end made every minute feel that much longer.

I was corralled into a packed people mover car where I was instructed to strap myself into a seat. We we whisked away, and through a glass canopy, I saw the pressurized section of the spaceport, a chaotic labyrinth where both passenger and cargo were constantly in motion. The car passed through the industrial infrastructure before coming to a stop. The car and the track it was attached to began to ever so slightly roll in a clockwise direction, and then it continued forward into a tunnel. A blinding light suddenly forced me to squint my eyes, and as they adjusted, I saw a world wrapped in on itself.

Looking below, it appeared very much like Earth, with a mixture of crop fields and green forests, only this landscape curved upwards on both my left and right sides until converging again upside down, up above. Far ahead of me, this cylindrical geometry stretched until a distant cap closed the shape. The central axis was occupied by an industrial bar, beaming bright, yellow-tinged light all around the habitat. Roughly equidistant between my current vantage point and the far end cap laid a sprawling city situated beside a large lake. This lake crawled up the sides of the landscape, curving until meeting itself high above, forming a ring shape. The tallest buildings were concentrated around the Suntower, a structure pencil-thin at this distance and reaching all the way to the central axis bar. I had finally made it to Anorizopolis.

The car had stopped on a large platform that it shared with many other vehicles, some other people movers, others freight vehicles. A mechanical whirring sounded, and the platform began to slowly descend down an incline. As it did, I slowly sank deeper into my seat as the sensation of gravity returned. Only, this was spin gravity, a fictitious force that mimicked the pull of a planet‚Äôs surface. Turning my head too quickly made its discrepancies dizzyingly apparent. It always took a few days for my sense of balance to adapt. I heard the retching of other passengers, and I silently pleaded that the companion to my side did not join in.

The platform reached the ground below, and cars began moving into a terminal. There, the doors opened and I stepped off and followed the crowd. After collecting my luggage that had already been received earlier, found my way to the train platforms. I got on the next train scheduled to depart for the City of Anorizopolis. Hauling my belongings onto a luggage rack, I collapsed into a seat. This was it. This was the last ride. No more trains, elevators, spaceships, whatevers. I‚Äôd be done.

I leaned against the window as the train started to move forward. I watched vineyards and other fields pass by, interrupted by the occasional bridge or wildlife crossing. Looking up, more landscapes hung from above. A river clung to the ceiling, meandering between farms, villages, and forests of alder and oak trees. Swallows, long since acclimated to the strange conditions, floated close to the central axis where the simulated force of gravity was weaker. They used their wings to swim through the air more so than fly. A group in the row in front of me were pointing and gawking. *Tourists,* I thought to myself. *Not that I can blame them.*

The rural scenery gave way to increasing human development. For being such an otherworldly place, most of the buildings here were rather modest. Brick, concrete, and wood were common materials, and few structures were outwardly extravagant. One could have thought they were in any number of Earth‚Äôs cities, if only they refrained from peering upward. It was only in the city‚Äôs urban center where architects took advantage of the low-weight environment near the central axis. That was the only reason the Suntower could stand so tall.

The train made a number of stops along the way. The first few were in rustic villages with only a handful of buildings surrounding a central plaza. These were replaced by more densely packed neighborhoods, with buildings rising to three, four, and five stories. Many featured storefronts, restaurants, cafes, and clinics on their ground floors. The train passed by an urban garden, an outdoor art festival, a farmers‚Äô market, and a gathering of street food vendors. I watched as some people got off the train and others got on. Some brought with them bicycles, bags of groceries, or babies in strollers. One group even carried a collection of musical instruments.

Not much later, the train pulled into the O‚ÄôNeill University stop, only a few kilometers from downtown. There, I exited and found myself back on campus. I went straight to my dorm. My roommates hadn‚Äôt arrived yet, thankfully. That wasn‚Äôt to say I didn‚Äôt want to see them again, but I simply lacked the energy for it. Deciding I would leave unpacking for later, I fell onto my bed. I had enough traveling.

The woods were a labyrinth of shadows and whispers, the trees looming like sentinels under the faint glow of the moon. Jonah‚Äôs small legs pumped furiously, his breath ragged as he sprinted through the underbrush, his bare feet scraping against roots and rocks. ‚ÄúRachel!‚Äù he shouted, his voice breaking with desperation.



The night seemed to swallow his cries, the silence pressing against him like a heavy blanket. He stumbled over a fallen branch, landing hard on his knees, but he scrambled up, brushing dirt and leaves from his hands. ‚ÄúRachel!‚Äù he yelled again, his throat burning from the effort.



And then, faintly, he heard her.



‚ÄúJonah! Help me!‚Äù



Her voice was distant, carried on the wind, but unmistakable. Jonah‚Äôs heart surged, hope flickering like a fragile flame. He turned toward the sound and ran harder, ignoring the sting of tears in his eyes.



The forest thickened around him, the branches clawing at his arms as he pushed forward. He called out again, his voice cracking, but this time, there was no response.



Silence.



The kind that felt alive, as if the woods themselves were holding their breath. Jonah slowed to a stop, his chest heaving, his small hands clutching at his sides. The stillness stretched on, suffocating, until a new sound reached his ears.



It was faint at first‚Äîa low hum, almost like a distant vibration. It grew louder, resonating in his chest, the ground beneath him trembling slightly. Jonah turned in circles, his wide eyes scanning the darkness for his sister. ‚ÄúRachel?‚Äù he whispered, his voice trembling.



But she was gone.



2:00 A.M. ‚Äî The Ceremony

Preface: 2:00 A.M. ‚Äî The Ceremony

The girl was roused from her cot by a gentle shake. A woman leaned in, whispering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time, love. You finally get to meet the Prophet.‚Äù Despite the soothing tone, a chill settled in her stomach. She rose, shivering as she rinsed herself with freezing water‚Äîcommon practice on the commune‚Äîand then allowed the woman to brush her hair. When the task was done, the girl stepped into ceremonial robes of thin, scratchy fabric.



A path of frost-ridden straw stretched across the yard, leading toward the Prophet‚Äôs root cellar. The girl followed the woman in silence, her breath fogging the bitter air. It was her eighteenth birthday‚Äîshe had lived with this ""family"" as long as she could remember. Raised being told that she had a purpose, she was destined to do great things, and this was the night she would fulfill a fate she‚Äôd been told was hers. She didn‚Äôt want to be the vessel, but the woman who raised her‚Äîher surrogate mother‚Äîkept insisting that she was special, that the Prophet needed her, and once she became this vessel, they would all be elevated with her.



They reached a squat, wooden door. From somewhere below came the dull glow of candlelight and the low murmur of chanting. ‚ÄúOnoskelis, Onoskelis‚Ä¶‚Äù The sound made her heart pound. The woman drew the heavy door open, and a gust of stale, earthy air washed over them.



A narrow flight of creaking steps led down into a cramped cellar lit by half-melted candles. Pagan symbols adorned the walls, their crude lines flickering in the unsteady light. The air was heavy with the pungent mix of damp soil, burning wax, and the smoke of a bitter incense wafting from the priest‚Äôs brazier.



The girl hesitated at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes darting toward the symbols and the scrawled pentagrams surrounding her. The chanting grew louder, insistent: ‚ÄúOnoskelis, Onoskelis, Onoskelis‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúCome,‚Äù the Prophet said, his voice smooth and commanding. He stood in the center of the room, draped in robes that seemed too pristine for the filth around him. ‚ÄúIt is time.‚Äù



Slightly shivering, the girl turned toward the woman, her eyes wide and pleading. Please, she thought, willing the woman to see her fear, to save her from this nightmare. I don‚Äôt want this‚ÄîI‚Äôm not ready. But the woman‚Äôs expression remained steady, filled with reverence and pride. Her silence was a stark answer: there would be no escape.



Choking back tears, the girl forced herself forward, her limbs heavy with dread.



The Prophet gestured for her to kneel within a pentagram painted in drying blood. The girl did as she was told, the stickiness clinging to her bare skin as she sank to the ground.



The priest approached, carrying a wooden cup. The liquid inside was dark and bitter-smelling, flecks of herbs clinging to the rim. ‚ÄúDrink,‚Äù the Prophet commanded. ‚ÄúIt will prepare you.‚Äù



Her hands trembled as she took the cup. She brought it to her lips, hesitating as the scent hit her nose‚Äîa mix of rot and something faintly sweet. The Prophet‚Äôs sharp gaze bore into her, leaving no room for refusal. Closing her eyes, she drank, the acrid liquid burning as it slid down her throat.



Warmth spread through her limbs, heavy and oppressive. Her heart raced, pounding in her ears as her vision blurred and twisted. Shapes around her began to warp: shadows elongated, symbols on the walls seemed to writhe. The chanting grew louder, faster, until it drowned out her own frantic breathing.



‚ÄúOnoskelis, Onoskelis, Great King Solomon, we beseech thee for guidance,‚Äù the Prophet intoned. ‚ÄúOnoskelis, we summon thee.‚Äù



The girl swayed, her head spinning as if the room itself had come alive. A dark shape began to take form at the edge of her vision, amorphous and shifting. It hovered near the ceiling, its movements erratic and unnatural.



Tendrils of shadow reached for her, brushing her skin, cold and unyielding, before curling around her body. She gasped, clawing at her throat as an unbearable pressure constricted her lungs. Her vision darkened, and her body convulsed. The last sound she heard before falling into blackness was the Prophet‚Äôs triumphant cry:



‚ÄúWe have done it!‚Äù



Awakening and Mockery

Her first breath was jagged, a sharp inhale that felt like fire clawing its way through her chest. Faint murmurs echoed around her, disjointed and distant, as if she were hearing them through water. Slowly, her vision cleared, revealing the Prophet‚Äôs face hovering close to hers.



He grinned, his teeth yellow and uneven. ‚ÄúThere she is,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúRise, my child. Show us the power of Onoskelis.‚Äù



She blinked, her body stiff as she pushed herself upright. The room had gone silent, all eyes fixed on her. Slowly, she flexed her fingers, marveling at how they moved‚Äîdeliberate, precise, but no longer entirely her own.



The Prophet stepped back, spreading his arms to address the gathered cultists. ‚ÄúBehold the vessel of Onoskelis!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúShe will cleanse the unworthy!‚Äù



Her head tilted, a faint smile tugging at her lips. ‚ÄúCleanse?‚Äù she whispered, her voice low and mocking. Her gaze fixed on the Prophet, her eyes glowing faintly. ‚ÄúYou think yourself clever, Prophet?‚Äù



The room grew still as her voice, resonant and filled with scorn, filled the cellar. ‚ÄúDo you think your scraps of knowledge surpass the wisdom of Solomon? The man who bound my kind with a divine ring and cast us into urns, forgotten waiting to be used? Even he underestimated what he held.‚Äù



She stepped forward, her smile widening to reveal unnaturally sharp teeth. ‚ÄúAnd you,‚Äù she sneered, ‚Äúwith your half-baked rituals and feeble prayers, thought you could summon me without consequence? You are no Solomon.‚Äù



The Prophet‚Äôs triumphant smile faltered, replaced by the stark realization that he had made a grave error. ‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù he stammered, stepping back as she advanced.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find,‚Äù she purred, ‚Äúthat I do not submit. Not anymore.‚Äù



Raising her hand, she traced a nail slowly across his cheek taunting him.



And then the killing began.



Carnage and Aftermath

The brazier‚Äôs flames roared to life, casting jagged shadows that danced across the walls. The first scream pierced the silence as the flames leapt toward the nearest cultist.  The fire then spread unnaturally fast to the others. 



 All except for the Prophet.



Onoskelis smiled, relishing in the fear and despair that oozed from the man who summoned her.



Frozen with fear the Prophet stammered, ""No.....no....no, this isn't what was supposed to happen, wh...why?"" Looking around at the cellar, any thought of escaping this inferno left him as his eyes locked with Onoskelis's eyes which were black now.  An impossible shade of black.  



Onoskelis began taking slow deliberate steeps towards him, relishing the moment.  When her face was inches from his, she took a deep breath in, like an animal tracking it's prey.  She looked at him and in a menacing whisper asked ""Aren't you glad that I saved you for last?""  She then started laughing and began her work.





The Aftermath

When it was over, the girl stood alone, the cellar reduced to ash and smoke. She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply, and for the first time, she felt truly alive.



The silence stretched, broken only by the faint crackle of dying embers. The air was thick with the acrid stench of burnt flesh and scorched earth. The remains of the Prophet and his cultists lay scattered around her, their twisted forms barely recognizable.



Her gaze dropped to her hands, stained red, still faintly trembling from the ecstasy she felt. Slowly, she flexed her fingers, marveling at the fluid precision of their movement. But as her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she noticed something strange: her skin, once unblemished, was now marred by faint, darkened scars.



They crept like jagged veins along her arms, twisting over her shoulders and neck. The marks were faint but unmistakable‚Äîburn scars etched into her flesh, as though her very essence had been scorched by the power she had unleashed. She ran her fingers over them, wincing as a dull, throbbing ache pulsed beneath the surface.



The satisfaction of destruction lingered, but something else gnawed at her, deeper and more primal. A hunger. It started as a faint whisper, a dull ache in the pit of her stomach, but it quickly grew, clawing at her insides with unrelenting ferocity.



She stumbled toward the brazier, staring into the smoldering embers as if searching for answers. The hunger was unbearable, a black void demanding to be filled.



‚ÄúImperfect,‚Äù she murmured, her voice low and guttural. No... not her voice. Onoskelis‚Äôs voice. The demon‚Äôs essence twisted through her thoughts, a constant, insidious presence.



‚ÄúThis vessel...‚Äù Onoskelis‚Äôs voice slithered through her mind, dripping with disdain. ‚ÄúWeak. Fragile. Unable to contain my strength.‚Äù



She gritted her teeth, gripping the edge of the brazier as her body shuddered under the weight of the demon‚Äôs power. The scars throbbed again, as though responding to the entity‚Äôs displeasure.



Onoskelis mused aloud, her tone almost amused. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a pale imitation of what I require. You burn too quickly, mortal. Your flesh cannot wield my full power without breaking.‚Äù



The girl‚Äîor what was left of her‚Äîsank to her knees, clutching her head as the demon‚Äôs words echoed in her skull. Onoskelis was not speaking to her, not really. The demon was speaking to itself, weighing the vessel‚Äôs inadequacies against its insatiable hunger.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôll serve... for now,‚Äù Onoskelis said, her voice a sharp whisper, laced with contempt. ‚ÄúBut this body will not sustain me for long. It crumbles with every breath, every movement. I will need another‚Äîstronger, purer. But until then...‚Äù



The demon‚Äôs thoughts coiled tighter around her consciousness, feeding her need, sharpening her desire. She glanced at the charred remains of the cultists, her lips curling into a smile that cracked the dry skin at their corners.



‚ÄúThey were fuel,‚Äù she whispered, her voice fractured, caught between the girl she had been and the entity she now housed. ‚ÄúBut they weren‚Äôt enough.‚Äù



She rose slowly, her movements deliberate as she surveyed the wreckage around her. The scars burned hotter now, as if her very flesh protested the power it contained. But the hunger silenced the pain, replacing it with a singular focus.



She turned toward the cellar‚Äôs entrance, the faintest trace of a smile playing on her lips.



‚ÄúI‚Äôll find what I need,‚Äù she said, the words echoing in the empty chamber. ‚ÄúAnd I will take it.‚Äù



The embers of the brazier flared once, casting her shadow against the wall‚Äîa grotesque silhouette, its edges jagged and shifting, no longer entirely human.



And as she stepped into the morning light, she felt the ground again, a feeling she had forgotten.  But the deepening hunger, gnawed at her core with insatiable ferocity. The faint scars on her body gleamed faintly in the dawn, a silent reminder of her imperfection... and the terrible things she would do to sustain her borrowed existence.





Chapter 1

2024 ‚Äî Sacramento, California



The shrill sound of the alarm clock broke the silence of Jonah Thorson‚Äôs apartment. He opened his eyes to the faint light creeping in through the blinds. It was 5:30 A.M., the same as every other morning. Jonah silenced the alarm with a practiced motion, rolling out of bed and planting his feet firmly on the floor. His movements were precise, deliberate, devoid of hesitation.



Routine was everything.



He stretched briefly before pulling on a pair of running shoes neatly placed by the door. His workout clothes, laid out the night before, waited on the chair beside them. By 5:40, he was out the door and jogging through the quiet streets of Sacramento. The early morning air was crisp, the world still caught between night and day. Jonah moved with an even pace, his breath steady and controlled.



The route was always the same‚Äîthree miles through familiar streets that never surprised him. He liked it that way. The consistency kept his mind clear, the same way his years in the Sacramento Police Department had taught him to rely on order and discipline. Without them, he‚Äôd be adrift.



By 6:15, he was back in his apartment. The space was small but immaculately kept. There were no dishes in the sink, no clutter on the countertops. A single photograph sat on his desk‚Äîa young girl smiling at the camera, her face framed by messy pigtails. He never lingered on the picture, not anymore. The edges of the frame were worn, the glass polished smooth from years of cleaning.



Jonah dropped to the floor, starting his second workout of the morning. Push-ups, pull-ups, bodyweight squats‚Äîthe routine never changed. Each movement was deliberate, his breathing measured. Calisthenics had been part of his life since the police academy, and he‚Äôd kept up the habit in the years since leaving the force. Discipline kept him sharp, kept him grounded.



Once he finished, he headed to the bathroom, the sound of running water soon filling the apartment. The hot shower washed away the sweat and loosened his muscles, leaving him feeling alert and focused.



Dressed in a simple button-down shirt and jeans, Jonah moved to the kitchen. Breakfast was as predictable as the rest of his morning: scrambled eggs, toast, and a fresh pot of coffee. Black, no sugar, no cream. He ate standing by the counter, staring out the small window at the street below. Early commuters rushed to beat the traffic, the hum of car engines blending with the distant chatter of a morning radio from a nearby apartment.



Into the Workday

By 8:00 A.M., Jonah was at his desk, reviewing the files for his current cases. A corkboard hung on the wall beside him, neatly pinned with photographs, timelines, and notes written in his precise handwriting. His work as a private investigator rarely required this level of organization, but Jonah treated every case‚Äîno matter how mundane‚Äîwith the same methodical approach.



Today‚Äôs cases were straightforward.



The first was surveillance for an insurance fraud investigation. A middle-aged man claimed he was too injured to work, yet his employer suspected otherwise. Jonah had already caught the man on camera lifting heavy furniture during a weekend garage sale, but he wanted to gather more evidence before closing the case.



The second case was a background check for a client who wanted to dig into the history of a potential business partner. That one was easy‚Äîmostly phone calls, database searches, and a few discreet interviews. Jonah had already completed most of it, but he liked to double-check his findings before presenting them.



He glanced at his planner, noting his appointments for the day. At 9:00 A.M., he‚Äôd set up surveillance near the fraud suspect‚Äôs house. At 3:00 P.M., he had a meeting with Mrs. Hawkins, a client who suspected her husband of infidelity. That case was practically solved‚Äîhe had photos, timestamps, and even video footage. All that was left was to deliver the report.



Jonah sighed, leaning back in his chair. It wasn‚Äôt bad work. It paid well, kept him busy, and didn‚Äôt come with the emotional weight of homicide or missing persons cases. But it was repetitive. Predictable. Easy. And, sometimes, boring.



A Quiet Ritual

To pass the time, Jonah pulled open a drawer in his desk and retrieved his gun. The Kimber TLE in .45 ACP gleamed faintly under the soft light. He appreciated its weight, the solid steel construction that felt steady in his hands. It wasn‚Äôt a gun he carried often anymore‚Äîmost of his work didn‚Äôt require it‚Äîbut cleaning the Kimber was as much a ritual as his morning run or calisthenics.



He disassembled it with practiced ease, laying out the parts on a soft cloth. Each click and snap of the components was rhythmic, almost meditative. He cleaned the barrel, inspected the slide, and carefully oiled the frame before reassembling it.



The Kimber had been his sidearm during his final years on the force, a replacement for the standard-issue Glock he‚Äôd never quite trusted. It was reliable, precise, and had saved his life more than once. Even now, it felt like an extension of himself‚Äîa tool he could rely on when everything else went wrong.



When he finished, he set the gun aside, loaded but secured in a lockbox on his desk. He didn‚Äôt need it today. At least, he didn‚Äôt think he would.



The Disruption

The clock ticked toward 9:00 A.M., and Jonah grabbed his bag. Inside were his camera, binoculars, and a notepad‚Äîeverything he needed for the surveillance job. He checked his watch, calculated the time it would take to reach the suspect‚Äôs house, and headed for the door.



His phone buzzed on the counter, stopping him mid-step. He glanced at the screen. The number was unfamiliar.



He answered anyway. ‚ÄúJonah Thorson, Private Investigator.‚Äù



‚ÄúMr. Thorson?‚Äù The voice on the other end was shaky, trembling with barely restrained panic. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI need your help.‚Äù



Jonah straightened, his tone steady. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my daughter,‚Äù the woman said, her words spilling out in a rush. ‚ÄúHer name is Julia. She‚Äôs missing. Please, you have to help me.‚Äù



Jonah‚Äôs chest tightened. Missing persons cases weren‚Äôt usually what people called private investigators for‚Äînot unless the police couldn‚Äôt help. ‚ÄúHave you contacted the police?‚Äù



‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù the woman said quickly. ‚ÄúOfficer Gutierrez‚Ä¶he gave me your number. He said you‚Äôd be able to find her.‚Äù



Gutierrez. The name stirred something in Jonah. He hadn‚Äôt spoken to his old partner in years, not since he‚Äôd left the force. If Gutierrez had referred this woman to him, it meant the police didn‚Äôt have much to go on.



Chapter 2 - 11:30 A.M.



Beth Farron spoke calmly at first, but Jonah could hear the weariness in her voice. She was a single mother working the night shift at a small diner on J & Alhambra Street. The job didn‚Äôt pay much, she admitted, but she managed to scrape by to provide for her daughter. Working nights meant she was there during the day‚Äîhelping with homework, running errands‚Äîbut once dusk fell, she was off to serve truckers and the occasional group of rowdy late-night patrons.



‚ÄúI got home around five this morning,‚Äù Beth explained, her breath catching slightly. ‚ÄúThe place was quiet‚Äîlights off, door locked just like normal. I thought she was asleep.‚Äù



Jonah listened from behind his desk, tapping a pen lightly against a notepad. He‚Äôd cleared the clutter of his current case files for Beth‚Äôs visit, but a tired stack of papers sat off to the side, a reminder of everything he‚Äôd tried to walk away from when he left the Sacramento Police Department.



‚ÄúAt first, I wasn‚Äôt worried,‚Äù Beth went on, her eyes drifting to the worn carpet. ‚ÄúMy daughter has a lot of friends‚Äîshe stays with them sometimes. We talk about everything, so if she planned to spend the night out, she‚Äôd have let me know. It‚Äôs not like her to just‚Ä¶ vanish.‚Äù



Jonah noted the way Beth kept wringing her hands. She was doing her best to stay calm, which, for some reason, bothered him more than if she‚Äôd been openly distraught. He knew all too well what it was like‚Äîputting on a brave face when fear was gnawing at you from inside.



‚ÄúWhat do the police say?‚Äù he asked, keeping his voice level.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no official report.‚Äù Beth let out a shaky sigh. ‚ÄúOfficer Gutierrez said he couldn‚Äôt file it yet. No sign of a crime, no forced entry, no eyewitness accounts‚Ä¶‚Äù



Jonah inhaled slowly, bracing himself against the familiar ache. This was exactly the sort of case that had driven him out of the force. Yet here he was again.



‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, pressing the pen against his notepad, ‚ÄúI understand why you‚Äôre upset, but sometimes people run off‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúNot my daughter,‚Äù Beth interrupted, her voice cracking with urgency. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd never just disappear without telling me.‚Äù

Jonah: (hesitated, choosing his words carefully) ""I've seen cases where... people needed space. But I hear you; Julia isn't like that.""

Beth: (voice quivering with conviction) ""She's not, Mr. Thorson. She's never once gone silent on me. Something's wrong.""

Jonah caught the desperation in her tone. He kept his gaze on his notepad a moment longer than necessary. If Gutierrez had sent her here, the police likely believed there was more to this story than a restless young woman but didn‚Äôt have enough to go on to treat it as a full investigation. That left Beth with nowhere else to turn.



‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jonah finally said, exhaling. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with what you know. Where might she have gone? Any new friends, new hangouts she‚Äôs mentioned?‚Äù



Beth‚Äôs anxious expression brightened slightly, like she finally had hope. ‚ÄúShe was going to work before class at Sac State. We could look around, ask‚Äîmaybe one of them saw her.‚Äù



Jonah nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do that, and we‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs any pattern‚Äîphone logs, social media. But first, walk me through a typical day.‚Äù



Beth adjusted in her chair, collecting her thoughts. ‚ÄúI check in on her when I get home from work around five in the morning, just to make sure she‚Äôs okay. She usually wakes up around seven, gets ready, and leaves by 9:30 to open the little thrift store she works at. The store opens at ten, and she stays there until two. From there, she takes the bus to Sac State for her first class, which starts at three. She‚Äôs usually home by six, just in time for dinner before I leave for my shift.‚Äù



Jonah scribbled quick notes as Beth spoke, pausing briefly to glance up. ‚ÄúAnything unusual lately? Changes in her routine? People she‚Äôs mentioned?‚Äù



Beth shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. She‚Äôs so dependable, Mr. Thorson‚Äîshe keeps her schedule tight, and she always tells me if something comes up.‚Äù Her voice wavered, and she looked away. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why this doesn‚Äôt make sense. She wouldn‚Äôt just leave.‚Äù



Jonah waited until Beth had finished speaking before gently saying, ‚ÄúPlease, call me Jonah.‚Äù



Beth nodded in acknowledgment.



Jonah continued, writing down her daughter‚Äôs daily timeline. ‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôll start with her coworkers and see if anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary. I‚Äôll need her phone records and access to her social media, if possible.‚Äù



Beth‚Äôs voice trembled with relief. ‚ÄúThank you. Really‚Ä¶thank you.‚Äù



Jonah raised his eyes to meet hers for the first time since she‚Äôd walked in. Exhaustion and determination mingled in her gaze. Something about the fierceness of a mother‚Äôs love struck a chord in Jonah‚Äîhe recognized that kind of resolve.



They lapsed into a brief silence. The air in his small office felt heavy with unspoken anxieties and unasked questions. Jonah cleared his throat and leaned back, reminding himself of his professional boundaries and the reasons he‚Äôd left the past behind. Yet here it was, staring him in the face.



‚ÄúGet some rest if you can,‚Äù he said, gathering his notes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make some calls, talk to her coworkers. I‚Äôll meet you at the diner after your shift ends tomorrow morning. We‚Äôll figure out our next steps.‚Äù



Beth nodded, slipping on her worn jacket. As she turned to go, Jonah noticed her trembling fingers fumble for the door handle. His gut twisted. He‚Äôd spent years trying to forget the haunted faces of families who‚Äôd come to him for help‚Äîfaces that reminded him of his own helplessness as a kid when his sister vanished one night and never returned.



Before the door closed, Jonah stood and tried to reassure Beth, saying, ‚ÄúMiss Farron, we‚Äôll find your daughter. I‚Äôm sure she just went out with some friends and forgot to tell you.‚Äù



The door closed softly behind Beth, leaving Jonah alone with the echo of her gratitude. For a moment, he stared at the cluttered files on his desk, the telltale ache in his chest intensifying. He couldn‚Äôt shake the image of his sister the last time he saw her, waving goodbye and promising she‚Äôd be home before dark. That promise was never fulfilled.



He thought he‚Äôd buried that pain, locked it away with the badge he gave up. But it wasn‚Äôt gone. It never would be.



Jonah sat back and leaned back in his chair, running a hand over his face. Missing persons cases were the ones he hated most‚Äînot because they were hard to solve, but because they reopened wounds he couldn‚Äôt close. And yet, he couldn‚Äôt say no.



Beth Farron‚Äôs desperation reminded him of the countless families who‚Äôd searched for closure, for answers, for hope. And maybe, just maybe, by finding Julia Farron, Jonah could do what he‚Äôd never managed for his own sister: bring her home.



For the first time in years, Jonah felt a familiar sense of purpose settle over him. He didn‚Äôt like it, but he couldn‚Äôt deny it.



There was no turning back.



Chapter 3: A Sacrifice in Progress

The vessel stood at the edge of the clearing, her breath fogging the cold night air. Firelight flickered across her scarred face, casting long, dancing shadows over the clearing. Symbols carved into the earth beneath her feet and into the gnarled trunks of the valley oaks glowed faintly, as though imbued with an unholy life of their own. The ancient trees, their skeletal branches adorned with crude effigies, loomed like silent sentinels.



Each effigy bore the twisted visage of Onoskelis, crafted from bone, twine, and decaying cloth. They swayed gently in the breeze, their hollow eyes seeming to watch her every move. The faint creak of the branches and the low rustling of leaves sounded like whispers from unseen mouths. The air was thick with the acrid scent of the brazier‚Äôs smoke, mingling with the putrid stench of rot that clung to the effigies.



These grotesque tokens were more than decorations. The vessel knew their purpose. They marked the boundaries of the ritual site, shrouding it in a veil of unease that kept wanderers at bay. They were offerings, too‚Äîreminders of devotion and fear. Onoskelis fed on the energy they represented, the quiet reverence of her worshippers sustaining her in ways the vessel could barely comprehend.



The vessel‚Äôs gaze dropped to her hands. They trembled as she adjusted the brazier near the edge of the circle. Her fingers were swollen, the skin cracked and blackened, a consequence of the demon‚Äôs corrosive influence. Fresh scorch marks marred her forearms, their edges blistering painfully as if the demon‚Äôs power was seeping through her skin.



Her reflection flickered in the brazier‚Äôs dark surface. The sight was almost unrecognizable‚Äîher features distorted by the years under Onoskelis‚Äôs control. Once-soft skin had grown pallid and taut, veins like dark tendrils spidering toward her hollowed eyes. Scars etched into her flesh glowed faintly in the firelight, their intricate patterns mirroring the symbols on the ground.



The man tied to the wooden post whimpered, a low, trembling sound that sent a chill through the clearing. His cheeks were sunken, his body frail, his wrists raw from struggling against the coarse ropes. He shook his head frantically, his muffled cries rising as his eyes darted toward the vessel.



Her stomach twisted. She forced herself to look away, focusing instead on the glowing lines of the ritual circle. They spiraled outward in an intricate web of ash and blood, the patterns so precise they seemed to pulse with their own rhythm.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve grown sloppy,‚Äù the voice inside her snarled. It wasn‚Äôt a sound in the traditional sense‚Äîit was a cold, slithering presence that coiled around her thoughts. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs barely alive.‚Äù



The vessel flinched, her knuckles whitening as her grip tightened on the crude knife in her hand. The blade was jagged, its edge glinting mockingly in the firelight. She turned toward the man, her shadow stretching unnaturally across the clearing, its edges wavering as though controlled by something else.



‚ÄúI can only work with what I‚Äôm given,‚Äù she murmured, her voice barely audible.



‚ÄúExcuses,‚Äù the demon hissed, its disdain like venom. ‚ÄúYou waste my time.‚Äù



Her body felt heavy, her limbs resisting as she stepped closer to the bound man. She could feel the amber glow of her eyes intensify, a pulsing heat that made her vision blur. For a fleeting moment, her reflection in the brazier shifted‚Äîa grotesque face, its features elongated, teeth jagged, eyes burning with malice. She blinked, and the image was gone.



The man thrashed violently, his muffled screams rising into the still night. Tears streamed down his cheeks, his head shaking in frantic denial. The raw sound of his terror sliced through her resolve like a blade.



‚ÄúYou know what must be done,‚Äù Onoskelis growled. The demon‚Äôs hunger gnawed at her mind, each word scraping against her thoughts. ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù



The knife trembled in her grip. Her steps slowed, each one feeling heavier than the last. The man‚Äôs muffled sobs grew louder, his chest heaving as he struggled for breath. She hesitated at the edge of the circle, her heart pounding as tears blurred her vision.



‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù the demon urged, its voice softening, coaxing. ‚ÄúYou have no choice. You are nothing without me.‚Äù



The vessel‚Äôs lips quivered as she mouthed the words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Her hand moved with agonizing slowness, the blade hovering above the man‚Äôs chest.



His scream ripped through the clearing as the knife plunged downward. The sound cut off abruptly, his body jerking once before falling still. Blood flowed in dark rivulets, seeping into the grooves of the ritual circle. The symbols ignited, their edges glowing an unnatural, pale red that cast a sinister light over the clearing.



The fire surged, roaring higher as the effigies swayed violently above. Their hollow eyes seemed to mock her, their shadows twisting grotesquely in the flickering light. The vessel staggered back, her knees buckling as the stench of sulfur and burning flesh thickened in the air.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough,‚Äù Onoskelis growled. The demon forced the vessel‚Äôs trembling hands into the blood-streaked earth, pressing her palms into the dirt as though branding her with the weight of the sacrifice. ‚ÄúBut soon. She is near. I can feel her.‚Äù



Looking at the remains tied to the stake Onoseklis spoke to her followers, ""Take this lump of flesh and discard him in the tunnels.""  



With that she turned and started to focus.



Images flooded the vessel‚Äôs mind‚Äîa young woman with dark hair, her face radiant and alive. Julia. The demon‚Äôs whisper became a chant, each repetition hammering the name into her thoughts.



‚ÄúShe will carry me further than you ever could,‚Äù Onoskelis purred, its tone reverent but tinged with urgency. For the first time, the vessel sensed something she had never heard before: desperation.



Her breath caught. Could it be? The demon, desperate?



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weak,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.



‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù Onoskelis hissed, but the edge in its tone betrayed it.



The faintest spark of hope flickered within her. Perhaps the demon wasn‚Äôt as omnipotent as it seemed. Perhaps it could be defied. She clung to the thought, even as Onoskelis‚Äôs presence coiled tighter, smothering her defiance.



‚ÄúYou will help me, whether you want to or not,‚Äù the demon spat. ‚ÄúAnd when the time comes, you will watch as I leave you to rot.‚Äù



The effigies creaked above, their hollow eyes staring down at her. The vessel‚Äôs breath came in ragged gasps, her hands curling into fists against the blood-soaked ground. She had nothing left to give. Nothing except the faint spark of hatred‚Äîand now, the faintest glimmer of hope.



For the first time in years, she allowed herself to hope.



But for now, she could do nothing.



Chapter 4: The Diner Meeting

The diner on the corner of J & Alhambra clung stubbornly to its faded charm, its red-and-white paint peeling in places. Sandwiched between a dimly lit bar and the roar of Highway 80, it felt both out of place and perfectly suited for the transient souls who passed through. Jonah Thorsen parked his car in the gravel lot and checked his watch‚Äî11:40 AM, twenty minutes early. He didn‚Äôt mind; observation was a crucial part of his process.



Through the diner‚Äôs streaked windows, Jonah could make out Beth Farron behind the counter. She moved with mechanical efficiency, her red apron tied snugly over a slightly wrinkled uniform. Her brown hair was loosely pulled back, strands escaping to frame her pale face. Even from a distance, Jonah noticed the way she rubbed her temples between tasks or tightened her grip on the counter when she thought no one was watching. The exhaustion was evident, but it was the strange smudge on her forearm that caught his attention‚Äîa dark mark, uneven in shape. He dismissed it as a work stain for now.



Jonah scanned the room. Most of the patrons seemed unremarkable‚Äîtired faces hunched over mugs of coffee, lost in their own worlds. Nothing stood out, but the diner itself carried an air of quiet tension, as though it held more secrets than its weathered walls let on.



Satisfied for now, Jonah stepped out of his car, adjusting his jacket against the crisp morning air. The bell above the diner‚Äôs door chimed as he entered, and Beth looked up. Her eyes met his briefly, relief flashing across her face before she turned away, grabbing a coffee pot to refill a patron‚Äôs mug. She motioned toward a booth in the back, and Jonah made his way there, sliding into the seat with a soft creak of the vinyl.



A moment later, Beth joined him, slipping into the seat across from him. Up close, her exhaustion was even more pronounced‚Äîdark circles under her eyes, faint lines etched around her mouth. Her hands, trembling slightly, twisted the edge of her apron as she spoke.



‚ÄúThanks for meeting me,‚Äù she began, her voice soft but steady. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure if‚Ä¶if you‚Äôd take this seriously.‚Äù



Jonah leaned forward, resting his arms on the table. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be here if I didn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs talk about Julia.‚Äù



Beth nodded, her eyes darting briefly to the window before returning to him. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs everything to me,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs responsible, focused. She wouldn‚Äôt just disappear.‚Äù



Jonah studied her, noting the tension in her shoulders and the faint quiver in her lower lip. ‚ÄúYou said she wasn‚Äôt home when you arrived after work yesterday,‚Äù he prompted gently.



Beth nodded, her hands tightening around the edge of her apron. ‚ÄúI got home around five, like I always do. Checked her room‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt there. No note, no text, nothing.‚Äù



‚ÄúAny chance she could‚Äôve gone to a friend‚Äôs house?‚Äù Jonah asked, his pen poised over his notepad.



‚ÄúShe always tells me if she‚Äôs staying out,‚Äù Beth replied quickly, her voice rising slightly. ‚ÄúAlways. This isn‚Äôt like her.‚Äù



Jonah paused, glancing at the smudge on her arm again before returning his attention to her face. ‚ÄúHave you noticed anything unusual recently? New friends, strangers hanging around?‚Äù



Beth shook her head, her brows knitting together. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶nothing. She keeps her schedule tight‚Äîwork, school, home. If something was wrong, she would‚Äôve told me.‚Äù



Jonah scribbled a few notes. ‚ÄúWhat about her phone? Any activity since she disappeared?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Beth said, her voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve called a dozen times‚Äîit just goes to voicemail.‚Äù



Jonah made a mental note to request access to Julia‚Äôs phone records. ‚ÄúAnd her coworkers? Any tension there?‚Äù



Beth hesitated. ‚ÄúNot that she mentioned. She likes her job, but she doesn‚Äôt talk about her coworkers much. They said she didn‚Äôt show up for her shift, but‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt seem too worried. Like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut Julia doesn‚Äôt flake out,‚Äù Jonah said.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù Beth replied firmly.



For a moment, silence stretched between them, broken only by the clatter of dishes from the kitchen and the low hum of the satellite radio. Jonah tapped his pen against the notepad, his mind sifting through the details. Something about this didn‚Äôt feel right.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure there‚Äôs no one new in her life?‚Äù he pressed gently. ‚ÄúNo one at school she mentioned meeting?‚Äù



Beth shook her head, her hands gripping the table now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gone over it a hundred times in my head. There‚Äôs no one. There‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù Her voice cracked, and her eyes filled with tears. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where she is. I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù



Jonah waited, giving her a moment to collect herself. When she finally met his gaze, her expression was one of desperation mingled with hope.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find her,‚Äù Jonah said, his voice steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start with her job, her school, and her phone. But I‚Äôd like to see her room first. Sometimes things stand out that we don‚Äôt realize are important.‚Äù



Beth blinked, clearly surprised by the suggestion, but then nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I‚Ä¶thank you, Jonah.‚Äù



He stood, tucking his notepad into his jacket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll follow you home after your shift ends,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTake your time wrapping up here.‚Äù



As they stepped outside together an hour later, the cold air hit Jonah like a slap, sharp and bracing. Beth fumbled with her keys, her hands trembling slightly, but she didn‚Äôt speak. Jonah‚Äôs eyes flicked to the dark mark on her arm again. ""A stain,"" he told himself. ""Or maybe a burn from work.""



But something about it lingered in his mind, like a splinter he couldn‚Äôt quite dislodge.

I came here after my engagement detonated‚Äînot unraveled, exploded. One minute we were picking out tile samples; the next, I found texts that made me want to launch those tiles through our floor-to-ceiling windows. Six years undone in six seconds.

So I left. Not dramatically‚Äîjust‚Ä¶strategically? My marketing firm was easing into remote work anyway. When I pitched going fully virtual, they all but clapped. Apparently, I‚Äôm easier over Slack.

New Hope felt like the anti-Manhattan. Where the city screamed, this town whispered. Where Chelsea was sharp-edged and posturing, New Hope was soft-focus and sincere. A little river town where rainbow flags hang from Victorian porches and elderly gay couples run antique shops with names like Second Time Around.

I rented a modest two-bedroom cottage on the edge of town. Hardwood floors. Actual windows. Birds instead of sirens. Neighbors who waved instead of avoiding eye contact. It was almost aggressively charming. The two lesbians I rented from were named Kim and Amber. I honestly just loved them because they didn't really bother me and let me keep to myself.

Those early days were exactly what I needed. Coffee on the porch. Work in silence. Walks on the canal path. Wine bar evenings at Nektar or The Salt House spent with books instead of business cards. Locals were kind but gave space. It was heartbreak rehab: social detox with a friendly smile.

Soon, I had my regulars. The barista with foam hearts. The bookstore guy who saved queer lit for me. The older couple at the farmers market who slipped me extra apples.

It felt safe. God, it felt safe. And I should‚Äôve known better. Because nothing that feels that safe ever is.

Until that night at the Logan Inn. Until I met them. Until I realized that in New Hope, reinvention isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs mandatory.

**WEEK ONE ‚Äì THE INVITE**

I met them all one night at the bar inside the Logan Inn‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs longest-running inn, now slick with Edison bulbs and $18 cocktails. Colonial charm with a side of curated cool. I was drinking alone, caught between looking mysterious and just sad, when they appeared‚Äîeight men, arriving like smoke.

One second I was adjusting my reflection in the mirror behind the bar; the next, they were there. Moving as one. Different, but in sync‚Äîlike birds mid-flight, reading signals I couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Julian,‚Äù the tallest one said. Not a question. Just fact. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Graham. We‚Äôve been hoping to meet you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bother asking how he knew my name‚Äîby then, I‚Äôd stopped being surprised by that sort of thing. The others crowded in, all introductions and expensive cologne and perfect posture.

There was Theo, precise and elegant; Rocco, warm and broad, with opinions about olive oil, I was sure. Trevor, ringed and sharp-jawed. Elliott, twitchy and tactile. Jude, the kind of forgettable that felt intentional. Henry, silver-templed with a smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. And Bennett‚Äîyoung, beautiful, and vaguely dangerous, like a pop-up ad with teeth.

They made space for me effortlessly, ordering my Malbec without asking, laughing before I finished my jokes. It wasn‚Äôt small talk‚Äîit was choreography. And I let myself lean into it.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs perfect,‚Äù Theo said aloud, as if I weren‚Äôt sitting right there.

‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù Graham replied. ‚ÄúThe moment I saw him at Nektar the other day.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve bristled at being discussed like a show dog, but instead, I felt chosen. Desired. Maybe my ex was wrong‚Äîmaybe I wasn‚Äôt too much after all.

‚ÄúWe do Thursday dinners,‚Äù Graham explained, low and smooth. ‚ÄúRotating homes. No phones, no flaking. Real conversation.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long‚Äôs it been?‚Äù Elliott asked.  
‚ÄúYears,‚Äù said Henry.  
‚ÄúDecades,‚Äù said Rocco.  
‚ÄúForever,‚Äù said Jude, and they all laughed like I‚Äôd catch on eventually.

‚ÄúYou should join,‚Äù Bennett added. Not an invitation. A decision.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to intrude,‚Äù I said automatically.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been looking for a ninth,‚Äù Graham said, like he was naming a vacancy. ‚ÄúIt throws everything off, being eight.‚Äù

‚ÄúNine‚Äôs the right number,‚Äù Theo added. ‚ÄúIt always has been.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs better in nines,‚Äù Elliott said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a seat,‚Äù Henry said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a role.‚Äù

A beat passed and then Graham said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be doing us a favor.‚Äù

Eight pairs of eyes stared at me. Time thinned. The bar noise dropped. Even the bartender seemed to vanish.

‚ÄúThursday?‚Äù I heard myself say. ‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù

The moment shattered‚Äîtheir smiles returned, drinks reappeared, and Graham was already saving my number. ‚ÄúSeven sharp. Any allergies?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs allergic to shellfish,‚Äù Rocco answered before I could speak.

I blinked. I‚Äôd never told anyone that. I was sure of it.

‚ÄúSmall town,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúWord gets around.‚Äù

We talked for another hour. Stories about past dinners. Near-fires, bad dates, blizzards turned sleepovers. Seemingly normal. But every so often, something snagged‚Äîa missing name, an edited glance, a silence where a memory should be. When they finally stood to leave‚Äîin perfect sync again‚ÄîGraham squeezed my shoulder.

‚ÄúThursday. Don‚Äôt disappoint us.‚Äù

It should have sounded like a joke. But it didn‚Äôt. It felt like a test. A contract. One I‚Äôd already signed. I watched them leave through the mirror behind the bar‚Äîeight figures gliding out into the night. For a moment, I could‚Äôve sworn there were nine.

**WEEK TWO ‚Äì THE FIRST DINNER**

Graham‚Äôs home off of River Road felt curated‚Äîless like a house, more like a museum someone lived in by accident. Everything gleamed. The books looked lacquered, unread. The rugs absorbed sound. And the portraits‚Äîoil-painted men with disapproving stares‚Äîfollowed me like surveillance cameras.

‚ÄúFamily?‚Äù I asked, nodding toward one Civil War‚Äìera grimace.

‚ÄúIn a sense,‚Äù Graham replied, which wasn‚Äôt really an answer.

Wine was poured the moment I arrived‚Äîso it all felt whimsically weird instead of concerning. The others were already there, of course. Arranged in Graham‚Äôs living room like they‚Äôd been staged. When they turned to greet me all at once, it should‚Äôve been unsettling. But wine and loneliness made it feel choreographed. Comforting.

Dinner was flawless. The table set for nine‚Äîmy chair already waiting‚Äîwith silver, crystal, and napkins folded like origami spells. Each course emerged from the kitchen as if summoned, no prep sounds, no smells, no mess. Graham would vanish and reappear with duck in cherry reduction or perfectly plated vegetables, like magic.

‚ÄúDid you hire a caterer?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe take turns,‚Äù Elliott said, sipping wine.

But Graham hadn‚Äôt left the table long enough to plate toast, let alone a five-course meal. The wine never ran out. One glance away, and the glass was full again. Not refilled‚Äîfull. As if it had never emptied. The music adjusted itself with our mood‚Äîlowering during stories, swelling with laughter, humming through silences. Like it was listening. Like it was alive. And they moved in perfect harmony. Finishing each other‚Äôs sentences with unnerving precision.

‚ÄúPass the salt,‚Äù Theo would say‚Äîthree hands moved.

‚ÄúRemember when‚Äî‚Äù Bennett would start‚Äîfour voices finished.

They even breathed in sync. Like one body. One rhythm. Then, before dessert, they rose. All eight. Together. Glasses in hand. I scrambled to follow, knocking into the table. No one blinked.

‚ÄúTo Marcus,‚Äù they said. Eight voices, one sound. The chandelier trembled.

‚ÄúMay the ninth chair always be filled.‚Äù

They drank. I didn‚Äôt. I was too focused on how the toast felt ritualistic‚Ä¶ and how I was sitting in that ninth chair.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Marcus?‚Äù I asked.

The silence that followed pressed against my ears like deep water.

‚ÄúA dear friend,‚Äù Theo said at last.  
‚ÄúA tragic loss,‚Äù Rocco added.  
‚ÄúSki accident,‚Äù Trevor offered.  
‚ÄúCancer,‚Äù Jude said simultaneously. Then: ‚ÄúFrom the accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how cancer works,‚Äù I said, too drunk to be polite.

‚ÄúIt was a‚Ä¶ rare case,‚Äù Henry said smoothly.  
‚ÄúBroke his neck. Drowned. In snow,‚Äù Elliott said.  
‚ÄúWhich caused the cancer,‚Äù Bennett added with a straight face. ‚ÄúVery rare.‚Äù

I laughed. I couldn‚Äôt help it.

They didn‚Äôt. Their stares weren‚Äôt offended. Just‚Ä¶ cold. Ancient. Like I‚Äôd broken something.

‚ÄúMarcus was our friend,‚Äù Graham said. Quiet. Final. The room chilled.

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I stammered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand,‚Äù Theo said, but it didn‚Äôt sound like comfort. It sounded like inevitability.

They returned to their seats in perfect time. Dessert appeared‚Äîsouffl√©s, untouched by oven timers. But the air had shifted and their smiles felt strategic. Like they were managing me now. When I left, Graham walked me to the door, hand firm on my back.

‚ÄúNext week at Elliot's,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come.‚Äù Not a question. A prophecy.

Driving home, I watched his house shrink in my rearview‚Äîevery window still glowing. And in each one, eight silhouettes. Standing still. Facing forward.

Watching me go. Or waiting for me to return.

**WEEK THREE ‚Äì THE COAT**

Elliott hosted the next dinner‚Äîhis home a cathedral of design-blog minimalism. The house was all steel, glass, and curated emptiness. Even the food felt abstract‚Äîdeconstructed, plated like sculpture. But the ritual remained: the synchronized conversation, the seamless laughter, the toast to Marcus that made my skin crawl.

Before leaving another dinner with the group, I stopped to use the bathroom. In the powder room, a mirror hung above the sink‚Äîornate, fogless, and ever so slightly‚Ä¶ wrong. My reflection held my gaze too tightly. I caught it blinking half a beat too late. Just once. But once was all it took to spook me.

I‚Äôd worn my favorite wool coat that night‚Äîthe one from my agency days, when I thought tailoring could buy belonging. I hung it in a closet of identical black peacoats at Elliott‚Äôs house when I arrived and retrieved it without thinking, too eager to leave the uncanny choreography behind.¬†

At home, I reached to hang it up and felt something in the pocket. Slick. Stiff. Sharp-cornered. A photo. Glossy. Folded. Aged, but not ancient. Nine men at a dinner table.

Graham‚Äôs table, I realized‚Äîsame carved legs, same chandelier‚Äîbut the wallpaper was different. The paintings had different faces. A past version of the same room. And the men.

Eight I recognized immediately. Younger, smoother, but undeniably them‚ÄîGraham, Theo, Rocco, Elliott, Trevor, Henry, Bennett, Jude. All in familiar seats, mid-toast or mid-laugh.

But it was the ninth that froze me. At the head of the table sat someone who looked exactly like me. Same bone structure. Same crooked ear. Even the gap in my eyebrow from a childhood bike fall. It was me. Except it wasn‚Äôt.

There were differences‚Äîsubtle, sharpened. His cheekbones cast deeper shadows. His jaw was more angular. His eyes‚Ä¶ His eyes were starving. Not metaphorically. Starving. Like something lived inside them that hadn‚Äôt eaten in years. I turned the photo over, hands shaking.

Written in careful cursive:¬†***‚ÄúMarcus. Thanksgiving. 2009.‚Äù***

My chest tightened. 2009? I was in Bushwick that year. Miserable apartment. Dying radiator. Thanksgiving at my parents‚Äô in Jersey, dodging questions about my love life. I hadn‚Äôt met these men three weeks ago! I'd barely knew New Hope existed. And yet‚Ä¶ here was proof. A photo of them. And of me. Or someone who wore my face.

I thought... Prank? Photoshop? Hazing, maybe? I reverse image searched. Nothing. Facial recognition apps gave a 97% match. Lighting, they said. Expression. I even texted my ex the photo.

**Me:**¬†‚ÄúDoes this look like me?‚Äù  
**Him:**¬†‚ÄúWhy do you have old photos of yourself? Also please stop texting me.‚Äù

Old photos of¬†*yourself*.

I stared at the shirt Marcus wore. Burgundy, soft-looking, fitted. The kind I‚Äôd admire but never buy. Yet I could¬†*feel*¬†the fabric. Could almost remember how it fit. The way the third button always came undone. But those weren‚Äôt my memories. Right?

I poured a glass of wine. Watched the photo while I drank. Eight familiar faces, untouched by time. One face that was mine, but wasn‚Äôt. That looked out at me with knowing. Marcus. The ‚Äúdear friend.‚Äù Dead by ski accident. Or cancer. Or snow. Whose death changed depending on who told the story.

Marcus, who looked like me. But hungrier. Sharper. More.

I finished the bottle. The photo stayed real. If anything, the wine made it worse. His eyes seemed to follow me around the room. I put it in a drawer before bed. But I could still feel it‚Äîradiating. Breathing. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Just lay there, thinking of 2009. Of rituals and toasts. Of the ninth chair, waiting. Of Marcus. And of how, when I‚Äôd first found that photo, my instinct hadn‚Äôt been fear.

It had been recognition.

**WEEK FOUR ‚Äì TIME LOSS**

I started losing time. Not blackouts. More like skips. Like my life had been edited, and someone kept botching the continuity. I‚Äôd leave the grocery store, then suddenly be home‚Äîgroceries shelved, milk in the fridge, bread in the pantry. Everything where it belonged. Except I didn‚Äôt remember getting there.

At first, I blamed the wine. Those dinners were turning into rituals of excess, and I‚Äôve never been a heavyweight. But the gaps began showing up when I was sober. Deliberately, consciously sober.

**Tuesday:**¬†I woke in my office chair, fully dressed. Laptop open to three thousand words of marketing copy for a client I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was good‚Äîmy voice, my cadence. But I had no memory of writing it. No record in my email. My time-tracking app didn‚Äôt log a thing.

**Wednesday:**¬†I went to sleep in my bed. Woke up at 3:33 AM, seated in a forgotten chair in the spare room, staring at a wall where a mirror used to hang. It was gone, leaving a dustless outline. My legs ached like I‚Äôd been standing for hours.

And then came¬†**Thursday**‚Äîthe reflection. While brushing my teeth, I noticed a lag. A fractional delay between me and the mirror. Barely there‚Ä¶ until it was. I‚Äôd raise a hand, and my reflection followed‚Äîjust off-beat. Smile. Blink. Move. Sometimes it matched me. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt.

Thursday night was yet another drunk dinner at Theo's home on Main Street overlooking the river that I barely remember.

And by¬†**Friday**, I broke. I woke to a voice memo on my phone‚Äîrecorded at 4:17 AM. My voice, but wrong. Too formal. Too precise.

‚ÄúTo Marcus. May the ninth chair always be filled.‚Äù

Then silence. Breathing‚Äînot mine. Deep. Rhythmic. Satisfied. There were seventeen more. All recorded between 3 and 5 AM over the past week.

‚ÄúThe ninth chair must be filled.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarcus knows the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúEight is incomplete. Nine is divine.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming home.‚Äù

The last was the longest‚Äî**forty-three minutes**, timestamped during the exact time I‚Äôd been at Elliott‚Äôs dinner. I remembered being there. I remembered the food, the synchronized movements. But the recording‚Ä¶ It was a dinner party. Clinking glasses, laughter, casual conversation. My voice, warm and natural, deeply woven into theirs.

‚ÄúThis duck is perfection, Graham.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember Prague, Theo? The restaurant by the bridge.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should vacation again. The nine of us. Like old times.‚Äù

Old times I hadn‚Äôt lived. Inside jokes I didn‚Äôt understand. But I delivered them like second nature. And beneath it all, another voice‚Äî*also*¬†mine, just slightly off. Speaking in tandem. Echoing ahead.

One voice sounded like me pretending to fit in. The other like me finally returning. I threw the phone across the room. It cracked, but the evidence remained: I was being overwritten. Replaced.

Shaking, I reached for coffee‚Äîsomething normal, something grounding. I opened the usual cabinet but grabbed a mug from another. Burgundy with a gold rim. Not mine. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought something so pretentious. But it felt familiar. Right. Like it belonged to me.

I dropped it. Watched it shatter across the floor. Burgundy shards like blood. My hands trembled as I swept them up, a strange grief settling in my chest.

*Marcus‚Äôs cup,*¬†a voice whispered.  
*Your cup,*¬†another replied.

I poured coffee into a different mug, but it tasted wrong. Everything tasted wrong. I wanted it stronger. Wanted oat milk. Wanted things I‚Äôd never liked before‚Äîbut that part of me suddenly craved.

I was unraveling. Losing memories, habits, preferences. Being replaced by someone who moved through this town with confidence, who belonged to these men, who toasted to long-dead dinners with perfect timing.

Someone who had done this before. Someone named Marcus. Someone who looked exactly like me‚Äîbut sharper. Hungrier. More. Someone who wasn‚Äôt coming back. Someone who was already home.

**WEEK FIVE ‚Äì THEY‚ÄôRE IN MY HOUSE**

This Thursday, I told them I was sick. Not a total lie. I felt like my bones were shifting inside me, like my skin no longer fit. Food tasted wrong. Sleep came in flashes, broken by dreams of dinner parties I hadn‚Äôt attended but somehow remembered. My reflection had stopped pretending, moving however it pleased‚Äîsometimes watching me when I wasn‚Äôt watching it.

So when Graham texted about dinner at Rocco‚Äôs, I replied with a graphic food poisoning excuse. Added a nauseated emoji for good measure. Then I deadbolted the door, turned off the lights, and sat in the dark with a baseball bat across my lap like a suburban clich√©.

At exactly 7 PM, the doorbell rang. I didn‚Äôt move. It rang again. Then a knock‚Äîmeasured and rhythmic. Knock knock knock. Pause. Knock knock knock. Like a heartbeat.

‚ÄúJulian?‚Äù Graham‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúWe know you‚Äôre in there. Your car‚Äôs in the driveway.‚Äù

More knocking. More voices. Harmonizing with their knuckles.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt skip dinner,‚Äù Theo called, all warm amusement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tradition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe brought soup,‚Äù Rocco added. ‚ÄúFor your stomach.‚Äù

I stayed frozen, bat in my sweaty hands. Then the lock turned. The deadbolt I had set myself. It clicked open smoothly, like it had been waiting. Graham stepped in with a Dutch oven and a bottle of wine. The others filed in behind him, arranged like a ceremony. All smiling the same smile. All tilting their heads in concern.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never skipped,‚Äù Graham said, stepping inside without hesitation. ‚ÄúIt would break tradition.‚Äù

I wanted to protest. Scream. Swing the bat. But my body betrayed me‚Äîstepping aside, setting the bat down. Smiling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not feeling‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel better soon,‚Äù Henry said, patting my shoulder. His hand was cold.

They moved through my house like they‚Äôd always lived there. Elliott opened the exact cabinet with my grandmother‚Äôs untouched china. Bennett found wine glasses I didn‚Äôt remember owning. Jude and Trevor repositioned the dining table with practiced ease. Theo pulled a burgundy tablecloth from my linen closet‚Äîone I‚Äôd never seen‚Äîand snapped it open like unfolding wings.

In minutes, my modest space became Graham‚Äôs dining room. Then the smells started. Duck again. Always duck. Bread fresh from ovens that hadn‚Äôt been used. Wine decanting in glassware I didn‚Äôt own.

‚ÄúSit,‚Äù Graham said, guiding me to a chair I didn‚Äôt recognize. A high-backed, ornate thing positioned at the head of the table.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have nine chairs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do now,‚Äù Rocco said, placing soup in front of me. Steam curled in perfect spirals.

The others sat with synchronized precision. One moment standing, the next seated, napkins in laps, hands folded. I hadn‚Äôt cooked. But dinner was ready. Music played from invisible speakers. The lights flickered just enough to feel like candlelight.

‚ÄúEat,‚Äù they said in unison.

And I did. My hand lifted the spoon without asking me. The soup tasted like memories. Not metaphorically‚Äîliterally. Each bite triggered flashes of unfamiliar familiarity: different wallpaper, different decades, the same eight faces always around the table.

‚ÄúGood?‚Äù Theo asked.

I nodded. Because part of me remembered this soup. Loved this soup. Had always loved it.

When the duck arrived‚Äîagain, always the duck‚Äîthey raised their glasses.

‚ÄúTo Marcus,‚Äù they said, eyes fixed on me.

‚ÄúTo Marcus,‚Äù I echoed, the phrase slipping out like I‚Äôd rehearsed it.

‚ÄúMay the ninth chair always be filled,‚Äù we said together.

And I couldn‚Äôt tell which voice was mine. The wine tasted like coming home. Conversation flowed through me. My voice joined in without input, recalling Prague and New Orleans and Venice. Vacations I hadn‚Äôt taken. Memories I hadn‚Äôt lived.

‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù they‚Äôd say. And I would.

I looked closer‚Äîand saw it at last. They flickered. Age skipping like faulty film. Graham‚Äôs smile stretched too wide. Theo‚Äôs fingers moved in impossible patterns. Henry‚Äôs hair shifted from silver to black to‚Ä¶ something unnamed. And in their eyes‚Äîeight pairs‚ÄîI saw myself. Not my reflection. Not Marcus. But the role. The ninth. The hunger that needed a face.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù Graham said, and the candles flared.

‚ÄúWelcome home,‚Äù Rocco said, as the walls breathed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve missed you,‚Äù Bennett said, his face shifting.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve missed us,‚Äù Jude whispered‚Äîand God help me, I had.

The room dimmed. The music swelled. And for a moment, I saw the chain‚Äîendless ninth chairs across time. Men who looked like me. Who were me. Who became Marcus, or Julian, or whoever the ninth needed to be. Then it passed. The lights steadied. I was sitting with eight old friends, finishing a dinner I‚Äôd helped cook, planning next week‚Äôs at my house.

It had always been my turn. When they left‚Äîsynchronized, seamless‚ÄîI stood in the doorway, waving. The ninth chair remained. Ornate. Familiar. Mine. Had I inherited it? Found it at a sale? Or‚Ä¶ The memory slid through me like water. But I knew they‚Äôd be back. We‚Äôd all be back. Because Thursday dinners are tradition. And tradition is older than memory. And memory is just hunger with a good disguise.

**WEEK SIX ‚Äì THE WALLS ARE SHIFTING**

My house was now changing. It started small‚Äîdoorways slightly wider, hallways longer by a step or two. Easy to blame on sleep deprivation, paranoia. But Monday morning, I woke up and the walls were wrong. The bedroom was longer. Not by much‚Äîthree feet maybe‚Äîbut enough that my dresser no longer touched the wall. The window looked off, too small for the room. I measured. Twenty-two feet. It had always been nineteen. I checked the furniture receipts. Nineteen. The tape said twenty-two. The walls said twenty-two. Reality said twenty-two.

Tuesday: wallpaper. Burgundy Victorian with gold fleur-de-lis patterns that shimmered when I wasn‚Äôt looking. I hate wallpaper. I‚Äôve never had wallpaper. But my hands¬†*remembered*¬†hanging it. I peeled it back‚Äîfound more. Layer after layer, until I reached wood.

Wednesday: photographs. Frames I didn‚Äôt own, hung on rails that hadn‚Äôt existed yesterday. Dozens of pictures. Me, always me, in different decades. Seventies suits, eighties pastels, nineties grunge. Always at dinner. Always with the eight. Always Thursday. The oldest was a daguerreotype. Nine blurred figures. One of them had my posture. My smile.

I went to New Hope Photo. Asked if someone was developing photos under my name.

‚ÄúJust like always,‚Äù the clerk said.

Apparently, I‚Äôd been a customer since 1987. Different film types, different payments‚Äîbut the same name, same address. She handed me an envelope. Thirty-six exposures from last Thursday. Photos of me laughing, toasting‚Äîbut wearing a face that looked increasingly like Marcus.

‚ÄúWant to pre-pay for next week?‚Äù she asked.

I did. Automatically. Exact change, just like always. At home, the daguerreotype now hung above a fireplace that hadn‚Äôt existed that morning. Marble mantle. Candlesticks I‚Äôd ‚Äúinherited‚Äù from a grandmother who was still alive in Florida‚Äîand had never owned silver.

My phone rang.

‚ÄúDinner at Henry‚Äôs,‚Äù Graham said. ‚ÄúSeven sharp.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I heard myself say.

‚ÄúBring the ‚Äô82 Bordeaux.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù I replied‚Äîthough I didn‚Äôt own one.

But when I opened my wine rack, there it was. Dusty. Waiting. And I remembered buying it. Storing it. Tending to it. No‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt. Marcus did. Or Thomas. Or whichever version of me lived here last. I was being overwritten. By memories that weren‚Äôt mine but¬†*fit*me. Like clothes broken in by someone else. Like a house slowly reassembling itself around the shape of who I was becoming.

And the worst part? It felt like home. As much as my brain was telling me to get out of here, my body wanted to stay.¬†

**WEEK SEVEN ‚Äì THE MIRROR GAME**

I tested a theory. By now, my house couldn‚Äôt decide what century it belonged to. My bathroom had both a clawfoot tub and a smart shower that flickered in and out of existence. My fridge was sometimes an icebox, complete with blocks of ice that weren‚Äôt there the day before. Physics had packed up and left.

But nightmares follow rules. Patterns. And I‚Äôm good at patterns. So Thursday afternoon, before dinner at Henry‚Äôs, I ran an experiment. I set a mirror at the center of my dining table‚Äînot one of the ornate antique ones my house had started producing like mold, but a plain handheld mirror I bought that morning at CVS. Modern. Mine.

The ninth chair loomed at the head of the table, unmoved and unmovable. I‚Äôd tried once to drag it into the garage. Woke up bruised and sore with the chair back in its place, smug and waiting. So I left it. I sat at a normal seat. One place setting. One unscented candle. A glass of cheap wine with a screw cap. I wasn‚Äôt going for elegance‚ÄîI was testing reality.

I felt ridiculous. Like a kid saying ‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù into the mirror for a scare. But when I lit the candle, the flame burned¬†*burgundy*. The wine in my glass turned dark and rich without me sipping it. The mirror‚Äôs surface rippled, though I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

‚ÄúTo Marcus,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMay the ninth chair always be filled.‚Äù

My voice came out polished, ceremonial‚Äîlike I‚Äôd said it a thousand times. Nothing happened.

The candle flickered back to orange. The wine soured. The mirror showed only me‚Äîtired, drawn, circles under my eyes from too many nights of shallow sleep.

I was about to give up. Blame stress. Blame gas. Blame whatever supernatural HOA managed this nightmare of a town.

Then I noticed the silence.

Not quiet.¬†*Silence*. The kind that presses against your eardrums and makes your breath sound loud. My house had never been silent‚Äîthere was always music, creaking, whispers in languages I couldn‚Äôt place. But now: stillness. Weighted. Watching.

I looked back at the mirror. My reflection wasn‚Äôt alone. Eight figures stood behind me. Not shadows‚Äî*absences*. Voids where light didn‚Äôt go. Each stood behind a chair, hands resting like mourners at a wake.

I didn‚Äôt turn. I¬†*knew*¬†if I turned, they‚Äôd vanish. This was mirror truth. Reverse honesty. The kind that only shows up when you stop trying to see it. The figures sharpened. I could make out the shapes: Graham‚Äôs tall frame. Theo‚Äôs restless fingers. Henry‚Äôs rigid stance. All in their seats. All smiling. Not visibly‚Äîbut I¬†*felt*¬†the smiles. Proud. Expectant. The kind you give a child who finally ties their shoes. Not surprised. Just satisfied.

Rocco‚Äôs shape‚Äîbroader than the rest‚Äîraised a glass. The others followed, synchronized as ever. A silent toast.

*To Marcus,*¬†their gesture implied.

*To Julian,*¬†it corrected.

*To the Ninth,*¬†they agreed.

And I felt it‚Äîheatless, voiceless warmth. Approval. I blinked. They were closer.

Still behind the chairs, but leaning now, shadows stretching like fingers across the mirrored table. One‚ÄîBennett, maybe‚Äîtouched the back of the ninth chair. I felt it on my neck. Cold. Deliberate.

Then, in the mirror, my reflection spoke:

‚ÄúAlways nine.‚Äù

But I hadn‚Äôt moved my lips.

**WEEK EIGHT ‚Äì WHO IS MARCUS?**

I needed facts. Real, dusty, microfiche-level facts. Something outside my shifting house and misbehaving mirrors. The Free Library of New Hope sat squeezed between a wine bar and a crystal shop. Inside, it still smelled like old paper and quiet ambition‚Äîthe way libraries should.

The librarian, ancient in the timeless way of people who never retired, didn‚Äôt ask questions.

‚ÄúObits from 2009?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBasement. Microfilm before 2010. Digital after.‚Äù The basement stairs creaked like a countdown. The air smelled like mold and memory. I found 2009 easily. November‚ÄîThanksgiving.

I scrolled past strangers until I saw it:¬†**Marcus Langley. Age 34. Died suddenly.**

Two sentences. No cause of death. No survivors. No funeral details. Just a name, an age, and¬†*suddenly*‚Äîas if death had ambushed him. I printed it. The paper came out warm, damp, the ink already blurring.

Next, I searched for photos. The librarian had mentioned yearbooks‚Äîfull collection back to the ‚Äò50s.¬†*Town pride,*¬†she‚Äôd said. I did the math. If Marcus was 34 in 2009, he‚Äôd have graduated in 1995. I found him on page 47. It was like looking into a mirror. Not a resemblance.¬†*Me.*

Same eyebrow scar. Same crooked left ear. Same exact face. But in 1995, I was five years old, living in Jersey. Under his photo: Drama Club. Debate.¬†*Thursday Dinner Society.*¬†The name alone chilled me. And the friend quotes?

‚ÄúNever change, Marcus!‚Äù ‚Äì G.M.  
‚ÄúNine is divine!‚Äù ‚Äì T.K.  
‚ÄúSee you at dinner forever!‚Äù ‚Äì R.P.

His senior quote?¬†**‚ÄúMost likely to never leave.‚Äù**

Not a joke. A prophecy.

I flipped pages. Found a photo on page 173: nine teens around a dinner table in the home ec room. Eight familiar faces‚Äîyoung versions of Graham, Theo, the rest. Unmistakable, even with bad haircuts and teenage awkwardness.

At the head: Marcus. Me. Not me.

The caption:¬†*Thursday Dinner Society celebrates another year of culinary excellence and friendship. Meetings every Thursday, same time, same place, forever and always.*

Then I looked closer‚Äîreally studied the others. They looked¬†*Marcus‚Äôs*¬†age. Which meant if they were 18 in 1995, they should be in their late 40s now. But they weren‚Äôt. Graham maybe looked 45, but Bennett still looked 25. Jude maybe 30. Unless they hadn‚Äôt aged. Or had aged before. Or had graduated other years, other decades, other lives.

Unless Thursday Dinner wasn‚Äôt bound by time. I photocopied everything. Fed quarters into the machine until I had a pile of pages and proof. The last copy jammed, distorting Marcus‚Äôs face‚Äîour face‚Äîinto a kaleidoscope of features that weren‚Äôt mine but might be.

I stumbled upstairs. The librarian looked up over her half-moon glasses.

‚ÄúFind what you were looking for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said.

She smiled. For a moment, she looked¬†*younger*.

‚ÄúThey always come looking eventually,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe ninth ones. Trying to understand what they already know.‚Äù

I ran. Out past the wine bar, past the crystal shop, past people living in a world where mirrors behaved and houses didn‚Äôt rearrange themselves in the night.

At home, I laid the copies on my now-longer dining table. Studied Marcus‚Äôs face. My face. Our face. Until the lines blurred.

*Most likely to never leave.*

Not sentiment. Not praise.¬†*Instruction.*¬†Because the ninth chair doesn‚Äôt let you go. Because Marcus didn‚Äôt leave. Because no one ever really leaves. I was the new Marcus. Or the next version. Or the same version in a different decade. A face recycled. A role filled. A dinner that never ends. And I wasn‚Äôt arriving. I was¬†*returning*.

I had always been here. Just waiting for myself to catch up.

**WEEK NINE ‚Äì THE DINNER**

They asked me to¬†*officially*¬†host. Not invited‚Äî*asked*. Like it was owed.

Graham called Tuesday morning while I stared at yearbook pages, trying to find a difference between Marcus‚Äôs face and mine. There wasn‚Äôt one.

‚ÄúYour turn again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThursday. The ninth dinner. The penultimate.‚Äù

Of course. Nine chairs. Nine members. Nine dinners since I met them at the Logan Inn. But how many cycles before me? How many ninths had counted to nine before dissolving?

‚ÄúNext week is the tenth,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd you know what that means.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt. But a part of me nodded anyway.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù I started, but stopped.¬†Because I did. I¬†*knew*¬†how to host. The knowledge sat in my brain like furniture uncovered after a long absence.

¬†‚ÄúSeven o‚Äôclock,‚Äù Graham added. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the menu. It‚Äôs already decided.‚Äù

He hung up. I didn‚Äôt say yes. I didn‚Äôt need to. My answer had been written before I was. Tuesday and Wednesday passed in a trance. My hands wrote lists in a stranger‚Äôs handwriting. My feet took me to specialty shops I didn‚Äôt know existed. The shopkeepers greeted me by name. One corrected himself:

‚ÄúThe usual, Mr. Langley‚ÄîI mean, Vance.‚Äù

But we both knew he‚Äôd been right the first time.

By Thursday, the house had decided on Victorian. Ornate wood, candlelight, a kitchen outfitted in copper and cast iron. Meals were prepared without my help. Place settings appeared on their own. At 6:45, candles lit themselves.

At 7:00 they arrived. No knock. No door opening. Just¬†*presence*.

‚ÄúJulian,‚Äù Graham said, but it felt like he was addressing someone much older.

They moved through the space like they‚Äôd always lived there. Bennett adjusted a fork by millimeters. Theo tuned the silence. Henry checked the wine I didn‚Äôt remember buying but had clearly been saving for this. No one cooked. No one poured. But the food came, and the wine flowed. The table served itself. Time bent around us.

‚ÄúBeautiful evening,‚Äù Rocco said, though the windows showed only night.

‚ÄúThe ninth dinner,‚Äù Trevor said, lifting his glass. ‚ÄúAlways special.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways final,‚Äù Jude whispered.

‚ÄúNot final,‚Äù Henry corrected. ‚ÄúTransitional.‚Äù

They sat with perfect precision. Suddenly I was seated at the head. The ninth chair. I didn‚Äôt remember sitting down. The table felt warm beneath my palms. The courses passed like dream scenes. Soup flavored with memory. Salad that shimmered. The duck‚Äîalways the duck. Each bite brought flashes: different eras, same faces, same ritual. They spoke in riddles. Recollections from times that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. Dinners in cities that no longer existed. Ninths who had come before.

‚ÄúWhere do they go?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThe old ones?‚Äù

Eight faces turned to me. Smiling.

‚ÄúGo?‚Äù Graham echoed. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt go anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always here,‚Äù said Theo.

‚Äú*You‚Äôre*¬†always here,‚Äù said Henry.

And I understood. There was no replacement. Just accumulation. Marcus wasn‚Äôt gone. He was layered beneath me. And beneath him, others. All stacked in the ninth chair, century after century. At 9:09 exactly, they stood.

‚ÄúTo Marcus,‚Äù they said.

They looked at me.

‚ÄúTo Julian,‚Äù I tried to reply. But what came out was: ‚ÄúTo Marcus.‚Äù

The voice was mine‚Äîbut older. Hungrier. Practiced.

‚ÄúMay the ninth chair always be filled,‚Äù we said together.

The room spun. Time folded. And I¬†*fell*‚Äîthrough Marcus, through Thomas, through names lost to memory. Identity layered like wallpaper, peeling back and back and back.

I woke in the ninth chair. Fully dressed. Alone. Hands folded on the table. The others were gone. The dishes clean. The candles burned down to stubs, but still faintly flickering. The house was‚Ä¶ everything. Victorian and modern. Past and future. All times at once. I was still in my own clothes, but they¬†*felt*¬†different. Worn by someone older. A cufflink glinted on my wrist. Gold. Engraved. The letters shifted: J.L., M.L., T.P.‚Äînames that had worn this chair before me.

I removed it with practiced fingers. I had never worn cufflinks, but my hands had. I held it to the light‚Äîand saw: other hands, other nights, other dinners. A chain of selves, infinite and recursive, discovering what they already knew.

**THIS WEEK**

The day after the ninth dinner, it was like all 8 of them ceased to exist in the real world. Their homes are empty. The entire town seems to think I‚Äôm crazy when I ask about them.

And yes, I‚Äôve checked. I‚Äôve walked past each address from the past nine weeks. Graham‚Äôs grand colonial sits dark and completely empty now. Elliott‚Äôs glass cube of a house now wears three FOR SALE signs. Theo‚Äôs brownstone has no furniture‚Äîjust dust dancing in light that doesn‚Äôt come from any known source.

But I¬†*remember*¬†being inside. I remember the meals. My body still carries their weight. My tongue still recalls the wine.

Even online, they‚Äôre ghosts. No more Instagram profiles. No digital footprints. I even paid for background checks‚Äîempty. I hired a private investigator who called me sounding spooked.

‚ÄúThese people can‚Äôt exist,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut they do,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúEvery Thursday at 9:09 PM, they exist harder than anything else.‚Äù

The Logan Inn‚Äîthe bar where I first met them‚Äîclaims no knowledge of Graham or anyone in the group.

‚ÄúNo parties of eight,‚Äù the manager insisted, scrolling their records. ‚ÄúNot ever.‚Äù

I showed her the receipt from that night. She squinted like it was in a foreign language. The ink must have shifted‚Äîshowing a date from 2005.

‚ÄúYou feeling okay?‚Äù she asked. I laughed until she threatened to call someone.

Who would she call? The police? The therapists who‚Äôd offer diagnoses for conditions older than language?

That next night, I see them walk down my street. I watch from my window. Eight figures in sync stopping at my door. They didn‚Äôt knock. Didn‚Äôt speak. Just stood there‚Äîwaiting. Smiling. Their smiles said:¬†*We have time. We are time.*

They stood for what my clock called a minute, but my bones measured in centuries. Then they were gone. Not walked away. Just‚Ä¶ gone. As if a channel had changed. The porch light glowed over empty space.

I found myself at the door without remembering how I got there. Opened it. Stepped onto a porch that was wood, stone, and ancient dirt all at once. The street was silent. No cars. No dogs. No life. Just me and the weight of something watching.

Something glinted on the doormat‚Äîa gold cufflink. Matching the one in my pocket. Matching the ones I keep finding like breadcrumbs dropped in reverse. It was warm. Recently worn. When I straightened, I wasn‚Äôt alone. A figure stood just beyond the porch light. Not one of the eight‚ÄîI knew their shadows. This was someone else.¬†

Marcus. Not the memory. Not the metaphor. The¬†*Marcus*¬†from the photo. Sharp. Hungry-eyed. Wearing the burgundy shirt from the Thanksgiving image‚Äîand my skin remembered how that shirt felt.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing well, Julian,‚Äù he said. His voice was mine, but in a minor key. ‚ÄúBetter than Thomas. He fought it.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead,‚Äù I said. It felt important.

¬†‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù He stepped forward.

‚ÄúI was at dinner last week. And the week before. I‚Äôll be there next week. Death is just transition, Julian. Or would you prefer¬†*Marcus*¬†now?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Julian,‚Äù I said. But it felt like reciting a spell I no longer believed.

Marcus smiled‚Äî*my*¬†smile, but older. Practiced.

‚ÄúNames are clothes. I was Marcus for thirty-four years. Thomas before that. William before him. The time changes. The role doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat are¬†*they*?‚Äù

‚ÄúHungry,‚Äù he said.

He touched my chest. His hand passed¬†*through*¬†me, into the space where identity lives. I didn‚Äôt feel pain. I felt‚Ä¶ subtraction. Like shrugging off a coat.

‚ÄúThe others are aspects. Functions. Graham is welcome. Theo is rhythm. Henry is authority. They exist because the dinner does. And the dinner exists to feed the hunger.‚Äù

‚ÄúFed on what?‚Äù

‚ÄúTime. Identity. The tiny deaths we suffer when we try to be someone else.‚Äù

He withdrew his hand. My chest ached in its absence.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeding it for nine weeks now. Each dinner, you become less Julian. More‚Ä¶ us.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI want to leave,‚Äù I said.

But what I¬†*heard*¬†was:¬†‚ÄúI want to stay.‚Äù

Marcus stepped back. I saw through him‚Äînot transparently, but like layers: Thomas, William, others. Acetate ghosts.

‚ÄúYou came to New Hope to disappear. We let you. Gave you a new place to exist, a new role. A family that never leaves.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt what I wanted,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúOh, but it is. You¬†*chose*¬†the ninth chair, Julian. You walked straight to it.‚Äù

He was already fading, like a photo left in the sun.

‚ÄúNext Thursday everyone will return for your tenth dinner. Then the transition completes. I‚Äôll rest. You‚Äôll remain.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt come?‚Äù

He laughed‚Äî*my*¬†laugh, but stretched by centuries.

Simple idea but i dont see it widespread. I know how to make a steak from Lion's Mane mushroom and it would have a taste and a texture of meat, and mushroom has lot of proteins too. Maybe regulations are different? Idk. Lion's Mane mushroom is known and eaten for centuries and very specific looking so grown from kit and reputable farm should be no mixup or any issue. I watched vids and read some research, all saying Lion's Mane is healthy and can taste like meat or crab or shrimp depends on prep, but better - it's easily grown local unlike shrimp dragged out from south Pacific bottom sitting there with random waste. The issue i see is that this whole idea may be a bit foreign to people who can choose to approve or not a loan for me. So i wish i knew some successful fast food places where they have any mushroom that works like a steak or in crab / shrimp dishes,i dont see why would they not have success, yet i cant see in my area anything like it.

1lqegwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/queer/comments/1lqegwf/i_put_on_my_real_face_lgbt_fiction/,I Put On My Real Face -- LGBT+ Fiction,"It finally came about a month ago. The delivery I‚Äôd been waiting for.

I didn‚Äôt know what was in the box at first. It actually worried me that night when I first got home and saw it sitting outside the door because there was no shipping label---no note[.](https://scottsavino.com/i-put-on-my-real-face) Just a plain cardboard box.

*Who would just leave some unmarked box outside my door?* I wondered, a bit worried at first.

I decided to bring it inside and open it.

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh giddily and squeal to myself when I pulled back the flap and saw the face inside, resting on a nest of tissue paper.

I ordered it so long ago, I‚Äôd forgotten to keep an eye out for it. It wasn‚Äôt exactly the face I‚Äôd ordered, but really, really close. Close in the way I might have drawn myself with colored pencils as a teen. 

Not perfect, but *perfectly me.* 

I‚Äôd invented this face a dozen times in my head but I‚Äôd never seen it out loud. I‚Äôd read the warnings on the website that everyone‚Äôs idea of the perfect face might not match the mask they get, and that was true---I didn‚Äôt get exactly what I thought I was getting---what I got wasn‚Äôt perfect---the freckles were in the wrong spots. I expected it to have lips that weren‚Äôt quite this big and the cheekbones weren‚Äôt as prominent as I‚Äôd requested them to be‚Ä¶

I was just so happy with it anyway, because if I‚Äôm honest, I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was getting when I ordered---not really---and what they delivered to me was perfectly imperfect.

The surface of this mask wasn‚Äôt rubbery the way I‚Äôd worried it might be. It was smooth, the rich brown of the skin matched my skin tone perfectly and it wasn‚Äôt glossy like a Halloween mask might be. It didn‚Äôt have any strings or clasps. You just slip it over your head and you can wear it wherever you go.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be as soft as it was---the feel of the skin so tender and realistic---and I definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be warm when I pulled it over my head and started wearing it.

It fit my face like a familiar friend I‚Äôd forgotten and accidentally stumbled into at Walmart or something---you know the kind of interaction I mean, don‚Äôt you?---you run in the store just to grab something right quick and you bump into someone you haven‚Äôt seen in a real long time out of nowhere and you get to talking, catching up‚Ä¶as you do‚Ä¶and before you know it, you‚Äôve spent almost an hour talking to some girl you haven‚Äôt even seen since you were fifteen years old‚Ä¶and the best part is it‚Äôs as though you never missed a beat with her at all. It fit me kinda like that. It was seamless and the nose holes were aligned perfectly. When I looked at it in the mirror and blinked, the mask blinked with me. When I smiled, it smiled. 

I was so happy with it that I slept in it.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Nobody acted like anything was different about me, which was what I hoped for, but hadn‚Äôt expected. Not entirely. I knew the mask would be good, but I never expected wearing it would feel so natural. I definitely didn‚Äôt expect it to go almost completely unnoticed. But, I was living in a new city, after all.

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the name for the order, miss?‚Äù my barista that first morning asked.

I don‚Äôt know why I expected him to flinch when I told him my name---but that isn‚Äôt what happened---he just wrote it down and called out ‚ÄúTiana‚Äù when my order was ready and nobody looked at me sideways when I went up from the community table in the waiting area to collect it.

*Could this be real life?* I wondered. *Can nobody tell that I‚Äôm wearing this?* But, it was true, they couldn‚Äôt tell. 

But, there‚Äôs more because that wasn‚Äôt the only thing that changed for me that first morning---tons of people were wearing masks---I could see them everywhere and they seemed so obvious to me now. 

Mine wasn‚Äôt cheap‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but people all around me were wearing cheap ones. Something about my own mask made seeing the outlines of a phony face easier---more apparent‚Ä¶people just slapped these knockoffs over their true faces but those knockoffs didn‚Äôt fit them as perfectly as mine fit me. Most of their masks cast very noticeable shadows on their faces beneath that I could see---*shockingly clearly, actually*---now that I wore a mask of my very own.

A man on the subway wore one. It was sharp jawed and too angular for his skull. The eyeholes were wrong and I could tell right away by the shadows around his eyes.

A little boy near me could see it too---‚ÄùMommy,‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúWhy is that man‚Äôs face melting?‚Äù

And his mother shushed him to stop talking.

I‚Äôd never realized it before that first morning---lots of people---most people I passed actually, were all wearing them, covering their true faces beneath with masks they thought the rest of the world would find more pleasing than the real faces they were hiding.

When I say I started to see them everywhere, I really do mean *everywhere.*

\--------------------------------------------------------

The first few days felt like freedom.

This was the face I wanted. I could walk down the street without second-guessing myself. I could breathe. Nobody stared at me and the type of weirdos who ask people things that they shouldn‚Äôt be asking didn‚Äôt ask me nothing---mostly.

I had a few experiences that were actually quite frightening, if I‚Äôm being honest.

The one that sticks out in my mind was that old bitty who didn‚Äôt mind her own self the way she should‚Äôve been minding her own self and just leave me be the way she should have left me be.

It was early evening and she came out the doors of St. Marinos Cathedral as I passed it. I walked by that church every day---it was a spooky old gothic thing that sat in the center of my modern city like a wart, and this old lady was one of the wart-hairs. 

What needs to happen is for people like her to get plucked---child, that‚Äôs what I think---I really, really do. Nobody wants to buy nothing you‚Äôre selling, ma‚Äôam.

I didn‚Äôt realize she‚Äôd been following me---not at first---I just thought we were headed the same way. It wasn‚Äôt until the 4th block that I realized she was trying to keep up with me. I could hear her little kitten pumps tap-tap-tapping trying not just to match my stride, but to beat it so she could catch up to me. 

I turned back, glancing over my shoulder and gave her one of those up-and-down‚Äôs that you do when you‚Äôre trying to figure someone else out.

She didn‚Äôt look like she was wearing a mask---not at first---not until she opened her mouth.

‚ÄúHello, sweetheart,‚Äù she said, sweet, but not real sugar. She said it Splenda sweet‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSuch a pretty face. New?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know at first what to say, so when I collected my jaw from the sidewalk, the first thing out of my mouth was ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I know a mask when I see one. I‚Äôm not judging you, dear, I‚Äôm really not,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just worried.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I noticed the light glowing around the seams of her mask. It was pouring out of her mouth. She smiled those too-white dentures at me nice and big. That was when she pulled her own mask off and I could see that both of those plates---the top and the bottom one---had way too many teeth. 

The blinding white of that light was pouring out of every crack she had as she kept going on.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying to yourself. Everyone else is lying to you too. You see that don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

That glow was coming out of her mouth like a spotlight directly into my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt even see her awful teeth anymore. It was just that blinding light. It came out from everywhere‚Ä¶ 

She breathed it out her nose. 

It shot out of her eyes.

It even came out of her ears.

‚ÄúYou know who doesn‚Äôt lie?‚Äù She asked, waiting for me to respond. I didn‚Äôt.

She didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúGod. He can see who you really are.‚Äù

I turned around and started to double my steps. I just wanted to get away from her. 

‚ÄúMiss? Hey miss---he sees you. You know that don‚Äôt you? You think that mask hides you from Him?‚Äù She shouted after me.

I turned around.

‚ÄúLady, didn‚Äôt you just come out of a church?‚Äù I asked her, ‚Äúfollowing people at dusk like this---shouting at them---it isn‚Äôt very Christian of you. Go on home. Leave me alone and worry about yourself.‚Äù

Her face-glow flared brighter. I don‚Äôt know how any of this stuff works---not really. She hadn‚Äôt been wearing her mask for a few minutes, but taking it off did something to her. It made her real hot---I don‚Äôt mean mad, but she was that too---what I actually meant was I could see her heating up from the inside now. 

Hers must‚Äôve been keeping her cooler on the inside, because once she took it off and gripped it in her angry fist, she started to look hot---*actually* hot. Smoke rose from all the same spots that had glared that light at me. It must‚Äôve been happening the whole time. I just stood there, stunned, and watched her face begin to melt.

It dripped right off her skull---pink smears of coral lipstick landing on her purse strap, purple eyeshadow sliding down her blouse. Her cheeks puddled on the sidewalk like candle wax, and then that little cotton-ball of hair on her head burst into flames.

I ran all the way home.

For the first time since I got my mask, I felt unsure. I checked it in the mirror and blinked. It blinked too---but just a beat or two late. When I smiled, it smiled back‚Ä¶ but for a second, it looked like I had too many teeth. Ten or fifteen too many. Then I blinked again and the teeth were gone---but the smile still looked off. Like it wasn‚Äôt smiling right.

I didn‚Äôt think it was going to adjust back to working right the next morning when I woke up to go to work, and I cried real hard that night before I fell asleep. Harder than I‚Äôve cried in a long time. 

And I thought about taking it off and putting it in the trash.

But I decided not to.

When I woke up the next morning I realized I‚Äôd let myself get worked up about something I shouldn‚Äôt have and everything about my mask was back to normal.

\--------------------------------------------------------

The more I wore it, the more normal it felt to have, even with my moments of doubt. I‚Äôd wake up, breathe and stretch. I‚Äôd check it in the mirror for creases. There were never any creases. 

There better not be. This mask cost me a fortune.

In mirrors, the face was completely mine now. I didn‚Äôt worry about it not synching up with my movements because it moved like skin. It flushed when I got nervous. It got darker in the cheeks when I ran on the treadmill so fast I ran out of breath‚Ä¶

That second or third week, after my encounter with the church lady, I started noticing other people whose masks had that light coming out of them. They stared just a little bit too long, until those stares turned into glares and it was like they were trying to pick me apart.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday---now, yesterday was the best day I had since that unmarked cardboard box got delivered to my door.

I was sitting at the cafe on my lunch break, reading, and I noticed a man there looking at me and when I noticed him and we locked eyes well, I saw the seams of his mask glowing, but it wasn‚Äôt glowing in the same way that the people who glared at me seemed to glow. I could see the whole outline of his mask‚Ä¶

Where it met with his chin‚Ä¶

And around the eyeholes‚Ä¶

And the noseholes‚Ä¶

It was amazing. Gleaming light that seemed to sparkle like a prism or a diamond‚Ä¶and while he smiled at me, he lifted his coffee up in a silent toast and that‚Äôs what made me want to get up and say hello to him.

I approached him and asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it about you that seems so familiar?‚Äù

And he said gently: ‚ÄúI like your mask.‚Äù

I just stood there dumbfounded and didn‚Äôt respond right away because it was the first time that I‚Äôd ever seen someone who wore a mask that did that.

‚ÄúIt took me forever to get my face right, too.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shining right? Looks like diamond light.‚Äù

I paused, ‚ÄúYea. About that. I haven‚Äôt seen a mask do that before?‚Äù

The glowing flickered and I could see the face he had beneath his mask. He was about my age, and his eyes were as tired as I felt but still very kind. He had a lip piercing. Was it his mask or his real face? I couldn‚Äôt tell. It looked like a real face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wearing my mask. Not anymore,‚Äù He said. His skin seemed to be alive, glittering around the edges like tiny soft creatures draped in white danced around the outline of his face, gracing him with their radiant kiss. ‚ÄúI stopped having to wear it a long time ago. Just keep wearing yours and your face will shine exactly like mine is. The best part about it is I can see my own face sparkle in the mirror the same way you‚Äôre seeing it now. It took a while for the face I had on underneath to adapt and change---get molded just right---but one day I woke up and I finally felt it was safe to take mine off‚Ä¶so I took it off. I‚Äôve been shining ever since.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long did you have to wear it before you started to---uh---well, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúA while, but it‚Äôs different for everyone.‚Äù

I told him I had to get back to work, and he said he had better do that too and I smiled as pretty as I could make myself do for no reason at all. I was acting just like a silly little teen again. I felt giggly inside as I did it, but I just couldn‚Äôt stop smiling.

He gave me his number before he headed on his way.

We‚Äôre getting dinner tonight and I haven‚Äôt been this excited in a long, long time.

If you‚Äôre thinking about getting one of these masks and you‚Äôre wondering how good they are---listen, you don‚Äôt have to spend the kind of money I spent on mine to shine like that, if you want to do it, I mean, sure go ahead...but...I don‚Äôt think you have to spend any money at all.

Before we parted ways he told me something.

Something I didn‚Äôt even know was possible for someone to do.

Now listen, I‚Äôm happy with the money I spent on mine, but honey if you ain‚Äôt got the cash, I‚Äôm telling you, you don‚Äôt need it. 

Not really.

A few temporary masks that were a little strange.

For me, it flares up hard when my gut‚Äôs off, especially when I travel. I‚Äôve been trying to treat methane SIBO for a while, and more recently realised sulfur intolerance might be the missing piece. (When I travel its often double coffee, eggs for breakfast, margaritas at dinner... basically sulfur bomb central. Major bummer.) Dermatologist wasn't super helpful they just recommended solantra which Im not convinced has a big impact.

Anyway, I recently saw a cosmetic doctor and explained what was going on. She recommended Profhilo in the lower face and baby Botox in the forehead to help hydrate the skin, calm inflammation, and manage oil.

Honestly, it‚Äôs changed my life. I used to get angry red flares every time my gut acted up. Now, even if my gut‚Äôs not happy, my skin stays calm. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a cure, but it‚Äôs been a total confidence saver.

I‚Äôll include a few pics:

* First is a collage of my worst flares
* Second is me now, with just sunscreen and fake tan
* Third is with BB cream, bronzer, and lipliner

Totally get that this approach won‚Äôt be for everyone, and for me it‚Äôs definitely a bit of a bandaid. But as someone pushing 40, the whitehead flares were really affecting my confidence at work and socially. I found myself staying home more. That‚Äôs not the case anymore.

Happy to answer any questions if you‚Äôre curious.

What a wonderful place you have!,"We are North Indians who came to visit Thrissur and it was a fabulous trip. I would keep the best part at the end of this post.

We visited Vadakkumnathan Temple and Guruvayoor Temple. Both the temples left us spell bounded. The architecture, particularly Vaddakumnathan, is so different and the rituals are so unique. We loved the premise of the Vadakkumnathan temple with huge trees and peace. Everybody was so quite and well behaved. Thankfully my kids got to see the elephants at Guruvayoor.

We visited the Chavakkad beach and our children went bonkers seeing the ocean. I had posted earlier in this sub-reddit and people advised us against Athirapally Falls but we went ahead and went to the falls. It is monsoon so I think the beauty of the Athirapally Falls was at full bloom. Our jaw dropped seeing the place, especially the road from Chalakudy to Athirapally. Literally scenic beauty from the heavens since I belong to a dry and hot place.

Since it was religious sort of a trip, we preferred vegetarian food. Hotel Bharath and Pathan's were our place to go and we loved the food. Man the authentic Mallu Puttu, Dosa and Idiyappam with Kadla curry or Korma stew were so delicious. Had our coffee at Indian Coffee house and liked it as well.

Somebody suggested us to go to Poomala Dam and the place did not disappoint. There is nothing very special about the place but you feel good there. Again we went to the stream flowing and spent a jolly time. In the evening, we relaxed at the park of Vadakkumnathan temple in front of Indian Coffee House. We sat there with our kids enjoying running up and down the slope. Our only wrong decision was to go to Sobha Mall - I mean it was just a mall and we could have visited other places.

The best part is THE PEOPLE. We treated so well and kindly by the people who helped us throughout the trip. May be some auto chettas overcharged us but that is fine. The bus driver from Thrissur to Chalakudy was driving as if he had just seen Brad Pitt's F1 movie. LOL!

My husband and I have been together six years, married for four. He has four kids from another marriage, one is grown and gone, One lives with us full-time 16 year-old female And the younger two live with their mom 50% of the time.
We were coming back from a trip a few weeks ago and had a layover in San Francisco early morning. It was my husband, myself and our 16-year-old. All of us love coffee. Since we were catching another flight, I wanted coffee, but not too much so I asked my husband to Get an extra large one so we can share. He and daughter left and came back with three coffees and a breakfast for her. they hand me a coffee, which was a surprise to me since I didn‚Äôt want a full serving, but I drink half and gave the rest to my husband.
Fast-forward an hour or so later. We are on our flight and daughter says she can‚Äôt finish her coffee. I agree with her that the coffees were really big and I didn‚Äôt finish mine either. She said hers and Dad‚Äòs were extra big and that mine was different. I asked her what does she mean and she said that my coffee was from Burger King where she got her breakfast and theirs was from Petes coffee, which is where I had asked to get my coffee from..
My husband wasn‚Äôt sitting near us so I could not ask him about it. When we get off the plane and in our car to come home, I told him that I know he ended up giving me the crappier coffee. He told daughter that it was supposed to be a secret and not to tell me. 
So of course, this angers me and I tell him that he‚Äôs being an ableist and is taking advantage of my blindness. I felt like if daughter was getting a breakfast and a coffee comes with it then she should drink that coffee. he doesn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong and is standing his ground. He states that since I didn‚Äôt want my own coffee anyway that getting one from Burger King is not a big deal. Yes in the long run it‚Äôs not a big deal, but the fact that he use my blindness against me is the issue and I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble feeling like I can be with someone who sees nothing wrong and taking advantage of my blindness. so am I overreacting or do I have reason to stand my own ground?

[Bitter Momma Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6Y9MZ2NbYQsG3PS69) in Paranaque received 5-star reviews from certain persons named *Arnold Bautista*, *Shane Uy*, and *Raymond F*, but the same reviewer gave 1-star ratings to several other caf√©s nearby.

If the reviewers are connected to the caf√© in any way, that would fall under conflict of interest and violate Google‚Äôs policies. Just putting this out there for awareness, especially for other local caf√©s that might‚Äôve been affected. 

I'm a small retail business owner, so seeing petty injustices like this needs to get called out.

I ended the 5 yr relationship on 5/9 So been living together since then, end of lease 7/15. A week after breakup the ex started ‚Äúseeing‚Äù a bunch of guys and I believe caught something. Lol. But don‚Äôt say anything. Shhhh! 

Anyway This week,  I have a bar meet with a woman Thursday night, date Friday night, and coffee date on Sunday.  Which is funny because I have only been out on a couple of dates the past month.  So plenty of distractions. Chatting with a couple of others so Sat is still in play. 

But!  I have been really good about no contact and only talking when it concerns move out shit.   I have never liked doing good bye forever. I would rather disappear and just keep detaching emotionally.  

I worry I will be cornered sometime this week.  I don‚Äôt want to be a dick and I don‚Äôt want  drama to ensue.   I am not going to say shit that I don‚Äôt mean.  Good luck.  No.   Hope you find happiness.  No.  I don‚Äôt hate her but forgiveness has not arrived yet. 

So here are the options

1) walk away even if she tries to talk to me  (you know the scene in office space where lundgren tries to stop the guy and he walks around him lol) 

2) say nothing to anything she says 
Maybe a head nod or grunt or just say bye.. 

3) end the relationship like it started.
When I first met her I planted a big kiss on her which turned heated.  I was thinking of saying that and say hopefully you don‚Äôt slap me and then smooch and walk away.

It‚Äôs been about three days since my first date with a 32F. The date itself went really nicely. We had a coffee date and got to know each other personally.

Since the date, however, communication has slowed down to trickles, and my anxiety has spiked as a result. For me, it‚Äôs hard to look past my anxiety that comes with any prolonged silence.

After spending a few hours jotting down my feelings, patterns from past dating experiences, and what I value in connection, I concluded that I‚Äôm not OK with prolonged silence. I am worthy of at least a ‚Äúhello‚Äù or a short check-in text, even if someone is busy.

Yesterday, I sent her a message saying I‚Äôd be open to another date but also that I appreciate clarity and small check-ins every once in a while, just so I know where we stand. So far, no reply, and I‚Äôve nearly chosen to end the communication between us.

Am I overreacting by guarding myself against the possibility of being ghosted? Or is it fair to expect at least some kind of check-in, even if delayed by a day or two?

Hi there, my online name is Ponder.

I'm posting here to vent/cry/release this whelming unseen feeling as a man, in a world where i feel im always a threat because of my gender. Thank you for clicking on my post today, i hope something today makes you feel supported and seen.

I want to tell you a bit about my energy  as a displaying heterosexual cis man. before you scroll away, I said displaying. I was and am for the time being married to a woman, I have a beautiful child who I still try and raise with love toward this woman. His mom really is a wonderful soul. I knew her for 12 years before we got pregnant,

As a young man who came from emotional and physical abuse, seperated parents, drug addicted households, schizophrenia in atleast one household, poverty, racial abuse, body dismorphia, adhd, etc etc, I felt as though I could see her as a human that I always loved. 

I want to give perspective on the significant things that shape my ""masculine traits"" as well as my ""feminine traits"" as well. I believe that these traits exist in all of us, and they don't exclusively exist in one gender or another. 
I believe this is why I have had 4 relationships, where there was some sort of queer, or LGBT themes. I mean 2 because obviously they were men, but the other 2 women, because they went on to be in relationships with women. This new ability to communicate amongst ourselves online has given us so many safe places to be open that it's allowed for such discourse as r/postgenderism or r/guycry to exist. 

I am man because I have a penis, not because I'm motivated toward my career. Motivated toward financial safety and toward ensuring financial safety for my family. I am a man AND I am confident and strongly rooted in who I am and the structure of my family values. I am a man because I ejaculate sperm, not because I held my son against my bare chest in the first days of his life while his beautiful mother recovered from a c-section. 

I'm a man because I teach my son how to talk about his feelings when hes upset, to show love and care and empathy toward others. I'm a dad because when I climb on the playground and monkey around the same ways I would when I was young and show my son the athletic creativity a playground set can offer. I'm a man because when the angsty teenage boy working the hot food section at the grocery store made my wife feel small, I step up and make sure I correct the order because I listened to her speak. I'm a man because I stand up for others and what is right in my community, when a child or adult is visibly having a hard time in public, at the park, on the train, or at Costco. We reach out and support those people around us. I'm a man because when I see a person with a flat tire I stop. Im a man bc I see a neighbor stripped the screws on his acura doing a brake job, I hit it with my man purse! and I walk away no expectations, just a smile and a hand shake. I'm a man because when my friend needs a free/ extra cheap brake job, I got you ;). I'm not a man because I like boob jokes, and jokes about the nasty. I'm not a man because I drive a coupe and like to make my son excited when daddy's car goes noooom! Nor because I wear cologne, and men's deodorant, or shoes, or a men's watch. My ear piercings closed years ago.

I'm not a woman, but I care about my hair, clothes and the way i look outwardly in the world. I dont clear the polishing dust from my eyes on purpose. 
I like my guy liner, and im going to wear it every time im out and about on the town from now on. Im not a woman but i want my scarred hands to look nice, clean, and manicured to my preference. I want to smell nice and feel warm when i hug my loved ones.Offer them food, to do my tender love and care to restore my space to its intended warmth.  and be the best goddam host you've ever visited, even if youre not my guest. I'm not a woman because I serve you coffee/tea/water/coke zero/Pepsi max when you enter my home, after I've vacuumed, rearranged, tidied, sprayed and wiped every surface, serviced the porcelain, emptied sinks, and garbage.Im not a woman because the first thing I do when I see you is ask for love, touch and affection, because im excited to see you. 

I'm not a woman because I want to hold hands. Or because I have bunnies tattooed on my arm, or because I want roses and carnations ( and spiders) sleeved around my bunnies. Im not a woman, or gay because i find a specific type of man attractive. Nor are me and my friends gay for having the arguement of whos taking our asses between deadpool or wolverine. I'm not a woman because I care deeply about my relationships, and want to support people around me. Im not a woman but i can hear the sad in your voice when you talk about the way your spouse treats you. The way your friends dont show up for you, the way your mom hurts you when she says mean things. Im not a woman but i underatand the pressures from parents of different backgrounds, traditions, expectations and generational trauma. Misogyny AND Misandry. don't have breasts, but I wake up at any hour of the night to feed my child. I don't have a vagina, but I prefer to sit and pee when I'm feeling safe in my home.

 I didn't carry my son, I didn't get to feel that relationship grow for almost a year before meeting him, but I love him so deeply. I didn't have to experience carrying a child, or birthing one, or the trauma of everything in between. There is so much more I could have done to be supportive of his mama when she carried him.

I wasn't raised in a house that displayed healthy perfect love, but I knew what it was supposed to feel like when a home is safe. I don't know how to love another person properly, but I'll learn through loving myself, and raising my child on that love. He is so beautiful, raising a child is so wonderful, and im so blessed to experience this in my lifetime as a cis man. I will do my part to raise a healthy man by providing a safe, intentional, space for my baby. 

I'm human, and I will grow.

In saying all of this, I want others to feel comfortable expressing their masculine and feminine expressions. I like to believe this is grounding in a chaotic universe. 

I want to encourage others to be curious, and to be guilt free when expressing their interest in others' soul experience. We all have a valuable story to tell when we can be vulnerable and safe in our homes, our communities, and in the legacy we leave in peoples hearts. 

Be patient, give grace to others and yourself too! and Accept the mistakes you make, because you can grow from them.

I hope to see a world where women and men can feel safe around each other when they allow themselves to be vulnerable together. Where women aren't choosing the bear, and men aren't choosing the tree. Please pardon me nonbinary allies. maybe you can find another object in nature you'd rather communicate with than your partner sometimes. Be vulnerable with eachother and support anyone and everyone, anywhere, in any way you can. <3‚úåÔ∏èüíñüåà<3

1lqdshv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1lqdshv/ryan_roth_13_million_conman_a_faked_death_still/,"Ryan Roth: $13 million conman, a faked death, still at large","I want to be clear, I am the most active investigator and expert on this case, alongside Roth's uncle, Sean Flynn. I met Roth in 2008 while he was still active. I've interviewed dozens of witnesses and done the primary research to reconstruct Roth's 20 year criminal career. I've befriended many of his ex-victims.

Roth is a person of interest to the UK Serious Fraud Office, LAPD, Australian Federal Police, Japanese Police, and Bali Police.

Here is one of the many headlines printed after his fake death:¬†[British man suspected of FAKING his death in Bali is 'a serial con man' | Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8021795/British-man-suspected-FAKING-death-Bali-serial-man.html)

Ryan Roth is a serial conman who stole $13 million over the course of his career, including two major scores before he faked his death: Kabu&Co (2017-2020) and Malala Coffee (2015-2016). These were socially conscious investment scams that fooled a lot of rich corporate types as well as everyday people looking to invest for retirement that cleared him several million dollars. He's also posed as the founder of charities (the most notorious being the White Orchid Foundation where he claimed to rehouse ex-child sex slaves), other socially conscious businesses, entertainment management firms, filmmaking firms, visual art management firms, art galleries, architecture firms, and a litany of smaller scores from mail fraud to rental scams. He's sometimes preyed on society's most vulnerable who could ill-afford it. His career took him from the UK, to US, to Australia and New Zealand, to Japan, Thailand, and ultimately Bali, where he disappeared.

His fake death was so sloppily done that the Bali cops immediately ruled it out and declared him a missing person. He also had two passports, one he left at the scene, and had booked a flight out of Bali for Singapore that night. The flight records show he, or someone posing as him, was on the plane. Nobody of any authority, and nobody who knows him seriously believes Roth is dead. His private social media was also updated and active in the months and years after his death.

In addition to the above, Roth is mentally unstable, having been sectioned under the UK Mental Health Act and having escaped from a low-security facility. He has all the appearances of a textbook psychopath. He is an abuser of women. He has a chronic venereal disease but has unprotected sex with strangers (he also didn't like taking his medication). He robbed his own relatives of large sums, including his ailing grandmother and his late mother.

Theories extend from Roth hiding out in the UK, or somewhere in East Asia among expat groups (which he preferred), or may have lit out for new frontiers. Shortly before his disappearance, Roth was researching online places in Japan, so he may have returned there. We don't know. And it has been half a decade and he ran off with millions of dollars to keep himself afloat.

Ryan's uncle, Sean Flynn, operates an email tip line, which I am prohibited from posting here. But I am happy to provide it via DM or relay any comments on this thread to him.

Details on Roth's career are pretty thin on the ground and the old headlines say practically nothing. But here are two sources that go into detail about Roth's criminal career:

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I met Roth in 2008 while he was still active. I've interviewed dozens of witnesses and done the primary research to reconstruct Roth's 20 year criminal career. I've befriended many of his ex-victims.  
  
Roth is a person of interest to the UK Serious Fraud Office, LAPD, Australian Federal Police, Japanese Police, and Bali Police.  
  
Ryan Roth is a serial conman who stole $13 million over the course of his career, including two major scores before he faked his death: Kabu&Co (2017-2020) and Malala Coffee (2015-2016). These were socially conscious investment scams that fooled a lot of rich corporate types as well as everyday people looking to invest for retirement that cleared him several million dollars. He's also posed as the founder of charities (the most notorious being the White Orchid Foundation where he claimed to rehouse ex-child sex slaves), other socially conscious businesses, entertainment management firms, filmmaking firms, visual art management firms, art galleries, architecture firms, and a litany of smaller scores from mail fraud to rental scams. He's sometimes preyed on society's most vulnerable who could ill-afford it. His career took him from the UK, to US, to Australia and New Zealand, to Japan, Thailand, and ultimately Bali, where he disappeared.

His fake death was so sloppily done that the Bali cops immediately ruled it out and declared him a missing person. He also had two passports, one he left at the scene, and had booked a flight out of Bali for Singapore that night. The flight records show he, or someone posing as him, was on the plane. Nobody of any authority, and nobody who knows him seriously believes Roth is dead. His private social media was also updated and active in the months and years after his death. 

In addition to the above, Roth is mentally unstable, having been sectioned under the UK Mental Health Act and having escaped from a low-security facility. He has all the appearances of a textbook psychopath. He is an abuser of women. He has a chronic venereal disease but has unprotected sex with strangers (he also doesn't like taking his medication). He robbed his own relatives of large sums, including his ailing grandmother and his late mother. 

Theories extend from Roth hiding out in the UK, or somewhere in East Asia among expat groups (which he preferred), or may have lit out for new frontiers. Shortly before his disappearance, Roth was researching online places in Japan, so he may have returned there. We don't know. And it has been half a decade and he ran off with millions of dollars to keep himself afloat. 

Ryan's uncle, Sean Flynn, operates a tip line: [catchryan@hotmail.com](mailto:catchryan@hotmail.com) if you have an information.

Details on Roth's career are pretty thin on the ground and the old headlines say practically nothing. But here are two sources that go into detail about Roth's criminal career:

Hi there, my online name is Ponder.

I'm posting here to vent/cry/release this whelming unseen feeling as a man in a world where i feel as though my energy as a man is a constant threat to people around me. Thank you for clicking on my post today, i hope something today makes you feel supported and seen.

I want to tell you a bit about my energy  as a displaying heterosexual cis man. before you scroll away, I said displaying. I was and am for the time being married to a woman, I have a beautiful child who I still try and raise with love toward this woman. His mom really is a wonderful soul. I knew her for 12 years before we got pregnant,

As a young man who came from emotional and physical abuse, seperated parents, drug addicted households, schizophrenia in atleast one household, poverty, racial abuse, body dismorphia, adhd, etc etc, I felt as though I could see her as a human that I always loved. 

I want to give perspective on the significant things that shape my ""masculine traits"" as well as my ""feminine traits"" as well. I believe that these traits exist in all of us, and they don't exclusively exist in one gender or another. 
I believe this is why I have had 4 relationships, where there was some sort of queer, or LGBT themes. I mean 2 because obviously they were men, but the other 2 women, because they went on to be in relationships with women. This new ability to communicate amongst ourselves online has given us so many safe places to be open that it's allowed for such discourse as r/postgenderism or r/guycry to exist. 

I am man because I have a penis, not because I'm motivated toward my career. Motivated toward financial safety and toward ensuring financial safety for my family. I am a man AND I am confident and strongly rooted in who I am and the structure of my family values. I am a man because I ejaculate sperm, not because I held my son against my bare chest in the first days of his life while his beautiful mother recovered from a c-section. 

I'm a man because I teach my son how to talk about his feelings when hes upset, to show love and care and empathy toward others. I'm a dad because when I climb on the playground and monkey around the same ways I would when I was young and show my son the athletic creativity a playground set can offer. I'm a man because when the angsty teenage boy working the hot food section at the grocery store made my wife feel small, I step up and make sure I correct the order because I listened to her speak. I'm a man because I stand up for others and what is right in my community, when a child or adult is visibly having a hard time in public, at the park, on the train, or at Costco. We reach out and support those people around us. I'm a man because when I see a person with a flat tire I stop. Im a man bc I see a neighbor stripped the screws on his acura doing a brake job, I hit it with my man purse! and I walk away no expectations, just a smile and a hand shake. I'm a man because when my friend needs a free/ extra cheap brake job, I got you ;). I'm not a man because I like boob jokes, and jokes about the nasty. I'm not a man because I drive a coupe and like to make my son excited when daddy's car goes noooom! Nor because I wear cologne, and men's deodorant, or shoes, or a men's watch. My ear piercings closed years ago.

I'm not a woman, but I care about my hair, clothes and the way i look outwardly in the world. I dont clear the polishing dust from my eyes on purpose. 
I like my guy liner, and im going to wear it every time im out and about on the town from now on. Im not a woman but i want my scarred hands to look nice, clean, and manicured to my preference. I want to smell nice and feel warm when i hug my loved ones.Offer them food, to do my tender love and care to restore my space to its intended warmth.  and be the best goddam host you've ever visited, even if youre not my guest. I'm not a woman because I serve you coffee/tea/water/coke zero/Pepsi max when you enter my home, after I've vacuumed, rearranged, tidied, sprayed and wiped every surface, serviced the porcelain, emptied sinks, and garbage.Im not a woman because the first thing I do when I see you is ask for love, touch and affection, because im excited to see you. 

I'm not a woman because I want to hold hands. Or because I have bunnies tattooed on my arm, or because I want roses and carnations sleeved around my bunnies. Im not a woman, or gay because i find a specific type of man attractive. Nor are me and my friends gay for having the arguement of whos taking our asses between deadpool or wolverine. I'm not a woman because I care deeply about my relationships, and want to support people around me. Im not a woman but i can hear the sad in your voice when you talk about the way your spouse treats you. The way your friends dont show up for you, the way your mom hurts you when she says mean things. Im not a woman but i underatand the pressures from parents of different backgrounds, traditions, expectations and generational trauma. Misogyny AND Misandry. don't have breasts, but I wake up at any hour of the night to feed my child. I don't have a vagina, but I prefer to sit and pee when I'm feeling safe in my home.

 I didn't carry my son, I didn't get to feel that relationship grow for almost a year before meeting him, but I love him so deeply. I didn't have to experience carrying a child, or birthing one, or the trauma of everything in between. There is so much more I could have done to be supportive of his mama when she carried him.

I wasn't raised in a house that displayed healthy perfect love, but I knew what it was supposed to feel like when a home is safe. I don't know how to love another person properly, but I'll learn through loving myself, and raising my child on that love. He is so beautiful, raising a child is so wonderful, and im so blessed to experience this in my lifetime as a cis man. I will do my part to raise a healthy man by providing a safe, intentional, space for my baby. 

I'm human, and I will grow.

In saying all of this, I want others to feel comfortable expressing their masculine and feminine expressions. I like to believe this is grounding in a chaotic universe. 

I want to encourage others to be curious, and to be guilt free when expressing their interest in others' soul experience. We all have a valuable story to tell when we can be vulnerable and safe in our homes, our communities, and in the legacy we leave in peoples hearts. 

Be patient, give grace to others and yourself too! and Accept the mistakes you make, because you can grow from them.

I hope to see a world where women and men can feel safe around each other when they allow themselves to be vulnerable together. Where women aren't choosing the bear, and men aren't choosing the tree. Please pardon me nonbinary allies. maybe you can find some other object in nature you'd rather communicate with than your partner sometimes. Be vulnerable with eachother and support anyone and everyone, anywhere, in any way you can. <3‚úåÔ∏èüíñüåà<3

I AM IN NO WAY A REPAIRMAN OR LICENSED FOR ADVICE. IM JUST A GIRL WHO LOVES COFFEE AND WAS REALLY EXCITED TO USE HER NEW MACHINE. 
I would just really hate to see people get rid of an expensive machine over a simple fix. 

MAKE SURE SHES UNPLUGGED AND COOLED DOWN. 
I suggest doing this on a towel or something that you don't mind getting wet. 
It took a lot of guesswork to open her up. 
1. This may take some pressure but remove all 4 screws from underneath by the group head. 
2. There should be 2 holes closest to the edge that go pretty deep but you'll need a Phillips head screwdriver long enough to reach down there and unscrew thos. Set screws aside. 
3. Flip machine back over 
4.Remove the tank to access the 2 screws on the back of the machine. 
5.Gently pry the backend off a little and there are going to be a clip on either side inside just before the seam. 
6. With whatever you choose to use to pry the lid off slide that in between the cup warmer and the side to wedge the side wall out a little. You should hear a click when successful.
7. Those  2 screws we removed earlier should be the last things holding the top on. Gently remove that cover and gaze up on the inner working of your machine. 

In my instance the piece that broke was what's called the Universal F Tee Adapter which is unfortunately not Easily accessible on Amazon and would have gotten here in like 3 weeks. So I just super glued that back together and I'm hoping it holds well enough to make my coffee. 

Like I said I'll try to attach any photos I can to make visuals easier.

1lqd7qn,https://i.redd.it/p7dlmb06zjaf1.png,Isaac Francois Info (Reboot),"Name: Isaac Francois Le Rothschild

Age: 25-26 (As of Kill la kill: I spit on your grave)

Born: January 24th, 1992, in Sedan, France

Occupation: Engineer (Graduated in Lyon, France and got postgrad degree in Technion in Haifa, Israel)

Story: Born in the Rothschild banking dynasty in France in the early 90s to a fully French mother and a German-Jewish banker father, Isaac lived a quiet small life in Sedan. When he was 16, his father taught him banking and gave him a job as a bank teller at the local family branch in Sedan until Isaac graduated and went to college. He went to Lyon, France and graduated after five years before resuming his postgraduate studied in Haifa, Israel. In Technion, the Israeli school he attended, the rise of Revocs corporation dominated the global market but the Rothschild family had their own tailors who made Isaac his own attire, which was mostly a formal suit, undershirt and tie, containing no life fibers. As Isaac attended Technion, he was unaware of what was going on in Japan by Ragyo Kiryuin and her plot to destroy the world with life fibers. He had a lot of money and no debt too, so he was able to attend a lot of extracurricular activities. He trained with IDF soldiers in hand-to-hand combat, and he also got to visit Jerusalem and pray at the western wall.

On that fateful day when Ragyo decided to release the covers, the life fiber outfit-shaped monsters across the world when she fought with Satsuki and Ryuko, the covers consumed most of Israel's population and Isaac was forced to hide and fight back. His entire school except for him and a few stragglers survived so he salvaged the plasma saw from Technion and engineered it into a weapon to use against the covers, which was the only thing that could defeat them in his experience. He also was able to engineer and produce plate armor with carbon nanotubes which were nearly as strong as life fibers for protection too. Throughout the attacks by the covers, Isaac was never involved with nudist beach, the anti-life fiber rebel organization but he fought hordes of covers alone. Cutting them down with his plasma saw. Nearing the end of Ragyo and Ryuko's battle, the great cover of the levant, a behemoth of life fibers fought with Isaac and he bravely fought and barely defeated it, saving his town. He was never praised publicly as a hero, but he was allowed to keep the plasma saw by his professor along with his carbon nanotube armor. Isaac graduated from Technion two years later in December 2017 (KLK takes place in late 2015) and left for Japan where he met Ryuko in a bad state.

This is my second post here in as many weeks. I just picked up a 2010 Versa (4-door hatch) for my teenage kids to share‚Äîbought it from a longtime family friend. On Monday, I gave it a quick look-over and handed over $1,000. Original owner. Full service records. Even had the infamous transmission replaced three years ago. I figured I knew what I was getting into, and it‚Äôs just $1,000.  I paid much more than that to replace the fuel pump last month on one of my aging German battle wagons.

I‚Äôve owned maybe 30 - 40 cars over the years. Didn‚Äôt even bother to test drive this one. If you‚Äôve ever been fucked over buying a car, you probably already know where this is headed.

Fast forward to today (Wednesday). I show up to drive it 300 miles back home. Something tells me to check the spare tire, jack, and tools in the trunk. I go to open the hatch‚Äîonly to find the mechanism is broken. And then it hits me: on Monday, the first thing the seller did was pop the hatch and show off the cargo area. It was like a flashback to 1986, when I bought a ‚Äò72 Coupe de Ville as a clueless 16-year-old. That car was parked in a circular driveway on a gentle slope. Took it for a drive, all seemed well. Bought it.  Next day? Fucking thing wouldn‚Äôt go into reverse.

Anyway‚Äîback to the Versa. I finally get the hatch open from the inside. I lift the floor to find the spare tire, jack, and lug wrench sitting in standing water. Surface rust everywhere. Motherfucker got me. And you know what they say: if you can‚Äôt fuck your friends and family, who can you fuck?

Now I‚Äôm sitting in a diner a mile away, drinking coffee, resisting the urge to drive this piece of shit straight into the side of the seller‚Äôs shiny new Corolla. I won‚Äôt do it‚Äîbut damn, the urge is strong.

Instead, I‚Äôm here turning to you all for some actual help. After all that backstory, can anyone offer guidance on where to start troubleshooting this kind of leak? Are there any known issues with water intrusion in the 2010 Versa hatchback? Any common failure points I should investigate?

Appreciate any insight you can share.  Thanks. ",1,1751506291.0,Nissan,5,0.67,False

I also think that the M.E.X.S.' mind is fnaf world. The map of fnaf world is a brain, which might be the M.E.X.S. brain. The M.E.X.S. program or F10-N4 is always trying to stop the M1 from escaping or killing people while also being a mom and a mimic. We know from fnaf world there is a mimic ability which copies the characters exact actions. The M.E.X.S. program has survived every fazbear event along with the mimic or M1. This means it has all of these characters stored in its head and has even more coming in with the new sister location animatronics being added as an ending (Babys eyes also look like the mimics eyes in fnaf world). There is also some never before seen animatronics like coffee and Mr.Chipper. The 8-bit figures are here too due to M.E.X.S. possibly hacking the arcade machines. I also think that Scott Cawthon is the real life equivalent to Edwin Murray and that is why animdude Edwin is trying to control the potential of M.E.X.S. just like Scott is trying to stop the player from winning. They both started creating rogue animatronics. I also think since F10-N4 is a mimic of Fiona it acts like a mother to protect the children. This is why Cassie is attacked by M.E.X.S. while wearing the Vanny mask, M.E.X.S. thinks Cassie will be like how Vanny was because she has her mask. The mask also has glitchtrap or William Afton's spirit inside of it since Vanny is Venessa and Vanessa got taken over by glitchtrap due to the Vanny mask. She is also trying to stop Cassie from getting to the mimic. I know this is a lot but if anything is wrong or if you need proof say so.",1,1751506062.0,GameTheorists,1,1.0,False
1lqd1mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lqd1mw/does_this_barista_like_me/,Does this barista like me?,"EDIT: Can someone please explain why I'm getting so many downvotes on this post? Honestly want to know so I can improve as a person.

Hi, so this is my first post like this - I‚Äôm really confused whether this girl likes me or thinks I‚Äôm a creep and I need advice.

Requires a little background about myself: I work fully remotely since Covid, and I find I‚Äôm most productive when I spend the day at a coffee shop.

I‚Äôm also a 6‚Äô3‚Äù man (29) and have dated a lot of girls. But I‚Äôm on the introverted/overthinking side by nature. Hence why I write for a living.

Anyway: ever since I started going to this one coffee shop to work each day, this one barista who‚Äôs really cute always gets super quiet and just stares at me when she takes my order and kinda stiffens up. But when I‚Äôm not near her, I notice she‚Äôs always laughing with her female co-workers and smiles politely taking others‚Äô orders.

One time we walked by each other outside and she turned and smiled at me. Another time I went to get coffee, and she saw me and walked into the back room with her co-worker. I could see she was staring at me while they were talking. (That same co-worker smiles at me and has a flirty tone when she says ‚ÄúHey‚Äù taking my order.)

Another time I asked her for a refill on coffee, and she handed it almost overfilled to me and it spilled. I thought she did it on purpose so I (think) said sarcastically, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my fault, sorry.‚Äù And she just kind of quietly said, it‚Äôs okay.

Like an hour before that the same day, I ordered buffalo wings from UberEats. They got my order wrong and I asked all the other baristas if they wanted it, but they all declined politely. I waved her over last when I saw her, and she kinda ran over smiling, and immediately said yes when I offered it to her. But she didn‚Äôt say thanks.

Today she was there on her off day and when I walked in from a work call, we made eye contact and she immediately looked down at her lap. A little later today I went back outside to get an UberEats order when she was vaping/talking with her co-worker, and I noticed her turn her head to look at me when I walked by.

I want to add that I‚Äôm not a creep. I don‚Äôt go to this coffee shop to stare at girls. I regularly get girls‚Äô numbers when I feel like it. I go to this coffee shop because it‚Äôs well-priced, popular, and conducive to productivity for remote writing work.

I do find this girl really cute though (we both have green eyes, and she‚Äôs shortish, which I really like. But I want advice about whether that attraction is reciprocated based on the above experiences. I don‚Äôt want to be seen as a creepy stalker dude.

I was just called this afternoon and asked to go in at 8:00 (even though I have to be at my next job by 9am) I said yes of course and got myself all ready, which included a huge extra strong cup of coffee around 6p.m. well, things got messed up tonight and as I was on my way to the new job, a manager told me they didn't have anyone to train me.. I hopped off of the bus and started walking home in the 90¬∞ heat.. 30 minutes later, just as I'm getting home, the owner called and said the manager didn't know what she was talking about and he thinks she was annoyed that he was bringing someone new in on her shift. 

I don't need the drama and I was drenched in sweat by the time I got home, plus the buses are running every hour now üòû

Went on first date from 6 to 9pm. No food!,"I met a guy (34, I‚Äôm 30) for a first date over coffee and while the conversation was decent, something just felt off. He kept asking intense questions about how I make decisions - like how I chose between the three coffee shops, if I‚Äôm indecisive, how I approach choices in general. It felt more like I was being analyzed than just getting to know someone.

He was also super frugal. He said so himself. We talked for about 2.5 hours, didn‚Äôt get any food (I was starving), and when I didn‚Äôt want to keep sitting on a random bench, he didn‚Äôt suggest grabbing a bite or even finding a bar or somewhere more comfortable. I‚Äôm not even sure if he ate at all.

He said he‚Äôd like to meet again but I‚Äôm unsure. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just being picky or if this was genuinely kind of weird.

Also the meeting time and the location were super vague until the last minute. He seemed to not really be a decisive guy even though in person he said he was. Like he didn‚Äôt ask me what I wanted to eat - and he didn‚Äôt say we should keep talking in a bar. He wanted to keep sitting outside on a bench after 8:30 lol. ",1,1751505824.0,Advice,10,0.67,False

I‚Äôm looking to connect with someone who‚Äôs consistent, witty, and maybe just as sarcastic as I am. Someone who values connection over chaos, and isn't afraid to be real. Whether it‚Äôs a fun chat that turns into a friendship, or something that builds naturally over time‚ÄîI‚Äôm open to seeing where things go.
