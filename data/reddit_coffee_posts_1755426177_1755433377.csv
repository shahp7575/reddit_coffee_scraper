1msph0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1msph0u/the_most_emotional_powerful_and_realistic_dream_i/,"The most emotional, powerful, and realistic dream I can remember (long post warning)","Good morning everyone, this is my first time posting in this sub. 

This morning, about an hour ago, I awoke in tears after experiencing the most emotionally powerful, and realistic dream I can ever remember having. 

I am currently sitting at my kitchen island drinking coffee, and have been struggling to emotionally process the dream. I came across this sub, and figured it might be helpful to write out what I remember, and share it here‚Ä¶I guess with the thought that there may be some folks here who have experienced similar dreams. 

This past spring, my grandfather passed away after a few years with Alzheimer‚Äôs. Anyone who has had a loved one go through this, knows how horrible and painful it is to see. We knew his passing was coming, and after his quality of life began to sharply decline over the last couple years, it was almost a relief. 

I‚Äôve always said, before he passed as well as after, that he was a man I aspired to be like. 
I suspect that my feelings towards him as a man I looked up to, are relevant when thinking about the dream.

He was a loving husband and father. He was an incredibly kind and loving grandfather, who made sure he always had an active and supportive role in the lives of his grandchildren.

He was an absolute goof, a prankster, something he learned from his father. 

(Quick example- when my great-grandfather was in a nursing home, he and my grandfather bought fake dog poop. They would keep it in my great grandpas dresser drawer at the home. 

Every once in a while, they would put it on the floor, and then start yelling for a nurse. The nurses would come rushing in to find this dog poop on the floor of the room, while my great grandpa and grandfather would be yelling about how some smelly dog just came into the room, pooped, and ran off. 

The nurses would frantically start to look around for a random dog, before finally my grandfather would pick it up and say, ‚Äúoh, I guess it‚Äôs fake poop! Sorry!‚Äù) 

Anyway, he obviously made a big impact on my life. He always made sure to spend one-on-one time with each of his grandkids, forming a special and individual bond with every one of us. 

When I was growing into my teens, as an energetic boy with undiagnosed ADHD, I began to struggle more in school. This led to me starting to rebel, as well as finding myself getting in trouble more often. Drinking, smoking, partying, etc‚Ä¶

My parents were worried about me. They went to a therapist, as did I. But my grandfather always believed in me. I remember many long talks at his kitchen table, where I learned how similar we were. He struggled with academics and getting into trouble as well. 

He would always look directly into my eyes, with a firm but deeply sincere look, and say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to be just fine‚Äù.  

Whenever we said goodbye, he would tell me he loved me..then would get a big smile, firmly grab my shoulder, and say, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt be stupid!‚Äù. 

So that‚Äôs just a little about my grandfather, perhaps as context, or maybe it just makes me feel better to type all of that out..either way, onto the dream- 

It took place at my parents house, where I grew up, in our living room. There was family over, it might have been a holiday or birthday, I couldn‚Äôt tell for sure. 

Also there were some members of my wife‚Äôs family, specifically her Uncle Paul, who has only ever met my family on our wedding day. Sadly, my grandfathers condition was too severe at that point to be there. 

Also there, was one of my wife‚Äôs best friends, Cass, of whom we had just taken a day trip to visit yesterday. 

We were all (unfortunately) discussing politics‚Ä¶I am not sure what I said, but my wife‚Äôs friend  responded with some sort of compliment or affirmation towards me, because I then said, ‚Äúthanks Cass for hyping me up! You and Emily (my wife‚Äôs other best friend- I adore both of them) are always good at hyping me up!‚Äù  - This might not be the exact words, but it was close to it. 

My wife‚Äôs uncle then said something about a certain politician being a jerk, and as I was agreeing and talking to him, a familiar voice said something like, ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs a jerk, they‚Äôre all jerks, we always have to pick from jerks‚Äù. 

I turned, and it was my grandfather, sitting in a chair right next to me. I remember being shocked in the dream..like I legitimately remember myself looking at him, mouth agape, in disbelief. He looked younger and healthy, probably like he did when I was maybe a teen. 

I put my hand on his shoulder, and remember being able to physically feel him there. Like I can‚Äôt even explain it, but It was so real. 

In absolute shock, I just said something like, ‚Äúgrandpa, where have you been??‚Äù or ‚Äúgrandpa, how did you get here?‚Äù.

He smiled and pointed at something in the room, maybe a shelf or table, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been right here, right where your mom put me!‚Äù.

In the dream, I burst into sobbing, and woke not long after to find myself still sobbing. It took me a bit to even settle myself. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbad dream‚Äù, or anything like that. It was pretty normal feeling. 

In fact, the moment I saw my grandfather sitting next to me, and felt his shoulder in my hand, I was overwhelmed with feelings that I can‚Äôt really describe..maybe Joy, gratitude, or simply just disbelief. But they weren‚Äôt feelings of sadness, despair, or grief.

My grandfather was cremated, and my mother has the ashes in an urn at home, so I guess maybe that was the meaning behind what he said‚Ä¶

For a little more context, the other people I spoke to in the dream (my wife‚Äôs uncle and friend), are people I find to be truly caring, kind, and comfortable to be around. 

I generally am not one to sit and analyze the meaning behind my dreams. I am not religious in the traditional, institutional sense. I consider myself agnostic. But I do believe that people can have strong spiritual connections on deeper levels than they have with others. 

I guess writing this out and expressing my emotions is a way of analyzing as well as processing. I feel a lot better already by this point. 

I am not sure if anyone here has had any similar experiences. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this. But if this resonates with you, or you‚Äôve had something similar happen, feel free to share your thoughts. 

Thanks for being here if you‚Äôve read this far, and I hope all of you have a good Sunday üíö

#Alien Nation, Book Two, Chapter Two: Meet the New Boss

*****

###Mental Map

Natalie‚Äôs initial impression from the air left her disappointed, but once we‚Äôd settled down into the complex, she‚Äôd been like a kid in a playground. Pushing around the perfectly balanced giant artillery guns had put a huge grin on her face. We‚Äôd gotten a few shots of me jumping atop the barrel and balancing atop it, practicing parkour scrabbling up the cement bunkers. The weirdest part was doing the video as if she wasn‚Äôt right around the corner. We‚Äôd only stopped when she‚Äôd seen the maintenance machinery tripped over the leg of a misplaced stool in her haste to explore and faceplanted.

A quick trip back to the family car while her cut was assessed gave me the breathing room I needed to check the town and time. I‚Äôd have to hurry.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alright?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúShe will be,‚Äù Morsh confirmed. ‚ÄúBut I think we should call it quits.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think we have enough footage?‚Äù I asked. Morsh‚Äôs inscrutable expression didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúI should get her looked at.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I agreed. ‚ÄúNatalie, are you alright to go with Morsh?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yeah,‚Äù Natalie said, looking at where she‚Äôd skinned herself and then up at me.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said, taking my bike out of the trunk. ‚ÄúYou two should get going, then. I‚Äôve got some time to flesh out the last of the script I have for this place. And hey, for once, it‚Äôll be real. You won‚Äôt be next to me this time. I‚Äôll do the rest of the recording, ship it off, and then we can meet tomorrow?‚Äù

She looked like she was going to object right up until I suggested tomorrow.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Morsh finally put her foot down, arms crossed in a way that suggested she was deeply unimpressed by my independent streak.

Boys on Shil‚Äôvati worlds didn‚Äôt just go off on their own, after all.

The typical Shil‚Äôvati Marine resembled little so much as a female orc someone had carefully and meticulously groomed until she was undeniably female, and then stuffed into a 1960‚Äôs idea of a futuristic military jumpsuit. The form-fitting uniforms left distractingly little to imagine of their tall, well-muscled, slender bodies. I‚Äôd also seen one easily lift a grown man with one arm and max out a weight machine, so I knew better than to think the appearance of those muscles merely cosmetic. And as was apparently usual for the broader galaxy, Shil‚Äôvati women were the predominant species both in number and martial preeminence. And even among them, Morsh was quite a specimen of lethality. There was doubtless a good reason the Noble Rakten family felt comfortable with a Militia of just one, when the Fleet‚Äôs restriction-of-force policy limited Noble Militia, but not *that* severely.

Earth was something of a complete outlier to them. They found us amusing, right up until things like *this* happened.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, tapping the embossed, and then stamped pass I‚Äôd stuck in a laminated lanyard that dangled around my neck. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll be alright.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt Delaware, kid. Emperor doesn‚Äôt run the insurgency here.‚Äù As far as either of us was *supposed* to be aware, that was true. Sure, everyone suspected Emperor as the one responsible for the surrounding states‚Äô rising insurgent activity, but so far no one could prove a direct link rather than insurgents being inspired by my victories.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, no one even knows I‚Äôm here,‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be careful, and on my bike.‚Äù

Natalie let out a hiss as she stretched her knee again and Morsh finally relented with a disapproving grumble. ‚ÄúYou check in, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúPromise,‚Äù I almost instinctively did the insurgent salute before changing it to a couple fingers tapping my chest. ‚ÄúCross my heart and hope to die.‚Äù

She stared at me for a few seconds. ‚ÄúNataliska‚Äôs right. You humans have the strangest phrases.‚Äù

And then they were gone, the Rakten family flying sedan arcing through the sky.

*****

My meeting with George had been frustratingly illuminating. Taking my bike from the park had been over Morsh‚Äôs objections- but with a pass in hand, who was she to say otherwise? I rode from the western-northern tip of New Jersey via the Hudson Trail all the way to Freehold, my mind buzzing with questions.

The volume of knowledge he held was immense, but the gaps were troubling.

He understood the losses were high. I could show him the numbers I was getting, that losses were higher than recruits. That much was obvious. It was the ‚Äòwhy,‚Äô where he was lost- and he hadn‚Äôt even been able to formulate and organize his thoughts to ask the questions well enough.

*Why* were losses here higher? Were the enemy reinforcing faster via some methodology? If so, was that something the others would have to look out for? What was the Reinforcement Time (RT) After First Moment of Engagement (AFME)? Were they utilizing newer technology, like observational overhead drones? Were the jamming fields not working anymore? Were fire teams not adequately following our instructions on how to conduct an ambush?

Maybe he‚Äôd tried to run before he could walk, and had forgotten the way that we‚Äôd those things. It had all been by painful experimentation.

I parted with a reminder that New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, all were different to Delaware. We had to basically start over. George‚Äôs top lieutenant kept staring at me, but stayed silent in the background, observing, providing details only when prompted by George.

I‚Äôd had to leave him with these mysteries to solve. All I could do was advise ways to try and suss them out before I was due home, leaving me to wonder where and how things had gone wrong, and whether I‚Äôd have actually done any better in his place.

Supposedly Maryland had seen an adaptation where a physical data cable now ran from their bodysuit up to the helmet. It didn‚Äôt restore their comms or coordination from the Data Team satellites, but it did at least allow their targeting system to function. When that was coupled to the thermal sensors located in their helmets, it made engagements far more lethal, and ambushes far more difficult. Firing from the chest and hip was no longer anything like firing blindly since the reticle on their visors worked again. Was that what was happening? George didn‚Äôt know.

Were the cells being rooted out due to loyalist entrenchment? A bunch of new faces arriving in town with insufficient backstories? Was our method of inserting cells not working? Were the connections hastily made in jail cells too tenuous to be the basis of much? Had they been under observation in those cells, accidentally confirming to the shil‚Äôvati? Were the compromised individuals somehow catalogued and flagged for retrieval the moment they were spotted over the border?

All these questions were met with that same frustrating: *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù*

More irritating was that I could tell from under that mask just how frustrated *he* was. It wasn‚Äôt that George didn‚Äôt care to know or was fundamentally incurious. And even I was unsure as to how to tackle these problems. He‚Äôd made further advancements in the railgun designs, and even demonstrated a slingshot-like forearm brace for the ‚Äòwristbreaker,‚Äô railgun pistols. Excellent work, but what good were they if we weren‚Äôt gaining ground? We‚Äôd started in Delaware with less and made more progress.

Even the extra time of the train ride to Jamesburg, and from there to Monmouth Junction and the final connector home hadn‚Äôt exactly given me many answers. What few I had, I wrote down in a notebook. While I trusted Natalie‚Äôs omni-pad to deliver me the map instructions to deliver me a route to meet with George, it felt like a betrayal of her trust to start using the omni-pad she‚Äôd given me to lay more effective plans to kill her people. I was aware it was a paper-thin moralism with no practical difference, but there was just something about using it that way that felt *wrong.*

The last light had faded, leaving me staring at my own reflection, the occasional headlights or rare streetlight winking out at me. At last, we pulled into one of the new stations, a rather simple affair built fast and cheap. A crushed stone surface for people to stand on, a simple slanted roof under a couple steel beams, and a low platform. ADA considerations had gone out the window with prosthetics, though I could see the construction machinery nearby, a more permanent structure already underway.

I glanced back down at my notebook, trying to rally my concentration back to the task at hand.

I considered the other fronts, looking at the figures I‚Äôd scribbled down there.

New York City was proceeding well. Pennsylvania was struggling under Radio‚Äôs leadership, something about there being *too many people* to operate without loyalist eyes on them to spoil ambushes, as well as dedicated and surprisingly active loyalist cells. Maryland, despite receiving the lowest aid, was developing nicely under the CIA‚Äôs auspices and their chosen Lieutenant, whose name I wasn‚Äôt even able to recall immediately.

They had even given me good intel, but it grated at me that I‚Äôd had to rely on the CIA to get it. How many revolutionaries had been deposed by the CIA the moment the two didn‚Äôt see eye-to-eye? Did I really trust Gavin and Sullivan? Certainly, with the bulk of our funding as they relocated and opened new manufacturing plants in Delaware. I trusted them with training up new recruits.

They‚Äôd proven themselves‚Ä¶but only so far. This sense would not go away, even as dozens of railguns rolled off assembly lines. Even if I couldn‚Äôt have done what we‚Äôd accomplished without their notes in the first place, their help via Miskatonic and other research groups passing us notes, taking feedback, and coordinating black market buyers on the other end of many of Sam‚Äôs deals.

Even though they‚Äôd been there almost since the start, I still regarded them as something ‚Äòtacked on‚Äô to our rebellion, rather than a genuine part of the Inner Circle. Maybe I didn‚Äôt want to replace Larry and Verns, undeniably good men, with a pair of snakes.

Or maybe I was reluctant to let go of Larry‚Äôs advice: *Always trust your gut over what someone else tells you. Other people can have all kinds of interests, but your gut‚Äôs always going to be in your corner.*

*****

#Meet the New Boss

The morning brought not only the long-expected arrival, but yet another vid-message.

Still going through her morning routine, the state of Delaware‚Äôs acting Governess-General put the video message on autoplay, noting that it was from the usual group of noblewomen still furious that Amilita hadn‚Äôt levelled the state the moment the last of the hostages had been set free.

She‚Äôd all but memorized the main talking points by now: *Do you know what kind of example this sets? What sort of General are you, one who raises her lips over her tusks when the enemy is a man? If you don‚Äôt act on this immediately then I‚Äôll have you replaced. You‚Äôll be rubberstamping marriage proposals with Bal‚Äôshir on Alpha Centauri before you know it,- oh wait, you‚Äôre not even a noblewoman. Your career, over! Your life, over! Do you get it yet? Order your Marines-*

Amilita had long since stopped bothering with a reply anymore, only listening to it in full out of her sense of duty.

The follow up messages had all landed faster than her responses could have reached possibly the nobles‚Äô desk, each always bellowing outrage over whatever new detail of the peace that had come to light.

That no orders from either the Planetary Governess or the Fleet Admiral to rip up the truce for all the months they‚Äôd had to make up their minds said either this was all talk, or she had their tacit approval, or at least the situation was so odorous that they feared any direct involvement equated to career suicide.

It was a strange form of job security.

She spat out her morning oral cleansing routine into the faucet- a genuine, clay ‚Äòporcelain‚Äô fixture with shiny ornate brass handles, polished until they shone in a gold-like hue.

A General was still furnished with the same kit as any other Marine Officer, the presumption doubtless being that a noble officer would see to her own needs, with the kit there to round out anything that might be hard to come across on a tour of duty. Amilita was no noblewoman, though her entire office and quarters certainly didn‚Äôt reflect that.

Despite cashing no favors nor being a noblewoman, her office was now furnished far more finely than either Generals Zylkyn or Azraea‚Äôs had ever been.

Fine, handcrafted dense-wooden shil‚Äôvati Marine figurines depicted her standing in an imposing, but heroic manner. Careful brush strokes with crushed powders given water in her own likeness delivered unbidden. Pots of a strange texture and rustic colored clay were glazed and ‚Äòfired‚Äô- some of the largest depicting stories via stylized pictographs. Stone busts of her own face carved from beautiful, rough rock were given with almost every visit and photo-op.

One would fairly judge her an egotist if she‚Äôd ever asked for any of these, and yet it was fear of being rude in refusing a gift, any gift, that made her keep them. Eventually, around the fifth portrait, she‚Äôd started boxing them up and shipping them offworld to try and sate the galaxy‚Äôs endless appetite for *anything* Earth, and putting the spare credits away for the bribes she‚Äôd certainly need someday just to get favors done.

There was one human handicraft that she kept on the corner of her desk, one she‚Äôd never get rid of. A little stuffed teddy bear, handed back to her by a human boy. It came with a letter written in childish, blocky lettering as he attempted to hand-write High Shil from a hospital bed: *I heard you had a week full of misfortune. This was supposed to make me feel better, but nothing worked as much as knowing you came for me when I was in trouble. If you need anything, let me know.*

*-Elias Sampson*

And hadn‚Äôt *that* kicked off a whole tempest of emotion. Her own junior officer had later kidnapped and savaged the boy, and here he was *thanking her* for coming running to save him from her own failure as a leader, even as she had within the day found herself wielding undreamed of amounts of power. Only Elias could have seen that and still offered her comfort.

She took her eyes off the bear and back to her omni-pad‚Äôs screen, checking for any other messages delivered, and wondered again about whether she should have someone from the Data Teams or Fleet screen her messages.

Her son‚Äôs message sat right beneath the announcement, but she didn‚Äôt have the time to see it. Not when she had last-second inspections to run through, if it was what she thought it was.

Her ad-hoc, temporary reign as Governess-General had been extended by the remarkable fact that at *least* the next three Governesses, all nobles of System Lady rank, had declined the appointment they‚Äôd earlier signed up for. It seemed that as much as they‚Äôd paid to be so high up in the queue, each would rather lose a little face and be out the unsecured deposit on the bribe than face the fates of the last three hapless Governesses.

*Dead & discredited, Dismissed in shame, and Dead & defeated‚Ä¶*

Amilita could only hope her smooth, so far incident-free tenure had hopefully convinced a brave noblewoman to find the courage to accept the posting she‚Äôd paid good bribe money to be considered for, rather than a desperate one. The scant information she‚Äôd gotten of the impending arrival didn‚Äôt indicate much, and now she knew she was out of time.

The ship that had delivered this message *also* carried an alert, marked high-priority to her and several others of significant rank and station- Planetary Governess, Regional Command, the Data Teams, and Fleet.

Based on the addresses, she‚Äôd known what it was without looking- the new Governess had finally arrived.

*****

The new Governess certainly knew how to make an entrance. Special dispensation for a militia force over two hundred strong, plus a whole host of equipment. Her own building, even, was already being unloaded by a bulk freight hauler. The Sol system by now had its own rudimentary facilities, but it seemed she wanted the point to really stick.

Militia were still inspecting the base, and the first returned to give a preliminary ‚Äòall-clear,‚Äô to the shuttle captain to finish the descent. They were all dressed in kit far too close to true frontline equipment for Amilita‚Äôs liking, rather than the somewhat dated stuff the exploratory fleet was given.

Notably, their equipment and cohesion of movement was at least as good as a Marine‚Äôs, and they looked well-disciplined. Doubtless the cream of the crop of the Lady‚Äôs home system. The armed shuttle‚Äôs slow descent was making a point, and Amilita knew she had no choice but to stand in formation, waiting.

Amilita‚Äôs dignity demanded she walk inside and tell the troops to break until it was finished, but she had no choice but to stand there like an idiot. She was being tested.

Finally, the armed, private shuttle settled down on its landing pads with a whirr-hiss of hydraulics. The whole bottom dropped out with a fresh phalanx of Militia, their armor especially sleek and deadly.

‚ÄúLady Cre‚Äôsin,‚Äù Amilita greeted with a slight dip in the knees, as was custom. The noblewoman did not return the gesture, instead surveying the Marines milling about the base beyond the honor guard, and striding forward.

The General turned on her heel and took the lead toward the hangar, ignoring the subtle way the bodyguards shifted their positions and sharpened up. *If they try anything, there‚Äôs a few thousand soldiers here who might have something to say about it.*

Soldiers parted for the two as they entered the human hangar, some snapping to attention, others with hands full carrying on their duties but clearly making a note, even as her militia formed a flank, staring down every Marine that dared cast a glance their way.

*****

The first several minutes had gone surprisingly well. The new Governess, Lady Cre‚Äôsin, struck Amilita as the bookish sort, if she peeled the layers away to her academy years she could see her as a young girl, eager to show she wasn‚Äôt to be taken lightly, yet obviously still nervous. Amilita had used that to the maximum advantage, suggesting the two go up together to get a ‚Äòbird‚Äôs eye view.‚Äô Before the Governess could balk or her Militia could step in to interfere, the General had whisked her colleague away in a smuggler‚Äôs impounded luxury hovercar.

‚ÄúAnd this zone is still‚Ä¶?‚Äù Cre‚Äôsin asked, her eyes still on the transparent floor, as if expecting a smoke trail to emerge from the marshes, rushing up to meet their slowly circling craft.

Amilita at last realized what the early show of force was all about. Only extensive time around her friend, Lady Rakten, had given her the insight to sense that the noblewoman was petrified- so afraid she didn‚Äôt even dare show a hint of it. Nobles underwent training, practically bred from birth to not show their own true emotions.

How best to give reassurances without coming across as foolish or insincere?

Amilita mentally reviewed the file she‚Äôd read on her new colleague. It really said something about how far the assignment had fallen that Amilita had to have Senior Data Officer Borzun look up her name. Perhaps some of those who had put in their bribes had started specifying which zone, or what color of zone, because Amilita found it hard to believe such an otherwise unnoteworthy noblewoman was just fourth in line of all applicants.

*About five years my senior. Bought out the last two years of her service contract in the Navy to take over her house, but at least did attend basic. No commendations, no reprimands- no hallmarks of a purged record, either. Just unremarkable service in a time of peace.*

‚ÄúAccording to some in the fleet, ma‚Äôam, yes, it‚Äôs still red.‚Äù That had been a not-so-subtle way for the fleet to tell her exactly what they thought of the settlement, without outright ordering her to do anything. She *needed* the Governess on-board before she chose to try something foolish. ‚ÄúBut by the numbers we‚Äôre supposed to use for casualties, attacks, and so on? It‚Äôs the greenest zone on the planet.‚Äù

She‚Äôd checked the news reports her friend had gathered in the short notice they‚Äôd had, pulling whatever archives arrived in-system from ships that hailed from that sector of the Empire. The Data Diver had to expand her search for any mention of that System. By all accounts, it was an unremarkable system on a near-edge world that had a reasonable population, a decent amount of resources but nothing remarkable enough to warrant heavy, hyper-rapid investment on the scale Earth received.

Amilita tapped her tusk and wondered for the first time whether that ever engendered any kind of envy among the backwater Marines, before continuing on. *No indictments from the Interior, a clean record. Minor complaints from Cre‚Äôsin‚Äôs homeworld on levies issued for militia and other expenditures, but the family‚Äôs not known for being overly showy‚Ä¶either that or they just don‚Äôt have much and the selection fell all the way down to her.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be rude, but is this really the case? Or is it‚Ä¶?‚Äù She was polite, at least.

‚ÄúMy Data Teams are top notch, ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôve stressed to them the value of honesty in reporting.‚Äù She managed a humorless smile. ‚ÄúIt drives my Liaison Officer, Lieutenant Ryiannah, crazy.‚Äù

Paddling around the base‚Äôs inner perimeter was going well so far, so Amilita took the car up a bit higher and then started pointing out features, namely the most positive ones. The Governess pointed at the canal, but before she could say anything, her passenger leaned forward.

‚ÄúThere. That‚Äôs the new spaceport under construction, isn‚Äôt it?""

‚ÄúSaint Georges will become a transportation hub. It connects with highways, a canal connecting two major bays, and a railroad. Perfect for moving freight, people, goods. You name it. Wilmington‚Äôs is undergoing a considerable amount of analysis, as there was a great degree of toxic waste dumped in its landfill at the proposed site. Once the landfill is done being excavated en masse and stabilized, construction will begin in earnest.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as big as‚Ä¶‚Äù she stopped herself from whatever she was going to say, then her eyes strayed from Amilita‚Äôs finger, pointing past the ruins of Pea Patch Island, toward where the giant concrete piers were being reconnected by hovering ships dragging enormous neosteel cables into duracrete. Amilita answered before the new Governess could even ask. ‚ÄúThe new bridge is still under construction- it should be done in about a week. I apologize that it wasn‚Äôt finished in time.‚Äù In truth, it might be good for her to attend its reopening.

‚ÄúWhat happened to it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe battle,‚Äù Amilita waved a hand, and it felt strange to treat it as if it was old news to be dismissed, but to calm her down she had to talk about the reconstruction, not the destruction. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only a little bit behind schedule.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asking for appraisals since my backlogged appointment was fulfilled. I was told the situation is quite different to what it was I was informed of at the time I applied. Now you tell me that the situation is different even to those appraisals.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich do you trust most?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the car with me, so at least if you‚Äôre wrong, we both die.‚Äù

At least she‚Äôd stopped staring straight at the ground in expectance of catching a glimpse of their shared onrushing doom before they erupted in a giant fireball crashing down to this alien planet they found themselves posted on.

‚ÄúOf course, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Amilita changed tack. ‚ÄúThis is often the case for Earth. Briefings don‚Äôt even begin to cover the complexity of matters. What is essential for you to understand at this stage is: The danger is over.‚Äù

The noblewoman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt even flicker in surprise, Amilita had to credit her that. ‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù She asked, but Amilita had spent enough time around noblewomen to know when she‚Äôd thrown one off.

‚ÄúThere have been no attacks in over a month now. Zero casualties. Patrols are now operating in Flexi-Fiber suits, carrying their charge packs at their hips instead of loaded. We have stepped down our force and equipment requirements, and allowed ourselves to be de-prioritized for reinforcements. One of the only zones to do so, I suspect.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. The peace agreement you brokered. I may have heard about it, once or twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs working,‚Äù Amilita didn‚Äôt bite the bait. ‚ÄúThe damage to the city has been cleaned up. You saw the off-base starports, which will function to keep growing opportunities for the humans here. There‚Äôs an arts *partnership* program, even.‚Äù

‚ÄúTruly? That is encouraging,‚Äù Cre‚Äôsin was starting to actually have a little hope, letting it creep into her voice despite her training. ‚ÄúWhat is the name of this program?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were going to call it *‚ÄòArtisanship, Not Partisanship,‚Äô* until it tested poorly.‚Äù Best to not mention that Emperor himself had shot it down. Rhymes featured so heavily in their poetry and other forms of art, and it had been meant favorably. They seemed very particular about their rhymes, for no good reason that Amilita could tell. Or was he just still committed to remaining an active partisan enemy? It maddened her to not know.

‚ÄúThe Interior is decidedly unhappy about the state of affairs. They want me to order you to kill the agreement, and to ambush him when you can.‚Äù She was freely offering information. This had to be going well.

Amilita smiled despite the knot in her stomach that had nothing to do with skipping breakfast or the altitude. ‚ÄúI see, and if you ask me to do that, then I‚Äôm going to advise against doing so.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we try, your state will immediately become red again,‚Äù Amilita promised. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid those are the terms of the peace we enjoy here. Simply put, I doubt that we could muster enough resources, even if we committed fully to anything except wholesale slaughter, and you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find a Marine willing to do that. When it all goes wrong, you and I will be blamed for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Marines aren‚Äôt willing to fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently it was difficult enough for Azraea to call down an orbital strike, she had to rely on her most trusted Captain, Sukodi, to ensure she‚Äôd follow the order. There‚Äôs no shortage of hurt and antipathy on both sides, but most would refuse such an order. They‚Äôve both worked hard to keep incidents from happening. Frankly, also, I doubt the Interior cares half as much about what happens to either of us, or the peace here, or even the humans of Delaware. They have their objectives, but let‚Äôs not have them lead us into our own undoing.‚Äù

The new Governess spent a moment in silence. ‚ÄúIt would be a shame to see this all on fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay, you‚Äôre here alone, are you not? And you have a family? Why did you not use your post to send for them?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was never certain how long my post would be,‚Äù Amilita admitted. ‚ÄúBetter to not send for them until I feel secure in my post, or else they‚Äôd arrive just in time to see me be dismissed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come now, General Amilita, if the situation here is as secure as you say, then there should be no problem. Besides, things here may be more stable than they are out there.‚Äù

Amilita swallowed. ‚ÄúOf course, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù *What did she mean by that?*

‚ÄúIn fact, I‚Äôll draft their papers right now for you, a pass. Call it a Governess‚Äôs friendly priority. I will need you to show me how it‚Äôs done. You say the deal is between the Emperor and the Governess, correct? Or would it be between the Emperor and the General? Or Emperor and you?‚Äù

She saw the play now. The new Governess was asking: *Who has the authority, here? Was it her state, after all? Or had the General conspired with Emperor to manage some sort of coup?* It was also a way to force her to put her family equally on the line- if this state was truly as safe as she said, then surely there‚Äôd be no objection. An absolute master stroke of diplomacy, all in one little move, and she could muster no objection to it. ‚ÄúThe Governess, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù she supplied without protest.

‚ÄúWonderful. So if we have to renegotiate anything, it would be through me, as well?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd advise my own attendance,‚Äù Amilita cautioned.

‚ÄúYour attendance as General, or your attendance as yourself?‚Äù Was she fishing for whether a salacious rumor held any merit?

In fact, Amilita simply had no illusions about her chances in anything less than a direct conflict engagement after the election results had come in. With railguns now a factor, even that was no longer the absolute certainty it once was, barring mass use of orbitals, which she didn‚Äôt have the authority to call in.

Amilita held her head high despite the affront to her honor. ‚ÄúBoth. I have insights into the nature of humanity gained through my time serving here as an Officer. And when Emperor learned that Azraea was going to reject his offer of trading the marines, he chose to approach me to trade for Myrrah via Masarie, plus a few others before we were ordered to stop. He said at the time that my mercy during the war- the liberation, indicated I could be trusted. Humanity does not base negotiations entirely on one‚Äôs station or rank, it is built up with people over time.‚Äù

‚ÄúRather like the Coalition.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the first to make the comparison, but it‚Äôs circumstantial. The rank of a rotten organization, to their mind, is meaningless. A particularly rotten individual within a good organization, similarly, does not engender trust, either.‚Äù

The Governess considered this for a moment. ‚ÄúI suppose my comparison was somewhat unfair. I meant no disrespect.‚Äù Somehow, she‚Äôd picked up on Amilita‚Äôs discomfort. ‚ÄúThey say Earth is a strange place. You have studied them. Would you say our Data Teams are incorrect?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think their time being spent entirely in space is unhelpful. I‚Äôve requested a rotating number of day passes for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were forbidden from a few towns and a couple forests. I put those areas under immediate intense scrutiny.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you find in those areas?‚Äù

She fought from pounding the instrument cluster display in frustration. ‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sound adversarial toward him,‚Äù she remarked, surprised.

‚ÄúYou could say that.‚Äù If ever Amilita was alone in a room with him and were there no consequences she had no doubt she‚Äôd throttle him! For all he‚Äôd done, for all the chaos and suffering he‚Äôd caused.

‚ÄúMeetings are one-on-one?‚Äù Amilita gave a nod. ‚ÄúA contradiction, then, if you advise your own attendance.‚Äù

The General only smiled. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs actually something I‚Äôd like to show you, ma‚Äôam. I feel this talk isn‚Äôt getting across the‚Ä¶idea. Would you please come with me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù Asked the Governess, stiffening in place.

‚ÄúLunch,‚Äù she said, moving down the tarmac and bringing the Governess in her wake. ‚ÄúMy treat.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, where?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúOff base. Come on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy things are still being unloaded, shouldn‚Äôt we supervise? My shuttle has a cafe.‚Äù She glanced over her shoulder as Amilita took the luxury car over the garrison perimeter toward *Charcoal Pit.*

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you curious, Governess? Your new state awaits you. There‚Äôs amazing cuisine and sights.‚Äù As the Governess searched for words, Amilita put the accelerator further as it shot across the sky. ‚ÄúI promise you, Earth is everything you hope for and more.‚Äù Amilita saw fear and greed war it out for a moment, before she accepted her colleague‚Äôs dare.

******

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure this is safe?‚Äù Cre‚Äôsin asked for the dozenth time, eyes scanning for bodyguards and conflicted that there were none present, then touching her pass, ensuring it wasn‚Äôt blocked by anything and was prominent.

Amilita realized what she‚Äôd hoped might feel liberating for the noblewoman could instead feel like a child‚Äôs first time in the deep end.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve left the base a dozen times in an officer‚Äôs car, and made the rounds between D.C. and here pretty regularly. No target locks have been detected within Delaware in over two months.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt need to mention most of those target lock alerts used to start before she‚Äôd even cleared the base perimeter, occasional potshots pinging off the hull as people tried their luck. The noise had a distinctive note she could recall perfectly, despite the passage of time.

The Governess clearly filed away that information and tried to recalculate her idea of ‚Äòacceptable risk threshold.‚Äô

‚ÄúWe receive a high number of visitor requests for the experience we‚Äôre about to get.‚Äù She gestured back at where they‚Äôd left the car, centered in the parking spot- something else humans were surprisingly particular about.

‚ÄúTwo months?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt used to be so many times a day that we stopped counting,‚Äù she added for clarity, in case she decided to examine why there‚Äôd been a supposed sudden dropoff during Azraea‚Äôs tenure, to double-check what Amilita was now telling her.

Ten minutes later, and the Governess was in a diner booth, and somehow made it look regal. To what should have been no surprise, she‚Äôd drilled herself on local culture and made eating with a fork and knife look easy as she picked up another french fry.

Amilita offered some of her plate‚Äôs bacon and eggs, and looked up as a bit of commotion from Militia coming in- who appeared to relax slightly as they caught sight of their Governess chewing a mouthful of food. With a single regal wave, they took their positions outside.

‚ÄúApologies,‚Äù she dabbed at the corner of her mouth with a napkin, where a bit of liquid golden egg yolk had not quite made it past the tusk, impeccable local manners already honed. ‚ÄúWe were uncertain what to expect when we arrived, so they err on the side of caution. Given the last three Governesses, and the issues in their home systems, it‚Äôs hard to blame them. Besides, the situation, politically these days‚Ä¶‚Äù she waved a hand.

Amilita nodded as if she understood what the Cre‚Äôsin was alluding to.

Either way, she had a good feeling that Cre‚Äôsin would be the best Governess the state had ever had.

# Mail Order Groom Part 1

He was nervous.

In some respects he already knew what he was getting into. On Earth, Mail Order had *some* stigma for all involved. It would be a Sisyphean task to battle the presumptions he‚Äôd face with every introduction, waged against an entire galaxy with thousands of years of culture behind it. But he hoped, against his better judgment, that they might understand- *humanity was different*. The spaceport official's keen eye passing over every detail of the form on his omni-pad reminded him just how different this situation was- and that ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô went both ways. None of that was anxiety-inducing, because it was a known factor. Something he‚Äôd prepared for.

What had him fighting the urge to pick at his fingernails in worry was the possible assumptions that his own presumptive partner might make. Whether he‚Äôd measure up to them, and what might happen if he didn‚Äôt. The bio had been brief, and with letters taking months, he‚Äôd rolled the dice. His chance to see another world, live with an alien, and get off this godforsaken rock.

The paperwork was surprisingly light reading on his end. Surely in time bureaucracy would step in and try to either fine-tune or outright end such arrangements. Such regulations existed as protection and hindrance, and right now he was about to go forward without either. *One small button press for a man, one giant leap of faith...*

Hello, glad to have this new chapter out. It has taken a lot of work to prep them to where I'm truly happy with them, but that is okay. I've improved as a writer, and if there's anything I learned from improving Alien Nation, it's that I think I'd rather save the time up front by just getting it right the first time!

I am also shaking off the rust and getting a bit faster as we go along. I don't want to make any promises, though, as I find those make me feel bad about the possibility of not meeting them, and then I sabotage myself by avoiding writing entirely. (Very unhelpful.)

Life's about to get incredibly busy, too. Delivery of the baby, baby shower, moving, and more, (in reverse order). I don't think anyone's going to call those excuses, but we'll see how things proceed. I wanted to get this 'out the door' and see how it goes with a minimum of full-proofreading.

# Summary

A lot of introspection in this chapter. The long and short of it is that Elias is confronted with the reality that George isn't doing a terribly good job as a Battlefield Commander. We also meet the new Governess- tell me what you think of her!

There's a few pieces and references here and there, which will become relevant. Especially the stuff that seems like throwaway lines!

I found this in an 1980ish diet book. It's the 'White wine diet', supposed to help with long term stalling...

You get every day (for 2 days):
3 soft-boiled eggs, 200gr of lean beef,  1 bottle  (750ml) of very dry white wine!!!

Of course,  it's mainly fluid loss, you'd need electrolytes and - you may get slightly pissed at dinner!

Here we go:
Breakfast: 1 egg, 125ml wine, black coffee.
Lunch: 2 eggs,  250ml wine,  black coffee  
Dinner: 200gr lean beef, grilled or broiled without fat. 375ml wine, black coffee. 

So, it's keto friendly! I tried it twice in my 20ies.  The first time I lost fluids, the 2nd time I went beer partying after 'dinner'!!! So, fair warming...",0,1755432979.0,keto,1,0.33,False

1mspcmz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mspcmz,Total 125.25 euro two weeks grocery hauls for 2! (Bonus meals pics and results),"Location: Belgium

Another biweekly groceries haul (and meal ideas) from yours truly. We restocked some pantry things and spent a bit on the higher end of the budget (100 - 125 euro). But we did save a decent amount of money from the discounted things. We had some people coming over for dinner, lunch and coffee so it was super nice that we managed to get some too good to go pastries and bread from the local bakery. From the same app we also got discounted fresh fish. They went straight to the freezer and i'm looking forward to grilled mackerels once the temperature cools down a bit. 

I've also started making my own yoghurt, after successfull attempt making cow milk yoghurt, next i want to try making my own soy yoghurt. It's really significantly cheaper since we usually get our yoghurt from the bulk shop. They have really nice yoghurt from the local farmer that we can get without packaging, but it's also more expensive than the ones in the supermarket. Buying milk instead to make yoghurt saves us at least ‚Ç¨1.50 per 500ml. We also don't need a lot of energy to make yoghurt, we simply need to warm up the milk up to 85¬∞c (takes me +/- 15min), let it cool until 45¬∞c and add in the yoghurt starter which is the previously made yoghurt. Then we wrap the warm pan in hooimadam for about 8 hours or so until the yoghurt is set. Hooimadam works like a haybox, it's a cooking bag made from cotton and wool that insulates pans without electricity. We use it to make soup, stock, stew and now yoghurt. It's extremely handy to have to save on those electricity bills. 

Especially when i had to have the fans constantly on because the weather suddenly heated up and reached above 30. This also meant switching up meal plans to use as minimum heat generating cooking appliances as possible. You can see in the meal plan that we suddenly made a lot of salad and used mostly our air fryer because it produced less heat than oven. We don't have a bbq grill nor a garden for it, so we were extra reliant on our air fryer. But it was a nice challenge that i quite enjoyed üôÇ

Meals: 

1. Lentils and mushrooms k√∂ttbullar with potato gratin and salad with lettuce, cucumber, radishes and lemon mustard vinaigrette. My partner lived in sweden for 6 years and when i went to visit him i sometimes got swedish meatballs and potato gratin from the supermarket buffet. So when i saw this recipe online, it kinda gave me the nostalgia. The gravy was really good tho the meatballs were a bit too heavy, i probably used too many lentils. But it was pretty easy to make and for sure budget friendlier than the meat version
2. Lemony salmon and onion flammkuchen with salad of lettuce, rocket, cucumber, radishes, grapes, gorgonzola and white wine vinaigrette. Flammkuchen is like pizza from the alsace region in france. It's usually made with creme fraiche, onion and bacon. Instead of bacon i used some salmon cooked with lemon because that's what we had. I liked it better because it gave a nice refreshing summer taste that fit very well with the sweet caramelised onion
3. Bao bun with marinated tofu and pickled radish, paprika, carrot and cucumber. I had some time in the weekend and i had always wanted to try this recipe since i came accross it on youtube. The bao bun was easy to make, it required flour, yeast, water, sugar and some sesame oil. I marinated the tofu with soy sauce, five spice, ginger, garlic and spring onion. And i quick pickled the veggies with vinegar and sugar. I got too ambitious with the serving of the veggies haha but the tofu was there for sure. 3 buns were more than enough to keep me full and happy
4. Lentils bobotie with yellow rice and salad with lettuce, green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, rocket and chili lime dressing. Another new recipe! We got some people over for dinner and a dish like bobotie is great because we can just make a big batch and pop it in the oven. The recipe called for brown lentils but we didn't have them so my partner used the yellow ones. We got a homemade apricot jam from my in laws and he used it in the bobotie. It was sweet, refreshing and extremely filling. For sure a great budget meal to make if you want to make big sized meal
5. Gado gado with spinach, cabbage, bean sprouts, cucumber and peanut sauce, rice, and air fried tempe. Gado gado is an indonesian salad made from blanched veggies served with peanut sauce. It's very popular in the netherlands. We made our own peanut sauce since i like mine to still have that crunch, hence the thicker and lumpier texture. You can also add eggs and potatoes to make it a filling meal on its own. For the tempe i made a batter of flour, water, salt and coriander powder before air frying them
6. Chickpeas and cannellini beans salad with lettuce, rocket, parsley, paprika, cucumber and lemon tahini dressing, and toast with gorgonzola and honey balsamico figs. We really didn't want to cook because of the heat, so we made this salad. We got some figs from my in laws and they were getting soft so we brushed them with some balsamico and olive oil and popped them in the air fryer for 5 minutes. We toasted the bread and melted the gorgonzola in the air fryer too. Then we drizzled in some honey and a bit of pine nuts
7. Pasta salad with field salad, fusilli, black beans, peas, corn, cucumber, paprika, tomato and yoghurt lime dressing. Another salad dinner because it was so dang hot outside and inside. It's a caribbean inspired salad and very simple to make, but quite filling and super refreshing. You can mix in any veggies or fruits you want, i think some nice tart apples would be great here too
8. Fish and chips with salad of lettuce, paprika, tomatoes, cucumber and mozzarella. It's friday and i really felt like having some fries. My partner offered to make fish and chips and i simply couldn't say no. He used some panko to make the fish extra crunchier and he chopped the fish into smaller bites which is my preference and with a a drizzle of lemon juice they were so light, fluffy and refreshing. Yum!
9. Mondanyaki with cabbage, carrot, shiitake mushrooms and egg noodles. We make okonomiyaki from time to time to use up scraps of veggies, and this time i tried mondanyaki which used noodles. It turned out a bit deconstructed because i'm terrible at flipping pancakes. I also didn't add in mayo because i don't really like it. But one thing for sure the noodles really helped to bulk the okonomiyaki up, making it not only super delicious but even more budget friendly.
10. Sweet and sour tamarind soup with courgette, tomato, cabbage, carrot, chickpeas and rice. FINALLY the temperature went down and in celebration i made this sweet and sour tamarind soup. It's perfect for summer because it has a very fresh taste that goes perfectly with the seasonal veggies. I put in whatever leftover veggies we had left and some chickpeas, mixed in some rice and voila, a very tasty and homey soup ready to be served!",1,1755432940.0,budgetfood,2,1.0,False

My stepson (19M) recently moved back in. I was fine with it ‚Äî he‚Äôs young, needs a place to save money, cool. But apparently, he‚Äôs decided our home is now the lost-and-found section of Adam & Eve.

The first incident: I see what I think is a fancy candle holder on the mantle. Nope. Butt plug. Just standing there proudly like a participation trophy.

Then I find these mysterious ‚Äúbeads on a string‚Äù on the coffee table. My innocent brain thought, ‚ÄúOh, maybe he‚Äôs into crafting jewelry now.‚Äù WRONG. These are not prayer beads, friendship beads, or Mardi Gras beads. These are Exit-Only Highway Beads.

Last night, I bent down to pick up what looked like a cat toy under the recliner. Spoiler: it was not a cat toy. Let‚Äôs just say Garfield would not have approved.

I finally snapped and told him: ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt care what you do behind closed doors, but this house is not a museum of things that have been in your butt. Please stop decorating the common areas with your‚Ä¶ inventory.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes and said I was ‚Äúsex-negative‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing dramatic.‚Äù Bro, no. Dramatic is me explaining to my MOTHER why she couldn‚Äôt use the ‚Äúmassage beads‚Äù she found to decorate her rosary display.

The breakup was tough but I decided to be amicable since she was going through tough times but limited the meetings and texts. My ex has friends and people who she can rely on while her family is in another country. While we were dating she met my family about 4 times, we stayed with them they were getting nicely along. 
3 months after our breakup she was dating somebody else which I did not care about, it was good for her to move on. While in her new relationships, I would randomly receive messages from her asking where I was and with who around 11pm if she happened to see a story of me and my friends out. I completely ceased contact unless I needed to pickup some of my things she had kept. 
I met her once 6 months after breakup and made it clear we are not friends, barely acquaintances and that I do not care about her dating life and intimacy issues. 
She came a few weeks later to pick up some things she needed and asked who my best friend was. I answered my roommate and she started bawling her eyes out - at this time she is still in a relationship with someone else. 
I politely told her we cannot be friends, I thought it was over. 
I learned recently she broke up and has been contacting my friends to meet up coffee. That I do not mind as long as she doesn‚Äôt do it often but what bothered me as after I asked to stop contacting me and trying to reach for call or anything she started texting my family. 
How do I tell her to stop? I just want to move on and never see or hear from her again. I don‚Äôt want her in my life at all and I don‚Äôt know how to make it more clear to her

Yesterday I went out for a meal - alone - at one of my favourite restaurants here, and I took my laptop along as I like to work out of a cafe or restaurant for a change of scene. I was looking forward to a day of good food and getting some work done in one of my favourite spots.

Ordered breakfast and had just started settling in after an hour or so. It was late morning and all the breakfast diners had emptied out by then, so I was pretty much alone, with two businessmen discussing deals at the far end of the restaurant. I was enjoying myself, when promptly an Indian guy comes and takes the table right next to mine, quite unnecessary I thought, when he could have sat anywhere else. Quickly glances over at me several times, seems to take in my bag and shoes (both low-end to mid-range designer brands) and seems somewhat surprised, bcos I guess my clothes were pretty regular and I don't really look like a ""rich"" person by Dubai standards. Then he orders, and starts slurping his coffee loudly... like embarrassing level slurping, not something I would expect from a patron at an above-average priced restaurant in Dubai. Then he turns in my direction while still holding his cup and mutters something quickly, no doubt something he meant me to hear, but I couldn't catch it.

Then puts on his headphones, makes a call and starts talking loudly, partly English and partly slipping into that squeaky, high-pitched Hindi that grates on the ears. At that point I had enough, and I moved to a table at the other end of the row - and a waiter and waitress both hurry over to help me out, as if they both were expecting this. Now, the restaurant is inside a mid-range hotel, and the man was obviously a guest there, and from his call, I could make out he was discussing business. Why are Indian men even of this class - who are obviously fairly well off, travel internationally etc - behave so oddly with women? Why do they always try to make you feel uncomfortable? Do they genuinely feel discomfort at seeing women just being themselves and living their lives? Or do they think any woman alone, by herself, in a public space is fair game?

This had often been my experience living in India - if i tried to go watch a movie alone or be at a cafe by myself, enjoying my day - some loser would sit right behind me or next to me and start staring and troubling, but I did not expect Indian men in Dubai of above average socioeconomic means to display this behaviour. If they want to approach you, there is a decent way to do that - by saying hello and making conversation in a polite way.

# best Styrofoam Cups in 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Styrofoam cups, despite facing growing concerns about environmental impact, remain a ubiquitous and frequently enough indispensable item in various settings. From offices and events to homes and restaurants, their lightweight nature, insulation properties, and affordability continue to make them a popular choice for serving both hot and cold beverages. As we approach 2025, advances in manufacturing and material science are leading to more sustainable and versatile styrofoam cup options. This guide provides a extensive overview of the best styrofoam cups available, helping you make an informed decision based on your specific needs and priorities. We'll explore key features, benefits, answer frequently asked questions, and provide competitor comparisons to equip you with the knowledge necessary to choose the perfect styrofoam cup for your requirements.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of styrofoam cups is determined by several crucial features that influence their durability, insulation capabilities, and overall user experience.Choosing cups with the right features is essential for both practical use and cost-effectiveness.

**Density and Thickness:** Determine Cup Strength and Insulation.

The density and thickness of the styrofoam material directly impact the cup's structural integrity and its ability to insulate beverages. Higher density cups, typically ranging from 0.015 to 0.025 g/cm¬≥, are more rigid and less prone to crushing or leaking, especially when filled with hot liquids. A thicker cup wall,often between 2mm and 4mm,provides better insulation,keeping hot drinks hot for longer periods and preventing hands from getting burned. lower density, thinner cups may be more economical but often sacrifice durability and insulation performance, making them more suitable for cold beverages or single-use situations.

**Rim Design:** Crucial For User Comfort And Lid Compatibility.

The design of the cup rim significantly affects user comfort and compatibility with lids,if applicable. A rolled rim,which is commonly seen in high-quality styrofoam cups,provides a smoother and more comfortable drinking experience compared to a sharp or unfinished edge. The rolled rim also enhances the cup's structural integrity, preventing it from deforming easily when squeezed. Moreover, a well-defined rim is critical for achieving a secure and leak-proof fit with standard-sized lids, which is especially crucial for takeaway beverages. The rim diameter usually spans from 90mm to 95mm, aligning with common lid sizes.

**Surface Texture:** Impacts Grip and Handling.

The surface texture of a styrofoam cup plays a key role in grip and handling, notably when the cup contains hot or cold liquids. A slightly textured surface offers better traction, reducing the likelihood of the cup slipping from the user's hand, even when condensation forms on the external surface. Some cups may feature a more pronounced textured pattern for enhanced grip, while others have a smoother finish for a more refined appearance. The choice of surface texture ultimately depends on the intended use and the user's preference for tactile feel and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Composition:** Influences Heat Resistance and Safety.

While traditionally made from polystyrene, advancements in material science have led to the growth of styrofoam cups incorporating additives or option polymers to enhance heat resistance and safety. Some cups may utilize a blend of polystyrene with additives to improve their ability to withstand higher temperatures without deforming or leaching chemicals. It's essential to check for certifications that indicate the cups are food-grade and safe for contact with hot beverages. Look for cups that comply with safety standards established by regulatory bodies like FDA or equivalent organizations.

**Stackability and Storage:** Affects Practicality and Convenience.

The stackability of styrofoam cups directly influences their practicality and convenience for storage and dispensing,particularly in high-volume environments. cups designed with a slight taper and smooth exterior surfaces stack easily, allowing for efficient use of space and minimizing the risk of jamming or sticking together. Good stackability also facilitates easy dispensing from cup dispensers, reducing the amount of time and effort required to serve beverages. The height of the cup stack is also an critically important consideration, and the cups must fit into standard cup dispensers.

## Core Benefits

Styrofoam cups offer several distinct advantages that continue to make them a popular choice despite concerns regarding sustainability. When chosen and used responsibly, these cups provide practical benefits that are hard to ignore.**Superior Insulation:** Keeps Beverages Hot or Cold Longer.

Styrofoam's closed-cell structure provides excellent insulation, effectively slowing down the transfer of heat between the contents of the cup and the surrounding environment. A hot beverage poured into a styrofoam cup will retain its temperature for significantly longer than in a paper or plastic cup. Similarly, a cold beverage will stay colder for an extended period, making styrofoam cups ideal for both coffee, tea, and chilled drinks. This is particularly beneficial in settings where beverages are consumed over time or when preventing temperature fluctuations is important.

**Lightweight and Portable:** Easy to Handle and Transport.

Styrofoam cups are exceptionally lightweight, making them easy to handle and transport, even when filled. Their lightweight nature reduces strain on users, particularly those carrying multiple cups or serving beverages for extended periods. This is a important advantage compared to heavier alternatives like ceramic mugs or glass cups, which can be cumbersome and tiring to carry. The lightweight properties of styrofoam cups make them a preferred choice for events,outdoor activities,and situations where portability is essential.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** An Economical Option for Large Gatherings.

styrofoam cups are generally more affordable than other types of disposable cups, such as paper or compostable options.This cost-effectiveness makes them a practical choice for large gatherings, parties, or events where a high volume of cups is needed. The lower price point allows organizers to provide beverages to a large number of people without exceeding their budget. While the environmental impact should always be considered, the affordability of styrofoam cups can be a significant factor for organizations or individuals operating on a limited budget.

**Easy and Convenient:** Disposable and Require minimal Cleanup.

One of the main advantages of styrofoam cups is their disposability,which eliminates the need for washing and sanitizing. This makes them incredibly convenient for situations where time and resources for cleaning are limited. After use, the cups can simply be disposed of, saving time and effort on cleanup. While responsible disposal and recycling,where available,is encouraged,the convenience of disposable cups remains a significant benefit for many consumers.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about styrofoam cups can definitely help consumers make more informed decisions about their purchase.**Are Styrofoam Cups Safe for Hot Beverages?**

Yes, styrofoam cups made from food-grade polystyrene are generally considered safe for hot beverages. However, it's important to choose cups that are labeled as safe for hot use and that comply with relevant safety standards. High temperatures can cause some leaching of chemicals from the polystyrene,but studies indicate that the levels are typically within safe limits.Be sure to avoid using styrofoam cups in microwave ovens, as excessive heat can cause them to melt or deform.

**Can Styrofoam Cups Be Recycled?**

The recyclability of styrofoam cups varies depending on local recycling facilities and the type of styrofoam. Some communities have recycling programs that accept polystyrene, while others do not.Check with your local recycling center to determine if they accept styrofoam and what specific types are recyclable. Even if your local program doesn't accept them, some specialized recycling centers may accept styrofoam for processing.

**What are the Environmental Concerns Associated with Styrofoam Cups?**

Styrofoam, or expanded polystyrene (EPS), is a petroleum-based product that does not readily biodegrade in the environment. This means that styrofoam cups can persist in landfills for a very long time, contributing to waste accumulation. The production of styrofoam also involves the use of fossil fuels and can release greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. These environmental concerns have led to increased efforts to promote the use of more sustainable alternatives, such as paper cups or reusable containers.

**Are There Biodegradable or Compostable Alternatives to Styrofoam Cups?**

Yes, several biodegradable or compostable alternatives to styrofoam cups are available.these alternatives are typically made from plant-based materials like paper,cornstarch,or sugarcane bagasse. Biodegradable cups will break down naturally over time, while compostable cups can be processed in commercial composting facilities. These alternatives are often more environmentally friendly than styrofoam, but they may also be more expensive, and compostable ones require special facilities to properly decompose.

1msp757,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1msp757/some_community_questions_about_my_hypertension/,Some community questions about my hypertension.,"New to the community and new to navigating my situation.

48 (just about) year old male who just got diagnosed with hypertension from my cardiologist. Last couple of years have been stressful. Job I don't like, living situation thats untenable, trying to find a new house (we are right in the middle of bidding and contract negotiations when I had both doctor apps. - coincidental, not on purpose). Last time I had routine blood work with my primary, my BP was like 132/85. he wasn't too concerned since i'v never had it high before. My labs then were ok except my LDL's were like 132.

I was never been ""obese"" but I have always fluctuated 15-25 pounds since i'm a teenager. I'll binge workout and get rid of it and then over time slowly put it back. I'm extremely active but my eating habits were just ok. So between my last blood work and the one I got 2 weeks ago, I lost 25 pounds, down to 140 lbs (i'm 5'3). I do 4-6 hours of steady state cardio each week and 2-3 days of weight training. I haven't been this fit since I was 18. I don't smoke or do drugs and my alcohol consumption is around 4 drinks over a 7 day period, usually just the weekends. 2-3 cups of coffee a day. Started eating what I thought was cleaner (more fruit, more chicken, don't drink sugar drinks and haven't had fast food in years, but I do have Friday pizza lol) but stress level stayed up throughout the last 2 years.

I also got diagnosed with mild sleep apnea like 7 years ago. Tried the C-pap with no luck so I wear an oral over the counter device. I don't sleep very well at all.

So when I went to get BW 2 weeks ago, the Nurse took my pressure (which I had been psyching myself up that it was going to be high (because I stress at everything) and it was 182/80. Doctor came in and took it again and got 160/80. We talked about stress factors and what i'm doing and he was concerned since the previous 3 days leading up, we were in full house negotiations and I started getting headaches as well. He suggested meds for a little while to try and get it under control with the notion that the stress would be ""short lived"" and that once i calmed down, I could taper off. Told him I had an app with my cardiologist 5 days later and he deferred to hearing what he had to say and following whatever he said. I had made that app. a while back as I had an issue one night doing cardio (tightness + fatigue) and wanted to just have him check my heart. PS: New blood work after 2 years of what i though was doing better in all categories and my LDL's were 148. HDL's good. Tri's were good, ratio was good, but I was kind of pissed as I've worked so hard over the last 2 years and these numbers were effectively worse. Should also note, I take a multivitamin, magnesium and fish oil daily.

Anticipation of something sucks and I took that in to the cardiologist app. BP was consistently 140/90 (I guess better than before lol). Explained everything to him and he diagnosed me with hypertension on the spot. He ordered an echo cardiogram and a stress test (both next week), said to get a BP machine and start checking my pressure in the morning and evening and wanted me on medication (He said, most likely never getting off of them) which he suggested Losartan - 50 mg. I asked about Amlodepine and he said that can mess with the kidneys more than than Losartan. EKG was normal.

Did everything he said and ever since starting meds and checking pressure over the last 5 days, my average has been 115/75 which is awesome, but i don't feel any better.

But, the side effects... I'm MORE tired now in the morning than I was before the medicine. I have some slight muscle fatigue and most notably, hard to get/keep erections and they are not as ""stiff"" if that makes sense. I don't know if i'm not 'thinking"" about it or not but I def feel weird or vague in that department. Gastro has been a little off as well.

I should also mention that my dad has been on BP meds for about 25-30 years and he's 84. Also a statin for Cholesterol. We never definitively found a genetic dispostion but he manifests stress just like I do, so there is that. I've also had some ED issues in the past after getting diagnosed with Peyronies in 2018. It has come and gone but mostly been gone the last 3 years or so. Supplement Cialis - 5mg as needed.

Long winded I know but my questions for anyone who has experience with this is as I know it's only been 5 days on meds:

1. Would dropping to 25 mg maybe help alleviate some of the effects? Can you go lower than that?
2. Once the smoke clears with the house stuff, i would like to try and taper off to see if stress was really pushing me high (Even though cardiologist said probably not). Anyone have any experience tapering off Losartan or any BP med?
3. Anyone experience any of the side effects I am, and any remedies?
4. Anyone switch from this drug to Amlodepine?
5. Am I too early taking the meds and the side effects could go away with longer term usage?

Thats all I can think of right now. Thank you for taking the time and reading and any insight. We are in attorney review on a home as of this morning and a big move coming from NYC to NJ while starting work (I'm a teacher) and my echo is Monday the 25th and my stress test is the 29th.

Regards,

Vin

1msoxqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Embermug/comments/1msoxqt/new_cold_tumblr_isnt_worth_the_money/,New Cold Tumblr isn‚Äôt worth the money,"While I know folks have mixed opinions on Ember‚Äôs flagship design, we have one each and have had no issues. When we received an email over the summer giving a preorder link for a new tumbler that would keep drinks cold for (supposedly) 6 hours, we preordered one for each of us. 

I cannot say enough how much I do not recommend it. The design is sleek and the lid/straw design is good. They have a silicon piece you insert the straw into that helps prevent spillage, and I assume was intended to help with temperature control. But looks are where my praise ends.

In our air conditioned home that was 68 degrees, first use of the tumbler we found it was sweating all over the counter in less than 5 minutes. We weren‚Äôt outside in hot weather, we were in air conditioning. The ice continued to sit and melt inside of the tumbler. And this was not a hot drink poured over ice. It was a drink that was cold from the start. 

This is not a $40 cold tumbler. It‚Äôs a thicker version of the many, many plastic iced coffee cups that sweat all over and melt quickly. This felt like a cash grab by the company.

Save your money and time on returns and spend the extra for a Yeti or other reputable brand that has been making cups meant to stay cold for extended periods of time but for years now. ",2,1755431678.0,Embermug,0,1.0,False
1msoxjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1msoxjv/should_you_switch_to_seventh_generation_dish_soap/,Should You Switch to Seventh Generation Dish Soap for Greener Cleaning?,"Testing out the Seventh Generation 10732913221711 dishwasher detergent gel, I was curious whether its plant-based formula and environmentally friendly credentials could really bring the kind of performance I need in a busy household kitchen. I have to take care of mountains of dishes daily‚Äîthanks to two kids who think cooking is an Olympic sport‚Äîand this seemed like a promising option that I could feel good about using. It claims to be free of synthetic fragrances, dyes, chlorine, and phosphates, along with being 65 percent bio-based, which seems perfect if you‚Äôre cautious about what goes down the drain. But does it actually live up to these claims while still being potent enough for stubborn grease and mystery food crusts?

**Fresh Lemon Scent, Not Overpowering**  
Right off the bat, the lemon scent was inviting. Not the artificial, chemical-like lemon smell you sometimes get with detergents, but a genuine, natural aroma derived from essential oils and botanical extracts. I‚Äôm a sucker for anything that doesn‚Äôt reek of synthetic fragrances, so this scored major brownie points during the first use. It left the dishes smelling fresh‚Äîbut not overwhelmingly so‚Äîand didn‚Äôt linger too long, which I liked because I personally don‚Äôt need my coffee mug to keep perfuming my cupboard.

**Effectiveness Against Grease and Stubborn Stains**  
Using this dishwashing gel on various loads of dirty dishes, I found that it performed admirably on everyday messes like oily pans, coffee stains, and pasta sauce streaks. Enzymes in the formula break down starches and proteins, which is one of the key reasons this works so efficiently. However, I did notice it had to be used liberally when dealing with full-day grease buildups, like roast pans or cheese plates. Sometimes, I had to re-run those items for absolute cleanliness. That said, it nailed the usual culprits like egg residue, which can be notoriously stubborn.

**[Check Seventh Generation 10732913221711 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b000c4az8q/)**

**Eco-Friendly and Sustainable**  
As someone who's seen one too many ""greenwashed"" products on shelves, I appreciated that this dish detergent has legitimate certifications‚ÄîUSDA Certified Bio-based at 65 percent and comes from a Certified B Corporation. It genuinely feels like a step in the right direction for sustainability. There‚Äôs no chlorine, phosphate, or other harsh chemicals, so I felt better knowing this is safer for aquatic life when it washes down the drain. For anyone wanting to minimize their environmental footprint, this could easily be a go-to option.

**Usability and Packaging**  
The bottle is lightweight and has a good grip for easy pouring, which counts when you‚Äôre handling soapy hands. The gel consistency itself is smooth and doesn‚Äôt clump‚Äîhuge relief compared to powder alternatives that can be overly messy. Plus, the measurement marks on the cap help regulate just the right amount per load. I‚Äôll admit I wished it came in a recyclable package or ideally something refillable, but it‚Äôs still an improvement over single-use pods encased in plastic.

**Advantages**  
Here are some of the standout qualities that made all the difference to me:  
- Natural lemon scent from 100 percent essential oils.  
- Plant-based formula cleans effectively without harmful chemicals.  
- Biodegradable ingredients align with eco-conscious goals.  
- Certified as a bio-based product by USDA.  

**Pitfalls**  
To keep it real, here's where it could still improve:  
- Struggles a bit with heavy grease unless extra detergent is used.  
- Investing in recyclable or refillable packaging could enhance its commitment to sustainability.  

**Competitive Options**  
When stacked against supermarket stalwarts like Cascade or Finish, the Seventh Generation gel has a clear eco-friendly advantage. Cascade‚Äôs pods, for instance, are notorious for their environmentally unfriendly single-use plastic wraps, while Seventh Generation offers peace of mind for earth-conscious buyers. Finish, on the other hand, does better for extreme grease loads thanks to its industrial-strength formulation, but it's far from gentle on the environment. While it doesn‚Äôt clean as aggressively as some competitors, what this dishwasher gel lacks in brute force, it makes up for with healthier ingredient choices.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Without diving into exact pricing, this gel falls in the ballpark of other mid-tier dishwasher detergents, yet you‚Äôre paying for the added value of an environmentally considerate product. If you‚Äôre already shifting to a more sustainable lifestyle, this feels like smart spending because you‚Äôre combining functionality with a reduction in harmful impact. And for that, it feels worth every penny in households that can manage the occasional double rinse for ultra-dirty dishes.

I moved to a different country. I hooked up with a guy who is in an open relationship. The guy is a great man and he helped me get familiar with the area and basically with assimilating. Yes, we often had sex, and I heard him bragging to his friend that he feels so happy around me. But often we were just spending time together ‚Äî playing chess, sending memes back and forth, going for walks, doing self-tapes (we are both actors).   

At some point, his husband turned a bit hostile towards me (he didn‚Äôt like me from the very beginning), and I was pretty much not allowed into their house. It was never explicitly said, but the comments were always like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù And then one day he told me that we couldn‚Äôt see each other regularly anymore because it was ruining his marriage. He still wanted to stay in touch and talk often via WhatsApp, but face-to-face meetings had to be less frequent. I took it on the chin and said I understood. We talked almost daily. And then less and less frequently. Then it turned into a ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù every year and no messages in between. And then it stopped.   

I started it again. I offered to grab a coffee. He replied almost immediately. We hugged each other and stayed in this hug for a very long time without saying anything. Then we sat down and started catching up. After that, we had a few more coffee meetings like that, and every time it was me asking him. He never messaged first. In one of those meetings, he gave me Call Me By Your Name, saying that he feels like this is our story. I actually read it, and the way I understood it‚Ä¶ they were both unhappy (?).   

He repeatedly told me that I need to stop seeing him and move on, and I repeatedly told him to mind his own business and stop telling me how to live my life.   

And so we kept meeting like that, and we kept hugging each other for what felt like forever before we sat down and had a coffee. One day we couldn‚Äôt schedule the coffee meeting, and he said he would let me know when he had a bit more time. That was a year ago. This year I texted him just ‚Äúhello,‚Äù and he replied immediately. It was in January. It‚Äôs August now. I haven‚Äôt replied. I think I was just annoyed that he never texted me first.   

So TL;DR: I hooked up with a guy in an open relationship. It looks like I almost ruined their marriage, so we ended up getting coffees only. But it‚Äôs only me trying while he keeps telling me to move on. I miss his voice, his laugh, his smile, his intelligence.

2 days ago my Kitten (she has completed 3 months ) started isolating and stopped eating, and started vomiting multiple times.
I took her to vet and they gave antibiotics injection.
After that she got lethargic and stopped playing, from yesterday midnight she's having severe diaherra, loose stool like coffee water and it smells very bad. 
I spoke to Vet and they suggested me to keep eye on her and let her fast for whole day. 
I called them back today as it's Sunday most they're closed.
Vet suggested me to give her plain icecream if she's willing to eat or atleast force feed some spoon. 
He also gave me some antibiotics to give through honey.

She's pooping after every 2 hours please help me.
Pet shops told me not to give her anything as she might puke and it would make situation worse.
I was thinking of giving her some pumpkin pulp with chicken stalk but scared it might make things worse

How do I stop severe diaherra ? 
Vet has given me Enterogermina to give her 1ml dosage 3 times in a day.


Idk please help me I am trying to save my child.

1msonlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1msonlw/story_i_never_told_my_fiance/,Story I Never Told My Fiance,"
Back in college, I had this silly little secret. I had a crush on him, but of course, he never knew. No one did. At that time, uso yung trend na kapag ginawa mong wallpaper yung crush mo for 100 days na walang nakakita, magiging kayo. Desperate as I was, I tried it. For a month, his face was hidden on my phone screen. But nothing happened. He didn‚Äôt even know my name. Life moved on.


After college, life wasn‚Äôt always kind. I met someone else ‚Äî a lonely man from my previous posts. For a while, I thought maybe he was the one. He in a way, became a ghost I carried with me. With him, it was always heavy, full of doubts, full of what-ifs. I never felt safe, never really sure. Looking back, all I remember was loneliness, even when I wasn‚Äôt technically alone.

Six years later, I saw him or maybe he saw me first. We just smiled at each other, the way you do when you recognize someone from the past. Then another time, I saw him in a caf√© in the same line. Until finally, he said, ‚ÄúDiba‚Ä¶ same university tayo dati?‚Äù And that‚Äôs how our first real conversation started we  shared a table that time.

After that, he messaged me. Honestly, I was excited ‚Äî this was my old crush! He kept asking me to have coffee again, but I didn‚Äôt want things to feel too planned. I didn‚Äôt tell him that, of course. I just said, ‚ÄúNext time nalang. Pag nagkita ulit tayo.‚Äù I even avoided that caf√© for months. One time he asked me, ‚ÄúBakit hindi na kita nakikita dun?‚Äù Sinabi ko nlng na hindi ko alam.

And then one night, while I was at another caf√© working on my laptop, someone suddenly sat across from me. I looked up, and it was him. He smiled and said, ‚ÄúNakita din kita.‚Äù That‚Äôs when it really started.

With him, there were no doubts. No endless what-ifs like before. Everything was moving forward, progressing. For the first time in a long time, I started dreaming again ‚Äî not just of a new job or a better career, but of a real future. A future with him.

Fast forward, we‚Äôre engaged.

What‚Äôs funny is I never told him that I once made him my wallpaper. That back in college, I secretly wished for us to end up together. Maybe I never will. Because at the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter how it started. What matters is that now, he‚Äôs the man I‚Äôm marrying.

Sometimes I think about how small the world is, how amazing it was that we met again after all those years. And I can‚Äôt help but believe ‚Äî sometimes, God puts you in the right place, at the right time, with the right person.

And that‚Äôs exactly how I found my Fiance.",2,1755430790.0,AlasFeels,2,1.0,False
1msomwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheBits/comments/1msomwm/reveal_the_best_business_laptop_lenovo_thinkpad/,Reveal the Best Business Laptop Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 Review,"Lenovo T14 Gen 5 became part of my daily setup not long ago, and it‚Äôs been a mix of great highs and a few small grumbles. They market it as a business powerhouse, but I‚Äôve tested it for everything from spreadsheets to some light gaming (don‚Äôt judge, a little break is necessary). Here‚Äôs my personal take.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The black chassis of the Lenovo T14 Gen 5 is quintessential ThinkPad‚Äîsleek, professional, and sturdy. I‚Äôve carried this thing from office meetings to coffee shops, and it just radiates ‚Äúbusiness professional.‚Äù The 14-inch screen is compact but never feels small thanks to the crisp 1920x1200 IPS panel. Yes, it‚Äôs not 4K, but let‚Äôs be real, on a 14-inch display, that resolution is plenty sharp. The keyboard deserves a standing ovation. Whether I‚Äôm typing up reports or chatting with friends, the keys are like butter: tactile and spaced perfectly. It‚Äôs so good that my colleague tried it once and ended up ordering his own ThinkPad.  

[Check Lenovo T14 Gen 5 price on Amazon.](https://solarpark.org/p/b0dqvm3k8f/)  

**Performance with Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor**  
Under the hood, the 14th Gen Intel Core Ultra 7 processor isn‚Äôt messing around. Running a dozen browser tabs, an Excel sheet, and a video conference at once? Easy. It stays responsive, saving me countless hours I‚Äôd usually lose to lag on other laptops. What‚Äôs amazing is the quiet fan operation. Even under load, the fans whisper instead of roaring in your face. My old laptop sounded like it was about to take off when I pushed it. However, while the integrated graphics handle regular tasks effortlessly, they‚Äôre not built for hardcore graphic-intense operations. Light gaming and video editing are fine, but demanding games push it past its comfort zone quickly.  

**Good Points**  
- Strong daily performance even with resource-heavy tasks.  
- Exceptional keyboard comfort for long hours.  
- Quiet operation that doesn‚Äôt intrude, even under load.  

**Connectivity Options and Battery Life**  
The T14 Gen 5 isn‚Äôt stingy when it comes to ports. Two Thunderbolt 4 slots keep my secondary monitor and external SSDs happy, and the USB options are diverse enough to connect just about anything. The Dockztorm portable USB hub included in the package is an underrated gem. It‚Äôs compact and has been a lifesaver, especially with the added syncing features for my data. The internal battery is solid, offering around 7‚Äì8 hours, which covers most of my meetings without recharging. However, I do feel slightly cheated since some competitors hit the 10-hour mark with similar specs.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The battery life could be better compared to similarly priced laptops.  
- Integrated graphics limit gaming and heavy visual tasks.  

**Storage and Memory**  
The 32GB DDR5 RAM is a multitasker‚Äôs dream. Switching between twenty tabs and a couple of streaming apps feels seamless and effortless. And don‚Äôt get me started on the 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD‚Äîit‚Äôs enormous and lightning-fast. It holds all my work files, some movies, and backups without breaking a sweat. Is it overkill for me? Maybe. But strangers to data mismanagement will find comfort in this sprawling storage capacity.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to Dell‚Äôs XPS series or HP Spectre x360, the Lenovo T14 Gen 5 holds its own with its robust keyboard and professional design. Dell may edge out with display vibrancy, and HP flaunts more sleek portability, but neither matches ThinkPad's ruggedness and functionality. The ThinkPad is a workhorse, while some competitors feel tuned more for luxury or style‚Äîgood for show, maybe not as much for go.  

**True Value**  
Here‚Äôs the question that tech purchases boil down to‚Äîwas the Lenovo T14 Gen 5 worth its price tag? When considering the powerful Intel processor, reliable storage, and top-tier usability wrapped in a durable shell, there‚Äôs no doubt it delivers good value. While it‚Äôs marketed for business users, the overall versatility makes it stand out. Though, if your goal centers around extended outdoor use (battery longevity) or gaming, you might want to explore alternatives.

1msomdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1msomdk/i_could_use_some_insight/,I could use some insight.,"Hi, 36, Sagittarius, BPD, DID, heterosexual cis-man‚Ä¶ idk why I figured it‚Äôs a good way to clear up who I am‚Ä¶

A woman I feel in love with and dated for about a year ended the relationship. (33, Virgo, pansexual, cis-woman) she was reserved and as our dating went on I could feel her pull away, the day it ended she seemed different and annoyed. I can‚Äôt really tell facial expressions and I‚Äôm known to overthink words a lot so I am usually pretty straight forward with what I say and ask. When I asked if she was ok, she said fine. And said if you‚Äôre really fine that‚Äôs ok. But if you wanted to share anything else I would like to listen. She said no and we continued. She continued to be annoyed with me and goofing around a bit. When it came time for bed she said you could play fallout on Amazon. I said no way and she was full of it. She aggressively shows me the ad and asks, ‚Äúwhy am I being such a little bitch today?‚Äù I froze, she never talked to me like that before. Were into some heavy bedroom play but humiliation was never on my list and nor hers so I knew she meant it. 

The next morning I was frozen in depression. The woman I grew to love and hope to start a relationship with just cut me down in a way I never knew. My insecurities were creeping in. I could hear my mother say, ‚Äúno one will ever love you the way I do.‚Äù Look at it now it‚Äôs just a mother‚Äôs words towards their kids. But to me, and the many abusive and manipulative ex‚Äôs I was with and one engaged to saying the same thing to me. All I could hear was I was ‚Äúunlovable, intolerable, useless, and crazy.‚Äù I finally arose and she had passively aggressively made me coffee and wouldn‚Äôt look at me. I gathered my courage to ask if we could talk about last night. She whips her head around and said ‚Äúyeah, we should talk.‚Äù I tried to stay calm and not let an identity out because I‚Äôve started EMDR a couple years prior and working on being primary and not disassociate in serious conversations. She kept getting defensive with everything I was saying. And I would ask questions about some things that were on my mind to try and understand, I noticed before bed a guy texted her a few times. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it till she called me a bitch that maybe she is on her way out? And so I asked if this plus this guy are some how connected. And she asked me my thoughts. ‚ÄúWell I grabbed your phone for you because you had wondered to bed without it so I grabbed it to give you and noticed this guys name and 4 unread texts. I wouldn‚Äôt ever think you‚Äôd cheat on me but maybe he was looking for closure on something, maybe he‚Äôs a friend that I haven‚Äôt met that needed a hand.‚Äù But before I could get to any of that she yelled at me and I disassociated and I guess I had yelled back and said something mean. I apologized and ask if we can try again and she wouldn‚Äôt. I asked is she over me and this relationship and she didn‚Äôt answer me. I asked once again and added if you can just answer me yes or no that would really help me. Again, she said nothing and began to cry‚Ä¶ I told her I‚Äôm gunna take it as a yes. I proceeded to pack up all my things, telling her my struggles, my insecurities, my highs in the time we spent and hopes that she is happy and will find what she‚Äôs looking for. All while crying my eyes out. We hugged and said goodbye.

Flash forward to a few months later.

I started seeing, not dating, an ex that was manipulative and abusive. She is nice (40, Leo, heterosexual, cis-woman.) and Virgo reached out. She said she wanted to be friends and if I was available to hangout because she was in town. I said of course, and we hung out that day. It was nice, she‚Äôs quiet but found my babbling endearing, l asked her if she wanted to go see a movie and when we went to the theater we were asked to evict the building because of a gas leak. I was fresh out of ideas. She asked if we can go back to my place and watch something. I asked if you‚Äôre ok with that then that‚Äôs ok. Once we got to my place we talked seriously, I know she‚Äôs like me and would like a heads up when serious talk is coming up because it gets overwhelming. But she initiated and I wanted to be respectful. It didn‚Äôt feel like an apology but it offered clarity. The guy was an old crush that would talk from time to time and tell her about his woes, she did start to pull away because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what she does‚Äù, and she said she missed me. I was thankful and she and I also proceeded to see each other. Again, not dating. 

A couple months go by and Virgo wanted an answer. Her or Leo. I needed time to think and what I concluded was Leo was a seriously kind person. She has amazing style, easily approachable, amazing family, and was very much in love with me. Virgo, she avoids conflict, she‚Äôs GORGEOUS, she‚Äôs has hobbies opposite of mine and I loved getting involved with some of her things. (She once said she‚Äôd read to me if I ever wanted to and I desperately wanted that.) and the sex was without a doubt top tier. But I can‚Äôt have her avoid topics and I wanted some real back and forth with emotions and feelings because that‚Äôs unfortunately all I got. I told Virgo I‚Äôm gunna start exclusively dating Leo. She was not happy and really let me have it. I understood and accepted what she felt about me and that was that. 

Here‚Äôs were I‚Äôm not a good person‚Ä¶

A couple months pass.

Virgo hit me up for help with electrical problem. I‚Äôm an electrician, Leo and I are not on good grounds, and I wanted to see and talk to Virgo again, so I go and help her out we talk and catch up and she asks me about Leo, I say we‚Äôre good but she presses, I tell her the truth and she seemed upset to hear that. Once I finished helping her she asked if I wanted to stay? She‚Äôs got a pool and bought me a 6 pack of my favorite beer. We started talking and laughing and showing each other new music we‚Äôve found. We‚Äôre done in the pool and decided to watch a movie that came out and we went and changed, I went into her room after we were both done changing and looking at her she was beautiful and I thought back to the time we had and how I missed that. We embraced and kissed. The rest of the day was us hold each other and anything but penetrated sex. We talked for a bit afterwards and I was starting to. Feel guilty, I knew what I did was horribly wrong and riddled by guilt she asked if we could be together. I panicked and we cut ties there‚Ä¶. I had never felt like that since I had lost my dog earlier that time and I had felt like I fucked up.

Time goes on, and we‚Äôre today,

I‚Äôm doing my best to make this relationship with a woman who all my friends love! People love her, she‚Äôs adored by all. But why the fuck am I not there!? I  am getting ready to head back to my hometown for the weekend and I hope online and see Virgo is in a relationship I yelled at the top of my lungs and pullover and put on sleep token, a band that she loved and haven‚Äôt listened to because it just reminds me of her. And cried till I had snot dripping from my nose and dry heaving from the lack of oxygen I‚Äôm taking in. Out of a pathetic attempt an identity started messaging her roommate, noticing this I snap out of crying and try to stop it but it too late and of course her. Room mate was pretty upset and she‚Äôs not one to just let things slide. 

Virgo has blocked me on social media, I‚Äôm left here broken hearted again for reasons I can‚Äôt understand, and my relationship with Leo is even rockier than it was ever before. I‚Äôm not a good man. But I want to be, I want to be so badly it hurts. I want to hold my head up high and feel ray of warm light hit the top of my head down to my feet and radiate the love and happiness I give. But I‚Äôm afraid and afraid to do anything.",1,1755430673.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

Anyways , yesterday I was in the bathtub trying to alleviate exhaustion, acid reflux, nausea and just feeling overall depleted cause the night before I had terrible terrible insomnia . And I‚Äôm reading Reddit to relax. And my phone starts ringing cause a friend of mine from another state wants to chat. But I‚Äôm not feeling chatty. Last time she called me 3 weeks ago, I was not feeling chatty. This specific person, I was not feeling chatty with cause the last couple times we chatted I just felt a little off about the conversation. Like for example, she commented on how she can tell with the webcam that my breasts are super enlarged and wanted to go into deep details about child birth. Then when the conversation ended, mentioned how she would like to continue this discussion about details surrounding childbirth‚Äî and I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúGIRLfirend, if you want details about child birth, there is YouTube.‚Äù But since then I‚Äôve been avoiding calls from her. 

I have my induction in 5 days and I do not plan to disclose that to her at all cause I don‚Äôt want to talk about my anxieties about it with her or about the process.

1msobbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1msobbl/delve_into_the_ilpeod_bean_bag_chair_review_is_it/,Delve Into the ILPEOD Bean Bag Chair Review Is It Really Worth It,"**An Honest Review of ILPEOD 3 Feet Bean Bag Chair**

I‚Äôve been testing the ILPEOD 3 Feet Bean Bag Chair for a few weeks now, and I must say, it‚Äôs one of those products that quickly became a staple in my daily routine. Whether I‚Äôm lounging after a long day, reading a book, or gaming for hours, this chair has been a versatile and comfortable option. A friend even borrowed it for their dorm room, and they didn‚Äôt want to give it back‚Äîso there‚Äôs your first clue about its popularity.

**Comfort You Can Sink Into**

The first thing I noticed about this bean bag chair was its incredible softness. Made with a super-soft short plush fabric, it feels amazingly smooth and is undeniably skin-friendly. The breathable material is not just comfortable but also keeps you from overheating during long gaming or movie marathons. I‚Äôve spent late nights lounging in this chair with no complaints about stiffness, and the softness alone makes it worth having in any space.

**Functional Design and Versatility**

One of the noteworthy features here is the design. At 3 feet, the bean bag is the perfect medium size‚Äîbig enough for adults but compact enough not to dominate the room. I‚Äôve moved it around between the living room, bedroom, and even outdoors for some fresh air. Whether you‚Äôre using it as a gaming chair, a reading nook, or just to kick back, it easily fits into any setting. Its modern, round shape suits most interiors, and the neutral gray shade blends in perfectly with different decor styles.

[Check ILPEOD 3 Feet Bean Bag Chair price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b0ck9c2sn2/)

**Durability That Holds Up**

What really impressed me was the high-rebound sponge used for filling. Unlike some cheaper bean bag chairs that sag after a few uses, this one maintains its shape well over time. It arrived compressed, so I did have to wait a day or two for it to fluff up completely, but once it did, it stayed that way. Sitting on it feels cushioned yet supportive, which is especially great for long durations of sitting. Another interesting aspect is that you can adjust the fill‚Äîremove or add more sponge as you see fit to tailor the firmness exactly to your liking.

**Machine-Washable Cover: A Real Plus**

One of the ILPEOD bean bag chair's standout features is its machine-washable cover. Let me tell you, as someone who‚Äôs spilled coffee one too many times, this feature is a lifesaver. It‚Äôs easy to unzip, toss the cover into the washing machine, and voila‚Äîit‚Äôs fresh and clean again. I‚Äôve washed it twice already, and the material holds up as if it were brand new. This added practicality makes it ideal for households with pets or kids, where spills and messes are inevitable.

**Merits**

- Plush, skin-friendly, breathable fabric offers next-level comfort.  
- Size is perfect for most indoor and even outdoor settings.  
- High-rebound sponge filling stays firm without sagging.  
- Cover is easily removable and machine-washable for convenience.  

**Caveats**

- The chair arrives compressed, taking 1-2 days to fluff fully.  
- Limited color options for those not inclined toward gray.   
- Heavier than expected for its size, making frequent moves challenging.  

**Product Competitors**

If you‚Äôre exploring similar options, a few names come to mind. Take the Big Joe Milano Bean Bag Chair, for instance. It‚Äôs another comfortable choice, though I found its smaller size less versatile for adults when compared to the ILPEOD chair. Next, there‚Äôs the Chill Sack Memory Foam Bean Bag, which rivals ILPEOD in terms of comfort but is bulkier and harder to move. The most significant edge ILPEOD has is its machine-washable cover‚Äîsomething neither of the competitors offers with ease. While others may have a wider variety of color choices, ILPEOD beats them on practicality and overall build.

**Price Worthiness**

One unexpected surprise was how well this chair performs at its price bracket. Comparable bean bags are often priced much higher but don‚Äôt include adjustable sponge filling or washable covers. It provides excellent value for a product that combines comfort, durability, and premium features. If you‚Äôve been on the fence about investing in a bean bag chair, this one makes the decision easy. The blend of affordability and quality sets it apart in the market.

Using it for cooking food went just fine, but when I used it to cook coffee with a Moka pot standing in one of the pots, the pot got dented and a hole appeared.

I used the stand with the flip hooks, like always, but I am wondering what im doing wrong. Any help is appreciated, as I am inexperienced with using a spirit burner stove.

1mso6zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1mso6zq/tyler_may_have_killed_more_than_one_person/,Tyler may have killed more than one person because of Wednesday.,"Okay, I'm rewatching the series, and the more I watch, the more new things I discover.

I think I just understood the moment Tyler realizes he's Hyde, and that Rowan might not have been the only victim he's claimed because of Wednesday.

https://preview.redd.it/21o542m2ckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=693213aced9770ae49f5c2b032841e2f0c621327

We know that in the first episode, we meet Tyler, the coffee shop barista, the person he really is. He receives help from Wednesday with the coffee machine, then helps her with information and offers to take her to the train station. At that point, Hyde had already claimed three victims, meaning Tyler had already killed three people without knowing it.

https://preview.redd.it/gbcs1ut5ckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=447862e9c49dc627c5cca107de930e5f6e33fde7

The fourth victim becomes Rowan when Wednesday's plan to flee the city fails after she has a vision of his death and tries to save him. As a result, Rowan tries to kill Wednesday, and Tyler appears transformed to save her.

https://preview.redd.it/ouwn9m58ckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c18e1320f3a7ddc5aa0e956276df33def07059

We remember here that at that moment, Tyler didn't know he was Hyde. But his instincts were likely triggered when he saw her in danger. He saved her by killing Rowan, but killing Rowan was what triggered her realization that he was a monster.

https://preview.redd.it/v3tkng09ckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0242e0e21d08384d9bf61cec8bac2ba67ae251e9

In episode 2, we see Wednesday go to the place where Rowan died to find clues, and at that moment, Tyler suddenly appears, saying he was stalking her father after he said he would investigate the crime scene. Wednesday doesn't suspect anything there, but then Tyler starts asking questions, suspicious questions...

""What really happened? What did you see?""

He was slightly worried about what Wednesday might have seen, but also about what clues his father would find.

https://preview.redd.it/dryuufbackjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=698e7082165f5faa5fe96acc86ac4c7435d37c9b

In episode 3, this is where things get interesting. Wednesday finds clues that lead to the ruins of an abandoned house in Cobham Forest, and she asks Tyler for help finding it. He even jokes about how obsessed she is with the monster (him), but later he offers to take her there, probably wanting to make sure she doesn't see too much.

https://preview.redd.it/ofvpzm2bckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=143cbd748a8f14247e8d2545b5ec12b71579d054

There, she finds the broken-in homeless man. He tries to mess with Wednesday, gets beaten up by Thing, and runs away. But after she has a vision, she wakes up in the rain and hears a noise through a crack, realizing she's being watched by Tyler. He goes to her to check on her.

https://preview.redd.it/woymkgwbckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a01c57b40471ad97206dd39b94f276aa14038b9

Later, the homeless man is murdered by Tyler in the same spot where his images are first captured on camera. *Why him specifically?*

The question may lead to the fact that he was a lone man in the middle of the woods, an easy victim, but it's something to really think about.

https://preview.redd.it/xk1upnadckjf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=53ee74fe0f32358151b99cd2855c0007342704a9

And then there's the scene with Tyler in the bathtub. Here we already have the full knowledge that he knows he's Hyde, and... well, he wasn't handling it well. The analogy of making him scream underwater refers to the suffocating secret he harbors, the weight of the lives he's taken, even if some may have been worth it.",6,1755429240.0,weyler,1,0.88,False

We visited a lot of places. 
Day 1: RK Beach, Ramakrishna Beach, CMR Mall and  some nearby places.
Day 2: Ross Hill Church, Kailasagiri, Tenneti Park.
Day 3: Araku Valley (Borra Caves, Coffee Garden, View Point, Wooden Bridge, Waterfall, Tribal Museum). We wrapped up with RK Beach again to make it memorable before leaving.

And that‚Äôs where the scam happened.

Some photographers at RK Beach approached us and insisted:
üëâ‚ÄúOnly ‚Çπ20 per photo. We‚Äôll click lots, you only keep the ones you like.‚Äù
Sounded harmless, so we agreed. He clicked tons of pictures without telling us how many. Later, each of us picked around 5‚Äì7 pics (plus a few group photos), so overall 35‚Äì40 pics.

Then came the twist. Instead of giving only the selected pics, he transferred 150 photos to my friend‚Äôs phone and demanded ‚Çπ3000  (for literally sending photos online). We argued that we only selected a few, so how can it suddenly become 150 when we deleted so many? But he kept pushing, got aggressive, and even called more people to pressure us.

The argument went on for 15 minutes. Finally, after a lot of back-and-forth, he forced us to keep 80 photos and demanded payment. Since they knew we had a train in 2 hours, they used that against us. We somehow negotiated it down to ‚Çπ1300 (still a lot for a student budget), paid, and left with a bad taste in our mouth.

So yeah‚ÄîVisakhapatnam is a beautiful city, but beware of the beach photographers at RK Beach. What starts as ‚Äú‚Çπ20 per photo‚Äù can easily turn into a mini-extortion scam.",15,1755429049.0,india,2,0.94,False

1mso40o,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mso40o/suggestions_on_setup_for_broad_range_of_brewing/,Suggestions on setup for broad range of brewing styles,"Hello everyone, after some time lurking and appreciating the expertise around, I'd like to tap into the knowledge of the community!

Setup: I have a Breville Barista Pro (of which I use the integrated grinder), which gives me an espresso I now like (it took a few days back then to figure it out). I had a separate Baratza Virtuoso+ for everything else, which worked really well. I had to depart from the grinder (as a gift), so now I can only grind for espresso.

Need: I like changing my brew depending on days, weather, and whatnot. Espresso, moka, V60, french press being the most frequent. Counter space is limited (Breville + Virtuoso being the upper limit). I am not too particular, I aim to good coffee, not perfection. I won't do single dosing most of the times, only occasionally.

QUESTION: Do I have an opportunity to upgrade and/or reduce counter space?

Possible scenarios I see are:

1- Keep the Breville Barista Pro, and get another grinder for non-espresso. An Ode Fellow 2 or similar grinder could work.

2- Change the Breville Barista Pro for something more compact, without integrated grinder (e.g. Bambino or else). Add a grinder that can give me the whole range for my uses, possibly an improvement over the Breville Barista Pro integrated grinder for espresso. I could see e.g. a Baratza Fort√® AP on FB marketplace near me, but I can consider a Vario W+ or similar ""broad range"" grinders.

Budget is not a big concern, but it should kind of make sense for me! E.g. not aiming for perfection, single dosing, exact dial-in for every shot of espresso. But good coffee and an efficient workflow, always.

What is your recommendation for the setup in my use case, and the related machines?

The mechanism employs a spring-loaded or ratcheting system that automatically adjusts to the diameter of the vessel, ensuring a snug and secure fit. Premium models can adapt to containers ranging from 2.5 inches to 4 inches in diameter, making them incredibly versatile.

the adjustable grip is often constructed from durable,non-slip materials such as TPR (thermoplastic rubber) or silicone. These materials not only provide a secure hold but also protect the container from scratches and dents. the design prioritizes ease of use, allowing for one-handed operation when inserting or removing a drink.

**Integrated Insulation:** Maintaining the temperature of your beverage is a crucial function of a quality drink holder. Integrated insulation utilizes materials like double-walled stainless steel or high-density foam to minimize heat transfer. This keeps cold drinks colder and hot drinks hotter for extended periods.

Double-walled stainless steel models often incorporate a vacuum-sealed design, further enhancing their insulation capabilities. High-density foam offers a more lightweight and budget-friendly alternative, providing effective insulation for shorter durations. The effectiveness of the insulation is typically measured by the rate of temperature change per hour, with premium models exhibiting minimal fluctuation.

**Universal Mounting System:** A versatile mounting system is essential for adapting the drink holder to various environments.Universal mounting systems often employ adjustable clamps, suction cups, or adhesive pads that can be securely attached to a wide range of surfaces. These systems are designed to be non-marking and easy to install and remove without damaging the underlying surface.

The adjustability of the mounting system allows for optimal positioning of the drink holder, ensuring easy access and preventing obstructions. Premium systems may include swivel joints or rotating platforms, providing even greater flexibility in placement and orientation.

**Spill-Proof design:** Preventing spills is arguably the most critical function of a drink holder. Spill-proof designs incorporate features such as deep wells, raised edges, and secure locking mechanisms to minimize the risk of accidental tipping or splashing. The overall design ensures a stable and balanced platform for your beverage, even when subjected to sudden movements or vibrations.

The materials used in spill-proof designs are often water-resistant and easy to clean, further enhancing their practicality. Advanced models may incorporate self-sealing lids or internal baffles that prevent liquid from sloshing out during transit.

Key features of the top drink holders in 2025 include:

* Adjustable grip technology

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal 34 oz cup should possess a combination of features that ensure durability,functionality,and convenience. Factors such as insulation, material, lid design, and portability all contribute to the overall value and user experience.**Insulation Technology:** Stainless steel, vacuum-insulated cups are the dominant selection for users who want to enjoy hot drinks for longer or ice-cold drinks without them getting warm too quickly. The type of steel used is also significant; look for 18/8 stainless steel, known for its resistance to corrosion and its neutral taste, which prevents flavors from lingering. The best cups commonly use a double-walled vacuum insulation system offering up to 24-hour cold and 12-hour hot retention.

**Material Composition:** beyond stainless steel, some 34 oz cups are made from BPA-free Tritan plastic, a durable and shatter-resistant material for consumers who are seeking a lighter option. Tritan is also known for its clarity, resembling glass which can be appealing to some people. Though, always verify that any plastic components are free from harmful chemicals and built to withstand daily use.

**Lid Design and Sealing:** The choice of lid can greatly enhance convenience of use. Spill-proof lids with secure closures are considered essential, notably for those who are commonly traveling. Some alternatives include straw lids with removable straws for easy washing and those with integrated handles or carabiner clips for attachment to bags. The quality and sealing effectiveness are major determinants of leak prevention.

**Ergonomics and Portability:** A 34 oz cup can be slightly bulky,so ergonomic design is crucial. A cup with a tapered shape or a contoured grip will be easier to hold, especially when full. Check the dimensions of the cup, looking at whether it can easily fit in standard cup holders of cars, and if there is a built-in carry handle for simpler carrying.

**Durability and Construction:** the overall construction of the cup plays a significant role in its longevity. stainless steel cups should comprise thick gauge steel, while plastic cups should have reinforced walls to prevent cracking or breaking. Seamless construction can also enhance durability by reducing the likelihood of leaks or fractures.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** The ease of cleaning is a practical consideration. Cups with wide mouths are easier to clean by hand,while those that are dishwasher-safe provide extra convenience. Check if the lid disassembles easily for thorough cleaning to prevent the buildup of mold or bacteria.

A high-quality 34 oz cup provides numerous benefits, ranging from improved hydration to cost savings.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** By using a reusable 34 oz cup, consumers can significantly reduce their reliance on disposable plastic bottles. This lowers plastic waste, contributing to overall environmental sustainability and reducing the amount of pollution in landfills and oceans.

**Cost Savings:** While high-quality cups can cost more upfront, they provide long-term cost savings by eliminating the ongoing need to purchase bottled water or disposable cups. over months and years, the cost of the cup is easily offset by the savings on disposable alternatives.

**Convenience and Portability:** The 34 oz cup is specifically designed to be portable and suitable for a variety of settings. Whether someone is at the gym, in the office, or traveling, the cup's size and design make it easy to carry and use, promoting hydration and comfort wherever they go.

## FAQs Section

Consumers seeking to invest in a 34 oz cup frequently have questions about compatibility, maintenance, and durability.

**Is a 34 oz cup too big to fit in my car's cup holder?**
The compatibility with car cup holders varies depending on the cup design. Check the base diameter of the cup and compare it to the dimensions of your vehicle's cup holder. Many cups are designed with a tapered base to fit standard cup holders, but larger or oddly shaped cups may not.

**How often should I clean my 34 oz cup, and what's the best way to clean it?**
For hygiene reasons, you should clean your cup daily, especially if it is used for beverages other than water. most stainless steel cups can be washed in the dishwasher,while plastic cups should be washed by hand with warm,soapy water. Use a bottle brush to reach all interior surfaces.Disassemble the lid and clean all components thoroughly to prevent the buildup of mold or bacteria.

**what is the lifespan of a high-quality 34 oz cup, and does the warranty cover any potential issues?**
A well-maintained, high-quality 34 oz cup can last for many years with proper care. Stainless steel cups tend to be more durable than plastic alternatives.

1msnpiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1msnpiy/am_i_in_the_wrong_im_at_my_breaking_point_with_my/,Am I in the wrong? I‚Äôm at my breaking point with my relationship.,"I (24F) been with my boyfriend for about 7 years, and we have a 12-month-old baby together. Our relationship has always had issues, but I feel it has reached an all-time low. I want to share the facts as clearly as I can and also include my own flaws, so I‚Äôm asking for honest advice about whether I‚Äôm overreacting, if I‚Äôm the problem, or if this is truly unhealthy.¬†

Currently, I just want to take my son and leave. We live with my parents; I have nowhere to go; I live paycheck to paycheck and places around here are not an option for me, not even the cheapest places. I can‚Äôt go to a hotel for a few nights even if I saved because we both work from home so I won‚Äôt be able to get all my baby needs without him noticing. I know it‚Äôs wrong to want to do this, and maybe even illegal, but I‚Äôm desperate, and just want to clear this fog from my brain so that I know what to do.¬†

I can‚Äôt break up with him because I‚Äôve tried, for years, and he refuses to go. I mean this literally. I would break up with him, stand my ground, waiting for him to pack up and leave. But he would stay in my parents home, silent, and just never leave. Then, he would sleep over because he refused to leave the house. He would keep me awake until 3AM or later, hurling insults, until he comes up with some sad story apology, and because I‚Äôm just too tired, I would give in. If I don‚Äôt give in, the next day and the next night are the same: Insults. Apology. Repeat.

So, I‚Äôm writing this post to get an outside perspective, because if I‚Äôm the wrong one, I‚Äôll work to better myself and stay. But, if what I‚Äôm feeling is right, I have to do something. So, here‚Äôs a summary of faults, sort of.

From the beginning, there were warning signs. Early in the relationship, I had a very close friend, Damien. We weren‚Äôt romantically involved, just really good friends who exchanged selfies and messages.¬†

Now, I promise on all things I love, that this WAS NOT a relationship that was flirty or going anywhere, the messages were like those between two girl friends who liked boys. Nothing romantic, no weird messages, and there was never any selfie or photo that was spicy or weird, literal face selfies or photos of landscapes, random things like coffee, or photos you‚Äôd find on a boring Facebook account.¬†

We weren‚Äôt dating long, but by that time, I hadn‚Äôt talked to Damien much, because I was focused on this new relationship of mine.¬† My boyfriend freaked out over a selfie of him, and demanded that I end the friendship right there or he‚Äôd leave. I did it so quickly and harshly. I regret this because I did it that way. He was truly a great person, and he didn‚Äôt deserve that. I was afraid of being left or treated the way my last relationship was, so I did it without much thought. To this day, I hate that I did that.

Though, this wasn‚Äôt a one-time thing. He would tell me to stop messaging some people here and there over time, but the one time stuck out. My best friend for years was messing up in her life, and she had cheated on her boyfriend by falling for a guy she worked with and ended up kissing him. My best friend and I were talking about this as an issue, not a slay-moment. But while I slept at like 1AM or something, he would take my phone and send the most horrid messages and voice notes to my friend.¬†

He did this, demanded she tell her boyfriend, insulted her in ways that were not acceptable or honorable (no matter what she did), and then blocked her after he deleted the conversation. I lost her just like that, and with a ‚Äúshe‚Äôs trash‚Äù and ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt associate with people like that‚Äù, I was left in a space where I had lost another friend, and I was too tired and scared to talk to other people like I did before. Today, I don‚Äôt have anyone: No friends, only talk to my parents, which as I will tell later, isn‚Äôt supportive in the leaving. But like I said, that‚Äôs later, and I first want to cover the early issues.

The major issue that bumped into 6 months of our relationship was a disgusting lie. Before we dated, we knew of one another for several years. On his Facebook back then, I saw a 2D baby scan on his page, and from the comments, I noted that he was the father.¬†

At the beginning of us seeing one another, I waited for him to bring it up, but he never did. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded to be a stepmother, so I just waited for him to bring this up, knowing these things take time. After a long wait, I brought this up.

When I had asked him about this, he told me that the girl had an unfortunate miscarriage. Forward 6 months, I went through his phone (I know I shouldn‚Äôt as it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy, but I felt I needed clarity and peace, and I did it shamefully).¬†

There it was, messages between him and his ex, and the supposed miscarriage was a lie, she had a baby boy. In these chats, he had helped her with food, talked about caring for the child, and this and that. He maintains the child is not his, and that she had cheated on him with his roommate. That he had, along with his parents, asked for a paternity test multiple times which she refused. So, he says the child is not his and he knows it. 	

Never once in the messages were there discussions about the child not being his or anything signalling this dispute. The problem is that, at the time when he told me the tale of her cheating and that, I believed him. But now, and for some time now, I have my doubts.¬†

Every other year, she reaches out demanding child care, but I looked her up recently and she looks happy with her new man, the boy is healthy, and I am glad for her. I don‚Äôt think he is honest about this, honestly. I don‚Äôt know, and I would never ask her for a paternity test. It is not my place, and he refuses to contact her. The miscarriage lie was where the trust was broken, and I don‚Äôt think I ever got it back, but I stayed because I‚Äôm¬† a joke, I guess.

I have resentment, clearly, and this is why I can‚Äôt trust my judgement and why I‚Äôm asking advice.

I also can‚Äôt ask his parents, because I know he lies to them, too, as he has done so before my eyes multiple times before. From small things to big: Like the other day, he sent his brother a gift on twitch and when his father asked whose account it was, while I was saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs mine‚Äù he was quick to interrupt and say that it was his money. He also tells his father it‚Äôs him paying for various things like helping them out when I‚Äôm the one using my last money to do so. He also tells them he doesn‚Äôt smoke or drink, which is a lie. The money thing I can excuse, as I know some men find this embarrassing or an ego-hit or something.

But he lies, frequently, both about small and big things, and he lies too easily for my liking, and I‚Äôve made this very clear to him and how much I hate it. This is why, even though I can find excuses for him, I still view them as issues, because all these little lies are a part of a big problem.

One of his little-lie-habits that really urged resentment is that he often borrows ideas, opinions, and stories from others and media (like movies or a YouTube video) and presents them as his own. I used to love his views and big ideas, but the more I watched things with him and the more I observed, I started to think ‚Äúdoes he even have a mind or thought of his own?‚Äù This is a thing that was big for me and the big reason why I held this resentment, it put me off - him lying about the miscarriage and then noticing the lies he did so effortlessly in front of everyone, then he would grin proudly like he was so smart or creative. It was and is weird.¬†

The stories he stole were clear, as each time he would tell the same story, it would be happening to another person (not him anymore), or there would be a big change, like something that happened to him was now something he saw in a movie. He lies so much that he cannot remember his own lies,his reality or history is something I don‚Äôt know anymore because it was never his. It‚Äôs hard to trust what he says, and when he says something I often find myself thinking ‚Äúis this even true.‚Äù¬†

I know he might have a bad memory, but like a year or two ago I started correcting his lies. When he says an idea that was stolen I would say ‚Äúoh like this YouTuber said‚Äù or when he tells a story I would say ‚Äúoh but last time you said this‚Äù. And he would laugh uncomfortably, tell me to shh, or along those lines because we were in front of people. I know it‚Äôs bad of me to humiliate him like this, but I am desperate for these lies to end, especially when I had my baby.

Another thing, related to the lying and connected to another issue is his boundaries with women and his failure to own up.

He has issues with boundaries, particularly regarding other women. He frequently likes multiple photos of other women on social media, including my brother‚Äôs ex-girlfriend. With my brother‚Äôs girlfriends, he oscillates between insulting them when we are alone and overly engaging with them when they visit, which I find uncomfortable and confusing. I do admit to having a jealous-streak and self-esteem issues, so perhaps I‚Äôm misreading it, but I don‚Äôt think I am.

The liking of my brother's ex photos: He is always like this with my brother's gf - he would talk bad about them when we are alone, but when they are over he goes out of his way to talk to them, make fun of them playfully, or to interact with them in whatever way. For example, with the new gf of my brother, whenever they are over, he would see me struggling with the baby and leave me to struggle alone while he must be present there (there are other people there, as stated we live with my parents).¬†

He notices how and what and when she eats, he keeps on making jokes that are insulting but playful, if that makes sense. With my brother's previous girlfriend he asked her why the father of her baby wasn't present. After sharing her story, which I won't share, he looked at her deeply, and whispered, ""he doesn't need his dad"".¬†

She was uncomfortable and so was I because even though this might come forth as a nice gesture, the build-up of him asking the same question again and again in front of other people was weird.

Another ex of my brother had asked me to go the mall with her, I was feeling stressed and sick, and didn‚Äôt want to go. I asked if he could mention me having to do something (I realized back then that it was probably better to just be honest with her because it would‚Äôve been better, and I‚Äôll never do something like this again). Because he said sure, but when we got back to where she was seated he shouted ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want to go with you‚Äù and laughed loudly. I will never forget the pain in her face, and I feel so guilty for this cowardness of mine and hate what he did.

He's always trying extra hard to connect with these girls on another level, on a level where I am annoyed by him and sometimes by these girls. However, I've only been in 2 relationships, and the previous one did not leave any room for trust, so I could just be jealous and dramatic.

Though, he has broken trust in this department, too. In person, he has flirted with women and even touched a woman inappropriately at a party:¬†

My bf had a business partner and they all went out partying one night, as always I was left at home. The next day when he returned after 10AM, a message popped up on his phone from his business partner. Apparently his (the business partner's) brother‚Äôs girlfriend complained to his brother and the business partner about my partner touching her butt the entire night.¬†

When I confronted my bf, he said she made it up and that she was, in fact, the one that tried something with him, and that she had made up the story because he rejected her. I never believed him and he knew this, 100%.¬† But I would bring this up and he would either ignore it, call me insane, or say that I‚Äôve cheated on him before because I was sending selfies and messages to Damien. This is a bad argument on his part because it was not cheating. Now, we see messaging and post-liking and such as cheating, but back then we discussed that this was okay. Today, I don‚Äôt have any contact with males, even if it‚Äôs a family friend, while he does talk to multiple women.

Now, something I mentioned was that I was left at home again. Something happened. He often doesn‚Äôt want me to accompany him when he goes out, and if I do, he encourages me to leave early and becomes unpleasant until I do. This isn‚Äôt really an issue today because when he goes out, it‚Äôs usually to a friend's house now or if he goes out drinking, I would rather stay in and care for my baby.

But before, it was weird.¬† One day when we were out, he had asked me to go home repeatedly - this was my brother's birthday and he kept nagging me to go home the whole night, eventually I caved. But that's not the worst memory of that night.¬†

There was this girl who flirted with my father and said insulting things about my mother. I hated her instantly because of this because she had no right to insult my mother and try her luck with my dad.¬†

We were chatting to the regular waitress who was off that night and was friends with this chick. Then while we were still talking this girl turns around and says ""we have actual jobs"" for some reason. I am a ghostwriter and manager for a SEO agency. This fumed the fire already burning inside of me.¬†

Then later on, she tried talking bad about me to my brother, not knowing he was my brother. I was fuming more and delighted to see that look on her face when she realized he was my brother and that I was standing next to them while she had her attempt.¬†

That night, after feeling overwhelmed by my beef with this girl and my bf constant ""you should go home"" ""you can go home"" ""I think it's best to go home as people are drunk and it's late"" I went home.¬†

That night he did not come home, instead he partied at multiple places with my brother, his friends, the waitress, and this girl. Only came home the next day at like 10 or 2 - I can't remember because him partying, telling me he is coming home and to wait up, and then only coming home the next day (after having me wait until 3am before telling me he is sleeping over at his friends home, it's hard to remember).¬†

He did this a lot, and still does this today. He would go out, tell me he‚Äôd be back at like 10PM, that time will come and go, then it‚Äôs 11PM, he would tell me he‚Äôs getting an uber, an hour would pass, then at 1 or 3AM, he would say he‚Äôs sleeping over, see tomorrow. So, I waited up for nothing.

He was in 2 fights while going out with my brother and his friends. He would come back and tell me tales. One night he came back and his shirt was ripped from his body. He told me some guy wanted to fight him because of something (I can‚Äôt remember the reason he gave) and that was it. A few months later I found out it was because he was catcalling and hitting on the guy‚Äôs girlfriend repeatedly, as well as other women at the bar.

There are a lot of issues on my mind, his usual strategy is to insult me or ignore me, so this build-up resentment and lack of communication and closure is likely to cause of me wanting to leave, I think.¬†

But bear with me as I‚Äôll try to outline everything quickly, though writing this out feels really good. The next bits will probably just be points that don‚Äôt flow and chronologically make sense because I‚Äôm trying to save you from reading a book while getting out everything I can.

My final straw was when I was pregnant. He would party every chance he gets, telling me this is because he‚Äôs becoming a dad. Firstly, he still goes out alone regularly to bars and to his friends house. When my father suggests they babysit and the two of us go out eating together he states ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go anywhere where I can‚Äôt go with my baby‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do anything if my baby isn‚Äôt coming along‚Äù. Now, this is fine, I mean, I miss my baby within minutes and would rather spend time with my baby over him anyway. But it‚Äôs the hypocrisy that gets me. He says those things when it‚Äôs about me getting a break, but jumps when it‚Äôs him having fun.

My baby shower was also a dramatic shift in my feelings (that were left) for him. I am an extremely self-conscious and shy person, even in front of my family, except my mom, dad, and siblings, mostly. My family is huge however. Along with his family, and some family friends, we had around 85 people present for a shared baby shower.¬†

Before we even got there, I told him that he can have fun and entertain guests as much as he liked, but I begged that he just do the present opening with me because it terrified me to be sitting in front of so many people opening gifts because 1. As mentioned I‚Äôm shy, and 2. Receiving gifts (no matter what it is) always overwhelms me with so much guilt that I don‚Äôt know how to react. So, 2 of my biggest fears in one sitting. It was terrifying and because my mother was drinking, eventually I was alone up there opening these gifts. Now, I am extremely grateful for the amount of gifts but it was a lot.¬†

So, we even took a break for me to go to the bathroom. I went and sobbed because it felt like my heart was breaking out of my chest, and I took that time to beg him to stay for a while for the last gifts opening, but he did only for a minute probably before leaving me alone again. He was wasted. On top of that, as mentioned my mother was drinking, so all of the baby shower games were abandoned randomly in the middle of everything which was highly embarrassing and made me feel horrible. I am very thankful for my 2 cousins who saw my distress and helped me out in the end. I love them and will forever remember their help.

It was honestly not a baby shower I wanted. At that time I was making minimum wage, but was able to save up a huge amount for the baby shower because I wanted to go all in. The day I was so excited about was a mess, so big that I drove home in tears. I went straight to bed and cried. Though, the day wasn‚Äôt over. I was 7 months along and huge in my pregnancy, and my back was killing me, and my feet were swollen so much. It had gotten to the point where already I was struggling to get out of bed and could barely sleep because I wasn‚Äôt able to roll over without pain and couldn‚Äôt get out of bed myself (not a pretty pregnancy, but at least my baby was perfectly healthy).¬†

That night, my back got stuck, I couldn‚Äôt move, and I messaged him non-stop. He was partying with his friends, and sleeping over again. I begged him to come home and help me because everyone else was drunk and asleep. I was alone. He said ‚Äúeh what you mean‚Äù and that he was ‚Äúsupporting me‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt need support from afar, I needed someone to help me get out of bed so I could use the bathroom. I ended up falling asleep and was able to get out of bed the next day.

For the birth, he did not come into the OR because he was scared (asked my mom to be there last minute while I was filling out paperwork), so my mother came along. Though, he was very helpful during my time in the hospital: He was there early and stayed all day until visiting hours were over. This was very helpful because I had to stay in the hospital for 3 days because I was a new mom and my baby was not sleeping at all.¬†

I would feed him, and when I would put him down he would scream instantly again. It was only on the day we were leaving that we learned my milk supply was not enough for him at all. I was furious as I had no idea what I was doing. My mother never got any milk with us so I had no idea what breastfeeding was about. I feel horrible knowing I wasn‚Äôt giving my baby enough food for 3 whole days. Though, as I said, he did well here. He was supportive.¬†

But, whenever I tell him about my disappointment of him not being there for the delivery he says that ‚Äúwell, I was there afterwards, so‚Äù which is more of a bummer than issue.

Now. regarding my baby now: I work late hours. Mornings are particularly difficult for me. I go to bed around 1 AM and wake to care for the baby until around 3 AM. I have sleep issues: I sometimes wake partially, don‚Äôt fully remember waking, and often fall asleep immediately again.¬†

From 5 to 8 AM, he is responsible for the baby, but he wakes me constantly, insults me, or yells, which affects my sleep. From 8 AM to 12 PM, I take care of the baby, but struggle to stay awake and connect due to my exhaustion.¬†

From 12 to 4 PM, I work, often falling behind, which adds stress. I handle diapers, help during calls, and step in when he cannot manage naps or other tasks. From 4 to 6/7 PM, I care for the baby again, including feeding, bathing (with my mother‚Äôs help), and bedtime. From around 6/7 PM to midnight, I work and tend to the baby, who sometimes wakes multiple times. I usually go to bed around midnight or 1 AM, but often work until 3 AM while caring for the baby. My daily required hours are 8 hours, but I work 12 hours just to make up those 8 hours, but recently I can only manage to do around 6. I fear that I will lose my job because of this, and I am the only one making enough money to handle all of our expenses consistently.

He has his own business and works while I take care of the baby, he refuses to work at night as he want to watch TV, spend time with his friend (the one he sleeps over at often is here every night and every weekend), or he wants to sleep (usually 9PM or 10PM).

My partner does help, like sterilizing bottles at night and caring for the baby from 5 to 8 AM, though he often delegates responsibilities to me when his friend is over, especially on weekends. Because he claims it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy turn‚Äù on the weekends, but I still work on weekends at night to make up for me falling behind, and he doesn‚Äôt take my place. So, we are not switching anything, he just rests on weekends while I take over.

Now, I do understand his frustration with me in the mornings as my way of sleeping is something I‚Äôm genuinely ashamed about. The whole thing where I sleep so deeply that I don‚Äôt wake for noises, or where I will basically ‚Äúsleepwalk‚Äù and do things is a genuine concern. I would wake up, pick my baby up and put him in bed and have no recollection of doing so.

One incident that caused a lot of tension was when our baby accidentally rolled off the bed because of my sleepwalking or whatever it is called. I was right there and reacted quickly, but it still happened. He wasn‚Äôt seriously hurt, luckily, but it was a very scary moment. My partner‚Äôs instinct was not to jump up and help, but to jump up and insult me and yell at me. The entire rest of the day I was insulted and screamed at. He was scared, I get that, but I was also scared, and I felt guilty, and hearing how I am a ""terrible mother who cannot be trusted with my baby alone‚Äù hurts and I believe it because I hear so often. But I know I‚Äôm not a horrible mother, either. It‚Äôs conflicting.¬†

Though, he says we aren‚Äôt allowed to make ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù as parents. Though, his mistakes I understand and help with. I cannot do anything wrong or that he disagrees with. He‚Äôs honestly made being a mom horrible, and I‚Äôm constantly so overstressed and tired from work, too.¬†

To ensure my baby‚Äôs safety, I have put our mattress on the floor and ensured the room is baby-proof. I still get insulted because of my sleep issue, but at least my baby is safe. Though, I must sort this sleep-thing out as I‚Äôm losing precious time with my baby, and he could still fall because I wasn‚Äôt looking and because I was asleep. This is my mission now, I‚Äôm just worried it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm working odd hours and overstressed. I also consume a lot of energy drinks, which I think doesn‚Äôt help (I‚Äôve always been such a heavy weird sleeper, but I do think they contribute to the issue.) But I have gone down with my consumption and hope to not consume them soon. I also want to figure out why my sleep is like this and how the hell I can get it better.

Our household situation complicates things. We live with my parents, who have a large dog, making baby-proofing difficult. The baby is mostly confined to one room, which has a TV. I‚Äôve asked my partner to reduce TV use, but he reacts negatively and insults me, keeping it on and letting the baby play mostly alone while he watches or is on his phone.¬†

He says that I‚Äôm being bossy by asking for a reduced screen time, and the insults continue because I‚Äôm just someone who googles too much, and google doesn't know anything. But I‚Äôm a ghostwriter and not an idiot, I know where to look for credible sources and I don‚Äôt jump at the first article I see without ensuring it‚Äôs in a study of some sorts. His word is the final say.¬†

The baby favors him over me, crying when I take him or hold him, which hurts deeply. I often feel resentful and embarrassed about my own exhaustion and sleep struggles, which may impact my ability to bond.

I recognize my own flaws. I struggle with organization,, and I don‚Äôt always clean up after myself when I‚Äôm truly busy, like I will hold my baby for hours trying to do something with the other hand, and when my one hand goes numb, I‚Äôll tell myself I‚Äôll close that bottle cap later and sometimes forget. I like to clean in one sitting, which he cannot fathom. Calling me a dirty pig and all that. But honestly, I‚Äôm always thinking about work and how far I am behind, how a project is due and I‚Äôm late again. He brings this up often and I feel like a horrible mother because I must be neat and organized.¬†

I have anger issues and sometimes hold my feelings in until they explode‚ÄîI scream, curse, and insult him when he does this to me for hours. I am reactively abusive, and I snap at him. I think that the only way to stop this is to remove him from my life because he doesn‚Äôt stop, even when I try to remain calm and silent, it doesn‚Äôt stop. I just want to be a mother without feeling on edge. I just want to feel supported and I want to stop being insulted and feel bad about myself.¬†

I want to be healthy but my mind is honestly fried. It‚Äôs torment that I cannot explain to someone. I‚Äôm alone in this because my parents take his side because he lies, and I‚Äôm the one reacting and screaming while he insults silently and screams when we are alone. My baby likes him more because he is able to spend more time with him while I work, and he isn‚Äôt stressed or on edge like me, and I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs angry all the time because he treats me like this and insults me and all I do. Why wouldn‚Äôt my baby choose him? He‚Äôs not a bad father, though. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad mom, but he says I am, and then he goes around saying I‚Äôm a great mom. I am so tired.

My mindset now is that I don‚Äôt want this, and I don‚Äôt want my baby to be the man my partner is, but I can‚Äôt get away. I won‚Äôt ever keep my baby from his father, though. He‚Äôs not a bad dad, like I said, I just don‚Äôt want my baby to lie and treat women the way my partner does, and I‚Äôm afraid that my baby will believe the insults of my partner.

I am sharing all of this because I want people to help me understand if I am overreacting, if I am truly at fault, or if this relationship is unhealthy and potentially unsafe for me and my child. I also want advice on how to navigate caring for my baby while managing exhaustion, resentment, and ongoing conflict with my partner.

Anyway, this has spawned from a conversation I had with a colleague at work who doesn't know our IVF story but recently told me she was pregnant (at like 6 weeks lol, but somehow the people with no anxiety don't seem to experience loss as much but maybe that's just my bitterness talking). I digress, anyway we were talking about our weekends and she said that she had had a lovely weekend and that her best friend had flown into town for them to spend the weekend together. She said that it was a ""gorgeous and emotional time"" and I was like okay? 

She went on to explain that her best friend and her husband had been in fertility treatments for 3 years and they had had a few miscarriages. She said she had been wondering how to tell her friend about her own pregnancy (colleague is not married and it was a bit of an oopsie but her and bf are happy...but I'm not sure a friend would have necessarily seen it coming). Colleague said she wasn't worried about telling her friend ""because she knew she would be thrilled for her no matter what"". Anyway since her friend was coming to see her in person she ""held out spilling the beans even though it was killing her"" so she could surprise her (meanwhile this chick is only like 9 weeks btw). She waits until her friend arrives and then leads her to the guest room where she has set up this whole elaborate ""surprise"" with balloons and a baby onsie and an ultrasound pic and THE POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST and a sign that says ""will you be my godmother?"" She was so pleased with herself telling me this story and I was just like, this would have been my actual worst nightmare. To be separated from my husband and be with someone so daft as to think making me a godmother would heal my infertility pain!

Phew! It makes me mad just thinking about it! (Also apparently the friend had to go home half a day earlier bc of work but I wonder if she just couldn't handle it). Anyway a friendly reminder to TEXT YOUR FRIENDS AND NOT TO AMBUSH THEM!

I think you can do things like become a godmother during infertility but it's a delicate time and those feelings are much better processed where you can be alone for a bit!

Anyway! Maybe some of ya'll feel differently but I am so confused that SO many people think that they ""should"" tell their friends face to face when we already live in a pretty text based culture! I have had ppl break up with me via text! Yet somehow every single woman I went to college with wants to get coffee to tell me they are with child!",34,1755427085.0,IVF,8,0.89,False

Hi everyone, are there any coffee professionals here that are into running or maybe a person who loves drinking coffee and runs. My major dilemma is that because of my work where I  do quality control in a cafe/Roastery is that I get to drink a lot of coffee, so during my training which happens after my shift, my HR spikes up easily. If I follow my heart rate then I would be jogging at a walking pace and if I follow RPE then my HR shoots up. When I'm running with a friend we keep on talking until the end of the run so I know that I'm jogging at an easy pace. 

Now I would love to know whether I should stick on running/jogging based on RPE or should I base it on my HR while jogging at a walking pace to continue building my base. 

If this can help here are my stats:

Age - 28

Sex - Male

Weight: 85kgs

MPW - 40 to 50km / week 

Pace: easy would range from 9:30/km to 11:00/km at 120 to 150bpm - on days where I drink a lot of coffee, I have to stay at 11-12 min/km

400m below intervals I usually do it at a below 6:00/km pace

600m up at 6:30/km pace

Workouts

Monday - 6km easy 

Tuesday - 4 to 5km easy plus strength

Wednesday - 3km easy + short intervals (100m to 400m x 10 - 12) + 1km recovery

Thursday - 4 to 5km easy plus strength

Friday - 2km easy + long intervals (600m to 1km x 5 or tempo) + 1km recovery 

Saturday - rest

Sunday- 15km LSD

PR: 
5km - 28:42 Average HR: 198 Max:207

10km - 58:26 Average HR:199 Max: 209

21km - 3:03:29

Issue with filters though... i used metal filters when i had a standard aeropress previously, but since getting the premium i have been using papers as i wrongly assumed they were different sizes due to the different dimensions. The papers would frequently get fouled up between the glass and the metal cap, and at best would not work and at worst coffee would go all over the mug and work surface.

I decided to go metal filter and got the aeropress ones this time, but now i get a small amount of spillage every time! At least it's more predictable, but i'd sooner prefer a decent filter solution that doesn't spill. 

I know i can get the flow control cap but it feels a shame to stop using the metal cap that I paid top money for, and I don't really like having to pay money to solve something that should be an issue in the first place.

But¬†even¬†while¬†she¬†was¬†teaching,¬†she¬†kept¬†hearing¬†soft¬†laughs¬†from¬†the¬†

back.¬†

Edgar‚Äôs¬†deep¬†voice¬†and¬†Amelia‚Äôs¬†flirty¬†giggles¬†cut¬†through¬†her¬†like¬†knives.¬†

As¬†soon¬†as¬†the¬†bell¬†rang,¬†Stephanie¬†bolted¬†from¬†the¬†classroom.¬†

She¬†went¬†to¬†the¬†restroom¬†and¬†splashed¬†cold¬†water¬†on¬†her¬†face.¬†When¬†she¬†was¬†about¬†to¬†head¬†out,¬†she¬†heard¬†Amelia¬†talking inside¬†one¬†of¬†the¬†stalls.¬†

‚ÄúEdgar¬†gave¬†up¬†a¬†deal¬†worth¬†ten¬†billion¬†just¬†to¬†be¬†in¬†class¬†with¬†me!‚Äù¬†Amelia¬†bragged¬†on¬†the¬†phone.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†should‚Äôve¬†seen¬†how¬†he¬†looked¬†at¬†me.¬†Like¬†he¬†wanted¬†to¬†devour¬†me.‚Äù¬†

Her¬†friend asked,¬†‚ÄúIf¬†he‚Äôs¬†so¬†into¬†you,¬†why don‚Äôt¬†you¬†just¬†say¬†yes?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAre¬†you¬†kidding?‚Äù¬†Amelia¬†snorted.¬†‚ÄúGuys¬†like¬†him¬†have¬†women¬†chasing¬†them¬†nonstop.¬†The¬†only¬†way¬†to¬†keep him hooked¬†is¬†to¬†be¬†hot and¬†cold.¬†Give¬†him¬†just¬†enough¬†to¬†keep¬†him¬†interested¬†in¬†me.‚Äù¬†

Stephanie¬†stood¬†there,¬†fists¬†clenched¬†so¬†tight¬†her nails¬†dug¬†into¬†her¬†skin.¬†

She¬†just¬†walked¬†out,¬†passing¬†Amelia¬†expressionlessly.¬†

‚ÄúMs.¬†Sanchez?!‚Äù¬†Amelia¬†hurriedly¬†hung¬†up¬†and¬†grabbed¬†Stephanie‚Äôs¬†wrist.¬†‚ÄúWhat¬†did¬†you¬†hear?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI¬†didn‚Äôt hear¬†a¬†thing,‚Äù¬†Stephanie¬†said,¬†pulling¬†away.¬†‚ÄúYour¬†business¬†has¬†nothing¬†to¬†do¬†with me.‚Äù¬†

Amelia¬†looked¬†like¬†she¬†was¬†going¬†to¬†say¬†more,¬†but¬†then¬†she¬†saw¬†Edgar¬†walking¬†toward¬†her.¬†

Her¬†eyes¬†lit¬†up.¬†Instantly,¬†she¬†grabbed¬†Stephanie‚Äôs¬†wrist again¬†and¬†slapped¬†herself¬†hard¬†across¬†the¬†cheek.¬†

Smack!¬†

The¬†sound¬†echoed¬†down¬†the¬†corridor,¬†sharp¬†and¬†clear.¬†

‚ÄúMs.¬†Sanchez‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†Amelia¬†covered¬†her¬†face,¬†her¬†eyes¬†filling¬†with¬†tears.¬†Her¬†voice¬†was¬†shaky¬†and¬†full¬†of¬†grievance.¬†‚ÄúI¬†won‚Äôt¬†go¬†near¬†Mr.¬†Ferguson¬†anymore.¬†Please¬†don‚Äôt¬†be¬†mad‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Edgar¬†stormed¬†over,¬†and¬†his¬†expression¬†darkened.¬†‚ÄúStephanie!¬†Didn‚Äôt¬†I¬†sign¬†the¬†agreement?¬†Why¬†are¬†you¬†still¬†picking¬†on¬†Amelia?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI¬†didn‚Äôt¬†do¬†anything,‚Äù¬†Stephanie¬†said,¬†calm¬†as¬†ever.¬†‚ÄúShe¬†hit¬†herself.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMr.¬†Ferguson‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†Amelia¬†cried¬†and¬†leaned into¬†Edgar‚Äôs¬†arms.¬†‚ÄúMaybe¬†you¬†shouldn‚Äôt¬†chase¬†after¬†me¬†anymore.¬†Ms.¬†Sanchez¬†is¬†so¬†upset.¬†I‚Äôm¬†scared‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

The¬†photo¬†showed¬†Edgar¬†standing¬†downstairs¬†with¬†a¬†bouquet¬†of¬†roses,¬†looking¬†soft¬†and¬†romantic.¬†

Stephanie¬†stared¬†at¬†it¬†and¬†suddenly¬†smiled.¬†Tears¬†fell on¬†the¬†screen.¬†

She¬†got¬†up¬†unsteadily.¬†When¬†she¬†got¬†home,¬†she¬†sat¬†down¬†and¬†typed¬†up¬†a¬†divorce¬†agreement.¬†

Edgar¬†didn‚Äôt¬†show¬†up¬†until¬†later that¬†night.¬†

Stephanie¬†looked¬†up¬†and¬†said¬†calmly,¬†‚ÄúAlright.¬†But¬†you¬†need¬†to¬†sign¬†something.‚Äù¬†

She¬†handed¬†him¬†a document.¬†‚ÄúIt¬†says¬†you‚Äôll¬†come¬†back¬†in¬†ten¬†years.‚Äù¬†

Without¬†even¬†glancing¬†at¬†it,¬†Edgar¬†scribbled¬†his¬†signature.¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòIs¬†that¬†enough¬†for you?‚Äù¬†he¬†asked,¬†leaning¬†in¬†for¬†a¬†kiss.¬†

Stephanie¬†turned¬†away¬†and¬†whispered,¬†‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬†

And¬†she¬†meant¬†it.¬†

Because¬†he¬†had¬†no¬†clue that¬†what¬†he¬†signed¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†a¬†promise¬†to¬†return.¬†It¬†was¬†a¬†divorce¬†agreement.¬†

I‚Äôve been backpacking Indonesia for the past few weeks. While on this trip, many people - from passerbyers on the street, kids playing around, shop employees, and anyone in between, will say hi, try to talk to me, or ask for a picture.

At first I thought it was cute, and obliged to some pictures, but since I‚Äôve continued traveling, and gone to even less touristy places, it‚Äôs getting kind of tired for me.

Just now I left my room, and immediately many people are saying hi, asking if I need a ride, asking where I‚Äôm going, trying to talk to me, etc. I arrived at this coffee shop, and the girls are sweet, but once I sat alone and tried to mind my own business, an employee came over and asked if she could take my photo for the business Instagram.

I‚Äôm kind of tired from a long travel day, and not really feeling social, so I declined for the first time. She seemed a bit disappointed but was nice enough. 

I guess I just want to ask AITA for rejecting pictures or ignoring people? It just feels a bit taxing, and I know it‚Äôs just because of my skin color. What have others that have felt with this felt or thought?",1,1755426568.0,solotravel,34,0.52,False
