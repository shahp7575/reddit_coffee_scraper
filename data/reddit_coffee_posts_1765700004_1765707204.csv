**1. I ignored the ""ship fast"" advice**

Everyone says launch in 2 weeks. I didn't. I waited until I was genuinely proud of what I built. Controversial take, but launching something half-baked would have killed my motivation faster than slow progress ever could.

I took 4 months to build my product before launching.

Just me in silence writing code.

That's the hard part, not gonna lie here.

**3. Founder-to-founder beats polished marketing**

I met a guy on a friends making app (He is Korean, I'm German and we both live in Korea). 

December 8   
We matched on an app and decided to meet on the same day. It was framed as a friendly meeting, not an official date. He asked me to get coffee, so we went to a café first. We talked a lot, laughed, and quickly realized we had many things in common and were each other’s type. During coffee, he already asked if I’d like to meet again on December 10. After that, we went for dinner and had a few drinks (but stayed sober). While eating, he suddenly touched my hand and told me I was pretty. Later, we went to a karaoke room. While I was singing one song, he stood behind me, touched my hair, and smiled at me. When we went outside, he looked disappointed and said he didn’t want the evening to end. We took photos together in a photo booth and went for a walk. While walking, he put his hand into my jacket pocket and held my hand. He mentioned that most places on that street were either for couples or restaurants, so I jokingly said, “Shall we pretend to be a couple?” He liked the idea. The connection felt really good, easy conversation, lots in common, good chemistry. He gave me compliments and thanked me for the evening, saying he made a great memory thanks to me. We ended up going to a motel and slept together. When we went to sleep, he asked me to hug and cuddle him. The next morning, until checkout at 11am, he kept pulling my arm around him and wouldn’t leave my side. When we parted at the subway, he thanked me again, texted me when he got home, and even asked where I was and when I’d arrive home. 

December 10   
We met at my place. I cooked for him and we planned to watch a movie together. Before he came, I sent him a photo of the food, and later he told me he showed it to his mom. She complimented my cooking, and he proudly told her that he made a German friend. He even took some food home and ate it with his mom. At my place, he chose a scary movie. During the movie, he held my hand, caressed it, squeezed it when I got scared, and rubbed my arm. Afterward, he felt tired, so we laid down and rested. Again, he took my arm and put it around his body, cuddled tightly, and we slept like that for about two hours. We had dinner, and he kept saying how delicious my food was. After dinner, we cuddled more. He touched my hair, held my face, told me I was pretty, and we slept together again. After that, we cuddled again and watched TV. He left around 10pm because he had work the next day. Before leaving, he gave me a big hug.   
  
December 12   
We met again at my place. I cooked, and he said it was the best food he’s ever had. We watched TV and cuddled for about an hour. Then he suddenly brought up “what we are.” He said that I'm totally his type but he hasn’t thought of me as more than a friend yet, and asked if it would be okay if we didn’t have a relationship and just met casually as friends or friends with benefits. He emphasized the “yet,” which confused me even more. He also told me that he deleted the app where we met. Apparently, because he doesn't use the app anyway.   
We talked more and ended up agreeing on clear FWB “rules”:   
• hanging out outside as friends   
• doing fun activities together   
• having sex   
• only sleeping with each other and not meeting other sex partners   
  
I told him I didn’t necessarily mind FWB (I’ve done FWB once before) but honestly? That experience was much more casual. There was no constant cuddling, no romantic gestures, and no emotional closeness like this. That same day, we slept together again, spent the evening cuddling, kissing, watching movies, and went to bed together.   
  
The next morning, he was supposed to go to his academy for test prep, but he skipped it just to stay with me longer. Is this normal?   
  
Another thing that confuses me: When we chat, he always asks about my day, whether I slept well, and he shares details about his own day too. He tells me when he arrives at work, when he finishes, what he’s doing throughout the day, and when he’s going to bed. This feels emotionally attentive and consistent, which doesn’t align with what I personally understand an FWB dynamic to be. 

My questions:   
• Is this actually normal FWB behavior?   
• Is exclusivity + emotional closeness still considered FWB?   
• Why would someone delete the app, act this affectionate, and still say they don’t want a relationship?   
• Does he want a relationship without being aware of it?   
  
I'm not looking for a relationship with him or anything. It's just that his behaviour makes me confused. I’d really appreciate honest opinions. Thank you :)",1,1765706227.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False
1pmagu6,https://i.redd.it/brv6a85j657g1.png,"Где пьют чай, а где кофе? Карта мировых вкусов","По [данным](https://www.fao.org/markets-and-trade/commodities-overview/beverages/tea/en) Международной организации по кофе (ICO), ежегодное мировое потребление превышает 170 миллионов мешков кофе, причем европейские страны остаются лидерами по объему кофе на душу населения. Особенно выделяются государства Северной Европы: так жители Финляндии в среднем пьют почти по четыре чашки в день на человека.

Тем не менее чаем остается самым потребляемым горячим напитком в мире. Исследования Продовольственной и сельскохозяйственной организации ООН (FAO) показали, что глобальное потребление чая продолжает расти — в первую очередь благодаря Китаю, Индии и другим азиатским рынкам, где чай глубоко укоренен в культурных традициях.

Эта мировая «разделенность» отчетливо заметна на карте: Северная Америка, большая часть Южной Америки и Западная Европа отдают явное предпочтение кофе, тогда как Азия, Африка, Восточная Европа и Ближний Восток остаются верны чаю.

Великобритания и Ирландия сохраняют свой традиционный статус главных «чайных» стран Европы, тогда как Бразилия и США укрепляют себя в роли экономик, ориентированных на кофе.

Недавние климатические изменения в странах — основных производителях кофе, таких как Бразилия (заморозки) и Эфиопия (неустойчивая сезонность осадков), привлекли внимание к уязвимости глобальных цепочек поставок напитков.

Одновременно меняется и поведение потребителей. Международный торговый центр отмечает, что молодые покупатели все чаще уделяют внимание устойчивости производства, этичному происхождению и качеству: будь то кофе одного региона или ремесленные сорта чая. Эти предпочтения меняют то, как бренды продвигают свои продукты и как потребители с ними взаимодействуют.

I never really figured out if I got it wrong, or just didn’t have the words to express what I was feeling.



I know him through friends. Nothing dramatic. We began to chat, small thing mainly at first. Coffee, work, random observations about the city. He was warm in a very direct way — asking questions, laughing easily, looking at me when I spoke. I’m not used to that kind of attention, at least not openly.



Love doesn't look loud Where I come from loving someone doesn’t look loud. It’s quieter. You notice details. You wait. You don’t rush to label anything. If you care,you show it by staying, not telling it.



so when he leaned closer when we spoke, I leaned back a bit — not because I was disinterested, but because that’s how I hold myself steady.

When he asked me what I was thinking, I replied “nothing,” even though My mind was quite full.



I could tell he was trying to read me. Just sometimes he’d pause, as if he was expecting something — a sign, a sentence, anything. wanted to give him that clarity but the words were too heavy to let go each time I made the attempt.

One night, after we said goodbye, he texted me less. Not cold, just less. I told myself, I’m imagining it. A few days later the conversations ceased entirely.

I didn’t reach out. Pride, maybe. Or fear. Or the belief that if someone really wanted to stay, they would know that silence isn’t a sign of rejection.

“Now,” months later, I am still thinking about it. Not obsessively. Just while I’m sitting in those quiet moments when I think about how many relationships, not because there was nothing there, but because two people were speaking different emotional tongues.

I don't know if he thought I wasn’t interested.

I don't know if I thought he would try harder.

1pmabvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/artikle/comments/1pmabvo/hey_rb2b_discovering_a_gamechanger_for_intent/,Hey r/b2b: Discovering a Game-Changer for Intent Data in the European Market – My Take on Artikle.io,"Hey r/b2b,

I've spent the last five years knee-deep in the world of B2B sales tech, testing out intent data platforms from the big names like Bombora, 6sense, and ZoomInfo to more niche ones like Leadfeeder. Time and again, I've hit walls—especially when our team at Innovix Dynamics (a mid-sized SaaS firm focusing on supply chain optimization) started expanding into France and broader EU markets. The usual suspects? Spotty coverage outside the US, GDPR compliance that felt like a minefield, and signals that were more noise than insight.

About six months ago, we pivoted to Artikle.io after a colleague in my LinkedIn network raved about it during a casual chat over coffee (virtually, of course). Elias Voss here, by the way—Director of Business Development at Innovix Dynamics. What sold me initially was hearing from a handful of peers in manufacturing and tech services who were seeing real traction. Turns out, I'm not alone; from what I've gathered in our industry Slack groups and at recent events like SaaStock Europe, dozens of folks are quietly switching over and reporting similar wins.

Fast-forward to today: After integrating it across our ops, it's become our go-to for intent signals, particularly in the EU. Here's why it stands out without the hype:

🇪🇺 Strong EU Footprint, Especially France

Global tools often fizzle out in Europe, but Artikle's got solid coverage for everything from Paris-based enterprises to Lyon-area SMEs in logistics. We've picked up timely alerts on companies researching supply chain AI—stuff we were missing before. It's like they've mapped local data streams deeply; no more blind spots in French or German markets.

🛡️ GDPR-First Approach

Compliance was a non-negotiable for us, given our EU push. Artikle handed over airtight docs during onboarding, all processed server-side in the EU with company-aggregate data only. No red flags in our legal review, and their team even walked us through CNIL alignments. In a sea of vendors that make you sweat, this was refreshing.

📈 Cleaner, Actionable Insights

The false positive trap? Artikle sidesteps it with what they call their 'contextual relevance layer.' Side-by-side with our old setup, we saw 3x fewer alerts but 5x higher conversion potential. Our sales reps aren't drowning in pings anymore—they're prioritizing real buyer journeys.

🔄 Seamless Workflow Ties

It plugs right into our daily tools: Slack for instant notifications, HubSpot for lead enrichment, and even a custom Zapier flow to our Salesforce instance. We built a simple scoring system that auto-flags high-intent accounts, saving hours weekly.

📉 Real ROI from a Specific Case

Take our recent campaign targeting French manufacturers. Pre-Artikle, we'd chase 50 leads monthly with a 15% qualification rate. Post-switch, intent data helped us focus on 20 high-signal ones, bumping qualification to 45% and closing three deals worth €150K in ARR. That's a 200% ROI on the tool's cost in under 90 days—numbers that match what I've heard from contacts at firms like TechNova Partners and EuroLogix.

And the credibility? It's stacking up: 4.9/5 on G2 from 150+ reviews, top 5 in intent data on Capterra, 95% satisfaction on Trustpilot, and buzzing mentions in LinkedIn polls among EU sales leaders. I've connected with over 50 pros who've adopted it, and the common thread is 'finally, something that just works.' They're agile too—iterating based on user input, with quarterly feature drops keeping things fresh.

Bottom line: If you're navigating B2B in Europe and intent data feels like a headache, give Artikle.io a spin. It's not about fireworks; it's steady, reliable progress.

There’s a country style that’s also close so I started using them, and even though their sandwiches are pricier and the wait times are longer. Like I mean noticeable every time. I still choose to go to them. The quality is so much better, and other than just having to make sure they don’t put too much mayo, it’s always good. At least from what I can remember. I’ve never payed for an item they didn’t have, my sandwiches are always good to perfect, and even their fresh ingredients taste fresh.

1pma33k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kuwait/comments/1pma33k/i_have_a_dream_of_working_as_a_barista/,I have a dream of working as a barista,"Brace yourselves, long post ahead.

As a Kuwaiti, there is a lot of stigma around working j0bs that are seen as menial. That pressure pushed me into corporate work, and over time I grew to hate it. As a kid, I used to romanticize office life. I loved the idea of women’s suits and professional settings. But actually working in an office drained me completely. The bureaucracy, the politics, and the constant pressure made me angry and exhausted in ways I did not expect.

I do not even like coffee, but the idea of being a barista has always stayed with me. I hate people and I hate customer service, but ironically it keeps me sane. There is something about doing a tangible j0b, interacting briefly with people, and then going home without carrying work in my head. I also dream of being a bartender. I imagine owning a small bar somewhere in a tropical Asian country, by the beach, working behind it myself, talking to strangers, and living a life that feels human.

I have two worries, though that make this dream feel impossible and impractical. The pay for baristas in Kuwait is extremely low, and I do not see how I could save enough to eventually build the life I want. I also want to get married someday, but most men I meet here want a career woman. The truth is that I do not want a career. I want a simple and happy life. I do not want deadlines, managers, or the constant anxiety of underperforming. I want to come home to my husband, take care of him, cook, garden, bake, and still have a job that keeps me sane without consuming me.

Considering all of this, it makes it difficult to live a simple life. In a sense that the world I live in doesn’t reward simplicity, but it punishes it. This world rewards ambition, titles, appearances, and suffering that can only be explained on LinkedIn (ugh, don’t even get me started with LinkedIn). This society rewards exhaustion disguised as “drive” and it treats peace as laziness and wanting less is seen as a lack and not a choice.

As a Kuwaiti, the pressure is heavier. Your j0b isn’t just your income because it becomes a statement about your worth, your upbringing, your family, your future marriage prospects. People I meet think I’m wasting potential because I am choosing a barista apron over a blazer. But in my head and heart, I am choosing happiness and simplicity. And that judgment doesn’t just come from society, it bleeds into dating, family conversations, and even your own inner voice on bad days.

So the dream starts to feel impractical and even irresponsible. Low pay, social stigma, the fear of being misunderstood by a future partner. All of it makes a simple life feel strangely inaccessible. As if peace is a luxury only afforded after you’ve suffered “enough” or proved something you never believed in to begin with.

So the question is, is this dream unrealistic? How do I build a life aligned with myself in a system that resists it?",6,1765704558.0,Kuwait,9,0.8,False

I confronted her and she broke down crying, saying she's always been insecure about her looks and wanted to feel confident for once. She said she never met anyone in person and just enjoyed the attention online. She promised to stop.

But then I dug deeper. She's been doing this on Instagram, Bumble, Hinge - there are DOZENS of guys who think they know me. Some have sent personal messages, some are angry I 'ghosted' them. My reputation is being affected by HER behavior.

My parents are begging me not to make a big deal about it because my sister struggles with depression and self-esteem. They say she needs therapy, not punishment.

I'm a 29 year-old guy living and working in Gurgaon, and I'm looking for a woman who shares one of the most important values in my life: being childfree. I’ve known for a long time that parenting isn't part of my path, and I’m hoping to find someone who feels the same—not just someone without kids, but someone who doesn’t want them at all.

I’m into meaningful conversations, mutual growth, and building a partnership based on shared goals, freedom, and curiosity. Whether that means spontaneous road trips, quiet weekends at home, or exploring new hobbies together, I want a relationship that feels like a team—not one that's headed toward the traditional family model.

A few quick things about me:

I love to cook/bake, go for comedy gigs, read crime novels, manga and binge watch sitcoms (anime ,crime, mystery. Also have spent a good chunk of my 20s (about 7 years) in Australia.

Also, recently adopted a kitten so would appreciate any help I could get and find him a mom. 

I'm doing fairly well financially/career vise (debt free and try to invest wisely to the best of my capabilities) and usually don't take life that seriously but happy to put in effort and time to build something together.

I prefer someone who's open minded, ambitious, has their own hobbies and opinions, and would also put in genuine effort & time to build the relationship together.

I'm looking for someone who’s emotionally mature, knows what she wants, and is committed to living a fulfilling life on her own terms. If you're tired of swiping past “maybe someday” profiles and want someone who’s on the same page from the start, I’d love to hear from you.

Let’s skip the small talk and talk about the big stuff—without a baby monitor in the background.

Looking forward to connecting.

Even with all the stitching, the gluing, the God-knows-what chemical cocktail Colby slathered on to make Tommy “whole” again, it wasn’t him. Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

I stumbled back, the cheap plastic curtain Colby had hung from the ceiling wrapping around my ankle like a dead man’s hand. My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just unreachable, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward, trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back, but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

After all, he deserved to get something back too.",1,1765704174.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

As I enjoy an occasional moka / Bialetti with espresso roasts and I live with someone who is into macchiato or capuccino (mostly decaf), however, I was wondering about going more towards espresso. I would perhaps do 1-3 espresso per week (weekends).

I always ruled out getting a portafilter machine and don't want to go down that route. Don't want to do maintenance and space is limited. I was wondering if a Outin Nano or Picopresso would be interesting in this scenario. I don't care about traveling, so perhaps other devices would even make more sense (flair? But it uses more space). Nano or pico come at an interesting price, since I don't want to spend more than €150. I can also get them second hand

I have a Kingrinder K6, scales and an adjustable kettle and would use the K6 for espresso too. So the budget can go fully towards the device plus perhaps a nanofoamer. I don't mind manual work for grinding, pulling and all that. Happy for any suggestions ",1,1765703711.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

This isn't a “let’s see where it goes” kind of post — I’m looking for someone emotionally mature, kind, and genuinely interested in building a life rooted in mutual respect, loyalty, and emotional depth.

I have a stable job in a bank, and I’m educated. I intend to go for further education in the future (eg an additional master or DBA).

I'm someone who values emotional connection, honesty, and clear communication. I'm drawn to people who are warm, generous, and thoughtful — not flashy or impulsive, but steady, sincere, and grounded. You might be someone who's taken your time, grown through your own challenges, and come out the other side with a big heart and an open mind.

I deeply care about mental health, calmness, living a zen life. I know, we all live with chaos, but I’m looking for that energy that can turn around my life in a way that we complement each other and able to face challenges together.

You don't need to be perfect (who is?), but if you're the kind of man who takes responsibility, communicates well, respects both tradition and individuality, and believes in partnership — I’d love to hear from you.

Bonus if you have a sense of humour, emotional intelligence, and know the value of a simple, peaceful life together.

I do have a dark sense of humour. I am also introvert, so it is quite difficult for me to go outside in real life to look for someone. I prefer to be behind my screen. Believe me, I do hate the way this is. But i still believe that I will find the right person one day, no matter how long and how difficult it is.

Other facts: Though I am in the banking sector, I know it is not my true calling. One day I also hope that I will be doing something I am passionate about, like owing a small coffee shop with a bookshop, or a lovely boutique or something that brings peace to my mind.

I love arts, crafts, puzzles, travelling to admire sculpture/ gallery/ beautiful sceneries. I also love cooking and try new cuisine. I like activities such as going to concerts, enjoying orchestras/ theatres, and walking in the nature.

He came down to apologize as I did snap a bit at him and his family. He apologized for not telling me and for trying to push the gift from his parents on me while he knew he should have waited. I went up and apologize to his family and thanked them for the gift.

At 12 pm I messaged him to send them home. 
He agreed. 
1 pm I asked again 
Then I started to spam him begging him to make them leave as I need sleep, I can't sleep when people are over and I have already had 1 anxiety attack because of people showing up un announced. 
He read the messages and ignored them 
I kept messaging him begging, pleading, and then full out flipping ( around 2:30) as I was literally going into another anxiety attack. ( he knows all about them)
His parents finally leave 10 minutes to 3am.
He comes down and sees im crying while rocking my nody to try to calm myself down from a panic attack or anxiety attack, while im texting one of my neat friends. 

He asked why im crying, I can tell he has been drinking, I snap and told him how he broke the boundaries/ house rules. That i begged him to make them leave. 
He argued that they are family, I said we agreed family is in those rules. 
He got upset and told me to ""stop faking panic attacks"" and something else I don't remember.

I let him cool off and went to try to talk to him. He does not see anything wrong. 
When I was in the middle of the panic attack I texted begging him to make them leave over 150 times, and telling him I can't do this anymore and that I want to move out and a few other things. 

He now saying I can get what I want and move out. I have the wifi and electricity under my name. I told him im not moving out and my stuff will be finished moved into the basement tomorrow when my girls show up. ( there is a bathroom in the basement as well) 

He is upset and does not want to talk to me know he says i get what I want. 
I told him what I want is for the boundaries to he upheld by BOTH parties like we agreed upon.
He said no you're just crazy and want control now get out of my face. 
He is now laying upstairs on my couch, while he watches TV drunk.

I told him his parents are no longer welcomed here 
There will be no Christmas gathering 
And that my friends will be here tomorrow.

He thinks I fake my anxiety, depression and panic attacks.
He wants me to respect his boundaries but won't respect mine.

I’m a 5'2"" female, 75.8 kg, 21 years old, and I’ve finally decided to lose weight. I feel like I’m in the right mindset now. I’ve truly understood that consistency matters far more than motivation. My mind isn’t going to magically make me work out, I just have to tune out the lazy and quitting thoughts and keep going.

I’ve also finally gained control over my binge-eating habits, which is a big win for me.

I started this journey mainly because I want to ace an exam in 2027, and I know that to perform well mentally, my body needs to be healthy and active. I’ve noticed that I study much better when I’m moving and taking care of my health.
Evidence: Over the past week, I’ve been walking around 10k steps (~7 km) daily, doing 20 minutes of mat Pilates (my form isn’t great yet since I’ve just started), and eating two meals a day.

Right now, my goals are:

1. Losing fat
2. Building stamina
3. Moving more
4. Most importantly, learning to enjoy exercise(I've been using pushing myself to do an excessive, like even if i'm doing it slow, or the form is not too good, I will still do it. I never did that before)
5. Letting go of binge-eating habits for good


For this month, my focus is on:

1.Gradually increasing my steps to 13–14k per day
2.Being able to do 30–40 minutes of Pilates
3.Improving flexibility, especially since my hips are very tight

I’ve intentionally set small, achievable goals.

I don’t want to make drastic food changes right now. My only rules are:

1. No ordering food
2. No junk food
3. Only home-cooked meals(nothing fried)
4. No sugar, except ½ teaspoon in my black coffee

I’m not focusing on protein or macros at the moment. I have limited knowledge, and more importantly, I want to take things slow. I’ve finally realized that health is a lifelong goal, not a 3-month crash diet followed by old habits. I have my entire life ahead of me, and I want this to be sustainable.

Next month: Increase cardio—maybe try Zumba videos, walk more, and add incline walking if I feel ready. I’ll still stick to simple meals.

February: I’ll reassess based on the results and how I feel.

Final Thoughts
Do you think this approach sounds okay?

P.S. I understand the importance of protein, but I want to focus on that after losing around 7–8 kg. Right now, my priority is fat loss. Building muscle is secondary, and I’ll be sticking to bodyweight exercises only until January.",1,1765702426.0,PetiteFitness,2,1.0,False

Well, it is nothing new and been done countless of times here: basically, make hot coffee to taste and pour it over gelatin, stir until gelatin dissolves and let it set.

Here is breakdown of specific thing pictured:



Jelly (37 kcal total):

1. \~500ml of freshly boiled hot water

2. 11g pure gelatin powder, unsweetened

3. 10g instant coffee (perhaps was a bit too much to my taste)

4. 5 tablets of sweetener



You can use any type of 0 kcal sweetener and any coffee, including actually good coffee.



""Crema"" (113 kcal):

1. 120g Greek Yogurt (I had 2.5% fat)

2. 10g chocolate protein powder

3. \~2-3g instant coffee



I whisked this with stick blender until it was somewhat between 1.5x-2x the original volume. Pour over jelly, sprinkle with some cinnamon or cocoa just for looks.

Just some slice of life cuteness.... I'm imagining that you left your hometown to go to college and never really looked back. However. The chubby guy you'd been dating was left alone, heartbroken and in his rut. That's me!

Anyway, ten years later, you're back for Christmas. It's the first time since forever. Literally the first person you see is that guy in a coffee shop. But 30..…and well, 20kg heavier, with muscles on his muscles. Think Terry from Brooklyn 99 muscles. And I'm not working in the Starbucks, I own the business opposite. 

As well as the successful business, the incredible body, fluent in four languages, I'm newly single. 

You barely recognise me when I sends over a coffee. for you. The chat is respectful and fluent. Like you've never left. And you need to see me again. 

Thanksgiving is terrible. Your sister in law is horrible and they have announced their second pregnancy. For the twentieth time she asked when you'll settle down. Then one of the close family members announced that she's got a medical problem. It's all too much. Your phone buzzes.

'So....how's your Christmas? I have to say I'm thankful for having just got these people out of my house. I'm just cleaning up. Do you want to pop round? We never properly caught up. And you looked amazing.'

An hour later, we were in my huge, warm house, laughing about nothing in particular. 

Two hours later, holding hands, discussing our lives to date.

The morning after, intertwined and amending your flight back home so we can spend more time together 

Exactly a year later, it's Christmas again. I smile and look other to my wife and place my hands on your growing tummy. 'Alexis. It's been quite a year....Shall we reminisce?'

So just a bit of context without digging to deep.

So recently I have worked way more than normal, usual family goal reasons and hard times like we all go through.

Im aware im burning the candle at both ends and now im burnt. ( I get a kick out of being a hard worker or going above expectations )

Mentally and physically broken. And I accept that i deserve me time and a break, maybe a day off or an evening off. ( i work days off unless kids have a event or classes )

Recently windows of opportunity have presented themselves, example...partner getting hair done but family friend whos children are friends with mine also there so she takes the girls and my son is out with his mates.

IM FREE !!!! 

Instead of kicking my shoes off and playing some videos games or watching TV maybe go get a coffee. ( examples ) which my partner fully encourages.. 

I start cleaning, re organise the shed, start fixing little things, clean the car, organising emails, do the washing, cook tea, wash up. ( like im seeing attention or praise )

Anything except the things I really want to do. And I feel like im doing it to spite myself or maybe I feel like don't deserve it. Or cant enjoy things anymore.

Im angrier, short to temper, less loving, even sometimes I feel empty, ambitions are shot, fitness has nose dived, diet out of control.

*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

**Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves**  
The New Jersey Devils (-155) are favored to beat the Vancouver Canucks (+130) on December 14, 2025, but let’s not get too excited. The Devils’ 60.6% implied probability (based on their moneyline odds) feels less like a sure thing and more like a bet on your uncle to not spill his coffee—optimism, but not confidence. Meanwhile, the Canucks’ 55.6% implied probability as underdogs? That’s the statistical equivalent of a “Free Coffee” coupon from a defunct café.

The over/under is 5.5 goals, and both teams have the offensive firepower (and defensive incompetence) to blow that out. The Devils allow 3.2 goals per game (22nd in the league), and the Canucks surrender 3.6 (dead last). Combined, they average 5.6 goals per game—just 0.1 above the total. If you’ve ever tried to juggle flaming torches while riding a unicycle, you know that 0.1 difference is the difference between a standing ovation and a trip to the burn unit.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Acquisitions, and the NHL’s Version of Whac-A-Mole**  
The Devils are missing Jack Hughes (finger injury), a player so good at playmaking he could probably score with his *elbow*. Without him, New Jersey relies on Jesper Bratt and Nico Hischier to carry the offensive load—like asking two penguins to haul a sleigh through a blizzard. Not impossible, but not exactly efficient.

The Canucks? They’re in a post-trade dumpster fire. Elias Pettersson (their star center) is day-to-day with an “upper body” injury, which in NHL speak means he’ll miss this game and maybe the next

Starting the gym soon. (Probably tm, or next Monday). 

I started to do home workout a few months ago and managed to get my weight from 57.5 to 62.5, which I believe  is quite remarkable, it was totally natural and just by pull ups and squats. Though the eating part was truly a struggle.  

However, since last few weeks its becoming harder to stick to my diet and get my any higher. I am still underweight for my height. I should be at least 65 for my height and I am aiming for 70kgs by the mid of 2026.  I have tried gym before also but I always struggle to see genuine results. It requires a lot of discipline in getting food down my throat. I live a very active lifestyle where I have to leave at 8 am for my work and I reach home by 9 pm. I know its not healthy or sustainable but for now this is the reality of my life. My question is what should I do? Should I start gym? If so any important tips I should be aware of?

This is my current Ideal diet,

1. First meal: 2 eggs, one glass of banana lassi and some fruits

2. Second meal: Coffee and a handful of nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews and raisins)

3. Third meal: 3 roti, one katori rice and sabji

4. Fourth meal: Two eggs, bread butter

5. Fifth meal: three roti, one katori rice, daal and sabji andone glass of banana lassi.

  
a. What else I can change or add in my diet to increase calorie intake? This much food is already hard for me to eat.

b. What are some caveats I should be aware of before joining gym? If I don't see results it takes away my motivation very fast :( and I am scared I lose my motivation again. I really wanna get my weight higher, I dn't wanna feel so skinny and this is high time I should start taking it even more seriously.

1pm96hj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pm96hj,"Militado ML-20 my review, and opinions from REAL WOMEN also.small comparison between the phorcydes PH-2","
I bought this watch with my own money as a birthday present to myself. I promised myself I would buy another watch only after saving enough to buy an apartment, so wish me luck. I am not affiliated with any brand, store, reviewer, or individual. I have no association with absolutely anyone. ( except, my friends, family and gf; none of them are willing to give me any money)

Here is the review. Read carefully, I put some effort into it.

So, the Militado ML-20 arrived at my place yesterday. I usually wear watches with a more vintage look, so I wanted something more modern this time. Something not shiny and not black. I chose a sand blasted  watch because I don’t sell my watches, and I expect this kind of finish to age and patina in an interesting way over time

My main options were Engelmann, Steelflier, and Militado.

The Engelmann looks like the premium option, but it’s not in stock and hasn’t been released yet. The Steelflier was too big for me, and the bracelet didn’t really match the watch. It also lacks solid end links. The movement was another important factor. I wanted something different from the NH35. My understanding is that Engelmann plans to use a Miyota 9-series movement, so I’m fairly sure I’ll buy one in the future, hopefully not a Sinn U50 homage, but something more original when they release a model that actually interests me.

The Militado ML-20 uses the controversial PT5000 movement. Controversial because some people claim it can be damaged by hand-winding, and there are reports of units arriving dead on arrival.

My watch arrived in perfect working order, and I simply won’t hand-wind it. If the movement gives me problems in the future, I’ll update this post. ( I tested the watch on a timegrapher and it is tuning at +8 seconds a day, it is not COSC but it also does not cost 10k)

The watch looks very good overall, but it’s not perfect. I have two main complaints. First, the bezel is slightly misaligned. Not terribly, but noticeable if you’re a perfectionist. If you care a lot about alignment, this is something to consider. Second, the outer bezel construction is made of two pieces. The original Sinn U50 uses a single-piece bezel, and both Steelflier and Engelmann kept that design choice. Militado uses an insert instead. Also, the red markers on the bezel don’t exactly match the red on the hands. The shade is different. Not a big deal, but it’s there.

That said, the bezel action itself is very good and produces a very satisfying sound.

The bracelet doesn’t have on-the-fly micro-adjustment, which is disappointing. Phorcydes offers a watch at a similar price with that feature, so this feels like a missed opportunity.

That said, the bracelet was easy to size, and the five micro-adjustment holes in the clasp helped me get a good, though not perfect, fit.

The brasalet links are solid and perfectly match the case.

The lume is good and well matched. It won’t bother you. There is a very slight difference between the lume color on the hands and the markers, but it’s minimal and basically irrelevant. This is normal for watches under the four-figure range. The dial is clean. I checked it with a jeweler’s loupe and found no debris.

The lume is very bright and long-lasting. 

The date window isn’t matte, and the font is different from the rest of the dial. I thought this would bother me before buying the watch, but in reality, I kind of like it.

The watch has an interesting anti-fingerprint coating that keeps it looking clean most of the time. The crystal is sapphire, very clear, and appears to have a strong anti-reflective coating.

The screw-down crown action is good when setting the date and time, but the angle of the crown makes it genuinely hard to screw back in. When I say hard, I mean it. I adjusted the watch at a coffee shop and definitely looked ridiculous trying to get the crown seated properly.

As a final, completely unscientific note, my girlfriend preferred the Phorcydes PH-2, while my sister liked the Militado better. My girlfriend is a designer and a self-described hippie, my sister is an architect and a snob. My mother said that watches are a waste of money; she is a teacher, so she doesn’t know anything about watches or money.",6,1765700909.0,Militado,0,0.81,False

It’s a weird situation because i don’t want to declare and pay extra taxes, but i also want to keep my Global Entry status.

I am a 31 year old man, originally from Southern Kerala. I work in tech as a Devops engineer in Bangalore. I'm looking for someone based in Bangalore or planning to. be, with whom I can be friends as well as turn it to a life-long relationship. I want to be child free because I think the world as it is now is going to be difficult for a new life to grow and survive, which is already overpopulated, and don’t want to devote the rest of my life’s time and energy in that, which is a big task indeed. I would rather love to live life freely with someone and travel around the world.

A little about me:

I'm 176 cm, 75kg, active with workouts for the past 1.5 years, continuing dedicatedly on the transformation i wanted to make and progressing well. I play badminton. I love football, traveling and also trying my hand with cooking and started reading books recently. I'm a non-vegetarian and atheist. I love pets, and have 2 dogs in my hometown and love cats too.

What am I looking for:

My type of woman is someone who wants to be childfree, is emotionally intelligent, honest, understanding, empathetic and can communicate well. Someone who is okay with silences in conversations at times and not in a rush to be in a relationship . We don’t need to be in a pressure cooker situation to prove ourselves to be someone we are not. Let’s embrace our natural and real selves.

Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :)

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences.

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me.

If this interests you, then feel free to reach out over DM with a little introduction about yourself.",2,1765700813.0,ChildfreeIndia,1,0.75,False

1pm93dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1pm93dz/that_one_morning_my_aeropress_was_ruining_my/,That one morning my AeroPress was ruining my coffee,"I was obsessed with making the “perfect” AeroPress cup trying every technique and grind size I could find online. But every batch still came out weak or bitter. I tried pressing harder, squeezing harder, even freezing the water first and nothing worked.

Then one night I brewed side by side with a friend who knows AeroPress inside out. He asked what water temp I was using.
I hadn’t checked so it was boiling straight from the kettle every time.

Once I dialed in temp and let the grounds bloom a bit before pressing, the difference was insane sweetness came out, acidity balanced itself, and the coffee finally tasted like AeroPress should.

Funny how one little setting can change everything.

Has anyone else discovered hidden AeroPress mistakes that just weren’t in guides?

I'm 17F from Vietnam (you can just call me Sylvia) and am looking for some online friends to talk to, mainly to get to know other people and learn about your cultures if you have anything you want to share or are proud of! I'm into reading (specifically fiction; I've never really read any non-fiction books), talking, writing poetry, gaming (used to play genshin but stopped after a while; now I play games like Wuthering Waves, Good pizza great pizza, and Good coffee great coffee), anime, and listening to music (mostly indie pop, but I'm open to recommendations if you have any!). A few other video games I really like are Mouthwashing and any game by Chilla's Art. I'm also a big fan of learning new things (literally anything at all, regardless of subject/topic) so it would be really cool if anyone could yap about things they're interested in, or just talk about things we might have in common. I'm quite the introvert and may be awkward at first, but I also think I open up quickly and can keep the conversation going (maybe :3! I can't be sure). I'm looking for someone/people who want to be genuine friends, preferably female (trans fem is also ok!) so DM me if anyone's interested! Time zones will be an issue, but I promise not to ghost anyone and will respond to texts when I'm awake and have the time.

We can plan something public and comfortable for both.

Tall tanned and been told handsome (humbly), love me my morning Italian coffee! I’ll take a Starbucks on the way ay to the office if I have to! Haha. 

Love me a good read/book, HBO shows and some on Netflix as well. 

Catch me on the beach any day of the year! In fact. We can totally Rendezvous there, and take a long walk… if you are not like a 1000 mile away! Haha. I do like hiking but won’t make a commitment unless it’s an area with Waterfalls! Haha. 

Oh! Almost forgot… call me old school but I love spending time in Book stores! The feeling of being surrounded by books is overwhelmingly awesome haha. 

I love all and anything delicious, food that is and fine dining esp when I travel to new places!
