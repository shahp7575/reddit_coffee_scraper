I'd love your thoughts on something I am considering building for improving company culture / morale

A product to assist with team building as a slack app.

Leaders can set preferences for company team building goals, then platform will send periodic invites to employees once a week/month/quarter to an optional local activity onsite or offsite for the companies employees in the area.

It could be an onsite, like an in the office coffee tasting or yoga session for example in the morning or a during work/ lunch activity like catered lunch or poker game (no real gambling). I'm thinking this might help with return to office. Or it could be an offsite to go gokarting, pottery, escape room, golfing etc. it would not be team specific or mandatory, just any employee interested in going. Think of it as micro hangouts sponsored by the company.

Set it up as a slack app so leaders can install once for everyone and then they can get invites (which they can turn off). If not enough people are interested it cancels and there's no event for that time so enough are it automatically books it. It can learn overtime based on responses and interest.

I wanted to come to you guys as the ideal target audience and see if this is something you would get use out of?",1,1737230896.0,managers,1,1.0,False

Hey fellow wanderers of r/TravelTrotters! After journeying through 50 awe-inspiring countries, I’m thrilled to share some hidden gems from my recent European road trip escapades. Imagine driving through breathtaking landscapes, past ancient castles, and into towns that echo with stories of the past. If this sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee, we don’t judge here!), join me as we traverse the continent along some of Europe’s most historic routes.

**1. The Romantic Road, Germany 🏰**

This 400km route is every fairytale lover’s dream. Winding from Würzburg to Füssen, you’ll be treated to charming medieval towns, picturesque vineyards, and the iconic Neuschwanstein Castle. A must-visit is Rothenburg ob der Tauber—a town frozen in time with its perfectly preserved fortifications. 

*Tip*: Visit during September for the wine festivals and experience the vibrant local culture. And don't forget to try a schneeball, a delicious pastry local to the region!

**2. The Amalfi Coast, Italy 🌊**

Ah, the allure of Italy never fades! The Amalfi Coast’s 37-mile stretch from Sorrento to Salerno is a visual feast. With dramatic cliffs and azure waters, every turn of the road is Instagram-worthy. Stop by Positano to soak in its vibrant architecture and indulge in some fresh seafood.

*Tip*: To avoid peak tourist seasons, plan your trip for late spring or early autumn. Driving can be a bit daunting, so consider exploring a portion by scooter for a more exhilarating experience.

**3. Route 66, France 🇫🇷**

Not to be confused with the American counterpart, the French Route 66, known as the Route des Grandes Alpes, offers a stunning trek through the French Alps. Starting from Lake Geneva and culminating at the azure waters of the Mediterranean, be prepared for majestic vistas and charming alpine villages.

*Personal Anecdote*: I stumbled upon a delightful family-run chalet in Chamonix with the most heartwarming fondue. It was the perfect spot to rest and enjoy the warm hospitality of the French Alps.

**4. The Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland 🍀**

Last but certainly not least, Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way is a rugged 2,500km journey of unspoiled coastlines and dramatic seascapes. Don’t miss the Cliffs of Moher, where the landscape will leave you utterly mesmerized. Each village along the route has its own charm and story, with traditional Irish music filling the air.

*Tip*: Pack a raincoat! The weather can be unpredictable, but it adds to the adventure. Stop at Dingle for some incredible local artisan shops and possibly spot a dolphin or two!

These routes promise not just breathtaking views but a deeper connection to the history and culture that fashioned these lands. So, pack your bags, hit the road, and let the winds of Europe whisper its ancient tales. 🌍✨

I have a condo about 10 min off the strip. The area isn't great but decent. 2bd 2bath but the bathrooms are dated and I've been quoted 20k min. to renovate both. 1,072sqft  , wth washer and drier. On the bottom floor. Has covered parking. Just put brand new appliances in the kitchen. Has Built in entertainment center and coffee bar area. Three balconies. I bought it for 150k some years ago but the HOA fees are becoming ridiculous. They have upped the price again this year to just over $300 a month. IMO it isn't worth it anymore, there haven't been any improvements to the complex in years, the pool and spa are always under maintenance but yet never fixed.  I've been thinking about selling for the last two years but some are saying to hold on to it or rent it out. Average condo is selling for upper 200s in this complex.

I recently brought home an ESA to my dog friendly apartment. I live in an apartment complex with thick, concrete walls. My ESA is having separation anxiety because she was living in another state with another puppy and now she's alone with me. She's been here for a week and it's getting better. 

She only barks when she can't see me in certain rooms. I'm training her (along with professional training) for this but this causes her to bark, she's a rottie so it's loud. I try to train her during the daytime and before sleeping so 3x around 10am to 3pm then around 11pm. She only barks for around a minute to 5 minutes (not continuously). 

I'n very nervous that my neighbors might complain. For my 2 years here we never really see and hear each other.

She has also brought some CPC aides with her to take notes.*

*Every few blocks, the roads get very bumpy and filled with potholes.*

Polka: Well, there’s another pothole. That makes what? The third one in the last like five kilometers?

CPC Aide: Yep, and that one made me spill my Tim Hortons coffee all over my lap!

Polka: Sorry about that. I’ll stop at the next rest stop so you can get cleared up. This is exactly why I wanted to do this drive. It’s one thing to give speeches about infrastructure challenges, like the Liberals like to do, but it’s another thing to deal with them firsthand. Our roads and transportation system need action urgently. 

*The vehicle shakes as they go over a road that has not been paved in years.*

Polka: This honestly isn’t even just like an inconvenience anymore, it’s a safety issue too. Imagine the parents having to drive their kids to school on roads like this. Or truck drivers trying to transport goods across the country and dealing with this. This is definitely delaying transportation and threatening Canadian safety on the roads. This is unacceptable. We need to establish reliable roads and transportation systems. Not just think making everything electric is going to magically solve every problem like the Liberals basically said in that terrible Throne Speech.

*Polka slows down as they approach a construction zone. She sees some workers repairing part of the road.*

Polka: Do you guys see that? These Canadians are working hard to patch up potholes and improve our roads. But relying on regular hard-working citizens to do our job for us isn’t a long-term solution. We need to invest in infrastructure. We need to work with provinces, municipalities, and Indigenous communities to ensure everyone has access to safe, modern, and efficient transportation.

*The aides nod and write notes.*

Leader of the Opposition: Canadian public transportation systems need help too. I’ve heard from so many Canadians who are tired of delayed buses, overcrowded trains, and the unreliable schedules. It makes them late to work and school and it is unacceptable. If we want to fight climate change by encouraging less cars on the roads, the public transportation system must be updated. This drive has been enlightening. We have lots of work to do. And as the Leader of the Opposition, I’ll be encouraging the government to prioritize infrastructure. Canadians deserve better than this!

*Once arriving in Ontario, LOTO Polka posted on all of her social media accounts about the need for Canadian government to improve infrastructure and transportation after what she witnessed on the roads.*",1,1737230716.0,cmhocpress,0,1.0,False

 hal already plans to use the laundering money to lure the client kidou in his future plans to stop the weapon smuggling, hal finds out that, kidou is in a restaurant, he goes inside to get information from kidou, and he already formulates the plan, he figures out that the client is a gambler, so hal acts as a debt collector from a casino, hal keeps the baggage on the counter for his plans, then he pursues kidou (the client) cold reads him acting as a bill collector, kidou falls for it and then arranges a gamble (as predicted by hal that kidou will arrange a gamble, so hal kept the baggage at the counter so that the waitress would ask him to get the baggage, with which hal can act like he's getting that baggage while he's going to prepare for his plans) now kidou explains him the basic rules of the coin pushing game, kidou just wanted to get rid of hal (debt collector persona) kidou arranged this game coz he's good at it so he guarantees his win, then right after kidou explains these game rules, Hal predicts everything that is going to happen from now on, the waitress immediately comes to hal as hal predicted, and asks him to take the baggage, and as hal predicted, he gets up to take the baggage, while taking 18 creamers also hal secretly takes a number 6 creamer for his strategy, note that those 18 creamers are advantageous for kidou (it would look like that) while hal is the one who takes the advantage.

now hal has seen a much better way to play this coin pushing game, basically by using the coffee creamers as dice, so hal has to manipulate kidou to bring the coffee creamer rule, and then hal can proceed his plan, so basically hal predicted everything because the coffee creamer has a strategy, that is hal can join two coffee creamers beforehand without kidou even realising, and it would look like its one coffee creamer, so hal has to bait kidou into taking this 2 in one creamer but he has to control the entire game progress, because those 2 creamers need to align with the victory of hal, one creamer that kidou is going to choose has to align with kidou's victory, meanwhile the creamer that is secretly joined by hal is going to make hal win, so hal takes 18 creamers precisely that kidou is going to use for his advantage, and note that every single one of those 18 creamer is special, and hal has already predicted how exactly kidou would distribute those creamers, hal has already predicted what 9 creamers he would receive from kidou, and he had even memorized all 18 creamers in a single glance, so by asking the waitress to bring those 18 creamers near hal and kidou's table, so that kidou gets tempted by those 18 creamers and use them as dice in the game without even realising he's getting manipulated by hal, then hal intentionally lose the game, obviously to manipulate kidou to arrange a new fair game, hal also acts dumb intentionally, then kidou arranges a new set of rules for the game with coffee creamer, which hal had already anticipated, and hal knows exactly how kidou will distribute those 18 creamers, kidou basically used creamers coz of the certain win strategy, which hal obviously noticed it, hal chooses to defeat kidou in this way so that now kidou even asks for betting money, because hal wanted to tempt kidou for his future plans in battleship arc, now after explaining the modified rules, kidou asks to choose 1 creamer from each side to decide who goes first, the bigger one would go first, hal chooses 66 and kidou who knows hal's creamers and the locations of those creamers knows that hal has chosen 66 number creamer, so kidou chooses 72 number creamer and goes first (going first is also a strategy to win), now hal picks up both of those creamers and acts like dropping them and hence joining the number 6 creamer he had with him with the number 72 creamer, and then he keeps the 66 and 72 creamer in a glass, kidou doesnt notice that he joined 6 and 72 creamer, and now hal has to bait kidou to choose this 72 creamer that was already used for choosing who goes first, to win the game with that 72 creamer, but since 6 is joint with that, kidou would have to choose the number 6 creamer forcefully, and this creamer would turn the tables making hal win, so in order to even make this strategy possible, hal has to make 72 and 6 creamer align with each other in such a way that 72 would decide kidou's victory, while 6 will decide hal's victory, hal has to control the entire progress of the game, getting himself in a losing situation, where kidou can win with a number 2 creamer, and that number 2 creamer is number 72 creamer because of the 2, while in order for hal to win, if kidou gets a number 6 creamer, kidou will completely lose, so hal had to manipulate every turn of the game, every choice of coffee creamer, and hal Manipulated kidou to even bring money in this game, even the wager was decided by creamers, so hal predicted even this, and finds a way to bait kidou, remember the baggage? It has 100 million money, hal exposes that money to kidou suddenly out of nowhere, he completely exposes that he has the money kidou requested for, which shocks kidou, this money is very important for kidou like his life is on the line, hal made this move to manipulate kidou in many different ways, like increasing wager in a unique way, hal wastes half of those 100 million in front of kidou on coffee creamers, acting as he's aligning them while he's baiting kidou to get that money at all cost, and that would make kidou choose the 72 creamer that was already used and joined by hal, hal has about 50 million yen now, hal even wasted this money so that kidou tells him the name of the ship and the location, and kidou does exactly that, hal wanted to bait kidou to take the money and flee, so progressing the game, hal makes the game situatuon in such a way that, now kidou has only one move to win, if kidou chooses a number 2 creamer he will win the game, however kidou already has 21 number creamer on him, but kidou doesnt choose that creamer even tho he can win it, because 21 would not equal the wager to 50 million yen, kidou wants to take all of the remaining money which is 50 million and the 21 creamer would only make the wager to be 16 million, so kidou sees the 72 number creamer that was already used, and decides to steal that creamer, because 72 creamer would not only make kidou win with the number 2 dice, but also make the wager relative to 50 million, more than the amount of money hal had left, and hal was the one who created this entire situation, so kidou does exactly as hal wanted, he takes the 72 creamer, but as hal had joint 6 with it, kidou had to take the 6 number creamer forcefully, and then kidou is cornered, now the rest of the creamers kidou and hal had were also predicted by hal, with the rest of the remaining creamers,kidou will lose while hal will win so that's what he did with the creamers.

Let's Get Comfy and Crunch Some Numbers,"## Investing in Your Spine: A Personal Journey into the World of Ergonomic Chairs

Ever found yourself daydreaming about a chair that's as comfy as your favorite couch, yet won't break the bank? I've been there, friends. But when I stumbled upon a $400 ergonomic chair, I couldn't help but wonder, 'Is it worth it to buy a $400 ergonomic chair for one year?' Let's dive in and find out together. Spoiler alert: it's not just about the money - it's about your back, your wallet, and your sanity. So, grab a coffee (or tea, no judgment here), and let's get cozy with some numbers and personal stories. Who knows, you might just find your perfect seat.
  
  
## The Ergonomic Enigma

Let’s talk about ergonomic chairs. **They've always felt like the secretive cousin at the family reunion**, right? I mean, who knew a chair could cost as much as a small car? When I first stumbled into the world of ergonomic seating, I thought, ""Is this a trick? Is a comfy seat really worth $400?""

I remember reading an article that showcased this $400 beauty. It had features that sounded like they were straight out of a sci-fi movie! Adjustable lumbar support, integrated heating—like, **am I sitting or in a cozy spa?** My curiosity was piqued. I began to wonder if my old, creaky chair was really doing me more harm than good.

So, here’s where it gets a bit funny. Picture this: I decided to test the limits of my existing chair one afternoon. I leaned back, and—BOOM!—it collapsed beneath me like a cheap deck chair at a beach picnic. I ended up flat on the floor, staring at the ceiling, wondering if I had just met my tragic end mid-Netflix binge. _Note to self: check chair’s weight limit next time._

That disaster made me think twice about all that ergonomic hype. _Did I really want to risk another chair catastrophe?_ So, I started chatting with friends. Turns out, many had varying experiences—some swore by their pricey chairs, while others, well, still looked like pretzels when they sat down.

What about you? Have you ever had a chair disaster or an ergonomic epiphany? Let’s hear those stories! 

## The Price is Right? Or is it Wrong?\](title: The Price Is Right? Or Is It Wrong?)

Okay, let’s talk turkey – or rather, that $400 price tag. Is it a steal, or are we being taken for a ride? The first time I caught sight of that price, my wallet almost fainted. I mean, seriously, $400 for a chair? I could buy a wardrobe full of comfy pajamas for that kind of cash! But then I thought, “If I’m going to be spending hours glued to this chair, maybe my spine deserves better.” 

So here’s the math that helped me overcome the initial shock. If I use this chair for about 8 hours a day, that’s roughly 240 hours a month. Multiply that by 12 months, and we’re talking about 2,880 hours in a year. Now, if we divide that $400 price tag by 2,880 hours, it breaks down to about $0.14 per hour. That’s less than my morning coffee from that fancy café! Suddenly, it doesn’t seem so bad. 

Let’s compare this chair to some alternatives. A budget chair might run about $100, but if I need to replace it every year due to bad back pain, that’s a total of $200 over two years. On the flip side, some ultra-high-end chairs can set you back $1,200, which is a punch in the gut! Warranties? Always check those! Some chairs offer up to 10 years of protection, giving you a nice safety net.

So, what do you think? Have you crunched the numbers on your own chair purchases? Share your thoughts in the comments!

## The Ergonomic Dream Team

""Did you know that a good ergonomic chair can actually help you feel like a superhero while you're working? Seriously! I didn't believe it until I finally let my spine experience it firsthand. Picture this: slumped over like a noodle versus sitting like a proud peacock. Big difference!

So, I decided to chat with my friend—let’s call them, ‘Ergo Expert’—to break down what truly makes an ergonomic chair worth the hype. I asked, ‘What features should I really prioritize?’ They replied, ‘Ah, my curious friend, here’s the lowdown!’

* **Adjustable Armrests**: These aren't just fancy add-ons. If they’re not adjustable, your arms might end up feeling like spaghetti after a long day. You want them resting comfortably, not dangling like a piñata.
* **Proper Lumbar Support**: This is like the superhero cape for your back. Good lumbar support hugs the small of your back, keeping you aligned and preventing that pesky back pain from crashing the party.
* **Tilt Mechanism**: Think of this as the tilt-a-whirl at an amusement park. A chair that tilts lets you lean back and relax without feeling like you’re about to slide off a cliff.

‘Anything else?’ I probed. ‘Absolutely! Look for material that's breathable. You don’t want to feel like you’re sitting on a hot stove,’ Ergo Expert chuckled. 

I also found out that a few brands do stand out, but let’s keep this unbiased and focus on the features instead. It’s all about how these elements can help you feel great while tackling emails or zoom calls. You wouldn’t want to be that person who needs a crane just to get out of their chair, right?""

## The Year-Long Challenge

When you think about spending $400 on an ergonomic chair for a year, it might feel like you're about to buy a ticket to a concert but you’re only going to listen to one song. I mean, who wouldn’t want the luxury of that heavenly seat-goodness? But also, is one year enough time to really judge if this hefty pile of cash was a wise decision? After living with my own ergonomic companion for a whole year, I can tell you—it's kind of like munching on a really good slice of cake. Yeah, it tastes awesome in the moment, but there's a whole lot more benefits hidden under the icing!

Now, let's chat about that long-term magic of investing in ergonomic furniture. Imagine your back feeling all cozy and supported, like it’s lounging on a cloud, rather than feeling like it's been run over by a runaway bus. The gain from an ergonomic chair is like planting a tree. In the beginning, it’s just a little sapling, not doing much more than soaking up the sun. But over time, that tree grows big and strong, giving you shade and a place to chill. Better posture and less back pain? Those are the fruits of your labor!

Now, picture this: every time you plop down on a cheap, rickety chair, it groans as if it’s about to give up the ghost. The years roll by, and your back is like an old, worn-out map—twisted and crinkly. Or, on the flip side, you stick with your $400 wonder – the chair that hugs you like a loyal friend. What’s your back going to feel like after a year? Load up those thoughts; it’s a fascinating ride!

## The Review Show: Real-Life Experiences

When it comes to ergonomic chairs, the stories folks share often sound like epic tales of summer camp adventures – some have thrilling highs, while others hit unexpected lows. I’ve gathered up a few real-life experiences from friends and online reviews that show just how these pricey chairs can change (or fail to change) a person’s backstory.

My buddy Tom, who works from home, took the plunge and splurged on a high-end ergonomic chair. He swears by it now. “It’s like sitting on a cloud,” he told me, wide-eyed like he just unlocked the secret to the universe. “My back used to feel like it was auditioning for a role in a horror movie, but now it’s a walk in the park.” Now that he’s sitting pretty without the aches, he’s convinced that the $400 was worth every penny.

Then there's Lisa, who’s a bit of a skeptic. She tried out her coworker's chair once and said, “I didn’t feel a difference. In fact, it made me feel like the chair was plotting against me."" Funny, right? But it goes to show how personal comfort can be. There's no one-size-fits-all solution here. Some people rave about the spikes of support these chairs offer, while others just want their old buddy, the kitchen chair, back.

Online reviews reveal similar sentiments. Many users feel a dramatic difference, yet a significant number find the hype hard to justify. “I still find myself slouching while binging my favorite show,” one reviewer lamented. Talk about a letdown! 

In short, while my friends' experiences vary quite a bit, it’s clear that whether you’re lounging like a king or feeling betrayed by a chair, there’s no doubt that comfort (and a well-supported spine) is worth pondering. So, is a comfy chair for $400 worthwhile? It seems like the answer depends more on the person than the price tag.

## The Verdict: Is It Worth It?\](title: The Verdict: Is It Worth It?)

After months of sitting in what I can only describe as a medieval torture device masquerading as a chair, I finally bit the bullet and invested in a $400 ergonomic chair. The question that hangs in the air, like a cloud of broken dreams and stiff backs, is: was it worth it? 

To put it bluntly, my rear end has never been happier. The moment I sank into that chair, it was as if my spine let out a great sigh of relief, just like I do after a long week. It’s incredible how something so simple can change the entire workspace vibe. I found myself leaning back in my chair to think, rather than leaning forward to brace myself against the pain gnawing at my back. 

But let’s not just stop there. I also took the time to look up studies — yes, I really did! A report from the American Chiropractic Association revealed that an ergonomic chair can reduce back pain by up to 50%. That’s way better than the 0% I was getting from my old chair! 

Now, I get it; $400 feels like a lot for a chair, especially if you're on a tight budget. But think about it this way: is a year of comfort and the chance to work without constant pain worth the investment? At least for me, the answer is a resounding yes! 

So here’s a question for you: what are your thoughts? Do you think comfort is worth the cost? Drop your verdict in the comments!

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks - the million-dollar question answered, or at least explored in depth. Whether you're ready to invest in an ergonomic chair or not, I hope this journey has given you some food for thought. Remember, it's not just about the money; it's about what's best for your back, your wallet, and your sanity. Thanks for joining me on this comfy adventure. Now, it's your turn to share - what's your verdict? Is it worth it to buy a $400 ergonomic chair for one year? \*\*Word count:\*\* 120 words",1,1737230552.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

I’ve fallen big time for my best friend and I don’t know what to do. 
We dated for about 5 months from 2019 until the pandemic hit. We sort of drifted when we couldn’t see each other, but then found each other again at the end of 2020. Just as friends.
Since then we regularly meet up for lunch. Go to gigs and festivals together. Spend a lot of our spare time together and often talk about the future and ‘our dream house’, holidays, being old and what we’ll be like when we age, he often stays round (though nothing really happens except a few drunk kisses every now and then). He truly is my best friend. 
Trouble is I’ve fallen for him big time after the realisation hit me that I wouldn’t want anyone one on either side to come between us. He’s the only one I want around, I love being with him and feel almost giddy when I know he’s going to be coming round for a coffee.
I really don’t want to damage our friendship because he means the absolute world to me but I also don’t know how he would feel if I told him how deep my feelings run.
We’ve been friends for so long I would hate to ruin what we do have.

As part of a bigger RTW project we did the arguably most difficult west coast section from Ghana to Angola. 5500km through the rainforest - the greenest and at the same time blackest Africa. We all probably know Nigeria and have heard about Congo, but the tiny nations of Togo and Benin had something up their sleeves too. We went on good roads, bad roads and then hardly any roads. We wild-camped, hotel-camped, monastery-camped. We ate strange food and dreamed of better coffee. We got it once and even then it was Moroccan.

During the whole trip we met only two other white travelers and they were on bicycles. To say that we were the center of attention would be an understatement. Quite an experience, especially for me who previously outside of Europe had been only in Morocco.

The bikes used were Husqvarna Norden 901s. The original ones, only with upgraded suspension. There were some overheating issues, I hated the electronics (as a Tenere guy), the breaks seized at one point, a fork started leaking and the engine ran on one cylinder sometimes. With closest technical support probably only in Cape Town, we ignored all that and made it over the Equator and the mighty Congo river.

This ration has some very interesting components for sure! Too bad customs took both main dishes; farewell my lovely beef chili and pork meatballs!


Some components of interest:
1. Dates and walnut bar
2. Classic hummus (pic included)
3. Vegan lemon protein shake
4. Proteo Plus protein goo stuff (pic included)
5. Skimmed milk powder (went well with the muesli!)

Cocoa bar was good, chocolate was good, hummus and salty biscuit were great, muesli was great, coffee was great, date and walnut bar was....different, proteo plus had a great flavor but was very chalky/gritty, lemon shake had a nice light lemon flavor but was not my fav (I put a packet of skimmed milk powder in that drink too). Dried apricots with raisins was fantastic and so was the nuts and raisins mix!


I would recommend this ration for sure.

1i4fupx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1i4fupx/unexplained_anxiety_symptoms_and_management_tips/,Unexplained anxiety symptoms and management tips,"Hi all,

I’ve been dealing with physical symptoms that seem linked to anxiety, and I’m hoping to get some advice. My symptoms include:

* Dizziness
* Chest tightness/pain
* Tingling sensations
* Low mood and feelings of panic

These symptoms often follow accidental caffeine consumption (coffee, tea, chocolate, cola), but recently they’ve occurred without caffeine—most recently during the transition between jobs over Christmas and New Year. 

This has been an on-and-off issue since 2010, after a panic attack where I thought I was dying. All my ECGs and blood tests have been normal. I was on SSRIs until 2017 but stopped and prefer to avoid going back on them.

Typically, the symptoms have been less frequent in the last seven years. However, I’ve had two episodes in 2024, each lasting around two weeks, interfering with my ability to enjoy life or feel positive about the future. However, the recent one is ongoing, with good days and bad days.

What’s puzzling is that I don’t feel psychologically anxious—I don’t get a racing heart, sweaty palms, or other signs of worry. I suspect there’s an unconscious trigger at play, but the length and severity of these episodes make them difficult to manage.

Diet and lifestyle-wise, I consider myself very healthy:

* Daily exercise
* A plant-based diet with occasional fish, chicken, eggs, and dairy
* Creatine and seaweed supplements, no smoking or drugs, minimal alcohol

**My questions for the community:**

1. What could be causing these symptoms (root cause)?
2. Are there any tests (blood?) you’d recommend (e.g., for deficiencies)?
3. Could a vitamin deficiency be contributing to these episodes?
4. How can I better prepare for or prevent future attacks?
5. If symptoms arise, how can I reduce their severity?

Anyway, I'll write my deal breakers first so you don't have to keep reading if you're not interested.



1- Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with lots of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me.



2-  If you don't want a child for certain, that's a dealbreaker. I'm not thinking about having a child right now but in the future I might or not who knows,



3- If you're from Philippines, please don't ask why.



So if you made this far congratz. Let's continue.



I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.



I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.



My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or any religion. 



I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like. 



I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.



I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.



My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.



I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.



I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.



Also, I do care about physical attraction, please be available for selfie trading.

Sherri never walked when she could twirl, and she never stood still when she could sway. Life, to her, was one long choreography waiting to be discovered. From the rustle of her skirts to the rhythm of her sneakers on the pavement, every movement felt like a step in a grand performance—her performance.

As a barista at Percolate & Plié, a whimsical little café nestled in the heart of downtown, Sherri’s days were a perfect blend of espresso and expression. Her movements behind the counter were fluid and full of flair, as if pouring coffee demanded the grace of a ballerina. She narrated her every move under her breath like a voiceover in a movie: “And here she goes, the queen of caffeinated concoctions, pouring the perfect latte with an artful flourish. Note the swirl—it’s all in the wrist!”

The regulars adored her. Even the skeptics couldn’t stay grumpy as Sherri pirouetted her way to their tables, balancing trays like they were props in her own musical. But it wasn’t until she stumbled across the perfect soundtrack—one that seemed to sync with her every move—that her world transformed from charmingly chaotic to downright magical.

The music had a way of weaving into her day so seamlessly that it was as if the universe itself had decided to join her performance.

Sherri never walked when she could twirl, and she never stood still when she could sway. Life, to her, was one long choreography waiting to be discovered. From the rustle of her skirts to the rhythm of her sneakers on the pavement, every movement felt like a step in a grand performance—her performance.

As a barista at Percolate & Plié, a whimsical little café nestled in the heart of downtown, Sherri’s days were a perfect blend of espresso and expression. Her movements behind the counter were fluid and full of flair, as if pouring coffee demanded the grace of a ballerina. She narrated her every move under her breath like a voiceover in a movie: “And here she goes, the queen of caffeinated concoctions, pouring the perfect latte with an artful flourish. Note the swirl—it’s all in the wrist!”

The regulars adored her. Even the skeptics couldn’t stay grumpy as Sherri pirouetted her way to their tables, balancing trays like they were props in her own musical. But it wasn’t until she stumbled across the perfect soundtrack—one that seemed to sync with her every move—that her world transformed from charmingly chaotic to downright magical.

The music had a way of weaving into her day so seamlessly that it was as if the universe itself had decided to join her performance.

I got an orbit from one of the first drops and Acaia was kind enough to later swap my unit for a completely NEW grinder with the upgrades they made since the first batch, including the metal hopper that’s compatible with their large hoppers. Grinder was swapped in May 2023, so it’s been about 1.5 years of light use (i have two grinders).
Of the grinders I’ve owned (niche, df64, atom75) this has definitely been the most enjoyable to use. Workflow is great and super clean. Rpm control is great, the stock mazzer 33M burrs are definitely espresso focused but surprised me with pour overs (usually I used the lowest rpm for filter).
I’ve put various SSP 64mm burrs in here and the machining of the carrier it very good, and the ‘adjustment screws’ work mostly in place of shims which is nice.
Grind by weight with an Acaia lunar is also pretty cool, I tested it but ultimately just single dose. 

Selling because I’m downsizing my coffee gear. I put off listing this cause I really love using it, but I just don’t use it enough with the other grinders on bar. 

Selling this and a Lucca75 to fund a Wug2

I use 6x8in MDF sheets and $ store foam core for the bottom of my dioramas so those were the materials used to make a wilderness set where the scatter stuff could do the heavy lifting.

The tiles under graveyard are part of the first group I made. I ran out of flocking part of the way through, so made my own from old coffee grinds.The tiles under the road and cottage are flocked with my coffee grinds flocking.

The mausoleum on the left (Reaper Bone 6 add on) and center (3d printed) are dioramas which I posted here before. The mausoleum on the right (WIP posted here) was crafted from XPS and cardboard with a 3D printed door frame and the gargoyles. All have playable interiors (you can lift up the whole structure to access the inside).

The cottage along with the walls, road, trees, wagon and horses are 3d printed. Tombstones are cast from plaster, and the fountain and the minis are all from Reaper.

Also, American VA is on the whole, trash.","Seriously. Bison, and Yamazaki's VA especially is crazy good. I have no idea how Yama's actor sounds like he's using both sets of vocal chords independent of one another like a Mongolian throat singer when he shouts at the end of his Drill super, but fucking shit is it good. To be able to voice a character as utterly unhinged and frankly, as *ridiculous* as Yamazaki, and make him sound believable, is a feat unto itself.

Gesse's PREDICTABO is this game is the GOAT of PREDICTABOs. 

Literally anything the announcer says is pure, 24K magic.

Bison is the original hawk-TUAAAAH

Vice's VA is also particularly good.

Not Cammy's though. ""Shewt!"" No. No shewts, Cammy. Be quiet. Cammy sounds like a little field mouse that is just happy to be there. Field mice don't assassinate people. They look cute, get caught in traps, and infest grain silos. CVS2 is not a large silo of wheat. No. Bad casting director. nnnnNO.

The rest of the cast is solid AF. I can't think of any other VA in that game, that isn't just good, but great, and extremely well cast. The personality, the flair, the believability, it's all there in spades. 

Also if I could gush about Yama's VA juuuust a little more: The way his character is done- the fact that he only goes into his high-pitched, crazy-person routine when he gets violent and not otherwise, is well done. It really sells the unpredictable, hair-trigger, ""This dude should be locked in a padded room with a straight jacket somewhere"", nature of his character. The whole psychopathic ""mask of sanity"" thing. The fact that his actor still manages to sound menacing, even when speaking in his lower, calmer register is also super well done. That's some deceptively simple range, and I love it.

Not that any other incarnations of SF are worse, but CVS2 even today, is a shining example of well done VA.

I can NOT say the same for American voice actors in SF games. It's generally terrible. It's awkward, unbelievable, clunky, the same 5 voice actors get over-used, even the casting is god awful. Yes, the dude who plays Bison has a deep, booming voice and is intimidating... And it captures the personality of Bison like coffee mug with holes in it holds water. Chun's VA sounds weak, unsure of itself, and flat. Ryu has always sounded like a Skyrim NPC. I swear that guy ruins every game he's in. His VAs always sound like a 50 year old dude who just woke up from a nap on the couch, and is shouting at his 16 year old son to clean his room, in god-awful Japanese. TAHTSEW MAH-KEY SEN-POO-KEK. Terrible. Just terrible.

Don't even get me started on American VA's, attempting to use Japanese for special move voice lines. Total cringe.

Nice and compact Wiki by the way.

Can you recommend any tiny superautomatics?

Max size: 40x25x40cm, 15**¾**x10x15**¾**"" (depth x width x height).

Budget: 400$ (300$ ideal). No no-name brands though.

Target coffee type: Longer shots. Espresso secondary. No pour-over.

Milk, steamer & hot water functions: Not needed. Preferably without(!)

Region: Middle Europe, Austria.

Use Case: Will be taken out of a cupboard and put back afterwards for each use, therefore the space restriction. The homeowners are not coffee drinkers but want to be able to provide decent coffee for occasional guests. They had a capsule coffee maker before but want to switch to freshly ground coffee. (I informed them that coffee best be bought from a local roaster and will loose taste over time).

Preferably VERY easy to clean and service. They didn't know you need to descale your machine until theirs stopped working. They didn't believe me at first that descaling was gonna revive it and even confidently said that descaling was not needed... gave me a chuckle :3

They wanted to buy the Esperto2 Caffè from Tchibo initially, but I saw it would be too high (43cm) to fit into their cupboard.

1i4ff7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantarFasciitis/comments/1i4ff7l/taking_glucose_reading_to_lose_weight_to_cure_pf/,Taking glucose reading to lose weight to cure PF,"After hearing on this site that losing weight would help my PF, I started taking my glucose reading every morning by using a Keto Mojo monitor in an effort to lose 20-30 pounds. I've lost 5 pounds in the last 12 days and my pain is down to a 1, unless I do a lot of walking outside the home (inside, I seem to do okay on my wood laminate floors), but walking on concrete and store floors and such can jump the pain up to a 7 or 8, easily, so I try to get in and out of establishments as quick as possible. Just throwing this out there to help others and to see if anyone else has tried monitoring their glucose and succeeded. 

Taking my morning glucose reading has helped me get rid of all the sugar in my diet--so maybe the lack of sugar in my body is whittling down the pain too? If I eat a dessert, the next day my glucose can be as high as 143. If I have a Cafe Mocha at a coffee shop, it'll be in the 140's as well, so I've learned to order half sugar at some shops or half a pump of mocha sauce/syrup at other shops. Generally, I make my own sugar free coffee at home and just dump in some cocoa powder, plus I've learned to make my own little sugar free breakfast cookie.

Measuring my glucose has shown me that I've been eating more food than my body needed, so I just have my coffee and little cookie for breakfast, and then a larger meal for lunch or dinner, plus a snack of nuts somewhere in the day. This has gotten my morning glucose reading down to mostly the low 90's.

Anyway, I haven't been a member here on this sub for very long, so sorry if all this has been discussed before. I've had my PF for 2 months now. I find stretching the fascia while running the ball attachment of a hand massager (got mine at Costco for $50) crosswise across the fascia to be the best healing element in my routine, and then forming the alphabet letters with the foot before standing to walk or get up. Also, I wear a compression stocking during the day with new Hoka shoes or cushioned Sketchers (both with get insoles), then remove the shoes at night and wear a night splint while sitting on the couch, getting up to do things, and especially when I get up to go to the bathroom at night and in the morning. Have been slowly adding calf stretching and easy toe raises now that my pain is decreased (it didn't help to do these when the pain was horrific). I feel like I'm on the path to getting over PF--I just hope going to physical therapy in February doesn't make it worse.  
I did use ice at first when the pain was 6-10, then switched to heat when the pain was around 5. Also, I stopped my regular dancing/walking routines and just focused on stretching my whole body twice a day. I bought the Oofos recovery slides when my pain was around a 3-4. It hurt to wear them, so I stopped until the pain got down to a 2. I'm still not wearing them every day, just once in a while.

All in all, I feel for those who can't stay home or work from home for two months to focus on their PF because I think that's what helped me most. A friend of mine had PF for a year because she was always on her feet while working. On the bright side, hers hasn't returned for the past 10 years. Please let me know if tracking your glucose helped your pain or weight loss (I'm not trying to go into Ketosis, but maybe I should).",1,1737228971.0,PlantarFasciitis,0,0.67,False

I 27 f have been with my bf 28 for two years. We have lived together for a year and a half. His mom has never really been alone and asked if she could live with us when we moved in together.

Now until today I thought we had an awesome relationship. This women literally tells me I am her favorite child and how happy she is I am in her sons life, that I have made him so happy. I thought we had a great relationship. 

Now for the last year or so Ive being doing my nails with my amazing nail tech! She is amazing and just so happens to do my mother in laws nails to.

Today she told me that she couldnt stay quiet anymore and had to tell me whats really going on. News flash my world exploded. 

Apparently this woman has been praying yes praying ladies and gentlemen for me to dissappear and I kid you not God isnt taking me quick enough for her. 

Apparently I am a demanding Bitch whose controlling her son and the poor baby cant see how messed up I am. ( I literally do everything in the house, ie: cleaning her poop <she has stomach issues> from the toliet, cleaning the house,  washing everything) her son bless him loves to cook so he does that and sometimes he will make me coffee, which he does by himself, I dont ask. She sits like a queen, I chose this because I believe you should repect your in laws and do everything you can to help them.

I literally went into debt, I who do not beliven in debt and got through two degrees without it, with allot of work, to keep the house going when my bf lost his job.

She insists Im evil and a nightmare. 
Anyone who knows me knows I hate confrontation I deal with it enough at work, I argue for a living, make your own conclusions, I dont need it in my personal time.

It gets worse apparently my father, who struggles to show me his only child affection,his very reserved and quite, introvert all the way, whose been married to my mom for 30 years  and is always with me when his at my house btw, has been hitting on her calling her darling, and touching her inappropriately, leading to her having to slam a car door in his face to make him stop. NEVER HAPPENED!!

I dont know what to do apparently shes been telling these lies for months behind my back. If thats what she says to her nail tech what is she telling everyone else? 

I swear she is treated like a queen by me Ive never so much as raised my voice at her, I always try to help her with everything and anything she asks, I dont know where this is coming from?! 

I dont think my bf will believe me if I told him, I was shocked speachless and its not my mother.

The comments about me are one thing but my father why?

1i4f67s,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1i4f67s/tip_for_sleep_deprived_students/,Tip for sleep deprived students ,"Recently I've been quite sleep deprived because of mocks, so I had to figure out how to try to sleep the most.

Tip 1:

Since the amount I can sleep every night changes depending on the day, I try to make the most out of days I know I will be able to sleep more.

For me it's fridays (or sat) and tuesdays. Fridays because I don't have to wake up early and Tuesday's because school starts later. So what I do is I take a melatonin gummy once at like 7pm those days and sleep at 8-9. This solves the issue of not being tired so not sleeping on days where u actually have time to sleep early. 

It is important to not do this more than twice a week, melatonin has side effects (u can start relying on melatonin to sleep). Also idk if I would take pills since those are stronger but might have more side effects. 

Tip 2: caffeine 
So I'm not a big coffee drinker, I get anxious and I don't wanna rely on coffee. 

But what I do love is milk tea which has black tea and milk. Black tea does quite have a good amount of caffeine, not as much as coffee. So I drink like a big cup of milk tea every morning (taking it to school) and then one after class before studying if I'm exhausted. 

I actually make bubble tea (🧋 milk tea and tapioca) which makes it tastier !!

After months of hard work (and countless cups of coffee), I’ve finally launched my SaaS website! It went live just yesterday, and I couldn’t be more excited—or nervous. 😅

The website is [textcaseconverter.net](https://textcaseconverter.net), and the idea is simple: it’s a tool to quickly and easily convert text between different cases (uppercase, lowercase, title case, etc.). It’s designed to be fast, user-friendly, and completely free to use.

Now, here’s where I need your help. I want this tool to be as useful as possible, so I’m looking for your feedback on everything:

How does the website look and feel?
Is it easy to use?
Are there any features you think are missing or could be improved?
Any bugs or issues you came across?
Even if it’s just a quick visit, I’d love to hear your thoughts—whether it’s praise, criticism, or ideas for the future. This is still very much a work in progress, and your input will help me shape it into something even better.

So, what do you think? I’m ready for all the constructive feedback you can throw my way. Let me know what you like, what you don’t, and what you’d like to see next!

I'll stay in Odense for two nights and will have two whole afternoons free.

I'd like to spend one afternoon south of the train station and one north.

What can I do/see for a few hours each day?

South - HC Andersen museum and a walk through the general area and surrounding streets, I'll check out Kongens Have. I'd like to have a few more things to see or do, if it's not an issue, just mention if it's free or paid activity/site. I'd like to have a nice cup of coffee somewhere and maybe later grab some dinner.

North - no idea at all, but would like a similar plan. Something to do, something to see, grab a cup of coffee and have something to eat.

Any areas that would be better to avoid?

I have a few more general questions - do I need any cash at all? I assume a credit card will be ok for everything. I've never been to Denmark - is it normal to smoke while walking around or would I look like an idiot? Is it ok to carry a small swiss army knife in public in Denmark?

Then wooden decking like material for the boardwalk and finally asphalt and soft grass back to the van. I was worried if I’d be able to manage it but it was great and I had a sense of achievement when I got back to the van. So I drove to Costa Coffee and went in barefoot, ordered a coffee and sat down. This was probably the biggest mistake. After about 2 hours reading manga and looking at social media I decided to go home. So I stood up and immediately noticed 2 problem.

Mast cells are seated in a high-tech room, monitoring radar screens and scanners that detect potential threats. All is calm, until suddenly one of the radar panels starts beeping.)*

**Mast Cell #1 (Head of the Alert Center):**  
*(The ""Virus Threat"" icon on the screen flashes red.)*  
""ALERT! We’ve got an enemy virus in the system! Everyone on your feet, this is LEVEL 5 threat alert!""

**Mast Cell #2 (Overeager Rookie):**  
""A virus? Where’s the virus? I’m ready! Somebody hand me a histamine cannon; I’ll blast it all to pieces!""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
""Calm down, rookie. First, we follow protocol. Deploy all inflammatory mediators to the front lines!""

*(The mediators—histamine, tryptase, leukotriene, cytokines, and prostaglandins—gather in the room, weapons at the ready, prepared to charge into ‘battle.’)*

**Histamine (the most impatient soldier):**  
""Commander, I’m ready! I’ll start the sneezing, redness, and itching right away. Who needs peace and quiet when I can bring the party?""

**Leukotriene (calm but overly diligent):**  
""Yes, yes, I’ll handle the bronchial constriction—just enough to make every breath feel like an achievement.""

**Cytokines (three siblings speaking at once):**  
""We’ve got the fever ready! We’ve got the muscle aches ready! We’ve got the inflammation ready! Where to, boss?""

**Prostaglandin (tired veteran):**  
""Fine. I guess I’ll just deliver pain everywhere. Step aside, I’ll make it dramatic.""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
""All, move out! LESS TALKING, MORE RELEASING! We’ll crush this virus before it even thinks about attacking!""

*(The mediators spring into action. Histamine opens floodgates causing redness and itching. Prostaglandin ramps up the temperature. Leukotriene constricts airways slightly. Cytokines sound the inflammatory alarms. But something seems… off.)*

**Mast Cell #2:**  
*(The radar screen flashes a green icon: ""No threat detected."")*  
""Uh… Commander? It looks like… this wasn’t a virus. It was just a bit of dust.""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Lifting binoculars nervously to double-check the screen.)*  
""What do you mean, DUST? But the radar said it was a VIRUS!""

**Mast Cell #2:**  
*(Scratching his head.)*  
""Sorry, Commander. Looks like the dust cloud was misread as a virus.""

**Mast Cell #1:**

**Leukotriene:**  
""Bronchial constriction… FOR NOTHING?""

**Prostaglandin:**  
""Every bit of muscle ache I orchestrated was a masterpiece, and now I hear it was all wasted effort.""

**Cytokines (angrily):**  
""We gave the human a fever! A FEVER! The poor guy was sweating like crazy, and now you’re saying it was dust?""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Straightening up and trying to reassure the mediators.)*  
""Look, folks, we all make mistakes, right? The important thing is we’ve learned from this. Next time, we’ll double-check… and triple-check.""

**Histamine:**  
""And if it really is a virus next time, Commander? Can I just start itching right away?""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Scratching his head.)*  
""Yes, yes, sure. But let’s do a quick reality check first.""

**Mast Cell #2:**  
*(Relaxed tone.)*  
""Ah, finally some peace. How long do you think it’ll last, Commander? Do you think we have a couple of hours before...?""

*(The radar suddenly starts beeping.)*  
*BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!*  
""Enemy detected! Potential VIRUS inbound!""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Jumps to his feet, spilling coffee everywhere.)*  
""THIS IS IT! Everyone, get ready! Mediators, ASSEMBLE!""

*(The mediators glance at each other but don’t move.)*

**Histamine:**  
*(Suspiciously.)*  
""Are we sure about this one, Commander? That dust incident was pretty embarrassing.""

**Prostaglandin:**  
""Yeah, and my back was sore for three days after that last false alarm. Has the radar been tested?""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Eyes blazing.)*  
""I AM the radar! If I say it’s a virus, it IS a virus! Do you want to take the risk of letting this enemy roam freely through the body?""

*(The mediators groan and reluctantly rise, preparing for ""battle"" once again.)*

**Histamine:**  
""Fine, but if it’s dust or something like perfume again, I’m reporting this directly to Immune System Headquarters myself.""

**Leukotriene:**  
""My bronchi will never forget or forgive!""

*(Once again, symptoms erupt throughout the body—redness, itching, fever, sneezing, coughing, sore throat, muscle aches and rash. Mast Cell #1 stands confidently.)*

*(A few minutes later, the screen flashes: ""NO THREAT."")*

**Mast Cell #2:**  
*(Quietly.)*  
""Uh… it… it was just a hot cup of tea the human drank.""

*(Mast Cell #1 freezes, while all the mediators glare at him, dead serious.)*

**Histamine:**  
""Tea? We mobilized the entire system… FOR TEA? Do you remember what you got us into yesterday? The human just walked up the stairs, and we caused such a mess that he still haven’t gotten over it.""

**Leukotriene:**  
""Hot tea? I don’t like this job anymore.""

**Cytokines:**  
""Fever for TEA? This is humiliating.""

**Prostaglandin:**  
*(Exhausted.)*  
""I’m done. At this point, I’m convinced you just enjoy the chaos.""

**Mast Cell #1:**  
*(Composes himself, adjusts his collar, and speaks firmly.)*  
""Look, team, I understand we made a tiny mistake. But don’t you see? It’s better to err on the side of caution than to let a real virus slip through. I just… I just want to protect you all!""

*(A moment of silence. Everyone stares at him.)*

**Histamine** *(muttering):*  
""Protect us. Yeah, sure. Protect us from tea steam taking our heads off. We should protect this human!!""

*(Everyone walks off grumbling, leaving Mast Cell #1 alone. The radar beeps softly, and Mast Cell #1 returns to his mug.)*

**Mast Cell #1** *(to himself):*  
*(Whispering.)*  
""One day, they’ll appreciate my efforts. One day. But… it *could have been* a virus.""

*(The radar screen flashes: ""Parasite attack in the digestive system"" Mast Cell #1 jumps to its feet.)*

Hopefully it's a good palette cleanser from the heavier stuff, I guess?

My husband and I (29m and 26f) live with his mother (57f). I'm still in school, and my husband doesn't make enough at his job to afford us getting our own place, so we're here until I'm able to find work. 

I have ADHD, and because I live in a rural area in a very red state in the US, mental health resources are nonexistent. Therefore, I self-medicate with coffee and things with vitamin B12. I'm not looking for advice on how else to self-medicate the ADHD, I'm managing perfectly fine.

Because we're low-income, and because it's overall healthier, we buy powdered coffee creamer, usually from Walmart. I usually get hazelnut but sometimes get bored with it and like to switch things up.

The issue is that my MIL and I both like a caramel flavored creamer. She goes through A LOT of it. And she gets really pissy if anyone else touches her coffee creamer. So if I want the caramel coffee creamer, I have to get an entirely separate container for myself.

She has, in the past, accused me of stealing her food--and even her coffee creamer. The thing is, is that she never confronts me about it, she only gossips to my husband about it even though we've told her to come to ME when she has a problem with ME and if I do something wrong or if she suspects I've done something. We've even started to tell her that if she doesn't tell me directly when she has a problem, the issue doesn't exist. This way my husband isn't caught in the middle of arguments whenever she inevitably blames me for something that I'm completely oblivious to. This came after an incident where my husband brought home tomatoes from his grandmother's house, I ate maybe two of them, and apparently they were only for MIL? But neither my husband or I knew anything about it. Grandma sends stuff for all of us all of the time, so it was perfectly reasonable for me to be under the assumption that these tomatoes were for everyone. MIL asked me if they were good, I said they were, and then MIL proceeded to *text my husband while he was at work,* saying how awful I was for stealing her tomatoes--even though I had no idea they were for HER.

With the coffee situation, we have a setup to ensure that no one's coffee creamer is taken--I'm short and it's very hard for me to reach the top of the cupboard where the coffee creamer is stored. So, my creamer gets put at the bottom where it's easier for me to reach. MIL's creamer is on the top shelf, which she can easily reach. It's been working for the past few months and there haven't really been any problems.

Except for the past month, I've been buying the caramel creamer only for it to go missing off of my shelf. I've been fairly busy with school and my brother just spent the holidays with us, so I didn't really pay it any attention. But then my husband and I went grocery shopping yesterday and we bought two containers of the caramel coffee creamer--one for me, one for MIL. No big deal. (Food shopping is a whole other issue--her groceries cost about 2/3rds of what we get on a grocery trip, forcing my husband and I to not get any of the healthy stuff we need and forcing us into eating junk food. If we don't get her what she wants, she has a fit about it, and no, she doesn't leave the house. She doesn't even have a license.) We go home, put away the groceries, and I watched my husband put my coffee creamer on my shelf in the coffee cupboard.

But this morning, when I went to make coffee, I opened up the cupboard where the creamer's stored--and again, the creamer was completely missing, despite me KNOWING for a fact it was there last night. There are other things stored in that cupboard, and I saw it when I made dinner last night. My husband sleeps in because of work hours and is actually still in bed right now.

I'm not *angry,* I wouldn't even call it *annoyed.* More like disgruntled. Miffed? I don't know. It's a first world problem and a minor inconvenience, but still. That's my life!

How to Optimize Your Kitchen Space with Smart Purchases
-------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into a well-organized space can vastly improve your cooking and dining experiences. Smart purchases can help you maximize your kitchen's potential, turning clutter into efficiency. Here are some tips and product recommendations to optimize your kitchen space.

### Invest in Multi-Functional Tools

Choosing kitchen tools that serve more than one purpose is a smart way to save space. Here are some items worth considering:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Food Processor:** This versatile machine can chop, slice, shred, and even knead dough, reducing the need for several different appliances.
- **Instant Pot:** A pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, and steamer all in one. This gadget can help you prepare meals quickly while taking up less room in your cabinets.
- **Measuring Cup Sets:** Opt for stackable measuring cups that can nest together, saving valuable drawer space.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Efficient storage is key to a tidier kitchen. Invest in organizers that fit your needs perfectly:

- **Drawer Dividers:** These keep utensils and tools separated and easy to find.
- **Stackable Containers:** Use these to store food in a compact way. Clear containers help you see what you have without opening each one.
- **Wall-mounted Racks:** Install racks or hooks to keep pots, pans, and utensils off your countertops, making everything easily accessible.

### Optimize Vertical Space

Floorspace is often limited, but you can truly maximize what you have by looking upward. Here are some great ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Floating Shelves:** These can hold cookbooks, decorative items, or spices, keeping your counters clear.
- **Over-the-Door Organizers:** Use these on pantry or cabinet doors to hang cutting boards or spices.
- **Magnetic Knife Strips:** Rather than storing knives in a drawer, a magnetic strip can keep them visible and within reach while saving drawer space.

### Smart Appliances

Removing old, bulky appliances can free up lots of space. Replace them with modern, sleek alternatives:

- **Compact Microwave:** Look for models that easily fit on your countertop without taking up too much room.
- **Flat-top Electric Griddle:** These can be stored easily and are great for cooking larger meals without using multiple pans.
- **Under-Cabinet Coffee Makers:** These devices not only save counter space but also add style to your kitchen.

### Declutter Regularly

No matter how smart your purchases are, clutter can still accumulate. Make it a habit to declutter your kitchen periodically:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Check Expiration Dates:** Regularly go through your pantry and fridge. Dispose of items that have expired or you no longer use.
- **Evaluate Your Tools:** If you have gadgets that you haven't used in months, consider donating or selling them.
- **Limit Dishware:** Keep only essential plates, bowls, and cups to reduce your load in cupboards and drawers.

### Thoughtful Layout Changes

Sometimes, the way your kitchen is organized can impact your efficiency. An easy fix is to reevaluate how everything is set up:

- **Zone Arrangement:** Organize your kitchen by zones: a cooking area, cleaning area, and prep area. Each zone should contain the specific tools needed.
- **Easy Access:** Place what you use most often in accessible spots, while occasionally-used items can be stored higher up or further back.

By making strategic purchases and mindfully organizing your kitchen, you can create a space that is not only functional but also enjoyable to use. Remember, the goal is to make your cooking experience enjoyable, while ensuring that your kitchen remains clutter-free. Making the right choices can create a world of difference!

### Conclusion

A well-equipped kitchen is the heart of any home, and having the right Amazon home kitchen essentials can make your cooking experience more enjoyable and efficient. Investing in essential items like sharp knives, quality cookware, and reliable small appliances not only enhances your culinary skills but also simplifies meal preparation and clean-up. Remember, each tool you choose should serve a purpose and contribute to your cooking habits.

 Pedro and Ivo were brothers, linked to their grandmother. When she passed away, she left her house as an inheritance to both of them. The house was full of memories and the brothers quickly adapted, it was a space for coexistence and fun.

One day, while moving an old bookcase to clean the corner of the room, Ivo noticed something strange: a hidden door covered in years of dust and looking like it hadn't been used for decades on the wall, written “do not enter”.

But curiosity got the better of him, after a lot of effort, he managed to open the door. What he found on the other side left him speechless.

It was a wide, bright balcony, a table surrounded by flowering plants. The air was welcoming, ideal for an afternoon coffee. However, what really surprised him was when his grandmother came out of a smaller door at the end of the porch, with a serene smile on her face. Ivo was stunned. He tried to talk to her, ask her questions about her death, but she just smiled and said he was mistaken, as if she didn't know she was gone. She seemed happy, but never walked through the door that connected to the house.

Ivo, still in disbelief, decided to look for Pedro to share what he had discovered. When Pedro arrived home from college, he noticed that Ivo seemed disturbed.

— Where have you been, Ivo? You disappeared for three days! Our parents are worried!

— Three days? That doesn't make sense... I've been here the whole time — replied Ivo, confused. — I need to show you something.

When Pedro saw his grandmother on the porch, he was so perplexed and they talked to her, and Pedro soon realized that she had no idea she was dead. Although it was difficult for the brothers to accept the situation, they ended up enjoying the moment. Their company and chat were always pleasant, but there was something disturbing: every time they walked through the door, three days would pass in the real world.

Pedro began to visit her frequently, but this began to affect his life outside of there, he missed college, lost jobs and moved away from his family. Ivo tried to warn him, but Pedro couldn't resist the desire to be with his grandmother.

One day, Pedro disappeared for a month without hearing from him, and Ivo, distressed, decided to walk through the door again. Upon entering the porch, his grandmother appeared with the same smile as always, but this time, Pedro was beside her.

— Hi, Pedro... How long! — said Ivo, with a trembling voice.

Pedro just smiled. It was at that moment that Ivo understood that the door was not just a portal to see loved ones. Anyone who spent too much time there didn't come back. Pedro had died, trapped on the balcony next to his grandmother.

Now, in front of them, Ivo knew the price to be paid to enjoy that world. Despite his happiness, he understood the danger he was running, losing 3 days in the real world, so leaving the balcony, he felt the weight of the choice (real world and the comfort of that illusion). The door, with its secrets and powers, would remain there, testing those who dared to open it.",1,1737226473.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have two different sources, both are 8.5"" x 11"". One is a .docx in Word and Google Docs. The other are 16:9 slides from Powerpoint currently saved as PDF (with massive margins top and bottom to fill the landscape 11 x 8.5"" pdf).

He complained how difficult this has been to ""format"" since its so many pages. I knew I could figure it out... Especially with my secret weapon InDesign (having not used it in over 10 years). This has proven very difficult.

My current plan: configure InDesign template to my printers recs. Then place from either PDF or Word into InDesign, make small changes where needed, done. 

Blurb is the on demand printer I'm favoring. They offer a 10 x 8"" print size, then I would use 0.5"" margins and .875"" inside margin. I configured the frame to ""auto-fit"". A few pages would be manually adjusted to full page with bleed.

I have the template with frame just the way I want it. When I try to place from either Word or PDF nothing seems to respect the frame. They do not resize to fit inside the frame. And then there's the problem of placing like 600 pages... I have tried PDF script and Word (shift click) both having other issues.

brings my mood down.

Like texting will be sweet, I come over and am welcomed with a big hug, we watch something together and then cuddle to sleep.

The morning comes and even throughout the day sometimes, there’s a silence. It makes me feel like maybe I did something wrong but I don’t think I did.

I try to evaluate my own thoughts and feeling about this.

In the morning she stayed in bed until 10 am. That gives me a lot of anxiety. But I kept myself chill and then suggested breakfast. Once we decided my body just wants to get up and going but it takes her longer. One time she called me out for making her feel rushed and I apologized.

I told her I would go for a walk and when she asked why I said it’s because I want to get my blood flowing and don’t want to make you feel rushed so I’ll go for a walk until you come out, which probably gave her anxiety just hearing that alone.

I’ve been in my car for 10 minutes and just want to cancel breakfast and tell her I’m anxious and would rather just go home.

I know I can be anxious but at the same time it’s almost 11 am I usually get coffee and breakfast by like 8.

And then when we go out even when I take her out to places where she enjoys it sometimes at the end of the day I still feel like I get a cold shoulder like she is mad at me for something

Bella lived in a rundown trailer on the edge of a nowhere town. The walls were thin, the windows drafty, and the entire place smelled faintly of mildew no matter how many candles she burned. But it was hers or theirs, technically though her husband, Yaqub, never let her forget it.

“You’ve got time for all that TikTok nonsense,” he muttered one night, slamming the fridge shut, “but the dishes are still sitting in the sink.”

Bella flinched at his tone but didn’t look up from her phone. She was hunched over a cracked coffee table, sewing sequins onto a costume for her next cosplay stream. The dress wasn’t perfect.. nothing ever was but she was proud of it.

“Yaqub,” she said quietly, “this could actually go somewhere. You’ve seen the views I get. I’m building something.”

He snorted, leaning against the counter with a beer in hand. “Building what? A fan club of weirdos who like watching you dress up like a cartoon? Real impressive.”

Her hands trembled, but she kept sewing. She wasn’t going to let him get to her tonight.

TikTok was Bella’s escape. On her livestreams, she wasn’t the girl stuck in a crumbling trailer with a husband who barely tolerated her. She was a sorceress, a warrior, a hero in a world of her own making. Her followers adored her, sending her little gifts and messages of encouragement. They saw her in a way Yaqub never did.

But then came the news.

She was on her third coffee of the day, filming a quick TikTok in her handmade elf ears, when she saw the headline: “TikTok Ban Confirmed: Platform to Be Shut Down.” Her phone slipped from her hands and landed on the table with a dull thud.

“No,” she whispered, picking it back up. She scrolled frantically, hoping it was a joke, but every article said the same thing. TikTok was done.

Yaqub walked in, fresh from his shift at the factory, and noticed her pale face. “What now?” he asked, tossing his keys onto the counter.

“They’re banning TikTok,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Good,” he said, cracking open another beer. “Maybe you’ll finally start living in the real world.”

Bella’s chest tightened. “You don’t get it,” she said, standing up. “That app-… it’s not just some stupid hobby. It’s my chance to get out of here, to make something of myself.”

Yaqub laughed, a bitter, hollow sound. “Make something of yourself? You’re almost 25 and still playing dress-up. You think that’s a career? Wake up, Bella. No one cares.”

Her hands balled into fists. “They do care,” she said through gritted teeth. “I’ve got people who support me, who believe in me. More than you ever have.”

He stared at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he shook his head and walked out, slamming the door behind him.

Bella sank onto the couch, tears streaming down her face. She opened TikTok, scrolling through her feed like she was trying to memorize every video before it disappeared. Her fans’ comments flooded in under her last post: “Please don’t stop creating!” “We’ll follow you anywhere!”

She wiped her eyes and took a deep breath. Maybe Yaqub didn’t believe in her. Maybe the world was trying to snuff out her dreams. But she wasn’t going to stop.

Bella spent the next few days filming a goodbye stream in every one of her costumes, thanking her followers and promising she’ll be back one day..",2,1737226282.0,usagidarlingsnark,1,1.0,False

What I'm into: hiking and lifting are activities I enjoy because they are very therapeutic for me. Even though I’m an introvert and homebody, I’m always down to go out when it comes to trying local restaurants, boba and coffee shops, kbbq, etc. Most of the time, I like to play games and watch shows/movies, mostly anime or K-dramas.

What I'm looking for:

* Have some intro.
* I'd prefer it if we exchange pic early on. I understand that everyone has their own preference. Will send a pic if you send one
* Age: 35 is my limit unless you can change my mind. Not looking for underage.

Then around Thanksgiving at a party I was attending, I met this absolutely drop dead gorgeous woman. She's exactly my type and is incredibly kind and smart. I talked with her almost that whole night and did the same at a Christmas party a few weeks later. At the end of the Christmas party, when I told her I was leaving and wouldn't see her again until the new year, she smiled at me and gave me a full embrace, I was absolutely ecstatic.

I chatted with her a little over break over Instagram but nothing crazy.

Now the next semester has started and I have no classes with her and despite talking with her in those circumstances, I'm afraid I haven't talked enough with her to really move forward.

I'm trying to catch her outside of class or at the gym (we go to the same gym but go at different times and i don't know what her schedule is) to ask her for some coffee or smth but I'm absolutely lost. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",1,1737226232.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

My breakup was a little over a week ago, and the only thing I’ve been able to do is lay in bed for the most part. It’s almost like a safe space from confronting the hurt. The minute I leave my bed, I start to contend with memories in my room and I’m stuck in place. The guitar he played is in the same spot from where he last set it down, the mug he last drank coffee from is still on my bedside table. The best thing to do is for me to turn my back to it all and hide away. It’s almost as though disrupting anything will make it become more real. 

Listening to music? Forget about it. Those lyrics remind me of him. I haven’t showered in a few days, it’s time to look after myself. Oh shit - I forgot his spare toothbrush is in the cupboard. Now I’m crying in the tub. I need to get dressed, but last time I wore this sweater was before it all happened. I haven’t cooked in awhile, last time I did we were making a meal together. 

My best friend said I should get some sunshine, but the minute I step outside I’m completely paralysed. Our conversations span miles, cities. If I walk twenty minutes to the right, I’m outside of your house. My head can’t rest on your shoulder during late night bus or train rides anymore. I’ve called out of work because I hate my job, but I could always look forward to seeing you when the day was done. I guess I should go back inside. It’s funny, because if I peek out my window I can almost see your plans. The ones that you spoke of so proudly to show how good you’ve got it, how you know exactly how to move on. You’ve nailed the art of healing. I can almost see the bounce in your step when you pass me by. 

A lot of people say that a breakup is like someone ripping your heart out, but that feels too quick and violent. Because I felt your fingertips pushing against my ribs until they shattered like glass, and my heart was no longer cradled, it was extracted. So slowly that I could feel the sensitivity of my veins fraying, fighting desperately to stay in their place. With everything that they had. While it may not have been deliberate, you squeezed. And my pulse stopped. 

My friends are wondering if I’ll come out tonight, but I can hardly stand the look of the gaping hole in my chest. ",7,1737226181.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1i4ed5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4ed5r/update_1/,Update 1,"I’m sorry, everyone, but this is going to be a long one. I’ve been meaning to update for a while, but things have gone downhill, and I needed time to figure out how to even put this into words. I’m not sure how to update, so I just decided to make a new post.

First, I want to apologize for taking so long to respond to comments. The overwhelming response to my first post caught me off guard, and I had to take some time to evaluate everything that’s happened before sharing an update. Unfortunately, things did not go as I hoped, and my family’s response has left me heartbroken.

After my post, I decided to meet up with my “mom” (grandma) to talk things out. I thought maybe if we sat down, face-to-face, we could clear the air and find some understanding. I suggested getting coffee because I wanted it to be in a neutral, public place where we could stay calm. That idea completely backfired.

As soon as I brought up how I felt about finding out the truth, she exploded. She called me ungrateful, accused me of trying to ruin the family, and said I was selfish for being upset about “ancient history.” I tried to keep my cool and explain that I just needed time to process everything and figure out where we go from here. She wasn’t hearing it.

Then, out of nowhere, she threw her hot coffee at me. I was stunned—I didn’t even react at first because I couldn’t believe it happened. The coffee burned my face and chest, and I ended up having to go to urgent care for treatment. Thankfully, the burns aren’t too severe, but the emotional damage hurts far worse than the physical.

I know people will say I should press charges or file a lawsuit, but I can’t bring myself to do that. She’s still my mom in so many ways, and as much as she’s hurt me, I’m not in the mental space to handle the stress of legal action. It’s just too much for me right now.

After that, I decided to reach out to my “sister” (bio mom), hoping she could help me make sense of all this. At first, she agreed to talk, but she quickly changed her tune. She started blaming me for “dragging this all up” and said I should’ve just accepted things the way they were. When I asked if we could meet up to talk in person, she refused and said, “You’re the one making this a problem, not me.” That stung more than I expected.

It feels like both of them are ganging up on me, acting like I’m the one who did something wrong when all I’ve ever wanted was the truth. I feel completely abandoned by the two people I thought I could trust most in the world.

For now, I’m keeping my distance from both of them. I need time to heal—physically from the burns and emotionally from all the hurt they’ve caused. I’m seriously considering therapy because I know I can’t process all of this on my own.

Thank you to everyone who supported me on my first post. Your kind words have been a lifeline during this incredibly difficult time. I’ll try to keep you updated as I work through this, but for now, I’m just trying to focus on taking care of myself.",2,1737226126.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

This is our first time with NCL (we’ve only cruised with Celebrity before) and I had a few questions that I couldn’t find answers to on their app. 

1. What is all included in the unlimited soda package? On Celebrity we could get specialty coffees, juices, cocktails, etc. All I can find is that it includes Coke products. 

2. I see they have a Starbucks on board and a package to go along with it. I love Starbies but my husband does not; is it possible for only 1 of us to get the Starbucks drink package? Does the Starbucks include all the normal drinks or is it a limited menu?

3. How fancy (if at all) are we expected to dress for dinner at the on ship restaurants?

I know I'm underweight. I used to weigh 54kg but then I fell into extreme poverty and couldn't eat much for months. I fell down to 42 kg. My situation got better on the 30th of December and I gained one kg since. So that probably plays a role in it. 

For the past week, I've felt unusually tired. Like, ready to fall asleep anywhere and feeling lazy.  I constantly want to sleep. I'm not very active at the moment, stopped working out because I didn't want to lose further weight. Not only that but I also wake up a lot during the night, I had spotting in between periods (could be because of ovulation though as it happened two days before the ovulation day), and I feel like I'm not gaining my weight back as fast as I should? I mean, my brothers and sisters have gained 3-4 kg back while I didn't.

I don't know, I'm just hella worried and my appointment at my doctor is on February.

Note: I have a history of chronic stress-induced gastritis and otitis btw. In case this plays a role. ",1,1737225833.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The first time I saw him I was playing Barbie's with my younger sibling in front of the door to our basement. It's a small wall so there was a corner right next to us. We were playing and I say a shadowy man with a top hat on peeking through the corner and I looked over and he dipped back behind the corner. That repeated about three times before I looked to my sibling and told them to stay there before I got up and looked around the corner and I saw the shadow of a tall fancy man standing in front of me and then he tipped his hat with a bow and vanished.

Second time time I had just woken up, I had a loft bed, and I looked in the corner, just next to my closet with no doors. He was standing in between the closest and the chair in my room. I sat up and waved at him then he waved back, tipped his hat and vanished. Then I decided, well I'm awake I'll go downstairs and get a snack. I got out of bed and walked downstairs, halfway down the stairs I saw the hat man in thekitchen with a mug in had and when I got to the kitchen coffee was made and the mug was in the sink.

The last time was very brief, I was telling my friends about him and saying what a chill dude he is and then me and my friends walked past the bathroom next to my room and he was standing in the bathtub. He tipped his hat and vanished.",2,1737225717.0,HatMan,0,1.0,False

So there’s a girl in my college she’s just perfect according to me. 
I saw her for the first time in very early days of the college in the first week itself and it was literally love at first sight, time went by we talked a bit, not much to be exact and I don’t know why but I got attracted to her like she was a magnet pulling me closer.
After 2 months I told her that I’m attached to you I don’t know the reason but I’m attached she said that abhi to humne itni baat hi nhi ki h tu attach kaise ho gya and I had no answer to that and we stopped talking to each other from that day. Now almost 1.5 years have passed we have started talking again like very little, we even had a coffee together outside our college so I think we are on better terms now but man I’m still in love with her sometimes I just think that she’s too perfect for me she can get anyone better than me then why she will choose me. Please tell should I talk to her more or stop talking to her what to do…. She’s always on my mind I just want some clarity

Options 3-5 won't all fit but not sure which ones will work best.

Also, the entire house is being painted a warm white with white trim so no need to focus on the paint colors. :)

Our store is small, so I often am alone during my shifts. When I first started, this old man (about 75 I guess) came in asking for help because he couldn't access our app. The issue seemed to be that he forgot the password, so nothing I could do. But being new, and frankly thinking he was just a bit forgetful due to his age, I tried to help him. Well, while I tried to explain we couldn't do much, he randomly took my hands and started caressing me. He looked at me with a smirk and I instinctively took a step back, informing him to go and try at a phone store. 

I thought it was an isolated incident. I soon found out he did this with every single one of my coworkers and only once. He would come in, ask for help with the app, get inevitably close and try something. One, who was barely legal, got asked out for ""coffee and more""; an ex-coworker was touched as well. We shared our experiences, and we also noticed he often visits the mall with his wife. Of course, he doesn't try anything when he's with her. He comes by alone to do that. 

Apparently, only one of my coworkers hadn't been ""approached"" yet. It happened to her as well in November, but being aware of the situation, she kept a distance and he couldn't do anything. 

Well, perhaps he forgot that he'd already approached me because tonight he came in and tried it all again. As soon as he opened his mouth I told him I knew he used the app as an excuse to behave inappropriately with the girls in our store, and to kindly get out or I would inform a guard. As soon as I said ""inappropriately"" he was already running out, head low. 

Now, I know. There's worse cases scenarios. Some molesters are genuinely scary, while I could probably fight this old man with a feather and win. Girls in other malls had experiences with guys straight up jerking off in front of them. But still, it IS inappropriate, viscid, and nothing I want happening at the place I work. 

My coworker, the one who kept her distance, initially implied I might've overdone it because after all ""he's harmless and he only gets a bit touchy"" but she ultimately agreed with me. Still, it irked me. The whole situation does. I'm mad that I have to deal with this, and that I'm completely alone in thinking that being stern and direct was the only way with this pathetic man. That I'm alone in feeling disgusted because ""there's worse"" and that he gets the golden ticket of forgiveness because he's ""just an old man"" ",3,1737225373.0,rant,3,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something with all of you that I have been working on for the past couple months, a short documentary about Whyte Avenue in Edmonton, called Offwhyte, which will also be screening at Edmontons own, Metro Cinema on Sunday, January 26th, 2025 at 1:00 pm. Whyte Avenue is more than just a street to me; it’s a place filled with memories, stories, and a unique vibe that is unlike anything else. It is truly a one of kind destination.

Whether it’s grabbing coffee at one of the cozy cafés, catching live music at a tucked-away venue, or wandering the art-filled streets staring at the buildings, Whyte has always felt like the heart of Edmonton. It’s where I’ve celebrated, reflected, and connected with people who’ve become lifelong friends.

In this documentary, I tried to capture the soul of Whyte Ave through my lens. The people, the culture, and the unique characteristics that make it special. I spoke with business and filmed the residents, and street performers of Whyte!

When I introduce myself with my first name to native English speakers, I am often met with a certain incredulity. When I follow up with my family name, hilarity usually ensues

In my native language of Norwegian, odd doesn’t mean strange but *pointed*. More specifically it points to the pointed head of an arrow. A pre-Christian myth tells of how arrowhead turned into a name due to of a man who was an avid seeker of truth. One day this man asked the Norse gods to turn him into such an arrow’s odd, and for this arrow not to stop until it hit the goal of ultimate truth. The gods promised to fulfill the man’s wish. The man was transformed into the odd of an arrow, and the gods ordered the strongest man in the village to release this arrow from his bow. According to the myth, that arrow is still roaming the skies and will forever continue to do so. Ultimate truth can never be hit, caught or seized. Its very nature is impermanence – flux

I hope this story didn’t leave you with vertigo. If so, here are some words of comfort, courtesy of late Tibetan Buddhist master Chögyam Trungpa: The bad news is, you’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there is no ground.

This site is dedicated to spreading the word about a concept called Transduality. Transduality claims that what’s inside of you isn’t fundamentally separate from what’s outside of you. A book on Transduality would easily risk being placed in the Mysticism section of your local library. But there really isn’t much mystical about it. There are no virgins giving birth or old men parting the Red Sea involved. None of that. It simply entails the down-to-Earth observation that separation doesn’t seem to be fundamental to life. Anyone can test the hypothesis for themselves. No tools are needed. No money. No academic degree or years of dedicated spiritual practice either. If you can read these words, that is enough

https://preview.redd.it/s1590q82qsde1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=688f0f8be5f8bfc622f3d99503edcda23b4274fc

The whole philosophy of Transduality takes only a moment to explain, so please allow me to do so. In fact, let me use this very moment that you and I share here and now to explain it. Just notice how, looking outwards, this moment doesn’t end at the screen in front of you, or at the wall behind it. Nor at the horizon or at the border. It doesn’t end at the outer reaches of the atmosphere, and it doesn’t even end at the end of the universe, whatever that may mean. Everywhere we can and cannot go, it’s the same moment. This one.

Looking inwards, notice how this moment doesn’t end at the perimeter of your skin. Nor does it end at the gate to your heart or your brain. This moment transcends and includes everything, including you and I

me. We are both manifestations of this infinite moment that we share here and now. Or, more poetically speaking; We are leaves on the same tree of life.

And yet, since before we can speak, we are taught that we are fundamentally separate beings – headquarters placed somewhere behind the eyes. Cut off creatures doing our best to survive in an alien world out there. The cornerstone on which the whole edifice of duality rests, that separation is fundamental, is easily dismantled. It relies only on the thought, ‘I’m fundamentally separate from what’s outside of me.’ This thought has nothing to back it up. Neither logic, the sciences, or any other quarter gives any credence to this notion.

The challenge is this: We live in a world or matrix that is built on this assumption. The platform we all stand on rests upon it. Even if we try to step out into the unknown we will sooner or later gravitate back to the matrix of duality, since there isn’t yet another platform to stand on.

During the recent pandemic I felt impressed by friends on SoMe using their spare time to learn new skills. This woman in particular served as an inspiration:

https://preview.redd.it/vfnro7gnosde1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4c7879455ca91d990daad7ee97f69f1581957b8

I’m not really a coffee drinker though, so I decided to have a go at making sushi instead, as I positively love the stuff. Here’s how that went:

https://preview.redd.it/2j2zyzoqosde1.png?width=280&format=png&auto=webp&s=07e8f54f14cc48835883342b73b7f30a60e2d209

After this setback my spirits were again lifted when I read that Newton had spent quarantine during the great plague of 1665 inventing calculus, formulating a theory of universal gravitation, and doing groundbreaking work on the nature of light. I ended up doing the very same thing during covid! Well. except for the calculus, gravity and light bits. Here’s an actual snapshot of what I did bring back to the world after my own quarantine:

https://preview.redd.it/you2av6tosde1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=76feccd328ea0f3c3e7a30a2d78f2d606b6757e4

That picture doesn’t tell the full truth. I did actually invent a three-pronged cellular cure for the duality disease during the pandemic: the Single, Double, and Poly Cells of Transduality. Together these Cells will create a new matrix, a new platform to stand on. Am I comparing myself to the great man himself? Why, of course not. I have much better hair, and my finely tuned sixth sense would never allow falling fruit to ruffle my mop.

If, to paraphrase the Wu-Tang Clan, duality rules everything around me, does talking about Transduality turn me into this guy?

Shiver me timbers, I hope not. This next image may occasionally hit closer to home though…

https://preview.redd.it/vvpw3k9apsde1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db9aa8d835b7808bbbaad6eeabc170a64c1f19e

But mostly, not even that. I’ve spoken to tons of people about Transduality, and I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t resonate with its ideas. No one really believes in the gospel of duality anymore. We have all seen how it produces conflict, lack of connection, and environmental destruction. And we have all experienced glitches in the matrix of duality, what I call NLEs (Near-Life Experiences), where the unbearable heaviness of being is replaced by lightness.

Maybe in a house of worship. While meditating, doing yoga or breathing exercises, or taking a Wim Hof style ice bath. Or dancing your ass off at a rave where God is a DJ. Maybe on attending or participating in a sports event. While watching the Super Bowl, catching a wave, trekking in beautiful nature, or participating in a game of wine volleyball. Or at a concert, playing in a band, singing in a choir, or banging away in a drum circle. Maybe after a particularly satisfying day at work. While having a heart to heart with a trusted friend. Or living those magical first six months of love. Making love. Tripping on psychoactive drugs…

https://preview.redd.it/eozcqjwepsde1.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e0442796b2c6ea7a515bd5dd9ce42cb490e4bd4

But the high always ends. Back to life, back to duality. Such experiences of lightness and connection come from having the weight of the world off our shoulders, if only for a short while. When we mistake the line between us on the inside and everything else on the outside to be fundamental, that’s what we get. The weight of the world placed firmly on top of us. No amount of dedication, meditation or medication will change this fact. A fundamentally separate self sinks like a stone when chucked into the deep waters of reality. We must flog that dead horse to keep it afloat, rendering life into the slide of an unprotected knee over a never-ending gym floor. The fluid flow of life morphed into science friction.

So, we’ve seen through the limitations of the duality OS. Transduality offers a clear upgrade, a smoother OS that isn’t at constant loggerheads with the reality we’re trying to navigate. But how do we get there from here?

Great Integral philosopher Ken Wilber claimed that the German Idealists were the modern Western philosophers who came closest to the conclusions reached by the most interesting Eastern traditions – conclusions I would call transdual. The problem, according to Wilber, was that the Idealists lacked a yoga, vessels other people could sail to reach the shores of those conclusions themselves. The cells of Transduality are designed to be such vessels, and you are hereby invited to climb onboard your own vessel and sail to the other shore.

If you want to be part of helping the world finally become what it could have been long ago if MTV would have just kept playing music, while simultaneously seriously upgrading the quality of your own life, you should consider checking out my book:  
[The Cure – philosophical first aid for a world that can’t breathe.](https://transduality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/the-cure-1.pdf)  
It is and will always remain free of charge. In fact, Transduality only has two rules, and the first rule is that money should never be involved in Transduality. To learn the second rule, read the book. To read up on everything Transduality, go [here](http://transduality.com).

1i4dmox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1i4dmox/hilton_whistler_resort_spa_review/,Hilton Whistler Resort & Spa review,"My wife and I wanted to book a ski trip over the Christmas break since we both had off and it beats twiddling our thumbs in FL.  We settled on the Whistler Hilton 12/27/24-1/1/2025. It was 320,000 points when I booked for five nights, and the cheapest non refundable rate at that time would have worked out to be $5000 USD for the stay.

We took a shuttle from downtown Vancouver using the sky lynx service.  For an extremely busy week the bus was empty and the ride was enjoyable.  The bus dropped you off about a five minute walk from the entrance to the Hilton, which took us about 15 minutes because we missed the small Hilton sign and the entrance was kinda hidden.

Made our way to the front desk an hour before checkin just wanting to unload our ski gear.  It turns out the room was ready.  I asked if there were any upgrades for diamond but the hotel was full, which was expected.  We stayed in room 450.  The room was nice, but not $1000/night nice.  If I paid cash i would have been disappointed.

The room had a comfortable bed and a nice view of the much nicer Westin across the street.  TV was huge and modern where you could link up to your own Netflix accounts and whatnot. Tons of closet space for snowboard gear and lots of dresser space to unpack a weeks worth of cold weather gear.  They also had a rubber mat for ski boots which was nice.  As a typical American I love my air conditioning and the Hilton delivered.  We would leave our window cracked while out for the day and it was perfect sleeping temperature.  They had a kitchenette but we only used the mini fridge.

The breakfast buffet was free the first 4 days but the hotel changed its policy on our last day, starting 1/1/25 and we had a $24 credit each since I was a diamond member? The buffet was slightly better than a Hampton inn as in the food was actually edible but it was pretty weak in my opinion. (Wife loved it though.). I would not pay $40 for that.. On the day of checkout we just got a few coffees and breakfast Sammies at the coffee shop which was covered by the $48.

For the skiers out there, it was very close to the lifts.  It was under a 5 minute walk from the time we left our room to waiting on a line at the gondola.  There was a Whistler gondola at the base, a quad that takes you up the Whistler side and the Excalibur gondola which takes you up the Blackcomb side.  The quad had the shortest wait.

At the end of the day you ski down to the village and can quickly drop off your ski/snowboards near the side entrance of the hotel through a third party company.  You just tell them your room number and they take it from there. We did this most days.  There were a few bars/apres spots right outside of the Hilton entrance. (Blacks, Longhorn, Garibaldi Lift Co and an Irish place). Restaurants line the village and there’s about 15-20 within a ten minute walk. The apres scene at cinnamon bear was pretty lively, without being rowdy.  

They had free daily activities at Cinnamon Bear.  We did the wine tasting and local beer tasting.  Both were great. The manager there did the wine tasting and she was great. (Forgot her name.) Overall it was a pleasant stay.  It was a little pricey but it’s ski season, so kind of expected.  I’d give it about a 4/5.  A very nice hotel, with a great location and great amenities.  It’s certainly not quite a luxury hotel but it’s way above a Hampton/HGI.",6,1737224153.0,Hilton,2,0.88,False
1i4dmhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1i4dmhv/pacific_northwest_wine_dinner/,Pacific Northwest Wine Dinner,"I am preparing a menu for a Pacific Northwest wine pairing. There will be 2 samples of four types of wine. One representing a lower cost quality wine and the other representing a classic high end example typically 3-4x the cost of the value wine. Wines are paired with food, tasted blindly and rated. The four types of wines will be Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, all from the Pacific Northwest. I am looking for menu suggestions that reflect typical PNW cuisine. 
Here are my initial ideas

Start with a baby kale, goat cheese and dry tart cherries. 

Chardonnay: 
-a lobster or Laguionie dish. 
-Dungeness crab, although this may be difficult to get in Western Pennsylvania.  
-Halibut cheeks
-A dish based on lobster mushrooms 

Pinot Noir:
-Cedar plank or Smoked Salmon 
- A turkey dish ( turkey tenderloin with cranberry Pinot noir glaze)
-teriyaki chicken

Syrah
- roast lamb with Marionberry-pecan crust
-pork with marionberry blackberry sauce 
- duck with a hazelnut marionberry sauce

**Chapter III : Sister in a Coma**

For hours, Maya's life had hung in the balance, entrusted to the doctors. Coco’s quick response, followed by the arrival of the paramedics, had prevented the worst: finding Maya lifeless in the morning.

In the waiting room, the Schoppenboer family endured an excruciatingly long wait, held hostage by uncertainty. Mr. Schoppenboer paced back and forth, unable to stay still. Beside him, his wife tightly held the hands of their adopted children, trying to pass on some semblance of comfort despite the heavy anxiety weighing on them.

At last, after what felt like an eternity, a doctor approached and invited them into his office. Once the family was seated, the doctor, in a neutral tone tinged with some reassurance, spoke: ""**I’ll be brief: your daughter Maya is out of danger. We managed to stabilize her.**""

A collective sigh of relief filled the room as worry-stricken faces lightened a bit. But the doctor continued: ""**However, we had to place her in a medically induced coma. She lost a lot of blood, and we’re concerned that the massive hemorrhage may have reduced oxygen supply to her brain. This precaution aims to minimize the risk of long-term complications.**""

These words stirred a new wave of anxiety. Maya had been saved, but the specter of potential complications loomed over them.

“**How long might this coma last ?**” Mr. Schoppenboer asked, his gaze tense.  
“**If all goes well, one or two days. In the worst-case scenario, it could last two to three weeks,**” the doctor replied cautiously.

A heavy silence fell over the room, laden with unspoken thoughts. After a few moments, Mrs. Schoppenboer asked in a trembling voice : “**Can we see her ?**”

The doctor nodded and led them through the hospital's long, cold corridors. When they entered the room, the sight before them left them breathless. Maya lay on the bed, intubated, connected to a myriad of machines monitoring her condition. Her wrists were bandaged, and her skin, eerily pale, stood out against the stark white sheets.

Overwhelmed, Mrs. Schoppenboer asked the doctor if they could have a few moments alone. He nodded silently and left the room.

The mother pulled up a chair next to the bed and sat down, her trembling hands trying to stifle sobs she could no longer hold back. Her adoptive children and husband stood behind her in silence, their gazes fixed on Maya.

In a broken voice, Mrs. Schoppenboer murmured, “**Maya… please come back to us. We love you more than anything. We’ll face all of this together, I promise… but please come back to us…**”

After a few minutes spent contemplating Maya, the Schoppenboer family left the room, leaving her alone with the cold company of the medical machines. The oppressive silence followed them to the hospital cafeteria, where they hoped to satiate the hunger gnawing at their stomachs since the previous evening. Their meal was frugal: a few drinks and pastries were enough to nourish their bodies but not their minds.

After some silence, Mrs. Schoppenboer spoke: “**Last night, after dinner, your father and I talked. We felt something was wrong. We’d decided to have a family discussion as soon as possible. We thought it was just a teenage crisis or minor troubles… But in reality, the problem was far deeper than we ever imagined. Did either of you notice anything unusual about Maya recently ?**”

An awkward silence fell over the table. Then Coco, hesitant, finally stammered, “**I… I have to confess something… Last night, I lied when I said I got hit by a rugby ball at practice. Maya… Maya and I were talking, and… I said something that made her absolutely furious. And… and… she hit me…**”

Her voice broke as tears began streaming down her cheeks.

The parents, stunned by this revelation, exchanged incredulous looks. Their biological daughter, so quiet and reserved, had struck her adoptive sister hard enough to leave physical marks.

“**But… please, don’t be angry with her.**” Coco continued between sobs. “**She said some very harsh things to me, it’s true. But she also wanted to hurt herself afterward… She must have had so much hatred and resentment bottled up inside, and it all just exploded.**”

The family spent the rest of the morning discussing what could have caused Maya’s distress. Coco, trying to piece her memories together, mentioned fragments of their argument. She brought up the story of the cat, then admitted to threatening to push Maya out of the school window after a comment she made about their parents.

This revelation deeply shocked her adoptive parents. Their anger was evident, but they decided to postpone the conversation.

“**I think, in the end, Maya felt excluded, both at home and at school.**” Coco concluded. “**And she blamed me for that. That feeling made her miserable, but we realized it far too late.**”

Mr. Schoppenboer stood up and left the table to make some important phone calls. The family needed to be informed of Maya’s situation, and the school administration had questions about the absence of the three children.

Meanwhile, Coco and Mymy were so absorbed in their conversation that they didn’t notice the notifications on their phones. Mymy had received a message from Kiki, worried, asking if everything was okay and if ""it wasn’t contagious,"" naively believing that the three sisters had caught a virus. Coco, on the other hand, received messages from Yfke, Cleo, and Zoey in their shared group chat, all seeking updates on their friend and concerned about her unusual silence.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The school break was coming to an end at Maya, Mymy, and Coco's school. In the teachers' lounge, the staff were chatting about trivialities, most of them disillusioned with a profession that had shattered their ideals.

Sitting aside, Vera, the history teacher, discreetly added a drop of alcohol to her coffee. It helped her get through the day, especially when she had to deal with Mymy, a student she found insufferable and unpredictable.

Suddenly, the principal entered the room and addressed her directly: ""**Vera, may I speak with you for a moment ?**""

Once in private, he went straight to the point: ""**I just got off the phone with Mr. Schoppenboer. His daughter Maya attempted suicide last night. The doctors managed to save her, but she is currently in a medically induced coma.**""

Vera froze, shocked by the news, nearly dropping her Nirvana-logo mug.

""**Her sisters, Mymy and Coco, are at the hospital with her. They won’t be attending today.**"" the principal continued. ""**Could you inform their classmates and offer support? Also, remind them the school nurse is available if needed.**""

Vera nodded, though with a heavy heart. Walking to the classroom, her thoughts raced. She looked at Maya’s empty chair and felt a wave of sadness wash over her. Although she often found the student enigmatic, she saw wasted potential in her. For the first time in her career, Vera had to handle the impact of a suicide attempt among her students—a task that almost overwhelmed her.

The bell rang, and students began filing into the classroom, intrigued by the grave look on their history teacher’s face, so different from her usual demeanor.

""**Please sit down.**"" she said in an unusually solemn tone.

She observed them for a moment, the weight of the words she was about to speak bearing down on her.

""**You’ve probably noticed that Coco, Mymy, and Maya are absent today.**"" she began before pausing. ""**I have to inform you that Maya tried to take her own life last night.**""

A shocked silence fell over the class. Nervous murmurs arose, but most students were frozen in place, stunned. Yfke and Koos, still under the effects of substances consumed earlier, seemed more detached than distressed.

""**She is out of danger.**"" Vera continued. ""**But she has been placed in a medically induced coma to prevent complications. Mymy and Coco are at the hospital with her. Please know that I’m here if you want to talk, and the school medical team is also available.**""

The rest of the hour was largely spent discussing Maya. Vera, usually reserved, displayed an unexpected empathy.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later at the hospital, Mymy and Coco, caught up in a family conversation, finally noticed the messages on their phones.

Mymy read Kiki’s:  
“*Mymy, I heard about your sister. I’m here for you. If you want, I can come see you.*”

Cleo had written to Coco:  
“*It’s awful what happened. We’re all here to support you. Don’t hesitate if you need anything.*”

Zoey, and even Yfke—once she had recovered from her trip and realized the gravity of the situation—sent messages full of comfort and support.

These words brought some warmth to the two sisters, making them feel less alone in this ordeal. They asked their parents if their friends could visit in the afternoon. With their agreement, they informed their friends that the house would be open to welcome them later.

The Schoppenboer family returned home in the afternoon, feeling that waiting pointlessly at the hospital wouldn’t achieve anything. They wanted to clean up and prepare the house for Coco and Mymy’s friends.

A difficult sight awaited them : the bathroom still bore traces of the previous night’s tragedy. Blood splattered surfaces, and reddish water lingered in the sink. Without a word, the father set to work cleaning the grim scene so that everyone could use the room again without reliving the trauma.

Meanwhile, Coco stood at Maya’s bedroom door. An inexplicable impulse urged her to enter, as if doing so might help her understand what had driven her sister to such an act. Entering the room, she noticed a piece of paper neatly placed on the desk.

Heart heavy, Coco picked up the paper and opened it. The first few lines felt like twin daggers : the first, upon reading how much Maya hated herself, drowning in unbearable pain; the second, realizing that their argument had been the breaking point—the catalyst for the tragedy.

Maya’s written words echoed in her mind, amplifying a crushing sense of guilt. Tears streamed uncontrollably, and her sobs filled the house. Her distress quickly drew the rest of the family to the room.

Coco, her hand trembling, handed the farewell letter to her parents. They read it silently, their faces pale. The emotion became overwhelming. The mother, devastated, collapsed into tears beside Coco, hugging her tightly. Mymy, shaken, joined them, letting her grief flow freely. The father, trying to stay strong for his family, couldn’t stop silent tears from running down his cheeks.

In that shared moment of pain, they made a promise: to remain united through this terrible ordeal and to do everything to help Maya find a reason to live once she woke from her coma.

Coco and Mymy's friends arrived together late in the afternoon, as planned. While Kiki and Mymy locked themselves in the latter's room, Cleo, Zoey, and Yfke stayed in the living room with Coco, accompanied by her parents. Over hot drinks and stroopwafels, they shared a simple yet comforting moment. The girls’ presence brought a bit of warmth to a house marked by pain. Before leaving in the early evening, they promised Coco and Mymy that they would always be there for them.

To lift everyone's spirits, the Schoppenboer family decided to order pizza. After the meal, Mrs. Schoppenboer had an idea: to take out the family photo albums. They settled on the couch and dove into old memories. Each photo brought back anecdotes and smiles, sometimes tinged with melancholy. But as they flipped through the pages, one thing became glaringly obvious: over the years, Maya’s smile seemed to fade. In the most recent pictures, it was completely gone.  
“**It was all there, right in front of us… and yet, we didn’t see it.**” murmured Mrs. Schoppenboer, her voice choked with emotion.  
That evening, all their thoughts were with Maya, hoping she would wake up soon and without any lasting damage.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, Vera had only one thought after school: to go home. She had experienced her share of shitty days at this school where she taught, but this one took the cake. Since she learned about Maya, she couldn’t think about anything else.

Arriving at her small apartment — the kind of place owned by a woman who had long since buried her dreams and stopped believing she could ever appeal to anyone — Vera did what she always did after a crappy day. She reached for a bottle of wine. After grabbing a glass from the kitchen, she collapsed into her armchair. That glass wouldn’t be the only one tonight.  
But just as she was about to pour the wine, she froze. Bottle in hand, she stared at the dark red liquid. A thought crossed her mind: she was destroying herself, slowly but surely. She thought of Maya. She, too, had taken a path of self-destruction, except hers had led to a fatal gesture.

Vera stayed there, motionless, contemplating the bottle as if she were weighing its symbolic weight. Then, with a determined gesture, she set the glass aside, walked to the sink, and poured out the wine. The glugging sound of the liquid disappearing down the drain had an eerie resonance.  
She then put away the glass and picked up her electric guitar. Returning to the couch, she spent the rest of the evening playing, her fingers running over the strings with an intensity she hadn’t felt in years.

That night, Vera chose not to sink.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, Coco and Mymy prepared to return to school. Their parents wanted their adopted daughters to quickly resume a normal routine, which both sisters supported. A plan was put in place for Maya: her sisters would visit her in the hospital after school, while their parents would take over in the evening after work.

At school, Coco and Mymy became the center of attention. Students offered support and sympathy: some proposed help, while others suggested gifting things to Maya once she woke up.  
Before classes began, Vera asked the two sisters to come to her office. She seemed more composed than usual — likely thanks to her sobriety the night before — but also visibly shaken. Once they were seated, Vera spoke with an unusual compassion in her voice: “**I heard what happened to your sister. Please know that I’m here for you, whether you need someone to talk to or any kind of help. You don’t have to face this alone. Take all the time you need.**”  
Vera’s words, surprisingly sincere, brought a timid smile to the sisters’ faces. Coco replied with gratitude: “**Thank you so much for your support. We’re going through a tough time, but we’re hopeful she’ll pull through. We’ll stay united through this.**”  
The bell signaling the start of classes ended their conversation. Before letting them leave, Vera asked them to keep her updated on Maya’s condition.

The school day passed without incident, though Coco and Mymy felt an omnipresent emptiness. Maya’s empty desk weighed on the classroom’s atmosphere.  
After school, the two sisters rode their bikes to the hospital. Upon arriving at the care unit, they found Maya’s condition unchanged: still no signs of consciousness. They stayed by her side, silently hoping for a miracle.

After a while, Mymy broke the silence: “**I think I really fucked up with Maya… I haven’t always been nice to her. I thought we were joking sometimes, but I think she didn’t see it the same way. I said things she didn’t take well.**”  
Coco nodded and added, somewhat sternly: “**Like the time you did that awful Belgian accent and said her concentration issues could be fixed in a concentration camp ?**”  
Mymy nodded, her gaze fixed on the floor, crushed by guilt.  
Coco placed a comforting hand on her shoulder: “**What’s done is done. What matters now is making sure she feels good in the future**.”

Later in the afternoon, their parents arrived at the hospital after work. The family was joined by Maya’s doctor, who came to give them an update:  
“**We believe Maya won’t suffer any major lasting effects. We’re going to start waking her up.**”

Relieved by the news, Coco and Mymy returned home, leaving their parents with Maya. Back at the house, they tidied up and prepared dinner. That evening, the family regained a bit of hope. Maya would wake up soon, and they could finally begin the process of healing together.

The next day, the last school day of the week, Coco and Mymy attended class as usual. They shared the reassuring news about Maya’s condition with their classmates and Vera, their history teacher. The day passed uneventfully. After school, as planned, the sisters biked to the hospital. Meanwhile, they received a message from their mother, announcing that their grandparents would visit that weekend.

At the hospital, the scene felt sadly repetitive: Maya was still in a deep sleep. The machines continued their steady hum, the only sound breaking the heavy silence of the room. Coco and Mymy sat beside her, each lost in their thoughts.  
After a few minutes, Mymy stood up and announced: “**I’m thirsty; I’m going to the cafeteria for a drink. I’ll be right back.**”  
Coco nodded silently, staying alone with their sister.

She looked at Maya, then gently took her cold hand in hers. After a moment of silence, she murmured:  
“**I know you feel some resentment towards me… but I’ll always love you, even if you think otherwise. I want to treat you like the little sister or brother I never had. I wish so much that you’d accept our help, that you’d talk to us… that we could find a way together to bring you peace.**”

As she lowered her eyes to Maya’s hand, a faint sound escaped the latter’s lips. Surprised, Coco immediately looked up. She saw Maya’s eyes slowly opening. Maya had regained consciousness.

Their gazes met, filled with emotion, and Coco felt a faint squeeze on her hand : Maya was weakly trying to hold it. That gesture, though faint, was full of meaning. Coco felt as though Maya was asking her to help her climb back from the depths where she’d been lost.  
After a few moments, Maya closed her eyes again, but this time to sleep, exhausted from her suicide attempt and the care she had received.

Tears of joy began to stream down Coco’s cheeks. At that precise moment, Mymy returned to the room, a cup in hand.

Noticing her sister’s tears, she grew worried: “**What’s wrong ?**”

Coco, a radiant smile on her face, replied: “**She woke up… and she’s asking us for help.**”",9,1737223987.0,ongezellig,4,1.0,False

It was good, we talked the entire time, it wasn’t awkward and he seems to have all his ish together which is nice since I’m a very independent and self reliant 28 y/o F. Tonight we are set for date number 2, which we planned after our first date. It’s only been a week and so far in between the first date and tonight, he has asked me to hang out multiple times although we have had our 2nd date set. So far this week he has 1. Told me he can come by my place after work and cook me dinner (we haven’t been to each others places yet obv and I’m not quite there yet) I also didn’t offer for him to come by and cook me a meal here. 2. I spilled a protein shake in my car and he insisted on coming over to clean it even though I said I cleaned it all up. (He lives 4 mins away). 3. Asked me twice to go get coffee and breakfast this morning even though we have a date in a few hours. I already told him I had a lot of errands to do today beforehand. 

I know he is being thoughtful, but in my past experience things that are rushed never end well. Also, I’m an Aquarius and i know that’s silly, but we’re rather independent in our nature. I don’t do well with clingy and never have. Does this all seem fine? Do you guys think he’s being a little clingy? I just feel like we’ve only been on 1 date why can’t he be patient enough to wait until the 2nd date? 

My last relationship ended about 6 months ago and was very hot heavy and fast paced so I’m just trying to use what I learned and not do the same thing again. ",1,1737223977.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
