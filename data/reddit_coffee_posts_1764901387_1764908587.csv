As some of you may know im manhattan cafe’s trainer, and as such felt felt it was my responsibility to cheer her up after Agnes Tachyon once again ignored her for Jungle Pocket (count your days Tachyon) so I figured I’d take the coffee loving Uma to a coffee shop. Upon arrival however cafe was displeased to see they didn’t serve an americano (black coffee with creamer,) I told her to try one of their other drinks and cafe, liking sugar cookies, tried their blended sugar cookie mocha. She was also surprised just how much how she liked it, and her mood had improved significantly. it wasn’t until after she drank it that I learned it had 214 grams of sugar and 1240 mg of caffeine!!! Upon learning this information I prayed she would have a bad reaction to the sugar and caffeine, and walked her back to her dorm. It wasn’t until I was violently awoken in my bed by an extremely hyper cafe that I realized just how severe the situation was. She was quite manic, shaking violently and staring down at me with dilated, blood shot eyes, raving that was the love of her life and the way for her to be truly happy was if we *umapyoi*. However I knew it wasn’t what she truly wanted and was just in a caffeine and sugar induced high, and was able to push the intoxicated cafe off me before running for my life!! And while I wouldn’t normally *dream* of outrunning a Uma cafe was a lot slower and less agile due to her stupor. And promptly ran to the boys bathroom in the (haunted) west wing, and barricades the metal door to prevent her from braking in. And thats where i currently am, laying against the locked door waiting for her to give up, fall asleep, or snap out of it. I am lapis lazuli from the Washington Harold, warning you to [NOT] give your Uma a high amount of sugar and caffeine, unless you wanted to be violently *umapyoi’d*",1,1764908395.0,Umaddit,1,1.0,False

1pellw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pellw7/8_months_woot_woot/,8 months woot woot,"8 months today, and kicked off my first sober (work) industry holiday party circuit. Big ole invitation-only party this evening. 👀 no problem though, because I usually just grab a NA drink and network the event with NA beer/cocktail in hand. 

Slight curveball tonight: no solid NA options when I got to the bar. DANG, a bit disappointing. I was ever so slightly tempted by the open bar’s drink menu, and everyone imbibing with fun drinks. But, I ignored that little voice right quick, and, Diet Coke and decaf coffee for the evening it was. Had a good night, chatted with friends, met some folks, enjoyed the live music, and called it after a few hours. And yknow what? I know I won’t wake up tomorrow going “wait, what did I say again to that big important person whose professional opinion of me matters…?” Nope nope nope, I get to walk away sober and composed.

Now at home and treating myself to some ice cream because …… 8 whole friggin months, damnit! IWNDWYT ",1,1764908367.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

It's a 3BHK duplex on the 2nd and 3rd floor (no lift). The room displayed in the pics is available. It is on the lower floor so most of the time you will the entire floor and the lower floor balcony to yourself, lots of space and privacy. We also have sole access to the terrace. It's located within Telecom Layout (HBR Layout 5th block). 5 mins to ORR, 15 mins to Manyata Tech Park. 

We have been living here on and off for the last month, waiting for all the setup to be completed. Cost details are in the description. Setup cost includes:

- 400L fridge + stabiliser (loads of space for all of us) 
- 12L Air fryer 
- 11 months of 300mbps unlimited wifi + wifi ups 
- LG 8kg top load Washing machine 
- 4 burner elica stove 
- Misc. Household items like clothes drying stand, dish drying rack, scrubs, mop etc. 
- Plants
- 6 seater dining table
- Kettle 
- Firestick 
+ Coffee machine, Projector, Toaster, some utensils and cookware which are free to use 

These pictures were taken just before we got all the stuff. We are yet to buy living room furniture and a microwave but that should not add more than 5-8k to the overall setup cost. 

We get cauvery water, there is a solar heater installed by landlord for hot water + geyser for overcast days. 

The bathroom within the room doesn't have a shower but the bathroom adjacent to the room has a shower. Both bathrooms are yours and will not be used by anyone else. You can hang up a curtain or something to block off the entrance (in picture 7) to the outside bathroom and your room to make it fully like an ensuite with 2 bathrooms. 

I work as a data scientist and the other roommate is a production manager for a premium toy company. We are both very friendly, chill, easy going and helpful guys. We are looking for someone who we can be friends with, not just roommates. 

We have no restrictions w.r.t habits and we are secluded enough from the neighbours as well. We both are non vegetarians so when we get a cook that's something to consider. 

Parking available for 2 wheeler.

1pellpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1pellpx/love_my_wife_but_not_my_kid_what_to_do/,Love my wife but not my kid... what to do?,"Stumbled upon this sub so maybe I can find some help here...

Let's start by getting something clear. Before having kids, I enjoyed my life so much with my wife. We got married, bought a nice home and settled down at a town we both loved. We poured a lot of love into it - traveled out of state to buy all furniture, built a movie theater in the basement, set up the bright and cozy sunroom in the back yard where we sat down for coffee in many joyful mornings. We traveled the world and had so much incredible memories for several years.

Then she wanted to have kids...

I objected it at first. But she was able to convince me. Now by no means I'm blaming her - it was my own decision to agree eventually and I am ultimately responsible for what I did. But this might have played into why I now have no love to my kids... who knows.

And then my world was just never the same again.

She wanted and made us move to another town just for better schools.

She managed to convince her parents and my parents to come help with childcare from time to time.

She started building her life around the kid instead of us.

Fast forward to present. My son is now in 3rd grade. He's doing good at schoolwork and getting good scores. He likes basketball. He's competing in a local swimming team. He's just like any normal kid in the town.

I have done the best I could in these years in caring for him. From changing diapers, sending him to pre-school and other activities, going through his homework, personally coaching sports, going on cruise trips, etc. My wife would say a lot of things like, I will grow affectionate over time by spending more time with him, I will change when I get older, I will learn to accept my role when I see neighbors/friends with their kids. Now none of these has happened... yet. I'm at a loss, kind of.

Why did I still do all these things then? Because I love my wife, and she wants me to do these as a dad. But I truly do not feel any joy in parenting. She would be so happy about his trophies, achievements, growths... me - not a single bit. I do not feel proud at all. I hate myself for saying this, but my son could disappear tomorrow and I'd feel nothing, maybe a little relieved even.

What makes it worse? My wife seems to be 100% focused on her son to a point that I feel like I'm no longer being loved. I feel like I'm only here to contribute my time and physical efforts to this family. I'm the driver, the fixer when something breaks, the grocery guy, the tutor, the vacation trip planner... I do not emotionally belong. 90% of time she talks to me would be something about the kid, and maybe 10% about house errands. Close to 0% about anything between us. She'd spend so much time and energy that every time I wanted to talk she'd be like ""I'm too tired, maybe another time?""

Does she really not love me anymore? I can't say. She's still nice to me most of the time. But if I have to choose between her and my kid, I would choose her in a heartbeat. I'm 90% sure she would do the opposite. She'd have most fun spending time with kids, and second would be watching TV or talking to her girlfriends who have similar age kids. I'm the last one on her list.

I have not said this to anyone, so all people around us think I'm a good husband and father. The teachers at school think I'm doing a lot for the kids. Our friends even ask me about how to teach/coach kids. God knows I have imagined many time my life where I move out to live alone in an apartment. I will miss my wife probably, but I'll get to do things I like without having to endure living with my kids. I will be quite a bit happier. Of course I am still willing to fulfill my legal obligations. It was my own mistake making the decision to agree to have kids and I should own it up like an adult. But should I do it and get at least part of my life back to myself, before its too late?",3,1764908350.0,regretfulparents,0,1.0,False

1pell95,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pell95/lovely_boy/,Lovely boy,"
I have spent an unbelievable amount of time in different relationships. Most lasted very little time, with a couple lasting longer than just a small amount of time. A lot of them have hurt, and before I met you? I was thinking about just giving up on dating as a whole for a year or two. Legitimately feared that love wasn’t going to be good for me. 

Then we met at that damned coffee shop.


You were so awkward, and I found it to be cute. You looked at me like I was fascinating, and you never once seemed to mind that I never looked you in the eye. We walked, and you showed me around town, and it was breathtaking. Maybe it was the colors of fall dancing around me that made me feel warm inside. Maybe it was your laugh and how you smiled at my dumb questions about lizards or zombies. 

One date became two, and two became three, and suddenly I was meeting your parents and waking up every morning in your hoodie. Suddenly, I felt so at home when I rested my head on your chest and heard your heart racing. Suddenly, I could look you in the eye, and I have never fallen more in love with a color in my entire life. 

You told me you liked my bluntness, my strange facial expressions, and even my issue with constantly eating pirogies every single night for very long periods of time. You made me feel like I wasn’t weird and unlovable. You made me feel like I was actually worth the love you were offering me.

You cheer me on when I have therapy, buy me books you hear me mention, bring blankets when I absentmindedly joke about the cold, and keep every gift I give you on your desk. You hold me close on rainy days and kiss my forehead, and you call me silly and beautiful. 

I want you to be my forever. I want to hear your stories about work and that doctor you don’t like, I want to tell you about my weird adventures at the grocery store that seemingly always end in a friend of mine going on some weird side quest across the street. I want to be in your life, and I want you to always be in mine.

I love you. I don’t know how else to say it. I really, really love you.

1pelkwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1pelkwp/first_date_question/,First date question,"I went out with a guy last night for coffee. It went fine, quick (45 minutes). It wasn’t like the best date ever, but I honestly hate coffee dates, so if he asked for a follow up different kind of date I would be open to it. We had a good conversation, we’re aligned on a lot and in the same place in life in a lot of ways, but it got kind of silent for a minute, he looked at his phone and said “just checking time, I have to be up early tomorrow.” So, I was like we can go. He said we should do this again over dinner where we are not rushing so I said yea for sure. As we said goodbye I said thanks again for coming out and he said yea it was great meeting, get home safe. And we left. Whenever a guy pays for something for me I always like to send a follow-up thank you, whether I am interested or not. So about an hour after I got home I just sent a text saying  “thanks again for the coffee and for coming out tonight!” He didn’t respond until this AM. He starts work at 5 but texted about 7 (he knows I get to the train at that time) and said “Good morning sorry I passed out last night and no problem.” Wasn’t sure if that’s something I should respond to or not - there was no question or follow up convo from him but also wasn’t sure if ignoring would make him think I’m not interested? So after some advice I just hearted the response and that was it. Haven’t heard from him since. But he hasn’t unmatched me either. I’m guessing he’s not interested but any other points of view from the men out there?",1,1764908281.0,datingoverforty,1,1.0,False
1pelits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pelits/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_monster/,AITA for calling my boyfriend a monster?,"Kinda long post so bear with me. My bf actually made a post about this situation last night but left out some details so now you folks get ALL the details.

I (29f) have been with my boyfriend (30m) for almost 2 years, friends for 2 years before that.

Context: He has a terrible habit of not cleaning up after himself. I didn’t notice it when we were just friends, When we started dating I noticed he goes to bed without grabbing his plate and will just leave it there overnight. I noticed at his house a bag of McDonald’s that still had food in it was left out for over 3 days and only when I said something did he clean it up.

I talked to him about it and asked him if his mom cleaned up after him growing up, he assured me it was a habit he picked up traveling for work. After continuing to notice it I talked to his mom, who admitted she did clean up after him since he started working young due to his dad not being around.

I told him I don’t live like that, I keep things clean. And I expect him to do the same. I’m not his mother and won’t clean up after a man regularly. We both work trade jobs, 10-12 hour days. I don’t expect the house to be immaculate. I can handle clutter, clean laundry hanging out for a few days before it gets folded, mail piling up a bit, etc. But food/dirty dishes are a hard no. I grew up in a trashed home thanks to my drug addict mother, I keep my home clean now.I shouldn’t have even needed to explain that but after multiple times of him leaving out food/dishes in my house I kinda lost it.

He wanted us to live together, and I did too but I told him I wouldn’t do that until he could show me he would get into better habits. Every time I felt like he was doing better he’d slip up again. After I can’t even count how many times he kept leaving messes, I told him I wasn’t sure if our relationship was going to work. He asked me to be patient with him since he’s trying to build a better routine. He and I came up with some ideas. He set a timer to go off every night so he can go around the house and make sure he didn’t leave anything out. It got better for long enough that I genuinely thought it was a long term change.

We moved in together, I voiced my concern about him getting comfortable and slacking again. He reassured me but actions speak louder than words and exactly what I feared would happen did. I started to build resentment and turn into this nagging girlfriend.. we had a huge talk, almost broke up. Once again he made promises to do better, and for a while he did. He asked me to be kinder when he slips up, and i have been working on that. But every time i think things have changed he falls back to old habits. it’s like a switch goes off and he “forgets” everything. It’s been tense, he says I have no patience, honestly I think I’ve run out. Every time I see an open bag of chips from the night before on the coffee table I want to scream. Lately we’ve both been walking on eggs shells, last night it came to a head.

Finally the issue: He said he’d do dishes yesterday, I worked an 11 hour shift, he was off work. He had just had two days off too. He texted me while I was at work saying he’d do them after dinner, and I kinda figured they wouldn’t get done but I was too tired to say anything. We finished eating, watched an episode of our show, then I got on my phone to scroll a bit, I noticed he did too. I thought about reminding him of the dishes, but I am so tired of reminding him to do things he’s committed to. When he got up I was in the kitchen switching laundry and I saw him pause at the sink. He obviously forgot about them but I saw him start them. I told him it was late to not worry about it that I’d just do them the next day. I was a bit frustrated since I was literally laying down for bed and the kitchen is right outside my room so the sound would keep me awake but when I mentioned that he shut me down pretty quickly saying he said he’d do them so he’s doing them. (Yeah I could have helped, but after an 11 hour day work day and him saying he literally watched anime all day I was over it.)

I went to the living room to grab something off the coffee table and I saw PIE CRUST FROM TWO DAYS PRIOR on the coffee table. I hadn’t noticed it since I’ve been so busy but I remembered when he ate the pie and knew it had been there two days. I took a deep breath and kept my promise to stay calm when discussing an issue. Came into the kitchen with the pie crust in hand and said “this has been on the coffee table since you ate that pie the other day.. come on..” I was more sad than angry. He immediately got attitude, I got frustrated. Told him I don’t want to live with mice/roaches/ants (which I’ve said so many times I’m sick of hearing myself say it).

He was holding a glass cup and it broke in his hand, he didn’t seem angry or scary, we just kind of starred at each other for a second before I asked “did you just break that out of anger?” He said no that he was just fidgeting with it and it broke it was an accident. I asked if his hand was ok, he said “it’s fine just a small cut” and started to clean the glass off the floor. I started helping, grabbed a bag and some of the bigger pieces while he grabbed a broom. I asked him again if his hand was ok and offered to take care of the mess, he said it was fine he’d take care of it.

I asked him if he could duct tape the bag when he was done in order to protect animals that might dig into the trash, he said he would. When I heard him open the door I came over and saw he didn’t tape the bag. I said “baby you didn’t tape it, I can do it let me find the tape.” He then got angry, saying he didn’t understand why I cared so much, that it’s going in the dumpster so how can it hurt animals.  I got into graphic detail about what can happen to animals that live in dumps. He looked me dead in my eyes and said “I don’t give a f*ck about any animals that aren’t ours.”

I was shook that he said that. Then I asked him if he purposely didn’t tape the bag.  He said “the tape wouldn’t have helped much anyways.” I said “so you lied to my face when you told me you’d do it? Did you have any intention of doing it?” He said he lied, that he had said he would to get me to “stop”.

Not gonna lie, I raised my voice. I was so hurt by 1.) that he lied to me, and 2.) his comment about animals that aren’t ours. I told him I needed space that I was going to bed cause I had to work early the next day.. he just kept going.

This is where I may be TA: I told him if I told my sister or my friends about this they would ask me why I’m dating such a monster. I felt bad immediately and I could tell it hurt his feelings. The convo was over, he left to sleep on the couch and I cried before finally falling asleep. We both worked today and now he’s grabbing a few beers with his buddies. He normally asks me if he can go out and I always tell him he doesn’t have to ask just to let me know but he always asks anyways but today he didn’t he just told me he was going out. We were both short over text today.

He acts like I’m this high maintenance nagging girlfriend.. I’m really not.. or at least I didn’t used to be. I’ve never had this issue in my past relationships. I’m just so tired of begging him to clean up after himself. And that comment about the animals left a horrible taste in my mouth. ",0,1764908099.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

I worked hard and got my supply up and we were able to drop the formula. 

Now she’s 14 weeks and we’ve just had a visit from the maternal child health nurse and she’s fallen off the chart for weight gain :(

I feel so selfish and stupid. I’ve been drinking coke, alcohol, coffee, taking endone for my chronic pain, all things I knew could tank my supply but everything seemed fine and I just want to enjoy my life again. 
She’s a really chill baby so it took her a while to let us know. All her symptoms this week have been teething symptoms and a midwife even had a feel in her mouth and said she felt a tooth. I feel stupid for believing it could be that this early. 

So grateful that I have the additional support of a maternal child health nurse that has been keeping an extra eye on us otherwise it would have gone totally unnoticed. 

I was already feeling depressed this week and this has really pushed me over the edge. The nurse offered me a stay in the mother baby unit so I can take a break from all my external pressures and just focus on bringing up my supply but I don’t really think I need it.

1pelfic,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pelfic/the_only_woman_i_ever_opened_myself_up_to_has/,"The only woman I ever opened myself up to has ghosted me, and I don’t see myself dating ever again","I’m a 30M and up until this year I had been on a grand total of 2 dates in my lifetime. Never been kissed, no sex, etc. Then this year I met a woman on Reddit through IM, and we eventually got talking on the phone. I found out she lived in an area my friend and I had planned to visit for travel (basically across the US). I arrived a day before my friend so I could spend it with this woman. We had fun and she slept with me. She did everything for me in bed. We cuddled, kissed, played with each other’s hair, licked and sucked each other everywhere, etc. It was lovely. Beforehand I told her about my lack of experience and she said she enjoyed giving me a lot of firsts. 

The next morning I walked around my rental apartment naked with her and felt so confident. Before I visited her, she was working on knitting me a sweater. During the rest of the week she would occasionally bring me coffee and one day she gave me a small container of Vaseline to help with a skin issue I was having. She gave me a massage one day to help with my back pain. She was awesome. 

Then after I came home things fizzled hard. She told me I made her feel cherished and she had such a great time. I know she recently got divorced and they hadn’t had sex in years, so maybe I was just a rebound for her and she just wanted to feel loved again. Idk. She has a lot going on in her life but she went from being extremely excited to talk to me to sending two words answers 3 days after leaving me on read. Now I’m on read for good and don’t plan on contacting her again. 

Either way I just feel disappointed. It took me a LONG time to have this experience, and I can’t imagine getting that lucky again. She seems like a good match for me and maybe it’s just the wrong time and obviously a lot to ask for with the distance between us. I’m still thankful for the experience. 

TLDR; met a woman long distance. Met her IRL and had the best week of my life. Things fizzled out. Feel sad because she’s the only person who ever made me feel lovable, and I’m not sure I’ll experience that again. Whoever gets the sweater is lucky, she’s a very talented knitter.

1pelckq,https://i.redd.it/gwznnus36b5g1.jpeg,Modern COMPLETED Shojo/Josei manga 15+ volumes long,"With Yona of the Dawn coming to an end this month and holiday breaks approaching, I started thinking about what long-running MODERN Shojo/Josei series have also completed. I’m defining “modern” to mean started publishing 2015 or later (to account for authors taking hiatuses and the fact that these are all completed series). I chose to define long-running as 15 or more volumes, but honestly most manga series are lucky to make it to the 6+ volume mark or are intentionally short. 

I just felt like highlighting some of the longer Modern series that have completed. Obviously there are several series that are currently ongoing that have hit the 15+ volume mark, but those are for another discussion.

Interestingly, only 9 out of the total 25 long-running completed modern series on this list are licensed in English (and an additional 1 has no license but does have an anime). Those include:

Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin (only anime officially in English)

Queen’s quality

The king’s beast

A condition called love

Our fake marriage

Cardcaptor Sakura: clear card

Sacrificial Princess and the king of beasts

Something’s wrong with us

Starting at 40

Boss bride days

Complicated POS and software in general

Greetings from the quiet heights of **Dhanaulti**.

There is something profoundly spiritual about a vacation shave, especially when surrounded by the silence of the mountains. I arrived here with four days of growth a rugged souvenir from the city and an eagerness for a tranquil morning ritual.

**The Mountain Ensemble:**

* **Brush:** The trusty **Rubab Men Synthetic**
* **Soap:** The classic **Speick Shave Stick** (First outing!)
* **Razor:** The precision instrument: **Aylsworth Apex Pro Plus**
* **Blade:** **Silvermax**
* **Post:** The silent **Alum** & the legendary healer, **Boroline**

**The Experience:**

The ritual began not with warm steam, but with a shock to the system. A splash of pure, icy **mountain water**. It was electric a jolt that bypassed the coffee and went straight to the nervous system, waking up every pore and sharpening my focus.

This was my maiden voyage with the **Speick Stick**. There is an art to the stick, a rhythm of rubbing the soap against the grain of the beard. The Rubab brush, being synthetic, doesn't hold water like a natural knot, so it became a delicate dance of hydration adding water drop by drop, coaxing the soap.

And then... alchemy. The lather exploded. Rich, slick, and carrying that distinct, spicy herbal scent that feels right at home amongst the pines.

**The Shave:**

The **Aylsworth Apex Pro Plus** paired with the **Silvermax** is, quite simply, a match made in heaven. Despite the four days of tough growth, the razor didn't tug; it glided. It was efficient, silent, and deadly precise.

Three passes later, the transformation was complete. I reached for the Alum block the mountain's judge and was met with absolute silence. Zero feedback. A flawless execution in the thin mountain air.

I finished with a generous layer of **Boroline**, the ultimate shield against the cold wind, sealing in the calm.

A truly tranquil shave to start the day. The mountains are calling, and I am ready.

Happy shaves from the hills!",5,1764907161.0,Wetshavers_India,2,1.0,False

We only have 6 people, and we work solo for most of our shifts, if you come in for swing you have someone with you until 5 but after that you’re there until 10:30 alone which, is actually pretty nice. We have a log that we sign off on daily to make sure our tasks get done correctly and to let the next person know what exactly we got done. Basic stuff.. new mop water, new sanitizer, clean bathroom, ice etc. For whatever reason, it was absolutely slamming yesterday, I mean people were out the door waiting to come in, I re stocked my coolers at least 10 times within 30 mins, had to refill ice 4 separate time, clean the parking lot and clear the trash 3 times. It was so bad that I literally hadn’t taken my last 10 since 8:30.. had gotten there at 6:30 and it was 1:30 at that time. Next person comes in at 2:30 so I was basically rushing to get everything looking as good as I possibly could. I couldn’t get cigs or do the bathroom which I TOLD her when she came in, and I told her everything I did and DIDNT do. She told me not to worry about it and she’d get to it. She almost seemed like she didn’t believe me but, when she got there the parking lot was full and I still had 7 people in line before I could even think about clocking out and leaving. I even clocked out and stayed a few mins extra to do a few more things that I thought were top priority. When I say this girl doesn’t do anything, I mean it.. she’s been talked to multiple times, has had our SM come and literally watch her to see what she does, our assistant even wrote out a list of things she needed done and NOTHING was touched. We’ve even watched cameras on her shift to see what she does and she literally just sits there for hours on end, I mean I get it.. it’s overnight but, literally nothing? No cleaning, not double checking dates, no sweeping, mopping. So to my surprise when I came in, I checked our log from before and she lists EVERYTHING I TOLD HER I didn’t get done like??? “Spill under coffee station, bathroom FILTHY and not done, cigs not stocked” so needless to say I was annoyed as hell. It’s the fact that she knew how busy it was, our lift screen LITERALLY tells you how busy it was and I even beat the days sales goal by myself, projected 2000 and I did 2500 😭hate the fact that I let it get to me but damn dude, it’s annoying as fuck when I put my all into it and people like that still feel the need to make comments.

1pel71h,https://i.redd.it/qxnhbhtw6b5g1.png,"Say Hello to Slo-Mo, The Patron Saint of the Pause Button","**Attention, Fellow Minimalists of Motion!**

We interrupt your regularly scheduled contemplation of absolutely nothing to introduce the face that runs this place (albeit slowly): **Slo-Mo**, the Sloth.

He is not just a mascot; he is a philosophical statement. A spirit guide. He is the physical manifestation of our entire operating manual: **If it can wait, it probably should.**

# Slo-Mo's Credentials (or lack thereof):

* **Occupation:** Professional Hangout Enthusiast. (Does he work? No. Does he even *want* to? Unlikely.)
* **Hobbies:** Mastering the art of the 23-hour nap. Considering ordering a takeaway. Contemplating moving an arm. (The contemplation alone usually takes an hour.)
* **Motto:** ""Why rush perfection when you can perfect the pause?""
* **His Greatest Feat:** Once finished a crossword puzzle... three weeks after he started it. He insists the waiting time was essential for ""maximum cognitive decompression.""

# Why Slo-Mo?

Because every great institution needs a figurehead who accurately reflects its performance metrics. Slo-Mo is a constant, gentle reminder that success isn't about the speed of the climb; it's about finding the most comfortable branch and staying there until something truly essential (like the coffee machine) needs your attention.

He is the reason we replaced the motivation posters with comfy cushions. He is the quiet, fuzzy revolution.

So, next time you feel a pointless surge of energy—a terrifying impulse to *start* something—look to Slo-Mo. Take a breath. Take another. Maybe have a lie-down.

I'm the guy that will leave a store if the music is so loud that I can't hear myself think, or if it's too annoying. I have been in situations where I wanted to run and make whatever was blaring stop just like he did.  
  
Hiring that sort of musician that is so loud and abrasive that he naturally demands every bit of attention rather than adding musical ambience to the environment is also just so..... STUPID from a store owner's point of view, and especially as a coffee shop owner. In the real world, you will absolutely drive people away that don't want to deal with that if it's during their routine visit. One of my managers at the pizza place I work at is a declining, middle aged washed up drunk and every single day for the past 5 years he has been playing the ""Octane"" channel on SiriusXM in the dining room, which is nu-metal, metalcore and all this other shit that is so horrifically inappropriate for a family friendly, small-town dining room, especially during lunch. We have lost so many customers, who are usually senior citizens in the daytime. My own mother even stopped coming in. (It's also because he can't keep the buffet stocked up and he's always creeping on customers and bothering them while they're trying to eat.) It is so embarrassing to be out there and hear The Black Dhalia Murder being played overhead (on top of that it just sucks and nobody at work wants to hear it) He always says ""Nobody ever says anything!"" and multiple people, including me have retorted ""You're right. They just don't come back.""  
  
Also, I really just hated the owner's demeanor. The way she takes Niles cup and gives him the ""shoo"" gesture would be enough to never make me go back again. All because they said ""Damn. You're really gonna pay somebody to completely alter the mood and tone of your cafe?"" all because she thinks he's great. I could be remembering incorrectly, but I don't even remember them taking a real attitude up with her.

I will say though, everybody joining in and clapping is funny because we've had like, one or two people over the past few years tell my manager ""I think the music's great!"" and he gets all pompous and going ""Hey! Hear that? Told ya people love it!"" which is exactly the tone I got from the owner. Hilarious, but infuriating lol. ",22,1764906757.0,Frasier,9,0.92,False

What can I do to make the most enjoyable cup for folks who are all casual coffee drinkers?

A couple notes: I don’t drink coffee everyday, but when I do I usually brew a single cup of immersion coffee, from various roasters and brands. So I don’t have a favorite brew zeroed in. 

I didn’t own a large coffee brewing machine previously but just purchased the OXO 8 cup with thermal carafe and the Moccamaster KBGV. I plan to return one of them, but haven’t decided which. 

I have access to a second thermal carafe, so I liked the idea of being able to brew and hold a couple pots of coffee, around dessert time and one for the road. 

My current grinder is the Bodum Bistro Burr grinder. It’s a fairly old model, I have no issues with it but I’d be willing to purchase a better grinder if it will provide a noticeably tastier cup for the guests. I am unlikely to use a larger grinder for most of the year and had intended my next grinder to be a manual, maybe a Timemore, but I don’t think I can excuse myself from hosting duties long enough to manually grind all those beans.  So I’m willing to purchase a large grinder if the difference will be noticeably better than my Bodum Bistro Burr grinder.

Edit: Forgot to say. I have selected a local roast I’m planning on using and I’m pretty happy with it. So that’s covered. Though I am considering seeking out a decaf as well. ",2,1764906452.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

I’ve stopped cooking because I know she’ll complain about me making a mess. She nitpicks every little thing, like asking why I put my keys on the kitchen table or some other nonsense.

Today we got into an argument, and she told me I look ugly without makeup and that every guy I talk to has “dropped my ass.” And no guy is ever going to settle down with me because I’m a mess. It’s gotten to the point where her constant nagging is making me depressed. I’ve stopped feeling happy and content doing the things I enjoy. Even spending money and shopping doesn’t make me happy anymore; she’s sucking the life out of me.

She constantly makes me feel guilty about the stupidest things. The other day she told me what a bad person I am because I didn’t buy her a coffee, and when she asked to have some of mine and I said no, she went on about how I have no empathy. Like, can I just enjoy my coffee?

My anxiety has gotten so bad because of her constant yelling and controlling. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong, and I’m starting to show symptoms of OCD myself. She’s also so quick to cry and play the victim, claiming she sacrificed her whole life for me, which is complete bullshit.

But here’s the dirty truth: Those glossy gel coats and aggressive filing left my natural nails brittle, peeling, and painful to touch. I’d cringe every time I had to soak them off, watching my once-healthy nails turn into thin, fragile shells. And don’t even get me started on the waste—disposable plastic tips, toxic glues, and chemical-laden polishes that ended up in landfills before the month was out. It felt like I was choosing between feeling put-together and respecting my body (and the planet).

Then came the lightbulb moment. Over coffee with my best friend—who was dealing with the same nail damage and salon burnout—we vented: *Why does beauty have to be so wasteful? So damaging?* That day, we decided to stop settling. We dove into research, testing eco-friendly materials and natural adhesives late into the nights. We refused to cut corners: No harsh chemicals, no single-use plastics, no compromising on durability. After hundreds of iterations, we hit gold: Press-on nails made from 100% recycled materials—tough enough to last through busy workdays and weekend adventures—paired with a game-changing glue derived from rice and corn. No fumes, no irritation, no damage to your natural nails.

Amelia’s Glow was born from a simple belief: Beauty should set you free—not tie you down. Free from expensive salon bills, free from damaging your nails, free from contributing to waste, and free to switch up your style whenever the mood strikes. Our sets are designed to be reused 30+ times (yes, *30+*—we’ve tested it!), so you can rock a sleek neutral for the office, a sparkly glam for date night, and a bold pop of color for brunch—all without tossing anything in the trash.

We’re not just selling press-on nails; we’re building a movement. A movement where “self-care” doesn’t mean sacrificing your health, and “fashion” doesn’t mean harming the planet. Every set of Amelia’s Glow nails keeps plastic out of landfills, skips the toxic chemicals, and lets you own your style on your terms. No appointments, no commitment, no guilt—just effortless, sustainable beauty that works with your life.

Whether you’re a busy professional tired of salon runaround, a eco-conscious shopper looking to reduce your footprint, or someone who just loves switching up their look without the damage—this one’s for you. Join us in redefining what beauty can be: Kind to your nails, kind to the planet, and unapologetically free.

1pekolb,https://v.redd.it/v3srjhb82b5g1,Lepin brickbank 10251 review,"
Lepin 15001 “Brick Bank” – quick review for anyone considering the clone of Lego 10251. Overall: really fun modular on a budget, but you have to accept typical clone compromises. 

Build & design  
The build mirrors the original Brick Bank closely: 32×32 corner modular, bank + laundromat, detailed façade and a surprisingly packed interior. The vault, teller area and the money‑laundering laundromat with chimney break‑in route give it great story and play value, on par with other top modulars. 

Brick quality  
Clutch is generally solid and the building feels sturdy once finished.  Expect the usual clone quirks: slightly warped baseplate that flattens under the build and clear parts that can be scratched or a bit cloudy. 

The exterior mixes white “stone” with sand‑green windows, arches, columns, balcony and clock details, giving it the feel of an old downtown bank instead of a generic office box.
 Inside the ground floor you get a tiled grand hall with an ornate floor pattern, high arched windows and a chandelier under a skylight, a teller counter with security glass and alarm details, a proper round‑door vault with safety deposit boxes, and a side laundromat with washing machines and a front window.

Upstairs there are two offices: a smaller secretary’s room with desk, typewriter, fireplace and coffee setup, and a manager’s office with a bigger desk, lamp, stamps and storage, plus wall art for a more “established institution” vibe. The roof has access doors and a large skylight over the atrium, and the set integrates a hidden robber route through the roof and chimney into the vault, which adds a clever play/story angle without breaking the clean modular look.


Prints and minifigs  
All decorations are printed, no stickers, which sounds great until you see the quality: the prints as grainy or slightly misaligned, especially portraits and clocks.  Minifigures inconsistent . But overall it is an enjoyable experience.

Story
One of the customers disguised as a female customer can be seen on the entrance, she changes the outfit and enters via the chimney. he is helped by the bank manager in entering the chimney. It ends directly inside the vault after opening a ventilation shaft.

1pekm50,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pekm50,What do you think of my secret Santa gift?,"So we coworkers are going out tomorrow to dinner. We filled out secret Santa surveys. The one I chose wrote
Favorite color:pink
Scent: floral
Restaurant: dunkin
And preferences: lotion and giftcards

She uses lotion all the time throughout the day. I decided to play it safe and went with Japanese cherry blossom Lotion(it smells really good). I also got her frosted cranberry foam soap.  She uses hand sanitizer spray all day every day so I picked out winter candy apple because it was the only one that smelled the most like floral.  I also added a candy cane chapstick to be cute. 
I didn't just want to throw in the gift card so I thought to get a clear dunkin ice coffee cup to put in pink fuzzy socks at the bottom then the dunkin gift card ($10). 

I believe the budget was 
$25. 

I'm so nervous because outside of work I'm more anti social due to my bad anxiety.  

I deal with passed trauma. I used to go out with friends, be close to my friends,  be confident but humble. it all changed with my ex. I went through serious abuse both physical and mental.  I was isolated, lost all my friends,  literally brutally tortured and brainwashed to believe that no one actually likes me. And what is there to like? I'm very kind, but i do think,  ""oh they won't like me"". 

At work I feel the most comfortable. I'm confident in my skills.  I'm outgoing at work,  but if I run into my coworker I was just laughing with cracking jokes at work I'm very anxious. 

I'm making myself go because ik it would be good for me. I'm so nervous I didn't get enough or it's bleh.

1pekj6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1pekj6f/godslayer_21_interlude/,Godslayer - 21: Interlude,"Freya sat on the floor just outside of the cockpit, a tablet in her hands and her eyes intently focused on it. She’d more or less completely taken over the common area in the past hour or so, and Jean watched her with a quiet fascination as she made herself some coffee.

   “Tetra, run a diagnostic,” Freya said. “Check your outgoing signals. Confirm anything Vasilios related is offline.”

   ***“Confirmed,”*** Tetra replied. ***“All Vasilios tags are offline. But let’s not kid ourselves they’re going to track my ID and unfortunately, I can’t change that.”***

   “Yes, but we can work with that,” She said. “Can you check for superluminal paths with minimal traffic?”

   ***“What do I look like? A fucking amateur? I’m already doing that.”***  
  “Just making sure.”

Jean took a slow sip of her coffee.

   “That drone of yours has an attitude,” She noted. 

   ***“Hey, fuck you lady!”*** Tetra said. 

   “Sorry, not trying to be insulting,” Jean assured her. “Just saying, it’s unusual. They don’t usually have that much personality. You set her up yourself or what?”

   “Found her,” Freya said. “I was living on a station at the time, working with one of the local scrap shops. We used to trade scrap with a couple of the small colonies around us. She was in one of those shops. She was in good enough working order and she wasn’t coded to any of the Corporations so I fixed her up. She’s been with me ever since. The personality was already part of her when we met.”

   “Unregistered drone, huh?” Jean asked. “Interesting… Android origin perhaps?” 

   “I’ve considered the possibility,” Freya replied. 

   ***“Where I came from is my own business,”*** Tetra said. ***“Stop talking like I’m not here. I’m literally piloting the ship!”***

   “I’m not trying to be rude,” Jean assured her. “I have a lot of respect for the Androids and their tech. Their drones especially. The Corporations are too chickenshit to give them much power. The Androids though? Self replicating AI, weapons systems. They know what they're doing. I used one on my ship, and let me tell you, Android drones are a work of art!”

   ***“Damn right I am!”*** Tetra said.

Jean cracked a knowing smirk.

   “Androids in general are impressive. The Corporations made them as disposable soldiers, and when they decided they didn’t like that, they took a stand. Hell, they actually knocked the Corporations onto their asses for a minute. They earned their freedom and then they fucked off. Claimed some stations and colonies, seized control of their own destiny. It’s admirable.”

   “Is that why you work with them?” Freya asked.

   “Part of the reason. Mostly, I just like them more than I like people,” Jean said. “Androids are straightforward. They want money to send home. I provide it in exchange for their services. The relationship stays fully transactional. Things get messier with people… I lost my patience with that kind of thing a long time ago.”

   “I wouldn’t have pegged you as the asocial type,” Freya said.

   “I’m good at faking it,” Jean replied. “I need to be. I suppose I don’t *hate* it… but given the state of the Galaxy and the things I’ve seen, it’s hard to hold a high opinion of my fellow man.”

Freya didn’t respond to that. She stood up and moved to the table where her droneblade lay partially disassembled. With Tetra taken care of, her next job was to repair it. 

   “You’re oddly social right now, then,” Freya said.

   “Well as of right now we’re stuck together on our way from the frying pan and into the fire, as it were,” Jean said. “I figure I should know who I’m throwing my lot in with.”

She watched as Freya began to work on the blade.

   “You can adjust the sensitivity settings on the blade by feeding extra power to the receiver, by the way. Makes it more responsive. What are you using as a tether, by the way? I noticed you control it with your hand, but I didn’t see any obvious source?”

Freya looked up at her.

   “It’s mapped to my Tac Band,” she said.

   “That’s functional, but you’d get a better range of control with something worn on your hand. I personally go for rings, myself.” 

   “You know a lot about droneblades?” Freya asked.

   “I know a lot about most weapons. Droneblades are good for a personal defense solution… or assassinations, I suppose. Not so much for soldiers. Too hard to master and if it goes down, you’re unarmed. Fantastic as a surprise or a distraction, though. The erratic movement can keep an enemy off guard, especially if you’re using more than one.”

   “More than one?” Freya raised an eyebrow. “That’d be hard to control, wouldn’t it?”  

   “It takes practice, but it’s do-able.” Jean replied. She reached into her pocket and took out two small metal rings. Gingerly she slipped them onto her index and middle fingers. She flexed her hand, then gestured upwards. 

Two small plasma cutters rose from the inside of her jacket. Her fingers splayed and they both ignited, each one showcasing a foot long blade of pure energy that glowed white hot.

   “Plasma cutters…” Freya murmured. “That’s risky.”

   “Very risky. But they’re easy to hide on your person, and with the rings, you can exert a lot more control over them.”

With a lazy wave of her hand, the plasma cutters circled around Freya, the blades remaining pointed at her. 

   “This particular modification is a favorite of mine. Ideal for multiple blades. You get total control, and the rings can be adjusted to set the plasma cutters into both offensive and defensive configurations.”

She splayed her fingers, showcasing the rotating center portion of her rings, then clenched her fist, shutting both of the plasma cutters down although the handles remained levitating for a moment. Using her thumb, Jean rotated the center portion of her rings. The emitters on her plasma cutter drones changed as she adjusted them. They narrowed, while a set of ports on the side opened up.

   “Assault mode. Fires a concentrated beam. Good for range and damage, but you’ve got a short cooldown time afterwards.”

She adjusted the rings again. The ports closed. The emitter changed again to take a flatter shape.

   “Shield mode. Puts up a barrier. The plasma burns hot enough that most conventional ballistics won’t get through. Not foolproof. But very useful in a scrap.” She reset the rings, plucked her plasma cutters from the air and returned them to her coat. 

   “It’s impressive,” Freya admitted.

   “Hey, if you’re gonna sell weapons. You need to know how to handle them,” Jean said. “It’s a messy galaxy out there… but I imagine I’m preaching to the choir, aren’t I?”

Freya didn’t respond, so Jean kept talking. 

   “You’re a Colony survivor, aren’t you? You can always tell. You can see it in the eyes… that thousand yard stare of someone who’s seen the absolute worst humanity has to show.”

Freya remained silent, although she stopped working for a moment.

   “Sorry… not trying to touch a nerve,” Jean said. “The same thing happened to me too.”

   “It’s fine…” Freya replied. “It’s just the way things are these days.”

   “Yeah,” Jean sighed. “It really is.”

After a moment, Freya continued working.

   “So… you lost your family too, huh?”

   “A long time ago…” Jean said.  “It was before my colony got nuked. Our colony had a rough go of it. There was an outbreak. Cholera. We lost a lot of people. By the time the Gold Sun Corporation came in, I was living with a few other kids who’d lost their families as well. We were basically just squatting in an abandoned house. Some of them were too young to really fend for themselves, so the older kids like me did what we could for them. I spent just about every day making the rounds around our settlement, playing up the sob story to whoever I could get to listen. I was quite the grifter, actually. A lot of people did genuinely try to help… and the ones who didn’t ended up helping anyway, even if they wouldn’t realize it until later.” She chuckled humorlessly to herself. “I’ll admit, it wasn’t always above board and I got caught enough times that people started watching their wallets around me. But it kept us fed… at least until the corporations came. I’m sure you know how that went.”

Freya nodded. A vivid memory of a distant flash of light and the smell of burning drifted through her mind.

   “I was away from the settlement at the time. I took odd jobs every once in a while. Courier work, bringing things from one settlement to the next. There was good money in it. When they hit, I was miles away. Still, I rushed back the moment I saw the flash. I didn’t know what an anti-organic charge did back then… but since the buildings were all intact, I thought that maybe…”

She trailed off, then exhaled.

   “Well… you know how it is.”

Freya’s head moved slightly, almost as if she were trying to nod.

   “I imagine you went through something similar, huh?” Jean asked.

   “More or less,” Freya replied tonelessly. “My Mother knew what was coming as soon as she saw the ship. My family ran a scrap shop at the time. We’d salvaged an old escape pod a while back. It was intact enough. It kept me alive…”

Jean nodded. 

   “So you were right in the middle of it, huh?” She asked. “How old were you?”

   “Nine,”

Again she nodded.

   “Hell of a thing to go through at that age…” She said, “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy but it’s an all too common story these days. Most people don’t make it out. How’d you pull it off?”

A memory flashed through her mind. Mint scented breath. The sensation of hands on her body. A voice echoed in her ears.

   *“Come on, sweetie… you do me a little favor, maybe I’ll split the gold with you. I’ve seen the way you work. I’ll bet you’re good with your hands, huh, Bunny?”*

She closed her eyes, forcing herself not to think about it.

   “I put a pickaxe in the back of my supervisor's head,” Freya said. “I told him there was a gold vein down in one of the mineshafts… and while his back was turned…”

Jean laughed. There was a bit more life in it this time. 

   “Oh man… wish I had the stomach for that sort of thing back then. I was always better at talking than doing, though. The supervisor at the factory they put me in was a real creep. He liked to let his little head do all the thinking… most of them do, honestly. He’d pay some of the girls in credits for a little bit of ‘overtime’ at the office.”

Freya gave a shallow nod, feeling her skin crawl at Jean’s description. It sounded all too familiar.

  “I may or may not have convinced him that I had evidence and was ready to pass it along to the next rung up the ladder,” She continued. “I didn’t have jack shit, but he *thought* I did, which was more than enough. So I cleaned him out, stole his ship and never looked back. Granted, the money I got off of him only took me so far. When that started running out, I started making friends in low places. Eventually that turned into smuggling… which was always sort of a mess. Then when I realized guns are a bit lower risk, I started making my name there, and *that* is my entire life's story. Please clap.”

A ghost of a smile tugged at the corner of Freya’s mouth. It was a little forced.

   “So at which point did you meet Victor?” She asked.

   “Hmm? Oh, that. It’s really not much of a story. De Vries hired me to move some equipment to their installation on Valentina B1. It wasn’t the most interesting job and I can’t say that Dr. Lupin and I got particularly close at that point in time… but when everything went to shit, I got a front row seat. I was on delivery at the time. I didn’t see much at first. They’d just finished unloading my ship when the alarms went off and a whole bunch of personnel went running for the hangar. Lupin ended up on my ship… other than that, I really don’t have much to add to his retelling of events.”

Freya nodded.

   “So you saw what he saw, then?” She asked. “The Voidwalkers, the bombs, the mist…?”

   “All of it,” Jean said.

   “So why don’t you have any faith in the Gods?” 

Jean paused.

   “Well… it’s like Victor said,” She replied. “Even he didn’t know if that thing was just passing through or if the Voidwalkers drew it. Personally, I think it was a territorial display. This Universe? It’s their territory. The Sorrow was dealing with something it viewed as a threat. It probably didn’t even notice we were there.”

   “Like an animal.” Freya said.

   “Exactly. You wanna know where I stand on the Gods? I’m with you and Ryder. *Fuck ‘em*. They’re either big, stupid animals who aren’t as divine as some people want to believe or worse, they really are Gods and they abandoned us. I mean look at the state of this fucking Galaxy! Hundreds of billions of lives… living for what? The opportunity to slave away for credits? Clinging to the illusion of freedom while constantly waiting for the day one of the Corporations steamrolls over them, just because you were in the way?” Jean scoffed. “I suppose I don’t hate them… not the way Ryder did, or the way you seem to. But I get it.”

   “I’m not so sure about the animal thing anymore,” Freya admitted. “The Great Bird? That I could’ve just dismissed as an animal. But Shaal…” she trailed off, unsure how to articulate just what she wanted to say.

   “I wanted to believe it was just an animal. I don’t think I can.”

   “So you think they are divine… which I’d argue just makes their negligence worse,” Jean said.

   “I guess… although I suppose right now we have bigger problems than them, don’t we?”

   “I suppose we do,” Jean agreed, “Although I can’t help but wonder… let’s say we put a stop to it. Pull the plug on whatever the Chairwoman is up to. What exactly are we saving? The people? Can we really consider them saved? The Corporations aren’t going anywhere. Even Vasilios is a lot bigger than just the Chairwoman. What do we actually change? What do we fix? Where do we go? We save the Galaxy and… then what? Things continue on the same path. The Corporations continue to wander the cosmos, continue to mindlessly consume. Maybe they eventually start consuming each other? Maybe eventually, it’s just one big corporation, bursting at the seams until it too eventually comes apart, reducing humanity to a bunch of scattered, unsupported colonies, lost and dying amongst the stars…”

Freya looked over at her. 

   “That’s a grim perspective,” She noted. 

   “Well, maybe I just don’t have the highest opinion of people,” Jean admitted. “But look me in the eye, and tell me I’m wrong.”

Freya was silent again. She hesitated before changing the subject.

   “Why don’t we just focus on not dying?” Freya asked. “Don’t worry about the Galaxy and just worry about ourselves.”

Jean laughed at that. A knowing smile crossed her lips.

   “Fair enough,” she said. “Fair enough…”

\*\*\*

Cedar sat on the floor beside Willow’s cryo tube, keeping her silent sister company as much of the rest of the ship rested. Noah didn’t say anything to her… he wasn’t sure what he could say. He’d never really lost anyone before, and even while they’d done all they could to keep Willow *technically* alive, he couldn’t help but wonder if Jean was right, and they really were just prolonging her suffering. He kept a respectful distance and headed to the other side of the shuttle bay, to where he’d set up a small makeshift armory. It wasn’t much, but it was functional. 

He started by cleaning his rifle. It was a simple, almost comforting thing. Something he knew he could do well. Something to keep him focused… something to keep his mind off of the current situation. Maybe it kept him too focused.

   “You got any shotgun shells in this setup?”

Luna’s voice made him jump and he spun around. She stood behind him, her hair still wet from a recent shower. Without the harlequin makeup, she almost looked unrecognizable. 

   “Um, yeah… a few,” Noah said, opening up a drawer and taking out a box. “Take whatever you need. I’ve got a shotgun too, if you want to trade up.”

   “Nah. The one I’ve got suits me just fine,” Luna said, picking up the box. She inspected it, before looking over at Noah.

   “Hell of a setup you’ve got here,” She noted.

   “Oh, um… thanks? It’s not much but I thought it would be useful to have everything laid out nicely.”

   “It’s a good idea,” Luna agreed. “I don’t know if you got a chance to see the setup we had back at the compound… it was a fucking mess. I kept trying to get it organized but I just never had the time.”

   “Well, I guess you guys were busy,” Noah said. “Speaking of the compound, did you manage to get in touch with Pragaras?”

Luna nodded.

   “Yeah. They’re holding up down there. Not too sure about the long term situation right now, but they’ll manage.”

   “I’m glad. They seemed like decent people… um, at least the ones I met did,” Noah said. He paused for a moment before asking the real question on his mind. “How are you holding up? Y’know… after…”

   “Ryder?” Luna asked. “You don’t have to tiptoe around it. He knew what he was getting into, so did I. We both knew that going to the Tower could’ve been a one way trip. I just…” She sighed. “I don’t know. Dunno what to think, what to feel… dunno if I could’ve done anything different.”

She shook her head.

   “I guess a part of me wishes I’d tried harder to talk Ryder out of it. But I don’t know if he’d really have listened.”

   “I mean… at least he didn’t die for nothing, right?” Noah offered. “He took Haraldsen down with him!”

Luna grimaced, and Noah went silent, terrified he’d said the wrong thing.

   “That wasn’t a trade worth making,” she finally said. “Although I suppose there wasn’t any way around it, was there? There was never gonna be any chance of making peace with Haraldsen. We would’ve had to deal with him sooner or later. I’m not sure if he actually believed the shit he said or if deep down, he was just another power hungry piece of shit. Or… maybe I just don’t know if I want to believe a person could really be that evil. I suppose the end result is the same either way. He was the man he was. And people like that… they have a way of poisoning others. As you sow, so shall you reap. Haraldsen acted out of hate… and that same hate grew inside of Ryder. It grew inside of me too… but with Ryder…”

Luna trailed off, struggling to find the right words.

   “Haraldsen poisoned him. He was *angry*. So was I, but with Ryder, it was all he could think about. He didn’t just hate Haraldsen. He hated the Disciples of the Hive in their entirety. I always hoped that once the Priest was dealt with, he’d find some peace… but to be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure.”

   “You were afraid he’d end up like Haraldsen?” Noah asked.

   “I suppose I was. I wouldn’t have let that happen, but… there were a few times where the thought crossed my mind,” she admitted. “Well, it’s not like it matters now. What’s done is done. All that’s left is to grieve and move on.”

Noah nodded.

   “Yeah. If nothing else, you guys at least did something, though. You made a difference! That’s more than I did!”

Luna raised an eyebrow.

   “What do you mean?”

   “Back at the Tower… I barely did anything. When Allard came at me, I led him into the tunnels, but I wasn’t able to take him down. I couldn’t help Mason. Couldn’t stop Freya. Couldn’t do anything about Wagner. I just held my rifle and let everyone else do all the work…”

   “You did what you could,” Luna said. “We would’ve had a harder time without you.”

   “But that’s just it! I *didn’t* do what I could!” Noah said, looking up at her. “I should’ve done more! I could’ve helped more! I didn’t.” 

He sighed.

   “I don’t think I’m cut out for this kind of thing… I thought I could make it. But I just don’t know if I’ve got it in me.”

   “Not everyone does,” Luna said. “You do what you can, that’s what matters. You ever considered a change of career?”

   “All the time,” Noah said with a humorless laugh. “But I hate to say it, the credits are too good. Since we’re putting our lives at risk for the corporation, soldiers' families get some pretty solid compensation and my Mom needs the money.”

   “Is she why you joined up?” Luna asked.

   “Yeah. She’s… she’s had a rough go of it. The Colony I grew up in mostly does mining. Mom hated the idea of going down into the mines though, so she used to work as an ‘*entertainer*’… I… um, don’t suppose I need to tell you what that means, right?”

   “I think I get the gist,” Luna said.

   “I figure it goes without saying that I never knew my father…” Noah continued. “So it was just me and Mom. I… I just wanted to help out. Make sure she wouldn’t need to work like that again. The soldier gig was the best way to do that. Hopefully by now, she’s saved up enough credits so she should be okay for a while… I… I don’t think she’d be the one getting in trouble after that stunt Victor pulled, right?”

Luna didn’t know how to respond to that. Noah set his rifle down on the table.

   “Sorry, I should keep that kind of stuff to myself,” He said sheepishly. 

   “It’s fine. It’s sweet that you care so much about her,” Luna said. 

   “Thanks… I just… I hope she’s alright.”

   “I’m sure she is,” Luna said. “And I know you’ll see her again when this is all over.”

   “If we live through it,” Noah said with a dry laugh. 

   “We will,” Luna assured him. “And trust me, before this is over… whatever you’re looking to prove to yourself, I’m sure you’ll get your chance.”

   “You think so?” Noah asked skeptically.

   “I’ve got a pretty good feeling,” she replied. She took two more packs of shells from his drawer. “Thanks for the ammo.”

She gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder before turning to leave.

Cassandra sat quietly in her cabin, staring down at a book although not really reading it. She couldn’t focus. Couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened on Pragaras.

When she heard a knock at her door, she didn’t respond. The visitor opened it anyway.

   “Hey… just checking in. You alright?” Mason asked, his voice soft, almost comforting.

   “No…” She said tonelessly, barely looking up from her book as Mason sat down beside her. 

   “Yeah. I kinda figured. I noticed you disappeared right after the briefing.” 

   “I just… I needed a moment,” she replied. 

   “Fair enough…” he said, although there was something about his tone that implied he knew more. 

Cassandra didn’t say anything. She just kept her silence, until Mason spoke again.

   “You did your best, Cassandra.”

   “Don’t patronize me,” She said, finally putting the book down. “Don’t.”

   “I’m not!”

   “You are! ‘*You did your best.’* Well that’s not good enough! Two of the Gods are dead, Mason. They’re dead and I couldn’t stop it! Nothing I did was enough, I’m… I’m just not capable… I want to be! But I…”

Her breathing was getting heavier now. The tears she’d been holding back finally came, flowing down her cheeks as a sob escaped her. Mason put his arms around her, hugging her close.

   “It’s alright…” He said.

   *“It’s not!* I… I don’t know what to do, Mason… I thought I could do this but I’m in over my head…*”*

   “Maybe. But you convinced me,” he said. “I didn’t want to believe it at the time, and I’m sorry I brushed you off back then. But after I left, I started thinking and I realized that if there was even a chance you were right, then I couldn’t just sit by and do nothing. Everything I did at the Tower, I did because of you.”

Cassandra didn’t reply, although her sobs had gotten quieter.

   “I know the situation isn’t great right now. But look at the positives? We’re trying to set things right now. We can still fix this! There’s still two Gods left, and even Freya seems to agree that we need to be protecting them. You did that.”

   “It feels like it’s too little, too late…” Cassandra said softly.

   “I know. And it’s easy to beat yourself up over what you think you could’ve done better. But you have to look at what you *did* do. Don’t think about what could’ve happened. Think about what *did* happen.”

   “You make it sound so easy…” She said.

   “It’s not…” He admitted. “But it’s all we can do.”

Both of them were silent for a moment.

   “Do you think *she* would’ve done it better?” Cassandra asked softly. Mason looked down at her. 

   “I don’t know,” he admitted. “For all I know, *she* wouldn’t have done it at all. Don’t think about that. Don’t think about her. You’re not her.”

Cassandra’s body tensed up, and Mason quickly corrected himself.

   “I don’t mean that as an insult… I mean… she was a lot more like Mom and Dad. You’re not, and that’s not a bad thing, it’s…” He trailed off and sighed, struggling to find the right words. 

   “It’s fine… I guess I could never be her, huh?” Cassandra asked. “It’s hard not to compare myself, though. I can’t help it.”

Mason nodded in solemn understanding.

   “Yeah… I guess that’s fair,” he said. “Look. You may not be *Her*, but you're still my sister and no matter how things turn out, I’m with you until the end here. No matter what.”

Cassandra looked up at him again.

   “You mean that?” She asked, even though she already knew the answer.

   “I mean it,” He promised and offered her a hand. “Come on, I was going to try and make something for Cedar. She’s been down in the shuttle bay with Willow ever since the briefing, so she missed dinner. Do you want to meet her?”

   “I’d like that…” Cassandra said, taking his hand. “I’d like that a lot.”

Mason guided her to her feet and led her out of the cabin, leaving her books behind.

Victor entered the cockpit quietly, a candy bar sticking out of his mouth and another in his hand for VI. She took it, but set it by the dash, without paying it much attention.

   “How are we doing?” He asked. 

   “We’re taking a bit of a weird route. Avoiding other ships to avoid Tetra needing to communicate with them. No communication, no logs for Vasilios to track. Supposedly it should keep them off our back for a while… supposedly.”

   “Well fortunately for us, Skye is an idiot so that might work in our favor. Although unfortunately, he’s surrounded by non-idiots, so that gives us a 50/50 chance.”

Vi nodded and Victor watched her from the corner of his eye.

   “Everything okay?” He asked.

   “No,” Vi replied. “I heard what Cassandra said… about the Voidwalkers. So the Chairwoman is really bringing more in, huh?”

Victor gave a low hum in response, thoughtfully chewing on his candy bar. 

   “It seems so,” He said. 

   “It’s going to be like Valentina all over again…”

Victor nodded. The gesture was solemn, contemplative. 

   “We’ll make do,” he said. “If all goes well, we’ll have a God on our side. That should mitigate the damage, and if worst comes to worst, we have you and Freya.”

Vi’s eyes shifted over to him. 

   “I don’t want it to come to that,” she said. “Especially not in front of the others.”

   “I know you don’t, love. I don’t either. But we have to be realistic. If push comes to shove, we’ll need to consider all of our options.”

   “They’ll hate me,” Vi said. “I don’t want that.”

   “Nonsense. They won’t hate you.”

   “You say that with such certainty… I’m not so sure.”

   “I am,” Victor said. “No matter what, you are still my daughter and as my daughter, no matter what, I will always be by your side. If they can’t accept you, then they can find a different pilot on a different ship.”

Vi almost laughed at that. Almost.

   “That wasn’t a joke,” Victor said. “I’ve got your back.”

He put his hand over hers and gave it a gentle squeeze. He felt Vi’s skin shift… writhe beneath his hand, as if her entire being was shuddering. It subsided quickly and he watched her give a slow, meaningful nod.

   “Thank you, Papa… thank you.”

   “You are my heart, Violetta,” Victor said. “You may not be my blood, but I love you more than I have ever loved anyone else. Believe that. Believe it.”

  “I love you too, Papa…” Vi said. He felt her shifting again… it took her longer to stop this time. Longer to compose herself, but he gave her that time. He just held her hand, and took the chocolate bar off the dash.

   “Take a break,” he said. “I can drive for a bit,”

She nodded and took the chocolate, relinquishing the controls to him although she didn’t leave the cockpit. For a little while longer, they sat there, just the two of them, Father and Daughter",2,1764905168.0,HeadOfSpectre,1,1.0,False
1pekj5a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pekj5a,MRE Biscuits and Gravy?,"Hi folks!

Gorgeous right!?

What we have here was a wonderful experience brought to me by MKR! Thanks dude!

This is a 2013 US MRE Menu 4, Pork Sausage in Cream Gravy!

Full transparency,  the biscuits were NOT part of the ration; they are 2 frozen Pilsbury buttermilk biscuits split in half.....and they were glorious.

Pic 1 shows the main, the star attraction! Topped with some crushed red pepper and some black pepper, this was a great meal! Look at all that sausage! And it tasted great, with a silky smooth, very flavorful cream gravy. What an experience this was. Can only imagine how great this was when brand new!

Pics 2-4 show packaging and contents. Look at the spread and contents of this meal! Amazing!

Pic 5 shows the wonderful Mountain House granola with blueberries! You simply can't beat this stuff, it's so good even when made with water. This was 12 years old and perfect.

Pic 6 shows the toaster pastry. This was a great treat on a 8 mile hike I did! Had a wonderful rich and complex flavor. Can't believe this survived fully intact for 12 years.

Pic 7 shows the crackers topped with 12 year old cheese spread. It was a little ripe but fully enjoyed 100%. My kiddo even had some.

Pic 8 shows the coffee with the sugar and non-dairy creamer. Perfectly fine!

This was not only a great main, but quite frankly, a very well put together ration. You could take that cheese spread and mix it into that cream gravy, crush up those crackers and add them in, and you would have an amazing meal on your hands. Top it off with the coffee and granola a bit later...forget about it!

Big thanks to MKR for allowing me the opportunity to try this one! Get it if you can folks!

Take care!",16,1764905165.0,MRE,3,1.0,False
1pekikg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1pekikg/the_small_decisions_that_change_your_life/,The Small Decisions That Change Your Life,"In the journey of life, we often focus on the big milestones—graduating from school, starting a new job, or moving to a new city. However, it's the small decisions we make every day that can have the most profound impact on our lives. These seemingly minor choices accumulate over time, shaping our habits, perspectives, and ultimately, our destiny. Recognizing the power of these small decisions can open the door to a more fulfilling life.

https://preview.redd.it/hdda7ce01b5g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54eef2b2c42aae850dfd2406b0edf888f62cce4c



The Power of Daily Choices



What we choose to do each day can set the tone for our lives. Every morning, we face a myriad of choices: from what to eat for breakfast to how we will interact with others. Each choice adds up and influences our mood, energy levels, and overall mindset. By consciously making positive choices, we can cultivate a more fruitful and optimistic outlook on life.



One of the simplest yet most impactful choices is how we greet the day. Starting with a positive intention can create a ripple effect throughout our daily activities. Whether it’s setting aside time for gratitude, meditation, or even just taking a moment to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee, these small rituals can transform our mental state and prepare us for the challenges ahead.



Embracing Change in Routine



Another crucial area where small decisions can make a difference is in our daily routines. It’s easy to fall into predictable patterns that become monotonous. However, breaking out of these routines, even just a little, can invigorate our lives. Choosing to take a different route to work, exploring a new hobby, or even trying out a new recipe can introduce fresh experiences that rejuvenate our spirit.



Assessing our routines allows us to identify areas for improvement. Are we spending too much time on social media? Are we neglecting our physical health? These transitory moments can lead us to embrace healthier habits and foster personal growth.



Cultivating Positive Relationships



Interactions with others can significantly affect our well-being. The decisions we make regarding how we treat our friends, family, and colleagues can lead to more profound connections. Choosing to offer kindness, lend an ear, or express appreciation creates an environment of positivity. These small, intentional acts can enhance our relationships and build a community where everyone feels valued.



Furthermore, we also have the power to choose the relationships that enrich our lives. Surrounding ourselves with supportive, like-minded individuals encourages personal growth and keeps us motivated. Conversely, distancing ourselves from negativity can free up emotional space for fulfilling connections. Every small decision regarding whom to spend our time with shapes our emotional landscape.



Nurturing Self-Growth



Investing in personal development is a powerful small decision that can lead to monumental changes. Whether it’s dedicating just a few minutes each day to read, learn a new skill, or reflect on one’s challenges, these choices can pave the way to success. Carving out time for self-improvement injects purpose into our lives and highlights our potential.



Setting small, achievable goals can further catalyze growth. Instead of overwhelming ourselves with ambitious objectives, focusing on manageable steps allows us to progress steadily. Celebrating these small victories reinforces our commitment to continuous improvement, boosting our confidence and motivation.



Practicing Mindfulness



Mindfulness is another small decision that can profoundly alter our experience of life. Taking a moment to breathe deeply or center ourselves during a hectic day transforms our perspective. By cultivating mindfulness, we learn to appreciate the present moment, reducing stress and anxiety. These brief pauses can enhance our mental clarity and allow us to make more conscious decisions.



Making a habit of mindfulness can also shift how we respond to challenges. Instead of reacting impulsively, we can approach situations with a calm and measured mindset, leading to more constructive outcomes. This intentional approach not only impacts our experiences but also enriches our relationships with others.



Starting Small



Importantly, it’s essential to remember that every grand journey begins with a single step. The small decisions we make today can accumulate into significant changes tomorrow. It doesn’t matter how trivial a choice may seem; by taking thoughtful, deliberate action in the present, we lay the groundwork for our future.



In addition, cultivating a mindset of gratitude can amplify the impact of these decisions. Recognizing the value of our small choices fosters a sense of appreciation for our journey. Each step contributes to our growth and happiness.



In conclusion, the small decisions that fill our days hold the potential to shape our lives in remarkable ways. By embracing positive choices, cultivating meaningful relationships, and investing in ourselves, we can create a life filled with purpose and joy. The path to transformation doesn’t always require grand gestures; often, it's the little things that lead us to monumental changes. Start today by making those small yet significant decisions, and watch your life flourish.",1,1764905119.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

The cops came and went carrying the chunk of meat with them. Nothing came of this. I called the local police department almost daily to ask whether they had found him, had a lead, found the victims, hell if they were even looking in the first place. They came up with nothing.

It was bizarre he hadn’t taken the car, none of his friends had seen him, and by the end of the month, when I received his bank statement in the mail, I noticed that he had not left the city to begin with. The list was not a full report, only spelled out a couple of transactions at liquor and grocery stores before asking to go the website to see the rest.

I stared at the page of transactions for what must have been an hour, a subtle trembling and nausea that could have either been excitement, or nerves disturbing my body. there was only one clear path forward, I knew that, and I knew what I would find and the end of it, I just wasn’t sure whether I could handle having my knowledge reassured.

I began searching for a private investigator right away. A good one is impressively difficult to find since any dickhead with a subscription to the whitepages and a car can apparently slap the title on himself and charge $50 an hour. But at the same time, they are concerningly just as common as people who will be able to duplicate a phone down to every account, they had ever associated it with.

I didn’t have enough money to even come close to hiring the latter (God knows if I ever will) but after a few hours, I had dug up a passport, and his birth certificate, packed them into a folder with the bank statement and got ready to meet up with the PI that I would be working with.

Steven, the private investigator, planned for us to meet up at a diner, two or so miles from my apartment. The choice of location was weird, I’d thought they would be more professional and call me up to a depressing beige office, but I was not complaining. It felt safer being out in public, even if the only other patrons of the diner were an older couple, maybe in their seventies, speaking so softly to each other, you’d think they had only been together for a year.

I’m not sure of his age, the conversation had not required him to mention it, and I was too uninterested to ask, but Steven was at least old enough to not have a single strand of hair that had not turned gray. He showed up ten minutes after me and five minutes early. We took a stall and got straight to work.

I explained everything I have typed out before, save for some details I’m sure I don’t have to pint out. He listened, intermittently taking sips of coffee and writing down notes on a small notepad. At the end of our conversation, he took the notes, the little amount of help I had brought him and four hundred dollars.

I’ll spare you from much of the verry little that happened over the next few days. But by the end of them, steven had managed to pull Gaige’s bank statements and found out that every Thursday, Gaige would usually pull money out of the same ATM.

I bit the bullet and paid Steven enough to camp out at the ATM, right at the time when Gaige would usually arrive. He was apparently hard to make out, wearing a thick black hoodie and a medical mask over his face, but once Steven confirmed that it was in fact Gaige, he began to follow him. Steven described the path he took as “awkward” Passing through alleyways, and taking long routes around certain areas instead of walking through them, cutting through a playground and jumping a fence to a cemetery that was weirdly right beside it. And at the end of it all, after a walk along a freeway, he arrived at an abandoned motel. Second floor, room number 4T.

I was too far in to give up, and work only paid me so much, so I took some money out of a savings account and paid Steven to intermittently watch the motel for another four days. Gaige only left the room early in the morning on the first and opted to order large bags of groceries for the rest.

There was a debate in my head to pay for more, but past the financial irresponsibility, I realized that it was just me putting of the inevitable, I knew where he was and as much as I had hoped that it was not true, I knew what he was, a killer.

I am aware that it was some pathetic, vigilante suicide mission, that there were better options, options that were safer for me. But I could not trust others with Gaige, he was mine, I knew him best and I needed to see him and talk to him to hear his reasoning. I needed closure to know why he had become this. I pretended nihilism, tricked myself into believing that I knew death would be the only way out of that motel room, but every thought I had and every plan I conjured up in m y head ended in me making it out alive, satisfied with all that transpired within.

It was raining when I got to the motel. I was running on twenty minutes of sleep and a half a gallon of red bull pushing itself down my piss pipes. I snuck a hunting knife into the neck of my right boot and got out of the car, hoping Gaige had not moved over the last day. I climbed up to the 2nd floor balcony and watched the numbers on the doors count down all the way to four.

I stood there for a moment, listening to the hissing rain and knocked. No one answered, just as I expected. “Gaige… it’s me… please let me in… I just want to talk” I knocked again and spoke to the door, just to get more of nothing in return.

I held the copy of the key Steven made for me. I’m doubtful of whether it was legal, or a part of his regular services, but I am sure that it was highly irresponsible of him.

It took me a moment to stabilize my trembling hands, but after a bit of struggle, I was rewarded with the click of an opening deadbolt and a stench that brought bile rising to the back of my throat.

The room stunk of rot, a crushing sweetness that sunk to the base of my gut and an aery, sourness that softly glided down the lining of my nostrils, leaving behind a nettle like trail of stinging aches. Each inhale left a bitter aftertaste on my tongue and a thick coating of bile on my teeth.

I stepped into pure darkness, and slapped my hand onto the wall to my right, looking for a light switch I did not know was there. I think this is where it began, the disassociation. Every decision past this point was either the reward of control that had to be fought for, or pure primal urges.

The switch flicked on an old and overworked yellow lightbulb, illuminating pure carnage. There was more of what I had expected, piles of teeth and bones ranging in size, a sheet of skin pinned to the wall like some form of morbid tapestry. But sadly, there was a lot more of what I hoped not to see, body parts, A lot of them, too many of them, piled wall to wall, sloping from the filthy carpet, all the way to the ceiling. Most dunes of rot were piles of indistinguishable chunks of meat, wet bones still poking out of the pinkish grey. In the mess, I could make out some arms and legs and torn chunks of torsos. Sets of scattered eyeballs and large blankets of skin covered the floor.

Some of the amputated pieces were organized, tossed into empty, plastic salt containers. But by the looks of it, he had given up on organization a while ago, as now, these containers held puddles of grey meat and mold, thick as moss.

I stared for a while, baffled by the sight in front of me, unsure of what to make of it, struggling to see it as anything more than a single conglomerate of flesh, bone and shit. Everything past this point was all filth, no reason behind it, no history, and no future that involved me, it was all just an obstacle that I would allow myself to process once it was something I had fled from. I had to go in deeper, I wanted to, I had to know, I had to see more and since he was nowhere to be seen, the lack of immediate danger drew me in further.

The bed was the worst it got, the mountain of bodily remains was now more of a wall, the flesh at the base crushed flat by the weight above it, entrails flowing in and out, wrapped around protruding bones and limbs. The wall sat nearly all the way up to the wall. I had to shimmy through the gap with my back facing the meat. I felt the warm decomposition soak into my jacket, replacing the cold of the rain. the squeeze through the gap took longer than expected, the crevice turning into a meaty tunnel lowering me down onto the filthy carpet, forcing me to twist my body and go on all fours.

The wet ground squelched under my hands and knees; I opted to not take my eyes off it as if I couldn’t feel it all. I felt limp fingers stroke my back and my shoulder slide across slick, exposed ribs. The end itself was a tight squeeze, Like I had just crawled through the bowels of a beast to emerge from its asshole. The wet meat around me aided in the final push and I easily slithered out into a surprisingly, but not well at all lit room.

There was something about the second half, it felt more hopeless, like I had just gazed into the void. The air was heavy with shame and a deeply brewing, hyper condensed sense of loss. I stood up, exhaling deeply, hoping to heave up the pain that had sunk to the depths of my lungs. Right in front of me, on the wall was a knife, pinning something to the nicotine and blood stained wallpaper.

Ignoring the rest of the room, I stepped in closer, trying to get a better look at what I was looking at. Something as small as this must have been special if it was given the same treatment as the full body sheets of skin.

The pinned meat hung limp, it looked like three separate strands. I only recognized what it was once I leaned in closer and saw that two of them ended with small ovals. It was a uterus.

The realization hit me at the same time as the loud screeching of a baby. It took me a second to gather myself. I crouched down, slid the knife out of my boot, and rushed over to the bathroom door in the back. I slammed the door open, and rushed in.

There were dozens of them, piled up in the sink, some premature, still underdeveloped red and pink jelly like meat wrapped around soft cartilage. The others looked older, with yellow skin that was still lathered in slime.

The screaming was coming from the bathtub; I expected the worst as I slowly shifted my gaze towards it. I expected some kidnaped woman tied down, smeared with blood and shit and forced to give birth.

But I saw Gaige with his hair clumped together by rot, his head tilted back, his yellow teeth gritted in pain. My eyes drifted down his body, to his belly button that was now an opening with the head of a baby poking out.

He grunted, and began to scream as the baby slid out more and more, twisting its body and dilating his hole until it finally, fully slithered out of his gaping vagina. He picked the baby up, weirdly not noticing me, and raised it to his chest.

“shhh… It’s okay now” he whispered to the newborn with a low pitched, bellowing voice.

The baby cried for a bit longer while Gaige grabbed his sagging left breast. I could not believe what I was seeing, I refused to believe what was going to happen would, but the baby latched on, and began drinking Gaige’s milk.

“shhh… it’ll all be fine now” he whispered again and stroked the baby’s cheek, while a sheet of skin peeled off his, and fell to the bottom of the tub with a wet smack.

I must have made some sort of noise at this point, because he quickly shot his vision up at me and stared. He stared at me for minutes on end, the baby still suckling from his teat, and I stared back. There is no doubt that both of us waited for the other to speak. I waited for an explanation and he waited for me to demand one, but neither of us could muster the bravery to speak.

He stared at me with those eyes, the same eyes that had wordlessly spoken messages of love and comfort to me, eyes that held the power to do so again. There was no malice behind them, there was no secrecy, just love, fear and sincerity.

He looked down at the baby when it began to scream again, it screamed so loud that the room shook so loud that I felt waves of sound vibrate against my skin. Soon after, it began to heave dry, and cough wet Flem in an unending cycle. I tried to step in instantly but Gaige raised his arm.

“No! you’ll hurt it more” his voice boomed.

The baby took over a minute to die, I watched in shock as it began to slowly turn purple, Gaige only looked down to it with pity while it shifted colors and flailed hopelessly.

After it fell limp, Gaige raised the umbilical cord to his mouth and ripped it with his teeth, the flesh tore with a wet zip. It all felt like a routine that he had fined down to a point, his eyes drooped, the death had hurt him, I was sure of that, but he opted to go about it in a rather sterile, emotionless manner.

I took a quick step backwards when he finally rose to his feet. He was taller, maybe by a foot or two and he was naked, both his single breast and flaccid penis hung and flailed with his motions in unison.

He looked down at me while he stepped out of the bathtub, his face unsure “I… I don’t know what to tell you… I don’t know what any of this is…” he laid the baby onto the pile “I don’t…” he burst into tears, weeping loudly “I don’t know what I am” he gasped between sobs, the weight of fear pulling tears out of his eyes, and raised his hands to his face, one of them was slender and brown, it’s wrinkled skin clung to his bones “I don’t know what…” his voice repeated, muffled behind his hands.

I lowered the knife, I hadn’t realized that I was still holding it up until then “Gaige, hun…” I stepped forward and reached for his face, gently stroking his cheek “it’s okay… I don’t need an explanation; you don’t owe me one… I saw it all, I know that you’re not a monster”

He looked into my eyes, a glint of hope shining in the corners of his. After all this time, after all these fears, surrounded by death and rot, I saw Gaige again, Gaige, the person, scared and lost, weeping in my arms like he had Hundreds of times before.

Out of nowhere he backed away from me and began to cough. He coughed on, his chest heaving up and down. In the crossfire, his single, sagging breast ripped off his body and spanked onto the ground, splattering a snotty green slime from its jaggedly ripped end. I looked up from the ground to his wound, meeting with the freshly developed flat chest that matched his other breast.

He kept coughing past that though. Kept coughing until a strip of meat slithered out of his throat and hung down between his teeth. I felt guilty watching him but there wasn’t much more that I could do.

He reached up to the meat with his non decomposed arm and coiled the strip around his index finger before pulling slowly. I heard his throat let out a low-pitched squeak as more of the strip left him. Each millimeter of pulled flesh came with a muted reverberating snap of tendons shaking his throat. He pulled it further, coiling more of the bodily tissue around his finger and then, gave one final tug. The strip of flesh and the vocal cord at its and flung out of Gaige’s mouth, he only reacted with a weak cough and tossed it onto the ground.

“is there a way to stop this?” I asked “I’ll do anything… please just tell me we can fix this”

He responded by opening a tub of table salt that sat beside the bathtub, raising it up to his mouth and dumping all its contents down his throat. With his head tilted back, like a snake unhinging its jaw, he struggled to take it all down. So, he turned around, stepped under the shower head, and flipped it on, flushing it all down with the help of suspiciously brown, warm water.

He took a moment, and then, without any subtlety in his speech he said “you have to kill me” his voice, now a higher pitched rasp.

“NO!” I yelled “There has to be another way. There has to---”

“there isn’t! This is it, this is the best it’ll ever be” he shouted back “I’m rotting, inside and out. And I tried to fix it, I tried to give it what it wanted, I fed it. But it’s a bastard, scum, living under my skin. The fucker can’t do shit right”

“what are you talking about?” I asked, baffled by the senseless string of words

“it promised that it’d stop punishing me if I fed it, that it would regenerate all that I lost” his voice had grown more somber now, I listened, my confusion forcing me into silence “when it didn’t stop and when it remade me wrong, I peeled my skin off, I wanted to scrape it’s spunk off of myself. But it had seeped too deep, it’s not just under my skin, or wedged between the fibers of my muscles, the mucus is in my sweat and tears, it’s wrapped around my blood cells, it’s slowly taking over” he took another short brake, wiping the tears from his eyes, one of which incidentally happened to pop out of it’s socket “I need you to kill me” he repeated, pinching his optic nerve with his index and middle finger “please” he yanked the eyeball out of its socket, the thread of meat behind it sliding out with a slurp and another eyeball sliding into its place moments later.

“Gaige, I can’t just kill you” I explained “I can’t just give up so soon and let you go… I just can’t… I need you, I can’t see myself going on without you, knowing what I did to you… it’s just…”

“DO YOU THINK ITS EASY FOR ME!?” he lashed out “I’m losing control, this body isn’t mine anymore. if I could, I would’ve slit my throat weeks ago! And…” I saw him hesitate “And where do you think those babies come from?! I fucked myself, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. it has my body; it’s raped me and any day now it’ll take over my mind too!” I stared at him feeling shame drape over me “the mucus, It wants to be born again, it wants to take a human shape, disguise itself” he took in a deep breath “I can’t do it myself, it won’t let me, so please… kill me”

I broke and clung to him, crying. Wrapped my arms around his unfamiliar body, and pulled him in so hard I was sure we would melt into one.

“But before you do” He leaned away for a moment “I need you… one last time”

He was already leaning in for a kiss when I moved away from his chest, a bridge of gunk arching between us. I took his slips, God, it had been ages since I had felt them, no matter how many times they might have been revised, they felt the same.

We stumbled out of the bathroom, mouths hungry and intertwined, caressing each other. I lowered my lips down to his neck where a small flab of skin peeled off and flew down my throat, it tasted of bitter, long brewing sweat.

While he undressed me, I slid my hand down his chest, it was slick with the mucus and blood. Near the base of his torso, I slid two fingers inside of his new, dilated hole, and felt him shudder in response.

It felt bizarre, getting fucked on top of a piles of decomposing flesh, but it had all felt too familiar to be repulsive, it was all Gaige, ripped and tattered and heaved up, sure, but it was him in the rawest form wrapped all around me, smeared across me.

He stopped at one point to unpin the knife from the wall; the uterus had hung so long it had dried and stayed glued to it. Once he walked back over to me, he handed the blade over, there were no words exchanged, there wasn’t a reason to.

We continued, a growing anxiousness rising as we neared the end. I raised the knife to his throat, its weight held firm, the blade softly biting at his skin, drawing beads of blood.

“I love you” he moaned just before I slashed the knife across his throat. Hot blood came spilling from his esophagus and poured over me. I continued cutting, swinging the knife left and right, the metal gliding through him with a hiss. I kept cutting, the sharp metal only momentarily struggling to get thought bone, until his head and his body dropped down on top of me as separates.

It was a battle to roll him off me, some of his muscles still flinched and his stump was still poring dark crimson in sync with his slowing heartbeat. His body creaked as it twisted and finally gave out, rolling over to my side.

I could not look at him, see what he had become, see what I had done to him. I got to my feet, put my clothes back on, crawled out of the meat tunnel and into the liberating, frigid air outside.

The rain had intensified. The grey puddles that had riddled the cement before were now replaced by a constant ankle high pool. I walked down the stairs, mind distant, still shaking off the orgasmic high. The rain began carrying the filth down my body and legs with spiderwebbed rivers of gore. My skin was a refreshing cold, my lungs happy to breath anything but the brewing stench of shit and rot.

I drove home, rushed up the stairs to my apartment, first hopeful, then thankful that they were deserted. I spent an hour in the shower, pretending that I was disgusted by the grime lathered into the grooves of my skin, while in reality, I was talking myself in circles, trying to force a thought that could process what I had seen and done.

Gaige was the only person I had trusted to know me and to love me. He was the only person I had cared for, and the only person that had cared for me. The first person that helped me fall asleep at night with the promise of making the next morning worth waking up to. And he held that trust, that love and care until the end.

I’m pregnant. I’ve miscarried eight times, only the first was an accident. I feel it growing inside of me. Every night, it gets larger and hotter, waking me up in agonizing pain. as it begins to char my insides, smoke comes pouring out of me. I must feed it until its contempt, and when the fucker decides to slide out of me, I’ll snap its fucking neck.",1,1764904797.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

(Call me naive - see the username - I get it.)

I love babywearing, and it’s definitely the easiest way to get up and down (unavoidable) subway steps… but I don’t want to destroy the baby’s fragile sleep schedule or screw up baby’s hips by confining baby to the carrier for hours and hours on end. Tried dragging my Minu up and down subway stairs today while carrying baby on my front… I’m actually strong and relatively healthy physically (thank goodness!!!) but it was miserable. And then when I got to the street… it’s freezing! I’m not going to do the carrier-to-stroller-to-carrier transfer there!

Should I just bring around the car seat? (Also if I go to sit for a coffee somewhere it’s not like baby’s going to keep quiet while stuck in that thing, which might have happened in the stroller…)

What do others do when they’re trying to go out and about with baby alone? How do you deal with putting them down here and there? I knew my best laid plans were always suspect but the reality is hitting me…

1pekeaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/1pekeaz/have_you_had_a_client_with_a_mental_health_crisis/,Have you had a client with a mental health crisis while you’re working with them?,"I’ve been a full-time professional photographer for about 8 years doing weddings, portraits, and mostly non-commercial work. I say this to point out that I’m working with all sort of people. Individuals, not teams or businesses. 

Because of this I meet all sorts of people at different points in their lives. I’ve gone most of my career not having any issues with clients going through mental health issues but it’s come up a few times recently and I would love for some people to share their experiences and offer me some guidance. 

Last month I had a bride miss half of her elopement shoot because she had a panic attack. Everything turned out fine but it made me think. Then just last night another shoot got much more complicated. 

A woman reached this week out saying that she needed photos for an album cover and needed the shoot to be done quickly. I took the job even though she was a little squirrelly with details about style, inspiration, even describing type of music she makes. It was all rushed. I was a little suspicious but went through with it anyway because my week is totally free and it paid decently. 

She ended up sending her Instagram page and it came across as pretty eccentric but not alarming. 

We did the shoot and it was great. Positive, friendly, good vibes and the photos came out really well. I sent some preview pictures this morning and she liked them but asked if we could meet so she could see more photos and make some selections from the whole catalog. 

BUT THEN tonight she posted some of the photos on Instagram with a cryptic message about how you shouldn’t judge people by outward expressions because the happy girl in the photos attempted to take her own life right after the photos were taken. THEN she posted some front facing IG stories about unsupportive friends and stuff. A lot of ranting about people not handling her emotions well. It all came across as manic, not necessarily depressed. I don’t know this person well enough to know family or friends to reach out to or even an address to send police to for a wellness check, but again, I’m supposed to meet her tomorrow for coffee to look at more pictures. 

What should I do? I feel bad for her, and much further down the line of importance I’m a little concerned about her using my images associated with this type of online expression.

1peka6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingconfidential/comments/1peka6b/how_long_does_it_take_to_feel_settled_after_a/,How long does it take to feel settled after a move? Asking from the “sitting on the floor eating takeout” phase.,"Everyone says moving is exciting. You get a new space, a fresh start, all that jazz.

But nobody tells you about this phase: the sitting-on-the-floor-eating-takeout one, where you’ve technically “moved in,” but emotionally, you’re still hovering somewhere between your old home and a random Airbnb.

It’s been almost three weeks since I moved, and I still can’t find my favorite mug. Every time I reach for it, I open three wrong cabinets like I’m trying to unlock a secret passage. The boxes are mostly gone, the Wi-Fi works, and my mail is showing up (small victories), but I still don’t feel… settled.

Everyone says it takes time, but how much time are we talking? Days? Weeks? Months? Because right now, I feel like I’m just play-acting as a responsible adult who owns furniture.

**The weird timeline of “settling in”**

Nobody warns you how weird the timeline is.

**Week one:** You’re running on adrenaline and caffeine. You unpack the basics, your muscles ache, and every box starts to look the same. You convince yourself you’ll “finish unpacking tomorrow,” which is a bold-faced lie.

**Week two:** You’re surrounded by half-open boxes and guilt. You eat meals off paper plates because the real ones are “in a box somewhere.” You’ve gone through at least two dozen trash bags, one breakdown, and four DoorDash orders you don’t want to talk about.

**Week three:** You start realizing the unpacking isn’t the problem; your brain is. You wake up in the middle of the night and have no idea where you are for three seconds. You still type your old address on forms. You drive halfway to your old grocery store before remembering it’s now 40 minutes away.

And somewhere around there, you start wondering: how long does it take before a new house stops feeling like someone else’s Airbnb?

**The emotional hangover nobody talks about**

I expected moving to be a little tiring, but I didn’t expect the emotional hangover that came with it.

It’s not that I regret moving; I like this new place. But it still feels temporary, like I’m borrowing it until the real owners come home. 

My routines are gone. My “coffee corner” doesn’t exist yet. And even my cat looks at me like, “Dad, why did you change everything?”

You can’t pack comfort or familiarity in a box. You have to rebuild it, one small thing at a time.

The hardest part is the silence. My old place had this familiar rhythm: neighbors’ doors closing, the hum of traffic outside, even the creaky sound my fridge made when it cycled. Here, everything is too quiet. Too new. Too… not mine yet.

I didn’t realize how attached I was to background noise until it disappeared.

**The first night: equal parts thrilling and weird**

The first night is always the strangest. You’re too tired to unpack, too wired to sleep, and everything feels too big and too quiet. I sat on the floor surrounded by boxes, eating cold pizza and trying to remember why I thought moving was a good idea.

It’s that uncanny mix of pride and panic, like, “Look at me starting a new chapter!” and “Who let me be in charge of my own life?”

But here’s the thing: every “first night” feels wrong until it doesn’t. The next one feels a little less empty. The one after that, you start to recognize the shadows and creaks. Before long, the silence that felt uncomfortable starts feeling familiar.

**The identity shift no one prepares you for**

There’s also this weird identity crisis that happens after a move. You don’t just leave behind a home; you leave behind the version of yourself who lived there. The barista who knew your order, the walking route that cleared your head, and the friend who lived five minutes away.

When you move, you lose all those tiny reflections of yourself, and for a while, it’s like you don’t recognize the person in this new setting. It’s uncomfortable, but also kind of freeing, like you get to decide who you are all over again.

**The little things that trick your brain into feeling at home**

Weirdly, it’s the small, random things that make a new place start to feel real.

Like the first time you do laundry here or when your shoes pile up by the door without you arranging them. Or, when you finally hang that one picture that makes the wall stop feeling empty.

I even got a doormat just so my brain would stop thinking “guest mode.” Somehow that $12 Target rug did more for my sense of belonging than all the furniture combined.

It’s those little acts of normalcy that teach your brain, “Hey, we live here now.” It’s like tricking your nervous system into catching up to your zip code.

**Signs you’re starting to settle in**

Slowly, things shift.

You stop checking Google Maps every time you leave the house. 

You know which drawer the forks live in.

It’s funny, you don’t realize you’re settling in until you already have. One day, the takeout boxes are gone. You light a candle, put on music, and start to see your stuff not as “boxes in someone else’s house,” but as a home taking shape around you.

That’s when you know you’re getting there.

**The comparison trap**

Social media makes it worse. You see people post their perfectly decorated apartments like they snapped their fingers and it all appeared. Meanwhile, I’m sitting on a pile of bubble wrap, eating cereal out of a mixing bowl.

But no one posts the messy middle: the exhaustion, the tears, that mysterious IKEA screw that haunts you forever. Feeling settled isn’t instant. It’s messy, gradual, and deeply personal.

If anything, the people who take longer might end up more grounded. Because when you’ve had to earn that sense of comfort, you appreciate it differently.

**What’s helped me so far**

Nothing revolutionary; just small, grounding things:

Putting up one familiar decoration (mine was a photo from my old porch).

Getting out and learning one new local route every few days.

Doing something normal, like a grocery run or cooking a real meal, even if it’s just pasta with canned sauce.

Letting the space stay imperfect for a while.

I used to think settling in was about unpacking fast and “getting organized.” Now I think it’s just learning to live in the in-between until your brain catches up.

**So… how long did it take you?**

That’s what I’m curious about. How long did it take you to feel settled after a move?

Was there a specific moment when your new place started to feel like home, like when you hosted your first dinner, heard rain on the windows, or stopped missing your old space? Or did it just happen quietly over time?

Because right now, I’m sitting on the floor with a carton of noodles, surrounded by things that technically belong to me but still feel like guests in their new house.

I’m telling myself it’s just a phase, and if anyone says it takes six months to feel settled, I’m ordering more takeout.",1,1764904433.0,movingconfidential,0,1.0,False

I go out ready to try, aaaaanndd that’s where it stops. I go to an expo or the mall and then I plague myself with doubt. “Am I bothering.” “I think I’m interrupting.” “They look busy.” I rigidly stare forward or bury myself in my phone; not avoiding eye contact but not going for it either.

I’m not the best looking of guys (I think) and I take blame (overweight with a bitter poker face), but the bigger issue is my vitiligo. Light brown skin with white patches everywhere. By default, people try not to look presumably trying not to look like they’re staring. I’m not exactly approachable, so I’ll do it but, again I don’t know how introduce myself out of the blue at the coffee shop or the library. Full disclosure, I’m not insecure of my skin but I certainly don’t think it helps.

I think I can do it, but I don’t know how to start it.",2,1764904217.0,socialanxiety,2,1.0,False

I’m posting here hoping to find a someone who wants to cuddle and get to eachother over time.

I’d describe myself as an introverted extrovert, I enjoy going out and trying new things, but I also appreciate chill nights in. I love sports, coffee, and movies. I’m a Regal pass and Letterboxd user, so I’ll watch pretty much anything if it interests me. I also enjoy TV shows and some anime. 

I’m hoping to meet someone who also values communication, emotional connection, humor, and getting to know each other and cuddle/hangout. Looking for someone in SoCal/California and around my age. I’m totally open to trading pictures once we both feel comfortable.

If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out 🙂",1,1764904167.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1pek6uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1pek6uw/how_delta_is_and_is_not_premium/,How Delta is and is not “premium”,"In my ~1 week being active on this sub I have noticed an interesting phenomenon: a lot of people complaining about Delta’s premium branding not matching reality, and then those people being heavily downvoted.  So it begs the question, in YOOL 2025, what aspects of the Delta customer experience actually are premium vs the competition, and which fall dismally short.

Gonna provide my take on this, but curious to see the discussion.  Some caveats:

- I am a hub-captive Delta flyer who does 90% of my travel on Delta, although I used UA and AA much more heavily in the past.  If something I say about UA or AA below is no longer accurate, call me out.  Also, 80% of my travel is domestic business travel, 10% domestic personal, and 10% international personal.

- I’m mostly talking major US airlines when I say competition.  I am aware that the U.S. airline industry is a depressing race to the bottom compared to many ex-US airlines, but feel like the main claim Delta makes is that they’re the best in the US (specifically, best of the big three)

So with that…

WHERE DELTA IS (STILL) PREMIUM:
- Economy Class service.  The route I fly most often is ~4 hours long, and when I’m stuck in the back on that route, I appreciate the frequent coffee/water walks bookended by two full drink/snack services.  I feel like UA and AA fall short of that.  Similarly, the last long-haul I did on Delta in coach (~3 years ago) surprised me with perks like multiple warm snacks mid-flight, self-serve (gross) wine, etc.

- IFE. With few exceptions, if I’m on a Delta flight long enough to want to watch IFE, there is going to be IFE in front of me.  I can’t say the same for UA (tho I’ve heard they are making strides in this department), and AA actively shat the bed with Project Oasis.

- Sky Clubs. Sky Club food can and does serve as a meal for me in many cases. I can’t say the same about United Club or Admirals Club food spreads.  The Delta hot food spreads vary in quality, but at least they are a staple of the clubs. 

WHERE DELTA IS DEFINITELY NOT PREMIUM:
- First and Delta One.  I feel like this is one area where Delta is engaging in magical thinking based on some supposed brand equity built up pre-COVID.  Domestic First meal service has been reduced to a single tray of declining quality and declining size.  And when it comes to Delta One, I feel like Delta slapped some doors on a minority of their biz class seats nearly a decade ago, clapped, and never looked back.  I challenge anyone to find real, tangible factors that justify the premium DL charges for D1 relative to their competition.  It simply isn’t there when you remove individual factors like hub presence.

 - Elite Status.  Feel like I’m preaching to the choir here.  Delta is the most pay to play of the Legacy carriers.  In fact, they basically invented Pay to Play when it comes to loyalty program design.  Choice benefits are nice, but I feel like most Diamonds would trade them in a heartbeat for upgrade chances that approached UA or AA levels.  This may soon no longer be a negative differentiator for Delta, but if not, that will be because UA/AA get worse.

- Tech.  Why does it take an act of Congress to determine if your RUC has been applied correctly?",19,1764904153.0,delta,16,0.88,False

1pek4nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1pek4nk/always_omad_yet_gain_weight/,Always OMAD yet gain weight,"Hey, so this is like one of my first times posting on here but I have to ask. So I've had disordered thoughts about my body for a while, maybe like 5 years now. Since I got my period years ago and obviously gained weight, I started eating really weird. one period of time was when some days i started barely eating and then other days I would suddenly eat a lot, and I think it started to mess up my metablism really bad because yknow not eating would slow down my metabolism and when I went back to binging so quickly I gained a lot of weight. I went from 120 before my period, 130 after, to 135, 140. So at that point, I decided I needed to lose weight. For context, im 5'7, but the way my weight is distrubuted, it goes in all the wrong places. I get bloated so easily, im talking I look full on preggo when I bloat. My calves are HUGE, which is my main insecurity. And my chest is also pretty big for my age. So my body, even thouhg I didnt even weigh that much at 130, looked super heavy. So once I became 140 lbs and decided to lose the weight healthy, my disordered eating came back but manifesed itself differently. I started binging more, caring less about what went into my body. I thought if I ate more my metabolism would heal and i'd lose weight, but obvs that didn't work. Then this summer, i went on vacay, and thats where things went super downhill. I started purging. If you know, you know, whern you travel cback home u gain a bunch of weight because of snacks, going out, things like that. And I felt super guilty about it.I didn't wanna give food up, because it gave me comfort at the time since ive fallen into  a big depression recently. I also used to $H in the past, so harming my body with something like purging wasn't new to me. When I got back from vacay, I had gained a lot of weight. I was 157 lbs. Fast forward, I've stopped eating at school, so I mainly eat one meal (my dinner, us arabs dont usually eat 3 meals so im used to breakfast and dinner only), and that meal is always usually somewhat healthy. I have a iced coffee daily if I can, and fruits or little things on the side. Obviously, on weekends I eat more, but the thing is, on the weekdays, i really don't eat that much or enough. Yet somehow I only maintain my weight, and then the second I eat something unhealhty or slightly more than usual, I gain weight, not to mention my bloating and stomach fat is insane, so it looks horrible. How can I heal my gut health in a way that accessible for a girl, because I know this all must have something to do with why i cant lose weight, and is there a reason this is happeneing?

1pek4gv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pek4gv,Kitchen remodel ideas,"I am planning remodeling the kitchen this winter. My wife and I are struggling to pick a color for the cabinets and countertops.

My thoughts are a navy blue for the bottom and white for the top cabinets. And a white quartz countertops with grey streaks. I am also going to take out the tiny bar top on the back of the sink and make it one flat countertop to open up the kitchen. We have dark coffee oak floors everywhere and agreeable grey walls. Eventually we will repaint or redo the trim in white. We feel so limited with colors due to the dark floor.

As of right now I don’t really plan on re organizing the layout but open to ideas. Maybe somehow getting a coffee bar to the right of the fridge or something.

Also toying with the idea of taking the light out and putting something else in but not sure what would look good as that style of light is all over the living room not in the picture.

Sorry if these idea posts are not allowed just really looking for some input to make sure what I am wanting to do want just ruin the kitchen. Also trying to keep it under $5000 as a DIY. open to criticism. Thanks everyone!",1,1764903965.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False

1pek233,https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/1pek233/today_was_day_90_as_vmf_clerk_i_made_it/,"Today was day 90 as VMF Clerk, I made it!","The 90 days is really stressful. Any mistake could be your last, but it can also be held against you till the very end. Technically, I could have been let go after I clocked out today if that's the way the winds were blowing. On my side was the fact that they looked for anyone who could pass the test for over a year. The VMFs in general are short-staffed because the pay is lower than mechanics would get on the street, but those mechanics have to work their way up to great pay, and even then they don't have the benefits or union we have. And USPS pays way more out of the gate.

The VMF Clerk job I was told is a unicorn even inside USPS, that people get it and retire from it. I was a street hire. I had completely forgotten I tool the test and applied. I was looking for municipal jobs when I got the call. Starting pay is not as good as mechanics, which I could also probably do if I took that test (I Passed the 955 and I have been working on our cars for years). The pay for me is like $27 an hour. Which is much better than my last ""real job"" working at Target for $17 an hour. Uber wasn't cutting it any more. I'm not sure if every VMF is the same, but if you hop on the ODL list, overtime desired for people not in USPS, you get 16 hours at our facility. Right now scheduling is done in house, so if you don't feel like doing it one day there's no ding. Other places apparently if you miss 3 days you're off the list for 3 months. Our VMF, New Haven, CT (where Yale is), you work if if and when you want to. So if you start at $27, your OT is like $40.50 an hour. I'm grossing like $1730 a week, more if it's a working holiday because that bumps it up with holiday pay. Do the math. It's not bad pay.

The hours for VMF suck, but not like they do for CCAs or sorting clerks. CCAs can be there 6am and still be there at 6pm. Other clerks have weird split-shifts that would make me hate myself. One good thing about the VMF clerk role is you get hired career. No two year wait like with some of the other crafts. And the benefits are really good. But when you see what comes out of your check you'll know why. 35% gone. lol. But I mean that's free and clear after TSP, FERS, life insurance, which I will have with USPS while it makes sense, medical, dental, vision, etc. After a year in for non-USPS people there is a health care plan that costs either $50 or less a pay period or month, I forget which, but covers the same stuff my BCBS does now, but they ""gift"" you like $2,000 every year so you never hit your deductible in most situations. 

This job is why we were able to afford a new apartment while we house hunt that's 1400 square feet in a brand new building, first tenants, and I got myself a Telluride. 

All that being said, if you have long-term goals other than being a potato, you are not going to want to stop here. If I could, and from what I gather it's next to impossible, I'd switch to one of the remote help desk jobs on the APWU side of things. They also have them under EAS, but if you take the EAS ones you can get laid off pretty easily. The pay for the other is stellar, more than a postmaster, and it's entry-level. But super-competitive on top of everything. Or you could take the 955 like I did and do one of those jobs. I might still look into that. Pretty sure I have to wait a year or so to do it because of the lock thing when you start out. Or if you have mechanical skills you could switch at some point to being a mechanic, or supervisor, or fleet manager. 

The VMF Clerk job is typing, all day. Invoices, mostly. It's boring as all hell. But you get an office if you're lucky or a cool cubicle like I have and you can bring whatever you want, food, drinks, even a microwave and minifridge if you want. And no one is over your shoulder, it's at your own pace. 

Here's how I almost lost the job: 5 am is the start time. I'm still not used to it. I fell asleep a few times. I fixed that error with C4 energy drinks. And coffee, of course. My lunch clocks were wrong a bunch of times, I kept waiting till like 12 and it's supposed to be within 6 hours of when you start. And I left early one day because of a dental abscess, which wound up being LWOP, not AWOL, so it worked out. I also messed up a few invoices, but to be fair we do literally thousands of them so mistakes are going to happen. 

To celebrate my 90 days I took my first vacation day. Tomorrow I get to sleep all day.",6,1764903775.0,USPS,0,1.0,False

I did it because i saw what i thought at the time to be unfixable problems but in hindsight we could have just talked them out. for example we both struggle with depression and other mental health issues and while I'm a person who tries really hard to break out of said depression he takes a lot more coaxing to get back on track. The other main reason i ended it is because i saw a bit too much of my parrents relationship in ours, my mom and i are very similar people and my dad and ex are also in that my mom and i are very set on growing and improving ourselves while they are a lot more reluctant to start the process. Anyway two weeks later I'm the worst I've been in a long time, while i did start going to the gym again I've stopped eating and doing homework. i feel like I'm spiraling and i literally just want to talk to him. I just don't know if I've messed everything up or if i should even try talking to him at all. i was going to text him on Sunday and see if he would want to meet for coffee and talk but idk if that's a bad idea.

All three of us have shared the simple cars for two years now, despite our son's longing for a car. Now the longing becomes a need because another kid will be driving soon, and four people need to get four different places, including college next year. 

Cute the heated discussions. Our son is very obedient, so they're not fights per se, but it's frustrating to come to an agreement on what car is right when I ask for suggestions and I get ""I could get a Volvo V70R, a Ford Taurus SHO, or a BMW 135i."" The choices he makes (esoteric, geriatric, impractical) make my head spin. We once went and looked at a 1979 Fiat X1/9 because he was sure this was ""the car he needed."" The car \*was\* adorable.

Readers, we live in Michigan. He will most likely be going to college in the UPPER peninsula of Michigan. They currently have a few feet of snow. 

Any suggestions welcome from car enthusiasts for anything that would make a teen/hopeful automotive engineer/cars up on blocks in garage happy with as many of these criteria as possible:

1) As safe as the current '15 Tucson or '23 Elantra. Perhaps no older than a 2010 (Puts Saab out of the running).  
2) Appropriate for driving in harsh winter conditions above the 47th parallel. Ground clearance!!  
3) Drinks regular 87 gasoline, not 93.   
4) Cool for car guys. He parks my Elantra in a different parking lot for Cars and Coffee and walks because it's my old person car.     
5) Easier to find than the one V70R right now that fits the bill in Arizona  
6) 15-20k. I kept my college car until my kids went to kindergarten, I'm ok spending a bit more.   
7) He doesn't like Trucks or SUVs, especially crossovers, loves wagons.   
8) No CVT, or oil-thirsty Subarus, per his request.

There was something about the V70R that made it superior to any other Vs or S60 or whatever, I think it was the AWD, but the XCs are not cool. 

Ultimately, he'll drive whatever we get and be OK with it (spouse does not want to give him the Tucson, he likes it just fine), just like he's driven an Elantra and a Tucson for 2 years and been OK, but it would be cool to get parent points before he leaves the nest forever.

1pejq42,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pejq42,Building a brand from scratch,"
Been a while since I posted here. Tried to start a proper, branded account but it’s been tough to get karma, so I’m back with my old account 😬.

I designed this shoe last year. Finished sampling around December or January (‘25), places the bulk order and took delivery in April. Moved everything from my basement to a storage unit. QC’d the pairs, ordered some promo stuff (bandanas, pins, etc.), and officially launched in May. 

Didn’t really have a plan, outside of meta ads - which I’m not great at, so I started hitting events. Pop-ups, makers markets, flea markets, coffee shops, pretty much any place that’d let me sell. Met a bunch of people, practiced selling (I’m extremely introverted), and saw that the people who supported were way more diverse than I initially thought - which has been really cool. Got my first wholesale accounts - small ones, but it’s a start.

The initial bulk order was 250 pairs - 125 of each color. And it took me about 5.5-6 months to sell a little over half of them. That’s been with me hitting 1-2 events per month. The black n white is my favorite, but the wheats have been the best seller. 

Also did some product seeding to some influencers - not huge accounts, but like the 15-30k range. Hired some folks off Fiverr to help with ads - first 2 were duds.

I branched out to more accessories - hats (lots of hats) and a couple small batches of tees. Currently have the next 3 sample models in development as well as a cut-n-sew hat and some new fleece.

Learned more about sampling shoes in a few months than I did with clothes with my first brand a few years ago.

I know a lot of people seem to blow up overnight. That hasn’t happened for me yet, but it’s def been cool/fun to get back to this…I didn’t realize how much I missed it…photography scratched a different creative itch, but not like this.

Working on some videos about what I’ve learned (tech packs, picking manufacturers, how to be more efficient when sampling, factory red flags, quality vs cost tradeoffs when you’re on a budget, etc.). If there’s anything anyone is interested in knowing I’m an open book.

Just felt like sharing. Also, here’s a few pics I took of my bro in his antique shop when I was first getting started.",11,1764902857.0,streetwearstartup,4,1.0,False

I told my son to stick to the hours they promised, but he said everyone else was working longer and he didn’t know how to speak up, so he just kept working too.

The coffee shop isn’t even open yet—they’re opening soon. And today, when my son said he couldn’t come because he had something personal to take care of, the owner got angry at him. I have no idea why the owner is getting mad when they’re not even paying him for the training. Isn’t this basically exploitation?

Kitty-corner from me sat Tom, one of our PMs.  He was listening to his voicemail out loud.   The current message was from someone who was irate he called Tom an asshole and a few other sharp names and was yelling; I could imagine spittle coming out of the corner of his mouth.

I could hear everything clearly from my cube. Tom hung up his voicemail and returned the call.  His first words were ""Who is your manager"".   The person on the other end provided the name and Tom replied, ""Hold on I'm going to conference him in"".  I heard Tom push the buttons and lean back in his chair.

He started out ""Let me Introduce myself I'm Tom LastName and I work for company"".  He continued, hardly pausing for breath: ""The same person that signs my check signs your check"".  ""You called me and raised your voice and left profanities"".  ""I get paid a lot of money to put up with shit from clients, however I should not have to put up with it from fellow employees"".  ""The next time you call me you will be nice.""  ""You will say please and thank you and you will not raise your voice at me"".  ""Have I made myself perfectly clear"".  ""Ya'll have a nice day"".  Then he hung up.

I overheard this call more than 30 years ago and I can still quote it pretty much verbatim.  I think it's a lesson we should all remember as we go about our workday.

In those 3 years, almost everything in my life except my career has taken a back seat.

May free meal/diet plan pa c/o my sibling na registered nutritionist lol

Baby fussy? Somehow it’s also my milk, and not the fact that she’s only 4 weeks old and starting her first big leap/ growth spurt.

Longer wake window than normal? Because I had a cup of coffee and the caffeine is ‘keeping the baby awake’. As if one cup of coffee will do that…

I could go on and on. I truly believe my baby doesn’t have any intolerances or issues with my milk, and of course I would eliminate things from my diet if I thought it affected her.

I try to ignore it but it really bothers me. I’m exclusively pumping because formula is so expensive, and I’m really proud of my milk supply and baby’s growth. It’s been difficult but I’m pushing through.

My mom only used formula for her kids so she doesn’t really understand breastfeeding, and she doesn’t even try to. I try to explain but it goes in one ear and out the other.

She also judges me a lot of using gripe water and gas drops, but I only give them to the baby when she’s extra fussy at night and nothing else helps.

I have PPD so maybe I’m being overly sensitive but it just hurts my feelings sometimes and idk if I should be direct and tell my mom.

I’m using a throwaway account just in case. My bf (23M) and I (23F) have been in a relationship for almost 6 years. Lately, I feel like we have been more disconnected. For context, we are high school sweethearts. We did long distance at first when I went to college but eventually he moved to be with me. He works while I go to school. He works as a line cook and makes just under $2K a month. I am now in vet school and don’t work at all (I used to work a little in undergrad). For chores, I do laundry (laundromat), get groceries (once a week and whenever we need them, oftentimes having to stop by after school), cook 2x a week, do the dishes, and general cleanliness of the kitchen/livingroom/bedroom. He does the bathroom when needed, clears his desk area weekly, takes out the trash, does dishes 2 out of his 3 days off, and will often help tidy up when needed. We live in a small (<500sqft) apartment with a cat (my responsibility). My parents chip in half of rent ($300) as well as paying the utilities and internet ($200 total). My boyfriend pays the other half of rent, buys groceries (~$400/month), and pays for anything else small that we may need.

We’ve had our ups and downs but I love him and really can’t see anyone else being my life partner. Since starting vet school, I feel like our relationship has been strained. I’m sure it’s a mix of things such as a lack of quality time and my own stress. Since starting vet school, the household tasks I do have become harder/more stressful for me. I have OCD and it comes out in an obsessive need for things to be clean when I’m obsessing about school. My bf says to let him know if I need anything done and he’ll do it, but sometimes for me it’s not that easy. I come home after a stressful, long day of studying ready to relax and find a bunch of dishes in the sink and the counters dirty. Now I need to clean them and I’m upset. It’s hard for me to ask him to do it now that I’m there and it needs done. 

Due to all this added stress, we’ve had a lot more arguments lately. Usually started by me because I try to bring something up in a constructive way (how I’m burnt out, heavy mental load, wanting him to be more proactive, etc) but I always say things the wrong way and offense is taken and the conversations just feel shitty. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t want to bring things up because I don’t want to cause an argument, I just want to talk, but I always feel like I start an argument. I think it’s because if I bring something up that would mean he has to change something, he feels like I’m saying he’s not good enough/not doing enough or that I’m trying to change who he is. 

One point that was brought up was that when I start these conversations, I say something that goes against his character, but in day to day I don’t compliment him. It’s something I’m now planning on working on. But I feel like all of this stress and everything has made it hard for us to communicate. Simple texts will become more stressful than they should be and the fun loving energy we used to have is more strained. 

I do believe my boyfriend is depressed and I think he has a reliance on me for his happiness, so I think the less time we spend together affects him more, especially since he moved away from family to be with me. Unfortunately, there’s not much I can do for that, I need to focus on school. Does anyone have advice on how to help support him or have more effective quality time since my time is limited? (Currently I am at school till 7pm generally, sometimes later, but Sundays the whole day is for us)

I also want to get him into counseling and us into couples counseling but he’s very wary of it (mostly the couples counseling because he’s a private person and I think there’s concerns of things being twisted). Does anyone have any advice on how to frame it in a way to show him that it would help our relationship?

The main thing I need advice on is how do we get back to what we were? We used to be great communicators but I feel like now the communication isn’t as easy and walls are being put up. How do we get past this? Has anyone experienced a similar bump in their relationship? 

I feel like the villain when I ask for help/support, which is crazy because he is a supportive bf (he sometimes vacuums or does dishes when he knows I’m stressed and often offers to buy me a coffee to help keep me going). Is it the way I’m framing things? Is it that I’m just being too particular about everything? Does anyone have advice on how to differentiate between what should be brought up and what I’m just overreacting about? 

If there’s anyone that has a different perspective for me to consider that would also be helpful! I’m terrible at considering all sides and would love if someone could help me understand my boyfriend’s perspective better. 

TLDR: me and my bf’s relationship has been more strained since I started vet school. How do we get back to communicating well like before? How can I convince my bf to do couples therapy? Any perspective?",1,1764902032.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1pejaiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenAreNotIntoMen/comments/1pejaiw/yall_need_to_talk_to_women/,Y'all Need to Talk to Women,"Hi.

I am here to help people talk to women. 

Some relevant details about me:

I was - entirely against my will - born with gender dysphoria. It's a biochemical reaction between my brain and my body. It made my body into a chronically, horrifically painful flesh prison for my brain. It was a great time. 10/10 would recommend.

(No one talks about this but it's why gender dysphoria is a chronic neurological pain condition. Only improved with specific medicinal treatment. Hugs, therapists and blueberries do jack shit for this particular brain chemistry. It's hormonal medicine or bust.)

I know that some portion of y'all were born with this condition as well. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

Some more background:

Y'all might not believe this but there are a lot of hot trans women who look exactly like hot cis women. How? HRT, (hormone replacement therapy), REALLY glows a lot of girls up. It's a happy side effect of lessening the chronic pain. That little blue pill really can do a bitch wonders

I am very lucky to be one of the women who got an insane glow up on hrt.

Because of this, I see men looking and staring at me constantly.

It just so happens that as a lesbian, I do not reciprocate this attention. 

How I react doesn't depend on the men's appearance, (because I'm not attracted to any of them), but rather it depends on their body language. Sometimes I find it flattering. Other times I am put on edge.

Most of the time when I've actually noticed a man staring at me, he looks pissed off. He looks angered by my existence. Not as a trans woman. No one can tell. Just angered by my existence as a regular woman, right out of the box.

And, you know? That's pretty unnerving. I've also experienced some pretty insane harassment from various men, so every angry stare is just a reminder of those experiences.

The only other times I notice a man staring at me are when it's not necessarily angry but it is just way. Too. Fucking. Long. One man at a restaurant hardly took his eyes off me for an entire hour. Another man leaned forward and stared at me, wide-eyed, stared at me for a full two hours in an emergency waiting room. As I moved around the room he physically turned his head and torso to continue staring at me intently. The whole gosh darn time.

That kind of staring obviously creeps me out. 

But the interesting thing I find is that, so far? No man has approached me. Well, except for the men who approached me to physically harass me. 

I think that odds are, some guy will probably approach me in a conversational way, (without trying to grope me). But it hasn't happened yet.

One guy did flirt with me a bit, but it was because I started talking with him when he was hanging around my neighborhood. Although I wasn't interested in the flirting, it was pretty flattering and it totally gave me an ego boost. Very pleasant experience. He also - was not at all - what a lot of people (weirdly) describe as ""a person of high social value."" He was pleasant and respectful. And he was super duper homeless. But his hygiene and clothing were pretty normal, so that probably helped the conversation a bit - to be honest.

What I've also noticed is a lot of guys looking at me a bit blushingly, without crazy staring or groping or anything. No anger, just a blushing look. So of course I was just flattered and went on about my day as normal.

The point is that of those men, I presume many of them were single. And they would have done well to ask me out. I would have politely declined and kept the conversation platonic, but i would have thanked them for their interest and maybe we'd end up as friends or acquaintances. 

Even more background:

Before I realized that it was gender dysphoria boggling my brain all the time, (and not something more normal - as I'd always presumed), I actually ""cold approached"" a lot of women in public to ask them out. Strangers about whom I knew nothing, and who knew nothing about me. 

Spoiler alert: It almost always was a pleasant experience. There were a few pretty rough situations, but 99 times out of 100 it was just a pretty normal interaction. The women were flattered, and I felt good about myself for flattering them. I made a few socially awkward mistakes but I apologized and the women accepted  my apologies. Many of them were impressed with my initiative. I kept getting more courageous and I kept getting better at making conversation and connecting with people. 

Some of the women were attracted to me but were in relationships (or ""talking"" to someone lol). Most of the women weren't attracted to me at all. But almost all of them were cordial and appreciative. 

And after ""cold approaching"" hundreds of women over the course of a few years, one woman was interested in going out for coffee! We fell in love and we had a messy relationship. She was awesome. I wouldn't change a thing. 

My experience has taught me this much: 

It's true that a ""cold approach"" doesn't usually work. At least it didn't for me. I had a lot more luck with asking out women whom I had some kind of social connection with, as well as with women I met on dating apps. Not a ton of luck, mind you! I was a virgin until four years ago. And at time of writing I am 29 😆. But nonetheless I did have more luck with those avenues of asking women out. 

Now - I'll give y'all this much: the ""cold approach"" is hard as hell. And it was at times depressing that it didn't work a whole lot. But it was also pretty darn rewarding and invigorating. And I wouldn't have met one of the great loves of my life if I hadn't done it, and done it a lot. The ""cold approach"" is a romantic journey full of fun and disappointment. 

I wouldn't be the same without it and I thank my lucky stars I was crazy enough to keep on giving it a go. 

So, y'all know what? Talk to women! I promise it can be done! Talk. To. Women!!! And if you can't do that, no worries. It takes guts. You can work your way up to it.

Get a lot of wholesome platonic connections and interactions under your belt. You can do that until you get the courage you need to talk to women. That's what I did. ",0,1764901621.0,WomenAreNotIntoMen,10,0.25,False

I (21M ) work at coffee shop in a small town where some people tend to come in regularly. This girl (24F) who id noticed for a couple months had been catching my eye more and more so I decided to start giving her free coffees. She got warmer and warmer towards me and I told myself that the next time she came in I would ask her on date. Coincidentally that same day she comes she tells me she’s moving the next day to another state. I decided to ask her on a date anyway because I felt that we were into each other and she said yes. The date went really well and I got her flowers and she seemed really appreciative and gave me a hug. She even stopped by my work the next morning to say goodbye and I gave her a hug and she left. 
A couple days go by and I decided to text her to see how she’s been doing and to ask her for instagram. She gives me her instagram but I’m starting to ruminate on our conversation. She replied to me almost instantly when I texted her but because it was around the holidays and we were both busy the texts got longer and longer apart. I’m worried because she replied instantly and then when she was with family she replied after, and then I replied after really long time. I’m just worried it looks like I texted her and then didn’t care enough to respond in time when I was really just waiting for a chance where we could consistently reply to each other and I feel like she may have been doing the same but the timing was always off. For example she texted me like 30 mins after I went to bed early for the night and it could totally look like I just didn’t want to respond when that isn’t the case. I could just leave this as a good experience and a good memory, but I clicked with her really well.
I haven’t fallen for someone in this way for years. She was warm and I really felt like she cared about seeing who I was.
My question for advice really is what I should I do next… I’m worried because I’m thinking well what if she’d want to keep contact but I messed it up with the responses. I know I could leave it be and let this just be a positive memory with a good person, but then there’s this other part of me that wants to try and see if it could work. She’s 2 states away and logically it’s irrational to peruse. But there’s this part of me that wants to just see her again or connect on a deeper level. It’s like there’s been a pull between us for a while that was building and building and eventually made us connect more just for the timing not to be in the cards and it’s messing with my head.",1,1764901594.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I've had it for about two weeks now and it is slowly driving me insane.   
  
At first I thought I wasn't able to empty my bladder fully and had large residuals. As I was having a hard time voiding after taking out the indwelling catheter.   I even did my first ever straight cath on myself and got back maybe 5cc -(I used to be a nurse many years ago so they gave me some straight caths to take home in case I needed them)  I thought maybe the straight cath didn't enter the bladder due to obstruction from swelling or something. Turned out after going to the urologist the bladder scan showed only 25cc residual. So I was completely wrong.  
  
I talked about it with my urologist when I came back for the post-op pathology report visit. He said this was common but didn't really give much in the way of advice to how to deal with the pain. I know I can't take any more Pyridium and the Ditropan that was prescribed for bladder spasms doesn't seem like an appropriate med. and could actually make it worse. All I do now is to use a heating pad over the area which helps a tiny bit (maybe) I've resigned myself to just grin and bare and hope it doesn't last much longer as the bladder wall heals.  
  
I am trying to drink more water, less coffee and anything acidic or soda. It seems worse if the urine is more concentrated so I do try to drink more. Even at night - as I wake up to pee no matter what - sometimes every 15 minutes to 1/2 hr. I'm fairly confident I don't have a UTI. ",2,1764901535.0,BladderCancer,3,1.0,False

He was a early proponent of standardizing Tagalog in the 1910s, and came out with several works of grammar including “Diksionariong Kastila-Tagalog”. He also ventured into the coffee and chocolate business, also opening a bakery under the name of La Patria along Legard St. facing Arellano University. I will look for the paper ad where he promotes ‘pan de americano’ i.e. tasty bread loaf. 

La Patria was passed down to my grandparents, eventually becoming a catering service and canteen. It lasted until the early 2010s when the ancestral compound in Sampaloc was sold (now it’s Lumera Tower condo). He is buried in our family mausoleum in La Loma Cemetery.

Although I never met him, we have many stories of Lolo Merto. He ensured his family lived as comfortably as possible and covered for all the tuitions of his apos, and sent the eldest (my uncle) to Wharton for an MBA. Everyone received cash gifts from him every Christmas with cards written in impeccable English. He had a very serious and formal personality; not surprising for his scholarly interests. Perhaps the most difficult moment for him was the death of his youngest son in an accident at the bakeshop.

In 1910 he published “Balarilang Tagalog” (Tagalog Gramatica), I’ll post the link later. As part of the growing body of Tagalog works, it paved the way for Tagalog to be the template for Wikang Pambanasa. He was also sued in 1918 for supposedly plagiarizing earlier Spanish-Tagalog dictionary by Pedro Laktaw. The American judge agreed it was indeed copyright infringement but refused Laktaw’s demand to that he be paid $10,000 in damages.

Born in the final years of Spanish rule then having lived through the American period, WWII and even martial law years, he belonged to a generation that witnessed many changes. He was fluent in Spanish and wrote extensively in it. But he also welcomed the new things brought by the US, and promoted American bread and the ‘modern’ oven in his bakery. Through it all his loyalty remained to his native tongue and the people who spoke it.",79,1764901449.0,FilipinoHistory,9,0.99,False
