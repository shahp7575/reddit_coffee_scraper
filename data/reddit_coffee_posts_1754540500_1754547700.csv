Saved some money and went on a trip to dehradun with Apollo tyres and Govt Of Uttarakhand, Something clicked there and when i came back i took a loan and started a cafe, cafe was going great When DDA’s Demolition drive happened,  they came in demolished all the structures but i managed to talk to the Dy. director and he didn’t demolish our structure, but gave me an ultimatum to vacate the place, Filed and RTI to know the Reason of demolition and why the due process of giving a notice was not followed DDA came short with any answer. Anyways I’m fighting that rn, Because I’m not gonna let this slide. Cafe got demolished in may last week, so i immediately started a Consultancy business, now i have 7 clients that i supply with fresh coffee, sauces and manage their remote inventory, help them reduce kitchen wastage and manage them to maintain a good quality of food, i also help people setup a cafe, and provide workshops on how to train their staff into making healthy food, (Wraps, Burgers, Sandwiches, Pizzas, Fries and Chinese food. Also some amazing quality and variety of coffee)

I laughed told him I’ll see him tomorrow again, and left, been a week didn’t get a chance to go home. anyways the same man who gave me a life told me last year that i should quit preparing for upsc as it was beyond me, and i would never crack it and I’m wasting my time, texts me on sunday that i should prepare for upsc and I should come meet him and talk.

## Key Features Analysis

The functionality and effectiveness of a gusset bag hinges on several crucial features. These include the material composition, sealing mechanism, gusset design, printing capabilities, and overall durability. Understanding these elements is essential for selecting the optimal gusset bag for your specific needs.

**Material Composition:** Different materials offer varying levels of protection, barrier properties, and aesthetic appeal. Common options include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET), and laminations of various films.The material used dictates the bag's resistance to tearing, puncture, and moisture. for food products,barrier properties against oxygen and light are critical to maintain freshness and extend shelf life,requiring specialized laminations like metallized films or aluminum foil. The choice depends on the product's sensitivity and the desired level of protection. Some manufacturers also offer eco-friendly options like biodegradable or compostable films to cater to sustainability concerns.

**Sealing Mechanism:** A reliable sealing mechanism is crucial for preventing leaks and maintaining product integrity. Options include heat sealing, zipper closures, and adhesive closures.

Heat sealing is a common method that creates a permanent bond between the layers of the bag, providing a strong and airtight seal. Zipper closures offer reclosability, making them ideal for products that require repeated access and resealing. Adhesive closures offer simplicity and convenience but may not provide the same level of security as heat sealing or zippers. The sealing method should be chosen based on the product's properties, the desired level of security, and the convenience factor for the end-user.

**Gusset Design:** The gusset is the folded portion of the bag that allows it to stand upright when filled. Common gusset types include side gussets, bottom gussets, and quad seal gussets.

Side gussets provide a classic and versatile design, while bottom gussets offer enhanced stability for heavier products. Quad seal gussets feature seals on all four corners, providing extra strength and a premium aesthetic. The gusset design influences the bag's overall shape, stability, and filling capacity. Selecting the appropriate gusset ensures the bag stands upright properly and effectively displays the product.

**Printing Capabilities:** High-quality printing is essential for branding and product facts.Options include flexographic printing, rotogravure printing, and digital printing.

Flexographic printing is a cost-effective option for large print runs, while rotogravure printing offers superior image quality and detail. Digital printing is ideal for short runs and personalized designs. The printing method influences the vibrancy, sharpness, and durability of the printed graphics. The choice depends on the budget, the desired level of print quality, and the quantity of bags required.

**Durability and Strength:** The bag must withstand the rigors of handling, transportation, and storage without tearing or rupturing.

The durability of a gusset bag depends on the material used, the quality of the seals, and the overall construction. Thicker materials and stronger seals provide greater resistance to tearing and puncture. Reinforced corners and edges can further enhance the bag's durability. Choosing a bag with adequate strength ensures that the product remains protected throughout its lifecycle,preventing damage and waste.

## core Benefits

The use of gusset bags provides several key benefits for both the product and the consumer. These benefits range from improved product presentation to increased consumer convenience and contribute to overall brand value.

**Enhanced Shelf Appeal:** Gusset bags stand upright on shelves, maximizing product visibility and attracting customer attention.

The upright design allows for prominent display of branding and product information, creating a more impactful presence on the retail shelf. This increased visibility can lead to higher sales and improved brand recognition.The clean, professional look of a gusset bag also conveys a sense of quality and value to consumers, further enhancing its shelf appeal.

**Increased Filling capacity:** The gusseted design expands to accommodate larger volumes of product compared to flat pouches.

The expandable gusset provides additional space without increasing the overall footprint of the bag. This allows manufacturers to pack more product into a single bag, reducing packaging costs and minimizing waste. The larger capacity is also beneficial for consumers, who receive more product for their money.

**Improved Product Protection:** Gusset bags, especially those with barrier films, offer excellent protection against moisture, oxygen, and light, preserving product freshness and extending shelf life.

This protection is crucial for perishable products such as food and beverages, and also sensitive items like pharmaceuticals. The barrier properties of the bag prevent spoilage, discoloration, and loss of flavor or potency. This ensures that the product reaches the consumer in optimal condition, maintaining its quality and integrity.

**Consumer Convenience:** reclosable options like zipper closures and easy-tear features provide added convenience for consumers.

Zipper closures allow for easy resealing, keeping the product fresh and preventing spills. Easy-tear notches make opening the bag effortless, eliminating the need for scissors or other tools. These features enhance the overall user experiance and increase consumer satisfaction.The convenience factor also encourages repeat purchases and builds brand loyalty.

I (19F) have this friend, Jade (also 19F), who recently got lip fillers. Ever since then, she won’t stop talking about how different life is now. She constantly brings up how guys are all over her, how she suddenly has “pretty privilege,” and how exhausting it is being noticed all the time.

I’ve been supportive, but it’s becoming every single conversation. The other day, while we were getting coffee, she started again, saying she “never asked to be this hot.” I kind of laughed and said, “It’s not that deep, Jade. You’re not the only one who gets attention.”

She went silent, left early, and now she’s not speaking to me. I later found out she told a mutual friend I was jealous, toxic, and “shaming her confidence.”

I didn’t mean to upset her. I just didn’t think what I said was that harsh. Now I’m second-guessing myself.

Alright, real talk. We absolutely destroyed our sleep schedule this summer. Like, completely obliterated it. 3am scrolling sessions, sleeping until 1pm, the whole disaster. Now everyone's back to normal schedules and we're over here looking like zombies.

But here's what actually worked for us (after trying literally everything else first):

**🏃‍♂️Get brutally honest about what's happening** We grabbed the LYNX Smart Ring because we needed a proper sleep quality tracker, not just guessing. Turns out we weren't just ""bad sleepers;” we were getting maybe 4 hours of actual restorative sleep even when we spent 9 hours in bed. Ouch.

[RENPHO LYNX](https://preview.redd.it/fs7mu73jdjhf1.jpg?width=4672&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=950af21ffeb8e5b6d51a83ad188a61f2cf075e13)

**👶Baby steps, not dramatic overhauls** Tried the whole ""bedtime at 9pm starting tomorrow"" thing. Epic fail. Instead, we shifted back like 25 minutes every couple days. Way less painful, and the ring showed our sleep efficiency actually improving week by week instead of crashing and burning.

**🧠Figure out what's sabotaging you** The data from the RENPHO Health App was eye-opening. That afternoon coffee? Wrecking our deep sleep. Room too warm? Sleep quality tanked. Weekend sleep-ins? Basically reset all our progress.

[RENPHO App](https://preview.redd.it/e7iagz9kdjhf1.jpg?width=4672&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75761c583fc0ed18aaa68c09b932875a6952d6d9)

**👊Make it stick somehow** We started checking our sleep scores together each morning, kind of like a weird family competition. Seeing those numbers go up kept us motivated when we wanted to stay up ""just one more hour.""

Now we're actually functional humans again, and honestly the whole process was way less awful than expected.

What about you guys? Anyone else crawling out of summer sleep chaos? What's been working for you?

Walk around Canmore: river walk, Main Street, local landmarks
Dinner + evening walk or chill at the accommodation

Breakfast in town, then head up the Banff Gondola
Midday walk to nearby viewpoints
Lunch + canoe rental on the Bow River
Relax with coffee or snacks
Evening bus back to Canmore
Dinner + optional evening drinks

Day 3 – Early trip to Moraine Lake + Lake Louise → optional canoe → hike to teahouse → return

Day 4 – Johnston Canyon hike in the morning → back to Banff/Canmore → return to Calgary → evening flight

**AITAH for still getting on a flight home when my two young coworkers I was traveling with weren’t at the airport yet and were obviously going to miss it?**

TL;DR: Went on a work trip with two junior employees (not on my team) and they missed the flight home because they went sight-seeing the day we were leaving. I still got on flight even though they weren’t at the airport.

Long version -

This past week I was presented with an industry award in Nashville that an agency partner nominated me for. I am a Director at my company. My Co decided to send two junior-level employees to the event as well because they thought it would be a good experience for them - a Specialist who has been with us a little over a year (25f, first job out of college) and a summer intern (21f, rising senior). They are not on my team (report up through separate VP) and I have very limited / no interaction with them in daily work life.

They were VERY excited to be going. This was going to be the Specialist’s first time on a plane, lots of Teams chats asking what to wear, etc. We were flying in Thursday morning and leaving Friday evening so it was a very short trip, but I tried to help share info about the event (types of attendees, awards reception/presentation Thursday night with a country western theme, then I was speaking on a panel Friday morning).

There’s so much I could say, but I’ll try to highlight key points:

Specialist barely made Thursday AM flight because she doesn’t have a Real ID and had to do extra screening. She had no idea what a Real ID was, or the basic rules of flying (liquid restrictions, etc.) She was VERY upset they made her throw away some of her skincare that was over 3oz. Thurs night event was country western theme, and while a majority of people there were business casual, Intern shows up in a bandana tube top, micro skirt, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. I pulled her aside and asked if she wanted to run upstairs and change since it was still a business event, but she said she was fine and she thought she looked cute and on-theme.

After ceremony I invite them to join me with some colleagues I knew from other Companies in the hotel bar, but they tell me they want to “check out Broadway”. I make a face and say this would be a good networking opportunity, they make “c’mon mom” jokes, and so I tell them to be safe and remind them the time and location of first session the next day. Text them around 11pm that I hope they got back safe, no response. Went to bed. Text them the next morning offering to meet them for coffee before morning sessions, no response.

No idea if they actually attended any sessions or saw my panel, but I did find them in the hotel lobby afterward looking incredibly hungover. Have about 2 hours after event is over and before we need to go to the airport, I invite them to late lunch with our agency partners. They decline because they want to go to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Again, make a face and say I don’t know if they will have time and I think it would be a good opportunity for them to spend time with our agency. They act like I’m the wet blanket so I tell them I’m leaving for airport from the hotel at 4pm sharp and meet me in lobby so we can share a Lyft. Text them at 3:45pm that Lyft is arriving in 15 mins, no response. Text them that Lyft has arrived and I’m leaving for airport, no response. Text them when I get to airport and tell them security line is long (neither had pre-check), no response.

Text them when I get to gate to please give me some sign of life, Intern sends very short response about 10 mins later: “In Lyft, there’s traffic.” Nothing else. Text them flight is starting to board, no response. Text them when I’m in my seat that boarding is about to end, no response. Doors close, they don’t make it, put my phone in airplane mode. Land a couple hours later to a barrage of texts from them. They’re “stranded in Nashville”, don’t know what to do, how to rebook, who to call for help, etc. I also have an angry voicemail from Specialist’s mom that I “abandoned her daughter in Nashville”, she has never flown and has anxiety, she’s having a panic attack at the airport and needs medical attention, she could be human trafficked (???). I call Specialist and Intern back, both phones ring but neither pick up. Text to see if they were able to rebook, no response. Forward them email with our business travel info with after-hours contact and text them that I sent the email, no response. Texted an hour or so later to see if they were okay, no response. Did not call the mom back.

Also have text from their Director (don’t know her well, just started with Co a couple weeks ago) asking what’s going on. I send her brief overview and screenshots of all my unanswered texts to them from earlier in the day along with the transcript of the vm I got from the mom. She acknowledges my response, but no further dialogue.

Now, I get an invite for a Monday morning meeting from that Director with their VP and our C-Suite leader. My VP is on PTO.

I feel like these are adults, I was communicative, and I’m ultimately not responsible for their decisions. But you tell me, AITA here?

**Comments**

**MissHibernia**

*I think that OP went incredibly above and beyond here considering that it was a WORK EVENT SHE WAS RECEIVING AN AWARD AT so to have these junior idiots causing any type of fuss was really an unnecessary hassle for her when it should have been a personal celebration*

>OOP: Okay thank you so much for saying this because I took it out of my main post since it was so long already, but I made a short acceptance speech after getting the award. I worked really hard on it and practiced a lot. It was only like 90 seconds but I asked Specialist and Intern to film it for me because I wanted to share it with my team members who helped me with it. Left my phone with them and everything but they “forgot” and that kind of upset me. It’s obvi not the end of the world but like, come on.

**Hari\_om\_tat\_sat**

*So they even failed at the only job you gave them with explicit instructions (“film my speech” — official speech at official event). Definitely worth including in your bullet points.*

**lychigo**

*You were there as their coworker, not as their mother. Firstly, no one should be expecting you to take care of them in that way. They're adults. And even when you did offer them direction and support, they didn't even have the decency to get back to you. And a call from her mom? Good Christ. I would come prepared with documentation and also let your supervisor know, even if they're on PTO that this is what was happening.*

**Mac1721**

*The call from her mom is what really gets me. As an adult, I fully understand calling your mom for help when you’re panicked, like this girl stuck at the airport with no flying experience. I would 100% call my mom if I were panicking in that situation. My mom, however, would help me get my shit together and clam down and solve the problem myself, not call another person on the business trip and yell at them for leaving me stranded. That far crosses the line*

**Apprehensive\_Mark\_20**

*They seem to have mistaken a business trip for a vacation. Also they acted irresponsibly around time, dressing, and networking possibilities. None of this is your fault. You are not their mother. You treated them like the adults they are, the fact that they didn't act like adults is not on you NTA.*

**RebeccaMCullen**

*After their behavior on this trip, I'll be surprised if they ever get a chance to go on another company funded trip, let alone still have a job.*

**fetgdry**

*Confirming you are female re the “c’mon mom” comment. This shouldn’t be, but is this a gendered issue that your company sent a senior female to do work and babysit two junior females?*

*I can understand never having flown before, but you went above and beyond to look after and help them. They aren’t you direct reports and frankly they didn’t do their job of actually benefiting from your experience and network. They took it as a chance to have a holiday.*

*If a colleague of mine was late, I wouldn’t be expected to miss my flight to help them. What you did was again above and beyond in trying to organise grown adults.*

*Re the meeting, if the people in attendance can impact your performance / bonus etc, I would strongly suggest emailing them to ask them what the meeting is about and reschedule when your VP is back.*

*If you don’t want to trouble your VP, I think that is fine also, but you should be prepared to make this an uncomfortable conversation for them as to why they think it’s ok to send two junior female employees to be babysit by another senior female employee. Would they expect this from a male colleague, my guess is probably not.*

*Good luck and update us!*

>OOP: Thanks for this comment. I don’t want to make this a gender issue, but if the meeting does turn on me on Monday I have been trying to find a way to professionally say, if it had been \[male counterpart on my team\] who went on this trip with the same outcome, would you be having the same conversation?

>Interestingly, perhaps, everyone on the meeting invite on Monday is a woman. My VP is male but on PTO so won’t be in attendance.

**Update - 1 day later**

**OOP replies in the crosspost from** r/redditonwiki **after the post was removed from** r/AITAH

(Insert “it’s meeeeee” Wicked meme here). This whole fiasco has really challenged my Reddit skills, lol. Here’s my update after my meeting this morning. If there is a better place/way to post it that won’t get me in Reddit jail, LMK:

Meeting over. CMO didn’t join. It was other VP and Director, plus the internship coordinator, who is in HR. VP asked all the questions. It was over Teams, on camera, recorded, almost comically formal, like I was being deposed or something.

During the meeting:

Was asked to recap what happened, starting from when we arrived. I was prepared, had all my key points. Kept it factual on my actions, no speculation on their actions.

I shared my phone screen live, went through the text messages with timestamps and the voicemail from Specialist’s mom.

I was asked if I had requested or encouraged Specialist to put any expenses on her P-card. This question took me by surprise. I said I didn’t even ask or consider that she had a P-card, and beside the Lyft from airport to hotel, which I scheduled/paid for, I was never outside of the hotel/official conference activities with either Specialist or Intern that would have required any sort of payment. I did say I would consider it to be her line manager’s responsibility to make sure she understood our travel and expense policies prior to traveling.

I was asked if at any point I had reached out to anyone at the office about anything that was transpiring, to which I said no, I certainly intended to when I returned, but we are talking about everything that happened within a 32-ish hour window, all while I was trying to focus on what I was sent there to do: participate as a panel member at the conference, attend other presentations, take advantage of face-to-face time with our agency, and accepting my award. I said I felt it was reasonable to believe any other attendees would have expectations for participation and outcomes set by their leadership team, especially when coming from another department, where I wouldn’t be knowledgable about their goals and objectives. Similarly, if there were different expectations of me based on other Co attendees, I would expect that to be clearly communicated in advance.

I was not asked if I thought Intern and/or Specialist should receive any sort of reprimand, and I didn’t feel comfortable trying to interject something like that based on the flow of conversation.

I’m under the impression that they’re meeting with Specialist and Intern separately, but my meeting was first.

After the meeting I debriefed with a trusted colleague, who shared the following from Friday “water cooler” chats:

I definitely offended Intern by pulling her aside about her outfit. She posted it to Snapchat with a caption about it, and some other interns/employees saw it. Dying to know what exactly it said, but coworker said everyone who did see it agreed it was inappropriate for a work event.

ALLEGEDLY Specialist’s mom had once called previous Director (who left, Director in meeting today replaced him) about Specialist’s working hours. It is known that several months ago Specialist was pulled off a high profile project team. Apparently when she was asked to put in some evening and weekend hours to meet a deadline, Mom called Director and complained. Don’t know if I believe this to be true but Mom stepping in could be a pattern.

What I’m hoping helps validate my “testimony” is separately on Friday, one of my agency partners I was with emailed my CMO about a conversation we had after the ceremony on Thursday evening with some ideas he had. Typical agency sales-y stuff, but he also unknowingly corroborated my alibi on Thursday night.

So, that’s where we are at. Last night I had convinced myself this all would result in me receiving a big apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and that I shouldn’t have had to deal with this, etc. But I didn’t, which makes me feel this is still a bit unresolved. I did send all my notes to my VP on Sunday, but his PTO is medical related and I know he’s not able to really check in, so just keeping my head down until I hear anything else.

**Comments**

**chrisff1989**

*Sounds like they paid for random stuff using their company card and tried to blame you for it. I'd be shocked if they keep their jobs*

**MSK165**

*Thank you for this update. You won’t get an apology. That’s not how this works. One of the leadership may tacitly acknowledge that their behavior was wrong, but your involvement in this saga is over. My prediction: this is a career-limiting event for both of them. Intern will not be receiving an offer, and specialist will be terminated for using her P-card for unapproved items. (The termination will actually be for her helicopter mother, but on paper it’ll be for expense policy violations.)*

**ShaneRealtorandGramp**

*Nah, both will be fired for unprofessionalism during their trip with the additional violation for the specialist charging improper stuff as well.*

*The specialist is really screwed because she will lose out on income and benefits. The intern is probably still in college so she can go through entry level recruitment but it's still going to be a pain and its a small world so news of the interns behavior will spread. The punishments they are getting match with how much both of them fucked up*

An AITAH Nashville Work Drama Final Update Original post (but IDK if you can even see it anymore): [https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/znzQLMx6vl](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/znzQLMx6vl)

Monday Meeting Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/s/d6cv5xzEQI](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/s/d6cv5xzEQI)

This will be my final update. It’s probably not going to be as juicy as you want it to be, but hopefully it provides some level of closure to this whole thing. This post will still be long because I generally have a problem with brevity and I have BIG feelings about this whole experience.

Here are the things I want to say. I bolded the topics so you can choose what interests you.

Was the post fake? No. I don’t really understand why it was flagged, what rules I broke, etc. I did alter some details to try and protect my identity (more on that later) but feel this is a generally acceptable Reddit practice. At the point where it was taken down it had already gone “viral” so I honestly appreciated the decline in notifications, lol. According to my DMs many people felt entitled that I provide them with “proof of authenticity” and it’s like, be so for real. I’m a human looking for advice on the internet not a gold plated, uncirculated, oversized, novelty Sacajawea quarter you buy from an infomercial in the middle of the night. If you don’t like something or think it’s fake or it’s not bringing you joy, just scroll on, it’s really easy to do. Threatening a stranger won’t prove anything or make your life better.

Was I actually doxxed? Yes. While I received many incorrect guesses at my true identity, there were a couple that were correct. And holy shit is that scary. I don’t know what compels a person to go to such lengths to try and figure out who a random internet poster is, but maybe don’t spend your time doing that? Unless it’s someone threatening to shoot up a school or bomb a concert venue, of course. Take those despicable monsters ALL the way down. But I’m just an elder Millennial trying to navigate imposter syndrome in corporate America, pay my bills and generally be a good person so one day I can hopefully retire and rescue a borderline concerning number of geriatric Pomeranians. Very unworthy of your CIA-caliber sleuthing. Please, make friendship bracelets or try diamond painting as a relaxing hobby instead. Or join the actual CIA and take down would-be school shooters and concert venue bombers.

Has anyone from my job seen my post? Yes, in some form. More than one person, in fact. Perhaps naively, this was something I never even considered would happen. It’s Reddit! It’s anonymous, and everything is cycled through in about 24 hours, right?!! But as soon as the reaction videos started coming across my FYP, a People Magazine (web) article?!!!!, and all the other ways this thing took on a life of its own … NGL I had pretty severe panic about this — like wow, I handled the situation as best I could and came out relatively unscathed, but me seeking validation of internet strangers will be what takes me out in the end. So far I have not been reprimanded over it… but I accept whatever comes of it. Not my most professional move to air out other’s not most professional moves on the Internet and I will seek a healthier outlet in the future. Maybe I’ll make friendship bracelets, or try diamond painting.

Will Specialist and/or Intern be fired? To my knowledge, they are both still employed, although today is the official last day for the entire summer intern cohort. I know how I would handle one of my team members if they did this (but I trust they would never, ever, ever, because they’re sensible and smart and amazing… and probably reading this) but for these two, it’s not up to me to decide. And while I take full accountability for bringing all gestures widely this on myself, I’m at a point where I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative within my actual place of work.

In conclusion For everyone who commented and sent such nice, supportive messages - thank you. Sincerely. I did get some good advice and I’m glad I could help you temporarily escape into someone else’s work drama, provide HR training material for new employees on travel policies, or maybe validate that whatever you did on your first work trip that creeps into your brain when you’re trying to fall asleep at night wasn’t actually that bad.

I took the rest of the week off, which may seem like an overreaction, but sometimes weird stuff impacts you in ways you aren’t prepared for. I’m going to use the time to rest, do a bit of reflection, and look at pictures of geriatric Pomeranians.

*If these interns don't get properly punished then it's proof to me they are effin' somebody or are related to the right people.*

**zephen\_just\_zephen**

*Meh. It's easy for an intern to not be invited back, but in a lot of places they'd still be paid for their three months even if they murdered another employee with witnesses, and were taken away in handcuffs. No company wants the reputation of not upholding their end of the intern social contract.*

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

I’m sitting here, sipping my usual cup of coffee, trying to put into words something that’s been swirling in my head... I guess what I really want to say is, it’s okay. It's okay if you’re feeliing like every day is a challenge and you’re just tring to keep it together when things feel like they're fallling apart.

We’re in this weird space together, you and I, even thouugh we've never met. There’s comfort in knowing that somewhere out thee, someone else might be feeling the same way. This moment, this feeling, it’s like standing at the edge of somefhing dauntnig but also kinda beauiful.

I wish I could tell you that it gets esaier, and maybe it does... eventually. For now, I hope you remember that it’s okay to pause and just breatye. It’s okay to not have all the answers. None of us do. Life is messy, and we don’t always have to be ""on"" it all the time.

So, hang in there and be gentle with yourself. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s more than enough.

Take care,

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **FC Copenhagen vs Malmö FF: A Qualifier for the Ages (or a Nap Inducer?)**

The first leg between FC Copenhagen and Malmö FF ended in a 0-0 draw so dull, even the grass on the pitch checked its phone for updates. But fear not, football fans—this return leg on August 12 promises to be *slightly* more thrilling, assuming we ignore the fact that both teams’ offenses might still be vacationing in “Goal-Scoring Paradise.”

**Parsing the Odds: A Spreadsheet of Desperation**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. FC Copenhagen, fresh off a 0-0 draw in the first leg, needs a win to advance. Their Mexican midfielder, Rodrigo Huescas, is their version of a Swiss Army knife—sharp, reliable, and playing 466 minutes this season (plus 270 in this qualifying phase). That’s 23 minutes more than a typical Netflix show’s runtime and about 12 minutes less than it takes to deep-clean a fridge. Meanwhile, Malmö’s defense has been so stingy, they’ve made “Denmark’s version of a wall” sound like a *National Geographic* documentary.

Historically, these teams are like two Swedish twins arguing over who’s taller—Malmö has a 52% win rate in head-to-heads, but Copenhagen’s “do-or-die” motivation could be the equalizer. The return match is in Copenhagen, where they’ve won 68% of home games this season. That’s not just a stat—it’s a promise, unless the referee is from Norway, in which case all bets are off.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Coffee IVs, and Existential Crises**  
Copenhagen’s Huescas is the team’s heartbeat, but he’s playing like a man who’s been mainlining espresso since January. At 466 minutes this season, he’s essentially a human metronome with cramps. Meanwhile, Malmö’s star striker, *insert name here*, has been sidelined… well, actually, no one’s sure where he is. The team’s latest press release just said, “He’s unavailable. Probably.”

On the flip side, Malmö’s coach has been spotted practicing penalty kicks with a soccer ball and a life-sized cardboard cutout of a Copenhagen defender. It’s either inspiring or deeply sad, depending on how you feel about existential dread.

**Humorous Spin: Football as a Metaphor for Modern Life**  
This tie is like a stalemate between two overqualified interns—everyone’s trying their best, but the coffee machine is broken, and the boss keeps asking for “innovation.” Copenhagen’s attack is so patient, they’ve given new meaning to the phrase “slow and steady never scores.” Malmö’s defense? So solid, they’ve made “parking and staring” look like a Olympic sport.

If Huescas keeps playing at this pace, he’ll break the record for “Most Minutes Played Without a Nap.” And let’s not forget the Mexican angle: If Copenhagen falters, Mexico’s Champions League hopes go down with them. Imagine the Mexican federation sending a thank-you note to Malmö for “voluntarily erasing our presence from European football.”

**Prediction: Who Will Win?**  
Copenhagen’s got the home advantage, Huescas’ assist on their side, and a desperation that makes them dangerous. Malmö’s defense is brick, but brick eventually cracks under the weight of expectation.

**Final Verdict:** Bet on FC Copenhagen to scrape past Malmö in a 2-1 thriller, with Huescas scoring the winner after a play so intricate, it’ll take Wikipedia 10 pages to diagram. If it’s a draw? Prepare for penalties—because nothing says “thrill-a-minute” like 11 men staring down a ball like it owes them money.

*Go Copenhagen, or go home… and maybe bring a sleeping bag, just in case.* 🇩🇰⚽

Total nonsense. It’s been there forever and is fully approved with all the paperwork. A city official came by, did a walkthrough, confirmed everything was in order, and left without an issue.

The neighbor, though? Smirking. Acting like he’d won something.

So I did a bit of research.

Turns out his recently-installed hot tub was set up far too close to the fence line and actually sat right on top of a public drainage access.

I filed a report. Included pictures. Cited local zoning regulations.

A couple weeks later, he got a notice requiring him to either relocate it (not doable) or dismantle it completely. The whole thing had to go. Tens of thousands gone just like that.

Now he gets to stare at our totally compliant greenhouse every morning while sipping coffee next to a patch of gravel where his hot tub used to be.

**You must have the Tesla app**. I'm a (bit of a) crusty old f...ellow, so I try to avoid having apps of everything. No getting around this one though. Make sure you have billing information (credit card, address) entered in the app. You can, of course, enter it when you get to the supercharger, but might as well have it set up ahead of time.

**Only some** supercharger stations are able to charge the Ioniq 5. (Not sure what the technical limitations are, but I'm assuming it has to do with the electronics installed at the station vs. what's actually needed to charge non-Tesla cars). Sign-in to the app, add the car, and it'll show you compatible stations. (For instance, the nearby Target has a bank of superchargers, but they're pretty old so they don't work with the I5).

I5 (NACS) charging door is on the right (passenger) side, whereas most (all?) Teslas have it on the driver side. The charging stations are optimized for Teslas (obviously), which means if you're charging an Ioniq, **you might end up ""eating"" an extra stall** (the wire length - at least where I was - isn't enough to wrap around the car to the other side).

**Select charging stall first**, before you plug the cable into the car. Once the cable is plugged in, the charging stall is treated as ""occupied"" by the app.

My Tesla location charged about **$0.15 less** than the nearby EVGo fast charger ($0.52 vs $0.69 per kWh) and no session fee. Other nearby superchargers were $0.63 (still cheaper, but less so). (I'm only comparing against EVGo because I don't have another network's DCFC in a convenient distance)

But... Supercharger **maxes out at about 130 kW** when charging the Ioniq (I saw a peak of 127, 42 kWh in 21 mins), which felt like an *eternity*. My earlier experience with EVGo was - plug in, grab coffee, have some of the coffee, car is charged from \~30% - 80%. The extra waiting time *feels* long (frustration ∝ (waiting\_time)^(2) or some such).

Overall - works great, would do it again, if I have stuff to do for 45 mins. Otherwise, I'll definitely prefer an actual 250+ kW charger.",1,1754544424.0,Ioniq5,3,0.6,False

***Hoarding***

*A life is like a home.*

*You start somewhere and it’s fresh and empty and full of light and potential.*

*You start selecting key items, little touches. The local coffee shop, a friendly neighbor, your favorite coworker…*

*Bringing them home and furnishing out your new place. Over time you develop bigger pieces; a new hobby, a circle of friends, maybe a relationship. Your home is full of beautiful reminders of your full life.* 

*It’s cozy and cluttered and every surface has pieces from all the loving touches you are surrounded by, more added everytime you interact with friends or play sports or get coffee or go to work....* 

*But then.*

*You’re running out of space. The bookshelves are two rows deep and precarious piles block the hallway. The paintings on the wall are overlapping, only showing part of each picture. The nick nacks and thoughtful ornaments are crammed into cupboards, hearts beating against the door in the night. You move carefully around rickety stacks, breathing shallowing in the dim dusty spaces. The high windows were all blocked with loving gifts long ago and you can’t really remember where they had been anyway, the architecture of the rooms having shrunk and warped with the influx of moments.*

*You sit huddled on the floor, not daring to breathe too deep or move too suddenly lest the towers around you collapse and crush you.*

*The doorbell rings. A friend wants to see you. Misses you. Loves you. They have brought you a beautiful present they know you’ll love. And they’re right. You treasure every experience with this amazing, smart, vibrant human. But you can’t move. The piles are too high, the room too dark, the air too thick. More come to the door. Coworkers, team mates, club members, neighbors, family, friends…. They miss you, they have gifts, they love you.* 

*You huddle on the floor and you cry, a single flickering candle throwing the shadow of your sobbing self grotesquely up the clutter.*

*Eventually spent, you stare into the heart of the warm yellow flame. Watch it slowly burn down the wick and wax over hours, shrinking away to the inevitable end. You wait for the darkness and despair at the heartbeats in the cupboards, the cooing of the artworks, the invitations at the door.*

*The candle sparks, catching a stray dust mote and flaring like a tiny firework. You pick a dustball up from the floor and carefully drop it into the flame, watching it catch and twinkle before vanishing into nothing.* 

*As if on its own, your hand finds a stray piece of paper, a letter from a dear cousin. It touches one corner gently to the flame, teasing it along one edge until the whole page is alight then dropping it back onto the floor.* 

*Not the floor. You watch it lazily float down onto a pile of drawings, next to a box of pencils, atop of a pile of books. Mesmerized, still curled into a ball, you watch the flames jump from piece to piece, leaving behind nothing. The fire grows, warming and lighting the room. You can see for the first time the true extent of the hoarding mass you’ve accumulated. More love and joy and moments than any one person deserves and all waiting to crush you.*

*Fire eats away at the walls, devouring pictures and melting ornaments, swallowing whole trips away and birthday celebrations and joyous adventures indiscriminately.*

*Smoke fills the ceiling, a black choking sky of soot and suffocation. Underneath tho, in your fetal ball, you can see a sliver of light. A single beam, piercing thru the smoke and black, dusty and tired but brighter than anything around it. You watch it grow as the fire eats away more and more of the piles, feel your heart stir as the heartbeats in the cupboards quiet, and the paintings fall silent. And still the light grows, until you can see a path. A window. You crawl, muscles aching from disuse and lungs scratchy with dust and smoke. Burning your hands, pushing aside shouldering piles, you fight to the light.* 

*And then you are out. Pulling deep breaths of fresh air into your lungs and standing tall for the first time. Stretching your arms without fear of toppling memories. You shake your head, clearing cinders from your hair and mind, and walk forward towards a new home, inferno at your back casting your shadow long in front of you, guiding the way.*

I (19F) have this friend, Jade (also 19F), who recently got lip fillers. Ever since then, she won’t stop talking about how different life is now. She constantly brings up how guys are all over her, how she suddenly has “pretty privilege,” and how exhausting it is being noticed all the time.

I’ve been supportive, but it’s becoming every single conversation. The other day, while we were getting coffee, she started again, saying she “never asked to be this hot.” I kind of laughed and said, “It’s not that deep, Jade. You’re not the only one who gets attention.”

She went silent, left early, and now she’s not speaking to me. I later found out she told a mutual friend I was jealous, toxic, and “shaming her confidence.”

I didn’t mean to upset her. I just didn’t think what I said was that harsh. Now I’m second-guessing myself.

I recently moved to N. Austin from W. Europe, and while I'm loving the vibe of the city, I feel a little homesick for the food and general products. I'm talking about the everyday grocery items, chocolate, coffee, cheeses or basically, I pretty much miss everything!

This got me wondering, what's the general feeling in the US or specifically Austin about consumer goods from Europe? I think the closest (or better) I have seen are Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, and while they have some options, they are quite pricey.

I'm thinking of starting a small business to bring more European groceries to Austin and hopefully one day build the whole process/manufacturing here in Texas locally. But before I pour my life savings into it, I wanted to get a reality check. For instance:

1. Do you care where your groceries come from? Is having authentic, imported European products something that interests you?
2. Would you actively seek out and eat European food products?
3. Would you pick up an International brand product if it were cheaper than a domestic brand?
4. What would you consider a fair price for these items? Is slightly expensive ok? (Although the products in Europe are quite cheaper than what I have witnessed here, the cost of bringing them here when included will probably bring the prices back up to what we pay here for domestic brands)
5. Any opinions on FDA vs EU Food Regulations? (for instance, EU food regulation requires strict labeling for GMOs, thus there are very little GMO products in the public space)
6. Do you care which brand / company your money is going into?

I'd be grateful for any comments, thoughts, or even just a ""hey, that's a shitty idea!"" to see if this is something worth pursuing.

Thanks for your time, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think

His days were consumed with tinkering, adjusting intricate automation systems to coax higher yields from the nutrient-starved fields. His creations, droids that wove through crops with precision, irrigation networks that sang with efficiency, had transformed struggling farms into beacons of productivity. Justus was no ordinary technician; he was a connoisseur of circuits and soil, a man whose innovations fed thousands. Yet, despite his contributions, the corporate overseers of Bogden's agro-complexes regarded him as expendable.

One gray morning, under the hum of the dome's air recyclers, Justus was summoned to the overseer's office. The words were cold, mechanical: downsizing, redundancies, regrettable but necessary. His position was terminated, effective immediately. Devastated, Justus stumbled out into the acrid air, his mind reeling. He had a family to feed, his wife, Lira, and their two children, Kael and Miri. The mortgage on their modest home loomed like a specter, and without his income, eviction became a grim certainty, hunger a looming threat. For the first time in years, Justus felt the weight of helplessness settle into his bones.

Days turned into weeks, and a blur of desperation engulfed him. Job applications vanished into the void of Bogden's cutthroat labor market, each rejection echoing like a funeral knell in his mind. Justus's savings dwindled, and Lira's worried glances grew heavier each night. The children, sensing the tension, grew quiet, their laughter replaced by cautious whispers. Justus lay awake, staring at the flickering ceiling panels of their home, wondering how his world had unraveled so quickly.

In those early days of unemployment, Justus tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy. He would rise each morning, dress in his best clothes, and sit at the kitchen table with a cup of weak coffee, a laptop open before him. Each click of the keys felt like a small act of defiance against the encroaching despair. He scoured job boards, sending applications far and wide, but the responses were dishearteningly few. The agro-complexes were tightening their belts, and talent like his was becoming a surplus.

Lira, ever practical, took on odd jobs to help make ends meet. She had a knack for organizing community events, and her skills were in demand, even if the pay was meager. Justus admired her resilience, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing them all. The weight of his family's future pressed heavily on his shoulders.

One evening, as he walked home from yet another fruitless job fair, a shimmer caught his eye. A holo-advertisement flickered to life on the public display outside their unit. Its vibrant colors cut through Bogden's perpetual haze. The words ""Adasca BioMech"" glowed in bold, accompanied by images of majestic mountains, state-of-the-art facilities, and sprawling underground cities pulsating with opportunity. The voiceover was warm and inviting: ""Adasca BioMech welcomes talented minds to build a future where hard work is rewarded, where families thrive, and where dreams take root.""

Justus felt a spark of hope, fragile but undeniable. That night, he researched Adasca BioMech, learning about its reputation for fostering innovation and supporting its employees. The recruitment program was rigorous but fair, designed to attract the best minds from struggling worlds like Bogden and Champala. Without hesitation, Justus submitted his application, pouring his heart into every detail of his experience. Lira, ever pragmatic, cautioned him about the risks of uprooting their lives, but she saw the fire in his eyes and agreed to take the leap.

The recruitment process was a whirlwind. Virtual interviews probed Justus’s technical expertise, from debugging neural networks to optimizing hydroponic systems. He felt the familiar thrill of problem-solving as he answered questions, his confidence slowly returning. Personality assessments tested his resilience and adaptability, qualities he had honed in the unforgiving world of Bogden's agro-complexes.

Within three weeks, a message arrived, its subject line glowing: ""Offer of Employment – Adasca BioMech Corps."" Justus read it aloud to Lira, his voice trembling with disbelief. The offer included a generous salary, housing support, and access to top-tier schools for Kael and Miri. It was more than a job; it was a lifeline. They embraced, tears of joy mingling with the anxieties that had haunted them for months.

The move to Arkania was a whirlwind of activity. Justus and Lira packed their lives into boxes, each item a memory of their time on Bogden. The children were excited and apprehensive, their wide eyes taking in the change. As they traveled to their new home, Justus felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. What awaited them in this new world?

Upon arrival, they were greeted by the crisp air of Arkania, a stark contrast to the acrid atmosphere of Bogden. Their new home in the Verdant Hills district was a marvel, twice the size of their old one, with floor-to-ceiling windows framing rolling tundras and distant mountains. The colors of the landscape were vivid and alive, a testament to the thriving ecosystem that surrounded them. Justus inhaled deeply, feeling the fresh air fill his lungs, and for the first time in months, hope unfurled within him.

Kael and Miri quickly adapted to their surroundings, enrolling in a school that emphasized both academics and exploration. They spent weekends hiking trails and building droids with Justus in their spacious garage workshop. Lira, who had taken a part-time role as a community planner, marveled at the colony’s vibrant social fabric. Neighbors greeted one another warmly, and community events buzzed with life. The sense of belonging was palpable, a stark contrast to the isolation they had felt on Bogden.

Justus’s work at Adasca BioMech was fulfilling in ways he hadn’t imagined. He led a team designing autonomous harvesters for Arkania’s vast underground orchards, blending his agricultural expertise with cutting-edge technology. He collaborated with brilliant minds from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their unique perspectives to the table. His contributions were valued, his ideas celebrated. For the first time in years, he felt seen, not as a cog in a machine but as a creator, shaping a better future.

The days turned into months, each one filled with new challenges and triumphs. Justus reveled in the problem-solving opportunities that came his way. A particularly complex project required him to integrate AI into the harvesters, allowing them to learn from their environment and optimize their efficiency. Late nights in the lab became a routine, but he thrived on the energy of innovation, fueled by the knowledge that his work was making a difference.

One afternoon, while reviewing progress reports, Justus received a message from his supervisor. ""We’d like you to present your findings at the upcoming innovation summit,"" it read. His heart raced at the thought. This was a chance to showcase his work on a grand stage, to share his vision with leaders in the industry. He spent days preparing, meticulously crafting his presentation and rehearsing until every word felt natural.

The day of the summit arrived, and Justus stood before an audience of engineers, scientists, and corporate leaders. As he spoke passionately about the potential of autonomous technology to revolutionize agriculture, he could feel the excitement in the room. He shared stories of his family’s journey, the struggles they had faced, and how Adasca BioMech had given them a second chance. By the time he concluded, the audience erupted in applause, and for the first time, Justus realized the depth of his impact.

After the presentation, he was approached by several attendees, eager to discuss collaborations and explore his ideas further. Justus felt a rush of validation, a sense that his voice mattered, that he belonged in this community of innovators.

As the sun of Arkania slowly set that evening, Justus stood with his family on the balcony, watching the sky transform into a canvas of amber and violet. Lira wrapped her arms around him, and they shared a quiet moment of reflection. Adasca BioMech and the Arkanians had given them more than a home; they had restored their hope, their purpose, and their dreams.

In this land of opportunity, the Augustas were no longer just surviving, they were thriving. Justus felt a deep sense of gratitude for the chance to build a life where his skills were recognized and appreciated. He looked at Lira and the children, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of the setting sun, and knew that they had found a new beginning.

With each passing day, Bogden faded into memory, a distant echo of hardship that had transformed into a story of resilience. Justus had not only carved out a place for himself in Arkania; he had forged a path for his family, ensuring that they would never face the same darkness again. The future stretched before them, vast and inviting, a tapestry of possibilities woven from the threads of hope and hard work.

As they stood together, Justus felt a renewed sense of purpose. The challenges of the past had shaped him, but they would not define him. In his heart, he knew that he was more than an engineer; he was a creator, a dreamer, and a father determined to nurture the seeds of inspiration and innovation in the hearts of his children. Together, the Augustas would continue to thrive, crafting their narrative of resilience in a world where hope could take root and flourish.

I think I’m headed back into some of MC’s darker or moodier colors for a while (but with glitter and shimmer and flakes, too, of course).  

I have Shattered Glass on right now. I never even intended to buy this color, but after a cart error on my part, it joined my collection.  I think I used it for one nail on a skittle like six months ago, and never picked it up again. I’m quite sure linear holos aren’t for me (I’m not in the sun or bright lights enough for them to really shine - indoor kid for life), so I never felt drawn to wearing Shattered Glass.  This week I’ve been especially moody, and didn’t want to “waste” any of my beloved colors on a mani for a crappy week, so I pulled out SG.  Well, it turns out that I really do like this color!  😲 The shade of purple is nice and semi-neutral  indoors or in indirect lighting. It reminds me of the shade of purple in After the Rain. The formula is very smooth, applies easily, and dries well.  Just an easy, pleasant polish to use. And of course, hitting it with direct sunlight or the flash shows off the dramatic sparkles, too!  ✨ So Shattered Glass has moved up the ranks a few spots, and while I don’t think I’ll shop for linear holos, I will definitely get good use from this one and enjoy this bottle.  

Blame My Star Sign was a reward and I’m so glad I grabbed it!  It is sooo sparkly.  I added an extra coat of Speed Demon on day 2 because it still felt a little textured (so much glitter!!).  I agree with another poster who described it as glitzy tv static.    📺 

And good ol’ Queen of the Dead. My first thermal ♥️  I never really thought of thermals as being ideal summer polishes, but I’ve changed my mind!  I found that in the warmer weather, whether indoors or out, I got to see a lot more variety of cold/hot/gradient colors in my mani compared to when I use thermals in colder months.  Maybe everyone else already knew this, but this is my first summer with Mooncat 🌞  While outdoors taking the photos, my nails were in the warm state, but I touched my iced coffee to show the cold color.  Super fun, reactive polish and I love both the warm and cold colors. 

Mani 1- 1x Hardcore base coat, 3x Shattered Glass, 1x Sally Hansen Insta-Dri qdtc   (2 coats of SG is sufficient, but I messed up some spots, and just gave them all an extra coat) 

Mani 2- 1x Hardcore base coat, 1x Getting Even primer, 2x Blame My Star Sign, 1x Speed Demon, plus an additional 1x thick coat of Speed Demon on day 2

Hey Travel Trotters! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. Just got back from an absolutely mind-blowing trip to Berlin and I HAD to share why booking a local guide was the best decision I've ever made while traveling.

Berlin isn't your typical European city with pretty buildings and neat rows of tourist attractions. It's messy, complex, layered with history, and wildly creative - which is exactly why you need someone who really KNOWS the place to show you around!

## The Berlin You Won't Find in Guidebooks 🕵️‍♀️

My guide Marriette (20-year Berlin veteran) showed me sides of the city I would have completely missed. Those hidden courtyards? MAGICAL. We wandered through these secret spaces tucked behind ordinary-looking buildings, each one telling its own story about Berlin's past and present.

One courtyard had this amazing little café where locals were sipping coffee next to a tiny art gallery showcasing emerging Berlin artists. Another had remnants of bullet holes from WWII preserved alongside vibrant street art. The contrast was stunning and something I'd have walked right past without knowing.

## Real Stories Hit Different 💭

The history books tell you facts, but local guides give you the human stories that make those facts matter. Standing at a preserved section of the Berlin Wall, Marriette told me about a Finnish traveler on one of her tours who shared how his father had helped an East Berliner escape during the Cold War by lending his passport. These men stayed friends for life! Stories like these make history tangible in ways museums just can't.

## Food Scene: Skip the Tourist Traps! 🍽️

OMG the FOOD in Berlin! But you'll miss the best spots if you stick to the main tourist areas or (heaven forbid) international chains. My guide took me to this tiny corner spot that's been serving the most incredible schnitzel since the 1950s. The owner came out and shared stories of how his grandfather started the place right after the war.

We also hit up this ultra-modern vegan place that somehow made plant-based versions of traditional German dishes that would fool even the most dedicated meat-eater. Berlin's food scene is this wild mix of traditional and innovative that perfectly mirrors the city itself.

## Berlin Never Stops Evolving 🏗️

What makes Berlin especially tricky for travelers is that it's CONSTANTLY changing. That cool neighborhood from your 2019 guidebook? Completely different now. The abandoned factory-turned-club that everyone raved about? Might be luxury apartments today.

My guide knew exactly which areas were emerging as the new creative hotspots, which former tourist attractions had become too commercialized, and which underground events were worth checking out. This kind of real-time local knowledge is absolutely priceless.

## The ""Slow Travel"" Philosophy 🐢

Something that really stuck with me was my guide's philosophy on travel. She talked about her dream trip to Japan and how she'd want to experience it - not rushing between tourist sites but really immersing herself in daily rituals and unique cultural aspects (she was particularly fascinated by Japan's vending machine culture!).

This approach to travel - slowing down, going deeper rather than wider - has completely changed how I'm planning my future trips. Quality over quantity, every time.

## How to Find Your Perfect Berlin Guide 🔍

After my experience, I'm convinced that finding the right guide is worth every penny. Here's what to look for:

1. Someone who actually LIVES in Berlin (not someone who moved there 6 months ago)
2. A guide with knowledge in areas you're specifically interested in (art, history, food, etc.)
3. Someone whose personality and communication style you click with

Don't be afraid to ask questions before booking! The best guides are passionate about sharing their city and will be happy to chat about what they can offer.

## Pro Travel Tip 💡

I used this amazing booking platform I discovered to find my guide and it was super easy to filter by city, interests, and even languages spoken. They connect you directly with local experts who design personalized experiences. It's also the same site I'm using to plan my next adventure!

If you're heading to Berlin (or honestly anywhere), check out [this link](https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H) - it's been a game-changer for how I travel now.

## Final Thoughts 🌟

Looking back at my photos, the Berlin I experienced with a local guide feels like a completely different city from what my friends saw on their self-guided tours. The stories, the hidden spots, the authentic food, the cultural context - these are the things that transform a trip from ""nice vacation"" to ""life-changing experience.""

I’m on day 5 of recovery now and getting better (thank god). I realised this morning I haven’t drank coffee the whole time, since I’ve barely been able to eat or drink at all, and I’m thinking I should just keep going with it? 

Been saying I want to quit coffee for ages. It’s expensive, and pointless, although I do love the taste. But it offers very little benefit. Think I might just continue on with the decaf life. ",4,1754543362.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I (19F) have this friend, Jade (also 19F), who recently got lip fillers. Ever since then, she won’t stop talking about how different life is now. She constantly brings up how guys are all over her, how she suddenly has “pretty privilege,” and how exhausting it is being noticed all the time.

I’ve been supportive, but it’s becoming every single conversation. The other day, while we were getting coffee, she started again, saying she “never asked to be this hot.” I kind of laughed and said, “It’s not that deep, Jade. You’re not the only one who gets attention.”

She went silent, left early, and now she’s not speaking to me. I later found out she told a mutual friend I was jealous, toxic, and “shaming her confidence.”

I didn’t mean to upset her. I just didn’t think what I said was that harsh. Now I’m second-guessing myself.

Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD in London :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad in the US and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house.

There were hundreds of harsh comments, but they all fell away because one quiet kindness spoke louder than all of them combined. That’s all it took.

A kind stranger whom I now lovingly call Trust reached out. I shared all the details he needed, and he helped in the most quiet and beautiful way. He welcomed my brother in, gave him a full tour of the entire place, and then sat with him over breakfast and coffee. They spoke for a while, and in those few moments, a dream was fulfilled — not just the Google visit, but the feeling of being seen, welcomed, and treated with such grace.

It reminded me how powerful this platform can be, how real kindness still flows here.

To Trust — thank you 🥺🤍✨
You made the distant wish feel gently real.
To Reddit — you made this happen.
To those who reached out — your presence was felt, even in silence. Thank you, softly.

-------‐-----------------------------------------------------------
Fact:
Water Solubility of Chicory is 75% and Coffe is just 20%
Coffee Grounds: Much of the structure is cellulose and lignin (insoluble unless pressure brewed). Solubles like caffeine and melanoidins extract slowly and incompletely in plain water.

Chicory Grounds: Contain high inulin, fructose, and caramelized sugars from roasting — these dissolve rapidly in hot water with no need for brewing pressure.
‐----------------------------------------------------------------
This means its difficult to extract Coffee, where a filter coffee is poured our by hot water and filtered within 5-10 minutes where most of the Chicory gets into your decoction (75%) while just 20% Coffee. 

So essentially you will be drinking 50% chicory that completely masks all the beautiful flavourful compounds of coffee!!

1mjqzvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1mjqzvb/can_reversible_pulpitis_following_a_large_filling/,"Can reversible pulpitis (following a large filling near the pulp) be long-lasting or continual, generally improved rather than worsened by cold water, severe enough to interfere with sleep, and poorly managed to OTC painkillers, or are those features sufficient to guarantee that it is irreversible?","About a week ago, I had a large filling done that extended under the gum-line. For a couple days, it seemed fine, but then it began to hurt most or all of the time. The severity varies substantially, and most spikes in severity are not associated with any obvious cause. Pressure on the tooth causes pain, but cold and sugar do not. (I haven't tested coffee-level heat, but warm food isn't obviously bad, provided that it's eaten in a way that doesn't push on the tooth in question.) In fact, when it's particularly bad, cold (up to a point) seems to _help,_ by providing a numbing effect. For the past several nights, I've lost multiple hours of sleep per night to pain, but in all cases, I _have_ been some to get _some_ sleep (at least several hours), eventually. 

On Monday, I saw my dentist again, and his assessment, based on examination and x-rays, was that while irreversible pulpitis was possible, it was more likely that this is reversible, but that it may take some time for it to get better. On the other hand, on the pages you can find ask over the web contrasting characteristics of reversible and irreversible pulpitis, this matches the ones generally listed for irreversible pulpitis a lot better. I'd say that it has gotten worse since Monday, but not dramatically so.

So my basic question is: Is this level of symptom severity actually enough to guarantee irreversibility (in which case, I'd like to have the tooth devitalized as soon as possible, to spare myself additional pain), or is it realistically possible to have filling-induced pulpitis that is this bad, but that will eventually resolve on its own (other than by death of the nerve) if given time?",1,1754542307.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

If your ideal morning starts with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, you’re about to experience a game‑changer. A quality espresso machine doesn’t just brew coffee—it crafts a moment of pleasure, right in your kitchen. Home baristas, rejoice: your café dreams are about to come true with a single upgrade.

Why Upgrade to an Espresso Machine?

Everyone loves great coffee, but not everyone stops to think what makes espresso so special. Here’s why an espresso machine isn’t just another kitchen gadget—it’s a lifestyle improvement:

Barista‑quality espresso at a fraction of the cost of café visits

Custom shot strength, milk foam, and temperature to suit your mood

Your morning, your way—without the lines or the rush

Impress friends with lattes and cappuccinos made right at home

Once you’ve had a perfectly pulled shot, there’s no turning back.

Key Features to Look For

To find the right machine for your kitchen and your taste, look for:

1. A powerful pressure system (9 bars or higher) for authentic flavor

2. Built‑in grinder for freshly ground beans every time

3. Milk frother or steam wand for café‑style milk drinks

4. Generous water tank—fewer mid‑brew refills

5. Removable parts for fast and easy cleaning

6. Compact footprint that fits your countertop without dominating it

Semi‑automatic machines give you creative control while keeping things effortless.

1mjqxt9,https://i.redd.it/wi2qyzs92jhf1.jpeg,First Fall Haul :D,"Got a few candles and some of the new Vanilla Cafe FFMs,,, so, so good. So, so happy I blind bought these scents. Coffeebara was also too cute to pass up,,, what a distinguished little guy.

A little review/rating;

Autumn Evening; 6/10 I was really excited for this one, but the scent isn't very strong?? It's pleasant in the candle, i'll have to see if the throw is strong, though I read reviews that said it may not be.

A Day At The Cafe; 10/10 oh. my god. It literally smells like I stuck my nose into a Caramel Macchiato. SO mad at myself I didn't buy a second one of this one... yet >:)

Acorn Lane; 10/10. hands down. Perfect fall scent for me. Ohhh my gosh. I had to buy two more in a separate haul (coming later next week i believe) because it is that good. omg. The apple... the crisp, cozy scent... it's like if leaves and spiced apple toddy had a baby. Yeah... perfection. (unless you hate those candles... then uh... go you?)

Fresh Fall Morning; 8/10, one I was indeed excited to get, and am still INSANELY happy with. I only docked it just a teense because the eucalyptus comes off just a little strong for me? But I got two, and one is stronger than the other so maybe it's just a little inconsistent between candles.

Pumpkin Donut Shop; 7/10, I see why people don't smell the 'pumpkin'... but I do get a very very faint note of pumpkin pie spice. A very yummy, yeasty donut scent. Like if you made homemade starter, baked them in house, and then sprinkled a bit of spice and sugar into the mix. I do still like it quite a bit, just not as much as I hoped.

Pumpkin Carving; see why I saved this for last? yeah? no notes. this is IT guys. So halloween-y, so pumpkin-y, so absolutely perfect to get you in the mood for the spooky season. Now, yes, I may be biased as this is my favorite holiday and time of year... but with something as perfect as this scent, I think I'm right to think that way. 10000000000/10. infinity. whatever, i'll be back next week with another haul anyway :P

oh yeah Vanilla Cafe...; she's so hot I love her. Literally becoming one of most favorite mists besides Snowflakes & Cashmere, and Secret Wonderland. (I miss u bbg.) The coffee note is not the most synthetic thing i've ever smelled, and that's why it's so perfect. Sometimes BBW's coffee scents just don't land right with me, and two out of this haul have coffee notes, AND HIT IT OUT DA PARK !!!!!!!

I’m James, a UK-born photographer now based in Australia, and Japan is one of my busiest destinations. In the past few seasons I’ve helped couples file paperwork in Tokyo ward offices, organised Shinto blessings in Kyoto shrines, planned symbolic mountaintop vows in Nagano and shot partnership-certificate ceremonies for LGBTQIA+ pairs in Osaka. After watching so many people wrestle with conflicting internet advice, I wrote down the clear, current process I give my clients so they can focus on ramen rather than red tape.

**Choose your legal route**

Start by deciding which of four paths fits you. Two non-Japanese partners can register a marriage entirely in Japan by handing in a kon’in todoke at any city or ward office; once the clerk stamps it the marriage is fully recognised under Japanese law. A mixed couple, where one partner is Japanese, uses the same form but must add a freshly issued copy of the Japanese partner’s family register - the koseki tohon - plus photo ID. Same-sex couples cannot obtain a nationwide marriage yet, but more than fifty municipalities issue partnership certificates that unlock rights such as joint tenancy and hospital visitation; most pairs back that up with a legal ceremony in their home country, so the status travels internationally. Many couples skip overseas bureaucracy completely and come to Japan for a purely symbolic celebration - shrine ritual, alpine lake vows or neon rooftop vows - while handling legal paperwork at home.

**The paperwork you carry**

For the fully legal routes each partner needs a passport and photocopy, a Certificate of No Impediment (sometimes called a single-status affidavit) dated within the past three months and, even if the clerk claims it is optional, a birth certificate because requirements change by ward. Every non-Japanese document must be translated into Japanese, yet self-translation is acceptable if each page is signed and dated. Two adult witnesses aged twenty or older must appear with ID; they can be friends, vendors or the friendly traveller you met in the hostel lounge. If one partner is Japanese that fresh koseki tohon is mandatory. Scanning everything to cloud storage before you fly means a lost suitcase cannot wreck the day.

**Filling in the kon’in todoke**

Download the bilingual PDF, print it and fill it out over hotel coffee instead of hunching at the public counter. Names go in block capitals with a katakana version underneath - clerks genuinely appreciate the clarity. Japanese forms list the surname first, so double-check every field before you put pen to paper.

**What happens at the counter**

On filing day, walk to the family-register window marked koseki-ka, hand over passports, translations, witness IDs and the completed form, then wait while the clerk flips through the bundle. If everything is correct, you usually hear the approval stamp within ten to thirty minutes. Certified copies of your Japanese marriage certificate cost only loose change, so buy at least two. Before leaving ask for the Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Marriage because banks, immigration officers and name-change offices care far more about that plain sheet than the decorative parchment you will frame later. By the time you reach the nearest ramen shop you are legally married.

**Making the marriage portable**

Once you have the certificate, translate at least one copy back into English if your home country needs it, then legalise another copy with an apostille at your embassy in Tokyo or via courier while you honeymoon elsewhere. Most embassies stamp documents the same day if you arrive early. When you get home lodge the apostilled certificate with local authorities so the marriage is recognised everywhere from immigration to banks.

**A calm timeline**

Roughly four months before departure order the Certificate of No Impediment and check embassy opening hours so you don’t arrive during a public holiday. Two months out finish translations, download the kon’in todoke and confirm witnesses. One month before the trip print everything twice and ensure nothing has expired. During the week of filing scout photo locations and make sure the city hall is not closing for a festival - Golden Week from 29 April to 5 May catches a lot of couples. On the day itself half an hour at the counter is usually all it takes.

**What it really costs in 2025**

Submitting the kon’in todoke is free. Two certified copies run about seven hundred yen total. An apostille at the UK embassy sits just over seven thousand yen. A traditional Shinto ceremony with kimono rental averages around one hundred thousand yen, while a popular garden photo permit sits near ten thousand yen. Even after adding flights many couples spend less than they would on a registry-office ceremony and pub lunch back home.

**Picking the right season**

Late March to early April brings the iconic cherry blossoms, but tourist spots are crowded and dawn shoots are common. May and early June offer lush greenery, moderate prices and only the first hints of rainy season toward the end of June. Mid-October through late November lights up with red maples and comfortable temperatures, although local couples love autumn too so venues book quickly. December to February means crystal skies, snow-capped Fuji views and very short daylight; hand-warmers and early ceremony slots are essential.

**Field-tested hacks from the job**

Print two sets of every document because public copiers accept only ten-yen coins and jam at the worst moment. Pick up clear bubble umbrellas at Daiso for three hundred yen so drizzle won’t ruin photos. Slip chemical heat packs into kimono obi or suit pockets for winter shoots. Keep a roll of double-sided kimono tape on hand; it fixes everything from rogue lapels to bouquet ribbons.

I keep a printable checklist, translation templates and a shortlist of ceremony spots in my profile if you want extra detail, but the essentials are all here. Happy planning, and feel free to drop questions below - I’ll help where I can.",3,1754541925.0,AusWeddingPlanning,2,1.0,False

that's how I did it folks.

got meds from doctors for my problems, ate, drank coffee, hydrated, vitamins, exercise, and just... did it... and killed it. straight murdered it. 

typing it out makes it seem more real. I pulled it off! and you can too!

now I go across the street and they have a new feel free light up neon sign. I look at it and just smirk. they're trying to get people on the hook. 

I wriggled my way off the hook and swam the fuck away as fast as I could, back to normal life. 

not fishing for compliments 😉

just self-actualization. and maybe inspiration for others. 

quit. today. and in 4 days you can be living a completely different life. I'm walking talking proof it's possible. and it was effortless. I programmed it in my mind what I wanted to do and 123go! forced myself to do it. then I just ran my program. effortless. auto pilot. psycho cybernetics.

Info from the bag

MFD: 27/01/2025  
B.B.: 30/12/2026

Pulling single shots but I am not getting crema and the coffee doesn't have a nice robust taste, it's not sour or bitter but it doesn't have that gusto!

I have the grind size on 4 and grind amount at the 3 o'clock position which is the middle between more and less.

With these settings I get the espresso needle on the middle\\higher end of the espresso range.

If I do more fine then there's too much pressure when pulling the shot and it's slow, if more coarse then the shot is too fast and doesn't taste good.

Today while searching this sub someone mentioned about an internal burr adjustment, most people said that the first thing they do is set it to fine and then they dial in.  Is this overall good practice or just for the true espresso connoisseurs (which I am far from).

  
Maybe just a matter of playing with the settings while at the same time wasting my precious coffee beans :/

I'm just a home coffee maker with a Eureka Mignon + Bambino Plus set up. I make 2 coffees in the morning, one for myself and my wife (I use normal milk and she uses oat milk).

There's nothing wrong at the moment but I do feel like upgrading because:  
\--> the Bambino isn't consistent. The 1st pull vs 2nd pull isn't same. However I don't wait for warmups / manual flush because Bambino doesn't really have a warmup function  
\--> I don't love the cleaning process of the Bambino how it starts flashing / need to go into clean mode and it does some kinda automated process (Not sure if all machines are like that?)

Was thinking is it worth getting a Profitec Go or Profitec Move? Would it increase coffee quality and consistency compared to Bambino+? Only looking at those two because they do look cool but yeah its 4x of a Bambino+ price

People Are Getting PAID Real Money Just for Messing Around on New Apps—No Tech Skills Needed?!,"Hold up—you're telling me people make legit *CASH* just for clicking around on new apps?

Wait. I must have missed something. So you download some new app, poke around, and… boom? Money in your account? 

I genuinely thought these so-called ""Beta Tester Jobs"" were some kind of urban legend or tech myth whispered in Discord DMs.

Turns out, nope. It's real.

And yes—you don’t need ANY tech skills (wild, right?!). People with zero prior experience are literally making money at home testing apps right now. 

Let me break it down (because I'm confused and honestly freaked out over this being so easy):

- **What is beta testing anyway?**
  You’re basically the guinea pig for new apps. You play with features, see if anything is broken, then report what you find. That’s it. That’s the gig.

- **Where do you actually GET these jobs?**
  Here's what made it click for me: I found a listing on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** saying you can sign up in minutes, pick an app, and get started immediately.
  
- **How much can you make?**
  I thought this would be pennies. Yet, I saw people show screenshots earning $20 just for ONE session! Some are stacking quick side cash every single week.

- **Do you HAVE to be techy?**
  Nah. As in—if you can use TikTok or IG, you’re qualified. Apps need people who use their phones like NORMAL humans, not just tech geniuses.

Still processing this, tbh.

So here’s how I threw myself into it (because curiosity got the best of me):

1. Went to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. (Not gonna lie, still felt sketchy about it…)

2. Filled out a quick signup. It asked what devices I used and what types of apps I like. No need for a resume or technical know-how.

3. Chose a game app to test. Played for about 12 minutes. Filled out a short feedback form (“Which button didn’t work? Did it crash?”)

4. Checked two days later and—utterly shocked—*there was money sent to my PayPal*. Not millions, obviously, but enough to order lunch.

But here's the kicker that blew my mind:

- These gigs aren’t just for programmers or app experts.
- A LOT of app developers *prefer* average users—people like us.
- All they want is honest feedback to fix bugs before they go global.

In all honesty, I’m still doubting how little effort this takes.

If you’re bored, think this sounds too good to be true, or want an effortless side hustle to pad your coffee fund, I HIGHLY recommend poking around **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** just to see what pops up.

Don’t wait for the “perfect” time or think experience matters—if you know how to download an app, you’re overqualified.

*Has anyone else actually tried beta tester jobs like this? Did you get cash for your time?*

No exaggeration, this has to be the most low-key way to make money on your own schedule. (I’m telling my roommate. Maybe my mom, too.)

Check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and let me know what happens. I’ll be over here refreshing my PayPal notifications in SHOCK.",1,1754541758.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

1mjqpe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1mjqpe0/doing_well_4_years_since_any_issues/,"Doing well, 4 years since any issues!","Hi all! Been going 4 years strong with no flares or nothin' so I thought I'd come back after a few years to give a periodic encourage me to those of yall in the sub, especially since this sub was such a comfort to me when I was in the throes of my IC issues.

It's been about 4.5 years now, and I really can't say I deal with any of the issues I uses to have during the worst part of my journey, which probably lasted almost year. I was dealing with urgency, urethral irritation, general discomfort in the pelvic area, sharp pain while peeing. Most of the time, I wasn't in outright pain, but it was very much disruptive and my nether regions kinda always felt like they where vaugely burning. I dreaded going to the bathroom, was always wired in discomfort even when I was doing nothing and deathly afraid of any sexual activity, even solo.

 However, I was never diagnosed with IC, since not long into my attempt at getting diagnosed I got better on my own and a lot of my symptoms disapated. Now, I have no diet restrictions, I have way more coffee and spicy than I ever did even before IC. Coffee and eating too many fried/junk/dry foods at once and not staying hydrated might be the only thing that makes my pee feel a little spicy every once and a while. And that'd only last for the 5mins of that bathroom usage. I don't take any medication to manage anything related to that, or go out of my way to do anything to accomedate any fickle urinary business (just keep regular hygiene such as peeing after sexual activity, showering every day), and I haven't had a UTI since then either! I used to take Dmannose to help with preventing UTI's but quit that years ago too. I'm living pretty much as free as I was before I had my IC issues!!

Since I was about 18, I would have occasional UTI's once or twice a year and sometimes I would get antibiotics perscribed through an e-health service so I wasn't tested to see if I actually had an infection, but all the symptoms were there and for a few years the antibiotics would resolve the symptoms so I didn't think anything of it.

Flash forward to 2020 during the pandemic (I was about 21-22), I kept getting these same symptoms that wouldn't clear with antibiotics and would last at first for weeks and then eventually just became almost 24/7, urgency, irritation, retention, pelvic tension, weird white bits floating around in my pee. At this point I struggle to remember a lot of the symptoms I dealt with (which just attests to how long its been since I've had any of them at all), but it was enough to keep me in discomfort at the very least at all times and I was always so stressed and anxious to figure out what was wrong with me. 

I eventually tried as many things as I could at home by myself without medical intervention first, including marshmellow root, aloe vera pills, an EXTREMELY restrictive elimination diet, traditional chinese medicine even. None of which really made much of a difference or helped me pinpoint what might've been causing my issues. I did even try pelvic floor physical therapy, but it didn't help much either. That's when I started trying to go to specialists to get diagnosed, but the lady who I first saw for my issues blew off a lot of my concerns and wanted to do a urethral dilation as the first line of action, and since I didn't have any trouble peeing, I thought it would've done more harm than good. I did seek out a 2nd option, but actually by the time I got to see this 2nd doctor 3mo later, my symptoms had been greatly reduced, and I was well on my way into remission I guess.

I'm sure you guys are curious to what it was that I did to just miraculously rid myself of all those issues and I genuinely wish I had a silver bullet pill to hand yall, but I don't <:""( At the end of the day, looking back, the thing that genuinely pulled me out of all those issues was managing my stress and anxiety levels, and taking care of myself mentally and emotionally. I know this is probably not the answer yall wanna hear, and I'm in no way trying to tell anyone IC is all in your head and you can just meditate your way out of it!! But I do think mine were triggered by stress, and during the lockdown, I had more than enough of that to go around! I guess I was holding so much tension in my pelvis that it just completely threw me out of whack and not being aware of where I held my stress compounded issues worse when I did get UTI's. To this day I still notice whenever I'm stressed, I'll clench up down there. I initially sought out mental&emotional help in therapy and self help resources just bc I realized I was handling the anxiety of dealing with all of the urinary issues so poorly, especially after the elimination diet gave me orthorexia. But that did open the floodgates to me tackling the stress of other things head on too with the methods I was learning to manage the medical anxiety, and within about 3 months, I'd gone from constantly thinking about these issues to virtually symptom free.

Again, this is NOT at all me saying that the very real and debilitating struggles of OC aren't real and all in your head, I'm just telling my story and how I got to the end of it!! I do feel very lucky that stress management and finding support methods for myself mentally has been enough to free me from that awful time and I'm aware I wasn't even dealing with those issues nearly as long as many other people have. But I remember the days when I still religiously lurked on this sub for answers and ANY kind of comfort and consolation that it'll get better soon, and I could have my life back like before those issues ever started. It's true that once people get better, they don't look back much, so there ARE many people like me who've taken back their lives from this blasted diseased and are out there just living their lives! So that's why I'm back to pay my dues and I hope this can give just one person some hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel (maybe even without going through invasive operations or spending thousands on medication or restricting your diet to nothing)!  Take care of yourselves lovlies!! Feel free to ask my anything you're curious about and I'll try my best!",3,1754541343.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False
1mjqoti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1mjqoti/blue_ghost_in_dunsborough/,Blue ghost in Dunsborough,"Hi all.

First time posting. Usually dont talk about this story often, however since discovering this page thought i'd share my experience.

Back in 2001-2002, i stayed as a young teen at a friends holiday home in Dunsborough, Western Australia with my family. Lovely place to holiday at. Holday house was the typical old stilted fishermans shack a few streets from a beach. Had an open plan kitchen and entertaining area (tv, couch, coffe table, dining table), 1 main bedroom internally, plus a sleep-out extension room externally attached capable of having 7 single beds in a row. Great for big families and wasnt always like this as the extension was built a few years prior (so not one of those old houses with history as an orphan houses or local hospitals).

My occurance goes as follows... 
First night on holidays at this place, i didnt want to sleep in the sleep-out area, as it wasnt accessable from the main house so being a new place, my 'stranger danger' senses thought sleeping on a couch inside was better suited safe with my parents no more than 5m away. It's late and everyone goes to bed around midnight. Being the typical kid i was, i took ages to go to sleep and layed on the couch looking towards the kitchen area hoping to fall asleep.

Heres where it gets crazy. I'm looking at the kitchen window (which is tiny used for just natural light) and out of nowhere this blue silhouette of a person climbs through the glass window, through the glass... then proceeds to climb down from the kitchen bench and slowly walks around the kitchen space looking at random things. Best way to explain the visual is a skinny person in a semi-translucent blue morph suit making no noise.

At this point i'm incredibly frozen and unable to move in fear, unable to speak or make any noise. the blue figure proceeds to walk around the house in what felt like 10 minutes looking at pictures, pots, and then makes its way over towards me laying on the couch. still completely frozen, i decided the best way to protect myself was to close my eyes partially and pretend to be asleep as to not draw attention. this seemed to work as the blue figure then spent the next minute squatting at the coffee table directly in front of me combing its hands through stacks of board games - only the board games did not move once. suddenly the blue figure then swivels towards me, proceeding to lean right into my face staring at me about 5cms away. it had no features, but lingered to the point i couldn't handle the looking anymore and shut my eyes completely. by this point my heart was in my mouth and decided to muster all my stength to yell put ""muuuuuuum!!!!"" in an effort to awaken them in the nearby room for help. It must have freaked the blue figure right out, as it then stood tall, and dashed towards the front door in rapid speed gliding across the floor. It then openned the inside door inwards (which was locked) and pushed the security screen door outwards in what seemed like instantly and simultaneously happening with a mighty banging noise.

My mum shortly follows this walking around the bedroom doorway asking ""what the matter was"" and questioned why i was openning the doors this late. i explained what i had witnessed and why the doors openned. My mum tried to reason with me that the wind caused the doors and it was nothing but i could see she was puzzled. Needless to say, i slept (if you could call it sleeping) in their room the remainder of the night.

I returned to this house again years later and never experienced anything like this again.

Blue figures appearing from what i gather seem to be rare, so i often wondered what it was and why this happened. I've never forgotten this moment but also like to think it was just a curious spirit although i've been told the paralysis was it feeding off my energy  but who knows...

Anyways, thats my experience 👍",1,1754541292.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

Anyways, as a very brief intro, I am going to be living part time (Mon-Thur) and working in Gangneung starting next month. I'll be living on the Gangneung Wonju National University (강릉원주대학교) campus. I'm guessing that I will be pretty busy, but not absolutely-no-time-to-relax busy, if you know what I mean.

My wife and I love Gangwon-do and have traveled there 3-4 times a year for the past decade or so. That makes me relatively knowledgeable about the surrounding area, but I've honestly only been to Gangneung a few times. I know a few good coffee shops and breweries (바드나무 is my favorite), but that's about it. I have already marked out a few good running paths and places to chill (Muscle Beach looks fun even if it is probably full of people), but likewise don't know all that much about where to workout. Granted, I guess I can just do the fitness center on campus, run around the track thing, but I enjoy running and walking around my area much more.

To anyone who is familiar with the city or lives there, mind sharing a few spots worth visiting, places to eat or drink, and/or good spots to work out? I will have a car, but am hoping to restrict myself to bicycle while there. However, I'm totally willing to bike long distances. Basically, anything within the city limits is fair game.

I am planning my graduation party which is happening pretty soon, but I'm in a bit of a tough position since I will be travelling until the day before the party and working with a tight budget (trying to keep food costs under $100). I will only have one day to prep all of the food and I'm really struggling to come up with a good menu.

There will be around 20-25 guests, and most everyone attending are Asian-American so I would like to have some traditional items. The theme of the party is pink and white, so plus points if the items fit the aesthetics!

This is the preliminary menu I came up with:

**Appetizers**

* Pre-marinated or frozen wings
* Hawaiian bread sliders
* Costco salad
* Chips & guac/salsa/hummus
* Shingara

**Entree (No pork and vegetarian options)**

* Make your own bibimbap station
* Pasta + garlic bread

**Dessert**

* Cake
* Brownies
* Fruits
* Falooda

**Drinks (No Alcohol)**

* Matcha and iced coffee stand
* Fruit punch
* Water

My biggest worry is what to serve as the main. I want to do something fun and that everyone would enjoy, but I won't have time to make a bunch of different banchan's for the bibimbap and buying them from H-mart or an equivalent store would be too expensive. I was also considering a make your own taco bowl or nachos station as well, but not a lot of us enjoy taco bowls. I though of a DIY pasta station as well but I'm worried guests may find it lackluster.

I’m in my 3rd year in university studying business classes at the local community college. For background, I am a child of immigrants and we did not have enough money to send me to college. Plus, I am afraid that Trump will cut funding, so I’m not taking any loans. Figure I’ll just work slow to get a degree.

I’m taking classes part time and to pay for my schooling and books, I work at a little restaurant. It is me, my coworker, and boss Sigmund. We normally close at 8 pm and sometimes have live music and light bites.


It is at 7:45 when an older lady and her equally old husband come in. They are dressed really nice in old money style, if that makes sense. They ask to see the menu and sit down. For reference, the hours are in bold on the front and it says the restaurant closes at 8.

I look at Sigmund and he nods to serve them. They order the elaborate sandwich and pasta dishes, so we are scrambling to assemble them in time. I don’t know why Sigmund didn’t tell them we are closing.

The boomers get the food and they take their time. I politely tell them we are closing but they still sit there. This forces us to stay open until after 8:30. 

I tried to give them the hint but they wouldn’t take it so I start cleaning up. The boomer lady starts yelling that I am disturbing their meal. Lady, you’re the only two in here and we are closing. Didn’t want to say that so I bit my tongue.

I collect their plates and say I am a student and have to have them leave because I have exams tomorrow. The man calls me an idiot and said it figured I am working at a low key joint because i am clearly not bright enough for a real job. They get up and leave.

The sad part is they didn’t tip me at all and left a mess. Sigmund apologized to me and told me I could have a free meal the next day.
