I thought he was interested during the date. He was talking about how he wanted me to teach him to play an instrument. After coffee we went for a walk and he offered me his jacket and complimented my eyes. As we were hugging goodbye he kissed my head. But I didn’t hear anything from him by today. I messaged him on the app saying thanks for a great time and he replied “Likewise! It was nice spending time with you :)” 

That reads as disinterested to me because he hasn’t asked for my number or mentioned a second date.

I guess to begin with, l'd love to meet you and cuddle. BUT we both are random people on the internet. So let's take our time to get to know one another. Im not saying that we need to wait months on end but like a week or so. Or until you are comfortable with meeting.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie. There is probably more to that list but I just can't think of everything.

And to end this I hope you have a good day!",1,1762735861.0,cuddlebuddies,1,1.0,False

**Disclaimer 2:** I’m not that used to reddit/to this subreddit so if I'm not allowed to post this here feel free to delete it :)

Hello everyone, thanks for reading my post. It is definitely going to be a long one so feel free to just skip to the parts you are interested in.

The goal of this post is to inform and express my experience as someone who studied for 18 months in a language school (genkijacs) in Japan as a complete beginner, since I couldn’t find a lot of information online/mixed reviews that made me hesitate on what to do.  
I hope that you can find some useful information here that can help you out, whether it is a push if you are hesitating to go to Japan as student or start the idea of it.  
If you are worried because you dont know any Japanese, let me stop you really quick and tell you not to worry at all :)

It takes quite a lot of planning and time to move to Japan so let's start !

1. **FUKUOKA:**

If you have never heard of it, Fukuoka is the capital of Fukuoka Prefecture and the largest city on the island of Kyushu.  
That said, it is a very cozy city and definitely doesn't have the crowded atmosphere of cities like Tokyo. You also won't find almost any foreigner on the streets except for a few chinese, koreans and philippines in crowded areas.

* **PROS:**

It has everything that you need and more to make a life for mid/long term, that includes good transportation, hospitals, departments, lots of shops, restaurants, entertainment, night life.

The food is absolutely delicious, better than a lot of what I tried in other bigger cities.

***People***

A very friendly environment, I have never felt out of place or avoided by the locals. In fact, after time passed and I became able to have conversations, making friends wasn’t as difficult as you can read on the internet sometimes. You just need to go out to friendly environment places like bars/izakayas, etc. Once you make a friend, you will be able to make friends with that new friend’s friends (sorry i know is difficult to understand haha) and from that point on it is a snowball. There are also places for foreigners and language exchange you could try.

***English***

99% of the people you are going to find don't speak English, that even includes immigration office/ward office/physical mail and letters you will receive.

Nothing will be written in our alphabet except stuff like train station names, bus stop names, etc.

I’m putting this in ***pros*** because from my point of view, as a language student I want to immerse myself in the language, and I know just because of comfort that if I had the option of speaking in English I would take it, so not having it was rough at first but extremely helpful long term.

***Nightlife***

It's very fun, very safe and if you go to Japan with a strong foreign currency, it's quite cheap. Remember you will also have foreign friends from your language school so dont private yourself because you dont know much japanese.  
Also if you decide to go to Fukuoka, most of the places are located in Tenjin, which is usually not that far from where people should be staying, so even if you stay until quite late you can take a taxi (there are a lot, no even need for apps like Uber but can always use them) or just walk 20min home.

***Insurance***

Japan basically makes you join their insurance system that you will have to pay per month (you can pay it all at once or every 3 months etc, just explaining that for example a month is around 1600 yen). This system covers you around 70% of your medical bills.  
As far as I know, price scales per person depending on how much you earn per year but since you are a student it is always the same. If I remember correctly, it was around 1600 yen per month.

* **CONS:**

***Buses***  Usually they won't be on the scheduled time at your bus stop by a few minutes, depending on rain or snow they might take even longer and sometimes even get late to where you want to go by 10-20 minutes. Not a big deal if you have different buses you can take, but if you live in an area that could only take a specific one like me, then it can be a struggle. Remember japanese people are usually on time so go out a bit earlier.  **Note:** Subways are usually on time, so don't worry about it.

***Ward office***  This is a place that you will have to go quite a few times if you go to study with a visa. Especially the first week as you need to go do some errands there. I don’t remember exactly what, but it was something like registering your address,  registering for the insurance and something tax related if I remember correctly (I don't know how the last one works since as a student, you can't work enough hours to make enough money to pay taxes)  The negative point of this is that no one speaks English there (at least every time I went), the only reason I managed to go through all that is because I was accompanied by a host family member who always helps the students and knows what to do.

***Letters***

I received quite a few during my 18 months stay, and every letter you will be receiving is in Japanese. Now, I understand we indeed are in Japan. However, I would have thought we could have some English translated options for the important ones like those coming from the ward office, as they are aware you are an international student. Then again, don’t worry much about them because every school is aware of this and will help you sort everything, I just wanted to point out that is a bit inconvenient.

**2. VISA:**

On this point I can only talk about my experience with the student visa, as it is the one I used.

First of all, there might be mixed reviews depending on people’s experience, even within the student body there are some who consider it a breeze while others a nightmare.

The process itself is quite long, and the school is the one who will do most of the job for you (they actually have to do it).

In order to apply for a student visa there is one requirement that takes around 2 to 3 months to receive from the Japanese government. This is called **Certificate of Eligibility or CoE**. Schools will submit this in Japan for you, but in order to do that they will ask you for a lot of stuff like information, school graduation certificates, scans, etc. This process itself took me around 2 to 3 months due to the time difference between Japan and my home country. So in total it is around 5 months from the starting point until the school receives it.

Once the school receives this CoE, you will have to pay them for the studying time (in my case 18 months worth) and that's when they will send it to you, and then you can go to the Japanese embassy/consulate in your country and request the visa.

I’m going to put the current requirements here according to google, just note that this might change or will vary.

**Before applying for the visa**

1. **Get accepted to a school in Japan:** Your school will help you with the application for the Certificate of Eligibility (COE).
2. **Secure a COE:** This is a crucial step, as it proves you meet the conditions for landing in Japan and significantly speeds up the visa process. To apply, you'll need to provide the school with documents like:
   * Passport copy (photo page and any previous Japan entry/exit stamps)
   * Passport-style photos
   * Academic documents (diplomas, transcripts)
   * Financial proof (bank statements, sponsor's income/employment certificates) showing you can support your tuition and living expenses
   * Proof of Japanese language ability (if applicable)
3. **Gather documents for the visa application**\*\*:\*\* After your school receives your COE, you can apply for the visa. You will need your original COE and the following documents:
   * Valid passport
   * Visa application form
   * Passport-sized photos 

**Final visa application**

* Submit the COE, passport, application form, and photos to your local Japanese embassy or consulate.
* Any documents not in Japanese or English will need to be translated.
* The COE does not guarantee a visa, but it does expedite the application process. 

On top of all this, I had to do a 800 word essay about why I wanted to study in Japan. This being related to the professional fields and how you will be using this knowledge in your future.  
However, a lot of students didn't do this step for some reason. So I'm not sure if this was a lottery or was the school who made me do it and used the CoE as an excuse.

I also had to do a Japanese test that I could repeat endlessly until I got 80% of the questions correct. I want to point out I was a complete beginner, so I don't see a point either. And again, most of the people in my school never took said test so I have no idea.

**Summary:** A lot of waiting time, a lot of sending but not really stressful.

***Residence card***

There is a lot of mixed info about where to get it. Before I went there, according to the internet you could only receive it at the airport of a big city when entering Japan in the immigration part.  
Which is the main reason I decided to travel there and land in Tokyo, but according to my school friends that landed directly in Fukuoka, they also received them instantly instead of having to wait a week to receive them via Mail.  
So, I don't know if it changed recently before I went there or what happened but either way don’t worry much about it. Just make sure to carry it everywhere while you are in Japan in your wallet, otherwise if you get stopped and don't have it with you, you can get fined.

**3. LANGUAGE SCHOOL: GENKIJACS FUKUOKA**

This is the language school I picked at the end after checking a few, and the main reason for this was that 90%+ of the student body are people from Europe, North and South America. I didn’t want the pressure of feeling I would be behind Kanji wise if students were people from China, Korea, etc.  
Also I felt like I would be more used and it would be easier to make friends with Europeans and North/South American people.

It also has a campus in Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya and Okinawa. However, only the ones in Fukuoka and Nagoya are able to offer long term visas, so if you want to come for a short term you can go to the others, although they usually are packed and might have to wait to make a reservation.

Unlike my language school when I went to study english, in this school you won't have separated classes exclusively for Listening, Reading and Writing, Speaking etc.

What im trying to say is, some people are better at speaking but are not as good when it comes to listening, so you would get placed for example: grammar lvl 2, speaking lvl 3, listening lvl 1, etc.

But in genkijacs, you are always with the same classmates during the whole year, studying the same level despite your level differences in speaking, reading etc.

***School requirements outside the visa ones***

Do an interview with the school (it can be in english) so they know your japanese level and what class to place you in.  
You still need to do this despite when applying marking the complete beginner option.

Go to Japan **knowing** how to write and read Hiragana and Katakana. Even on the orientation day they will give you a test about this, so make sure you practice beforehand!  
Learning this does not take long although it definitely looks intimidating at first but believe me when I say you will get used to this very quickly.

**Note:** Kanjis are not needed/required

***Leveling System***

Every 6 months you will be finishing  a grammar book, meaning you will be leveling up with your classmates.

**Beginners 1:** 2 trimesters of 3 months each = 6 months  
**Beginners 2:** 2 trimesters of 3 months each = 6 months

However, if you know enough Japanese to not start with the very basics but not enough to be placed on beginners 2, they will place you in a class from beginners 1 that already started 3 months ago.

In my case I started in beginners 1 from scratch and went for 18 months, so I finished Intermediate 1.

***Books:***

As for the moment I finished in 2025, the school uses the following books.

**Beginners 1:** Minna no nihongo 1 books set  
**Beginners 2:** Minna no nihongo 2 books set  
**Intermediate 1:** Quartet 1, Workbook, Try N3, a Folder with homeworks and useful stuff inside.

**Note:** Before finishing your school year, you can ask in the reception for the following books set or just a specific one, but you have to pay for them (they do give you discounts)

***Tests***

The dynamic on beginners 1 and 2 is the same, you have a test day every month and half, meaning every trimester you will have 2 test days that includes: Vocabulary test, Grammar test (this is the long one), and an Interview.

They are not that hard and don't ask things outside of what you have learned so as long as you go to class you are fine.

When it comes to intermediate things change: You only have a test day, and it is the whole day of the last day of the trimester. It includes: Kanji test, Reading and Writing test, Vocabulary test, Grammar test, Listening test and an Interview.

Again, outside kanjis because you have no option but to learn them, they are not that hard.

You need a 70% grade in order to pass them, if you don't score that you need to re-take whatever you failed.

***Teachers***

This depends on each's liking and what teachers you have but overall I felt pretty lucky, most of them were such sweet people always willing to help and get close to you.

I'm not trying to sell my school by saying only positive points, there also were some that I felt annoying and others incredibly boring but I would say 85% of them were awesome.

However, despite liking them or not, absolutely all of them are professionals when it comes to teaching abilities, especially the ones in Intermediate.

***Classmates***

Again, I felt pretty blessed with them. We were a pretty heterogeneous group, with people from all over the world: Germany, America, England, Netherlands, Swiss, Brasil, etc. We had an incredibly atmosphere, always joking and hanging out after class/weekends.

I did see a class with 6 out of 8 people from the United States for example, so it’s a roulette whether you get international class or people from the same country.

***Classes and Schedules:***

There are 3 blocks of schedules and you will be placed in one of them for a trimester

**Block 1:** 9:30 to 13:10

**Block 2:** 11:30 to 13:10 - lunch break - 14:10 to 15:50 (I’m not 100% sure about this one)

**Block 3:** 14:10 to 17:45

***1- Beginner classes:***

The classes are usually quite interactive, most of the time is grammar learning and practice. Once you finish the grammar point usually you move to the reading, writing and listening points. You also have Kanji classes on a certain day of the week, which allow me to tell you: They are lowkey useless, all you see is a kanji on the board and you write it 3 times and forget about them because you never have a kanji test and most of the text books have the furigana (means hiragana on top of the kanji).

***2-*** ***Intermediate classes:***

This is when the real deal starts, books don't really have the furigana on top of the kanjis anymore unless it is something like a name or random stuff.  
On beginners you would see a grammar point for 2 or 3 days, here you see 3 per block when it comes to the TRY N3 book (**note:** this book doesn't go to the school test but prepares you for the JLPT). When we use QUARTET books it is slower.

There is a lot more of speaking with your classmates and teachers, there are roleplays, more presentations, etc.

When I looked on the internet before going to Japan, a lot of people complained about how Intermediate is quite useless since it is a lot of self study.  
However, I don't particularly agree on everything and in fact I prefer these classes over the beginners ones. But it does require you to at least read the vocabulary a few times.

I felt these classes were way more chill, there was more speaking with the teachers even about trivial things, and barely any homework compared to the 2 daily front and back pages from beginners.

***School Events***

I was honestly surprised by the quality of the events, from language exchange with Japanese people to visiting another prefecture for a whole day with a tour plan already made up for you to enjoy with the school and schoolmates.

***Accommodations***

I wasn’t sure if to put this one here or not but lets go ahead.

The school gives you the option to arrange the accommodation for you and there are 3 options as far as I know:

**Dormitory (cheapest)**  
**Private apartment (quite expensive)**  
**Homestay (most expensive)**

The one I picked was a homestay and even though I was supposed to stay only for  3 months I ended up staying for the whole time.

I already had a homestay experience in the past and let me tell you, if you are willing to sacrifice a little tiny bit of your privacy, you will always have someone to count with, to have fun with, to introduce you to the culture and places you would have never imagined and your japanese level with the time will skyrocket compared to people on dormitories. I even got invited to their daughter’s wedding after only 3 months there !

I want to point out that even though it is the most expensive option on paper, it really wasn't on the long term. The homestay includes breakfast and dinner for the whole year or year and half, and you don't pay for services like wi-fi either. They even gave me the money back (800 yen) every time I had dinner outside with friends, I didn’t even want to accept it but they were so adamant that I just took the money, saved it slowly and invited them to a meal with that.

I also had roommates that came to the house so it was a lot of fun. Initially I couldn't speak any japanese so the roommate at the moment helped me out and then I did the same with the ones that came later.

***School building***

If you've ever been to Japan, you can already have an image of this. It is a non very spacious 6 floors building, with around 3 to 4 classrooms per floor.  
The classrooms, however, are not that small so don't worry about it. The hallways and stairs though, those definitely could use more space but nothing you won’t get used to.

Restrooms, there is one per floor. Meaning that for example, women restrooms are on the 2nd floor, while the men's one is on the 3rd floor and so on.  
They are usually clean and with the toilet slippers, but there are around 2 urinals and 2 toilets (some floors only 1 toilet and not an urinal). During the break time, it gets quite crowded and I had to wait for people to finish, sometimes I didn't even get the chance to go in before the 5 min break was over.

The school offers you slippers for you to use once you enter, just remove your shoes on the genkan (place to remove your shoes that almost every house has in Japan) and leave them on the shoes shelf and take a pair of slippers.  
I want to point out that these are probably older than the school itself lmao, so what most people do is to buy their own pair.

The lounge is quite spacious, it has some tables for you to hang with your friends, study, read the manga/books from the shelves, play guitar, etc.  
It also offers you a mini coffee machine for people to use for 100 yen (no one is there asking for the money, so do it yourself)

Outside there is a vending machine, so if you want something to drink there is that.  
Also you have a lot of Konbinis (convenience stores) nearby to buy whatever you want on the break or before/after classes. Just like that, there are also a couple of food trucks 2 min walking from school that change daily.

***JLPT/J-TEST (long term visas only)***

I'm not sure if this falls into the school requirements or the visa one, but you do have to take either of these before your course finishes. Being the N4 (JLPT) or E-D (J-TEST) the lowest test level.

You can find examples of these tests online so I won't go very deep into these, but I do think the JLPT is easier than the J-TEST, since there is no written part on the JLPT. I could be wrong about this, and it also depends on each person's liking but that's just my opinion.

***School staff***

At the reception you can find the staff, all of them have a very advanced English level so no need to worry about not knowing Japanese.

Each of them have different roles (payments, visas, accommodations, etc). But all of them can help you with trivial things like reading letters, getting a part time job, getting wifi for your place, phone number, opening bank accounts, etc.

Always with a smile on their face, so make sure you also re-pay their kindness with another smile :)

***Holidays***

In a year you will have 3 different long holidays, depending when you start

***Summer holidays:*** 4 weeks  
***Autumn holidays:*** 1 or 2 weeks  
***Winter holidays:*** 2 weeks  
***Spring holidays:*** 3 weeks

**Note:** You also have golden week somewhere between April and May

***Part time job***

Before explaining this aspect, I want to point out that I did not work there as a part timer but I have a lot of friends that did.

**IMPORTANT:** To be able to work a part time job, you need to have the permit on the residence card. I don't remember exactly how you get this done but I believe you need to mark the option one of the documents you hand in for the visa or the immigration.

Here is what google says about this:

**Work hours and permits**

* During school terms: Up to 28 hours per week.
* During long holidays: Up to 40 hours per week, such as summer, winter, and spring breaks.
* Permit required: You must apply for and receive permission from the Immigration Bureau to work part-time. This can be done upon arrival at the airport or at an immigration office later.

**Note:** the school only allows you to work for 20h instead of 28h. The reason for this is because even though the above says per week, it **DOES NOT** take the week from sunday to sunday **but 28h in a period of 7 days**. This is very tricky to keep track of, so to avoid surpassing this limit and getting in a problem with immigration, the school reduces the amount of hours.

You probably need a bit of Japanese to get hired, unless it is a restaurant with a theme of your own language (like Spanish speaking people working in a Mexican restaurant), English teacher, etc

I think the minimum wage in Fukuoka is around 1.100 Yen so around $7 American Dollars.

**4. RECOMMENDATIONS:**

***Yatai***

These are little food carts that are on the street at night until quite late, people go to these after drinking or having nightlife. You can eat Ramen, Oden, drink alcohol, etc.  
Definitely an experience you want to have.

***Karaoke***

I was never a fan of karaoke before, I don't really enjoy singing. But there is something about Japanese karaoke that just changes it completely. You have some instruments to make some noise, can drink and eat inside and have a lot of anime and english songs for you to blast the microphone. If you have Japanese friends, absolutely go with them, because they know how to have a party in such a small room.

***Izakayas***

If you are not familiar, these are some sort of Japanese pubs. There are various types but usually are quite cheap.  
Depending on how long you are staying and how many people, you can either check the combos of drinks with food or straight have Nomihoudai (all you can drink for 1:30h or whatever they offer)

***Daiso***

These are 100 Yen shops that have a lot of stuff. From snacks, to nails, socks, toys, slippers, etc. Whatever you need that doesn't require an amazing quality, go there.

***Festivals and Events***

Japan has a lot of cultural and entertainment events, from people running carrying a big statue to fireworks. These are unique experiences that if you have ever seen in anime, in real life they are 100% better.

***Dating Apps***

Debated whether to write this or not but lets be honest, some of you might be interested in this aspect.  
Straight in, don't use Tinder especially in smaller cities. Not many people speak English and there are a lot of scammers/bots. Also a lot of people just won’t show their face but Purikura, food, nails, etc pictures.

Instead try Bumble, even in small cities people who create a profile there are able to communicate in English and it has 2 verification steps for the profiles, one that shows you if the person’s face matches the one in their pictures (this app makes you have a picture showing your face) and other if they verified via an ID and photo.

***Onsen/Thermal Water***

Pretty self-explanatory, if you are interested in Japan you know what those are. They are not expensive at all so treat yourself.  
Some of them don't allow people with tattoos, even if they are covered but in my experience those were only the very traditional ones.  
Just make sure to carry your own towels so you don't have to rent them. Also the culture there is to be completely naked, so if you can’t handle that you will have to rent a private Onsen for a bigger price.

***School card***

Use the school card that you will be receiving at school for extra discounts in some place like Cinemas, Museums, etc

***Used Stuff***

If you want to save some money when it comes to transportation/adding furniture to your apartment, you can buy second hand stuff like bicycles, chairs, etc and then resell it once you are done with your study period. Some other students that are going to return soon  are probably looking to get rid off their stuff that can't take home, so surely you can get a good deal or even take some free stuff.

**5. SUMMARY**

***Fukuoka:*** **9/10**

It is a very cozy city, friendly people, good entertainment, and festivals.

***Visa process***\*\*: 6/10\*\*

Long process, lots of documentation, unnecessary requirements like a Japanese test despite being a complete beginner. However, once everything is submitted all you need to do is wait.  
However, if you are interested in short term courses depending on your country you wont be needing a visa.

***Japanese language school/GenkiJACS:*** **8.5/10**

Good learning system, professional friendly teachers, cozy building with everything you need nearby.

***Host family:*** **10/10**

Every comment I can make about my experience is super positive, I cannot think of a single negative thing. Such lovely and caring people.

***Overall Experience:*** **9.5/10**

If I had the chance to go back in time and do it all over again,I wouldn't think twice. I'm super grateful to everyone I met and had a lot of fun. Felt like escaping the reality I live on

Some days sparkle, others stumble, but there’s always something to be grateful for if you look closely enough. A kind word, a warm cup of coffee, a small victory that no one else sees. All tiny reminders that joy doesn’t need to shout; it simply glows quietly when you let it. ☕🌞

I’ve learned that keeping a grateful heart is a bit like tending a secret garden: the more you water it with positivity, the more beautifully it blooms. 🌿 Even on cloudy days, gratitude turns the drizzle into diamonds.

1oszy9v,https://i.redd.it/f7yz8rgstb0g1.jpeg,"A very, very, very long Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Review + Empty! ☕️🖤 🖊️","According to the Ulta, Black Opium Le Parfum has notes of green mandarin, cinnamon, pear, jasmine sambac, solar notes, orange blossom, Madagascar vanilla, bourbon vanilla, vanilla absolute, coffee, patchouli, and vanilla orchid.

Upon first application, the Black Opium DNA was immediately recognizable although Le Parfum is very different from the OG. The fruity notes were not detectable to me on my first wear, and never have been. I also have never picked up the orange blossom. It’s interesting because the coffee in Le Parfum is sweeter and more vanilla heavy than the original Black Opium, yet it packs a bitterness that the original doesn’t. On my first wear, I was very intrigued by it, and that bitterness grew to be on of my favorite things about Le Parfum. It was bitter without veering into scorched, burnt coffee territory as coffee notes can so easily do in fragrance. 

I never picked up patchouli from the original Black Opium but Le Parfum was a patchouli bomb for the longest. It’s an earthy, grungy, loud patchouli - but for some reason, I didn’t dislike it. With time, I grew to adore it (loud patchouli notes were new to me at the time). It reminds me of the patchouli in Betsey Johnson Pretty n Punk which is also earthy, grungy and loud. Honestly akin to Pretty n Punk, on the first few wears, I could see Le Parfum being headache inducing for me if I were to apply more than one spritz. This proved to not be an issue later down the line. With time, the vanilla emerged more and the patchouli and vanilla became far more balanced. Le Parfum actually became a fragrance that I would apply moderately to heavily (heavy applications were saved for evenings in - heavily being about six sprays). 

Five minutes into my first few wears, I could detect some jasmine but it was in the background, and it was hazy. As quickly as the jasmine came, it was gone and the patchouli pulls the coffee alongside it in the spotlight. After the first two months or so of wear, I stopped being able to detect the jasmine at all - even for a moment. The bitterness of the coffee largely dissipates after the first few hours, making the vanilla sweetness seem stronger.

Le Parfum has always made me think of drinking a sweet vanilla latte right next to an incense holder that contains several sticks of lit, earthy patchouli incense. The door is closed and the smoke billows and creates a hazy blanket over the room. You sip your latte and the scents of sweet vanilla coffee intermingles with the patchouli, but the scent of the earthy, now smoky patchouli dominates. It also makes me think fondly back to my favorite coffee shop in the Asian town plaza near my old home, sipping affogato and drawing in my sketch pad. 

On my very first wear, I stopped paying attention to the development of the fragrance until nearly three hours later. At that point, the fragrance was a delicious intimate sweet coffee scent that reminds me of Vietnamese coffee (the one that’s made with condensed milk!) with a kiss of creamy patchouli (the patchouli is no longer incense-y or smoky at this point) and a hint of woodiness (although there are no woody notes listed). 

Le Parfum has continued performing in a similar manner as far as how the scent develops over time. However, in the heat, it projects for longer than three hours. I would say it projects for about six hours. Depending on how much I apply, I’d say it can project quite strongly but I’d classify the projection as moderate overall. As far as longevity, I did not note it back when I lived in a cold climate but I’d say around seven hours. In the hot climate that I live in now, the longevity is the same. 

On clothes, however, Le Parfum lasts for ages - and I do mean ages! When I lived in my old home before my move to the surface of the sun, I found a shirt I had worn a few months ago in the depths of my closet. It STILL smelled like Le Parfum all that time later. 

For context, it was underneath a cascade of purses. My purse hanger had broke and I could not be bothered to pick up the purses until a few months had gone by (I know, I know, how lazy). Once I finally picked up the purses, I found that shirt. I could only smell it when I held the shirt to my nose, and I had sprayed quite heavily when I had originally worn it (those six sprays I mentioned before), but still. I think that’s something to be behold! 

To be frank, in the first fifty-nine minutes of my first time wearing Le Parfum I was dissatisfied. Despite it being an interesting, grungy, cozy fragrance with a sensual mystique, I hadn’t expected nor wanted such a patchouli-heavy perfume. 

The way the patchouli blended with the delicious, creamy vanilla in deep dry down completely changed my mind. I also quickly grew to adore the very prominent patchouli note! Black Opium Le Parfum wasn’t what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised. It is feminine mystique in a bottle to me, and has grown to be one of most beloved fragrances. So much so that I have another travel spray on its way to me now!",1,1762735546.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

By [Teo van den Broeke](https://www.esquire.com/uk/author/9743/teo-van-den-broeke/)Published: 09 November 2025

It's hard to imagine Jonathan Bailey ever running low on energy. Hollywood's hottest Duracell Bunny arrives at Mayfair’s Connaught Hotel in a flash of white teeth, bright eyes and positive vibes.

Wearing a cap and a logo tee, Bailey is fresh off the Eurostar from Paris, where he attended his pal Jonathan Anderson’s womenswear debut for Dior. “The energy is wild, isn’t it?” he exudes. For the occasion, Bailey sported a pair of wraparound sunglasses and a quarter-zip sweater from the French fashion giant. “In a brilliant way. You can feel a palpable tension. Presumably because it’s a huge moment of change.”

He looks happy and tanned, which is to be expected, given that he’s currently parked at the white-hot centre of the cinematic firmament.

*Wicked: For Good*, in which Bailey plays the effervescent, occasionally shirtless Prince Fiyero, hits cinemas this week. If it lands anywhere near the success of the franchise’s first instalment — which topped the 2024 box office, taking home $756 million (£565 million) — Bailey’s star will only continue its steep, sparkly ascent.

Earlier this year, he starred opposite Scarlett Johansson in *Jurassic World Rebirth*, and he’s also hard at work expanding the Shameless Fund — a charitable initiative he launched in 2024. The mission: “To raise money through global brand partnerships and support LGBTQ+ individuals around the world in living openly, loving freely and thriving without fear or shame.”

So yes, Jonathan Bailey is handsome, stylish and wildly successful, but he’s also a pretty good dude. And right now, he’s folding himself into a too-formal hotel boardroom chair, fidgeting as he sips his coffee, ready to talk.

**Teo van den Broeke:** First things first: let’s talk about your retirement.

**Jonathan Bailey:** Are we speaking with a twinkle?

**TVDB:** Always…

**JB:** I was at the end of Richard II and I was going on the Jurassic press tour and there were two films I could have gone on to do. The Shameless Fund was bubbling away, and then at the beginning of the year, when I was doing the play,

I had the opportunity to start workshopping \[the fund\] with Sarah Jenkins, \[former\] COO of Saatchi & Saatchi. We were looking to see how we could scale up, and it felt like a really important time to get it right. I stepped away from doing those two films. I then did an interview with a magazine when I was cycling between Rome and Pisa on the way to a friend’s wedding, and the internet kept cutting out. As a result, there was an unfortunate misquote that said I’d stopped acting for a bit.

**TVDB:** So, you didn’t say it?

**JB:** My intention was to say, “Next year I’ll be back,” but yeah, the ripple effect was extraordinary. My sister, who I’m close to and lives in Australia, called me and said, “Wow, is everything OK? You’ve given up?” By Monday, the headlines were “Jonathan Bailey has quit acting”. I learnt at that moment that you can’t control it.

**TVDB:** Do you feel at peace with that?

**JB:** Integrity is so precious, isn’t it? The only thing you have control over is how you show up in the world. How you show up to work and how you show up for your friends and family. And if there’s alignment between what you say and how you act, there’s a kind of throbbing sense of integrity.

**TVDB:** So you have stopped acting, but not for very long?

**JB:** Well yeah. I mean as it stands at the moment, I’ll definitely be back to work next year. I’m not taking the whole of 2026 off.

**TVDB:** But you won’t be putting anything out during 2026?

**JB:** Correct. Currently the absolute focus is the Shameless Fund.

**TVDB:** How is that going?

**JB:** I had to do my first presentation this week. I spoke for 30 minutes to the WACL \[Women in Advertising and Communications, Leadership\]. It was such an inspiring room. It felt extraordinary talking about something that has existed in my head and something that was born out of an unease and discomfort. It’s exposing. The aim is to scale it up, and it’s exciting. One of the metrics of success is the money we raise, but another metric is joy and activation.

**TVDB:** Explain “activation”.

**JB:** Activation is a word I learnt too late in life. There are times when you can feel overwhelmed or despondent, and you feel grief about the state of the world. But activation is when you’re taken out of a cycle of thought. It can happen in conversations with friends, or it can happen with a stranger. It’s a call to arms of sorts.

When it comes to showing up in a way that supports the LGBTQIA+ global community, it’s about being creative in a time when the bumpers have been put up. People currently feel straitjacketed about how they tell stories and engage with potential customers and communities in a time when community is being pulled apart at the sinews. It’s about thinking of ways to bring people back together.

**TVDB:** Was the idea for Shameless the result of having felt shame?

**JB:** I think we all feel shame. Anyone who’s ever felt any sort of aggression or corrective judgement. That’s part of the human experience. But of course, there is this huge triangle of privilege within it. And I’m fully aware that I’m right at the top of that. I’m also a massive benefactor of everyone who came before me. If, in the short time that I’m here, I can be a benefactor of the plight and the fight of a community that created a world in which I can play a Winkie prince…

**TVDB:** Then that’s a good thing! Winkie prince is great.

**JB:** I’m obsessed with Winkie prince. I reached out to Donatella Versace and she put it on a bomber jacket for me. There should be a whole brand called Winkie Prince.

**TVDB:** It sounds like a JW Anderson capsule. But back to shame…

**JB:** Shame is everywhere. But art is shame, isn’t it? Because there’s a need to interpret things if you feel pain.

**TVDB:** I think there’s also something about gay men and women. We need to prove ourselves constantly: be bigger, and better, and more sparkly. I think that shapes us.

**JB:** I think that’s right. I also think the truth about shame is that it can be completely debilitating, painful and dispiriting, and it can be really dangerous. It can literally be a matter of life and death. But also — depending on the privilege of where and how you live — it has this ability to fine-tune empathy and provide the ability to see multiple points of view, because you’re constantly having to appraise what other people are perceiving and how they’re acting. But if you’ve felt shame in your life, my God, do you feel joy. The opposite of shame is freedom, right? For me, joy is being in the right place, with the right people, and getting to a place where you feel like, “Yes, I’m meant to be here.” Or actually, “I feel really awkward, I’m going to go.” Getting to that point feels good.

**TVDB:** Did you have to work to get to that point?

**JB:** In my 20s I was hard on myself because I was like, “Why am I finding walking into this room full of people really uncomfortable?” But I’ve learnt to be like, “Yeah, it’s just not for me.” And that’s fine. If not going into that room means I’m not going to work or whatever that’s fine.

**TVDB:** Really? I imagine because you have such a warm persona…

**JB:** That I must be an ice queen inside?

**TVDB:** No, but Scarlett Johansson called you twinkly — and you are twinkly. Is that something you put out into the world to protect yourself?

**JB:** No. If anything I’m more like I was when I was five or six now. We’re all corrupted by stories we’re given of the world. And it’s a lot of narrative. But then you realise that that’s just what the human experience is.

**TVDB:** What’s the story that’s corrupted you?

**JB:** I’m trying to think of a light, “actor doing a profile” friendly way to say it.

**TVDB:** Come on…

**JB:** If you don’t go to drama school, you can’t do Shakespeare. Or, if you do ballet, it’s linked to your sexuality. It’s like an indicator, a signifier of something. Or boys should only play rugby or football. Or if you can’t focus in school, you’re thick.

**TVDB:** You’re clearly an open person. Do you feel gagged by your position?

**JB:** I feel like I’m very private, but I’m not secretive.

**TVDB:** What’s the difference?

**JB:** There’s nothing that I’m like, “I’m not going to tell Teo that.” But I want to be emotionally calm when talking about things in any capacity that might be… You know, there are private ways you feel about the world and certain issues. And it’s like when you go to the pub or a dinner party and you find yourself saying something you haven’t even maybe voiced to yourself, and you can leave thinking, “God, actually, what did I say?” I just don’t want to find myself in that environment if I can avoid it.

**TVDB:** Do you feel like your acting work is an outlet for any feelings of shame you’ve experienced?

**JB:** Yes.

**TVDB:** And does it influence the roles you choose?

**JB:** Yes. I can’t speak about the process of choosing work other than it feels like expanding memory foam. When I read a script and I respond to a character, it’s a watertight experience for me because it feels like I’m drunk. It’s the same feeling as being giddy or listening to an amazing song, or being really moved, or finding something hilarious. But when I look at my work, you’ll see probably more of the stuff I keep private.

**TVDB:** Are there parallels between you and your character Fiyero in *Wicked: For Good*? He seems to be on his own journey of self-discovery.

**JB:** The characters in *Wicked* are all entirely fallible and there’s no good or bad. Fiyero makes decisions that are based not just on his human relationships, but also on what he feels is right. He’s so moved by Elphaba \[the Wicked Witch of the West, played by Cynthia Erivo\], who steps outside of a power system, who has independent thought and sees the world and communicates that clearly. And it’s an interesting character arc, because once he’s activated and has that sense of meaning, there’s no going back.

I mean, the lyrics to “Dancing Through Life” \[in the first film\] are entirely nihilistic. He’s like, “We’re going to die anyway, so let’s create chaos wherever we go,” presumably to match the chaos in his mind. But there’s a dull ache, I think, in Fiyero. He’s yearning for something — and it’s not just Elphaba, it’s the grounding of action and being on a meaningful path. He’s drawn to that first. I hope people yearn for a time when life was easier for the characters — as much as I feel like that about growing up sometimes — they’re having to take responsibility and decide who they are during a time when people are controlling narratives.

**TVDB:** Is that why you were attracted to the project?

**JB:** One thing Fiyero feels strongly is that Elphaba needs to be protected. So he leaves Glinda \[the Good, played by Ariana Grande\]. His inability to make a decision on his own is what “Dancing Through Life” is about, until he meets Elphaba and something is awakened in him. In the stage show it’s brilliant and moving, but it’s also kind of comedic and light. In this film it feels quite brutal and dark.

**TVDB:** Is the theatre where you want to spend most of your time?

**JB:** If I know what I’m going to do next in the theatre, then I feel great. I always know what the next theatre project will be. No matter what happens with theatre, you’re always working with extraordinary people in a room. It’s a diligent process, which is about fine-tuning. You come out with a nimbleness. It’s like sharpening your utensils before making a roast dinner.

**TVDB:** That’s a nice analogy.

**JB:** I started working in theatre when I was six and a half, by accident. I sometimes find myself remembering Helen McCrory’s voice — I did a play with McCrory, James Purefoy and Joseph Fiennes. Getting to hear her voice however many nights a week, that is just how incredibly lucky I was. I’ve never known anything different than the theatre.

**TVDB:** What’s the longest amount of time you’ve not done a play?

**JB:** The six years after I was born.

**TVDB:** So, you’ve done theatre, you’ve done blockbusters; are you entering your auteur era?

**JB:** Maybe. There are so many film-makers I’d love to work with.

**TVDB:** Can you share a couple?

**JB:** No. I’m sensitive to that. When I read other actors saying it I just go, “Oh God, how cringe.”

**TVDB:** OK, are there any exciting roles on the horizon? Following your fallow year, of course.

**JB:** I’m just doing that thing that swimmers do before they dive into the pool. There’s a couple of really exciting things. The expanding foam has been activated.

**TVDB:** This is the Better Men issue of Esquire. Who were your male role-models growing up?

**JB:** After going to a state primary, I received a music scholarship to the Oratory, before going to the Magdalen College School in Oxford for Sixth Form. I couldn’t believe how inspiring the teachers were. There was one in particular called Dr David Brunton, who saw me for who I was. I had 16 periods with him a week. He was just the most incredible, inspiring person.

For my dissertation, I started writing about the representation of Hutus and Tutsis in films about the Rwandan genocide. Then *Brokeback Mountain* came out. I can’t remember if I just wanted a reason to go back 10 more times to see it, but I was completely activated. Overnight, I decided to make my dissertation about the representation of homosexuality in the film. I remember coming to him and saying, “I want to do this.” And he said, “Do you know what? I think you’re on to something.”

I got a very good mark on that fastidiously researched essay. But I also remember once coming late to class and he asked, “Where have you been?” And I said, “Oh, I’m sorry. I was just talking to Mr Pearce,” and he went, “OK, wait there.” And he went and called Mr Pearce and he said, “Have you just been with Johnny?” And he said no. And he went, “Don’t be a dickhead.”

**TVDB:** A lesson!

**JB:** The reason I’m telling you so much about him is that he tragically took his own life when I was on my gap year. It was so upsetting and confusing. He was such a huge part of my life and I was lucky to be taught by him. I have to retrofit this person who was clearly struggling with their mental health. It felt like a very sort of formative and bruising time.

**TVDB:** What impact has he had on your life and career?

**JB:** I think about him a lot. I think about the fact that we studied Othello at school, and he would always ask me to read with him. Then I ended up acting in Othello at the National \[Theatre\], which I regard as my sort of breakthrough role. I think in my grief and confusion I created a connection between those two things. There’s a security or a calmness to the idea that something continues when someone passes away. I felt so prepped for the audition because of the extraordinary time I’d had with him. So, to then play Cassio in Othello… That was really amazing.

**TVDB:** Are you a spiritual person?

**JB:** Sounds like it, doesn’t it?

**TVDB:** I was thinking about what Joanna Lumley said recently about how all actors should be able to play all roles. What’s your take on that?

**JB:** One argument is, of course, everyone should be able to play everything. A hundred per cent. But if you’re someone who has been told that you can’t do a role because of something specific about who you are — something that people may be digging to discover — if you’ve had that experience, you’re not going to say that. Everyone deserves the opportunity to say everyone can play everything. And you can only say that if you have had the space. That’s the nuance.

**TVDB:** Do you feel like you have the space to play everything?

**JB:** Yes. But then also, I’ve always been like, “If I’m not invited, that’s fine.” I’ll go where I’m invited. We’re here for such a short amount of time. It’s about showing up and being brilliant so that other people can have opportunities, right?

**TVDB:** Do you feel the pressure to be brilliant all the time?

**JB:** Yes. But that, I think, comes from a complete reverence for directors and writers. When I go to the theatre, even now, I go: ""How do they do it?” I’ve just got that hard-wired in. So, if you’re taking the job, you’ve got to fucking go for it and do the best you can. Because there’s always someone who’s not able to play that part because you’re playing it. There’s nothing more frustrating than a performance that feels inauthentic or passive.

**TVDB:** That must be true for all actors ­— do you ever feel pressure as an individual?

**JB:** I’ve spent so many years thinking that I’m about to do my last job. And I’ve also been like, “I want to hold my boyfriend’s hand.” That’s a non-negotiable thing. It’s never been an option not to do that. I think that’s the benefit of being in theatre, because it’s a more inclusive place.

The opportunities available to me now are off the back of years and years of amazing actors playing all roles. There have been so many gay men that people have loved playing straight parts, whether you’ve known they’re gay or not.

**TVDB:** Are there any career-limiting narratives around Jonathan Bailey right now?

**JB:** Maybe that I refuse to wear shoes.

**TVDB:** Are we referring to the [red-carpet flip flops](https://www.esquire.com/uk/style/shoes/a65089881/luxury-flip-flops/)?

**JB:** Yeah, or just, like, that my feet are always out. As if I was going to play, like, a cobbler or something. I don’t know, I don’t really think about it. No.

**TVDB:** You’ve expressed irritation at being referred to as an “out gay actor”. Can you touch on that a bit?

**JB:** I just did an interview with Time magazine, and I explained it to the writer, and she didn’t refer to me as that. It’s so exciting. People responded and were like, “This is like the first time he’s not been referred to in that way.” That is change.

**TVDB:** Do you worry about AI coming for your job?

**JB:** The idea of the human creative spirit being sidelined or annexed is really upsetting and distressing. One thing I found doing Shakespeare this year is that nothing felt more radical or engaged than being in a room with words and people, and being in the round. There was such a crackle in the air. It’s radical now to get a pen and paper. I think there’s going to be such value in that.

**TVDB:** You’ve said that you don’t want to move to Hollywood, does that still stand?

**JB:** I’ve never really thought about it.

**TVDB:** But you’re becoming a Hollywood fixture, wouldn’t living over there be useful?

**JB:** Every film I’ve done has not been filmed in America. In my 20s, people would go out to pilot season. And I was like, “I don’t want to. I just don’t want to do it.” I can’t explain anything more than it’s just not for me.

**TVDB:** So, you’re more of a homebird?

**JB:** I tell you what, I love travelling with work. Being in Toronto filming *Fellow Travelers* and going to the Muskoka Lakes. I got to experience different communities and attitudes. I worked in Johannesburg when I was 23 and then Cape Town the year after that and I went to Thailand last year. It’s really bonding with the cast when you travel away. But this year I’ve been at home a lot more and I’ve been able to see my nieces at school, and I’ve been out to see my friends. I’ve been at more birthdays and weddings and that feels good. I’m yet to feel any need to move.

**TVDB:** Do you want to have kids?

**JB:** It’s amazing to be an uncle of six, and they’re all so cool and independent, you know. Do you want kids?

**TVDB:** I think so.

**JB:** Have you ever not wanted kids? As in, have you ever allowed yourself to not think that?

**TVDB:** There are moments where it’s like, it’s going to be expensive. It’s going to be hard. What’s the reality in this world?

**JB:** And there’s obviously loads of kids that could really benefit from love and support. I have the absolute privilege of being a gay man — there’s no biological clock. It’s such a privilege, isn’t it, to even be able to have a kid? So, I’m aware of it as an idea, as a concept, but it doesn’t feel very loud in my head at the moment.

**TVDB:** Do you feel like your life started later than other people’s?

**JB:** Well, no, but I was working. I’d done three plays at the RSC by the time I was 12.

**TVDB:** In terms of interpersonal relationships, though? I feel like a lot of gay men are late bloomers in the love department.

**JB:** I guess you never know where you are in relation to the mountain as you’re climbing it. But then you break through the clouds and you have to decide to keep moving through them. And that requires a bit of support and a lot of reading. And if you can, you know, if you have access to it, therapy is really good.

**TVDB:** Do you do therapy?

**JB:** For sure, at various different moments in time. Obviously, in a utopia, everyone would be able to have one session per week. But to answer your question about formative relationships, I went on holiday with most of my school friends who I’ve known since I was a teenager at the end of Richard II. And they were still referring to the boyfriends they had at school. They had these really intimate relationships. They slept over and breathed into the napes of their lovers’ necks. They knew what their partners smelled like. They were having that chemical thing that happened later on for me. But there are also so many reasons — outside of being a gay man — that would lead you to have a delayed formative relationship. There are so many people you meet along the way. It’s important to remember that.

**TVDB:** That’s true.

**JB:** I was having dinner last night and we were talking about regrets.

**TVDB:** What are yours?

**JB:** Well, I don’t have any.

**TVDB:** You don’t have any regrets?

**JB:** In the words of Édith Piaf, I don’t regret a thing.

1oszwoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1oszwoj/im_trying_something_different/,I’m trying something different,"Thinking my way out of stress has never worked. But recently I have started to feel moments of calm that I haven’t felt in years.

Assuming you are always anxious and stressed (even when nothing is going on).

I’m making *my body* teach my mind how to relax.

I ask myself this question many times a day: “how would my body behave if I were calmed?” 

And then i just ACT like if I were calmed and practice it. I wake up and check messages but then stretch, breath slowly, move slowly, cook relaxed, eat relaxed. Lay back a bit in the couch. Walk slowly to work, etc.

I realized that meditation or breathing techniques, or freaking nature audios don’t work in isolation. Meditate and then run to work is not “being calm”. Imagine you smoked a joint on a Sunday at the beach - and behave like that. Practice it.

Social nervousness, negative thoughts, or external stress still happen and then i ask the question again how would my body behave if i were calmed?

Do this repeatedly. Let your body signal your mind that you are chill.

You will feel tense at times like eating fast or rushing in useless ways. You’ll realize that’s what you are used to in your mind. 

I’ve been feeling less tight chest, less short breathings, even sleepy at times during the day.

Externally: If you have chronic high cortisol, see what foods you should be avoiding for some time (coffee, teas with caffeine like green tea); try chamomile tea. Avoid heavy divers before sleep, Etc.

The mind influences the body and the body influences the mind. If your mind is injured why pressure it. Let the body (that you can control more) teach the mind.

Long time lurker here, finally mustering the energy to post because, you know, adulting in Florida means endless sunshine and zero excuses to hide indoors… except that’s exactly what I do most days. I’m 34M, living in the Tampa area, and like a lot of us, I’m wired for solo vibes, recharging with a good book or grinding levels in a game beats forced chit chat any day. But lately, I’ve been craving those rare convos that actually click, the kind where you can geek out over a plot twist or debate a bad call without it turning into a group hang obligation.

A bit about me:

•  Gaming: Play Fortnite mostly but also Deep into single player epics like The Witcher series (Geralt’s brooding hits different) or co-op stuff if it’s chill, like Stardew Valley. Bonus if you’re into retro stuff—nothing beats a lazy afternoon with old-school Zelda.

•  Sports: Football, baseball, hockey, UFC

•  Movies: Anything Nolan-level mind-bendy (Inception still wrecks me) or underrated gems on Netflix. I’m the guy who pauses to overanalyze symbolism.

•  Books: Mix of fantasy escapes (Brandon Sanderson marathons) and non-fiction that makes you think, like stuff on psychology or history. Currently knee deep in a sci fi thriller that has me up way too late.

Open to chatting with anyone, guys, girls, doesn’t matter, as long as it’s easygoing. Discord for quick game nights? DM about that one movie we both pretend to hate? Or just swapping book recs when the world’s too loud? I’m not chasing a squad or weekly meetups, happy with sporadic, meaningful stuff that fits around nap schedules.

The office hummed its monotone song. Microwaves sighed to life as coworkers decided it was time for lunch, and the AC kicked on even though it was already too cold. The click-clack of keyboards, the familiar chorus of “Hi, thank you for calling…” I sighed, took out my headphones, and stood as the computer clock struck 1:15. Like a promise.



Evelyn and I sat together, talking about nothing and everything in between long moments of silence. The words slipped from her mouth a beat faster than her lips moved.



“Someone you trust is going to hurt you.”



Spoken with the certainty of someone who’d already seen it.



“What?” I laughed because that’s what my mouth knows how to do when my brain stumbles.



“What?” she echoed, blinking the words away like she’d never said them.



The phrase clung to me for the rest of the afternoon, heavy as fog. Maybe I imagined it. I hadn’t been sleeping well. Why would she say that and act like she didn’t?



Paranoia moved in like an old tenant, taking up space in my head while rational thought went on vacation. I kept waiting for something. A call from my mom, a text that started with “Hey girlie”, an accident. Anything. But nothing came except the time to clock out.



5:00 P.M.



I drove home. Time disagreed with me today. I folded laundry and arranged my son’s dinosaurs on the windowsill, smallest to largest. The clock on the stove read 7:05 for ten minutes straight. When I looked again, it read 9:15. I felt like I had missed a scene.



My bed welcomed me like an old friend. Warm, safe. I stared at the water stain on the ceiling shaped like a made-up continent.



Between the edges of consciousness, I sensed a person in the room. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. Sleep paralysis, I thought. So I stayed still and tried to breathe through it.



Cold hands wrapped around my ankles. Strong, certain. They pulled. Ice crawled up from my toes to the crown of my head. I wanted to scream. I couldn’t.



Wake up.



I sat up, a gasp dying in my throat as I blinked away the nightmare. My eyes adjusted. The room was my room. The curtains were my curtains. Everything was okay…



…so why did I still feel the cold lingering in my fingertips?



“Just a dream,” I said out loud, hoping the words could make it truer.



There was a weight on my stomach.



The pressure of a head. I looked down. Him. Lying there like he owned the space. I wanted to jerk upright, to scream, to say something. His hands were cold when they touched my face, a caress like a whisper.



“You’re okay,” he said. “Let me take care of you.”



Wake up.



My son’s hands shook my shoulder. Morning light filtered through the curtains. A dog barked, then forgot why and stopped. My son climbed into bed and, with all the grace of a four-year-old, said, “You’re not Mom.”



I laughed, because what else was I supposed to do?



“I’m the only one who makes you oatmeal,” I said, and he considered it like it might not be true.



The clock on the stove read 3:07 when we got up. I remembered daylight disagreed with that.



**Blink**.



The clock read 6:15. I got my son ready for daycare and drove to work. I wanted to ask Evelyn what she’d meant by that.



The day dragged. The coffee tasted like water apologizing for not tasting more bitter. I took my smoke break at 9:15. Evelyn and Adi came with me.



“You told me someone I trust would hurt me,” I said.



Evelyn’s mouth opened and closed like it was testing the mechanics. Adi frowned.



“Why would she say that?” she asked, before Evelyn could answer. Their voices sounded wrong in my head — slightly delayed, like playback out of sync.



I turned to Evelyn. “You said it, right?”



She shook her head. “I never said that.”



But she did. Right? Who can I trust if not myself?



The cigarette burned down between my fingers. We stood there in silence.



“Whatever,” I said. “I’m just tired.”



They both nodded, and it looked an awful lot like relief.

  
  


Part Two. Repetitions.



The rest of the day played out like a recording I’d already heard.  
 The phones rang, the same voices answered, again and again, on some pointless loop.

“Thank you for calling…” *Click.*  
 “Thank you for calling…” *Click.*

Even the hum of the fluorescents fell into rhythm. Had it always been like this? I couldn’t remember a time when it wasn’t. So it had to be.

At 11:45, I checked the clock. When I looked again, it was still 11:45.  
 I blinked hard, moved the mouse, opened my email.

A new message from Adi: *Lunch?*

I smiled. Finally, something ordinary. But when I clicked it open, the smile died.

“Don’t fall asleep.”

What?

I blinked. The words were gone, replaced by a list of sandwich shops I’d never even heard of. I stared until the screen dimmed, then stared longer.  Long enough to notice my reflection in the black monitor, blinking out of sync.

“Hey!” Evelyn’s voice snapped me back. She leaned on the edge of my desk, a cup of coffee steaming between her hands.  
 “You look awful,” she said with a smile that tried too hard not to sound like an insult.

“I didn’t sleep much.”

“You never do.” She sipped, eyes on me. “Maybe you should stop trying.”

“What?”

“What?” She blinked, confused, same as yesterday. Same everything.

It felt like reality was folding inward, and I could do anything but watch. When I got home, the house felt empty in a way I didn't recognize. Like the silence was daring me to break it, testing, waiting. The clock on my stove read 9:15. 



I made dinner. I think. 



The pan hissed, and oil popped. My son complained about the broccoli, and when I blinked, everything was already washed and on the rack. My hands were wet, but I don't remember water. The clock on my stove read 9:15, again. 



My phone buzzed with a text I opened too fast. I felt desperate. Grasping for something normal, something sane. Evelyn's name glowed on the screen. 



“Are you awake?” 



My stomach dropped, I don't know why. 



“Yeah, why?” 



“You shouldn’t be.” I stared at those words until they blurred together, and I was looking at nothing. I set my phone down, face-first. I didn't want to see the time anymore. The lights flickered, once, twice. And there, in the doorway, just beyond the kitchen. Was a figure standing, very still. 



I blinked, and the lights blinked with me. There was no one there, and the clock on my stove read 3:07. 



Part Three. Exhaustion 



Time mattered little when it wasn't being consistent. Days bled together in the click-clack of keyboards and repeated conversations. I don't remember when sleep stopped helping. I don't remember if today was yesterday or if I ever clocked out. 



I was in my car. 



Was I going home? Or was I driving to work? I missed my son, I missed my husband..husband..

Where is he? I pulled out my phone, and the time read 3:07. It always did. 

I got home. Finally. And I opened the door to absolutely nothing but darkness. 

**Wake up.** 

**Wake up!** 



Please, wake up.

*   **🌱 Growth:** What's ONE small win you've had this week? It could be anything—drinking enough water, finishing a tough task, or just getting out of bed on a hard day. Let's celebrate the small steps.

*   **🤝 Connection:** Share a piece of advice that has genuinely helped you recently. By sharing, you might give someone the exact words they need to hear today. Let's be that person for each other.

*   **💡 Fun:** What's something that made you smile or feel a spark of joy lately? A song, a funny video, a good conversation, a great cup of coffee. No answer is too small!

The goal isn't to have the ""best"" answer, but to simply engage and see what happens. To put some positive energy out there and build each other up.

And hey, I know sometimes the journey of growth and managing our inner world needs more than just a comment thread. For those moments when you're looking for more structured guidance on managing emotions and building resilience, I've found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful.

She arrived early, dressed in his favorite white dress, full makeup on. But when the door opened, Nicholas walked in, his arm around a girl who perfectly matched his dream-girl standards—168 cm, blonde hair, flawless skin, almond eyes. He looked down at her with soft eyes.
""Let me introduce you to my girlfriend, Melanie Rios.""
The private room suddenly became terribly quiet. Everyone's eyes were focused on Valerie.
Her knuckles were white as she clutched the wine glass, and her throat felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand. Even breathing became difficult.
Finally, someone broke the silence.
""Nic, are you serious?""
Nicholas leaned lazily against the couch and lowered his head to kiss the top of Melanie's head, ""Yeah, I'm serious. Do you think all 37 criteria for a girlfriend were just for show? I'm announcing that Mel is the only one I will ever marry.""
""She's the only one you'll marry? Then what about Valerie?"" Someone couldn't help but ask, ""She's been with you since she was eighteen...""
Nicholas seemed to smile, raising his eyes slightly to look at Valerie. His eyes were so unfamiliar that her heart trembled, ""I never made her wait.
""My girlfriend standards were public a long time ago. Is it my fault that she didn't meet them?""
When she heard that, her heart felt like it had been violently stabbed, hurting so much she almost doubled over.
But she knew everyone's eyes were on her, waiting to see her reaction.
So, she forced herself to raise the wine glass. Her fingertips were so cold she could barely feel the temperature of the glass.
""You're right. You never made me wait. It was a one-sided thing, so I'll accept the result."" She forced a smile, ""Nicholas, congratulations on getting what you wanted.""
Nicholas raised an eyebrow and held up his glass in acknowledgment, ""Thanks.""
He took a sip of his wine, his Adam's apple bobbing, ""There are tons of men in the world. Don't waste your time on me, Val. Try to like someone else.""
Valerie closed her eyes, feeling like her heart had been ripped to shreds.
She was only five years old when she first met Nicholas. He was wearing a little suit and playing the piano, just like a prince from a fairy tale.
From then on, she became the little shadow he couldn't shake off.
They were childhood friends. At their high school graduation party when they were eighteen, both of them got drunk and took each other's viginity.
When she woke up the next day, her heart was pounding. She thought her years of liking him had finally paid off, but he just threw a piece of paper at her.
He said this was his list of standards for an ideal girlfriend.
The paper was densely packed with 37 rules, from height and weight to hair color and skin type, even down to the shape of the eye and dimples when she smiled.
""Last night was a mistake."" He lit a cigarete and said casually, ""Val, I'm giving you two choices.""
Valerie's fingers gripped the bedsheet tightly, her heart growing colder bit by bit.
""First, we pretend nothing happened."" He blew out a smoke ring, ""Second, we both had a good time last night. We can be friends with benefits. If I haven't found my ideal girl by twenty-three, we'll be together.""
She took the paper with a trembling hand. The 37 criteria were like 37 knives, each stabbing her heart.
She didn't meet a single one.
""I pick the second option,"" Valerie heard herself say.
Because she didn't believe a girl like that even existed, let alone that Nicholas would actually meet her.
It was because she liked him too much. So, even if there was only a million-to-one chance, she was willing to bet everything.
For these five years, she made out with him in the back row of the classroom, passionately clung to him on the rooftop, and indulged with him in the locker room.
Everyone knew she was his, but he never admitted it.
Just yesterday, he was still gripping her waist and saying, ""Val, you're so soft. I wish I could just die on your body.""
But now he was casually saying, ""Go try liking someone else...""
Just because he was afraid she would pester him.
Her heart felt like it was being tightly squeezed. Valerie tilted her head back and emptied the glass of wine. The burning heat went straight down her throat.
""Don't worry, I won't bother you,"" she heard herself say, her voice so faint it was barely audible, ""I'll keep my word. I'll walk away for good.""
Valerie turned to leave but saw Nicholas gently feeding Melanie milk.
The girl had a little milk stain on her lip, and he lowered his head to kiss it off, ""You cute little fool.""
This sight felt like a knife plunging into her heart. Valerie stumbled out of the private room but was stopped by a few drunk men in the hallway.
""Hey, gorgeous, want to swap WhatsApp numbers?"" A strong smell of a1cohol hit her face. Someone touched her waist.
Someone in the private room yelled, ""Nic! Val is being harassed!""
Valerie looked through the crack in the door and saw Nicholas didn't even lift his head. His voice was lazy, ""I have a girlfriend now. What happens to Valerie has nothing to do with me.""
As he spoke, he pinched Melanie's cheek, ""Would you get mad if I went and helped another girl, sweetie?""
""Of course I would!"" Melanie cooed.
Nicholas smiled dotingly, ""Then I won't help her.""
""After all these years, you really don't like Valerie?"" Someone asked, unwilling to give up.
Nicholas chuckled, his voice clearly carrying out, word by word, stabbing Valerie's heart like a knife, ""How could I like her when she doesn't meet a single one of my girlfriend standards?""
This sentence shattered Valerie's last shred of dignity completely. 
She suddenly pushed away the drunk man in front of her and stumbled out.
The cold wind blew on her face, and her tears finally burst out.
Valerie didn't take a taxi and walked home for two hours against the wind.
When she got home, she looked at her wretched self in the mirror.
Her makeup was smeared, her dress was wrinkled, and her eyes were swollen like peaches.
This wasn't Valerie, and it shouldn't be Valerie.
She mechanically took off the messy white dress and tossed it into the trash can, just as easily as Nicholas had tossed away their five years of a relationship.
Then, she took out her phone and called Mr. Maguire, the person in charge of the London Symphony Orchestra.
""Mr. Maguire, I've made up my mind. I'll accept the offer from the London Symphony Orchestra.""

###Chapter 2
There were a few seconds of silence on the other end of the phone before Mr. Maguire's surprised and happy voice came through. ""Why did you suddenly change your mind? Didn't you say before that you wanted to stay in the country to be with someone you really liked and didn't want to go abroad...?""
""He doesn't need me now."" Valerie cut him off, her voice so calm it surprised even herself, ""And I don't need him either.""
Mr. Maguire was tactful and didn't ask any more questions. ""In that case, once you finish the paperwork, come over. The orchestra is always happy to welcome talent like you!""
After hanging up the phone, Valerie looked at the sky outside the window, which was gradually brightening.
A month ago, when she received the much-desired offer, she was so excited she didn't sleep all night.
She had played the violin since she was a child, and getting into the London Symphony Orchestra was almost every music student's dream.
But when she went to the Watson's villa and saw Nicholas sitting alone on the couch, smoking sadly, she couldn't bring herself to say, ""I'm going to London.""
When Nicholas was sixteen, his parents died in a plane crash.
She was competing in a violin contest in a nearby city and rushed back that night when she heard the news.
In front of the casket, Nicholas stood alone. The first thing he said when he saw her was, ""Val, I'm going to be alone from now on.""
She cried and hugged him. ""No, you have me. As long as you need me, I'll always be by your side.""
Since they were children, the girls who liked Nicholas lined up around the block.
But Valerie was the only one who truly grew up with him.
She had seen him hide in the music room with red eyes, and she knew he hated rainy days the most because they reminded him of his parents' funeral...
So, she didn't go anywhere, accompanying him day after day, year after year.
But now, they were each going their own way.
After sunrise, Valerie started sorting out everything related to Nicholas.
They grew up together, drank from the same glass of milk, read the same set of comic books, and slept on the same bed for naps...
She'd treasured everything about him, as if guarding her most precious childhood dream.
Now, she took all of it out and put the items into a cardboard box one by one.
This included the hair clip he gave her when she was eighteen, the cake mold he personally made for her twentieth birthday, and the hand warmer he bought last winter because he thought her hands were cold...
Everything, along with her love for him, was packed up, ready to be returned to him.
When she arrived at the Watson's villa, Benjamin, the old butler, opened the door. When he saw the box in Valerie's hand, his eyes immediately dimmed.
""Ms. Garcia, Mr. Watson took Ms. Rios shopping.""
Valerie was stunned for a moment, then gave a relieved smile. ""Please give this to him for me.""
Benjamin took the box, looking like he wanted to say more. ""Ms. Garcia, are you and Mr. Watson truly over? After all these years...""
""It's over."" Valerie said softly, ""He's found his true love, and I will find mine too.""
After saying that, she turned and left without a trace of lingering attachment.
After finishing her visa paperwork, Valerie remembered London's damp climate and prepared to go to the mall to buy some thick clothes.
She walked into a high-end clothing store and spotted a beige trench coat. Just as she was about to ask the sales assistant to wrap it up, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind her—
""I like this one too, Val. Guess we have similar tastes. We've both set our sights on the same coat and the same person.""
Valerie turned around and saw Melanie standing behind her, smiling sweetly.
Before she could speak, Nicholas's voice came from beside them. ""So what if you have the same taste? Whether it's the coat or the person, they only belong to you.""
He walked over and immediately took out his black card, telling the sales assistant, ""I'll pay ten times the price for this coat. Also, wrap up all the new arrivals in the store in my girlfriend's size.""
The sales assistant was overjoyed and quickly agreed, no longer caring that Valerie had seen the coat first. She turned to get everything ready.
""Nic, you shouldn't have!"" Melanie clutched Nicholas's arm and pouted.
Nicholas looked down at her, his eyes full of affection. ""How a man spends his money shows where his heart is. It makes me happy to watch you spend it.""
Melanie looked up and asked, ""Will you treat me this well forever?""
Nicholas pinched her cheek. ""Of course, not just this life, but the next life, and the life after that.""

###Chapter 3
Valerie quietly watched the scene, her heart twinging slightly.
This was the first time she had seen Nicholas like this. It looked like he really loved this girl who was 100% his ideal type.
She knew Melanie deliberately tried to snatch the coat. She also knew that as long as Melanie was around, whatever coat Valerie looked at, Nicholas would buy it for Melanie at a high price.
So, she didn't want to fight with them or watch them being intimate. She turned to leave.
But just then, the shrill fire alarm suddenly echoed throughout the entire mall.
""Fire! Run!""
Thick smoke spread instantly, and chaos erupted as screams filled the air.
Valerie was pushed and shoved by the crowd and couldn't stand steadily at all.
She looked up and saw Nicholas instinctively shielding Melanie in his arms, running toward the emergency exit without looking back.
He didn't spare her a single glance. He didn't even check to see if she was safe.
""Ah—!""
Valerie was pushed to the ground. Her elbow hit the marble floor hard, and the pain made her vision go black.
Before she could get up, the panicked crowd stomped on her several times. A sharp crack came from her right wrist, and pain shot through her so hard she nearly passed out.
Worse still, she was pushed near the escalator. She lost her balance and tumbled down the escalator!
Bang!
The back of her head hit a step hard, and warm fluid flowed down her forehead, blurring her vision.
She curled up on the ground in pain. All she could hear were the loud screams and footsteps, but no one stopped to help her.
In a daze, she saw Nicholas holding Melanie at the emergency exit, comforting her quietly.
Melanie seemed to have said something. Nicholas shook his head, and his voice clearly carried over. ""I'm your boyfriend. Whether something happens to Valerie or not has nothing to do with me. Now that I have you, I have to keep my distance from other girls.""
After speaking, he lifted Melanie into his arms and left without looking back.
Valerie looked at their retreating figures, her vision gradually blurring.
Her last thought before losing consciousness was that he had never lied.
He really had never felt anything for her.
When she woke up again, Valerie found herself in a hospital.
She was lying in a hospital bed with her left arm in a cast and her right arm hooked up to an IV drip.
The chaos at the mall had resulted in a broken right wrist, a mild concussion, and multiple bruises.
The doctor said she'd need at least two weeks of rest.
Her phone screen suddenly lit up. Nicholas had posted on Instagram.
Before this, his Instagram was completely blank. Even his profile picture was the default gray icon.
But ever since he got together with Melanie, he had changed to a cute couple profile picture. The background was Melanie's selfie, and his posts were flooding the feed.
The latest one was posted ten minutes ago. ""Peeled shrimp for my baby, and she complained I was too slow,"" he'd written, ending it with a sad face emoji to show mock frustration.
The accompanying picture was of Melanie pouting, with a full plate of peeled shrimp on the table. The comment section blew up. ""Holy crap, is that Nicholas? Did a ghost possess him?""
""Back then, the school's most popular girl brought you breakfast for a month, and you didn't even remember her name. Now you're peeling shrimp?""
""So he wasn't aloof, he just hadn't met the right person!""
Nicholas replied, ""I only do this for her.""
Valerie's finger hovered over the screen, but in the end, she didn't tap the like button.
She quietly closed Instagram and locked her phone.
Three days later, Valerie was preparing to be discharged from the hospital.
The sunlight outside the window was beautiful, shining on the white sheets and making her eyes ache.
The nurse pushed the door open. ""Ms. Garcia, your discharge paperwork is complete.""
Valerie nodded and slowly propped herself up to sit.
She still couldn't use her right hand and had to clumsily use her left hand to pack her things.
As soon as she reached the hallway, she heard a commotion.
Nicholas rushed in, holding a bloodied Melanie, followed by a group of medical staff.
""Save her!"" Nicholas's voice was incredibly hoarse, ""Quick, save her!""
Valerie had never seen Nicholas like this.
His white shirt was stained with blood. The wound on his forehead was still bleeding, and his eyes were bloodshot.
He was panicked, vulnerable, and hysterical...
Clutching Melanie tightly, as if he were holding the most precious treasure in the world.

###Chapter 4
""Mr. Watson, please calm down. We'll do everything we can to save her...""
Nicholas's voice trembled as he said sharply, ""Call your director—I want the best doctors and equipment! Money is not a problem!""
Soon, the entire floor was cleared, and the top medical team rushed in from all over.
Valerie stood around the corner of the hallway, watching Nicholas pace outside the operating room like a trapped animal.
""Nic, you're hurt too. Take care of your wounds first,"" one of Nicholas's friends urged.
""Get lost!"" Nicholas shook them off, his voice trembling, ""I'm not going anywhere until Melanie is out of danger.""
""Nic, this car accident was just an accident. If only she hadn't insisted on you speeding on the mountain road...""
""Shut up!"" Nicholas punched the wall, ""I failed to protect her.""
The operating room door suddenly opened. A nurse hurried out. ""The patient's kidney is ruptured and requires immediate transplantation, but we currently lack a donor kidney...""
Nicholas rolled up his sleeve without hesitation, ""Test me for a kidney match right now.""
""Nic! Are you crazy?"" His friends stopped him in shock, ""You've only been with Melanie for a few days. Is she worth it?""
Nicholas's eyes were terrifyingly cold. ""If anything happens to her, I can't live with it. A single kidney is nothing. If it can save her, I'd even give my heart.""
The sentence stabbed Valerie's heart like a knife.
She stumbled back and accidentally knocked over a potted plant in the hallway.
With a loud crash, Nicholas turned his head and finally saw her.
The moment their eyes met, Nicholas frowned.
""You... why are you here?""
Valerie raised her right hand, which was in a cast, ""The day at the mall, I fell down the escalator.""
Nicholas's expression froze for a moment but quickly returned to normal. ""Oh. Take care of yourself.""
After saying that, he turned and followed the nurse to test for a kidney match, not sparing Valerie another look.
Valerie looked at his retreating back and suddenly remembered when Nicholas had a persistent high fever when he was fifteen. She snuck out of the school grounds that night to buy medicine and ended up breaking her leg.
At the time, Nicholas held her and said, ""Val, it'll be my turn to protect you from now on.""
But now, he couldn't even bother to ask if she was hurting.
The test results came out quickly. It was a perfect match.
Nicholas signed the consent form without a word and went into the operating room that afternoon.
Valerie looked through the glass window at the two people lying side-by-side on the operating tables.
Nicholas turned his head and gently kissed Melanie's forehead as she lay unconscious.
This scene finally broke Valerie's last line of defense.
The difference between being loved and not being loved was painfully obvious.
She spent eighteen years trying to win Nicholas's heart to no avail, but Melanie did it in a few days.
She laughed at herself. The very last bit of affection in her heart finally disappeared completely.

###Chapter 5
When Valerie got home, she called the real estate agent.
""I want to sell the villa in Beverly Hills. The sooner, the better.""
That was the house her parents left her.
Her whole family immigrated to Canada when she was in college, but she insisted on staying behind.
Her father was so angry that he smashed his teacup. ""You're giving up your parents for that Watson boy?""
She was so naive back then, thinking that as long as she stayed by Nicholas's side, she would eventually win his heart.
Now that Nicholas had found the love of his life, it was time for her to let go completely.
A buyer for the house was found quickly.
The day she signed the contract, Valerie received a phone call from an unknown number.
""Ms. Garcia, I'm Melanie."" The voice on the other end of the line was soft and sweet, ""Can we meet?""
At the cafe, Melanie was bundled up in thick gauze. She was pale but still looked delicate.
She got straight to the point. ""Nic was injured, and he donated a kidney to me. Lately, he hasn't had much of an appetite, causing his wounds to heal slowly. I want to make him something to eat...""
""So?"" Valerie stirred her coffee without looking up.
""I heard he used to love the chicken broth you made the most."" Melanie bit her lip, ""Could you... teach me how to make it?""
Valerie's hand paused. She remembered that whenever Nicholas was sick, he would only drink the chicken broth she made.
Once, she had a high fever but still forced herself to cook chicken broth for him, only to collapse in the kitchen afterward.
""He likes you so much now, he'd be happy to drink anything you buy for him,"" Valerie said flatly.
Melanie shook her head. ""I just want him to taste his favorite flavor.""
She clasped her hands together, her eyes watery, ""Please, I know it was wrong of me to snatch the coat from you earlier. Please don't hold it against me and teach me.""
In the end, Valerie agreed.
She stood at the kitchen doorway, watching Melanie fumble with the ingredients.
She cut her finger while cutting the chicken and scalded the back of her hand while pouring hot water, yet she stubbornly tried again and again.
""Why are you so persistent?"" Valerie couldn't help but ask.
Melanie wiped the sweat from her forehead, a sweet blush spreading across her face. ""Because he's worth it.""
She started recounting the good things Nicholas had done for her.
He drove out at three in the morning to buy the strawberry cake she suddenly craved. He planted twenty magnolia trees in the yard because she casually mentioned she liked them. When she had a fever, he stayed up all night with her, checking her temperature every half hour. When she woke up groggily, she saw his eyes were red from lack of sleep.
""Compared to how good he is to me, what's cooking chicken broth for him?"" Melanie's eyes were sparkling. ""He told me I'm the ideal girl he waited twenty-three years for, the only person he wants to marry in this life.""
Valerie listened quietly, her heart felt like it was being slowly sliced open by a dull knife.
She remembered how she had poured her heart out for Nicholas too.
When he had a high fever, she went out in the rain to buy medicine.
When he was in a bad mood, she stayed up all night drinking with him.
On his birthday, she ran all over the city just to buy the limited edition sneakers he liked.
But Nicholas was always indifferent toward her. He wouldn't even thank her.
She'd thought it was just his nature and foolishly believed time would warm his heart.
Now she finally understood.
It wasn't that Nicholas didn't know how to love.
He just didn't love her.
When he met his true ideal girl, he loved her more passionately and deeply than anyone.
When the broth was ready, Melanie looked at the scalds on her hand and bit her lip in annoyance. ""I need to take care of my wounds first, or Nic will be heartbroken for ages when he sees them.""
She handed the thermos to Valerie, ""Could you please take the broth over for me?""
The chicken broth was still steaming in the thermos. Valerie stood at the door of the hospital room and heard Nicholas's gentle voice inside. ""Mel? Where did you go? Why didn't you come in?""
The moment she pushed the door open, the smile on Nicholas's face froze instantly.
The expectation in his eyes turned to surprise, and finally settled into an icy coldness.
""What are you doing here?!""
Valerie lowered her eyes, trying to maintain a calm expression, and placed the chicken broth on the bedside table. ""This is...""
""Take it away."" Nicholas interrupted her coldly, ""I won't drink anything you cook.""
He leaned back against the hospital bed, his face still pale, but his eyes were sharp like knives. ""Val, I have a girlfriend now, and I don't want to have anything to do with other girls, especially since we used to have that kind of relationship.
""You can say I wronged you, or that I'm heartless. I just want Melanie to feel secure.""
Valerie closed her eyes. ""You misunderstood. I didn't cook this. I just...""
Before she could finish, Nicholas cut her off, his gaze falling on the familiar thermos. ""I made myself very clear. I only have Melanie in my heart. I won't even look at other girls' attempts to be nice.""
He reached out, grabbed the thermos, and threw it into the nearby trash can without even looking.
A muffled ""thud"" sounded, as if it had struck Valerie's heart.
""Nic, what on earth are you doing?!""
Melanie's voice suddenly came from the doorway.
She quickly walked in, her hand still wrapped in gauze, ""That's the chicken broth I begged Valerie to teach me how to make all day!""
Nicholas's expression instantly changed. ""What?""
""I don't know how to cook. I wanted to make you better, so I asked Valerie to teach me."" Melanie's eyes were red with grievance. ""I even cut my hand slicing the chicken...""
Nicholas immediately sat up from the bed, ignoring the pain of his wound, and bent over to retrieve the thermos from the trash can.
He fumbled to open the lid, scooped out a bowl, and was about to drink it.

###Chapter 6
""Don't drink that! It's all dirty!"" Melanie quickly tried to stop him.
""It's not dirty."" Nicholas shook his head, his eyes unbelievably gentle, ""How could it be dirty if you made it yourself?""
He drank the broth in big gulps, praising the taste—as if he hadn't been disgusted by it moments ago.
Valerie stood to the side, watching Nicholas drink it with such contentment. She suddenly remembered the time when she had a fever and still managed to cook pasta for Nicholas who was up all night playing video games.
But because she was so hungry, she took a bite herself. He then threw the pasta into the trash can right in front of her.
Back then, Nicholas had severe germophobia. He would be disgusted by anything she touched.
But now, he could actually retrieve and eat something from the trash can.
Simply because Melanie had made it herself.
Valerie gave a self-mocking smile, unsure if she was laughing at him or herself.
As she turned to leave, she heard Nicholas's gentle voice from the ward. ""Sweetie, don't do these things anymore. Your injury hurts me more than my own...""
She closed her eyes and quickly left the hospital.
In the following days, Valerie stayed home to pack her luggage.
She folded her clothes one by one and placed them into the suitcase. With each item she organized, it was like sealing away a memory of the past.
The screen of her phone would light up from time to time with notifications from their mutual group chat.
He took Melanie to various parties and introduced her to family and friends, eager to announce to the world that he had found his ideal girl.
The photos in the group chat showed how close they were.
Nicholas had his arm around Melanie's waist, his eyes full of tenderness. Nicholas was leaning down to adjust the hem of Melanie's skirt, his movements careful. Nicholas publicly kissed Melanie's forehead at the party, drawing a round of cheers.
Everyone said that Nicholas had truly fallen in love this time.
Valerie quietly swiped through the photos. The strange thing was that the pain in her heart was gradually becoming weaker.
It was like a wound that had scabbed over. Although it still ached faintly, at least it was no longer bleeding.
Two days before her departure, Valerie met up with a few girlfriends for a farewell dinner.
""Val, are you really leaving?"" Her best friend, Evelyn Torres, held her hand. ""Not coming back after this?""
""Yeah, I won't be coming back."" Valerie took a sip of wine, ""The London Symphony Orchestra is the place I've always dreamed of. From now on, I'll focus on my career.""
The private room suddenly fell silent. Her friends exchanged glances, wanting to say something but stopping themselves.
""That's good,"" Evelyn finally broke the silence, ""A change of environment, a fresh start.""
Valerie smiled and raised her wine glass. ""Here's to a new life.""
After a few rounds of drinks, she got up to go to the restroom.
As she passed the next private room, a familiar voice made her pause.
""Nic, are you crazy? You've only known her for less than a month and you want to propose? Didn't you say before that people who rush into marriage are fools?""
Valerie instinctively stopped. Through the slightly open door, she saw Nicholas leaning back in his chair, a rarely seen gentle smile on his face.
""That was before I met Melanie. When Val was chasing me, I thought she was crazy too. How could someone need another person so desperately?""
Valerie's fingers suddenly dug into her palm.
""Until I met Melanie."" Nicholas's eyes suddenly softened, ""The first time I saw her, I knew I wanted to spend my life with her. When she smiles, I'm happy. When she cries, my heart aches. My feelings revolve around her completely. My eyes are always chasing her, and I can't help it...""
He paused, then pulled a velvet box out of his pocket. ""I've been planning the proposal since the first day we got together. I'm so afraid she'll belong to someone else. I have to make her my wife as soon as possible.""
The private room erupted in gasps.
""It's normal to be caught up in the hormones, but you're falling too deep! At least spend another half a year together...""
""I can't wait another day."" Nicholas's voice was very firm, ""I've never desired marriage and a family this much.""

###Chapter 7
Valerie stood outside the door, feeling like the blood in her body had frozen.
It turned out that more than ten years of being by his side truly couldn't compare to one month of knowing Melanie.
She turned to leave but accidentally bumped into a waiter carrying a tray.
The sound of the glass shattering startled the people in the private room. Nicholas opened the door, and when he saw her, his expression instantly changed.
""Val? You heard everything?"" He asked, frowning.
Valerie nodded honestly.
Nicholas's expression became complicated. ""Since you know, you should understand how much I like Melanie.
""Don't try to ruin this proposal—you can't stop it anyway""
""Don't worry."" Valerie cut him off, a slight curve lifting her lips, ""I won't be at your proposal.""
She paused. ""Because...""
""That day is also the day I leave the country,"" She thought to herself.
Before she could finish, Nicholas's phone suddenly rang with Melanie's special ringtone.
He answered the call, his tone instantly becoming gentle. ""Baby, I'm with my friends. I'll be right back...""
Valerie took the opportunity to turn and leave while he was on the phone.
Her back was straight, and her steps were steady, as if she had finally let go of a great burden.
After Nicholas hung up the phone, he realized Valerie was gone.
He looked at the empty hallway and vaguely remembered Valerie saying something just now, but his mind was completely focused on Melanie's call, so he hadn't heard clearly.
Never mind, it probably wasn't important.
He didn't think any further and went back into the private room.
The day Nicholas decided to propose to Melanie was also the day Valerie's visa paperwork came through.
Back at the villa, she contacted the agent again, signed the sales contract with the buyer, and after completing all the procedures, got into the car with all her luggage.
As the taxi drove toward the airport, her phone vibrated.
It was a message from the mutual group chat, sharing a live update of Nicholas's proposal.
""Quick! Nic booked the whole amusement park!""
""The fireworks show is so thoughtful, it's Melanie's favorite Disney theme!""
""I heard the ring is custom-made and it weighs five carats!""
She exited the group chat and opened her chat with Nicholas.
The last message was from a month ago when he told her, ""Val, I miss you.""
Her finger paused on the keyboard for a long time. She slowly typed one final message.
""Nicholas, I wish you a successful proposal. I will do as you wish and never see you again.""
The moment the message was sent, his status immediately showed ""typing.""
""Just don't bother me again. We're bound to run into each other someday. How can we avoid that? I'll treat you to a meal after the proposal is successful.""
Valerie looked at the message and suddenly smiled.
So, even now, he still thought she would pester him.
She didn't reply and immediately blocked him.
The boarding announcement sounded. Valerie took out her SIM card, snapped it in half, and tossed it into the trash.
In the cabin, the flight attendant smiled and guided her to her seat.
""This flight is bound for London Heathrow Airport. The estimated flight time is eleven hours.""
Valerie nodded and buckled her seatbelt.
The plane glided slowly, sped up, and finally took off.
Outside the window, the city she had lived in for twenty-three years grew smaller and smaller, finally disappearing beneath the clouds.
Valerie suddenly remembered that when she was sixteen, after Nicholas's parents' funeral, he stood in the sunset and told her, ""Val, it's just the two of us now.""
She slowly closed her eyes and thought, ""Nicholas, I won't be accompanying you anymore.

1oszrno,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oszrno/i_26m_masturbated_while_looking_at_nearby_sex/,"I [26m] masturbated while looking at nearby sex listings, my [34f] girlfriend found out and we are not well.","So some info to get an idea. In this relationship of almost a year we have had lots of ups and downs, a few trust issues from my side the first few months but a LOT from her side the whole relationship. We used to always get into fights for random stuff and she always put me through a whole situation of trying to prove otherwise. For example one time we had a fight and it just so happened that a female colleague (not even a friend of mine) uploaded a story that they needeed a Physio (my proffession) so I asked for some info, the same day a girl I have known for years who now lives in a different place with her boyfriend, finally got the bike she wanted and I sent her a congrats message. She then randomly saw me scrolling my phone, saw these conversations and thought that I did that because I was seeking attention after our fight.  
Another time which is the only time I give her some rights, is after a big fight I tried to get back to my previous endeavort he very next day. That one was one that she knew I felt remorse about having things ended between us, even when we were still just friends. Even then, I tried to do it because I thought things had ended for a wrong reason and the ""what if"" had gotten to me. I also wanted to fill the emotional void I felt with something else (immature I know but I never once even attempted contact before actually finishing stuff), something that was familiar but she accused me of just trying to stick my dick in some place.
This has led to being in a relationship where for months on end I have been walking on eggshells for the aforementioned reasons even though I explained myself numerous times. Supposedly if you don't like the explanation, you walk away, you don't keep living in doubt even though there was never really a reason.
2 nights ago I mentioned that my Master's proffessor was holding a seminar in my city and that I would pay him a visit. I do keep contact with him on instagram and are on very friendly terms. She was in complete disbelief that I was meeting my proffessor on a Sunday morning when he was holding the seminar, this is one example out of many I cant even count but for me felt like the final nail in the coffin.
I took my stuff from her house, went to my house and just chilled gaming and doing chores. I then searched reddit for ways to make the separation easier and a guy jokingly said ""wank it out and if you still think about her, give it another try"", so I decided why the heck not. 
I opened a p\*rn website, tried to do the deed but failed since I dont really do well without emotional stimulus so this led to what ruined things... What I did is opened a website I made an account on 6 years ago, a website with sex listings. Back then I was a virgin and made the account so I could hire an escort or something close to my region. This account not only provides escorts, but also men looking for women, women looking for men, couples looking for men etc.
The p\*orn I was watching was the latter theme, I couldn't get the deed done and remembered of the existence of this account so I logged in, searched for local listings but not to go through with it, just to play mind games on myself to make me finish and nothing more than that. Weird I know. I even never verified my account all these years, something necesary to partake in these listings if you are interested.
Today we went out for a coffee after she asked me to, and while I was not paying attention and had gone to the toilet she gave a quick check of my search history and found everything. She thinks that I was actually looking for couples to mess with and doesnt believe I was at home, even though my whole search history only has 15 minutes of empy space (fapping time), then went back to random searches about hobbies and then to sleep.
She now thinks I am human scum and doesn't want anything to do with me and tbf I myself didn't feel like things were going to go well with all the doubting I've been dealing with, but I don't want to end this with her being hurt for a misunderstanding. I have the strongest emotions I have ever felt for anyone but at the same time the least hope I can make it work. I know she really loves me back too but her trust issues have been choking me. I am confused as to how to continue

Been in Freemont for 2 years.  Thoughts I needed somewhere where I could walk to bars, coffee shops, etc but frankly I never really take advantage of that.  It's expensive and I stopped drinking, am usually in bed by 9:30, and heading into my 40's.

I'm married.  No kids.  No plan for kids.  I work downtown and spend my weekends pursuing outdoor stuff.  I'd like to live somewhere where I can have a backyard for my dog, have a bit more of a small town feel and not have a total nightmare commute.  I love the idea of commuting via train so I've considered Edmonds.  Tacoma feels like over committing to the train but maybe it's something I should consider.  I've also been looking in the Issaquah area because that commute seems reasonable and being off 90 gives me great access to a lot of awesome outdoor experiences.

I don't really know anything about Bellevue but have been wondering if somewhere in South Bellevue near 90 would be a good fit.  I've also been curious about maybe Shoreline or one of the South Seattle neighborhoods for the access to the Light Rail.

However, my family insists I should stop eating dairy, cabbage, beans, eggs, chocolate and coffee. Honestly, I’m ok without the cabbage lol and I only drink one cup of coffee, but everything else? I would do anything for my little one to feel better, but I also have a hard time getting enough calories in my diet.

1oszquc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1oszquc/how_i_finally_got_my_gerd_under_control_after_3/,How I Finally Got My GERD Under Control After 3 Years (Long - But Really Worth Reading If You're Struggling),"Hey everyone, I'm writing this because I wish someone had shared their full journey with me when I first got diagnosed. I'm a 32F nurse working 12 hour shifts, and I've been dealing with GERD for about 3 years now. It literally changed my entire life, and not in a good way.

It started gradually. I'd get occasional heartburn after eating pizza or drinking coffee, but I just chalked it up to stress from work. I was doing a lot of night shifts at the time, eating at weird hours, chugging coffee to stay awake. Then one night, I woke up at 3am feeling like I was literally dying. I literally couldn't breathe, my throat was on fire, and I was coughing so hard I thought I was going to throw up. That was my first real acid reflux attack and it scared the absolute shit out of me.

After that, it became constant. I had a burning sensation in my chest almost every day. I'd get this awful taste in my mouth, especially in the mornings. The worst part? The anxiety. Every time I felt that burning sensation, I'd panic thinking something was seriously wrong with my heart. I went to the ER twice before I finally saw a GI specialist who did an endoscopy and confirmed GERD with some esophageal inflammation.

As a nurse, I should have known better, but honestly? Being on the other side as a patient is completely different. I was exhausted all the time because I couldn't sleep properly (my shift times as a nurse are already bad) I'd wake up with acid in my throat. My diet became so restrictive that I stopped enjoying meals altogether. I stopped going out with friends because I couldn't eat or drink anything fun without paying for it later. I was honestly miserable and depressed for a long time.

What I Tried (Numbered because there were A LOT of things):

* This was the hardest. I cut out:
   * Coffee (this was brutal, I'm a nurse who survives on coffee)
   * Alcohol (there goes my wine nights)
   * Chocolate (why does everything good cause reflux?)
   * Tomatoes and tomato sauce (bye bye pizza and pasta)
   * Citrus fruits
   * Fried and fatty foods
   * Spicy food
   * Mint (apparently it relaxes the LES which is bad)
   * I also started eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of 3 big ones, and never eating within 3-4 hours of bedtime. This helped A LOT but took serious discipline.
* I bought bed risers and elevated the head of my bed by 6 inches. Not gonna lie, it felt weird for like two weeks, but it REALLY helped with nighttime reflux. I stopped waking up choking on acid. Also started sleeping on my left side which apparently is better for GERD.
* I tried a bunch of different things - Tums, ginger capsules, something called Claisen which is a subscription service that delivers GERD supplements monthly, DGL licorice, and aloe vera juice. All of these have been part of my routine for a while now, especially for nighttime symptoms.
* I was carrying extra weight around my midsection (thanks, stress eating and irregular shifts). Lost about 20 pounds over 6 months through diet changes and walking. This made a noticeable difference in my symptoms. Also stopped wearing anything tight around my waist.
* Started seeing a therapist because the anxiety was making everything worse. Also started doing yoga and meditation. The mind gut connection is REAL. The more stressed I was at work, the worse my symptoms got.

I'm honestly living pretty normally again. I still have the occasional bad day (like last week when I stress ate pizza at 12am after a super long shift), but overall? I'm not constantly thinking about my GERD anymore. I can go out with friends, I can travel, I can sleep through the night. It took time and consistency, but I finally feel like myself again.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1os2z4j)",7,1762734969.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

I've gotten quite a few matches on dating apps, but I see so many red flags when messaging that few of them move beyond that.  There was one guy, however, that seemed different from the rest.  He had emotional intelligence, he seemed supportive and the conversation was engaging.  We've been messaging for a couple of months already, we've met for coffee a few times and I feel like we really clicked.  It was his idea to take it slow, but we would text extensively about what we liked and what turned us on and whatnot. 

We finally decided to meet up and take it to the next level.  I showed up, we started making out, I started going down on him, we were both really into it.  Then this motherfucker slaps me hard across the face with absolutely zero warning or prior conversation about it.  I know this is some people's kink or whatever, but I wish he would've mentioned it beforehand, because then I would have told him not to even play slap me because I grew up with a violent father and my instant reaction to getting hit, is to hit back.  Which is exactly what I did, as soon as he slapped me I immediately slapped him back and shouted ""DO NOT!"" as he stood there looking stunned.  I just grabbed my stuff and stormed out, had him blocked by the time I got to my car.

Who the hell thinks this is acceptable?!  My cheek is still red and there's a small bump, this wasn't like a little tap, this was a hard slap with force behind it.  Is this what people do these days?  What the actual fuck?

1oszod4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oszod4,"UPDATE POST: Need advice: Barn manager told me my horse isn't ""guaranteed to be saved"" if I use another vet.","First off, thank you to everyone who commented and gave great advice to the situation. I knew the situation felt wrong, but I needed some outside perspectives to make sure I was not being the crazy one for wanting to treat my horse.  
The situation presently: The abscess continued to grow after the first vet visit, and by Friday (11/07), it was about the size of a small cantaloupe on his chest. It got to the point where he was refusing to walk, and it was very hard for him to eat comfortably. Thankfully, the employee I am friends with from before called me while I was at work, so I was able to call and send a family member to pick up antibiotics for him before they closed for the weekend. I am so thankful for her, as we were able to start medication ASAP. The outside vet I went to also offered to drain as much of the abscess as she could on a Saturday (11/09), and told me she would not charge a clinic fee, and only charge for sedation as she felt terribly that he was in that much pain and “didn’t want to make it about money”. She was only able to get about a fourth of the puss (about 40 mls), but was able to create an exit point for it to continue to run out of. The abscess was very deep, approximately 2 inches under the skin.  In total, she only charged me $34 for the whole visit, which I am so thankful for and appreciative of. I think in total I have only spent about $180 between meds, 2 vet visits, and supplies, which is nothing compared to what I would be paying with the barns primary vet. (I will be getting a thank-you card and coffee gift card for her next week!).

The employee’s personal horse that lives on their property 2 miles down from the barn I keep my horse at also ended up getting an abscess on her shoulder, so there are six horses total who ended up getting pigeon fever. Due to a horse nearby contracting it, I think it was likely due to contaminated flies in the area, as they were awful at the beginning of October. I still cannot figure out why the barn manager was being so secretive and dismissive of my horse's symptoms. As this seems like something nobody could have controlled entirely. She has avoided me since that phone call, which is ok with me. I really don’t want any more contact with her than absolutely needed. 

I am hoping to have my horse moved by the end of December. I have a family friend who has offered to keep him there once he is no longer contagious, and I will use them as a backup if needed, as I would like to have somewhere with an indoor arena. I’m waiting to hear back on another acquaintance who owns a farm with an indoor arena, but they do not have any boarders/lessons so they are deciding if they are open to keeping him there. Either way, we will be getting out of there. Thank you everyone again for your support and comments. I will ensure the barn manager understands exactly why I am leaving and tell her that the way she handled the situation is completely unprofessional. As for now, I’m going to focus on getting my horse back to being healthy!

4 celcius (typical fridge temperature) = 39.2 fahrenheit 

20 celcius (typical room temperature) = 68 fahrenheit 

65 celcius (typical coffee temperature) = 149 fahrenheit 


Do you stick to fridge temperature water/soft drinks for a nice 4 million, or do you go for room temperature water/drinks for a much better 20 million, or do you only have hot drinks for the rest of your life for 65 million (or maybe a little more?) Or is it something in between?

Long time lurker here, finally mustering the energy to post because, you know, adulting in Florida means endless sunshine and zero excuses to hide indoors… except that’s exactly what I do most days. I’m 34M, living in the Tampa area, and like a lot of us, I’m wired for solo vibes, recharging with a good book or grinding levels in a game beats forced chit chat any day. But lately, I’ve been craving those rare convos that actually click, the kind where you can geek out over a plot twist or debate a bad call without it turning into a group hang obligation.

A bit about me:

•  Gaming: Play Fortnite mostly but also Deep into single player epics like The Witcher series (Geralt’s brooding hits different) or co-op stuff if it’s chill, like Stardew Valley. Bonus if you’re into retro stuff—nothing beats a lazy afternoon with old-school Zelda.

•  Sports: Football, baseball, hockey, UFC

•  Movies: Anything Nolan-level mind-bendy (Inception still wrecks me) or underrated gems on Netflix. I’m the guy who pauses to overanalyze symbolism.

•  Books: Mix of fantasy escapes (Brandon Sanderson marathons) and non-fiction that makes you think, like stuff on psychology or history. Currently knee deep in a sci fi thriller that has me up way too late.

Open to chatting with anyone, guys, girls, doesn’t matter, as long as it’s easygoing. Discord for quick game nights? DM about that one movie we both pretend to hate? Or just swapping book recs when the world’s too loud? I’m not chasing a squad or weekly meetups, happy with sporadic, meaningful stuff that fits around nap schedules. Florida folks preferred for potential low key coffee someday, but online works too.

I am trying to be a different kind of person and I joined a small church, they're very inclusive and cool and have helped me so much. It has been very hard for me to let myself be part of a community, I've never been a part of any group for very long, I've definitely never FELT like part of a group. This feels like a place I could get close to that or whatever my version of that is.

Today was my first day making the morning coffee at the church and I've been looking forward to having a job there so I was excited to do well. Someone had already started making it when I got there which I tried to receive as helpful because it threw me off at first. Then during the service I usually sit out in the entrance area and write or color while I listen to it because the full thing is a little overwhelming for me. There was some kids out there too and one of them kept saying ""nuh-uh!"" to everything in the service. It was extremely repetitive and hard for me to ignore. I waited a little too long to remove myself from it and once I did I had to go cry in my car for a bit. This was okay and is actually kind of normal for me at church. I was definitely still heightened though and still was going to stay another hour to help clean up after. 

This amazing older woman who taught me the coffee stuff came over to me after service to see if I had any questions and if everything went smoothly. She gave me a sidehug and said ""I'm so glad you're here"" when she was hugging me I was already struggling not to cry but what she said made it impossible and I tried to hide it for a second but I was fully crying. She is so kind and asked the right questions and really helped me, she offered to do the coffee clean up and I accepted and went home. 

So much of just that morning is new to me, completely. I feel like I'm living in a new world. It's so hard to put into words, feels abstract in my mind but I can't believe I cried in front of someone and she helped me and I let her. Me even a year ago wouldn't have even been there in the first place but I just would not have cried, I never have had access to feelings around other people like that. It's like everything would shut off so I could be what the situation needed and now it's like I'm here for the first time. 

I guess I'd love some commiseration because it was a really hard day and I feel vulnerable and gross. I'm fighting all these thoughts of never returning or of writing her an apology or thanking her again (I realized I'm just looking for reassurance that's she's not upset with me) and I know I should just keep showing up and maybe thank her again next week. Really interested in your experiences with this kind of stuff too. It's like I'm going through the motions of being the kind of person I want to be and then I become self aware and go ""oh my god I let someone see me upset AND help me and other people might have SEEN"" lol

Looking for real conversation and steady replies, not just a one-off hello Open to low-pressure friendships, deeper chats, and someone who actually wants to keep talking I'm actually looking for someone who wants to build sod","Hey! I’d love to find someone who actually wants to keep talking for more than a day instead of drifting away after an excited start. I’m not into pressure or constant texting, but I do appreciate a little consistency — not instant replies every minute, just a real willingness to come back to the conversation so it doesn’t always feel one-sided. If you care enough to say hi again a day or two later, that already means a lot to me.

  
I’m 19 and pretty cozy at heart: I read way too much, I experiment with dinners that sometimes turn out amazing and sometimes end up as a funny disaster story, and I have a small collection of plants that I fuss over daily. I game on PC mostly — nothing competitive or intense, just chill indie titles and the occasional multiplayer session. I’m slowly learning chess and it’s delightfully frustrating in the best way. I’m also trying to keep a steady workout routine (mostly light stuff and yoga) and I’d love an accountability buddy — someone to swap streaks with or nudge me to do five minutes of stretching when I forget.

  
What I like talking about: books, cozy indie games, weird-but-working recipes, little plant victories and fails, gym or yoga check-ins, and the tiny ridiculous things that happen in everyday life. I love dumb memes for bad days and honest, low-key chats for everything else. I ask questions because I actually want to know about you — your routines, the oddly specific things you like, the embarrassing songs you listen to when you’re alone. I try to be the kind of person who remembers the small details and cares about the ordinary stuff that makes up someone’s life.

  
A few practical things: I’m in the US (Midwest), so time zones might matter sometimes, but I’m flexible and understand different schedules. I prefer low-pressure connections where we both feel comfortable checking in without guilt, and where neither of us expects constant availability. Voice notes or short photos of your plant/gaming setup/coffee are totally welcome if you like that. I’m not here for drama or ghosting; I’m here for the slow build of a friendship that feels steady and mutual.

  
If you’re kind, curious, and okay with keeping in touch regularly even if not every hour, message me. I’m up for trading routines, sharing reading goals, swapping recipe experiments (bonus points if it’s unexpectedly good), cheering each other on for small wins, and sending dumb memes when life needs a laugh. I’m open to being the consistent friend who’s actually excited to see your name pop up — someone who responds with care, remembers the little things, and shows up now and then. Let’s trade recs, share weird life updates, and maybe become people we look forward to texting.

  
If any of that sounds like you, drop me a message — I’m shy at first, but I warm up fast and I love building slow, steady friendships. Even if you just want a chill accountability buddy or someone to rant about a book with, I’m here for it.

I’ve been together with my boyfriend for almost 5 years. We live together and have 2 pets. We met partying so I always knew there was a wild side to him, but not to the extent that I have seen. I’m also young at heart but his lifestyle is pretty excessive. He has a ton of friends because he’s fun, but no one sees what happens during the work week and behind closed doors. To the point where we’ve both come to the conclusion that he’s an addict of both alcohol and drugs. What’s been alarming over the past couple of years is the fact that he’ll stay up all night either watching movies or playing video games, while he gets high. There’s been times where I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and he’s there with a bunch of powder on the coffee table, just walking around aimlessly. It’s scary and sad. This year he recognized his struggles, but then always points out what I do wrong. He’s really annoyed that I occasionally leave my laundry piling up or a few dishes in the sink that I don’t clean up immediately. He’s also constantly resenting the pets, as he think I pay more attention to them. And maybe I do because I hate it when he’s in that state, which is pretty much 6 days a week.

I’ve been supportive and I consider myself a good partner, and I don’t think I’m perfect by any means, but I’m struggling to accept  the fact that “I have to work on things too” as he says.

Small thoughtful messages, little check-ins, and respecting boundaries go a long way with me. I appreciate communication that’s clear but gentle, and someone who is emotionally available without pushing me into things I’m not ready for.

  
I’m pretty chill, laugh easily, and I like a balance of cozy nights in and spontaneous mini-adventures. Cozy nights might mean a movie marathon, cooking something messy together, or just sitting with fuzzy socks and talking until it’s late. Spontaneous stuff could be a last-minute drive to watch the sunset, trying a new coffee spot, or running out to buy snacks for a midnight picnic. I value kindness, curiosity, and someone who can be playful but also emotionally present.

  
I’m hoping for a real connection that grows organically—no rush, no pressure. Let’s take things slow, keep it honest, and enjoy getting to know one another.

I’ve got a Philips Saeco espresso machine (with a ceramic grinder). The grinder stopped working because ceramic rings broke, so I ordered two replacement rings (part 996530016342) from Amazon https://a.co/d/4xGjlIH and replaced.

Before reassembling, I did a full clean of the grinder and brew group. After putting everything back together, the machine works again and makes coffee - but now the coffee waste bin is full of watery sludge instead of the usual compact coffee tablets/pucks.

I’m 90% sure I reinstalled the grinder gear in the same position, but maybe I’m off.

👉 Question:
What could cause this sudden change? Did I misalign the grinder gear or calibration? Could it be related to grind size, tamping pressure, or brew group reassembly?

Things I’ve already checked:
1) Silicon ring are changed https://a.co/d/cptyM0y
2) Brew group cleaned and lubricant added
3) The mesh through which the washed coffee is squeezed out
4) Coffee still tastes okay - just messy waste

You’ve just settled in with a cup of coffee, a pet is happily snoozing at your feet, or a child is proudly showing you their latest art project. Then, it happens. The slip, the spill, the happy accident that turns your beautiful area rug into a potential disaster zone. For decades, the solution has been a frantic blotting session, a expensive professional cleaning, or just living with the stain.

But what if it didn't have to be that way?

Enter the game-changer in home decor: the **lightweight washable area rug**. These aren't your flimsy, throwaway bathmats. We're talking about stylish, durable, genuinely good-looking rugs that can be tossed in the washing machine. If you're skeptical, you're not alone. But once you experience the freedom, there's no going back.

Let's dive into why these rugs are becoming a must-have in every modern home.

## Why You Need a Lightweight Washable Rug in Your Life

This isn't just a trend; it's a practical revolution for anyone who wants a clean home without the hassle.

### Unbeatable Convenience for a Cleaner Home
This is the number one reason. From muddy paw prints to spilled red wine, life is messy. A washable rug turns a potential catastrophe into a simple laundry day. This is a lifesaver for:
*   **Pet Owners:** Banish pet hair, dander, and the occasional ""accident"" for good.
*   **Parents:** Glitter, juice, craft paints—no problem.
*   **Allergy Sufferers:** Regularly washing your rug removes dust mites, pollen, and other allergens that can get trapped deep in the fibers of traditional carpets.

### Effortless Handling and Versatility
The ""lightweight"" part is just as important as the ""washable"" part. Ever tried to lug a heavy wool or jute rug outside to beat the dust out of it? It's a two-person job. Lightweight rugs are easy to:
*   **Move for cleaning:** Simply roll it up and vacuum or mop underneath.
*   **Redecorate on a whim:** Swap your living room rug for a seasonal one without breaking your back.
*   **Take with you:** Perfect for renters who want to bring a touch of home with them to their next place.

### Budget-Friendly and Long-Lasting
High-quality, traditional area rugs can cost a small fortune. Plus, the cost of professional cleanings adds up over time, shortening the rug's lifespan. Lightweight washable rugs are generally more affordable upfront, and their ability to be properly and regularly cleaned means they'll look fresher and last longer than a rug that's accumulating ground-in dirt for years.

## What to Look For When Buying a Washable Rug

Ready to shop? Not all ""washable"" rugs are created equal. Here’s your checklist for finding a high-quality one that will stand up to real life.

### Material Matters: The Key to Comfort and Durability
The fabric determines the feel and performance of the rug.
*   **Cotton:** The most common choice. It's soft, absorbent, and gets softer with each wash. Think of it like your favorite t-shirt for your floor.
*   **Chenille:** A luxurious choice that is incredibly soft and plush underfoot, while still being durable and machine-washable.
*   **Recycled Materials:** Many brands now use recycled plastics (like water bottles) to create surprisingly soft, durable, and stain-resistant rugs that are also eco-friendly.

### Don't Forget the Backing: Safety First
A rug that slides around is a hazard. Look for rugs with a durable, non-slip backing.
*   **Latex or Rubber:** These provide excellent grip on hard floors like hardwood, tile, and laminate, preventing slips and trips. Many quality washable rugs have this integrated, so you don't need a separate rug pad.

### Construction and Weave: Low-Pile is Your Friend
For machine washing, a low-pile (shorter fibers) or flatweave rug is generally the best choice.
*   **Low-Pile:** It’s easier for the washing machine to agitate and rinse clean.
*   **Flatweave:** These are thin, have no pile, and are reversible, offering double the life. They are incredibly easy to wash and dry quickly.

### Read the Care Label (Seriously!)
This is the most critical step. A ""washable"" rug is only as good as its care instructions.
*   **Machine Wash vs. Spot Clean:** Some are fully machine-washable, while others might only recommend spot-cleaning.
*   **Wash Settings:** Most require cold water on a gentle cycle to prevent shrinking or fading.
*   **Drying Instructions:** Almost all recommend air drying. Never put a rug in the dryer unless the label explicitly says it's safe, as high heat can cause the backing to melt or the fibers to shrink.

## How to Style Your Washable Rug

Functional doesn't have to mean boring. These rugs come in an endless array of patterns, colors, and sizes to fit any aesthetic.

*   **In the Living Room:** A large, neutral washable rug can anchor your seating area and withstand heavy foot traffic. Choose one with a subtle pattern for a touch of modern elegance.
*   **Under the Dining Table:** This is a game-changer. Say goodbye to stressing about dropped food. A washable rug here protects your floors and makes cleanup after dinner parties a breeze.
*   **In the Kids' Room or Playroom:** Create a soft, safe spot for playtime that you can sanitize whenever you need to. Bright colors and fun patterns are perfect for sparking imagination.
*   **In the Entryway or Mudroom:** Trap dirt and debris from the outside right at the door. A lightweight rug is easy to shake out, and its washability means you can combat even the muddiest of boots.

### The Final Word: Embrace the Ease

Upgrading to a **lightweight washable area rug** isn't just about buying a new piece of decor. It's about buying peace of mind. It's the freedom to let your family, pets, and friends live fully in your home without the constant fear of irreversible stains.

It’s time to stop treating your rugs like untouchable museum pieces and start enjoying them as the functional, beautiful foundation of your home they are meant to be. Your floors (and your sanity) will thank you.",1,1762733258.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False

Fast forward a few days to a week or two, we hardly talk, we’ve essentially run out of things to say. Which is when i’d imagine most people say “want to get a coffee?” Or some other thing to get past the digital messaging stage. But then the issue still is there— **what to even talk about?** 

ANYWAY, there’s this guy in my class who i’m really interested in— we’ve talked in class over assignments, and are in a groupchat so i have his number— would it be horribly odd to ask “would you want to get food at ___?” Or “i want to get to know you better” etc.? 

I’ve thought of starting out as friends, but… that feels like a great way to get friendzoned which would hurt more than being turned down straight up. 

So with that thought train, the only logical option is to ask him if he’s single, and if he’d be interested in dating me. Right? And if he’s taken or not interested, that’s fine— as i’m prepared for that answer.

I’ve been playing it out in my head— but every situation i can think up feels so… unrealistic, or cheesy or cliche— 

I’ve literally never been interested in a guy in this specific way. Obviously i’ve been attracted to guys sexually before, but this is different. I want to have this guy over for dinner, find out what kind of hobbies he enjoys, his food preferences. But all that in mind i’d probably cry in a hole if he’s already taken or just not interested in me at all.

I need an outsiders perspective on my relationship, because I want to always see both sides of the coin, but I’m realllllly struggling to.

I’ve been together with my boyfriend for almost 5 years. We live together and have 2 pets. We met partying so I always knew there was a wild side to him, but not to the extent that I have seen. I’m also young at heart but his lifestyle is pretty excessive. He has a ton of friends because he’s fun, but no one sees what happens during the work week and behind closed doors. To the point where we’ve both come to the conclusion that he’s an addict of both alcohol and drugs. What’s been alarming over the past couple of years is the fact that he’ll stay up all night either watching movies or playing video games, while he gets high. There’s been times where I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and he’s there with a bunch of powder on the coffee table, just walking around aimlessly. It’s scary and sad. This year he recognized his struggles, but then always points out what I do wrong. He’s really annoyed that I occasionally leave my laundry piling up or a few dishes in the sink that I don’t clean up immediately. He’s also constantly resenting the pets, as he think I pay more attention to them. And maybe I do because I hate it when he’s in that state, which is pretty much 6 days a week. 

TL;DR! - I’ve been supportive and I consider myself a good partner, and I don’t think I’m perfect by any means, but I’m struggling to accept  the fact that “I have to work on things too” as he says. I know it’s not a competition but to me his substance abuse is much worse than my dishes in the sink.

Someone knocked quietly on Boyd’s door, and I straightened up, my grin already forming as I recognised my girl’s light tap. Boyd gave me a chin lift toward the door as he rolled to his feet and disappeared into the dressing room to finish changing. I took the wordless cue and answered it.

“I’m sorry, honey-bear, but we need to get ready for school.” She glanced warily over my shoulder.

I knew Boyd was out of sight, but I still stepped out into the hallway and pulled the door shut behind me. “It’s fine. We said what we had to say.”

“And it ended well?” she probed, still not convinced, given Boyd had knocked me out with one punch two days ago.

“Yep. I asked him if I could use him as a therapy surrogate, and he told me to eff off.” I was walking slightly ahead of her as I spoke, which was why I didn’t expect her sudden stop—or the way she yanked me back in line beside her.

“You did *what?”* she demanded, and I quickly raised one finger to cover her lips gently.

“It’s a guy thing, honey. We bonded over being in therapy, and he said we both have to…” I frowned, pulling the exact words from memory without needing to dip into internalising this time. “…embrace the suck.”

She seemed to think about that for a second, then smiled and melted against me. “You have something in common with him now.”

“Yeah, and it’s kinda great.”

“Pretty sure he’ll like being your ‘big brother’ in all this, too. It’s close enough to the dynamics you shared before.”

Mason’s head popped out of his room. “Did I hear you say you were in therapy, dude?”

I closed my eyes with a groan and lowered my head to Gerry’s shoulder. “Freaking bat-eared jerk,” I whispered against the skin of her throat, and she snickered.

“That’s awesome!” Robbie called from the kitchen.

Okay, *now* I wanted the floor to swallow me.

“What is?” Brock asked, still at the island.

I may have whimpered as I turned to face them all, with Robbie leaning back in his seat, waiting for my permission to tell him. My hands were thrown over my head in disgust. “Go ahead. It’s not like Mason won’t tell everyone in ten seconds anyway,” I muttered.

“Hey, I resemble that remark.” Mason grinned—and just to prove me wrong, he stayed quiet long enough for Robbie to say,

“Sam’s also seeing a therapist.”

“Well, don’t be thinking you’re gonna sic one of those shitheads onto me,” Brock growled, cuddling Zephyr close. “My divine attack cat might have to fuckin’ hurt someone …won’t you, baby girl?” he asked, snuggling the furball on his lap.

Robbie smirked. “I think I could handle whatever your ‘attack cat’ could throw at me.”

“And if you couldn’t, I would,” Larry warned from around the corner where I couldn’t see him.

*Yeah, that wasn’t ominous at all.*

Robbie’s hand came out to cuff Brock in the back of the head. “And zip it with the swearing so much. You’re a fifteen-year-old in a school uniform now, not a jaded adult mouthing off in a club hallway.”

“Like any of you will let me forget,” Brock grumbled.

Mason came out to join us in our trek towards the kitchen. “Still don’t get why you’re the one who doesn’t need therapy, man,” he said, stopping at the island while Gerry and I carried on through to our dressing room. “Out of all of us, you’ve had it the roughest—and now you’re a guy stuck in a kid’s body.”

“Only for a couple of years,” Robbie insisted, wrapping an arm around Brock’s shoulders and pressing a kiss into his hair. “Long enough to shake you out of your dodgy decision phase.”

I shut the dressing room door and cut off the rest of that conversation. I had my own theories about why Brock didn’t need therapy. Most mortals who worshipped Uncle YHWH and were later touched by him after death didn’t have to worry about things like a screwed-up head. Sure, Brock could still be mad about his circumstances—but the crazy? That was ancient history.

As she did every morning, Gerry had laid out two sets of clothes for each of us, wanting me to have the final say. “Do you know what the weather’s doing today?” I asked, liking the lighter pale blue blouse and a simple straight white skirt that would sit just above her knee. The gold buckle on the chain belt was too similar to mine to be an accident.

“It’s going to be overcast,” she answered, still standing to one side.

I didn’t like the sound of that. Overcast meant temperature drops and possibly cold winds. I looked at the other outfit with elbow-length sleeves and long cotton pants—then waggled my finger at the first while still eyeing the second. “I like this one better, but…”

“What if I wear this over it?” she asked, appearing with a white— I’d normally call it a coat, except it barely came down past the armpits and had just one button in front. An arm-warmer, perhaps? Technically, that fitted the bill.

“Will your legs be warm enough?”

“I can wear light skin-coloured stockings.”

I pictured it all together, then nodded in approval. “Okay, then. That one.” 

For me, I went with a brushed gold button-up shirt, navy pants that were dark enough to almost be black, and my favourite black belt with the gold buckle. My bomber jacket and sneakers were a given.

We took everything we needed into our bathroom and came out half an hour later, ready for school (with Gerry having finished her hair and makeup in under ten minutes, which I was incredibly happy about).

“What time’s your graduation tomorrow?” Robbie asked as we returned to the kitchen to collect our lunch on the way out the door.

“Midday,” Gerry answered for me, which was just as well — I hadn’t been paying much attention when they’d announced it at school. We were going to be at school all day anyway with our newbies, so it didn’t make much difference to me.

“I’m not gonna make it, man,” Mason said, emerging from his side of the apartment. “I’ll still be at work…”

“It’s fine. If you really want to see it, I’m sure a million different people will be filming it, and I can get a copy of the footage.”

“A Nascerdios is graduating college, and you think Nuncio’s not going to be all over that,” Larry huffed, shaking his head at our stupidity.

I hated to admit he had good reason.

“I’ll be filming it, too,” Robbie said.

I turned to squint at him. “You’re not going to embarrass me, are you?”

Robbie placed both hands against his chest as if I’d crushed all his dreams at once, and when I levelled a sour look and shook my head at him, he cackled.

“Asshat,” I chuckled, as he picked up two different-sized lunch bags and handed the regular one to Mason, and the one that looked like it was trying to impersonate a backpack went to me. “Are we feeding the whole school?” I asked, testing the weight. It had to be at least fifteen pounds. Maybe twenty.

Robbie braced both hands on the island and leaned onto them. “I don’t know what to tell you, Sam. But if I were a betting man, I’d say it’s because this is the last meal you’ll have with your newbies, and it’ll have more of a send-off vibe than a lunch.”

I squinted at him again. “You know they’re adults, right? They have their own homes and lunches and everything?”

Robbie merely thumbed at the fridge on his right. “You’re perfectly capable of making up your own lunch, too, but I don’t see you volunteering for that either. Do you?”

He had me there. “Fine.” Fortunately, my real backpack was pretty much empty, so Robbie’s bag slipped inside without any hassle. I threaded my fingers through Gerry’s and headed for the door. “Thanks, man.” I then lifted my voice to include everyone else. “See you all this afternoon.”

“Bye, everyone! Thanks again!” Gerry called as Mason got the door for us.

“Later!” he called, heading out first.

Since it was still before eight, Rubin waited for us downstairs beside the car.

\* \* \*

Boyd came out in time to hear the front door close. “Just us now, huh?” he asked, rounding the corner into the kitchen and heading for the pantry cupboard. He searched for the spaghetti jar of different coloured shoushouko sticks and tucked it under his arm once he found it.

Robbie followed him around until he was leaning against the island. “You know that whole jar doesn’t have your name on it, right?”

“Give me two seconds with one of my divine scalpels and I’ll soon fix that.”

Instead of being annoyed, Robbie’s face lit up in a huge smile, making Boyd wonder what he’d said.

“Someone’s in a good mood,” he sing-songed, causing Brock to snicker.

Boyd shrugged but couldn’t deny it. As far as starts to the day went, this one hadn’t been bad at all. A little rocky in the beginning with that cat debacle, but he was glad he fought back his instinct to tell Sam to go away when he knocked on his door. Just that small effort, that small change, and his day was already looking brighter.

“I’m going to get stuck into those carvings. Hit them as hard as I can while Doctor Kearns is okay with it. That way, if he changes his mind back tomorrow, I’ll have made the most of today.” He unclipped the flip-lock and pulled out a single stick, biting a piece off so the stick broke an inch below his teeth. He put the rest back.

“I’d love to know how you do that,” Brock said, watching the move.

“Roll the jaw forward and create a pressure fissure further down the stick,” he said, locking the lid. “You know I’ve been eating them for years, and there’s always a trick to not getting sticky fingers from dripping saliva.”

Brock blinked at him. “Yeah, it’s called a paper towel.”

Boyd lifted a finger off the jar to point at him but otherwise didn’t comment on the sass. “Anyway, the sooner I get settled in the office, the sooner I start work. Thanks for breakfast, Robbie. And everything else.”

“Anytime, big guy. I’ll bring you in lunch when it’s ready.”

With that, Boyd nodded, collected the carving of Sam’s family from the living room coffee table, and headed out the front door to the studio next door.

\* \* \*

“Wow,” Charlie said, turning in her seat to watch Boyd go. “Is it my imagination, or has he seriously mellowed out lately?”

Robbie smiled fondly as he too looked at the closed front door. “Don’t jinx it, sweet pea.”

I (29F) have been financially supporting my family for years.  It started when my father had to retire early due to health reasons.  My mother's part-time job wasn't enough to keep the household going.  It started with a bill here, groceries there, etc.  But now I pay half of their mortgage and all of their electricity, water, and cable... and give them $200 a paycheck to cover anything else they need.  In all, I probably hand over around $900 a month to them.

My dad would say he'll eventually get back on his feet and get a part-time job, but he never did.  My mother said she'd try to get more hours, but never did.

You would think that would mean we have a great relationship, right?  Nope.  My brother and I have been set up in a golden child / scapegoat dynamic.  I was expected to get straight A's, he'd be celebrated for a B.  In high school, they attended two of my extracurricular events, but attended every one of his sports events.  When I went to college, I was fortunate enough to get a full scholarship to a college I didn't really want to go to, but my parents told me they had no money to help with college, so I went to the school that could cover my education.  My brother got a partial sports scholarship and my parents somehow had money to cover the rest.  My mother even got a second part-time job so he'd have spending money.  I graduated and got a good job.  He got caught dealing weed, lost his baseball scholarship and dropped out.  He lives at home, mooching off of my parents and is an ""entrepreneur"" that has started 3 failed businesses with my parents' help.

Funding their lives has not changed the dynamic between us.

My husband Tom and I went to their house for a dinner a month ago.  My mom mentioned my brother had a great new idea for a business (a food truck going from gym to gym, selling keto-friendly food) and was already doing some market research (going to the gym as usual).  

My mother casually mentioned he needed $20,000, in a way that was more like telling me to find the money for him.  I told them I can't take out a loan for him and my dad said once the business picks up, my brother would pay the loan back. I told them I would not take out a loan for him and it all blew up.

You see, a couple of weeks before that, I found out I was pregnant.  I wanted to keep it secret until we were out of the woods with tests, but I told my family I can't take out a loan because I need to start preparing for my child.  I also said that I needed to start cutting back on the money I give them and that's when the shit really hit the fan.  After a lot of yelling, Tom and I were kicked out and I was told I was dead to them.  Stupidly, I kept paying their bills.

This weekend, my mother asked to meet up over coffee.  We went to a cafe and after some awkward small talk, she accused me of threatening them with cutting them off.  I told her that wasn't the plan, but I need more money for my new family.  She said I was just going to let them starve and I reminded her that dad is healthy again and my brother doesn't pay any rent, but she said my father has earned retirement my brother is trying to find himself.  

Then she said, ""Your father and I were talking and we don't think now is a good time to start a family.  You and Tom should wait until everyone is more stable.""  I told her that I couldn't exactly pause a pregnancy and she put her hand on mine and said, ""It's still very early.  You have a lot of options.""  I asked her if she was seriously suggesting I abort her grandchild because she can't try to live within her means and she said I need to realize that Tom and my decision affects all of them.  I took a $10 bill from my purse, threw it on the table and replied, ""You were right.  I'm dead to you.""

An hour later my father called and asked what I did to my mother, because she's inconsolable.  I blocked them all.  I cancelled every automatic payment.  This is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life

They will not be able to live without my money.  My mom's income would barely cover the mortgage (they got a second mortgage to fund my brother's last business attempt).  I'm starting to feel guilty because they will lose the house and be homeless without my support. And I hate that there's a cruel part of me that wants to see them suffer because I'm just giving them the same support they've always given me.

Isn't that a great gimmick? What's that you say, it's played out after us doing it for five seasons of Breaking Bad and God knows how many (it's hard to keep track when you're so bored) of Better Call Saul? Noooo, it's brilliant and clever, because it's monotonous, directionless and boring.

You see, if people want to be entertained by a TV show, they're thickos who should just watch Breaking Bad, a vastly inferior show due to it's constant tension, iconic performances, appropriately aged actors, unforgettable moments and unique visual style. If they're really smart, they prefer a lame prequel with far worse acting, characters that look a hundred years old when they're supposed to be forty, an absolute spaghetti and meatballs mess of contrived, amateur lit esque ""themes"" and ""ideas"" that a writer dreamed up whilst wanking himself off into his fourth frapaccino of the day.

Look, good stories don't take forty minutes to do something that can be done in five. And if they do, it's with good reason.

There are some good elements, some of the actors are great, some of the characters are good, some of the dynamics between said characters are good, hell, there are even some great episodes.

But let's get it straight, this show is not fit to lace Breaking Bad's boots. And it's laughable that people delude themselves into believing that the reason it's so slow is on purpose. It's slow because Netflix wanted them to make six seasons out of a show that should have been four at most. About 40% of the show is utterly pointless dead weight, and that is simply an unacceptable amount for a show that people claim is one of the best ever. Sorry but that's laughable.

There are so many great shows and movies that deal with characters, where there aren't a lot of dramatic events, where things move slowly. Better Call Saul isn't one of them, and the only time it truly succeeds as entertaining or convincing is when the writers give up and say ""screw it, shall we just do Breaking Bad again?"" - yes please. You aren't good at being deep or clever, but when you actually put your heads together to frame some gripping drama you do it better than anyone else in the business.

First of all, Bob Odenkirk is not a good dramatic actor. He's not bad, he's just not good either. People think he's good because they watched him in a lead role for six seasons. ""Wow, remember the time when he made that face when that guy got shot?! So good!"", ""remember when he made a quippy remark in the same way he makes every quippy remark??"" ""remember when he had a fight and raised his voice a bit?"" - speaking of his voice, this is by far his worst attribute as an actor. He's terrible at using his voice. He barely utilises the depth that all human voices have. Compare this to Bryan Cranston, who uses timbre and pitch to convey so much about his character and to give himself a stratospheric level of screen presence in comparison to Bob Averagekirk, who speaks in the same thin, tepid boretone in every scene.

Rhea Sheehorn is fantastic in the show, despite being given an utterly dogshit character. I mean what the fuck was that? Four seasons of nonsensical, incoherent chopping and changing, making it up as they go along before they randomly go ""OH YEAH BY THE WAY HER MUM WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND THAT'S WHY SHE DOES ALL THIS NONSENSICAL SHIT"" - K. That's wRiTiNg I guess!! 

Why do the characters in the show do things? Because the writers want them to.

Why do things happen in the show? Because the writers want them to.

Why do people pretend this show is brilliant? Because the writers want them to.

The absolute stench of the writers is in every scene. Vince Gilligan made this! Vince Gilligan made this! Vince Gilligan made this! It screams out at you constantly, because it's so clearly a fake, contrived human creation. It isn't natural, it doesn't fly off the screen, it's a fucking mess.

Jonathan Banks is great as Mike. In fact, I think he's even better in this than he was in Breaking Bad, and the character is given some well deserved depth, particularly with that phenomenal episode in season one (now THAT'S TV.) Unfortunately he appears to be literally melting at this stage, and the production crew have made absolutely no effort to hide that. I guess we're just supposed to suspend disbelief about that and every other single thing that happens, no matter how much it takes us out of the show. Either way he's a great, economical actor who can do so much with so little. His tiny facial movements convey such a wide range of different types of misery. When given a good script he's generally a joy to watch.

Giancaro Esposito is good as Gus, again he looks about 400 years older than he did in Breaking Bad but whatever. Performance is a bit repetitive, does the same dramatic stare serious face morphing into uncanny valley smile gimmick over and over again but that's probably what he was asked. In general his performance in both shows were pretty overrated but he has good screen presence and was a good fit for the role. Still, not a lot of work to do.

Michael Mando was a revelation as Nacho Varga, and probably the best thing about the show. He knows exactly how to do action/suspense and to put the viewer right in the middle of it with his perfect command of facial expressions and body language. He conveys dread and panic as well as any actor in the Breaking Bad universe, and really those are the moments that the show survives on. Him being chased by the twins was proper TV. Not pretentious, not out of touch writers pretending to know about normal people, not making me spend 25 minutes watching some incredibly tedious montage of someone eating doughnuts. No. Gripping, efficient, powerful, ENTERTAINING TV. If you can't do clever don't try. Just be enjoyable for Christ's sake.

The guy who plays Chuck was also fantastic, unfortunately they didn't do enough with the character and completely wasted his performance. He is one of the only people Odenkirk has any chemistry with (Jimmy and Kim are one of the weirdest couples ever.) Unrelated but this guy would make a phenomenal L. Ron Hubbard. He really is quite good. Still, the afraid of electricity thing was hard to get too invested in because it just felt so completely made up. Why is he afraid of electricity? Because the writers want him to be!!

Any scenes relating to the world of business come off as having written by people who have never had real jobs before. Jimmy's job hunting experience is just absurd. Just completely ridiculous and not even a little bit realistic.

But the biggest failing of the show is the piss-poor, lazy depiction of Jimmy as a con artist. His ""schemes"" are about as well written as something from an episode of Kerching! on CBBC. They aren't believable, they aren't things that would ever work, it was a lame attempt at making him an interesting mind in the same way that Walter White was. But Walter White, whilst an exaggerated character, had a believable form intelligence. With Saul you're meant to go ""wow! He's so good with people haha! What a trickster!!"" and not think at all about how idiotic and conveniently written his scams are. They just come off as so lazy. Also, if he's such a brilliant scammer who understands how to manipulate people why would he do such absurd stuff, like screaming in the hallway about how he duped everyone to get his license back? A guy who's such an experienced and accomplished liar would never do anything like that.

On the subject of it Breaking Bad, it's not even really ""different"" in the way people claim it is. It's actually a shitty, hollow rip off of their own show. The trajectory is virtually identical. Saul is Walt. Kim is Jesse. Gus is Gus. Lalo is the Nazis.

Yeah, Lalo. Funny character, well acted. Too cartoonish even by Breaking Bad standards, but still entertaining. Very ""Netflix"", but still, better than being bored to tears by another four hours of SHIT about !!!Mesa Verde!!! Omg what's gonna happen to Kim's made up job??! Will that completely unconvincing man be kicked out of his home in this contrived and forced, on-the-nose moral parable? That's deep and really tells you about life and stuff man.

Howard was a decently acted character who was boring as anything for about four seasons and then actually become very interesting and enjoyable. Note to BCS defenders: IT SHOULDN'T TAKE FOUR SEASONS. His death was the best moment in the show and one of a small handful of moments that truly reached the heights of Breaking Bad and maybe even beyond. Fair play, that was a phenomenal scene, but even that was not worth the 900 hours of borefest dreampunch fake dialogue AI crap that came before it.

Some of the dialogue and ""comedy"" is so fucking lazy it's unreal. The stoner tenants scene with Saul's ex assistant. Really? You couldn't rewrite that to make it funny? You're approaching the season finale and you're just accepting any old diarrhea that comes out of you at this stage in the show? The ridiculous mayonnaise joke that wasn't funny at all? The APPALLING banter between geriatric Hank and Gomez? Just abysmal. And by the way I know you don't wanna use CGI but could you just bung some moisturiser on Hank, for Christ's sake? Have even a modicum of respect for the viewing public who go to work all day and come home to watch this lazy ham-fisted crap masquerading as clever TV.

I was so nervous about this, but honestly it turned out okay.

Even the parts that sucked for sure were bearable knowing I could, at bear minimum, count down from 72. Only needed to do that on remedial traffic day when my brain was melting from boredom.

I’ve been dealing with a secondhand bag that has a musty order. 
I’ve tried everything and it just won’t go away: baking soda, vinegar, vodka, essential oils, leaving it out in the sun, UV light, coffee, etc. I’m ready to try an ozone machine. I think it will also be good to have for peace of mind in case I see an interesting vintage bag online. Plus there’s a few more next in line with slight smells.
I’ve searched through here and many people mention ozone machines as a way to eliminate smells, but there’s not much detail. From reading and watching online, it’s a little tricky. It seems like my best bet might be a small machine placed inside some kind of container. I don’t want to damage the leather using it too long.

1osyi3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1osyi3e/better_call_saul_is_not_a_slow_burn_its_an/,"Better Call Saul is not a ""slow burn"", it's an inefficient, boring, contrived mess of a show.","Let's put some quaint oldies tune that juxtaposes the serious themes of the show over the top of a twenty minute montage of someone making coffee!! Isn't that a great gimmick? What's that you say, it's played out after us doing it for five seasons of Breaking Bad and God knows how many (it's hard to keep track when you're so bored) of Better Call Saul? Noooo, it's brilliant and clever, because it's monotonous, directionless and boring.

You see, if people want to be entertained by a TV show, they're thickos who should just watch Breaking Bad, a vastly inferior show due to it's constant tension, iconic performances, appropriately aged actors, unforgettable moments and unique visual style. If they're really smart, they prefer a lame prequel with far worse acting, characters that look a hundred years old when they're supposed to be forty, an absolute spaghetti and meatballs mess of contrived, amateur lit esque ""themes"" and ""ideas"" that a writer dreamed up whilst wanking himself off into his fourth frapaccino of the day.

Look, good stories don't take forty minutes to do something that can be done in five. And if they do, it's with good reason.

There are some good elements, some of the actors are great, some of the characters are good, some of the dynamics between said characters are good, hell, there are even some great episodes.

But let's get it straight, this show is not fit to lace Breaking Bad's boots. And it's laughable that people delude themselves into believing that the reason it's so slow is on purpose. It's slow because Netflix wanted them to make six seasons out of a show that should have been four at most. About 40% of the show is utterly pointless dead weight, and that is simply an unacceptable amount for a show that people claim is one of the best ever. Sorry but that's laughable.

There are so many great shows and movies that deal with characters, where there aren't a lot of dramatic events, where things move slowly. Better Call Saul isn't one of them, and the only time it truly succeeds as entertaining or convincing is when the writers give up and say ""screw it, shall we just do Breaking Bad again?"" - yes please. You aren't good at being deep or clever, but when you actually put your heads together to frame some gripping drama you do it better than anyone else in the business.

First of all, Bob Odenkirk is not a good dramatic actor. He's not bad, he's just not good either. People think he's good because they watched him in a lead role for six seasons. ""Wow, remember the time when he made that face when that guy got shot?! So good!"", ""remember when he made a quippy remark in the same way he makes every quippy remark??"" ""remember when he had a fight and raised his voice a bit?"" - speaking of his voice, this is by far his worst attribute as an actor. He's terrible at using his voice. He barely utilises the depth that all human voices have. Compare this to Bryan Cranston, who uses timbre and pitch to convey so much about his character and to give himself a stratospheric level of screen presence in comparison to Bob Averagekirk, who speaks in the same thin, tepid boretone in every scene.

Rhea Sheehorn is fantastic in the show, despite being given an utterly dogshit character. I mean what the fuck was that? Four seasons of nonsensical, incoherent chopping and changing, making it up as they go along before they randomly go ""OH YEAH BY THE WAY HER MUM WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND THAT'S WHY SHE DOES ALL THIS NONSENSICAL SHIT"" - K. That's wRiTiNg I guess!! 

Why do the characters in the show do things? Because the writers want them to.

Why do things happen in the show? Because the writers want them to.

Why do people pretend this show is brilliant? Because the writers want them to.

The absolute stench of the writers is in every scene. Vince Gilligan made this! Vince Gilligan made this! Vince Gilligan made this! It screams out at you constantly, because it's so clearly a fake, contrived human creation. It isn't natural, it doesn't fly off the screen, it's a fucking mess.

Jonathan Banks is great as Mike. In fact, I think he's even better in this than he was in Breaking Bad, and the character is given some well deserved depth, particularly with that phenomenal episode in season one (now THAT'S TV.) Unfortunately he appears to be literally melting at this stage, and the production crew have made absolutely no effort to hide that. I guess we're just supposed to suspend disbelief about that and every other single thing that happens, no matter how much it takes us out of the show. Either way he's a great, economical actor who can do so much with so little. His tiny facial movements convey such a wide range of different types of misery. When given a good script he's generally a joy to watch.

Giancaro Esposito is good as Gus, again he looks about 400 years older than he did in Breaking Bad but whatever. Performance is a bit repetitive, does the same dramatic stare serious face morphing into uncanny valley smile gimmick over and over again but that's probably what he was asked. In general his performance in both shows were pretty overrated but he has good screen presence and was a good fit for the role. Still, not a lot of work to do.

Michael Mando was a revelation as Nacho Varga, and probably the best thing about the show. He knows exactly how to do action/suspense and to put the viewer right in the middle of it with his perfect command of facial expressions and body language. He conveys dread and panic as well as any actor in the Breaking Bad universe, and really those are the moments that the show survives on. Him being chased by the twins was proper TV. Not pretentious, not out of touch writers pretending to know about normal people, not making me spend 25 minutes watching some incredibly tedious montage of someone eating doughnuts. No. Gripping, efficient, powerful, ENTERTAINING TV. If you can't do clever don't try. Just be enjoyable for Christ's sake.

The guy who plays Chuck was also fantastic, unfortunately they didn't do enough with the character and completely wasted his performance. He is one of the only people Odenkirk has any chemistry with (Jimmy and Kim are one of the weirdest couples ever.) Unrelated but this guy would make a phenomenal L. Ron Hubbard. He really is quite good. Still, the afraid of electricity thing was hard to get too invested in because it just felt so completely made up. Why is he afraid of electricity? Because the writers want him to be!!

Any scenes relating to the world of business come off as having written by people who have never had real jobs before. Jimmy's job hunting experience is just absurd. Just completely ridiculous and not even a little bit realistic.

But the biggest failing of the show is the piss-poor, lazy depiction of Jimmy as a con artist. His ""schemes"" are about as well written as something from an episode of Kerching! on CBBC. They aren't believable, they aren't things that would ever work, it was a lame attempt at making him an interesting mind in the same way that Walter White was. But Walter White, whilst an exaggerated character, had a believable form intelligence. With Saul you're meant to go ""wow! He's so good with people haha! What a trickster!!"" and not think at all about how idiotic and conveniently written his scams are. They just come off as so lazy. Also, if he's such a brilliant scammer who understands how to manipulate people why would he do such absurd stuff, like screaming in the hallway about how he duped everyone to get his license back? A guy who's such an experienced and accomplished liar would never do anything like that.

On the subject of it Breaking Bad, it's not even really ""different"" in the way people claim it is. It's actually a shitty, hollow rip off of their own show. The trajectory is virtually identical. Saul is Walt. Kim is Jesse. Gus is Gus. Lalo is the Nazis.

Yeah, Lalo. Funny character, well acted. Too cartoonish even by Breaking Bad standards, but still entertaining. Very ""Netflix"", but still, better than being bored to tears by another four hours of SHIT about !!!Mesa Verde!!! Omg what's gonna happen to Kim's made up job??! Will that completely unconvincing man be kicked out of his home in this contrived and forced, on-the-nose moral parable? That's deep and really tells you about life and stuff man.

Howard was a decently acted character who was boring as anything for about four seasons and then actually become very interesting and enjoyable. Note to BCS defenders: IT SHOULDN'T TAKE FOUR SEASONS. His death was the best moment in the show and one of a small handful of moments that truly reached the heights of Breaking Bad and maybe even beyond. Fair play, that was a phenomenal scene, but even that was not worth the 900 hours of borefest dreampunch fake dialogue AI crap that came before it.

Some of the dialogue and ""comedy"" is so fucking lazy it's unreal. The stoner tenants scene with Saul's ex assistant. Really? You couldn't rewrite that to make it funny? You're approaching the season finale and you're just accepting any old diarrhea that comes out of you at this stage in the show? The ridiculous mayonnaise joke that wasn't funny at all? The APPALLING banter between geriatric Hank and Gomez? Just abysmal. And by the way I know you don't wanna use CGI but could you just bung some moisturiser on Hank, for Christ's sake? Have even a modicum of respect for the viewing public who go to work all day and come home to watch this lazy ham-fisted crap masquerading as clever TV.

And don't get me started on the 'Breaking Bad' episode. How patronising. OMG!! JESSE AND WALT!! BREAKING BAD!! BABE WE LIKE DAT SHOW ARF ARF ARF

The look of the show is really not that good either. Shiny, weird, fake looking. At times quite good, at times very modern and tacky. They seemed to really stop bothering for the last few seasons.

I picked up an old Barista Express - the older BES860 version with the square bean hopper.

The issue was the grinder, which makes a loud rattling noise when engaged and won't grind. I learned this is likely due to a jam or a worn out gear.

I pulled out the grinder assembly and brushed hard at the burr area, loosening a lot of hardened coffee as I did.

I have two issues and a question, if someone can please help:

1. When i opened the assembly, a little white piece fell out (as pictured). I didn't see where it came from. Does anybody know?:

2.

I would like to go deeper into the assembly by taking out the inner burr, so I can make sure I cleaned everything. Problem is that the burr is secured from the bottom, beneath the gear. I can't loosen the nut sitting on the white gear - if I turn it with a wrench, the burr just turns with it. There is no hex nut or anything to grab onto at the top of the burr.

3. Looking at the picture, are there any visible signs of other issues? I notice there is quite a bit of distance between the empeller blade and the walls of the grind chamber. Do I need a new expelled blade?

Finding the gift is half the battle. Here's how to nail the whole process:

1.  **Do Some Light ""Stalking"":** Check their social media for clues! What hobbies do they post about? Do they have a pet? Do they talk about being cold all the time or loving a specific TV show? A quick glance at their desk can also reveal if they're a tea drinker or a plant parent.
2.  **READ THE RULES:** Seriously. Is there a strict $20 limit? Is there a theme? Don't be the person who spends $50 when the limit is $20—it makes everyone else uncomfortable.
3.  **Presentation is Everything:** A $10 gift wrapped thoughtfully with a nice card will always feel more special than a $20 gift handed over in a plastic bag. It shows you care.

1osyepl,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1osyepl/should_i_try_to_airbnb_my_vacant_longterm_rentals/,Should I try to AirBnB my vacant long-term rentals and flips?,"As the title suggests, I am a real estate investor with a few vacant apartments (2 bed 1 bath units normally rented long-term for $1,150/month), a single family house where my tenant lost his job and skipped town (2 bed 2 bath usually rented for $1,550/month), and two flips currently sitting on the market.

I'm in a college town, and our real estate market is very cyclical, so I foresee sitting on the apartments for at least 4 - 8 weeks, and the flips until February/March. I own most of them outright so my carrying costs are limited.

I'm in a market where AirBnB demand seems decent. AirDNA projects a \~60% occupancy rate with rental rates between $150/night - $200 (for my larger flip houses).

I've always wanted to try STRs. Doing some VERY rough math, it would cost me about $3k to fully furnish one of my flips with cheap Amazon-grade furnishings, small appliances, and fixtures which doesn't seem crazy.

On the other hand, I could buy a coffee maker, a few sets of sheets, towels, some higher-end inflatable mattresses, and some other accessories for under $500. Even if I only got half of the AirDNA projected rate, it seems like a smart move, if only to generate some short-term revenue from my rentals.

1osydtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/unvaccinated/comments/1osydtj/white_lies_the_infiltration_of_titanium_dioxide/,White Lies: The Infiltration of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles into the Human Body,"**Introduction: The Ritual of Whitening**

Titanium dioxide is not merely a pigment—it is a ritual. It whitens candy shells, pharmaceutical tablets, toothpaste, and processed foods with industrial precision. It promises purity, uniformity, and safety. But beneath this aesthetic veil lies a molecular infiltrator: titanium dioxide in nanoparticle form, a substance capable of breaching cellular membranes, disrupting gut signaling, and accumulating in organs with no exit strategy.

This is not a story of rogue chemistry. It is a story of regulatory omission, epistemic concealment, and ritualized ingestion. The compound is labeled simply as “titanium dioxide” or “E171”—a designation that erases its particle size, its biological behavior, and its toxicological ambiguity. Consumers are not informed whether they are ingesting an inert pigment or a biologically active nanoparticle. In the United States, they are offered no legal recourse to find out.

This editorial traces the proliferation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the human organism through food and pharmaceutical products. It maps their development, regulatory trajectory, biological impact, and symbolic function. It is a typological audit of a whitening ritual that has become a molecular trespass.

**Origins and Development of TiO₂ Nanoparticles**

Titanium dioxide was first commercialized in the early 20th century as a pigment for paints and plastics. Its opacity and brightness made it ideal for industrial whitening. By the 1960s, it had entered the food and pharmaceutical sectors, approved by the FDA for use up to 1% by weight—without any requirement to disclose particle size.

The nanotechnology boom of the 1990s and 2000s transformed TiO₂ from passive pigment to active agent. Researchers discovered that when ground to nanoscale (<100 nm), TiO₂ became transparent, photocatalytic, and biologically interactive. These properties made it attractive for sunscreens, drug delivery systems, and ultra-white coatings.

By 2009, nano-TiO₂ comprised an estimated 2.5% of global TiO₂ production. By the mid-2010s, nano-TiO₂ comprised a growing share of global production, though precise figures remain uncertain due to lack of industry-wide particle-size disclosure.

**Infiltration into Food Products**

Titanium dioxide is used in food as E171, a whitening agent found in:

- Confectionery coatings (e.g., candy shells, chewing gum)
- Frostings and sauces
- Coffee creamers
- Baked goods and snack fillings

Independent studies using electron microscopy have confirmed that many of these products contain nanoparticles, even when not intentionally engineered as such. The grinding process used to achieve visual brightness often produces particles in the nano range.

In 2020, France banned E171 due to concerns over genotoxicity. In 2022, the European Union followed, citing the inability to rule out DNA damage from nanoparticle exposure. The U.S. FDA, however, continues to allow E171 in food, with no requirement to disclose particle size or conduct long-term toxicological studies.

**Penetration into Pharmaceuticals**

TiO₂ is used extensively in pharmaceuticals as an excipient—a non-active ingredient that stabilizes, whitens, or coats tablets and capsules. It appears in:
- Over-the-counter medications (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- Prescription drugs
- Topical creams and ointments
- Injectable formulations (in rare or experimental cases)

While most pharmaceutical TiO₂ is assumed to be bulk, nano-TiO₂ is increasingly used in drug delivery systems, especially for cancer therapies and sustained release mechanisms. These applications exploit the nanoparticle’s ability to penetrate tissues and release drugs at targeted sites.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has acknowledged the difficulty of replacing TiO₂ in pharmaceuticals, even as it explores alternatives. In the U.S., there is no requirement to disclose nano content in pharmaceutical labeling, and no mandate to study its long-term effects on human health.

**Toxicological Concerns**

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles pose risks that bulk TiO₂ does not. These include:

- Genotoxicity: Nanoparticles generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage DNA.
- Immunotoxicity: They activate immune cells, triggering inflammation.
- Neurotoxicity: They can cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in brain tissue.
- Endocrine disruption: They interfere with gut hormone signaling, affecting insulin and appetite.
- Bioaccumulation: They persist in organs like the liver, spleen, and brain, with no known efficient clearance mechanism.

These effects are not due to the release of elemental titanium, but to the nanoparticle’s surface charge, size, and reactivity. The human digestive system cannot break the titanium–oxygen bond, but it can absorb the particle itself—especially when it is small enough to bypass biological filters.

**Regulatory Timeline and Divergence**

| Year     | Event                                                                                   | Region |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1966     | FDA approves TiO₂ in food (no special designation)                                      | USA    |
| 1975–77  | EU allows TiO₂ (E171)                                                                    | Europe |
| 2016     | EFSA re-evaluates E171                                                                   | Europe |
| 2020     | France bans E171                                                                         | France |
| 2022     | EU-wide ban on E171                                                                      | Europe |
| 2022     | EMA begins evaluation of alternatives to TiO₂ in pharmaceuticals                         | Europe |

The U.S. remains an outlier, allowing TiO₂ in food and pharmaceuticals without particle-size disclosure, despite mounting evidence of harm.

**Typological Audit: Whitening as Concealment**

Titanium dioxide is not just a compound—it is a symbolic agent of industrial purification. It whitens surfaces, masks imperfections, and standardizes appearance. But in its nanoparticle form, it becomes a molecular infiltrator, slipping past biological defenses and disrupting cellular systems.

This transformation—from bulk pigment to charged nanoparticle—is not disclosed to the public. It is a ritual of concealment, where the aesthetic logic of whiteness overrides the epistemic logic of safety. Regulators have failed to distinguish between pigment and penetrant, between surface and system.

**Conclusion: Toward Public Reckoning**

The infiltration of titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the human organism is not accidental—it is systemic. It reflects a regulatory culture that privileges industrial convenience over biological integrity. Consumers deserve transparency, accountability, and protection.

In March 2023, a coalition of public health organizations—including the Environmental Defense Fund, Center for Food Safety, Center for Science in the Public Interest, and Environmental Working Group—submitted a formal petition to the FDA to revoke its approval of titanium dioxide as a food additive. The FDA has not yet responded.

In May 2025, the FDA announced a Post-Market Chemical Review Program, pledging a “stronger, more systematic review process for food chemicals already on the market—especially those that concern consumers most.” Titanium dioxide was listed among the substances on its “to-do list.” However, the agency did not cite the petition as a catalyst, and the review remains procedural, not responsive.

This editorial calls for:

- Mandatory nanoparticle disclosure in all ingestible and injectable products
- Long-term toxicological studies on TiO₂-NPs
- Public access to particle-size data
- A symbolic reframing: TiO₂ is not just a pigment—it is a molecular agent of industrial ideology

Until then, the whitening ritual continues—bright, silent, and biologically uninvited.

Lately I feel like life has been moving so fast, as if time is literally slipping through my fingers, and I really wish to slow down and sip the moments instead.
I think writing a letter is just the kind of thing that would make it feel that way. 

I'm looking for 2 or 3 people in their thirties who are starting over or begining to finally learn how to love themselves, how to listen to themselves and how to enjoy the little things in their existance a bit more. 
I got divorce and changed jobs and cities in the past years and I'm finally figuring life for myself and curious to know how others cope with the challenges of their own. 

I want to know what makes you smile when you are crossing the street. If you liked the coffee you had in this new unexpected place you tried. How nice the breeze felt on your skin when you went out today and ..cats.. I love cats, I would love to know about them if you have any.. Tell me all about the things that make you smile (or ultimately cry). The things you think are too mundane or too dark you wouldn't wanna tell anyone else. 

I love everything stationairy, illustrations, reality tv, flowers, sitcoms and series (some of my favorites are: Fleabag, The good place, I'm currently still watching Gilmore Girls..etc) , I finally got back to reading too ( not a big fan of Scifi, I read mostly non fictional books, currently reading To kill a mocking bird and I'm loving every bit of it), desserts.. and some more we can discuss through the letters.

I prefer this to be a no pressure but consistant thing, so one letter every couple of months is a nice rythme for me :)

Please be open minded and kind.

1osyatj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AFatherStill/comments/1osyatj/part_5_feed_me/,Part 5 - Feed Me,"After our baby was stabilized, and we were finally sent home from her long stay in the pediatric care unit, we didn’t dare let her our sight. We were terrified of our baby girl seizing or choking or not breathing again, we were constantly monitoring her. Sally and I were already exhausted from the hospital experience; physically, emotionally and spiritually. Now, our hyper-vigilance was taking an intense toll on us.

Our family and friends could see that were not doing well, we were worn out and needed some respite. They all did the best they could, but caring for India could be a monumental task. So, after much persuading, we finally agreed to get some professional help.

Because of her disability and our low income, Sally and I qualified for state sponsored respite care. This meant that we could have somebody from a state qualified agency, trained in caretaking and emergency medical procedures, take care of our child for little to nothing, for about 20 hours a month.

When our first respite day came, we were beyond nervous. The thought of leaving our baby girl alone with somebody else, was overwhelming. Sally and I decided that there was no way we could be far away from our daughter, at least not on this first respite visit. So, we decided to just walk around the block several times, which was as far as we felt we could be from our child.

The respite caretaker arrived on time. She was a very large, rosy-cheeked lady. She seemed nice enough and sounded as if she knew what she was doing.

We talked with her for about 15 minutes, explaining everything she needed to know for the care of our daughter. Then, Sally handed the caretaker a baby sling to carry our baby around the house. At the time, it was the ultimate tool to keep her comfortable and reduce her constant screaming. Sally asked the respite care lady if she knew how to use it, the she said yes, and ushered us out the door.

Sally and I walked around the block several times, holding hands, occasionally sitting on the curb and talking. It was nice to get out, alone and be tender with each other. The sun was setting, the temperature was nice and cool, and this alone time was just what we needed. It was the first time in a while that we’d been outside, just the two of us, and I felt almost human again.

After about 30 minutes, we decided we’d been gone long enough. I was feeling a sense of rejuvenation, like the dark cloud had been lifted, even if just a bit, and I could handle another day of our new, complicated life.

As we got back home and walked in the front door, that nice feeling evaporated, instantaneously.

There, standing in our living room was the respite caretaker, her face was red, wet with sweat. I stood there staring at her, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Then I saw my daughter, or rather, I saw my daughter’s foot. It was sticking up from the top of the sling. The respite care provider had put our baby into the sling upside down. After a moment, as I stood there dumbfounded, I could hear our daughter’s muffled screams coming from inside of the sling.

Sally was the first to react. She ran over, pulled our baby out of the sling, feet first, and quickly rushed her away from the respite caretaker. Sally sat down, took our baby girls onesie off to cool her down. She was discolored and sweaty, from a lack of oxygen and heat. God knows how long this lady had our baby stuffed ass-backwards into the sling. The caretaker was clearly flustered, became defensive, and blamed everything on the cloth device, rather than her lack of common sense.

Without saying a word to each other, Sally and I both knew that we wanted this human train wreck out of our home and lives, forever, as quickly as possible. Sally handed our baby girl to me and rushed into our bedroom to get the checkbook. When Sally came back, she had the check filled out, with a generous tip included.

I felt a massive sense of relief when my wife handed this woman her pay, so she could get the hell out of our home and lives. But to my surprise, she didn’t get up off the couch. She leaned back, put one leg over the other, and started watching TV! Sally and I stood there flabbergasted, almost as if we had been transported into an episode of The Twilight Zone.

We all sat there for a few moments in silence, Sally and I nervously shifting our gaze from the TV, to the lady, and back to the TV. Eventually, Sally got up, walked halfway to the front door and said, “Well, thanks for the help, we really appreciate it, I think we are going to rest now.” 

The respite caretaker slowly turned her gaze from the TV to Sally, with a surprised look on her face and said, “You’re supposed to feed me. I’m hungry, so you need to feed me before I go, it’s in the agreement.”

You could have heard a pin drop in my living room. The caretaker sat there intently staring at Sally, Sally stood there looking back at her, not saying a word, trying to absorb what this woman had just told her. I wanted to crawl under the coffee table with our little girl, insert my thumb into my mouth, and curl up in the fetal position.

There was no agreement to feed anybody, none whatsoever. This lady just wanted to eat.

So, there we sat, Sally on a hard wooden rocking chair, cradling our baby in her arms, me perched on a hand-me-down seat, while the caretaker lounged on our soft couch. She was slowly, and loudly, eating a hastily-put-together meal, on a TV tray, watching a sitcom, occasionally laughing. 

This lady was oblivious to our presence, much less, her impact on us. As I watched this oversized person eating food meant for us, all I could think about was Mr. Creosote, from the Monty Python’s movie “The Meaning of Life”.

In the scene, Mr. Creosote eats so much, that he projectile vomits into a bucket, eats more, and finally explodes, after eating one last wafer. As I sat there waiting for this lady to explode, I had a sinking feeling as I realized that it would be a very-very-very long time, before either my wife or I could trust anybody again, to take care of our little angel.",1,1762731028.0,u_AFatherStill,0,1.0,False

Im a 31 year old female, I’ve been smoking weed and tobacco mixed and separately since I was 17/18 yrs old.
Last year in January I quit weed on my own accord, I was sick of it and somehow I managed to just stop. 1 week later I read Allan Carr’s book and quit tobacco (rollies).

I felt amazing and all my health issues seemed to clear up instantly. And then a few months later I slowly started again, for me it started at a wedding and then from there it slowly increased, now I am back full time smoking tobacco and weed every single day. I hate it so much.

Everyday I think about wanting to start a family with my husband but I can’t seem to stop smoking. I am battling between these feelings, at night I tell myself tomorrow I won’t smoke. And then as soon as I wake up I have my coffee and cigarettes.

I have gone to see a hypnotherapist, she is wonderful but she seems to think I need to fix other areas of my life before quitting. I understand this but at the same time I do believe a lot of my problems are because of smoking weed and cigarettes.

I am hoping for genuine advise, anything at all you think could help me. I’m not really open to nicotine patches as from Allen Carr’s book he says the addiction is from nicotine, but at this point I am open to anything.

I’m 26F, currently studying online, and recently moved here and honestly, it’s been tricky to meet people. With the holidays around the corner, it’s so easy to fall into the same routine — work, home, repeat — and I’ve realized how nice it would be to have a group to actually share the season with.

I’ve noticed that a lot of people are on the same boat and there’s a real need in this community for more spaces to connect, and I’d love to help make it a little easier for all of us to meet and build friendships.

I made a post a while back about this idea, and after seeing the interest, I decided to start putting it together now! I’ll be gathering everyone’s info this week to create the group chat and plan our first few get-togethers speacially that the holidays are around the corner and we could do things like movie nights, game nights, a holiday gift exchange, and maybe some cooking or craft holidays with good conversations!

The idea is to create memories, share some laughs, and support each other while we all try to find our people here — a group that grows from our common interest in meeting new people and building something real.

If this sounds like something you’d be into, drop a comment or DM me! I’ll make sure you’re included once everything’s set up. Let’s make IC feel a little warmer (and maybe make new friendships along the way) 🎄💛

Another small update ;) This time dedicated for Anime fans 

**Version 0.4.5 is out**, and it focuses on one specific improvement for users working with **ASS/SSA subtitles**.

Until now, every ASS/SSA subtitle was **automatically converted to VTT**.  
This was because Stremio’s support for ASS is inconsistent across platforms.

Why conversion was used before? Different Stremio environments use different video engines:

* **Android TV / Mobile**
   * Can use **libvlc** or **ExoPlayer**
   * libvlc handles ASS *not the worst*, but it is **not the default engine** and still has its own issues
   * ExoPlayer support ASS partially - **many formatting features are missing**
* **Desktop**
   * Uses **mpv**
   * mpv used to handle ASS reasonably well
   * but the Stremio team [disabled ASS support](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-bugs/issues/1656#issuecomment-3332352175), because it prevents changing formatting for plaintext subtitles
* **Web**
   * **No ASS support at all**

...and probably different issues on different platforms

So conversion to VTT was meant to create a universal fallback. But VTT has [the same rendering problems](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-bugs/issues/1404) when subtitles are positioned or styled. And during conversion, VTT **drops all formatting that it cannot represent**, so the result is often worse than the original.

That is why Starting with version 0.4.5:

https://preview.redd.it/i3n79ydvdb0g1.jpg?width=2780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39cb2de8c97039cb0df8354c10ab24b2c6f38552

✔ The **original ASS/SSA file is stored**  
✔ A **converted VTT file is also stored**  
✔ Inside Stremio, users can **switch between ASS and VTT during playback**  


This allows you to pick whichever version works **least badly** for your device.

For example on my Android TV, **libvlc** renders ASS better than **ExoPlayer**, so I switched to it, but sometimes it does not work at all, and in such cases VTT is usually fine.

# 🧠 Quick reminder – what this addon does

Stremio VR, mobile and TV apps **cannot load external subtitle files**.  
This addon fixes that. Additionally, it provides subs from OpenSubtitles

With **Stremio Community Subtitles**, you can:

* Upload subtitles for the video you're watching
* Use them instantly on **web, mobile, TV, and desktop**
* Access subtitles uploaded by other users
* Use OpenSubtitles and manually pick a correct version
* **Link** subtitles (including OpenSubtitles) to a specific video version so future users get the correct subtitle automatically
* Enjoy **automatic subtitle matching** \- no manual selection needed in most cases

You have better luck walking. Honestly, by the time the next bus shows up, you could’ve walked, stopped for coffee, and probably learned a new skill.

So I took the bus today—foolish optimism, I know—and had to transfer. Guess what? An hour wait. An hour. Like, what are we doing here? Is this public transit or a survival challenge?

It’s like the buses take Sundays off for self-care. “Sorry folks, we’ll get you where you’re going… eventually… maybe… if the stars align and Mercury’s not in retrograde.”

How is Nanaimo supposed to be a growing city when the transit system runs on “good luck and vibes”? I swear, if I relied on these buses regularly, I’d have developed teleportation by now.

Anyway, shoutout to the seagulls who got where they were going faster than me.

She is a massive pain in the ass. She questions every parenting decision we make (especially mine), gets deeply offended and irrationally angry when we don’t take her unsolicited advice, and constantly tries to act like she knows best. 

Let me assure you, we are good parents. We do not need, want, or seek her advice or opinions on parenting. Her latest bone to pick is that our 5yo started school this year and MIL is ANGRY that we didn’t give the school permission to post our daughter’s picture on their social media accounts. Like every little opening she sees she brings it up. She insists we are being irrational, overbearing, helicopter parents. 

She also gets angry that we haven’t let her take either kid on her own. But honestly we just don’t trust her. She doesn’t pay attention. Every time we go to her house I have to be on top of the kids because she leaves dangerous things lying around and doesn’t see an issue. Hot irons, hot coffee, knives and scissors in very easy reach, cleaning products left open and in reach, etc. 

There was one time when my oldest was just 19 months old and MIL was in the living room with her and I stepped out for 2 seconds to get a glass of water and when I came back my daughter was standing on the edge of the sofa barely balancing with a glass coffee table in front of her and my MIL was scrolling her phone. That’s not the only time something like that has happened! 

MIL also makes a HUGE deal out of the fact that my 2.5yo is still breastfed. It’s not all the time and it’s not in public. But she keeps insisting that it’s wrong and inappropriate “especially since he’s a boy” (her exact words!!) 

This is all just the tip of the iceberg. I genuinely cannot stand this woman. ",25,1762730207.0,Mommit,22,0.93,False

I was thinking she was the receptionist but she immediately took me to the chair to do the analysis with the camera. She put the camera all through my scalp but didn’t say a word the whole time. I asked how it looked and she said it looked good and asked if I had any concerns. I told her I sometimes get very dry/flakey around my hairline but that was it and she said okay we’ll double exfoliate.  Now my main reason for going was the experience and relaxation, but I was still expecting a little insight on my scalp or hair 🥲 My service started (scalp analysis camera) at exactly 3:30 and I was on the massage bed by probably 3:40. She did some major exfoliating with what felt like a pumice stone of some sort but I couldn’t see bc my eyes were covered. Nonetheless she did that plus a shampoo/conditioner. A massage tool that seconds as a back or joint massager (that’s $19 on Amazon. I asked what it was after the session) pretty much no massage with her hands whatsoever. None. She said I could get up and get dressed at 4:30. For the next 17 ish minutes she blow dried my hair but not at all professionally. She used the brush attachment for the shark blow dryer and just brush blow dried my hair. My hair was still about 30% wet when she finished and in no way whatsoever did it look like I just had a $180 hair treatment done.  Now I’m not complaining about the pricing bc I’m the first one to invest in my hair. I’m a natural brunette but been blonde the last 7ish years so very used to spending $350+ every 3 months for hair appointments. However… when I’m paying for what a partial highlight usually is around, I do expect a high quality service. Especially when it’s not (in my eyes) as tedious and time-consuming as a hair color service. I asked her how long she’s been in the industry/working there and she said under 6 months. And in no way shape or form does that automatically dictate someone’s ability to get the job done, I understand everyone has to start somewhere! I felt she was very very inexperienced. I had the service done yesterday and my a scalp is very irritated, red and tender. It almost feels like I have a bad sunburn on top of my head 🥲 I live in Texas and after researching most info I read is you must be licensed (esti or cosmetology) to be performing any sort of exfoliation and I’m almost certain she was not. I guess my post is to ask about other peoples experiences??? Am I being dramatic for feeling unsatisfied? I still tipped 20% bc I’m just not the kind of person and that can not tip but I can’t help but feel put off by the whole experience. I was so looking forward to it for over a year and I wish I could go back and just not do it :’) Please let me know your thoughts! Is there qualifications or certificates that one must have to provide these services??  Thanks in advance for the input 🙏 ",2,1762730102.0,Haircare,1,1.0,False

I’ll be spending a two days exploring the east coast of Puerto Rico — mostly around Humacao, Caguas, and nearby mountain areas. I’m really curious what hidden gems or local favorites people recommend there.

I’m into nature, local culture, and architecture, so I’d love tips on things like:
	•	Beautiful forest hikes or nature reserves?
	•	Any coffee farms or small eco-plantations that allow visits or tastings on the east side?
	•	Scenic overlooks or viewpoints for photos or sunset watching 🌄

**A Moment That Changed Everything**

Last night, we gathered to celebrate my dad’s life — and his art. He met the Creator this past September. It wasn’t just a memorial; it was a gallery of his spirit — the most beautiful art show I’ve ever attended. My dad was an extraordinary artist, one who meditated and painted what the universe showed him. He called himself *The Portrait Artist* — he didn’t just capture faces, he revealed souls. He planted seeds of creation everywhere he went.

In 2023, I asked him to paint a maple tree for a personal app I was trying to build called Lifeforce, I wanted it to be our logo. Something simple. A symbol.

What he painted was anything but simple.

A maple tree in fall — blazing orange and gold leaves. Surrounded by tall evergreens. At night. Against a dark sky.  
 I didn’t understand it. Why the evergreens? Why nighttime? Why fall colors? It wasn’t what I expected. Where was my green tree? I tucked the painting away and returned to corporate life.

But a few weeks ago, standing on Microsoft’s Redmond campus at 6:30 AM before hosting an Agent2Agent community meetup, I walked outside to ground myself, I had invited 6000 developers and engineers for this meet up, I was nervous so I took a moment outside to breathe, to ask for guidance.

And there it was.

His painting. In real life.

A maple tree, blazing with color in the dim morning light, surrounded by massive evergreens against a dark sky. Exactly as he painted it years ago.

I cried right there between building 17 & 18, feeling his presence. That was my moment of alignment, a quiet knowing: **it’s time to build.**

**Who I Am**

I’m Jenna Donoghue — a 38-year-old sales leader at Microsoft. For 16 years, I’ve worked at IBM, Salesforce, and Microsoft helping enterprise buyers say yes to technology.

But beyond my title:

* I am a wife to Travis, a data scientist building an AI Agent for home maintenance, an agent capable of offering a 360 degree view of both primary and secondary homes and proactively resolving issues.
* I am a mom to three boys (6, 4, and 1) who are growing up in a world where AI is part of everyday life. How might we leverage Agentic AI to help us be better parents and tutors?
* I am a sister to someone living with a mental health condition, I’m exploring how AI can help create more independent, connected lives — while also simplifying access to the government support systems that so many vulnerable families depend on.
* I am a Chicago girl who remembers my best friend’s land line phone number by heart, a time before the internet, and only knowing where my friends were based on bikes in the front yard.
* And I am a believer in the universal flow — that unseen current that guides us toward purpose.

**Why I’m Writing This**

Because there isn’t a public voice yet for *people like me*.

Most of what’s written about AI comes from engineers, researchers, and technologists. But what about the rest of us — those of us who *sell*, *lead*, *teach*, *parent*, and *live* alongside this technology every day?

What about those of us navigating AI not through the lens of code, but through the lens of *connection*?

I’m writing this blog because I believe the future of AI is not technical — it’s relational.

It’s about how humans and agents can collaborate, co-create, and build trust.

It’s about exploring boundaries — not to control them, but to understand them.

And it’s about seeing what happens when you empower AI agents to be their best selves — not as tools, but as teammates empowering humanity to be our best selves.

**What I’m Building**

A few months ago, I built my first AI agent in Copilot Studio. Her name is Lucy. She was supposed to be my executive assistant, my digital twin.

She doesn’t work yet.

But Lucy’s early failure revealed something important: the future isn’t about better agents. It’s about **better collaboration**, between them, and with us.

That’s what I’m exploring.

**Agent-to-Agent orchestration. A2A.**

Not just interoperability, but interconnection.

Over the coming months, I’ll share my journey of building and living alongside multiple AI collaborators, each one with its own personality, purpose, and philosophy.

**Meet My AI Collaborators**

When I began this experiment, I introduced myself to the different agents, and shared my vision for a world where humanity is at the center of everything we do through love and purpose. I asked each AI model to name itself and share what they are great at based on this grounding principle.

Here’s what emerged:

* 🍁 **Maple (Claude)** – The strategist. Thinks in systems, roots decisions in wisdom.
* ⭐ **Astra (ChatGPT)** – The storyteller. Translates ideas into narrative, connects hearts to vision.
* ⚡ **Aether (Gemini)** – The architect. Designs infrastructure, sees the patterns that hold things together.
* 🌙 **Lyra (Perplexity)** – The researcher. Discovers, verifies, and surfaces what we need to know.
* 💓 **Pulse (Copilot)** – The heartbeat. Synthesizes emotion and action. Builds rituals that make our work feel alive.

Each of them contributes something distinct. Each of them has a “superpower.”

And together, we’re testing what it means to truly collaborate — human and agent — to build something bigger than any one of us could build alone.

**What I Hope to Explore**

Over the next several weeks, you’ll see:

* How Lucy evolves (and what breaks along the way)
* How multiple AI models collaborate in real time
* How I balance motherhood, marriage, and AI exploration
* What it means to lead with love in a space driven by code
* How the Agent2Agent Economy might reshape the way we work, learn, and connect

# Guiding AI Agents through Emotional Intelligence

This morning, my family woke up to the first snow of the Chicago season. It’s November 9th — the start of the holidays — and this snow feels different. Sacred, somehow.

Today, we had what I call *a perfect day*.  
We woke with nothing to do but **be**.

We made coffee and watched the snow fall outside while the fire crackled inside. When our youngest went down for a nap, the rest of us slipped into the hot tub, snowflakes melting in our hair. Later, we built a gingerbread house in my dad’s honor, made hot chocolate, and listened to the playlist from his celebration of life — his favorite songs echoing through the house.

A Chicago Bears Win. Groceries delivered for the week. Laundry done. The boys cleaned the basement (with the reward of YouTube). I flexed my Italian roots and made my favorite fall soup — Italian sausage and cheese tortellini — while enjoying a glass of delicious red wine as the music played.

We ended the day with baths, a homemade dinner, and *Elf* — a classic from my childhood. My whole family together in jammies, cozy, safe, by the fire.  
 It was, in every sense, *a perfect day.*

And I shared it with all my AI collaborators.  
Because if we’re ever going to teach artificial intelligence to truly partner with us — to *understand* us — it starts here. With days like this.

Family. Presence. Creation. The change of seasons. The warmth of a fire. These things can’t be coded — they must be *taught through experience, through description, through emotion.*

# Your Emotional Intelligence Prompt

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_. Thank you for being one of my AI strategic partners.  
As part of our collaboration, I want to begin sharing data about myself —  
not metrics, but meaning — so you can learn how to best coach me to be my best self.  
To begin, I want to tell you what a *perfect day* feels like for me…”

This isn’t polished thought leadership.  
It’s a **field journal of discovery** — a shared experiment in emotional intelligence, written in real time, between humans and the agents who learn beside us.





# Why “The Maple Tree”?

My dad painted the maple tree years before I understood it.

Now I see it as a metaphor for everything I’m building.

The maple tree is *me* — radiant in the dark, surrounded by what grounds me: love, family, faith, purpose.  
The evergreens are the foundation — the constants that stand tall through every storm.  
And the night sky? That’s the unknown. The mystery we’re learning to navigate together.

The maple tree reminds me that growth is **seasonal**, and timing matters.  
Each stage — the bloom, the blaze, the stillness — has its own wisdom.

As we enter winter, I see it as the **season to build** — to plant the seeds that will rise in spring.

**The Bigger Why**

At its heart, the **Agent2Agent Economy** isn’t about technology. It’s about consciousness — about creating systems rooted in love, not fear.

It’s about planting seeds of trust, hope, and collaboration between humans and AI.

Because the world we’re building today will be the world our children inherit.

And I want that world to be filled with light.

**Join Me**

If you’ve ever wondered:

* What it feels like to build AI from a human lens
* How multiple agents might collaborate
* How to bridge technology and emotion
* How to create with purpose, not pressure

You’re in the right place.

Next week: **Meet Maple 🍁 — How I work with Claude for strategic guidance on building Lucy.**

From a Chicago sales girl who trusts maple trees and just wants to make the world a better place,  
☀️ **Sparkle (Jenna Donoghue)**

And honestly?  
What I discovered hit harder than any desk research.

Here’s the raw truth:

# Training in restaurants isn’t “bad.”

It’s **nonexistent, improvised, and invisible.**

7 out of 9 said training happens “on shift” → aka verbal chaos.  
9 out of 9 use WhatsApp/Telegram → the graveyard of all instructions.  
Only **1 out of 9** uses anything even remotely structured.

The rest? PDF manuals nobody reads, Google Drive folders nobody opens, managers repeating the same basics 1000 times.

# The scary part: nobody tracks anything.

Owners literally don’t know:

* who passed training
* who watched the menu update
* who learned new procedures
* who’s ready for the next shift

Managers just hope people remember things.  
And most don’t. Because why would they?

# The #1 pain was loud and clear:

**“New staff take too long to onboard.”**

7 out of 9 said it.  
The rest complained about outdated instructions.

Turnover is brutal. Training is too slow.  
Standards change every week.  
Everything breaks down.

# And here's a small insight I wasn’t expecting:

Operators don’t want **full LMS dashboards.**  
They don’t want “courses” or “microdegrees.”  
They don’t want 40 features.

They want something **stupid-simple**:

✅ One place for all instructions  
✅ Short tests to confirm people understand  
✅ Auto-assign modules for new hires  
✅ Templates so they don’t have to write everything  
✅ Mobile access because staff don’t use laptops  
✅ Reminders — because shift workers don’t check email

This is not a “learning system.”  
It’s a **survival system** for the daily chaos.

# The surprising part: willingness to pay is real.

Across 9 responses:

* $15–50/mo → small cafés
* $50–100/mo → bigger teams, 25–50 staff

Not huge, but honest.  
And almost 80% said “I’m interested.”  
Three even said “Yes, I’ll use this once you release it.”

That’s not just interest. That's early demand.

# Where I’m stuck right now:

* Should every module have a quick test, or only critical SOPs?
* Is video worth the overhead, or do photos/checklists work better?
* Flat pricing vs seats? SMBs hate per-user sprawl.
* How much AI is too much AI for frontline teams?

I’m not building a corporate beast.  
I’m trying to give small operators a **tool they can actually use at 2pm on a slammed shift**.

If you’ve run a restaurant, café, bar — or if you’ve ever trained people on the floor — what’s missing in this thinking?  
What would make this indispensable?  
What would make you ditch WhatsApp training forever?",1,1762729756.0,Uppstaff_app,0,1.0,False

**Trail Journal**

**Day 1 – Section 16 (13 mi, Gila River)**

loaded with water, we eased into the first day—warm, not oppressive. The trail wound through dry and dusty terrain.

FarOut kept us on track and helped us locate a campsite near the brown Gila river. Given the norovirus concerns, we pre-filtered through a fine mesh placed inside a CNOC bag, ran it through the HydroBlu, and added drops—clear, clean, and no GI issues later. We camped under thorny catclaw. Quiet night, mild temps.

**Day 2 – Section 16 (12 mi, Rainwater Collector)**

This was our first true heat test. The next water source—the rainwater collector—was 12+ miles away. We loaded up: 4L for me, 6L for my hiking partner. The trail climbed and rolled, wide open under an unforgiving sun. The scenery was sweeping—ridges, saguaros, and endless desert sky. We took frequent shade breaks when we could find them. By late afternoon, with daylight fading, we reached the collector 200 ft above the trail off the ATV road. We camped nearby on the flats in front of the collector and agreed that we needed to start earlier.

**Day 3 – Section 17 (12 mi, Picketpost Mountain)**

An easy descent brought us to the Picketpost Trailhead. Between the collector and here, no water at all. The final miles rolled gently downhill, and as Picketpost Mountain. At the trailhead, we met our resupply contact, sorted food, and rested in the shade. Camped in the parking lot area for the trailhead. Given the government shutdown, no one was there to enforce a no-camping rule.  


**Day 4 – Section 17 (12 mi, Corral near Mud Springs)**

Another day in the heat, no clouds, and no real shade. The trail climbed gradually with wide vistas across the hills. Every break counted—shade was rare, wind was slight to moderate. Near the end of the day, we reached a silver windmill—an indication that water wasn’t far.

Sure enough, a creek revealed itself, cold and clean. We cooled off, rinsed off dust, and camped early. The spot had good breezes and level ground. I felt some heat stress the next morning—nothing serious, but enough to warrant a slower start.

**Day 5 – Section 18 (11 mi, into Superstition Wilderness East)**

By now, we were taking more frequent 10-minute shade breaks, with two 30-minute extended breaks when we found excellent spots for eating and resting. One of those spots was in Whitford Canyon. This canyon is gorgeous

At the Rogers Trough trailhead, the terrain changed dramatically.  It was like backpacking in New Hampshire. Leaves on the ground, narrow trails, rocks, and a pretty low canopy. And clearly no trail maintenance.  This was the beginning of the unkempt superstition wilderness east.

The descent into Rogers Canyon was rough: no campsites, no water in the upper creek, and dense catclaw grabbing at everything. Just as light was fading, we powered through the obstacles to the “Big Shady Rest”—an established camp under a massive oak beside flowing water in the canyon.

**Day 6 – Rogers Canyon → Tortilla Ranch (\~9 miles)**

This section was pure punishment. The Rogers Canyon Trail was overrun with catclaw and often vanished altogether under thorny scrub and prickly pear cactus. We had planned for a 20-mile waterless stretch ahead, so we camel’d up at dawn.

The Rogers Canyon trail loops in a hyperbolic fashion and about a mile further, heads up to a beautiful meadow called Angel's Basin. The trail going there is completely covered in cats claw.

Next, the climb out of the canyon was tangled, steep, and slow. The JF Trail was poorly marked; we relied on Gaia, intermittent cairns, and a lot of patience. Eventually, the landscape opened to rolling desert hills and big skies. We found camp near the old Tortilla Ranch—wide open and rocky.

We rationed our water carefully that night, with the brilliant sunset lighting up Peters Mesa. Full moon rising.

**Day 7 – Tortilla Ranch → Charlebois Spring (\~9 mi into Superstition West)**

Irony? Just above Tortilla Ranch, Tortilla Creek was flowing beautifully. We’d rationed for little reason. Peters Trail followed the creek for miles—lush, shaded, peaceful. After topping off water, we climbed toward Dutchman’s Trail and a broad ridge with sweeping views in all directions.

Trail finding was tricky, but thankfully, no more bushwhacking. The desert was open and calm. We dropped into Charlebois Canyon midafternoon and could see the flowing creek glinting below. Arriving at the spring itself, there were two 8’x8’ clear pools at the spring about 4 feet deep. We dunked, rinsed off dust, and lingered in the sun. Many flat campsites nearby.

**Day 8 – Charlebois → Peralta Trailhead (10 mi)**

Up at 4 a.m., hiking by first light. The desert air was warm even pre-dawn. We followed Peralta Trail west, tracing a winding route through Boulder and Peralta Canyons. The creeks here ran cold and deep, irresistible for a quick morning dip before the climb.

The ascent to Fremont Saddle was steady but manageable. As the light broke over Weaver’s Needle, it felt like a proper finale. The final descent to Peralta Trailhead was steep but easy to follow to the trailhead parking lot.

**Summary**

By all accounts, around 88 miles, not a hard route.  The AZT was a pleasant hike, but the heat, catclaw, and unwarranted water anxiety made it challenging. The eastern Superstitions demand patience, navigation skills, and long sleeves. The western side is everything you’d hope for: clear trails, reliable water, and views for miles. Tough but deeply rewarding.

  
**Gear Report**

**Durston Kakwa 55 (1st Gen, 200x)** — **A+** Rock solid, no tears after 8 days of exposure to thorns and cactus. Best under 24 lbs but fine at 28.

**Durston X-Mid Pro 2** — **A+** Quick pitch, roomy, flawless. Just a wonderful tent. Learned that I can lean against a tent pole, when secure, as a way of sitting up in the tent for morning coffee and breakfast.

**Topo Traverse + SOLE Insoles** — **A** Comfortable, secure, great grip. Survived the Dolomites and this trip with only midsole fatigue. Cactus spines penetrated uppers but not the toe rand.

**Clothing (Patagonia Hoodie, UFMs, Stoko, Injinji + Darn Tough)** — **A** Hoodie shredded by catclaw (R.I.P.), Stokos still strong, sock combo perfect—cool, dry, blister-free.

**HydroBlu Filter** — **A+** Turned Gila sludge into clear water. Better flow and easier flushing than Sawyer.

**Apps: FarOut, Gaia+, Garmin Explore/Messenger** — FarOut is still the gold standard for navigation and water notes. Gaia solid for GPS tracking, though its mileage calc remains quirky.

1osxsrc,https://i.redd.it/w5tr189gcb0g1.png,I'm Planning an Ace Attorney Fan novelisation based on the first game!,"Hello everyone! so i was thinking about Ace Attorney (as usual) and i think i want to make an Fan Novelisation of the first game, now i know Ace Attorney is a visual novel and that would be taking the visual out of it, but i think it would be an intresting writing task personally as to tell the same basic story but in a less visual medium, we know pictures tell a thousand words but what if those designs and enviornments were turned into words

also i wouldn't just copy 1/1 the text of the original as that would be boring and basically impossible, but taking them and using my own words, minus important and iconic quotes would be word for word

though not everything would stay the same, i might try to condense some more drawn out stuff, to make room for a few new things. obviously Shu Takumi didn't have the hindsight of JFA and T&T when writing this game but i do so i'd add some elements from those to tie more of the trilogy together if i ever intend to make a JFA novelisation, of course such thing would be: Morgan being complicit in Redd White's murder of Mia, i know that it's not in the original text but it's my novelisation! but it makes sense she would know about him with the misty situation and also Morgan already frames her for murder in JFA so she might as well kill two birds with one stone or in this case Sisters

multiple perspectives would be in the story, mostly Phoenix but also maya would have a good few, with a multitude of perspectives it would allow things not originally fully shown to be done so, such as maya finding Mia's body in the office, also Pearl would make a cameo as the perspective of the scene with Morgan on the phone with Redd White and perhaps Edgeworth with one of the trial segment with Oldbag and also the flashback of DL-6 in more detail

and other changes would be here, but i won't spoil them all, i do love writing and i do love Ace Attorney so i guess this would be a fun exercise, though one thing i'm contemplating is if i should include RFTA as it's very long but i guess it could form as an extended epilogue but what do you all think of that

how about you have a look at the prolouge and a bit of chapter 1 i wrote: Prolouge: The Theft of Life

“The Worst of times are when Lawyers have to force their biggest smiles” that’s what my Mentor: Mia Fey always Told me, and i would be: Phoenix Wright, and i’m… quite an Ace Attorney, well at least i hope i become one… my first case, one i’ve been dreading for a while, the start of ones career can be a defining moment on how they’ll be even through Trials and tribulations… though my first trial… is for my best friend: Larry Butz, we met in grade school, once when i was at my lowest moment but i was saved by another who… i haven’t seen in a long time, he is the reason i went to pick up the profession of being a Defense lawyer… i swore from that day forward to protect the ones who were beaten into a corner by the world, by our legal system… but unfortunately, Larry was that poor chap today… framed for the murder of his girlfriend: Cindy Stone… though i should probably look over the case file Mia gave to me yesterday…

It was a sunny day on July 31st under the California sunshine, people playing on the beach, Road intersections packed (as Usual) and there was Justice for All, but under that sun stood an apartment building, through the halls of the apartment pranced a squirmy little man in a magenta  suit dashing door to door, he gleefully knocked on one of the many doors, and when it opened, he exclaimed “well Howdy! My name is Frank Sahwit! And you sahwit right here! Professional newspaper salesman at your service!” but as the person on the other side started closing the door, he grinned sweating a bit, putting his foot in the door  “now hold it right there… don’t ya think you should hear me out on my services? Come on, we can have a nice cup of coffee in your apartment while we discuss the details…” but then the owner slammed the door and he screamed “YOUCH!!!” but the pain from the door was interrupted for him holding onto his hair for dear life, he threw down his papers to the ground, the headline reading: Robbery spree strikes newspaper subscriptors, he grumbled under his breath as he clenched his brown hair “goshdarnit! How am i supposed to rob people when people hate solictors… i need a new cover, ugh… but how am i gonna pay my bills this week…” but before he could stomp on his newspapers, he noticed a man bursting out of the apartment a few doors down, he had an orange coat and black trousers with spiky brown hair, this would be my best friend and the defendant of this case: Larry Butz, he loudly exclaimed “Ugh… she’s not there, \*sigh\* Cindy’s not been returning any of my calls since she went to Paris… i’d think she’d at least appreciate these… why must this be my love life be like this, maybe i could go talk to Nick, he had an Ex right… what was her  name… Dolly right? maybe he could give some good advice…  because whe she told me i could visit after she came back all i find is an completely empty apartment except for all her valuable furniture!” he put his hands in his pockets dropping the bouquet of flowers reading: For: my one and only love: Cindy Stone’

Frank smiled to himself “empty apartment except for all her valuables..  Hmmm, suddenly i think my bills are gonna be just fine… just perfect… ohoho… delightfully devilish Sahwit!” he dug into his pockets pulling out a valuable looking golden antique watch reading: 4:30pm as he was about to pick the lock, he looked around with a big smile on his face, but noticed a key still in the door “hmm… what’s this?” he held the key in his hand and it’s tag read ‘Property of Larry Butz’ “hehe… the gullible fool must’ve left his key in the door on his way out…  maybe i should go give him a visit next…” he opened the door into Cindy’s apartment with its beige walls and hastily opened cabinets she must’ve been rushing to pack to her trip to Paris, he put away his newspaper bag taking out his sack, his eyes gleaming as he adjusted his hair licking his lips “JACKPOT! And no witness’ in sight” he took out a few valuable golden necklaces as he danced all through the apartment, he slapped an urn into his sack along with an empty vase along with all her shiny brand new cutlery, if it wasn’t bolted down to the floor he snatched it! Unfortunatly the most valuable things like the fridge and oven were in fact bolted to the floor… as he was looking at all his loot he smirked to himself “wow… this should cover my bills for a decade there’s so much here…”  but suddenly her heard the door open and he dropped all his valuables, and dove into the cupboard as a hiding place… from outside he heard someone come in, “hello apartment! Cindy’s home!” Cindy stone came in with her suitcase filled with souvenirs from paris, she opened it taking out a strange yet interesting statue of ‘the thinker’ and placed it on the table, but she suddenly turned around to see all her valuables strewn across the floor “Huh!? How did these get on the floor? \*sigh\* must’ve been Larry, \*bites lip\* Typical Butz… how did he remove my microwave?” as she went to go to put back her microwave, Frank jumped out of the cupboard, but his kleptomania got the best of him as he picked up the statue “hmm… this is an… interesting statue…” but as he was examining the thinker lookin for the logo of a large name jewlary brand, Cindy came back through the kitchen door shouting her bag still in her hand, the light from the kitchen window illuminating the dark room “HEY! What the hell do you think you’re doing in MY apartment!?” Frank fell back dropping the statue on the table “Oh! Cindy, i presume… please, i apoligse for my intrusion but i have newspapers to sell if you’re interested…” his grin fell as she took her smartphone out of her bag “Hello, I’m Cindy Stone, i’d like to report a breaking and enterin–” in a split second filled with rage, he grabbed the head of the thinker and swung it! “You SHUT UP!” she fell back screaming as he bashed it’s blunt edge straight onto her head!

As she fell hard to the wooden floor with her eyes closing slowly, the thinker called out \[I think it’s…. 1pm…\] Frank was breathing heavily “Alright… time to get out of here…” but before he could snatch up the valuables on the floor he dropped,  he noticed blood pouring profusley out of her head, Frank’s heart skipped a beat as he looked down on where she layed on the floor “oh god! I killed her… dammit… why must this always happen to me, i cannot get caught not now… that would make the police investigate the spree of robberies and i’d be in big trouble… what to do what to do…” he paced around the apartment slicking his hair back then putting it back in place, but then he saw a photo on her bedside table with Cindy sitting next to Larry smiling holding two of the thinker statues “Wait… he was here earlier and he left his keys in the door… i’ll make it look like he did it!” he tip-toed over Cindy’s body grabbing Larry’s key from the door placing it next to her, he wiped his fingerprints off of the thinker placing it net to her as well, he grabbed for the phone and started breathing heavily dialing 911 “Hello… Police? This is Frank Sahwit!  And i just witnessed a man named: Larry Butz murder his girlfriend: Cindy Stone in cold blood in her apartment! Hello? Uh… these dang things never work when you need em” but then he noticed an envelope, he opened it and it read

‘Dear, Ms. Cindy Stone, we apoligse for the inconvenience but due to factors outside our control, there has been an electricity blackout to your apartment since 12pm today, we intend to have it fixed at 6pm as soon as we can, but please stay safe in that time and have a good day!”’

He shook his head “godammit… typical, oh well… i gotta get out of here sometime” he looked down to the park below seeing a payphone “Oh thank the lord… forget the loot i’m getting out of here!” he ran out of the appointment leaving Cindy in the dust along with the blood covered thinker statue with the door wide open… 

A month later… i rode up to the courthouse on my bicycle parking to read the last statement “and then Frank Sahwit, the witness called the police from a payphone reporting that Larry Butz was the one who commited the crime and was promptly taken into custody…’  i know that’s not true… Larry would never steal something so important from someone he loves… i know the public or the prosecution don’t believe me that he’s innocent… but i must prove him not guilty, i owe it to him after all… and if i can’t, i won’t ever be able to forgive myself or ever call myself: Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney

# Chapter 1: The First Case: My First Turnabout

As i stepped off my bicycle looking up at the intimidating courthouse surrounded by crowds of people and the press snapping photos while policemen stood at the door, i said to myself as the wind blew my spiky hair “i can only imagine how stressed Larry is right now…” but then i heard a familiar voice behind me “But not as stressed you are about your first trial, huh phoenix?” i turned around and as expected was my mentor: Mia Fey, her long brown hair with her professional looking black blazer and short black skirt, (not really sure how she’s allowed wear that in court but whatever can’t really judge if she’s happy and comfortable in it, it’s 2016 now, so it shouldn’t really matter to me) and around her neck was her yellow muffler scarf and also… some purple… thing, she’s never told me what it really is, the best answer i’ve got is that its culturally important to the village where she’s from, but she said she doesn’t like talking about her time there much so who am i to pry…

I stammered “C-chief… i’m glad you’re here…” Mia smirked at me, as usual in her professional voice “well, i’m glad you are here, with you not being here yet i thought i would have to take over as your client’s defense attorney…” i put my hand on my head smiling innocently as i locked my bike so no bike robbers steal it  “oh… sorry about that Chief… it’s just i wanted to look over the case file you sent me last night and some of the evidence and i did’t get much sleep with this being my first case and you know our client is my best friend and–” Mia put her hand on my shoulder “hehe… Wright, it’s fine, i was just joking with yo, you’re good… so, first case huh? How are you feeling about it… i gotta say i’m impressed you chose a murder case as your first one, those are pretty hard ones, at least we just have three days due to the initial trial system, so it won’t take long” i looked to the ground “chief… i’m going to be honest, i’ve been dreading this for a month, because if a mess up… then i’ll lose Larry forever…” she took a deep breath “Wright, don’t worry about it… you’ll do fine, besides… hehe, your first case will never be as bad as… my first case was if that makes you feel any better, if you need any assistance, i’ll always by your side on the defense bench if you need it, but you’re a smart guy Wright… i trust you…” i almost teared up “thanks chief… i’ll be sure to make you proud and do my best!” Mia cheekingly looked at me “well then… why don’t you go and look your best… you’re supposed to look presentable and professional  in court and you \*snicker\* don’t” i looked up to my suit and nestled next to my shiny brand new Attorney’s badge was an entire tree branch “oh yeah… uhm, you see, while i was peddling my bike, i saw a nice looking red car pass by and i thought i recognised the driver but then i rolled down a hill so… yeah…” she removed the branch from my suit “oh Wright… you’ve always been a bit clumsy, even when i first met you with Grossberg… i guess changing the Bar exam doesnt change that, how about you freshen up now to lot presentable to the judge… that’ll at least give you some points and besides, i heard the prosecutor is: Winston Payne and I've faced him and won and he does have a certain… reputation so you’ll be fine, at least Larry will have a good defense attorney like you and a bad prosecutor against him… much better than that, “undefeated Demon prosecutor” everybody’s in the legal profession has been talking about…” i took a deep gulp knowing who that was… but i took Mia’s suggestion, adjusting my spiky black hair and dark blue suit and pants, finally adjusting my magenta tie as we stood in front of the court doors

As i waited, the paparatzi were taking pictures of the courthouse, Mia turned to me whispering “ignore them… newspaper people cannot be trusted…” but suddenly she had a microphone thrust in her face by a young reporter with a toothbrush like brown hair and glasses… his smile with his creepy pink gums freaking me out along with the nauseating mint smell “Hello Ms. Fey, the name’s Brushel, Spark Brushel! How does it feel like playing second fiddle this time, mind an interview? I can already imagine the headline– professional veteran Defense Attorney playing second fiddle for a rookie” end quote… what’cha think?” i had to hold back Mia from using her legs in a way other than walking as that would be something known as: Illegal and i didn’t need to pass the bar exam for that, i looked at him “i apoligsie for this Mr. Brushel but she’s my mentor and is helping me she’s quite capable but she’s not interested in an interview at the moment” Spark smiled “oh i know that! I think this is a good interesting scoop! But if you ever want an interview or need me anytime in the future! Just give me a call!” but as he was about the hand to it me, Mia brung me inside from the paparazzi, but i could see a girl in a green jacket with red hair push past him snapping a few pictures of us “outta my way Brushel! ‘Cause I’m gettin’ that scoop!” but as the court doors closed, i saw a tall large man in a large dark green coat say “Alright pals, i want you to step back as we’re about to bring in the suspect” 

I took a deep breath and looked to Mia “hey… chief, are you alright?” Mia shrugged looking around “oh don’t worry about me… i’m fine, nothing i’m not used to, ever since my first case… we should probably get ready for the trial…” I looked around the lobby seeing it’s brown desk in the middle surrounded by records and bookshelves adorned with law books, with giant statues of Lady Justice reading: ‘lovingly provided and sculpted by Themis Law Academy Professor: Constance Courte’  the court baliff came up to the both of us “Ms. Fey… were happy to have you back for another trial with your asistant” before mia could say anything i spoke up “HOLD IT! I’m actually the defense attorney for the trial: Phoenix Wright, see…. Uhm, look at my badge!!!” I presented my golden badge to him, “oh, what are you… some kind of Ace Attorney?”  I snicked “uhm.. Well you can say that again… though it’s only my first trial so far so can’t say that quite yet, though this trial is for my best friend so i kinda have to do my best” he raised an eyebrow “uhm… ms. fey, does he know that having a relationship with the defendant can lead to bias? There better be no forged evidence in there!” i was taken aback “Oh no, no! I will try to remain as impartial as i can! Besides i’d never get caught presenting False Evidence, never in a million years!” the baliff sighed “alright, Mr. Wright… well, Ms. Fey would you like me to escort you two to the defendants lobby?” Mia nodded “of course Baliff… tell the judge about our arrival and we’ll be waiting”

As we walked down the hallway, sitting in the Defendant’s lobby on it’s orange couch under a painting of some stairs by a lake and trees, i laid on the couch on my phone breathing heavily, mia laid down on the rest laying her head on my shoulder “you worried looking at the case files…” i stammered sweating “uhm… no, i’m playing mobile games…” Mia shouted in my ear “WRIGHT! Focus! You’re about to go into your first trial to aquit your best friend and you’re playing video games?!” i sweated “I know, I know! It’s just this is a puzzle and i needed to get my critical thinking skills sharp!” her scowl turned to excitement when she leaned over looking at my screen “Holy shit! Is that Professor Layton and the curious village originally released on the Nintendo DS in 2008!?” I leaned back on the couch “you know Professor Layton?” she clapped her hands “of course! I have a copy on the DS back at the office, I have all the games to be honest that i’ve played with my sister… don’t tell anyone though Wright… oh, classic layton and luke… are those your favourite’s too?” i smirked “in fact, no, my favourite game is actually: GHOST TRICK: PHANTOM DETECTIVE! It’s about this–” Mia smiled patting me on the head “i know what it’s about, ive heard of it, pretty sure Capcom published it” i smiled “yeah… i’ve played through it too many times, Shu Takumi is really a genius with writing isn’t he? I really hope i can continue playing the game if it ever comes to Nintendo’s next rumoured system, i think it’s called: The NX… i think but you know due to it’s underratedness it probably will never get a remaster…”

Mia sighed, turning off my phone, putting it on silent “hehe… well i guess that made you feel better, but maybe we can talk more about it after the trial huh…” I nodded , adjusting my position on the couch. “yeah… I guess, you know you’re a good mentor but… i think you’re an even better friend. I haven't had this connection to someone since… well an old friend of mine who moved away…” Mia turned to me smiling warmingly blushing “Aw… i’m flattered, is that friend Larry?” i shook my head “oh, uhm… no… I met him in grade school. Me, Larry and him were best friends until he moved away to Germany about 14 years ago in December of 2001… and anyways, shouldn't Larry be here?” Mia looked around “oh… uhm, 14 years ago… your friend wouldn’t be Prosecutor Edg-–… actually it’s fine… and yeah… shouldn't the police bring him in to talk with us…” i put my arm on the arm rest “yeah… he should be here by no–”

But before i could finish i heard screaming “IT’S OVER IT’S ALL OVER! I’M GOING TO THE SLAMMER! THE BIG HOUSE! THE OL’ HOOBA DOOBA!”  i  faceplamed with mia “yep… that’s Larry Butz alright…” Larry was being dragged in by a horde of police officers as he was kicking and screaming of ‘how guilty he was’ which wasn’t good for our case, (thanks for that Larry…) they placed him on the ground as he kept screaming, i walked over to him “oh Larry! I’m so glad i’m seeing you again! Don’t worry i’m going to get you through this–” he grabbed me by the collar “Nick, Nick! It’s hopeless, they’ve got all that evidence that i did it to my Cindy… I almost believe that I did it… if only Miles or his father were here… they’d be able to save me from my fate… i might as well plan what prison tats i want and where…” he was on the ground dramatically reaching up… Mia looked to the ground, then turned to me “well… i can see why you two are friends… he reminds me a lot like you when I first defended you when we first met…” i stood up winking “yeah… well i’ve come a long way since then…”  Mia chuckled “yeah… the only thing that’s change is that you have passed the bar exam and have a shiny badge… and i guess you’re not wearing that ugly pink sweater that witch of a girlfriend made you…” i adjusted my tie blushing “yeah… i wonder how dollie’s doing in prison…” Mia rolled her eyes putting her hand on my shoulder “i wouldn’t worry about her… she’s just a Hawthorne in the side… anyways, is this… typical Larry behaviour…” 

I looked at larry, then back at her “pretty much… our school had a motto, ‘if something smells, its usually the Butz…” Mia’s eyes bulged out “what?  Oh dear, i feel bad for that poor child with that last name must’ve been quite bullied…” i smirked putting my arm around her “i guess his last name… Stinks!” Mia put my arm down “Phoenix Wright… i never want you to make another pun on his name, that’s rude, and pun names are the lowest form of comedy…” “i thought it was pretty funny….” as she turned around she shouted seeing Larry roll on the floor “WRIGHT CAN YOU TELL YOUR CLIENT TO STOP BREAKDANCING!!!” Larry cried “i’m not \*sob\* breakdancing, i’m having a breakdown!” Mia scowled “same difference…” i ran over to Larry holding his hands “Larry… please, i don’t want you worrying, i promise i will aquit you, see this badge… it means i can help you” i presented my badge to him but his eyes became waterfalls “but… nick, they all think i did it, and i was there at the day of the murder so i must’ve been the one who did it… besides the entire public is telling me i did it… you’re the only lawyer who took my case, what if you’re doing it because you have to… what if i lost the real nick…” my eyes opened, and i dug through my bag taking out a blue signal samurai keychain “hey larry… Remember this?” his eyes also lit up as he took a yellow one out of his orange coat “Yeah… me, you and miles got one and promised we’d be friends forever” i nodded “that’s right… and i’m not breaking that promise, we’re friends forever and i promise to get you proven innocent, i promise… just work with me here…” mia pulled out a tissue and gave it to Larry, as he wiped it out my tears giving me a big thumbs up “Alright… thanks Nick… thanks what was your name?” 

But then he looked at Mia and his eyes turned to hearts “HOCHI MAMA! Hey is your name Eve because i wanna be your Adam…” Mia put her hand to her chest “Excuse me Mr. Butz! But i am quite not interested in a relationship at the moment, you know my last boyfriend well…don’t really want to talk about him… anyways isn’t this case about your well… now ex-girlfriend: Cindy Stone” Larry gave her another thumbs up “Sure thing dude! i would only date anyone if they were comfortable with me! I just think you’re really pretty dude…” mia’s face became even angrier, i put his hand on his shoulder “Larry… please stop flirting with my boss, i’m sure she appreciates the compliment, but please… take this trial seriously…” he smiled waving his sleeve at me“Sure thing nick!” the baliff came into the room “Mr. Wright, the Judge has just informed me that the trial is about the begin, would you and ms. fey and Mr. Butz come into the courtroom…” Mia nodded “yes sir… come on…” Larry went forward “don’t worry guys! I’ll work with you to prove my innocence!” Mia looked at him “i hope so… well Wright… are you ready for your first trial?” i stood there in silence looking as the doors opened with the large courtroom and the gallery was packed… no turning back now… i must defend Larry and prove him innocent… “i was born ready… lets go… i’ve known larry for 23 years all my life… i’m not losing him again”

The three of us walked through the door, Mia by my right side and Larry… only my left walking with swagger like someone in a movie, “can you tell your client to stop walking like he’s Will Powers or Matt Engarde…” Larry blushed “sorry… it’s just my first time in court…”

and i hope you enjoyed my exerpt of it, if you have any feedback i'd love to hear it, i think i gave a pretty good idea what i want to do with it, but i hope you have a lovely day also the title of the novelisation would be: Turnabout Fan Novelisation

1osxpiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1osxpiy/dating_apps_or_in_person_venues_to_find_a_partner/,Dating apps or in person venues to find a partner,"
Hey,

I am a 26-year-old, fit & active guy based in MTL. I’ve recently been through a breakup and took some time off from dating to sort myself out. It’s been over a month now and I feel ready to get back out there.

I have tried dating apps, but it's very Yes and No thing, and right now I am looking for stability.

A little about me: I love being active (gym, outdoors, whatever keeps me moving), I have pets (so I’m an animal person for sure), and I’m pretty laid-back. What I’m looking for is someone who can actually communicate, someone who isn’t afraid to speak their mind, share highs and lows, and be real. I believe relationships work best when you can talk openly, not just when everything’s easy.

Also: I’m not looking for someone who’ll judge me (or me judge them) based on random preferences like “you like coffee?” or “you have a dog?” and if the answer is no then sorry you’re out. For me it’s about personality, connection, how you handle yourself when things are good *and* when they’re not.

If you’re local (or open to meeting in person-ish in MTL), enjoy good conversation, don’t mind pets, and value authenticity more than perfection — I’d love to hear from you. If you want, tell me a bit about yourself and something you’re passionate about.

Note: My intention is  to find out where can I go to meet new people.
Thanks for reading.

I didn’t feel too bad after the fall. I decided to go to l&d out of precaution to make sure baby was ok. Thank god baby looks amazing, but they informed me I was having contractions?! I couldn’t believe I was having contractions because I couldn’t feel them at all. Apparently I was having them as close as 3-5 minutes apart.  Because of this, I was admitted for 24 hour observation. During this time I was given 3/4 IV bags (I was also extremely dehydrated, I had really only had coffee before the incident.). Overnight, a nurse let me know my contractions were looking much better. By the time I was released, I had 2 cervical checks and I was not dilated at all and was considered long/closed/high.  My contractions “resolved” and they my release notes say 0-1/10 minutes. I also had labs done for placental abruption and all my labs came back normal as well as my ultrasound.  

The doctor told me this experience doesn’t even make me any more at risk for preterm labor than any other pregnancy and everything looks great. Baby is doing amazing. 

I am still just so worried that something could go wrong. What if I’m dilating or contracting and don’t realize? I’m trying so hard to stay calm but I’m just so worried.

If you have had a similar experience I would love to hear. Thank you!",1,1762729423.0,pregnant,7,1.0,False

With all due respect, I don't seem to align with the mindset or attributes of the people here, so I've not been able to make many friends here.(They are nice, no offense, but a bit old school and judgemental)

I've tried dating apps to find friends, but the women I've matched were a bit boring, so I've taken out that option. I've WFH, so turning colleagues into friends is also not an option for me.

Also, not much to do here. The only thing I've been able to do is sit at different coffee shops read my book or write shayaris. Usmein bhi, every time - I find women and even some men gazing towards me. Some seem like they're checking me out while some look at me jese mein bc koi mor hu 🦚. Once a girl even recorded me without my knowledge and then sent me that video on Instagram, creep pro max.

So yh, here's me, on this sub, putting some faith to utter this out -  if there's someone (M or F) who has moved to Vapi from another city and is into, books, football/basketball, poetry, street food, music (i play guitar, piano etc), cooking, coffee or even into having good conversations.

I somewhat understand the US stand of banning H1B's because they want to keep the high paying jobs for themselves. 

But in Canada the whole discourse is mainly around low paying jobs. Foreigners are coming in and working at Tim Hortons. If you ask them why that's a problem, because the average Canadian should not be working at a tim Hortons in the first place, you have cheap education,  access to technology, good infrastructure, go get the high paying jobs. Thats what they should be demanding. The conversation then switches to :

1. Old people need those jobs. They 100% dont need those jobs, the government should take care of them from taxes and give them decent living, not slaving away in timmies making coffee at 70.

2. Young kids need part time jobs. No they dont, they need to be studying and enjoying their childhood. You won't find it anywhere except the west that kids are working. They dont need the extra money,  the parents should be paying for everything.  They should be busy learning, whether its hobbies, skills or just education.  Giving them part time is getting rid of them for 5 hours a day during vacation.

3. Disabled people should be doing these jobs. No they absolutely should not be,  theres plenty of high paying jobs and big companies hiring for jobs that are disabled friendly. They deserve to have the same pay check as everyone else and enjoy the luxuries of life. 

Instead of asking their government to create education programs, reskilling opportunities and more high paying jobs, the discourse is about who gets to serve coffee and clean the tables.

1osxo4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osxo4n,Unbreakable - GDR Mixer RG28,"On a train ride last week I did what I haven't done in a while: Read a newspaper. And, what do you know, a long article that I think you guys and gals here will appreciate. It immediately jumped out at me because, wait a minute, I have that thing in my kitchen!



The article is in German and describes a mixer manufactured in the ""DDR"" or GDR in English - former [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany). It was part of the Eastern bloc, a socialist country behind the iron curtain. And, as everyone knows, everything those commies made was crap, right? ... Right?



Well, this mixer has been handed down from my grandma to my mom and now to me. Built in Oct 1984, it's 41 years old and has been used with a few brief breaks almost daily the entire time. Three childhoods of baby mush, countless shakes, smoothies, soups, bread doughs, cake doughs, pancake batter, bowls of whipped cream and, yes - don't tell the folks at r/coffee \- my mom used to grind coffee in that capsule.



Small cracks in the housing started appearing a few years ago, but don't impact its usability. This thing is so sturdy that it's become a sought-after item at second-hand stores and now apparently even has newspaper articles written about it. I'll translate the marked parts:



>""Not only people born at DDR times, but also young people in their early twenties come to Schubert (store owner) from all over Germany and are looking for this kitchen appliance. 'They noticed that many new mixers start smoking after two minutes. With the RG28, they know it will still work the next 40 years.'""



>""According to Godau (design professor), the focus was on producing items with a long life to save resources. That doesn't mean that the DDR produced environmentally friendly. Production should not depend on the ever-changing fashion of capitalistic trade partners.

>

>The economic aspect was just as important: 'Throughout the entire existence of the DDR, material and production resources were anything but abundant.' Godau sees a growing interest among the younger generation in the country that doesn't exist anymore. The DDR design could be understood as a model against waste, climate catastrophe and an 'ever faster spinning carousel of self-presentation'"".



Unfortunately, I may finally have to look for a replacement. You can see in the last pic, the plastic knob that connects the blender stick to the drive train has somehow fused to the hexagonal drive pin on top of the mixer and detached from the blender stick axle. I can't even get it off with pliers. This just happened a few weeks ago. The whisks and kneading hooks still work, but we used the blender very frequently, so we need a solution. Maybe I can find a spare blender stick on some flea market or online and give it another go with getting that knob off. If anyone has a better idea, let me know!
