1j7pzkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1j7pzkt/possible_correlation_between_long_covidbfs_and/,Possible correlation between long covid/bfs and nitric oxide,"
Hey guys fellow twitcher here, been going for about 4 months now started off bilaterally in my legs after some really bad tightness in my hamstrings, some bad health anxiety, poor lifestyle etc. Ive never been an anxious person prior but I do work a stressful job. A quick background I’m a full time paramedic in one of if not the busiest stations in the state, so id like to think there is some element of chronic stress sprinkled in as well as long covid considering my exposure to it.Anywho, I’ve noticed something quite interesting while scouring the forums and doing my own research about this condition and other neurological conditions ( yes i went down that rabbit hole you know what I’m talking about ).  Ive come to find that low Nitric oxide correlates to the  majority of symptoms that most of us have been facing with some links to long covid as-well. Now I am no doctor or anything and this is just something I noticed that lines up with what most of us are facing, but i would like to get your inputs and thoughts about it as-well.

So to start off there are 3 main types of NO in the body:

1. Neuronal Nitric Oxide (nNOS) – Nervous System & Muscle Function
	
Produced by: Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, NOS1)

Location: Brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscles

Function:
Regulates neurotransmission (nerve signaling)
Supports muscle function and coordination
Helps in learning, memory, and mood regulation
Modulates pain perception

Deficiency Effects:
Muscle weakness, cramps, and fasciculations (BFS-like symptoms)
Cognitive issues (brain fog, memory problems)
Anxiety and depression


2. Endothelial Nitric Oxide (eNOS) – Blood Flow & Heart Health

Produced by: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3)

Location: Blood vessel walls (endothelium), heart

Function:
Vasodilation (relaxes blood vessels, lowers blood pressure)
Improves oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues
Prevents blood clotting and artery damage
Protects the heart and brain from stroke & cardiovascular disease

Deficiency Effects:
Poor circulation (cold hands/feet, muscle pain, exercise intolerance)
High blood pressure, increased risk of stroke & heart disease
Fatigue due to reduced oxygen delivery


3.Inducible Nitric Oxide (iNOS) – Immune Response & Inflammation

Produced by: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2)

Location: White blood cells (macrophages), inflammatory cells

Function:
Fights bacteria, viruses, and pathogens
Promotes inflammation during infections
Helps in wound healing


Excessive iNOS Activation (Toxic Effects):
Creates peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), a harmful oxidant
Leads to neuroinflammation & nerve damage (seen in Long COVID, neurodegenerative diseases)
Worsens chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, and fatigue

Here is some further elaboration in related to conditions;

Low NO (nNOS and eNOS) in BFS:

NO’s Role in Nerve Function: Nitric oxide, especially produced by nNOS (neuronal NOS), plays a crucial role in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. Low NO levels can impair neurotransmission and contribute to muscle weakness, cramping, and poor circulation, all of which are common symptoms in BFS.

Neurological Impact: Low NO can lead to impaired blood flow to the brain and muscles, making it harder for the nervous system to function optimally. This may contribute to muscle spasms, twitching, and fatigue, which are hallmark symptoms of BFS.

Pathology: In BFS, a deficiency in NO production could result in poor neurological function, muscle dysfunction, and potentially neuroinflammation, which exacerbates BFS symptoms.

Low NO  (nNOS and eNOS) in Long COVID:

Endothelial Dysfunction: COVID-19 can impair eNOS (endothelial NOS), leading to reduced NO production in the endothelial cells of blood vessels. This causes poor circulation, fatigue, and muscle weakness—common symptoms of Long COVID.

Vascular Inflammation: Persistent inflammation in Long COVID can reduce NO production and contribute to vascular dysfunction, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to tissues and contributing to symptoms like shortness of breath, brain fog, and exercise intolerance.

Neuroinflammation: In Long COVID, increased inflammation can lead to decreased neuronal NO, worsening cognitive symptoms (like brain fog, concentration difficulties, and memory issues) and contributing to muscle weakness and fatigue.


Pathology of iNOS and Peroxynitrite in BFS and Long covid 


iNOS is an enzyme that produces large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) during inflammation. Unlike endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces beneficial NO for blood flow and relaxation, iNOS is upregulated in response to chronic infection, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

In both Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS) and Long COVID, iNOS overactivation leads to excessive nitric oxide production, which can cause:
Neuroinflammation – Overstimulated immune cells (microglia) release inflammatory cytokines that irritate motor neurons.
Excitotoxicity – Excess NO interacts with glutamate pathways, overstimulating motor neurons and causing twitching.
Mitochondrial Dysfunction – High iNOS activity leads to cellular energy deficits, resulting in fatigue, muscle weakness, and nerve dysfunction.


Other symptoms of Low NO:

Random muscle or joint pain (sharp, aching, or burning)
Stiffness and soreness after activity
Muscle cramps or twitches (BFS-related)
Nerve pain (tingling, burning, or sensitivity)
Headaches or migraines
Air hunger” or breathlessness despite normal oxygen levels
Slow reaction time & brain processing lag
Anxiety that feels physical (tight chest, racing heart)
Sensory processing issues (light, sound, and touch sensitivity)
Difficulty regulating emotions (mood swings, overreacting to stress)
Random nerve “buzzing” or electrical zaps
Ears feeling “full” or mild hearing loss without infection
Unstable blood sugar without diabetes
Morning stiffness & difficulty getting moving
Heavy” legs during exercise
Sudden blood pressure spikes
Feet turning red or blotchy when standing
Pale skin or dark under-eye circles even when well-rested
Numbness or tingling that moves around
Inability to sweat properly (too much or too little sweat)


Symptoms of High iNOS & Peroxynitrite Toxicity

Glutamate overload” symptoms (brain fog, wired but tired, sudden irritability)
Sudden sensitivity to caffeine or stimulants
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) that worsens at night
Episodes of “surging energy” followed by extreme fatigue
Random muscle “burning” sensations without exercise
Odd internal vibrations or shaky feeling (but no visible tremor)
Worsening of neurological symptoms after a high-nitrate meal or exercise
Sudden increase in food sensitivities & histamine intolerance
Sharp, migratory joint pain (moves around randomly)
New onset of autoimmune symptoms without a diagnosis
Teeth sensitivity & gum inflammation without cavities
Worsening of symptoms in bright light or fluorescent lighting
Sudden worsening of symptoms with antioxidant deficiency (low vitamin C, glutathione, or NAC)
Waking up at 2–4 AM with a racing heart

All these symptoms to my knowledge have been mentioned in these forums and i found it so interesting how it almost explains everything. Ive found by addressing and supplementing to support nNOS and eNOS production has dramatically reduced my symptoms which initially where;

Severe anxiety (now corrected)
Frequent migraines (havent had one in four months which is amazing considering my migraines where so frequent and last me a week at times)
Light sensitivity (corrected)
Blood pressure spikes (corrected)
High blood pressure (corrected although i was working on this prior to my symptoms 4 months ago)
Nerve buzzing( dramatically reduced was all over my body now occasionally under my feet)
Excessive sweating (corrected)
POTS (corrected)
EXTREME CAFFEINE SENSITIVITY there were times where a coffee would put me into SVT ( i just cut out coffee :((((( )
Gum inflammation (corrected)
Internal vibrations (corrected)
Random joint pain ( still have in my left hand particularly with some numbness severity differs day to day possible cubital tunnel involvement)
Fasiculations ( still present but not as violent or as frequent) 
Fatigue (finally wake up refreshed)
Brain fog(i have occasional dumb moments but not as severe)


Heres the list of what I took if you want doses and timing just shoot me a message;

Mag glycinate
Creatine
Amino acids
Zinc + copper
Ubiquinol (best for brain fog and fatigue IMO)
Vit d3 and k2
L theanine
B12 activated form i.e methyl
Benfotamine
Creatine (most researched supp in the world for a reason)
Beetroot extract
Taurine
Omega 3

Stuff im going to add;

NAC
ALA
VITAMIN C AND E
QUERCETIN
L citrulline

Also a hot tip I made major lifestyle changes not just supplementation; for my first month I was pretty much bed bound, my missus forced me up to do some light exercise and get up off my ass no matter how bad i felt. I would walk as soon as i woke up for about 30 mins get some sunlight in, walk barefoot on grass and did some grounding(not sure if this worked or placebo to be honest but give it a go nothing to lose), cold showers, intermittent fasting, cutting out bad foods, sugars you know the stuff we always see on the forums. Theres plenty more and im happy to help you guys privately. 

Anywho thats enough from me let me know what you guys think your input would be greatly appreciated 😇😇

1j7px14,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1j7px14/boost_your_brain_power_the_surprising_benefits_of/,Boost Your Brain Power: The Surprising Benefits of Coffee!,"Coffee is more than just a morning ritual—it’s a powerful brain booster that can enhance focus, memory, and overall cognitive function. But how does coffee actually work to improve brainpower? Is it just the caffeine, or is there more to this popular beverage? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the **scientific benefits of coffee for the brain**, hear from coffee experts, and explore real-life experiences of coffee lovers.

# How Coffee Boosts Brain Power: The Science Behind It

# 1. Caffeine Enhances Focus and Alertness

One of the primary reasons people drink coffee is to feel more awake. Caffeine blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired, leading to **increased alertness and focus**. This is why coffee is often recommended before important meetings, study sessions, or tasks that require deep concentration.

# 2. Improves Memory and Learning Ability

According to a study published in *Nature Neuroscience*, caffeine can enhance memory retention for up to 24 hours after consumption. Researchers found that people who consumed coffee **performed better in memory tests** than those who didn’t.

# 3. Boosts Mental Energy and Reduces Brain Fog

Coffee contains powerful antioxidants, including **chlorogenic acid**, which helps protect brain cells from damage. This means regular coffee consumption can **reduce brain fog and mental fatigue**, keeping your mind sharp throughout the day.

# 4. Reduces the Risk of Neurodegenerative Diseases

Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have a **lower risk of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease**. Research from the *Journal of Alzheimer's Disease* found that people who drank coffee regularly had up to a **65% lower chance of developing Alzheimer’s** later in life.

# 5. Elevates Mood and Fights Depression

Coffee doesn’t just keep you awake—it also makes you happier. Caffeine stimulates the release of **dopamine and serotonin**, the brain’s “feel-good” chemicals. A Harvard study found that women who drank **four cups of coffee per day had a 20% lower risk of depression**.

# Real-Life Experiences: How Coffee Helps People Stay Productive

To understand how coffee improves brain function in everyday life, we spoke with several coffee lovers and professionals.

# Interview with Dr. Michael Lawson – Neuroscientist and Coffee Enthusiast

*""As a neuroscientist, I’ve studied how caffeine affects the brain, and I can say that moderate coffee consumption can significantly enhance cognitive function. I personally drink a cup of black coffee before deep research work, and it helps me stay focused for hours without distraction.""*

# John's Story – How Coffee Helped Him Ace His Exams

John, a college student, shared his experience:  
*""During my final exams, I started drinking coffee in the morning and found that my focus improved dramatically. I was able to retain more information and recall it faster during tests. Coffee became my secret weapon for academic success.""*

# Emma’s Productivity Hack – Coffee and Deep Work

Emma, a freelance writer, shared how coffee helps her stay productive:  
*""I used to struggle with writer’s block, but ever since I started drinking coffee before writing, I’ve noticed that ideas flow more naturally. My productivity has skyrocketed!""*

 

# Expert Tips: How to Maximize Coffee’s Brain-Boosting Benefits

1. **Drink Coffee in Moderation** – Too much caffeine can cause jitters and anxiety. Experts recommend **1-3 cups per day** for optimal benefits.
2. **Choose High-Quality Coffee** – Organic, single-origin coffee has more antioxidants and fewer toxins.
3. **Avoid Sugar and Artificial Creamers** – These can cause energy crashes. Opt for **black coffee or add a splash of almond milk**.
4. **Pair Coffee with Healthy Fats** – Adding **MCT oil or grass-fed butter** can provide longer-lasting mental energy.
5. **Time Your Coffee Intake** – Drinking coffee **mid-morning** (between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM) helps avoid energy crashes.

 

# Final Thoughts: Is Coffee the Ultimate Brain Booster?

The answer is **yes—when consumed responsibly!** Coffee isn’t just about waking up in the morning; it’s a natural, science-backed way to improve **focus, memory, mood, and overall brain health**. With decades of research supporting its benefits and countless real-life success stories, coffee remains one of the most effective and accessible cognitive enhancers.

1j7pwug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1j7pwug/i_have_a_straightforward_ltrmarriage_profile_why/,I have a straightforward LTR/marriage profile. Why do men still try for a hookup and waste my time?,"I’m dating for marriage, in my mid 30s living in a big city. I’ve been actively intentionally dating for a few months now. I would say I’m conventionally attractive as I get many matches and frequent dates. I chip slowly through matches and am trying to keep an open mind of who I date. I swipe on complete profiles, ignore the super hot ones, go for the mid guys, have LTR in their profile, height/ethnicity don’t matter to me. Dating anywhere from 28-44, heights mostly 5’6’-6’2 but moreso 5’8-5’9 is the average. I don’t want to sound full of myself but I’ve never been rejected yet and always asked on future dates. 

I have a profile that would scare most men who are not serious as I pick long term partner and marriage in the selected “looking for” category. I also want kids and it’s selected in my profile as well. I talk about this on the first date, though I do not give a specific timeline, I have told them “sooner than later” because frankly at my age, it’s something that needs to be established if it’s a dealbreaker for some. I’ve been told from other redditors to stay away from the exact timeline on the first date but plant seeds about my future life goals/short term goals. I further elaborate on future dates but I have never given a hard timeline to anyone. I also don’t have one in mind to be honest but I know it needs to happen sooner than later because of the reality of female fertility. 

I enjoy my dates, the men are nice, I am treated well, and respected. Sex is a boundary that I communicate which is reserved for serious emotional connections only, when in a relationship. Texts frequencies are matched because I don’t reply straight away and conversations are kept for in person dates, emotionally vulnerable and thought provoking questions and conversations are had through dates, while I learn more about them. I’m a talker and I ask a LOT questions. Dates are not rushed, they’re actually quite long anywhere from 3-6 hours (I know! I’m trying my best to shorten them), and happen with each guy once a week or once every other week. I never bring up the topic of exclusivity and I’m not trying to rush it either but no one seems to make it past the one month mark so it doesn’t matter. 

Anyway, my problem here is that I get up to the third date and it seems the facade that these men cannot keep up with unravel itself by then. Either I learn more about their emotional intelligence, finances, and other factors which prove that they are in fact definitely NOT ready for marriage and kids or they are still struggling to keep me interested by showing off their potential. I’m not dating for potential anymore so I cut them off. In and around this point or before though, they almost always suggest some sort of date like coming over and cooking dinner, a lower effort date like coffee (which I don’t mind) but then talk about sex, or just straight up sex offers. Why are they going from 0 to 100 when I have expressed the boundary of sex from the beginning? I’ve never kissed any of these men except one. 

Sometimes they do this before the third date and they’re easier to cut off, abut why am I the one being made to feel guilty for blatantly *wanting* to be in a relationship, marriage, and have kids?

I would say I have a strong filtering process requiring at least a week’s worth of texts in the app before meeting, I never give out my number until after the first meeting, openly talk about my intentions from the beginning, it’s also shown in my profile (I know people don’t read which is why I repeat my intentions), and I’ve purposely made my profile this rigid so the guys who are looking for hookups will swipe left. The majority of the guys who still try for hookups are eliminated before the first or by the end of the first date; however there are still a select few who make it through. Some matches end because we notice incompatibilities so it’s not all matches that go the hyper sexual route after a bit. I know dating is a process but I’m feeling more and more discouraged as I date. 

What are some of the questions you may ask in the talking stage/dating stage before exclusivity to gauge their true intentions? Or are these men going into it actually thinking they have the same intentions as I do, realize that they can’t meet my intentions, can’t change my mind, and then just throw in the towel and see if they can get sex anyway? Or are they deceptive from the beginning? 
What are some less obvious signs a guy is not serious?

Can anyone give me advice on how I can better navigate this? It truly is becoming a numbers game now.

Some jobs are mundane, tedious, meant to pass the time until something better comes along. But others—others exist in the spaces between, where the rules of reality bend and break. This is the story of Solomon Vance and the job he should have never accepted.""

Solomon Vance had nothing left.

His savings were gone, his eviction notice was taped to the door, and the job market had chewed him up and spat him out. He had sent out dozens of applications, walked into businesses with a forced smile, and shook hands with managers who never called back.

That night, as he sat outside a 24-hour diner nursing a cup of coffee he could barely afford, he felt the weight of his own failure pressing down on him.

And then he saw him.

A man standing beneath the buzzing streetlight. Tall. Dressed in a pristine black suit. A wide-brimmed hat casting his face in shadow. But it wasn’t his attire that unsettled Solomon. It was the way the man's hands were positioned—backwards, twisted at the wrists as if reality had made a mistake in shaping him.

Solomon blinked. The man was closer now.

No footsteps. No sound.

The man extended a black card, its golden lettering catching the dim glow of the streetlight.

Solomon hesitated but took it. The card was cold.

There were only a few words.

""Graveyard Attendant – 146 Blackwood Road.""

No interview. No contact info. Just an address.

When Solomon looked up, the man was gone.

He should have walked away.

He should have torn the card in half.

Instead, he went to 146 Blackwood Road.

The graveyard was too large for the town. It stretched on for what felt like miles, headstones jutting out of the mist like broken teeth. The office was a small shack near the front gate, with a single yellow light glowing dimly in the window.

Inside, a key and a notebook sat on the desk. No one was there to greet him.

The notebook had only three rules:

1. Lock the gate at midnight.

2. Do not answer if someone knocks on the office door.

3. If you see an open grave, do not look inside.

That was it.

Solomon laughed under his breath. “Weird, but whatever.”

The job was simple—walk the grounds, check the perimeter, and stay in the office until sunrise.

For the first hour, nothing happened.

By the second hour, he heard shuffling footsteps beyond the graves.

By the third, something knocked on the office door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Solomon stiffened.

The knock wasn’t urgent. It was slow. Rhythmic. Expectant.

He checked the time. 3:13 AM.

Do not answer if someone knocks on the office door.

His breath caught in his throat.

The knocking continued.

Then, a voice. Too familiar. Too wrong.

""Sol… Let me in, man.""

His stomach twisted.

It was his brother’s voice.

But that was impossible. His brother had died three years ago.

""Come on,"" the voice insisted, still calm, still patient. ""Just open the door.""

Solomon clenched his fists. He didn’t move.

Minutes stretched into eternity.

And then—the knocking stopped.

Soft footsteps shuffled away.

Solomon didn’t sleep.

At dawn, he grabbed the notebook and scribbled four words beneath the rules.

""DO NOT SPEAK TO THEM.""

He left the graveyard, the black card still in his pocket.

And when he got home, he tried to throw it away.

But the next night, when he checked his jacket, the card was still there.

Waiting.

The job wasn’t over.

It would never be over.

""I am The Witness, and I remember Solomon Vance. He was given a job no one else would take. A job that will follow him for the rest of his days. Because some jobs don’t let you quit.

He is like a sunshine in my darkest days, i has some feeling for him, but probably it wasnt love yet. I felt like i kinda met my soulmate. We can talk about everything and its always so comfy and cozy to talk to him.

Its been 2 years since we ended things and stayed as friends. During these 2 years we didnt met  each other. Sometimes he can answer my stories, i will reply and this continued like this 2 years. Btw he has a gf right now for a little more than 1 year from now.

Sometimes when he is testing me, i can feel something really empty inside him. Like he wants to tell me something but didnt dare to tell. Few times during these 2 years he texted me that he kinda miss the time we spent together, i only replies him that it was good but he has a girlfriend right now so its not really the good way to continue things like this.

Also 2 years ago me made a promise to each other - when i turn 25 yo and if we both single by that time we will give each other a second chance.

4 days ago he replied to my storie but jusk me ""how are u doing?"". We talk a bit and i felt like he is not really okey, idk its always like this, its feels like i can fully feel that person from the inside. We started to talk as i asked is he okey, he started to tell me a story about his current gf - she wants him to propose to her but he is not sure that she is the person that he wanna share life together. He told me that he continue to be with her only because of feeling of responsibility.

We decided to meet right after this, he picked me up and we went to grab some coffee (it was him asking me to meet this time)

A bunch of feelings, we just turned back to the first day we meet - coffee shop. the same table, the same order, the same time, the same month of the year. We talked a lot and in the end when he took me home = he asked if he can hug me and idk why i agreed. I know thats shitty to do that thing since he has a gf, but damn it felt so real, so comfy, so protected.

After he turned back home he texted me that he really missed this feeling these 2 years and he wanna retry someting together.

But the main thing is that curretnly he is not thinking about breaking up with his gf cause he dont know how to tell her lol. Excuses

plz help with advice from your pint of view on what should i do. I know thats its not good since he has a gf, also i dont wanna be a home breaker but its so hard to still keep my mind clear in this situation since its feels so unusual and exiting to feels something between us again even after 2 years of not seeing each others.",1,1741577794.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

So my sister got married last August to her boyfriend of 12 years. Up to until that point they've lived separately; her in my mom's house and him in his father's house. Now they've been working on getting their own home for over a year now but it's still not complete. Her husband's father's house is not really suitable for a married couple such as them and they don't want to pay rent while trying to build their home so their only option is...well... my mom's house.

Anyway here's a number of things that annoys me about them:

1. He doesn't chip in to help pay the bills and my sister justifies this by saying he's busy using his money to finish their new home.


2. He doesn't help with cleaning the house even when my sister (who is pregnant btw) begs him too. He might help with the dishes when he feels like it.


3. He likes to put his feet up on my coffee table and kitchen bar. Like dude you're already not doing any chores in this house and even I don't put my feet up on my mother's furniture. Plus my mom is a neat freak and when she sees her furniture looking the tiniest bit of dirty I'm the one who gets yelled and told to clean even if I didn't mess it up.

4. Having sex while everyone's at home: 
Now I'm not a prude and I get it, they're adults and married. I know that they're gonna be having sex but doing it knowing I'm right across the hall from you and while I'm trying to sleep? Can y'all do that shit when you're the only ones at home? That makes me extremely uncomfortable.

5. My sister likes to b*tch and complain about my mom and I being talking too loudly but her and her man literally have arguments in the presence of me that should be held in private.


So yeah I just needed to get this rant out of my system because I have no one I can talk to about this 👍",3,1741577603.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False
1j7pm2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1j7pm2n/how_to_tell_my_mormon_coworker_his_favorite_menu/,How to tell my Mormon coworker his favorite menu item has espresso powder in it?,"For context I am a pastry chef, I grew up Catholic but I am currently agnostic. I grew up with kids of all different religious backgrounds so I know a handful of things from each religion from my friends growing up. One of my best friends from my  highschool days is Mormon and from her I learned that she avoided coffee and teas. During friend gatherings I would make my chocolate cake recipe that has espresso powder in it, as well as a chocolate cake recipe that didn't have the espresso specifically for her. She was always really careful of her food choices so that she could avoid those ingredients and I wanted her to feel respected and not left out during friend events. 

I'm a pastry chef and just found out that one of my coworkers is Mormon. He buys at least one of my brownies every other shift, he's down right obsessed with them. He even buys multiple every now and then and brings it home for his family. The problem is that there is a good amount of espresso powder in that recipe.... 

When we get a new hire at my work I always make sure to ask people if they have any food allergies or restrictions before offering them food, so when he started working with us, I asked him if he had any restrictions and he said ""no"". I use my coworkers to taste test things for me all the time since ironically enough as a pastry chef I hate sweet foods. Through my testing, this coworker really fell in love with my brownie recipe that I launched a couple of months ago.

Now, I understand that if you don't bake for a living, you probably wouldnt assume there is coffee or tea as an ingredient in things, but in my profession we use coffee or even certain teas to elevate/enhance the main flavors. Coffee is widely used to enhance chocolate desserts. I make sure to really emphasize the whole ""allergies OR food restrictions"" with people since sneaky ingredients like gelatin and coffee are used a lot for dessert making, but can be bad for certain religious groups.

I feel extra horrible now knowing his family is Mormon and his father is a bishop and has probably eaten my brownies a good number of times. I've been loosing my mind googling the severity of this situation as recount the time my friend from highschool accidentally ate the wrong cake at my birthday dinner and cried for a good half hour. I'm genuinely mortified knowing I accidentally helped someone break a rule in their religious practice. 

How should I breach this with my coworker? I obviously have to tell him right? My other coworker (B) is Muslim and she told me that if she accidentally ate something that had pork, like a dessert with gelatin, she would rather I not tell her and just stir her towards another ""safe"" option for her to enjoy. She was there when I found out that coworker (A) is Mormon and saw me freak out over how I would tell him. I wouldn't feel right if I didn't tell him now that I know it's something he shouldn't eat. 

I'll offer to make a small batch without Espresso specifically for him and his family if they still crave for the brownies, but I just don't know how to let him know without hurting his feelings or making things weird since professionally it feels inappropriate to bring up religion?

Idk I'm sorry if this is hard to read, I tend to yap and go into tangets when I'm stressed. ",3,1741577507.0,mormon,10,1.0,False

1j7plbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1j7plbg/monster_sonin_law/,Monster Son-in law,"My stepdaughter married in January of 2022. She was 27. She lived at home with her mother and sister until she was 25 and her sister was 26. Their mom divorced when they were 15 and 16 respectively. Since the divorce was finalized they have not seen or had any contact with their birth father except birthday cards (never on time) and Christmas cards (never on time) 
I entered the picture in February of 2019 and married their mother in November of 2019. I had a fantastic relationship with both girls until the youngest (we will call her A) married. Her sister married in 2020 and her mother and I have a fantastic relationship with her and her husband. They live 90 miles away. (A) and her husband live 14 miles away. 
(A) and her husband married at our family church. Her and her mother and sister had been members for 10 years. Her husband for 1 1/2 years. (A) had been a member of the praise band for years. (A) and her husband left the church after their reception and never set foot in it again. Her husband had found them a new church and they changed denomination. Went from Southern Baptist to a different denomination which I will not name.
My wife and I live 7 houses away from her parents. 
Here’s the list. In 3 years…

Nobody has ever been invited to their church. She has been to her sisters 90 miles away multiple times.

Her mother and I have been to their trailer, once. Her sister twice. 

They stopped coming to Sunday lunch at my in-laws which had been a family tradition of theirs since the girls were born. The reason given was because they had a morning and evening service to attend it was too tiring to come to lunch. Their new church is 6 miles from my in-laws.
They said that they would instead come on Fridays each week to see her grandparents. They came once. 

Her mother has had one phone call since the marriage. Before they talked easily 3 times a week. Her mother has tried repeatedly to call, no answer. Her grandparents have tried to call, no answer. 

The couple has been in our house, her childhood home, twice since the marriage. The last time her husband viciously verbally attacked her mother when I was not there.

They had a baby in November of 2023. My wife has seen her grandson once since he left the hospital. I have not seen the baby since he left the hospital. 

We have offered to pay for counseling between her and her mother. She will not meet with her without husband in tow. We offered her and her mother and a counselor. Offer denied. We offered the four of us, so her husband would be there, with a third party counselor. Offer denied. 

She told her mother that she feels everybody hates her husband and therefore she does not want her around the baby because she feels she will be a bad influence and not a good Christian. Absurd. All of this about the counseling and seeing the grandchild was via text. Last contact with her by us. That was last July.

She had coffee with her sister last December 7. First time they had seen one another in over a year. They used to be like Anna and Elsa. They were inseparable. Even after her sister married they talked constantly. Her sister told her that if she did not fix things with mom and grandparents, it would be diffficult to have a relationship with her. She has not heard from her since. 

She has cut off all contact with every friend she had prior to the marriage. A year after the marriage her best friend who had moved to New York invited her and her sister to come visit. She said she could not go. Her reason was quote “I cannot defy the wishes of my husband”. Who the f’ck says that! 

A month before the baby was born she quit her job working for an optometrist to be a stay at home mom. She told her sister at the coffee date, they were having financial issues.

(A) and her husband have not only missed but have not called or texted every Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Birthdays. 

We don’t know what to do. We have thought about a wellness check but we are afraid after they leave he will take it out on her. Honestly we have no way of knowing if she is still breathing. Her last visual contact was December 7. We refuse to go to their home because the husband has a gun safe with an AR-15. 
At what point does my stepdaughter become a missing person? 
One last thing. Her grandfather and myself went to their church one Sunday evening to try and talk to them. They refused to come out and the church officials implied if we didn’t leave they would call the police. We believe the church is basically a cult. We found out from someone who is familiar with this church that it is cult like. 
No idea anymore what to do. Anybody?

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

In a world where financial freedom is just a scan away, Bitcoin BTMs (Bitcoin Teller Machines) are changing how people buy and sell Bitcoin. Gone are the days of complex exchange sign-ups, long verification processes, and frustrating withdrawal delays. With Bitcoin BTMs, you can walk up, insert cash, and get Bitcoin sent directly to your wallet in minutes. But there’s one catch—if you don’t have the right tools, your transactions can be clunky, error-prone, and even risky.

That’s where the magic of [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in. This free Bitcoin QR code dApp makes transactions faster, more secure, and nearly effortless. If you've ever struggled with mistyping a wallet address or worried about sending Bitcoin to the wrong place, this tool is your new best friend. So, let’s dive into the world of Bitcoin BTMs, QR codes, and how they work together to create the ultimate crypto experience.

# What is a Bitcoin BTM, and Why Should You Care?

Imagine an ATM, but instead of dispensing cash, it gives you Bitcoin. That’s a Bitcoin BTM (Bitcoin Teller Machine) in a nutshell. These machines are popping up in malls, gas stations, and convenience stores worldwide, making it easier than ever to buy and sell Bitcoin with physical cash.

# Why People Love Bitcoin BTMs

1. **Instant Bitcoin Purchases** – No waiting for bank transfers or exchange approvals.
2. **No Need for a Bank Account** – Perfect for the unbanked or those who prefer privacy.
3. **Fast and Easy** – Insert cash, scan your wallet QR code, and receive Bitcoin in minutes.
4. **Sell Bitcoin for Cash** – Some BTMs even let you cash out your Bitcoin instantly.

Whether you're a crypto veteran or a newbie, Bitcoin BTMs provide a simple way to access Bitcoin without the headaches of traditional exchanges.

# The Problem: Long Wallet Addresses and Transaction Errors

Bitcoin transactions should be easy, right? Just send Bitcoin from point A to point B. But there’s a catch—wallet addresses are long, complex, and easy to mistype. One wrong character and your Bitcoin could vanish into the blockchain abyss forever.

Most Bitcoin BTM transactions require you to enter your wallet address. You could manually type it in (not recommended), copy and paste it (risky if malware is lurking), or… use a Bitcoin QR code (the smart way).

# The Solution: Bitcoin QR Codes Make Transactions Foolproof

A Bitcoin QR code is a scannable code that instantly fills in your wallet address when buying Bitcoin at a BTM. Instead of fumbling with long addresses, you just hold up your phone, scan the code, and boom—your Bitcoin is on the way.

# Benefits of Using a Bitcoin QR Code

✅ **Eliminates Human Error** – No more mistyped wallet addresses. ✅ **Saves Time** – A quick scan is faster than manual entry. ✅ **Enhances Security** – Reduces the risk of malware replacing copied wallet addresses. ✅ **Perfect for Business Payments** – Accept Bitcoin instantly by displaying a QR code.

# Enter: The Free Bitcoin QR Code Maker dApp

Now that you know why Bitcoin QR codes are essential, let’s talk about the best way to generate them. The [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is a free dApp that lets you instantly create QR codes for your Bitcoin wallet. No app downloads, no sign-ups—just pure functionality.

# How It Works

1. **Visit the Website** – Open [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) on your phone or computer.
2. **Enter Your Wallet Address** – Paste your Bitcoin wallet address.
3. **Set a Payment Amount (Optional)** – If you’re requesting a specific amount, you can include it in the QR code.
4. **Generate the QR Code** – Click the button, and your scannable Bitcoin QR code appears instantly.
5. **Use It Anywhere** – Save it, share it, or print it for Bitcoin transactions.

It’s that simple. Whether you're buying Bitcoin at a BTM, selling goods for BTC, or collecting payments, this dApp makes transactions smooth and error-free.

# Real-World Scenarios: How People Are Using Bitcoin QR Codes and BTMs

# 1. Newbie Crypto Buyers at BTMs

Mike, a first-time Bitcoin buyer, was excited to use a BTM. But when it asked for his wallet address, he panicked. Typing a long Bitcoin address at the machine was intimidating. Then he found Bitcoin QR Code Maker. Within seconds, he generated a QR code, scanned it at the BTM, and received his Bitcoin instantly—no stress, no mistakes.

# 2. Merchants Accepting Bitcoin

Lisa runs a small coffee shop and wanted to accept Bitcoin payments. Instead of asking customers to type her Bitcoin address, she printed a QR code from Bitcoin QR Code Maker and displayed it at the counter. Now, customers just scan and pay—fast, easy, and 100% accurate.

# 3. Tipping with Bitcoin

Alex, a musician, set up a Bitcoin tip jar using a QR code. At the end of a performance, people scanned the code and sent him Bitcoin directly. No credit card fees, no middlemen—just direct support from fans.

# The Future of Bitcoin Transactions: QR Codes and BTMs Together

As Bitcoin adoption grows, BTMs and QR codes will play a massive role in making crypto payments seamless. Here’s what the future looks like:

🔹 **More Bitcoin BTMs Worldwide** – With thousands already in operation, expect even more locations. 🔹 **Lightning-Fast Transactions** – As Lightning Network integration expands, Bitcoin BTMs will become even faster and cheaper. 🔹 **Wider Merchant Adoption** – QR codes will make in-person Bitcoin payments mainstream. 🔹 **Greater Privacy & Security** – QR codes reduce human error and exposure to security risks.

Bitcoin isn’t just an investment—it’s a revolution in financial freedom. And with Bitcoin BTMs and QR codes, using it in everyday life is easier than ever.

He gave my contact info and my roommates contact info to the realtors office and they contact us all of the time - which I will get into the details of shortly. Several weeks ago I finally got fed up and sent them and email telling them to stop contacting me and that any texts, WhatsApp messages, or phone calls would be blocked and ignored but they called me again tonight at 6pm asking to do a showing at 3pm tomorrow. I hung up on them. 

Calling on a Sunday at dinner time? What's wrong with you! Also, it was less than 24 hours notice and now they sent me an email at 6:43pm saying there's a showing at 6:00pm tomorrow. Still less than 24 hours lol and they tagged a bunch of legal documents as if that supported their still not legal notice.

Here is the list of everything they've done and which I'm asking would possibly be grounds for suing:

• Contacting me several times a week through texting, WhatsApp, email, and phone calls, even after being told not to.

• Constantly requesting and being aggressive towards us about leaving the suite during 2 hour showings, including asking us to leave during the January snow storm earlier this year. One realtor asked my roommate if she could ""Go work in a coffee shop"" and then proceeded to be rude and awkward when she didn't.

• My roommate took a shower one time (she was not informed about the showing because they weren't giving us proper notice, just emailing only me) and I got several angry texts and calls while I was at work. She hopped out of the shower to a strange man in the house while in a towel.

•  Landlord and realtors bugging me for weeks over the Christmas season to go get an extra key cut for them. Not my job!

• Realtors asked me if they could do a showing the next day at **NOON**. I said no as it was less than 24 hours notice. They proceeded to show up anyway at **10AM**, bust open my roommates door, proceed to stand in the open doorway while my roommate was fully nude, and tell her she has 5 minutes to leave. So a literal B&E.

We're all moving at the end of this month anyway so this nightmare will be over soon but I just really don't want them to get away constantly harassing us. What do you guys think? If the most I can do is ruin their 5 star Google rating, then so be it lol.",0,1741576781.0,vancouverhousing,9,0.5,False

“We wanted to make fun of the long history and inherent misogyny of gynoids, sex robots, and artificial intelligence. Look no further than the sex robot ‘Sweetheart’ created by Clayton Bailey in 1983 who not only was a sex aid with 36C’s and a voice synthesizer but also a functioning coffee machine.

1j7pd6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j7pd6n/m46_what_to_do_to_help_my_friend_m32_and_his/,"(M/46) What to do to help my friend (M/32) and his women conundrums (various females around his age), and to understand him better myself. But how can I help this person stop pursuing women who are already with other men so he can find a woman who might actually give him what he wants and needs?","I have a friend named B.  I'm asking what I should do about this friend.  Obviously I am there for him, though he moved away.

I met him about 9 years ago.  He was very young and I was also much younger than I am now, but I was 14 years older.  In that time I got married, bought a house, found financial stability.

In those years he graduated with a Masters degree in Music or Arts Management or something, and lost his job with a local classical music organization (non-profit) and threw in the towel and moved to Milwaukee, where I guess his family lives but he's originally from Indiana.  He's holding for for ""loan forgiveness for public service workers"" or something, so he won't get a real job.

B is not an only child.  I'm not sure but I think he is the middle child with 2 sisters and a brother, one sister and one brother younger, B is oldest male.  His younger sister is pretty attractive, smart.  She got the good nose genes, if you know what I mean.  She was recently on television on a TV show but I won't say which one. Nice looking, bubbly, funny, with high standards. (This was kind of out of the blue for me to learn. In fact I think I was the last person to learn it, but that's fine, I don't live near him anymore.)

It must be fun to have a big family (I'm sure only sometimes) but whatever.  His younger brother is also pretty entertaining, but he is a simple guy.  He's going to be an electrician, and that's it.

B is ""personality"" attractive, but he has a lot of acne.  He is also a fairly lazy guy who doesn't really keep up his appearances like a single man should.  He's actually fun to hang out with, and likes film, and games, and music, and he himself is a talent who composes and plays classical. One time we went to Vegas and he puked all over Freemont St from just smelling a cigerettte. He doesn't smoke cigarettes, but he drinks a lot if he wants to.  He smokes pot, too.

And from what I gather, his older sister, whom he now lives in the basement of, got rich somehow.  Like sold a tech company or is a higher-up executive at a big deal firm.  She lives in Milwaukee, so take your guess.  I know about 0 regarding Milwaukee tech.  The only time I've seen the city is in the beginning of Laverne and Shirley.

My friend is half-Asian (I'd say which but it's to keep him anonymous) and half-German.  He gets defensive about the Asian side.  I've only heard him talk about his father, not Asian , who he disagrees with politically (dad=Right, he=Left).  His father is also apparently rather religious, and he is atheist.  He admits he knows very little about Asia. For example, one night we were hanging out and he has no money.  I'm like ""we have X , Y , Z, oh and these dumplings"" and he is like ""Nah, no thanks, can't do it.""  and I was like, ok..  I get it.  But then another time I wanted to go to this really good authentic Korean barbeque place, and he was also like ""Nah"" and I was like ""Ok"" .. and then another time a different Asian place.  He would rather get a burger.  Ok, fine.  I like Asian food, he doesn't.  ""Except from grandma"" maybe.  I dunno.  Again, without going into detail, they have a surprisingly ""amish"" background on his father's side.  He may just like 'Merican Food.  I do know he likes Indian.  Whatever.

B came to me through a mutual friend who we both have diminished our relationships with.  She was an office mate of mine back a decade ago.  We also share a number of other mutual friends.  I invited B to my wedding, along with all of those mutual friends, and others, whom he got to know.

B was always known as a ""super nice guy"" and fun to be around.  He quips all the time, he's smart and funny, and his competitive nature works for me.  He was into chess, which I had not played in years, and drinking, which I always needed a buddy for back then.

As we went along though, there were frictions with my cats, my wife, and that B never had any money.  It was always my beer, my gas, my treat.  This was somewhat understandable because he works in non-profit, and I was making probably more than double his salary, and also my wife's income, means we make about four times what he makes, but it could build up to be annoying.

One time he greatly overstayed his welcome.  Eventually I had to ask him to leave because he just kept hanging out wayyyy to long.  But otherwise, we saw each other quite often when he lived nearby.  ""Misery loves company"" comes to mind when I think about our relationship.  He's single and I'm married, he's young and I'm old, he's broke and I'm rich (but not really, I just had a job that didn't pay diddly squat).

We do share an interest in games, music, inebriants and fire pits.  I enjoy talking to him he is a very smart guy and very creative.  As I said, he was always super nice, but right before he left he was incredibly mean.  Like ""bridge burning"" mean, when he left.  Since then we reconciled, but I don't think much has changed for him.  He currently works for DoorDash, and drives a mid-00s car.  This guy went to a TOP near-ivy university.  He could do much more for himself, but I guess living in his sister's basement is fine.

One thing about B is that he never has had a girlfriend the entire time.  Not one.  But he has had what I would describe as ""one unique odd tryst"", an ""infatuation"" and an ""undetermined outcome"" relationship.

Let me tell you about these three women he's told me about or introduced me to.

The first is a ballerina who (after he met her) had a heroin addiction.  I guess when he was in grad school he met this ballerina (Asian) and all of her friends, and then he made a mistake at a party and spent the next several years pining over what he perceived as a mistake.  He seems to think he inadvertently rejected her or something and then she rejected him.  I don't remember every specific but I remember that because he left that party, she ended up hooking up with someone else, and that person got her addicted to heroin.  After a few tumultuous years, he ""stuck by her"" but that other guy was who she got laid by all that time.  When he finally left the picture, B tried to ask her out but she softly rejected him.  ""Sorry, I just need to be alone right now"" so finally, I coaxed him to let her go.  He did this, supposedly.  I guess he never really ""ends it"" with people, especially women he wants to have sex with. I would not be surprised if he comes back to town and is like ""oh yeah I'm going to see J the ballerina"" or whatever.

The second girl is J.  I think they stopped talking at this point but who knows. So, I guess it had been a while and he got an offer to hang out with and stay with this old friend of his from Grad school who shared a similar ""musical"" connection (they were both Asian and played the cello, how stereotypical?) ... so he goes to Manhattan for a weekend but she is living with this ultra rich finance bro, and she's also a bartender.  He meets the dude, and then she takes him out to her bar where she works at.  When they get back, dude is not there.  So they hook up like completely.  And then, somehow, dude either comes home and goes to bed in a different room, or something, so she leaves him behind and goes back to her dude and then he leaves town.  But when he comes back he is all giddy and like ""she said she wants to move back here!  she's going to come move in with me!""

I'm like ""whoa hey great.. uh, you sure about that?  what happened, tell me"" and he goes on to tell the story I already told you.  Immediately my gut was like ""Sorry to break it to you man but I highly doubt she's leaving Manhattan Man and coming here with NO JOB, NO MONEY, NO BARTENDER GIG, and your crap apartment, to go back to play the cello again.  She's just nostalgic for those days and you represented that.""  Sure enough 1 day later he's like ""Well man, I got bad news..."" and of course I was right.  I enjoy being right, but I really wish he'd find a girlfriend.  At this point just for his sake, though at the time it was a way to get him moving again since we were hanging out way too often.

At least he got some play?  Anyway....

So last September was the first time I'd seen him since we had the bridge burning.  He came in for a party with our mutual friends.  It's a pool party at the end of summer.  We hang out with our old friends from college, we drink heavily, and then it's all over by 11pm because we're tired and have lives.

This year B brough this girl T.  Before I met T he was gushing about her saying he went to grad school and she runs this major nonprofit in the area and she is like really flirty, but she has a boyfriend but he's pretty sure she wants to leave him, so he's going to go for it. Of course T and her boyfriend live together. As soon as I met her, I felt like I had a better chance than he did.  I could tell that she was yes a flirty person who basically flirts with every guy she feels comfortable with.  There are a lot of dudes at the party we met her at.  Again, ""met her at"" .. for example, B would not drive with me because he might need to give T a ride home.  But then T refused to go with B and wanted to drive her own car.  So we all pulled up with 3 cars.  It was dumb.  I could tell B was on one wavelength and T was on another, and I could easily sense that.  T is dating a drummer for a band.  If you are in your early/mid-30s and you are a drummer in a band and make money then you are a professional musician.

T was definitely flirtatious.  Anyway at some point during the later part of the evening, T left.  She, having never met me before, made sure to give a big hug and kiss on the cheek.  Because she's a flirt.

So B went over and got in the hottub alone.  And I was standing there next to him, just drinking my beer, and we were talking about T and I was like .. hey yeah she's really nice and .. he's like ""I'm mad at T, she is using me, she is leading me on, yada yaa"" and I believe he actually acted this way toward her as well before she left but it was brief, and I never really saw this side of him before but I suspect it was there.... and then it happened again.  He got REALLY angry and sorta lashed out not only at T but also at me for having an opinion that T was not really interested in B.  I was able to just diffuse the situation by walking away from it, but it stuck with me because this person is extremely nice 99% of the time but there is this one streak....

He listens to a lot of music, but he is most proud of his love of metal.  Car Bomb specifically.  This guy is a very slight man, not very tall, not very hefty, not someone who would stand up in a fight with bigger people. For whatever reason though, he navigates life and people do like him, as do I, as do these women, but they don't want to get with him or be there for the long term and I think it's because he keeps following around women who are already with other people ""hoping to slip in for a chance timing"" ... or to prove to himself that he's so masterful that he can ""pull them away"" from another man.

The very first thing he ever said to me about women was after my wedding.  A few weeks after the honeymoon he came over and we were watching TV.  I turned on YouTube and I was looking for a music video I wanted him to see.  I accidentally clicked on the wrong thing and a very sexy women was singing some R&B song and he said.

""Yes that is what I like.  You know I only like them hot, right?""

For me this was an eyeroll moment.  What a teenage thing to say?  What a misogynistic thing to say? The last time I bragged to my boy about something like that I was 18. I don't get it.  But yes, he tends to like women who are thin, slight like him, Asian or white, I assume any race but who knows, and who he categorizes as ""hot"" ... but I think this is crux of his problem.  He doesn't really know women.  I find this surprising since he grew up with several women, in a bigger family, but for whatever reason I guess he never learned what he needed to?  Maybe his sisters don't relate to him about this.  I can't really tell because I was basically an only child who only later in life met his biological sister.

I feel like if I was younger, single and was still in the party scene I could have helped B, like I had many of my friends.  I was good at finding situations where people could meet.  But I didn't know B back then, I only know him now and I know I've got one hand tied behind my back when it comes to these things now.

I should mention B reminds me of an old friend of mine (my age) who as far as I know lives alone and will die alone.  Me and this old friend no longer talk and he is not on Facebook and remains rather hidden and hermit like. He only liked chasing women, he couldn't really commit to them or be a father.

I feel like B actually could be a good dad, find the right girl though, so it's not 100% similar, but there are certain things about him that do remind me of that old friend of mine.

Thoughts are appreciated.  Outside perspectives encouraged and needed.   Did you have a friend like this?  Do you see something in B that can be corrected or encouraged, discouraged?  How can we help him find his mate, who will lift him up, rather than have him run around chasing women for no reason?  Or is that all he is meant to be?  I do have a feeling it will sort itself out, but he has been in Milwaukee for some time and says there are a lot of girls there, yet does not seem to want to pursue any of them.

(This post was prompted by the fact that ""T"" is coming to ""a conference"" and will see B in Milwaukee, and I know he is trying to hook up but I'm sure she just wants to have a coffee and chat about old times.)",2,1741576675.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

December flew by, and it was filled with just good times with my girlfriend!  Despite all the cold, I felt the fire of life in me every day, because she existed, because she loved me. We talked and connected daily. We saw each other as often as possible. Sex kept getting even better. She is now… opening up! She telling me to do things I thought she was dead against! She is trying to please me. That’s true love, right? I actually turn her down as I feel time/place wasn’t ideal and if she’s gonna try new things for my sake, I want to be a good experience for her so we can repeat it. I shared with her a text message from an old neighbour/ friend that I met for coffee. Emily’s message says: “It was nice to see you smile and how your face lights up when you talked about Maggie.” I thought it was cute so I shared it. Her first response was “What did you guys do?” then “How old is Emily”  I tell her 52 I think? She send a screenshot of Emily’s Facebook! Emily’s profile pic is that of her teenage daughter in her high school band uniform. I’m getting really annoyed and I feel very disrespected. I calmly explain who she is and everything. She apologizes and says: “I’m sorry this doesn’t look very good on my part as far as trust. I’m trying my best. I understand if you’re upset with me.”  My reply: “I”m just going to look past this and have faith it will only get better with time.  I love you. I only have eyes for you. You dominate my thoughts, and I am a very loyal person. Good nigh.t” She asks if we can talk on the phone so she can explain. And she shares a screenshot of her Flo app (tracks periods) showing that she is a couple of days before it starts. (I realize it’s the same excuse was used when I was blocked the first time) She did mention in the past she gets a little irrational around that time and I better be careful. To be honest, I’ve hear a lot of girls complain about the trouble with periods. But non of them used it as an excuse to behave differently. If anything, they usually get super defensive about any claims of declined mental reasoning during that time. But who am I to judge or know, I tell her it’s ok, you apologized, I’m over it.” She adds me as follower on the Flo app so I can anticipate those days I guess! 

Maggie spent New Years Eve at my place. First time my daughter sees me with someone else that close. We had so much fun. It melted my heart again that my daughter was engaged with Maggie. They laughed and talked, and I was so surprised that my daughter opened up and shared some of her grief with her mom to Maggie! I’ve never seen her or heard to talk to someone else about such personal stuff. 



Jan 2025



Pure bless. Complete harmoney. Nothing but good times. We showered each other with love and understanding. We shared a lot. I know the kids very well by now. I even step in when the roughhousing gets out of control. I really don’t and don’t like to, but I feel like I have to sometimes. Especially the older kid, as his dad is completely absent from the picture while the youngest’s dad is still involved. So the oldest has no real male figure, and he tests his mom a lot of times. I have yet to see her get mad, or at least super firm to exact some actual discipline. But I don’t judge. I understand. I’m a single parent too, and my daughter sometimes get’s away with a lot. Out of the guilt we feel as single parents, we sometimes let them get away with things and feel bad reprimanding them. And it isn’t my place to criticize her parenting anyway. But I’d gladly give some input if asked, in the most respectful way of course. 



Feb. 13th, 2025



I was really looking forward for Valentine’s Day. Super excited to spend with my love. I got her really nice, thoughtful gifts and wrote a second nice poem. Right after work I get a call from the office that my assignment was ended. Shit now I have to find another job. Before I even process this info, I get a text from Maggie: 



“.

I went to see my doctor yesterday.

Test results came back today.

I have a yeast infection but more starting something came up positive that was previously negative before seeing you.

HPV ( Human papillomavirus) 

There’s no testing for men & usually never symptoms so it’s not your fault & I am not mad at all.

But I have made my decision to go back to celibacy.

I’m sorry. I needed to tell you now because I didn’t want to have to break this news on Valentine’s Day.

Which I don’t want or plan on celebrating.

I love you but I love my body more.

HPV is what causes cervical cancer.

I can’t let that happen. I can’t keep giving it to myself.

So I am sorry.

I wish you the best. I ask that I be left alone awhile to take care of myself & body.

\-Maggie”



I pull over so I can read it again, I can’t believe this! And I don;t know what to say back. I just say that I’m sorry; I thought I did all the tests before we even slept together. I feel bad, ashamed. If there is anything I can do let me know. I”ll leave you alone” 



Maggie: 

“I am not upset.

Yeast infection will be gone in a few days just took my pills.

& my body will clear the hpv with a healthy lifestyle & staying away from men lol.

I promise it is all good! 

I wish you the best! 

Thanks for everything.



Me:“So we are…no more?”

* “Correct”

Maggie’s text:

“So look. 

I received a false positive syphilis test.

(Going to get re-tested in one month)

I don’t care if you slept with others while you were seeing me. 

But it would be nice if you could be honest with me and let me know if there is a chance you gave me syphilis.

Thanks.” 



“You should tell your doctor & get tested too.

I was faithful the entire duration of our time seeing you.

I didn’t even talk or look at other guys.

So yes please let me know.”



Me: Never had a doubt that you were. So was I 💔I’m seeing my doctor tomorrow



Maggie: “I am done interacting and communicating with you from here on out I only unblocked your number to inform you of this test result for your own health & safety of others.

So do not contact me anymore.

Don’t leave me voicemails either.

This is done.👋”



Me: Ok. For what it’s worth, I loved. Never cheated on you. Never concealed any stds or other medical issues. I’m sorry this happened. I hope it is just a false positive for both of sakes. Take care



Me: The tests I did back in October did not include one for syphilis. But I tested negative for everything else. I am getting tested tomorrow. There are just no words that can describe the heartbreak and humiliation I feel right now. Never meant to cause you any pain.



Maggie: it is crazy. 

Just got off the phone with my mom. I never thought I would wake up to a false positive syphilis STD test. 

Well as she would tell me “ fuck around and find out”



Me: Neither of us was fucking around Megan!

  
  
  
  
  


Feb 21st, 2025



I got my tests back. There is no test for HPV for men apparently. But this time the doctor did everything, all the tests they can possibly do. All were negative. All except HSV-1 (a type of Herpes) I’m devastated beyond words. This was a nail in the coffin of our future. For some stupid reason I thought there might be still a chance to win her back despite hpv. I thought if we both got more educated about it and safe practices and maybe further tests to learn the exact strain of it, maybe we can work it out. But there is no way she is going to want to ouch me again with Herpes!  How is that even possible, I never had any symptoms, and I’m always safe. The doctor explained that the test effectively found anti-bodies for HSV-1, meaning that at one point in my life I was exposed to it. No telling when or where. 



Now I have a very difficult decision to make. Tell her about it or not? I mean she is leaving me anyway, might as well save some face and keep that disgraceful info to myself. But then again, I’m not a 100% sure she tested herself fo it last time, and even if she did, she might need to do it again in a few weeks to make sure. I remind myself that I love her, I want what’s best for her, and I want to DO THE RIGHT THING. Damn it. I ask if we can talk over th phone, she declines. I break the good news (no Syphilis) and the bad ones (HSV-1). 

  


Ok, well, I really wanted to do the right thing and deliver this news in and apologize in person. Here are the rest of my tests. I dk all the details yet, I still need to talk to my doctor. I truly regret not meeting you sooner. I truly regret not being  more vigilant in my tests last time. Call your mom to calm down or even call me if you need someone to talk to over this before midnight. Because I will be blocking and deleting your number after midnight tonight. But if ever get in a real jam, and all of your options of help were exhausted, find me somehow, I’ll still help, no questions asked. 

I learned a few very valuable lessons here that will stay with me for ever. 

I pray our paths never cross again, but if they ever do, you’ll only see a smile of someone who truly knows what a blessing it was to be in your embrace.

Get well, stay well, and move on.

She shares with me that her herpes test all came back negative. I’m relieved, but I tell her she should probably test again in a month just to be sure. 



Maggie: “Don’t be hard or hate yourself.

It’s not your fault that my body just doesn’t agree with your body chemistry.

I am not upset. I don’t hate you.

( I don’t hate anybody in my life)

I truly wish you nothing but the best.

You are a good person.”



March, 2025



I’ve been foggy for a month. I remember being so numb right after the breakup. I refused to cry. Until I woke up with tears. I didn’t know one could cry in the middle of sleeping! That’s new. 

I go through a cycle of emotions: sadness, anger, despair, acceptance, hope, disbelief. Hope is the most dangerous one, and I needed to squash it. But it just creeps on you sometimes. Especially when you relive the memories and the words they said to you. My attachment to her is not healthy.  I go through the entire cycle of human emotions, except for hate. I never could hate her, and believe me, I tried. 

Drunk and high later that night, scrolling on Youtube, and a random video about atheists played. I drunkenly lifted my head and said, “Fine, show me you exist, and bring her back.” I’ll spend some serious effort seeking you; just prove it. It’s pathetic what love can do to you! 

I accept my part and the pain and stress I caused her. But I truly think I also didn't deserve to be treated like that by her at the end. I had nothing but good intentions. And I truly loved her, and I still do. But I understand, given everything I know about her, and seeing that we are, after all humans; it is so much easier to move on with a little bit of hate. So if she needs to hate me, be it. I’d rather her feel anger than feeling helpless and heartbroken. It is easier to deal with it when there is someone to blame, I guess. 

I gathered everything she ever gave me in a bag, along with her V-Day gifts, and tucked it away in a closet. I don’t have the heart to throw it away yet. 

I don’t know why I’m writing all of this, this love story is not unique or special in any way. I guess it’s my way of dealing with it. But I needed to share it, and I need to be understood.



She called me Babe (not a big fan as me ex used to call me that but I never corrected her), and I called her Love, because I hate Babe, and I love her



If I could talk to her now, I would say: 



Love….

I’m so sorry. I know you were hurt, maybe even heartbroken. I understand that you probably felt cheated or betrayed. But you were not. At least not by me. 

I had both hpv and HSV-1 way before I met you. And I never knew. I thought I was careful by testing before I made love to you. But there are no tests for hpv, and as I was recently told, doctors don’t typically test for Herpes unless there is a reason. I could’ve had both years before I met you. I could’ve had both since 1998, when you were still a baby and I was just a kid, the first time someone touched me. But it doesn't matter. I’m just upset that I subjected you to this stress. I know it isn't easy for you with your anxiety. But allow me to say that you should probably talk to more people about it and get as much info as possible. Seeing how prevalent it is, and with all due respect, given your age and situation, it doesn't matter who you meet next, there is always a chance of something similar happening. Don't lose out on true love again out of fear. No one is perfect, and we all have our baggage and “conditions”. It could be Asthma, allergies, depression, diabetes, or anything! We all have something going on, I have to accept that I have those “conditions” now and work on managing them. Just like you filtered out of your life the men who treat you like a “fuckdoll or a cum rag” be in your life (your words), you have to filter out what’s good with the good ones. It’s going to be hard, not impossible, but very hard to find someone who loves and accepts you the way I did. But you deserve nothing less. I hope you never forget or doubt that, 



I understand that your past experiences with men affected you, but I’ve shown you nothing but true love. At least I tried; I truly tried my best. I’m sorry I’m not perfect. 

But you are not perfect either. And I loved you with all your flaws, and there were some. I understand the coldness and cruelty you showed at the end, and I forgive it, but I will never forget it. Just know this: if the roles were reversed, I’d have stayed. If I had to leave, I would have let you down easy and respectfully. I would have never questioned your loyalty or integrity. You’ve given me no reason to, just as I have given no reason to questions mine. But you did anyway. And that hurt more than anything else. 

Maybe we came into each other’s life so we can both be reminded that we are not hopeless when it comes to love. 



To quote others:

“I’m happy that I met you, and got to fall in love with you. Because even though the heartbreak felt it like it was absolutely destroying me inside, When I’m healed and all better, I can look back and say that I experienced a love like that.”



“You're still my person even if I'm not yours I'll keep you as my favorite incomplete wish. 

Our story is finished,  but the chapters we've written together will forever echo in my heart.

Every memory we created, every laugh we shared, and every tear we shed has woven a tapestry of love that time cannot erase. I cherish the bond we have, understanding that sometimes, love means letting go to allow both of us to grow and find our true parts in life. You will always be a part of who I am. I'll hold on to the hope that our incomplete wish will someday find its fulfillment in ways we can't yet imagine with someone else, someone better.  Until then, know that you are deeply loved and profoundly missed and will forever hold a special place in my heart.”



 “I do believe it's true

That there are roads left in both of our shoes

But if the silence takes you

Then I hope it takes me too

So brown eyes, I hold you near

'Cause you're the only song I want to hear”

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere.”



“And think not you can direct the course

of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.

 	Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.

 	But if you love and must needs have

desires, let these be your desires:

 	To melt and be like a running brook

that sings its melody to the night.

 	To know the pain of too much tenderness.

 	To be wounded by your own under-

standing of love;

 	And to bleed willingly and joyfully.

 	To wake at dawn with a winged heart

and give thanks for another day of loving;

 	To rest at the noon hour and meditate

love’s ecstasy;

 	To return home at eventide with grati-

tude;

 	And then to sleep with a prayer for the

beloved in your heart and a song of praise

upon your lips.”

If you read all of this, I truly appreciate you sticking through this sappy and pathetic story. But I need you to tell me what you think. Pick any of the below, or all if you feel like it. Don't spare my feelings; let me have it. But before you call me a SIMP or question my masculinity ( Imean I clearly have issues too), please understand that I am 40, and I’ve played the game with the ladies and acted like a confident hot-shit asshole, and hooked up and slept around, Whatever part of me comes across as super soft in this story, it was intentional! I purposefully chose to show my vulnerabilities with Maggie. I wanted this to be different, sincere, and meaningful. Did not perform or withhold any words or actions in favor of scoring pints or painting myself in a different light. Call it a failed experiment?

1j7pbpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1j7pbpg/how_to_recover_from_mobbing/,How to recover from mobbing?,"I don't even know were to begin. I'm in healthcare. I started on this place as a resident and since the beginning, I felt excluded. 

I stayed. I needed the money. My dad was going through a divorce and I couldn't change locations. I made a complaint, but nothing happened. They made it look like everything was fine, and honestly, in healthcare residents exist to fill unwanted places, to do unwanted job for a low pay grade. So they (both offices) really didn't care. 

I am ashamed to admit I got used to it. I tried every way that I could to get certifications, doing courses, getting involved, I had a social life outside of work and that saved me for a while. I got through the 3 years and with time they actually realised that if anything I was useful. And then they asked me to stay. 

By this point my dad got a cancer diagnosis. He had been getting sick often lately. He was alone back at home and it worried me. My plans after I finished were to leave the country, for good. But I couldn't. Not with my dad sick. So I took the position. There was promise of me being coordinator of the section of my interest. Which was the largest. 

At this point, I had some colleagues that had warmed up to me, or so I had thought. I got a formal job at this place, a second job at a known private clinic by recommendation of someone who ended up knowing me from courses and internships related to my residency. I got into a program for a postgraduate, that was a highlight: I was selected from a bunch of people. I didn't even think I had a chance. 

By this point, since I had decided to stay, some people were not happy with me staying. I had not said a word about my second job and the post graduate. But eventually word got out and I could feel it. People who never cared to talk to me started conversations just so I would recommend them to work at this place. People who knew I was after this postgraduate, got a surprise when they heard that I got in. And they stood silent. Like ""first class' on Friday"", ""I know, I got the email"". And then 😨. Not that they got the email, they just wanted to rub it in that I wasn't selected when I had actually been selected. 

When I got in, I was supposed to stay in the morning shift. But they needed people on the ER shift. And there was extra compensation, and I wanted to save. 

The first sign that they didn't like me was that they mainly saw me as someone from the morning shift, invading them. They wouldn't speak to me. They automatically didn't like me. I didn't even know a thing about them since they wouldn't talk to me. Honestly, the most I know about them was from a third person view, since everyone gossiped about everyone. 

That was for 4 years like that. In the middle of that, COVID happened and that was the worst bit because they put me to work alongside someone who already hated me, who would not speak to me at all and would leave me alone at my work station. She wouldn't collaborate with me and behind my back she would trash talk about me. I honestly don't know what was it that bothered her so much. I ended up asking to not put me with her since it was awful to spend time around someone who treats you like that. 

After that, some new people got in. And they were fine with me, but I could tell that after that, if they shared shifts with someone else, their stance would change with me. I tried to ask, and they didn't have an answer and that everything was fine. I told my boss and she told me it was because they shared shifts with this other person I didn't shared says with anymore. I felt more and more excluded. We were in groups of 3, it made me feel insane. 

This dynamic got worse once my dad died. I was mourning, devastated, and I was only having interactions with friends and family. My birthday came in, less than 2 months afters his death and I wasn't having much of a party, just lunch's at home or brunch somewhere nice. But these 2 women kept insisting to go for coffee and I kept telling them no. They texted me, they insisted we never went anywhere and I told them we could buy something to have at the hospital. But they kept insisting, ""let's go somewhere nice"". And I ended up saying yes. But they never showed. They told me something else came up and they forgot to tell me. Of course they were lying. Why wait till 15 minutes after meetup time to say anything? A few weeks ago, someone confirmed: they never wanted to go grab coffee with me, they just wanted to stood me up. 

I didn't know what to do at the time. I was bewildered. I told my colleagues at my second job what had happened and they were dead cold on the spot. ""You don't do that, to anyone. It's so easy to text someone. That's so cheap"". After that I stopped sharing time with them at all. They told everyone that I was crazy and didn't know why I was being dismissive with them. At this point I had told my boss. She knew I was struggling with my dad's passing. It felt beyond cruel. I felt so small. I felt even worse because I couldn't get over it. ""It's not my fault"". But it didn't work.

Several other things were going on by then. I could tell people were talking behind my back. The worst thing that made me a target was that previous to her promotion, I was friends with my boss. We would go shopping, to grab coffee, have lunch. We never shared anything on social media. But somehow people knew anyway. 

It was a year of this and I chose to resign my second job at the clinic. It was becoming too much, and by this point I had comeback to sessions my therapist because of my dad's death, I had so much shit going on with family after dad died, I couldn't move on. I didn't really spoke of work, mostly family. I took everything like it was childish games, but I hadn't considered that I was becoming increasingly used to their humiliations. 

In January 2024, I felt an increase in the aggressions. Nothing I did was OK. If I picked up the phone, if I didn't, if I asked before, if I didn't, if I was in the bathroom I had left my workplace abandoned, so imagine me warning them I had to go to the bathroom just so they wouldn't become belligerent with me and start screaming at me for not being there. I told my boss and she did confirmed it: ""they're isolating you, nothing you'll do will be ok. They don't like you and it's because they gossip about you 24/7, you're their scapegoat"". After that it didn't even make a difference if I told my boss what they did to me. If I faced them myself they would laugh at my face and play dumb. 

Fast forwards 2 years and I'm struggling with daily life. I almost have no social life. It evaporated. I get a consultation with a psychiatrist and he tells me ""you're being harrased at your job"" in my second session. I cried for 3 days straight. I started pushing to be moved someplace else. Somewhere else. But my boss wouldn't have it. By this point I had had it with her. I had started feeling used and I questioned if she was really my friend. I had been pinned as a problematic person and I couldn't shake it.

After a final instance, I present a complaint. And I did get my move. But: they wouldn't have it go through main channels. They had me in a second reunion with a lawyer, my boss (who denied everything), and the subdirector, telling me that if I continued course with he complaint, it could backfire since my colleagues could testify against me. By this point I didn't care. I wanted to leave. It was an ambush. Of course it was. 

It's been 6 weeks since I left. And I'm struggling. I feel like I am nothing. It was my birthday again and I didn't have the strength to make anything at all. I just curled in a ball and cried. 

I am even more offended that this isn't punished by law. I feel decimated. I feel guilt. I feel put aside. I want retributions but it would only ruin me. Sadly I feel like maybe the mods won't allow a post this long to stay live and shut it down.

In the last 10 years I have whittled down from a 2k square foot house in LA and an entertainment industry job, down to a camper in an oak forested property with only containers of water and 2 electric 100W generators, and my Volvo. The next two months are dedicated to liquidating what’s left in my storage (it’s only a 10x10 half full) and then it’s time for the next chapter. 10 years ago I had a dream of a tiny home and a lot of green space, but could hardly stomach the idea of shedding the accoutrements of city life. Little by little I have evaluated all the objects that made up my life and let them go. Gradually those layers have fallen away and now the best things in life are the natural world around me.  
Here’s a brief history: Graduated high school with a year of college already complete and admission to UC Berkeley. (I did not attend Berkeley because I was basically financially blocked by my extremely dysfunctional divorced parents. I really want a cooperative work and life relationship now.)  Went to community college for 6 years on my own, took botany, fashion design, auto shop, art history, sociology, film, everything. The sewing class came in handy when I started working as a costumer and seamstress on sets for TV commercials. I became a workaholic. I had an extra curricular dancing in vaudeville style old timey entertainment shows with a very fun crowd of counter culturistas in Hollywood. After 12 years hustling at 12-14 hour days and lots of partying I was burned out. The housing market crash happened, not much work was available, and I fell under the income threshold for a grant. I got into Berkeley again, and UCLA, and I chose UCLA to be near my friends, and finished my degree in Art History.    
I always had a loose relationship with my family, as everyone was left to figuring out things on their own with no support, now most of them have died and I no longer have any close relatives.  
So at the moment, I’m not really off-grid, since here I am online, and I really enjoy watching a new indie film I’ve downloaded, spending the day at the local library browsing and reading, or lounging outside enjoying the incredible California weather. I can drive about 15 minutes and I’m in a small local town here. But I have no long term placement or plan, and I crave at least a part-time interaction with someone who loves a beautiful sunrise, listening to songbirds, and talking about news articles or books over cup of coffee as much as I do. I also want more physical work and more activity in my future. I want animals to take care of and food to prep. I really wouldn’t mind some half grown kids around either, for weekend amateur theatrical plays, jam bands, philosophical discussions, reading stories, telling jokes, and liveliness.  
After I left entertainment I took a bunch of different “average person” jobs to see what it was like for “average people“ who settle into a regular job. I volunteered working on a brigantine for 6 months which was very fun and I’d love more sailing time.  I worked at the state park minding parking lots then doing maintenance. I found that the reason mostly college students and retirees do those jobs is because it doesn’t pay the rent. It was great being out in a green space all day but the money doesn’t cover living expenses. I tried restaurant work for a couple years and really enjoyed being on my feet and interacting with customers. I looked forward to seeing my regulars and I love running around all day. It kept my weight down and my mind busy. I did not love the dysfunctional personal dynamics and the strict adherence to social hierarchy with my co-workers. I saw no reason for people to be at odds all day but this is what I encountered in hotels and restaurants, so I let that go after a couple years, and now I’m selling goods online. I worked for a contractor for a short to learn some things. I can install drywall and frame out a door! Would still love to learn about electricity. I’m basically a blunt talking red head with very feminine figure but I’ve always been interested in construction and fixing stuff.   
I‘m a hard worker, inventive, efficient, a problem solver, and great at handling surprise things that come up. I have a gallows sense of humor regarding humans and a ridiculous amount of empathy and affection for other living things. I need to be around animals to be fulfilled In life, and having a cat is a must. I want to grow food and I will also grow flowers.  Am so down to compost and also help fix the building if it’s breaking and the plumbing if it’s leaking. I like being around people who can have lively discussions but also enjoy being together without the constant need to talk.  
We are on the verge of WWIII and I really want out of the US as soon as possible. Human rights are quickly being eroded here. The feeling in my gut is telling me to get away from the US and need to leave before the next war breaks out. I am afraid to be in the US  any longer. I already felt that it was time to move on to the next thing and now this is giving me the urgency to make that move.   
If there are any non-hetero homesteaders out there who want a very liberally minded “ranch mom” around I am so down!  

It is probably a little silly to think about a romantic prospect in this format or venue, but if anyone needs a grown woman around to help out and work together, maybe something beautiful could follow in time. For now, I’d love the experience if you need someone able, alert  and capable. ",1,1741576216.0,HomesteadSingles,0,1.0,False

Tips weren't great but I got to work with my best friend, so I was down. Hourly is decent(ish) but take home between tips/hourly is hardly anything to boast about, and way less than my actual bartending job.
It's private owned and the cleanup was excessive, we had to help the assistants clean the venue after cleaning the bar, then had to stack chairs and tear down tables, clean bathrooms, put away coffee service, bring decor to the garages, etc. This takes an extra 1-1.5hrs AFTER the bar was done, sometimes 2 hours. 
Now the owners are opening up again for the season and have their own goblets, plates, chargers, silverware, and cups. Bartenders are in charge of washing it all, then putting it in storage. On top of everything else we already do.
There are venue assistants scheduled, but they tend to skimp on scheduling them and say that they don't need as many because bartenders can help too.
Is this really crazy!? As someone who has bartended for years I'm used to cleaning up a huge mess from busy nights, I've worked hotel bars that had us cleaning the pool at the end of the night, I've had to help servers with their closing before, too. but this feels way, way beyond anything I'd want to do.

1j7p2zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j7p2zf/bedbugs/,Bedbugs?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now. I’ve had a few relationships when I was younger, but I wouldn’t have considered any of those highschool and college flings serious, especially after having been with Cindy. 

I met Cindy for the first time at a local cider mill. I visit every year to stock up on donuts, jams, and honey as my own little tradition. It was during a tour of the beekeeper’s beehives where I first saw her among a group of friends; short cropped black hair and sunglasses that worked poorly to hide her bubbly personality. She wore a gorgeous red jewel necklace that matched her enveloping brown eyes. Her smile captured me the moment I caught a glimpse of it. She stood out like a bold and beautiful queen bee among the tour group as she watched the bees extract nectar from patches of lavender.

I moved closer and closer to her as the tour went on, ultimately wooing her the moment I spoke my first words to her. 

“If we had some birds around here we could really make this a party.”

Looking back, that was probably the stupidest pick-up line I could’ve used at that moment. Somehow she liked it, and even better than that, she liked me. We hit it off right from the start. Several dates later and I agreed to move in with her, which may have been an odd decision to most after only going on several dates. She was the one that proposed the idea. The chemistry between us was nothing I had ever felt before. I truly thought she was my soulmate.

Cindy’s apartment is small. Roughly 600 square feet of bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living room. Vintage wooden furniture filled the space. I didn’t consider any of this when I moved all my stuff from my parents home into her place. Since she lived there first, I would’ve been fine if she told me to throw a few pieces of clashing IKEA  furniture and childhood knicknacks away, but she was surprisingly accepting of keeping it all.  

The night I moved in with Cindy was the first night I slept in her bed. The thought that lucked me to sleep as I laid next to her was ‘I’m so lucky to be with this woman’.

 I had awoken to the smell of bacon. Realizing Cindy was already up, I got out of bed and took off my pajamas to get changed. My wrist felt irritated as I was taking off my shirt.  I noticed an inch sized red spot on the side of my wrist. It was inflamed and itchy. 

When I was a child it wasn’t uncommon for my skin to break out in hives from stress. The breakouts decreased as I got older, and before I met Cindy, it had been over half a decade since hives appeared on my skin. I chalked it up to being stressed from moving and put on a long sleeve shirt for the day. As the nights went on the red spots continued to appear. It wasn’t a common breakout area like hives. It was singular spots at random around my body. It seemed like every time I woke up in that bed I’d gain a new irritated splotch of red on my body. I don’t know if it was making me depressed or something, but since they were showing up I was sleeping more often. It wasn’t uncommon for Cindy to wake me up from a nap and tell me to eat some snacks to energize myself.

I would have brought this up to Cindy but I think it would’ve made her go crazy. Once, earlier in our relationship when I hadn’t moved in yet, we were hanging out on the bed in her bedroom  just talking and listening to music. She began screaming. I had never heard anyone scream that loud before. I nearly fell off the bed trying to get away from whatever she was screaming at. Really manly of me, I know. I was yelling back at her in a panic asking what was happening. 

“It’s a bug!” She announced, recoiling away and pointing at the center of the bed.

I took a closer look. It was a stinkbug, fairly common where we lived and entirely harmless. She wanted to kill it but I told her it would make her room smell atrocious. It took some convincing for her to let me wrap it in a paper towel and toss it out the window like I was returning a fish to the ocean. After I shut the window I asked her why she was so afraid of bugs.

“I’m not afraid of bugs.” She replied with a shakiness still lingering in her voice. 

“Just bedbugs. If I see anything small scurrying across my sheets I just get flashbacks to when I was younger. I had a bedbug infestation in my room and my mom threw everything away. Everything. My clothes, my books, family photos. All gone. My life was thrown away and I don’t want to experience that again.”

Cindy had told me other stories about her mom. She wasn’t necessarily what you’d call a role model parent. In fact, she wasn’t even in contact with her anymore. When I saw those spots on my body I remembered the day she shared her fears and refrained from telling her about the implications of my issue. I figured I would deal with it on my own.

After a few weeks or so of new spots appearing I caved in and bought a bottle of bedbug spray. I did research, too. Making sure I was getting my money's worth on the most lethal concoction available to mow down the little bastards. After patiently waiting for a day Cindy would be at work and I would be at the apartment alone, I rigorously vacuumed not just the bedroom but the entire apartment I shoved the sheets, covers, and pillowcases into the washer and then sanitized the hell out of them in the dryer. 

Hopefully 1,000rpm’s along with being cooked alive would kill anything that inhabited our bedding. I did the same with all of our clothes too. I didn’t care if the utility bill came back higher than usual. If questions arose I’d just say I left the faucet running on accident.

As everything was washing and drying I doused our bedroom a few times over with the bug spray. It may have been excessive, but part of me regretted not purchasing a second bottle. Before Cindy returned home I had fixed our bed and stored all of our clothes away exactly how they were previously. Our bed looked so fresh it was hard to resist taking another nap. I thought I would clean up the rest of the apartment since Cindy reminded me some friends, the ones she was with at the cider mill actually, would be over for a small party. I don’t know exactly what they did because I was out with my own friends that night drinking. 

I had only been out an hour and I began feeling lethargic again. After some bargaining with my friends who begged me to stay out longer, I decided to head back home early. When I got home Cindy was cleaning up the party’s aftermath. She didn’t save any of the fruit punch jungle juice for me since I had already had plenty to drink tonight, but that red nectar looked delicious as it went down the drain. She was adamant on thanking me for how clean and organized the apartment looked. But none of it mattered.

The next morning I hurried to the bathroom after my girlfriend had gone to work. Inspecting my back carefully in the mirror, I found another new red spot. I felt like I was going crazy. Anytime from then on I would become anxious spotting anything from dust to dirt on our bedspread, ravenously looming over it like a cat hunting prey.

We showered together that night. She had no red spots. I asked her if she could look at mine.

“You would get those when you were a kid, right? Wasn’t it from stress?”

She was right, I have been stressed due to the whole bedbug thing, and it made it worse that I couldn’t tell her. But I started getting the spots before I was stressed. Unless I could see into the future, it didn’t make sense to me. Saying goodnight to my girlfriend, we tucked ourselves into bed and I faced away from her. I didn’t want her to see my tears. I felt like I failed her.

Paranoid, I couldn’t sleep. Any minor itch on my body ramped up my anxiety. Feeling the individual hairs on my arms and legs rub against the comforter felt like armies of microscopic bugs marching across my skin. Why me? Why did they only want me? I heard her moving around under the covers. Something cold touched my back.

 A sheer stabbing pain.

I squirmed away ravenously and hoisted the covers off me, turning on the bedside lamp. I saw my girlfriend with a syringe in her hand and blood dripping off its metal tip.

“Cindy, what the fuck!?”

She stared at me with a look of what seemed like betrayal.

“You… you don’t love me?”

She immediately began crying, raising the syringe by her head as she balled up. I had never in the span of our relationship seen her so frantically depressed. I was afraid yet wanted to comfort her. Until she gathered herself. Her mood switched instantaneously to resentment. She jumped at me and we fell off the bed. The fall must have winded her because I sprinted outside in my pajamas and ran to a 24/7 diner.

I’m trying to get this all down over a cup of coffee and thought it would help me to share this. I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t have any idea what she would want with my blood and why she would hide this from me for so long. I think her friends just walked in. They all have the same jewelry she had on now. i might just be seeing things that remind me of her, but I also can’t get that look of anger and resentment in her face. I’m so tired I think I’m gonna finish up writing here and ask her friends what’s going on.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I used to give that speech myself about leads, before I even knew about Glengarry. I had agents just like that, not calling leads and I probably paid just as much as Mitch & Murray if not more.","I used to always say ""They are trying to give you their money!"", but in a much nicer way than how the guys from Downtown and Mitch & Murray said it.

It always baffled me that agents would waste leads.

Now, the real estate world has come a long way since Mitch & Murray.

There are CRMs out there that send drip campaigns.  I still can't get most of my agents in my office to use them.  It drives me bananas.  I'm finally going to have to set up a companywide campaign myself after all of this time.

I had that same set up.  Coffee machine, goody table that I used to stack up with a selection of chocolates.  I never told anyone to put the coffee down, but I scratched my head when agents would burn leads. 

The truth is, there are agents in situations out there where they actually have a lead flow and are burning them, not setting up drip campaigns. 

Some of these buyers might not buy for 2-3 years from now.  A CRM will help you stay in front of them. 

You can't expect to talk to a lead once, and then expect that lead to call you 3 years down the line.  There is a lot of competition in the industry now and many agents are setting up these drip campaigns through Follow Up Boss, Constant Contact, Mailchimp etc.

And then of course, there's guys like Richard Roma.  Everything they touch turns to gold.  I still live this to this day, this is my reality.  I have Richard Romas coming in and are like walking cash registers, and I have another agent telling me the leads aren't answering, the leads are weak, the leads are wasting their time (and they are on the same exact leads as everywhere else).     
  
You don't know how bad I'd love to have someone come in from Downtown to talk to them about this.

Anyway, I can't wait to have some laughs on Broadway.  But at the same time, the laughs on me for living this every day.

1j7ozs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j7ozs3/i_dont_know_how_to_leave_my_job_caring_for_the/,I don't know how to leave my job caring for the elderly,"Of course some details will be changed or left out for privacy purposes.  
TLDR: Working for an elderly couple is harming my health, and their children won't intervene



I am in my early twenties and I have a degree in a specialized field that is portfolio focused and who you know is very important. At the moment, most of my income comes from my job taking care of an elderly couple. The income I make from my field isn't consistent, but I make enough that you would otherwise consider it a good ""side gig"". However, I'd like to eventually turn it into a career. Financially, I cannot pay my bills without the elderly couple, but I have savings that would last me about 6 months.

I do not provide medical care, but without me they would not be able to live on their own. They lived the typical life in the 1980s of Husband makes money, Wife is the homemaker (except they had the finances to have everything cared for), and they have 4 kids. The two oldest are financially and have stable careers (lawyer and doctor), the two youngest have had many problems and one has been draining their account with medical bills due to disability and unfortunately greed. Because of this, there's lots of tension between the children and their parents. Often, I am the one who is put in the middle and has caused me lots of anxiety and stress. 

  
By today's standards, their relationship has been built off verbal abuse from the wife and financial abuse from the husband. The wife has no understanding of finances and has basically never done anything for herself. For example, she can't use the coffee machine. air fryer, or a computer. She is physically unwell as she struggles to walk and has issues with incontinence. The husband takes care of everything, but he has been cognitively declining over the years.



 Since COVID their entire life seems to be have gone off the rails. He made some poor financial decisions and lost most of their money in one large asset. Their habits are that of affluent people. They've been throwing around money for as long as I've been with them and accrued a lot of debt from their children and borrowing from their estate. It feels like I'm the only one helping them fix it which has taken a toll on my health. I and other people who work for them have expressed our concern, but none of the kids are willing to step in. They help from afar, usually by telling their parents what to do, and the husband and wife often don't do it. This has dug them into a hole of resentment with their children and each other. 

  
Last year the husband suffered from a severe health event that almost killed him. Since then, he has been unable to get anything involving their finances and bills done. Through therapy I have set some boundaries because they want me to ""help"" (I'm doing way more than that) with their finances, estate, bills, health, and everything you can think of besides giving them medical treatment. 

  
Unfortunately, I feel working with them is the only thing keeping them independent and without me they will collapse. I have mentioned they need more help than I can provide, and I have set some boundaries regarding their finances, but it hurts. They love me like a granddaughter, and they're very flexible with my schedule and my needs. Unfortunately, I feel that its harming me in my career and its harming my health.

me and my boyfriend have been together for almost two years, and we’ve been living together for a year. he comes from a very catholic family (church every sunday, heavily involved with it, both parents teach religious classes, respects saving himself for marriage even though we live together) - he is everything i want and more, and i love him so very much. i’m posting this here just because i want to try and make our bond even stronger by being more accepting to people he cares about. our relationship came from a beautiful friendship and we knew eachother years before getting romantically involved.

i love his family, they love me and i love his high school friends and his hometown friends. the problem lies within his university group of friends. i have been very clear about putting boundaries with people of opposite sex - especially the ones we met after getting together. when he went to uni, he met a few guys and a few girls and would often skip out on seeing me (he lived in another city but would come to mine for uni, still wouldn’t see me) because he’d grab a coffee or a beer with them, and there was a time where he played a game of smash and pass with a few of his guy friends and said he’d smash one of the girls in the friendgroup. after i asked some stupid questions i didn’t even want the answers to, he told me about the game and that was our one and only fight to this day. for a man who praises the lord, goes to church every sunday, and saves himself for marriage, i found it very disturbing to say that he would smash a girl (and i feel that way both out of jealousy cus she’s everything i’m not and out of sheer disrespect towards me, the one he gave a promise ring to).

after that particular event, i cried and cried and cried. i felt awful because she looked nothing like me and because i thought i was the only one he’d want to make love to. i know now that it isn’t as deep as that, but i wanted a man with my morals, and i thought that if he ever participated in immature conversations like that one that he would say something like “i have a girlfriend, i don’t want to answer that”. because wdym you said pass for 4 girls and one of them was a smash? and that one was the only girl i didn’t meet out of all of them? the one he sits next to in class, the one he drives with to uni.

afterwards we talked. i told him i feel very disrespected by it and that i don’t want him hanging around women i don’t know and didn’t meet. try to get me and your girl friends in the same room, take us all out to a bar, let me meet them and judge if i feel comfortable or not. he said the girls and uni don’t matter at all to him and he likes the guys, but the guys know the girls from high school so that’s why he hangs out with them. he cried and told me that he doesn’t want to hurt me with his stupid comments ever again. now he doesn’t hang with girls anymore (he says hi and that’s it) and that automatically means he doesn’t hang out with his guy friends as much as he did before which i feel sad about, and want to change.

there were a few instances after that where i felt disrespected by his guy friends. i went to an event just with my bf and his guy friends once and that was it. one hang with them and few random encounters on other events. these are the guys he skates with, goes to lectures with, talks with. the guys that still play smash or pass at their grown age like they’re 16. and i wouldn’t hold that against them anymore if i had a chance to meet them, to see how my man behaves around them, if his brain cells meet theirs when they’re together. and when i say that to my bf he says that i wouldn’t like the guys. so i’ll marry you one day in the near future, and you’re going to invite your “best friends” that i hung with once?? while he’s always around my friends, from middle school, high school, other countries. the only friends of his that i met, i met on my own from even before we got together.

one of his guy friends hosted a party at his place and invited my boyfriend, to which he replied “i’m not going to be there unfortunately unless my lady is coming too” and his guy friend replied to him that there’s not enough space for me. but the day after i saw that a guy he met once, one of my friends, was there along with his two plus one’s. and my bf couldn’t bring his longterm gf he lives with and gave a promise ring to?

how do i help this if he doesn’t want me to meet them? i don’t want to nag him all the time when he’s out with them but how do i trust my man with guys that act like they’re 16 and act petty because he doesn’t hang with random women anymore? i want to improve myself for him and i love him so very much, but these friends of his give me a hard time.

1j7orcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/torties/comments/1j7orcp/please_tell_me_stories_about_your_girls_being_so/,"Please tell me stories about your girls being so intelligent and yes, manipulative, you started to think ""Is this cat a human trapped in a tiny little peanut butter cup cat's body?""","My 11-year-old girl, Arya, is the most intelligent animal I've ever met. I both admire and fear her, and I tell her this almost daily. She rules my home with an iron paw, and despite being like 5 pounds, she has been the alpha with both male cats I have had during her reign, despite both being hefty boys over twice her size. 

A now-ex-boyfriend once dared to close the door of my bedroom after I fell asleep when he was spending the night. The door always previously remained open for cat access. The litter box was in the hallway, so the cats were not cut off from it all night while the door was closed. When I opened it in the morning, Arya was right there. She looked at me, strolled in, took a shit in the middle of my bedroom floor, and waltzed out. I've had this cat since she was 4-months-old and not once has she taken a shit outside of the litter box besides this one time. Not before and not since. In over 11 years. The door was never closed again. 

My baby girl loves chicken. I mean, bitch is crazy about chicken. I was having chicken and rice one night and she was near me, but she didn't look like she was plotting anything. The SECOND I turned my head, she snatched the chicken and ran. She took that chicken to a second location so fast. She was WAITING for me to turn my head! 

When I tell you she is food motivated, I mean that is her only motivation. Food and spite, I guess. She is constantly asking for food and is only satisfied when both cat bowls have food in them. If only one does, she is NOT happy. And I know it's not because she has any concern about my other cat because she does not. He worships her and she is disgusted by what she perceives to be his lack of self-respect because he lets people hold him, meows on command, and lets people put hats and clothes on him, while she is naked and ungovernable. 

She will knock things down unless I deposit the food in the bowls right there and then. I also lack self-respect so I give in and put tiny little spoonfuls of food in throughout the day so this whole thing is honestly all my fault. I do my work and online schooling on the couch so I sit there for most of the day. First she'll start by standing on the coffee table in front of me and meowing (meows are reserved for begging for food ONLY). If that doesn't work, she'll lift up her little paw and start the Cup Demolition Process. She does it slowly, like a threat, before she goes all in. I'll see the little paw lift up a little and say ""Arya! Don't!"" and she'll put it down like she wasn't doing anything. This will repeat until I fill up the bowls. Nothing will stop it. If it goes on too long, she does it a little faster so I know she means business. She'll eventually knock the cup over and then run away. My mother came to visit once and witnessed it herself and found it hilarious. IT IS NOT HILARIOUS, MOTHER. IT IS MY EVERY DAY LIFE. 

Anyway, I'm sorry this is so long. I just needed to vent to the only people who would understand what it's like to have one of these sassy evil genius divas in their home. Please tell me stories about your girls being scarily intelligent, deliberate, manipulative, human-like, and vengeful. ",2,1741574714.0,torties,0,1.0,False

Story time—

I used to work at Starbucks, left on good terms, and was even told I could come back anytime. Recently, I decided to reapply. I applied to my old store and another one I had helped out at before. My former manager said she’d reach out when she was hiring again—cool, I could wait.

A couple of months passed with no word, so I followed up with a text to let her know I applied. Left on read for a month. I got the hint and applied to the other store. A shift lead I was close with assured me I’d get the job since they were desperately hiring—like, “closed due to no employees” levels of desperate.

I spoke to the manager in person, and after realizing I’d only been gone for two months, she gave me a mini-interview on the spot. She said she just needed to confirm my rehire status and would call me soon to move forward. Instead of a call, I got an automated rejection email.

I called to double-check my rehire status, and they confirmed I’m rehireable. But here’s the kicker: every time I apply, I get an interview with a manager who assures me all’s good, and then—radio silence. This has happened five times at every Starbucks within a 20-minute drive, leaving me feeling like I’m applying into a void.

Out of desperation, I applied to a different coffee franchise and was hired on the spot. Thank god, my bank account had literally $0.01, and I only made it to the interview on hopes and dreams.

Has anyone else experienced this with Starbucks? Is there some unspoken internal policy I’m missing? 

Side note: I ran into serious issues at that store—a problematic shift lead and zero support from my manager—which forced me to report the incident to ethics. It got so bad that ethics even asked for the manager’s name. I chose not to be anonymous in my pursuit of justice, but in hindsight, trusting HR ethics might have been a mistake.

TLDR: I was told I’m rehireable at Starbucks, but despite getting interviews, I’ve been ghosted every time—five times across local stores. I had previously reported serious issues (a problematic shift lead and an unsupportive manager) to ethics without staying anonymous, and I suspect that might have affected my chances. Desperate for work, I ended up getting hired on the spot by another coffee chain.",4,1741574640.0,starbucks,11,1.0,False

1j7op1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1j7op1r/i_cant_live_with_roommates_for_another_4_years/,I can't live with roommates for another 4 years,"I went to a boarding school. Somehow, I managed to pull a single room all 4 years. Man, I had no idea how I good I had it. By senior year, I had my own single bathroom as well, and I had built up this perfect routine. 

Woke up at 4:30-5, make bed, turn on the light and pocket radio sitting on my desk, morning stretch/cold shower, went for a long run around town/play piano, made myself breakfast (with a hot plate I had snuck in), watch a lecture video before leaving, and then head to the academic building across the street to get work done before class started. Greet the faculty walking their dogs & getting coffee. Do class. Between classes I'd do homework, retreat back to my dorm, work out, eat, or go play piano again. 

After classes were athletics. I did mountain biking, skiing, tennis, and rock climbing, usually somewhere off campus.

Dinner was either a formal dinner, or I'd make something in the dorm again. The dining hall stuff wasn't nutritious or reliable.

I'd watch a show and work out, usually in my underwear. I kept the temp around 76° usually (I have a combination of hypothyroidism, Raynaud's and I'm also female, so anything under that temp leads to freezing extremities). Cold showers are only ok because they're temporary, and I warm up quickly when the air itself is warm. Super neat and clean room as well.

Anyway. 

After that I'd sit in the common room with the faculty member on duty for the night, chat next to the fireplace with some lemonade and almonds or something, and do a homework assignment. Shower again (warm), stretch, meditate, and then go to bed at 8:30ish.

Groceries on Friday evenings. Weekends were social or for hikes in the region. 

TLDR: 

I had space to be my weird self, and space to be healthy.

So with all of that out of the way, right now I have a roommate. Never spoken to him and he's never spoken to me. There's one window in the room, the thermostat is at a constant 65°F with no way to change it.

Bathrooms don't have any air circulation and no windows, but it could be worse. At least I was placed in a dorm and not homeless.

I'm taking 17 credits of the hardest major at the school, a job, and ROTC as well. So that contributes to the problem as well. 

My sleep schedule follows his schedule, because he stays up with the light on until 1, which is the complete opposite of what I had before. Sometimes he sleeps until the afternoon. Then I wake up at 5 for ROTC three times a week, and can't turn the light on or do anything loud as to not wake him up. His side of the room is super disorganized, but that's not my problem. Although I think he might be depressed. 

As soon as he comes in, I feel like I need to monitor myself constantly. It's just anxiety, but it's driving me nuts. I don't think most of this would be happening if I had a single again. 

""Did that sneeze sound normal?""

""I need to bring my clothes with me to shower to change""

""I have no time to study""

""If I meditate or stretch in here he'll think I'm weird as hell""

""I have to put in headphones to watch everything""

""Please, please wash your hair for your own sake""

""My hands are too slow to type this out because they're fucking numb, purple, and cold""

""I feel depressed because he's depressed""

""Please open the shades and let some sunlight in here for once, dude""

My guard is always up. It's exhausting. I can't do any of the healthy things I was doing anymore. I have lost skill in both of my hobbies. I'm tired and freezing cold all the time. Can't focus while doing assignments. No good sleep. Body feels like shit. When I hear the doorknob open, I feel a surge of panic go through my body. Why??

He's living exactly how I was freshman year of high school. He's clearly still living a teen life. Listens to tik tok or anime or something until the wee hours.

Why can't I just live an adult life and not have to regress back to how I was 5 years ago for the sake of cohesion? 

Pisses me the fuck off. All of the things that made me feel good I cannot participate in any more. I have no routine. No time to let my guard down and no chances to ever fully relax. They're all small things, but those small things made a huge difference in my quality of life and productivity.

I'm just so frustrated. I understand that I had a privileged high school experience and that there's a big contrast, but it's still impossible because my roommate and I are just so different in so many ways. Any perspective is welcome and hopefully someone can relate.",8,1741574517.0,CollegeRant,15,0.79,False

It doesn’t have to be the best coffee I’ve ever tasted in my life either. I’ll probably end up with a basic blonde roast or something on the lighter end.

Downsides to the KF7? I saw some reviews about the temperature being super low?

1j7ol51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1j7ol51/noble_eightfold_path_on_daily_life/,Noble Eightfold Path on daily life,"How to apply it to a typical day, keeping it grounded and doable.

1. Right View (Samma Ditthi)
Definition: Seeing reality as it is—impermanent, interconnected, and without a fixed self—through the Four Noble Truths.Application to Daily Life: Approach your day with perspective: things change, suffering comes from clinging, and peace is possible. See challenges as temporary, not personal failures.
* Example: You spill coffee on your shirt before work and think, “My day’s ruined.” Right View: “This is annoying, but it’s just a moment—spills happen, and I’m not defined by this.”
* Practice: Start your morning reflecting: “Today’s full of change—I’ll meet it as it comes.” When stress hits, pause and ask, “What am I clinging to here?”

2. Right Thinking (Samma Sankappa)
Definition: Cultivating intentions of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness over greed, hatred, or ill will.Application: Set a positive tone for your day—let go of grudges, wish others well, and avoid harmful obsessions (e.g., envy). Direct your mind toward kindness and purpose.
* Example: You’re dreading a meeting with a grumpy coworker. Right Thinking: “I’ll let go of expecting them to be different and aim to stay patient—may we both get through this okay.”
* Practice: Before leaving home, silently intend: “May I act with care today.” When irritation flares, redirect to “I’ll choose peace over this.”

3. Right Speech (Samma Vaca)
Definition: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and constructively, avoiding lies, slander, harshness, or gossip.Application: Use words thoughtfully in daily interactions—at work, with family, even online. Speak to uplift or clarify, not to tear down or vent mindlessly.
* Example: Your friend texts something annoying. Instead of snapping, “You’re so clueless,” reply, “I see it differently—can we chat about it?”
* Practice: Before speaking (or posting), check: “Is this true? Kind? Needed?” At dinner, share a positive story instead of complaining.

4. Right Action (Samma Kammanta)
Definition: Acting ethically, avoiding harm to self or others through physical behavior.Application: Make choices that support well-being and integrity—keep commitments, care for your body, and avoid harm (e.g., procrastination, overindulgence).
* Example: You’re tempted to skip a workout and binge snacks. Right Action: “I’ll take a short walk instead—it’s kinder to my body than zoning out.”
* Practice: Tackle one small task (e.g., dishes) with intention. Help someone—a coworker, a stranger—with a simple act like holding a door.

5. Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva)
Definition: Living and working in a way that’s ethical and doesn’t harm self or others.Application: Align your daily work and habits with values that don’t drain you or hurt others. Balance effort with rest so your life supports your practice.
* Example: You’re overworked and cranky. Right Livelihood: “I’ll say no to an extra task today—I need energy for myself and my family.”
* Practice: At work, focus on tasks that feel meaningful. At home, cut one habit (e.g., doom-scrolling) that clashes with your peace.

6. Right Effort (Samma Vayama)
Definition: Persistently working to abandon unwholesome thoughts and cultivate wholesome ones.Application: Put steady effort into staying present and positive throughout the day. Catch negativity early and shift it toward gratitude or patience.
* Example: Traffic’s bad, and you’re fuming. Right Effort: “I’ll drop this anger—it’s not worth it. I’m glad I’ve got music to listen to.”
* Practice: Each hour, notice your mood. If it’s sour, think of one good thing (e.g., “I ate today”) to pivot your mind.

7. Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)
Definition: Staying present with body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, observing without clinging or aversion.Application: Bring awareness to daily routines—eating, walking, talking—instead of autopilot. Notice your state without judging it.
* Example: You’re rushing lunch, stressed. Right Mindfulness: “I feel my fork, taste this bite—my stomach’s full. I’m here, not just hurrying.”
* Practice: Pause three times a day—feel your breath, your feet on the ground. During conversations, really listen, not just nod.

8. Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)
Definition: Developing focused attention through meditation or discipline to calm and unify the mind.Application: Carve out moments to focus deeply—meditation, a task, or a quiet break—building mental clarity for daily challenges.
* Example: You’re scattered after emails. Right Concentration: Sit for 2 minutes, focus on “in, out” breaths, then tackle one thing at a time.
* Practice: Meditate briefly each morning (5 minutes, counting breaths). At work, single-task—e.g., write without checking your phone.

A Day with the Eightfold Path
Imagine a typical Tuesday:
* Morning (Right View): Wake up tired, thinking, “Ugh, another grind.” Reframe: “This day’s fresh—tough stuff passes.”
* Commute (Right Thinking): Car cuts you off. “I’ll let go of this—may they be safe.”
* Work (Right Speech): Colleague vents. Instead of “Suck it up,” say, “That sounds rough—want to brainstorm?”
* Lunch (Right Action): Tempted to overeat. “I’ll stop now—my body feels better light.”
* Afternoon (Right Livelihood): Boss piles on work. “I’ll finish this, then rest—I deserve balance.”
* Evening (Right Effort): Mind whines, “I did nothing today.” Shift: “I showed up—that’s enough.”
* Dinner (Right Mindfulness): Eating with family, notice, “Warm food, their voices—I’m here.”
* Night (Right Concentration): Before bed, focus on breathing for 5 minutes—calm settles in.

Outcome
Living the Eightfold Path daily isn’t about being a saint—it’s about small, mindful shifts. You’ll still spill coffee, snap occasionally, or zone out, but you’ll catch it sooner, respond wiser, and suffer less. Over time, your day feels less like a battle and more like a practice—imperfect, human, and alive.

She's usually so outgoing and such a people person, but the longer she hangs out in her apartment, the less she wants to go do stuff besides have brunch weekly. She's telling me she doesn't get dressed until after 12 or 1 PM, and that's not like her at all. I'm hoping to take her out once or twice a week with the goal of helping her find some friends and activities to leave the house for. She doesn't sew, crochet, or knit (unfortunately or I could bring her to some spaces I'm in), but I think she'd be a good sport about trying new things. She loves gardening, getting coffee and a pastry, and reading.  She's so funny and charismatic and genuinely my favorite person - she deserves the world. I really appreciate any ideas y'all may have!",2,1741573695.0,fargo,7,1.0,False

I'm wondering if anyone can give any advice on areas to live and what to expect with our rent budget. 

We love to walk/bike/be close to downtown in Boise, no matter the season, and want to have a similar situation in Missoula. Our ideal living space is a stand-alone house (we're used to sharing walls in an old converted house or having a basement/upstairs neighbors, totally fine) with two bedrooms or a bedroom and an office. Something that would be nice to have, but not necessarily a deal breaker is storage space for our outdoor gear and tools. Our ideal neighborhood is friendly, has coffee/grocery/parks/cute stuff a walk or bike ride away, and we are down with quirkiness. Suburbs look affordable but not really what we're looking for... is there any likelihood we can get some of these things for under $1700? Boise's rental market is crazy, and it seems Missoula is the same. 

In our research, it seems the west side is most desirable, but the posts I've seen saying that are a little old. I'm intrigued by the north side, and am wondering if Franklin to the fort has okay access to the heart of Missoula? Bikeable, maybe? 

We're visiting in late May with the hopes of finding something great. Any and all advice is appreciated! ",2,1741573586.0,missoula,10,0.57,False
1j7oed1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j7oed1/which_grindermachine_combination_would_you/,Which grinder+machine combination would you recommend? [200-360€],"Hey everyone,

I've been a barista for a few years now and have had the chance to work with some great commercial-grade espresso machines and grinders. However, when it comes to setting up a home espresso station, I feel a bit out of my depth. With so many options out there, I'm overwhelmed by the possibilities and would love some advice!

### Our Coffee Preferences
- I primarily drink espresso (light-medium roast) and the occasional flat white.
- My wife (also a barista) prefers lattes and mochas, using decaf medium-dark roasts.
- Mornings are busy with a baby and a toddler, so we need a setup that allows for quick and easy shots without excessive puck prep.

### Second-Hand Options I'm Considering
#### **Grinders:**
- **Fellow Opus** (€165)
- **GOAT Arco** (€300)

#### **Espresso Machines:**
- **Hibrew H10A** (€170)
- **DeLonghi ECP33.21** (€60)

### My Dilemma
I've always heard the advice to prioritize a good grinder over the machine, and I've used the Arco before for both espresso and filter. I really liked its precise adjustments. That said, I've heard great things about Fellow products, but I'm unsure how user-friendly the Opus is when switching between espresso and filter daily.

For the espresso machine, I’ve been considering Lance Hedrick's insights on portafilter size and puck depth, which could make the DeLonghi a more straightforward option for minimal puck prep. However, I also enjoy tinkering with settings, and I wonder if the Hibrew would offer more flexibility in that regard.

Since my wife primarily drinks milk-based drinks, steaming capability is a key factor. We both have solid steaming technique from work, so I’d be open to modding the DeLonghi's steam wand—if it delivers enough steam power.

### Possible Setups
- **Overkill Combo:** Arco + DeLonghi
- **Balanced Choice:** Hibrew + Opus

### Other Considerations
I currently own a Timemore C3 Pro, but I’ve only tested it for espresso once (paired with a Presidente GTI at work), and it was too coarse. Perhaps it would work better with a home machine?

Any advice, insights, or alternative suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!

And you’re in a pickle, 

Chary of the truth,

But wary of the lies.

No, this love interest was completely UNFORESEEN. No amount of METTTC, OACOK, or MDMP analysis could’ve prepared my little cadet self for the type of woman I was about to encounter at one of the most hellish places on earth. 

Day 3: I’m sitting in the CP doing very important pretend junior officer things ( I was the defacto Coffee Bitch for officers and all VIPs) and that’s when I saw her. A 5’4” dark haired Air Force tech sergeant (more like tech mommy). At least 15 years my senior. Our eyes lock, to my surprise, she approaches me and asks “where can I find your commander?”.  I blush and in my manly officer voice I advise her “stand fast sergeant he will back shortly” — my Professor of military science would’ve been so proud.  

She was clearly confused by the circle on my chest and asked what my rank was. I jokingly said “weellll you see I’m actually not really a person, but if you are going to pretend I exist, my rank is cadet”. She mentioned something about West Point which I thought was weird because not every cadet (especially those in the guard) go to a service academy…. I would’ve called her retarded but she was pretty and Air Force so I let it go.  

Fast forward a week and half: we’ve been working together for a while and the air force people were actually some of the nicest people to me.  They actually acknowledged my existence but not tech mommy. She would always pick on me… here are a couple examples (there are many more). 

1) I was trying to get the attention of a group of soldiers and raised my voice since they didn’t hear me and she said “sssssshhh you don’t need to yell, why are you being loud?”.

2) A group of NCOs came into the office and were shooting the shit and to fit in, I laughed. Her response was “wow that was really awkward. Are you autistic?” (Yes but she doesn’t need to know that).

3) “Hey since you’re not doing anything you should get me a cup of coffee” — I did so but not because I needed to listen to her. It was just a nice thing to do. 

After a few days of this naturally I was getting aggravated. “why does this beautiful enlisted woman think she can talk to me this way?” … “it’s honestly kind of hot … like I’m not against it”. 

**Then came Thursday** and I had enough! I door-dashed some Burger King because after 2 weeks of prison food I was starting to get suicidal. I’m chowing down, mouth closed, but I’m naturally a loud chewer. 

A SFC is sitting at one end of the table and she’s right next to me. Apparently she’s side eyeing me as I eat my burger and SFC goes “why are you mean mugging him?”. 

She goes onto say that I’m the loudest chewer in the world and that I should try not to chew so loudly. Furious but also a little wild 😝 up by her comment, I swallow fast. **I put my burger down and stand up, “if you ever tell me what to do again, if you ever even make fun of me again I WILL HAVE YOU BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES!!!! Well not right now but when I get my commission!!!! You do realize I outrank you sergeant? Don’t you?”**

She replied: “You know you’re really cute when you talk like that. Do you want to take your seat now”?

My heart skipped a beat. I felt things I haven’t felt since a 40 something year old tinder date let me call her mommy for the night. 

As I took my seat I came to the realization that I was in fact in love with this very rude airforce technical sergeant. She’s gone now… I wish I told her how I felt before she left. 

To this day I still don’t know what it was. She casted this spell on me. She emasculated me in every way.  She made me feel small…. She made me feel useless and I just surrendered to her power every day. 

**TLDR: I fell in love with an airforce technical sergeant that treated me like her boy toy, how do I find her? And is this considered fraternization—I don’t want my PMS to disenroll me**

1j7ocqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j7ocqe/my_23f_deceased_brothers_friend_25m_is_making_me/,My (23F) deceased brother’s friend (25M) is making me uncomfortable,"When I was 16F, my brother (who was 18) died in a car accident. It was brutal. He was my only sibling. He was popular. He had a girlfriend and a large group of friends, most of which were from the same group- they were tight knit.
My brother was a kind person, and had also manage to find friends in other walks of life, some of which he met in detention at school, some of which had no friends of their own- they were not apart of his “popular” group at school, so he hung out with them separately- for drinks, or lunch, or coffee- outside of school hours.

This year in November, it will be eight years since he passed. Recently, one of his “other”  friends has started to display some concerning behaviours.  
Although it has been eight years, those to have lost a sibling or a child know the pain that my family feels. Some days we get on okay. Other days it feels like at the moment we found out he was gone all over again. 
To sum up, this person 25M wasn’t close with my brother. He is a sweet boy who took classes with my brother, texted my brother, maybe even caught up with him once or twice. But I feel horrible in saying- he wasn’t “known” as a friend of his to my family or myself until after his passing. But for the past year, or so, he has sent me concerning messages. Messages on how he “sees my brother infront of him” and how he wants to see me in person for coffee or dinner to tell me the things my brother has told him in spirit. 
After my brother’s passing my family and I saw ladybirds as a symbol of him being around us. This person has now had a large ladybird tattooed on his arm. It sounds horrible without context, but he has been calling me and messaging me at all hours of the night, even at 2 am when my partner and I are sleep in our bed, asking if I have time for a phone call to talk about what my brother has been telling him. 
This makes me uncomfortable. But I must say I am not the kind of person to turn-away someone who I personally see, as in need of psychological help. It sounds wrong to say. I appreciate him thinking of my brother in this way- even going as far to get a tattoo in honour of him, but coming from someone who barely knew him, this is concerning. 
He has found my parents on Facebook- also messaging them asking to catch up for coffee or drink to “talk”.  Although my parents are adults and can make their own decisions, I feel protective- I don’t want them to sit down and listen to what I personally see as spiritual delusions. They are empathetic people, and I know this would upset them deeply, not due to my brother’s death, but due to a smart young man rambling on about his psychic abilities to see my brother talking to him. They care a lot for all people who knew him, who he loved- so to see one of them in this state would be confronting to them.
I am not a skeptic when it comes to the spiritual world, but if you knew all of the messages this person has sent me, you would see how I see it- he is not well, he does not sleep. He posts on social media about ladybirds and seeing my brother in them, constantly. He now has people who didn’t know my brother whatsoever sending him photos of ladybirds. He tells them *insert my brother’s name* is with them- people who didn’t know him whatsoever, he screenshots it and puts it on his story. He is making some kind of spiritual icon out of my brother and it makes me uncomfortable and upset.
I know, I need to tell him how I feel, how I feel his, turning my brother into some kind of martyr that he wasn’t, perhaps some of you will read this, and think that I should feel honoured or happy that someone is carrying on his legacy. But I am not comfortable with the fact that there are people out there, who didn’t know him who do not know us now see ladybirds and send them to this person and say that he’s with them when this person himself didn’t even know him well at all… A month ago, I found this person’s sister on Facebook and messaged her with my concerns for his mental health and obsession over my deceased brother. She was so empathetic and lovely and assured me that they were well aware of his situation as a family. I asked that my message to her remain anonymous as I would hate for him to think that I was “snitching” on him for something he clearly cannot help mentally- but the phone calls and messages have only persisted since.
I care for this boy, and I cannot help that- I care for him in the way I care for all the people who knew my beautiful brother. Due to my grief, I feel I cannot block him and I’ll wait to see his name on the news or in an article saying he took his life or something of the sort. But I cannot continue to play into this delusion, or tell him that we will catch up soon even though I truly do not want to, as I know what he will try to tell me will upset me. Any advice on what to tell him in a kind, caring way would be so appreciated.. i am at a loss currently. Is there anything I can do to put a stop to this and help him?
