By 2025, search engines will be smarter, users will be changing their behaviors, and AI tools will have never been more prevalent. If you are still using mediocre SEO tactics, you have fallen behind. The good news is that smart, ethical, and strategic SEO still works, and you can still see great results.¬†

In this blog, I will discuss 5 real-time SEO strategies that are proven to have better rankings, click-through rates, and quality leads than their traditional counterparts. These strategies will be informed by what works right now and include real examples from the digital world.

¬†**1. Search Intent Over Keywords**

Today, it is not only about what users search; it is equally important to understand why they searched for it.

¬†**Real Example:**

¬†When users search for ""best budget phone 2025"", they want comparisons, reviews, and suggestions, not a product page.¬† Often, brands that rank high in search results are sites like TechRadar and GSM Arena, which create useful comparison articles with real reviews and real price comparisons.

**How to apply this:**¬† Use Google's ""People Also Ask"" to help develop your content.

Know if the user is looking for information, does the user need to buy something, a tutorial, etc.¬†¬†

Make sure that your content fully satisfies the user's intent.¬†

**2. E-E-A-T** Show Experience and Authority. Google is now putting more weight on the E-E-A-T principle: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.¬† You need to prove that you are truly an expert, and not a content creator.

**Real Example:** ¬†When Healthline writes about medical issues, their articles get peer-reviewed by certified doctors, and that is why they have outranked other blog websites.¬†

**How to apply this:** Add author bios and avatars to your blogs.¬† Include true case examples, testimonials, and project results in your blogs.¬†

Include images or screenshots of the actual work performed.

**3. Using Voice & Visual Search.** With the growth of smart speakers and image-based search tools, SEO in 2025 is not just about text search.¬†



**Real Example:**¬†

Local cafes, including Third Wave Coffee, optimize their business profiles and use natural phrases such as ""best coffee near me"" and ""quiet caf√© to work in Coimbatore"". Their Google My Business listing is critical in addition to their FAQs to help them show up on voice searches.



**How to apply this:**

* Use conversational questions: ""How do I...?"", ""Where can I...?""¬†
* Add image alt-texts and structured data.¬†
* Create FAQs targeting voice queries.¬†



**4. Smart Internal Linking and Topic Clusters**¬†

Google likes content that is interconnected and structured. Don't create separate blogs; create blog clusters.

**Real Example:**¬†

HubSpot creates a core page titled ""Digital Marketing Guide"" and links subtopic blogs, ""Email marketing"", ""Content SEO"", and ""Social Media Tips"" to that page.¬†

**How to apply this:**

* Choose a pillar topic (ex, Digital Marketing).
* Create supporting blogs (ex, SEO Tips, Social Media Strategies).
* Link all subtopics to the main page and vice versa.  

This boosts time on site and helps Google understand your website‚Äôs content structure.



# 5. Page Speed and Core Web Vitals Matter More Than Ever

Google‚Äôs algorithm now considers how smooth your website feels. Even a 1-second delay in loading can lower your ranking.

**Real Example:** E-commerce brands like Nykaa and Ajio have optimized their websites for mobile and desktop. Their product pages load quickly, which reduces bounce rate and improves ranking.

¬†**How to apply this:**

* Use tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix.  
* Compress images and use lazy loading.  
* Avoid heavy popups or clunky scripts.  



# ¬†Conclusion: Stay Updated or Get Left Behind SEO. 2025 SEO is not about shortcuts, it is about embracing change, identifying real user needs, and demonstrating your value. Everything working today across SEO is around clarity, speed, relevance, and trust.

## Key Features Analysis

The defining characteristics of a surfboard table contribute significantly to its overall appeal and functionality. From the materials used to the structural design, several factors influence the quality and suitability of the table for different environments.

**Material Quality:** The material used in crafting a surfboard table dictates its durability and aesthetic. High-end tables often utilize reclaimed wood, solid hardwood, or high-quality fiberglass. The type of finish applied, whether it's a natural stain, glossy resin, or matte varnish, also impacts its resistance to wear and tear.

The Importance of Choosing the Right Material Cannot Be Overstated. For Outdoor Tables,Weather-Resistant Materials Like Teak or Marine-Grade Plywood are Essential. Indoor Tables Offer More Flexibility, Allowing for the Use of MDF, Pine, or Even Recycled Plastic.

**Tabletop Dimensions and Shape:** Surfboard tables come in various sizes and shapes, emulating the diverse designs of actual surfboards.Length, width, and curvature affect both the visual impact and practical usability of the table. Shorter,wider tables may serve as coffee tables,while longer,narrower tables are better suited as console or side tables.Carefully Consider How You Intend to use the Table. A Table Intended for Serving Food and Drinks Should Have a Sufficiently Large and Flat Surface. For Decorative Purposes, a More Sculptural and Unconventional Shape Might Be Preferred.

**Leg Design and Stability:** The legs of a surfboard table are critical for its stability and visual balance. Common options include metal hairpin legs, wooden trestle legs, or even custom-designed bases that mimic ocean waves. The choice of leg style should complement the tabletop and ensure the table remains sturdy, even when bearing weight.

Ensure That the Legs are Properly Attached and Constructed Using Durable Materials.Consider the Floor Surface Where the Table Will be Placed. Uneven Floors May Require Adjustable Feet on the Legs to Maintain Stability.

**Finish and Detailing:** The finish and detailing of a surfboard table, such as painted designs, epoxy resin inlays, or hand-carved elements, add to its unique character. These embellishments can range from subtle accents to bold, eye-catching statements, reflecting the personal style of the creator and the preferences of the buyer.

Pay Attention to the Quality of the Finish. A Poorly Applied Finish can Result in chipping, Fading, or Yellowing Over Time. Opt for Tables with UV-Resistant Finishes to Prevent Sun Damage and Maintain Their appearance.

**Environmental Sustainability:** With increasing awareness of environmental issues, many surfboard table manufacturers are prioritizing sustainability. Using reclaimed materials, eco-friendly finishes, and ethical production practices reduces the environmental footprint of these products.Support Companies That are Committed to Sustainable Manufacturing Practices. Look for Certifications Such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) for Wood Products or GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) for Fabric Accents.

WARNING: LOST POST AHEAD.

For months, I'm not in a good shape with my father(55). It started when I lost my job early this year and it happened that I am currently staying here in our house in province with him and his live in partner. 

I am staying in the city for years and I only needed to go back here because he got sick and had his back surgery - an open wound, back in October. I am the only one looking after him because his so called live in partner can't go absent from her care taking job. While I was a probationary employee at that time, I needed to go on absent and took care of him instead that put my job at risk. 

He's been hospitalized several times after his surgery because of being hard headed. He does everything that's been prohibited by his doctors that causes him to get sick more often. 1 pack of cigarette a day, drinking coffee 5-7 times a day, all the restricted food, etc. 

Sobrang galit na galit ako kase napakaselfish nya. My partner and I helped him since the day he was brought to the hospital and we were the one who looked after him afterwards. Yet when we lost our jobs because we chose to take care of him, biglang pinapalayas na kami dito sa bahay dahil malas at perwisyo daw kami. We work at night, so intindi mo dapat na tulog sa umaga. While my partner works at home part time, I do travel 4hrs going to work and 4hours going back home every single fucking day. 

When my partner wasn't here yet, I only sleep for like 2-3hrs everyday. My shift starts at 1am and ends at 10am. Since I am from province kailangan ko agahan ang alis kase wala ng masasakyan pag alanganing oras. 

I usually leave the house for work at 8pm then I'll arrive at work around 12mn. Pag uwi naman dahil madalas traffic makakarating ako sa bahay around 1-2pm. Pagdating ko lilinisan ko pa sugat ng tatay ko, magluluto ako ng food nya for lunch, maghuhugas ng mga tinambak nyang hugasin from last night and breakfast that day saka palang ako matutulog. usually nakakatulog ako around 4pm-5pm na. then kailangan ko gumising ng 6pm kase ipagluluto ko pa sya ng dinner. Good thing tinulungan ako ng kapatid ng tatay ko na pag tanghali hahatidan nalang sya ng pagkain para makakapahinga pa din ako somehow pagdating ko. 

Bruh, that's my setup for 3 weeks back in November since he got discharged from the hospital after surgery.  then come last week of November naospital ulit dahil sa acute gastritis. Kape pa. Yes, partner ko ulit nagdala sa kanya sa ER that second time around because I was already travelling to work and yeah I had to go back ulit to take care of other stuff for him while my partner looks after him at the hospital. Fucking hell. 

January hindi nako nakapasok dahil sa sobrang bleeding and hindi ako nawawalan ng lagnat. Again, I was a probationary employee. Pinalad makapasok sa magandang company pero nasayang yung chance because of what happened. Pero at some point masasabi ko at least hindi ko sya pinabayaan. Kase ang nasa isip ko non makakahanap pa naman ako ng ibang work, pero hindi ko mababawi yung mawawalang oras if pababayaan ko lang tatay ko. 

During those times, nagsstay na dito ang partner ko since inaalalayan nya ko pag aalaga sa tatat ko dahil once a week lang umuuwi yung babae nya. 

My partner and I cover everything for them. Hanggang sa natanggal na nga ako sa work and ang partner ko. Napaka timing ano? HAHA. 

That's when our kalbaryo started. February,  we had a heated argument. HINDI KO ALAM ANG RASON BAKIT GALIT NA GALIT SYA SAMIN THAT MORNING. I was sick so I got up late mga around 8am. Same as my partner kase he took care of me that whole night. We bought ulam na and was about to cook for him when suddenly nawalan ng gas (which was fully okay pa nung nagpainit ako ng water and alam kong marami pa yong laman.) My father locked the tank, tinago yung electric stove. Pinatayan kami ng water and all those shitty things. Bruh I'm telling you I was furious, so I asked him bakit nya tinago? Alam nyo sabi? malakas daw sa kuryente at wala syang ipambabayad sabi ko we never asked you for bills payment. Ano ba problema mo?? He bursted in anger and said ""MGA PUTANGINANYO MAGSILAYAS NA KAYO DITO MGA HAYOP KAYONG DALAWA PERWISYO KAYO! MGA MALAS KAYO DITO. MGA TANGHALI KAYO MAGISING PUTANGINA NYO!"" I was taken aback and said ay wow?? Di mo ba naiintindihan na panggabi yung naging trabaho namin and it's been a week palang and di pa nakakaadjust yung body clock? Napaka unreasonable mo naman. Dahil lang wala nakong mabigay sayo na masarap na pagkain? Haha. Ikaw? Maaga ka nagigising 6am. magkakape ka, tapos hihilata ka na buong araw. Swerte ba yon?? Lahat ng gawain dito samin ikaw kakain ka lang. Napakasama ng ugali mo! KUNG hindi naman dahil sayo wala kami ngayon dito! Hindi kami malulubog sa utang kung hindi namain piniling ipagamot at unahin ka! Napaka ungrateful mong tao! Dahil wala ka ng pakinabang ganyan mo na kami itrato! After that  2 weeks kaming hindi nagusap. Sariwa pa sugat nya ha, ayaw nya ipalinis. Pabayaan nalang daw syang mamatay. We still cook food for him, pero hinahayaan nya lang masira or langgamin so I stopped being soft. Tiniis ko sya. Since sakto paubos na yung gasa nya. For the very first time sinabihan ko na yung live in partner nya na bumili ng gasa. That's also the time when his live in partner told me na she's tired of his attitude and selfishness, pinagbabawalan syang makita mga apo at anak nya and even paggastusan sila. na baka di na nya kayanin at iwan na din nya. 

March, Isang umaga hindi pa ko nakakapamili and yung tatay ko ayaw kumain ng pritong itlog as ulam. He chose na uminom ng kape kahit bawal sa kanya kase daw gutom na sya. I explained to him na bawal pa kase naggagamot pa sya. Btw that was the third time he got hospitalized and my partner brought him again to ER. 

So ayon na nga, hanggang sa sinasabihan nya ko na tatanda ka rin tanginamoka. When all I was saying was mas okay na kumain sya ng kanin na itlog ang ulam kesa magkape sya eh bawal sa kanya. Ang pinipilit nya is ayaw nya ng itlog gusto nya ng masarap na ulam. I was trying to explain na wala pa kaming nadidiskarte na pera and itlog lang ang available na food. So napasabi ako out of frustration na bakit pag yung asawa nya itlog ang binibiling ulam kinakain nya pag ako ang bumili ng itlog ayaw nya.

Nagkasagutan na kami, bakit daw pag tanghali nagigising partner ko di ko pinagsasabihan. That's what he knows, pero pinagsasabihan ko to. And besides kami ng partner ko ang gumagawa ng lahat dito sa bahay. yung tatay ko tagakain lang. Pero pag pauwi babae nya ng Friday evening, hapon palang nagreready na yan sya magsaing para sa kanilang dalawa. 

sabi ko baket? yang kinakasama mo ano ba kako natulong nyan saken? sa pagpapagamot sayo? hindi nga makakaagaw ng buhay ng mamatay yan e! pag nagkakasakit ka sinong nag-aasikaso sayo? sinong nagdadala sayo sa ospital?? ikaw na iniingatan ikaw pa ganyan ugali? napakabullshit! so ayon lahat ng mura na pwede nyong marinig sinabi nya sakin. pumasok ako sa kwarto at nagwala talaga ko, kaya ang ginawa nya binasag nya mga pinggan ng mom ko. (wala nakong nanay NASA heaven na) pinagbabato nya yung pinto ng kwarto ko ng kung ano ano lahat basag.  and even told us na pagtatatagain nya kami at papatayin. 

galit na galit ako to my core. binantaan nya kaming pag hindi kami umalis papatayin nya kami. and for those na magsasabing why not move out? we don't have the means yet. nasakripisyo na namin lahat ng meron kami when he got sick. nalubog sa utang, nawalan ng sari-sariling apartment sa city. wala na kaming ibang pupuntahan dahil yung natatago namin noong funds ay nagastos para maipagamot ang tatay ko. We didn't expect na mawawalan kami pareho ng work all of a sudden. so ayon. 

Nagsumbong ako sa barangay a day after nya kaming pagbantaan dahil panay hasa sya ng itak nya and tinititigan kami ng sobrang sama na kala mo pinapatay na kami sa utak nya habang hinahasa ang itak. Only to be told by one of the councilors na wag na ituloy kase nakakahiya sa nayon. Kamag-anak sila ng tatay ko. I showed them proof. and recordings ng pagbabanta at verbal abuse. But still, sinabi nila na tanungin ko daw ang tito ko what to do. I just told them na okay wag na ituloy ang blotter but please at least record na I nagpunta ako to report na ganon sitwasyon sa bahay and whatever happens to us, I reported it immediately. 
We weren't able to report sa police dahil wala talaga kaming pera pamasahe that time. 

2 days after nalaman yon ng tatay ko and was even more furious. Lahat ng pagmumura lahat ng masasakit na salita sinabi nya. I have a recording din. Na he was just giving us a week to move out pag hindi, gagawan nya kami ng hindi maganda. Imagine the threat and takot na nararamdaman ko non since ganon na ganon nya kami pagbantaan noong bata pa ako. 7 years old ata ako non or 6 when i first witnessed him na hinahasa ang mga itak at sasabihin sa mama ko na yun ang ipangpapatay nya saming lahat ng mga kuya at mama ko pag hindi kami umalis sa bahay na to. Pinag-aawayan ata nila non ng mom ko is because hindi pumayag mom ko makipagsex sa kanya. My mom is our sole provider even since. Once in a blue moon lang makapagtrabaho ang tatay ko, not to exaggerate pero maybe 1-2x a year ganon. He's a plumber. .

Palaging ganon, nung elementary ako I remember grade 3, 5 and 6 ako when we needed to leave kase pinapalayas nya kami and pinagbabantaan ng papatayin. with his matatalas at bagong hasang itak. When my mom refused to, magiinom yon buong araw uuwi syang lasing ng madaling araw tapos iwawasiwas sa amin ang kutsilyo nya and balisong tapos dilat na dilat at nagngangalit ang ngipin. takot na takot ako non everytime uuwi syang ganon ang itsura. 

lahat ng yan nagflashback nung last na away namin back in March. Sinabi pa nya na wala daw akong kwentang anak dahil ang kapal ng mukha kong maghabla. Ipaalam ko pa raw sa buong nayon na wala akong kwentanat suwail ako. Lahat daw ng taong galit makakapagsalita ng ganoon so sabi ko kung mabuti kang magulang hinding hindi mo pagbabantaan na patayin ang anak mo. natahimik sya then proceeded to curse at me again. 

3 weeks kaming hindi naguusap non pero hindi pa din kami nakaalis dito hanggang ngayon dahil nga wala pa kami parehong trabaho, sobrang dami na naming naaapplyan pero hindi ko alam bakit ang hirap matanggap sa trabaho ngayon. 

I landed a job offer last month, salamat kay Lord but the proposed date is not until next month. Background check is ongoing and I am really hoping na makapasa ako. Mahigpit sila sobra. Hindi ko pa maasikaso yung medical ko dahil wala talaga akong pamasahe papunta sa accredited clinic ng company. Hindi ko na alam. May part time ako pero delayed ang sahod. hindi ko na alam.. 


Ngayon, it's been 2 weeks since hindi kami nagkikibuan ng tatay ko. ewan ko laging mainit ulo nya sakin, okay kami 2 weeks ago tapos biglang isang umaga galit na naman sakin  tanginang yan haha. dati umiiyak ako e kase I don't know anong ginawa ko pero this time I am just mirrorring what he's doing. I match his energy. Ayaw mo ko kausap ayoko din sayo


mind you na Monday-Friday morning kami ang bumibili ng food para sa aming 3 dito sa bahay. We never let him starve as much as possible. gumagawa kami ng paraan para makakain kami at least twice a day dahil pinagkakasya lang namin ang nadidiskarte namin na pera. Friday night dumadating babae nya dun lang sya kikilos  sobrang sigla non. pero pag kami lang dito sa bahay, himatlugin. lahat masakit. pero nakakagala yon haha. Hindi sya imbalido. Batugan lang talaga since birth. 

So ayon, nababalot na din ako ng poot at ayoko nito. gusto ko lang makaalis na dito at ayoko na syang makita kahit kailan. Napatanong lang rin ako if tatay ko ba talaga sya? bakit ganon nya ko itrato haha.
kanina, nadulas ako sa kitchen and accidentally napadampi kamay ko sa likod nya and the looks in his eyes punong puno ng galit at pandidiri. kulang nalang sampalin ako sa galit dahil nadampian ko sya. 

Ayoko na dito. Hindi ko alam anong ginawa ko sa Diyos bakit nya ko nilagay sa sitwasyon na to. palagi akong nananalangin at nagtitiwala na he has his great plans pero hanggang ngayon, nakakulong ako sa impyernong bahay na to. hindi ko na alam anong gagawin ko. 

So ayon, AKO BA YUNG GAGO KUNG HINDI KO NA ATA KAYANG PATAWARIN ANG TATAY KO AT PARANG HABAMBUHAY NAKONG PUNO NG POOT?",2,1749535813.0,AkoBaYungGago,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a German citizen, he is Japanese, and recently he started meeting a Taiwanese woman regularly ‚Äî they go out to eat, play golf, and spend hours together, even though he calls it just ‚ÄúGerman language exchange‚Äù. Since she doesn‚Äôt speak Japanese, they have to communicate in German, which adds another layer to the situation. This is at least the fourth or fifth time they ºve met in a short period of time. He even took her photo on his phone.

He says he respects me and pointed out that he washed a pair of shoes I had (which he had bought me for my birthday last year), implying he‚Äôs considerate, but at the same time, he openly told me he‚Äôs meeting another woman and even ate bread my mother brought for me without hesitation.

Yesterday, we argued because I was upset about his behavior. He said he doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm jealous or angry, especially since I also have some contact with other men ‚Äî but in my case, I mostly talk to them in group calls with other people (both women and men), and rarely meet anyone in person. When I do meet someone, it‚Äôs only once for coffee as part of a language exchange, and nothing continues afterward.

I confronted him about how quickly he‚Äôs moving on after just a few months, but he denies having feelings for this new woman yet.

What‚Äôs confusing me is that I don‚Äôt love him anymore, but his actions still irritate and hurt me deeply. He also accuses me of disrespect, even though I feel he‚Äôs the one crossing boundaries. I feel like he projects his own emotional immaturity onto me.

We still live together, which makes the situation even harder. I‚Äôve deleted all our shared photos and told him to do the same.

I want to stop caring about what he does, but it‚Äôs difficult. How should I best handle living with him now? And does his behavior seem emotionally immature to you? Any advice or perspective would be appreciated.",1,1749535809.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

>

Chapter 1  
  
The day I found out I was pregnant, I walked in on my husband having sex with his adopted sister on our couch.  
  
When I confronted them, I started hemorrhaging badly‚Äîblood pouring down my legs. But Sebastian just scooped Vivian into his arms and stormed out, shouting:  
  
""Don't be so damn judgmental! Vivian was born without a vagina‚Äîit's a birth defect. As her brother, I just want her to experience intimacy before her reconstructive surgery!""  
  
""If you can't handle this, we'll divorce tomorrow. Once Vivian's surgery is over, we can remarry!""  
  
They rushed me to the ER as I bled everywhere. During my six-hour emergency surgery to save the baby, my phone kept buzzing. Vivian was sending me explicit videos, one after another.  
  
Our bedroom, his car, his office... her mouth on him, his hands all over her body, grinding against each other in every way possible...  
  
I realized they'd been doing everything except actual penetration this entire time‚Äîoral sex, mutual touching, dry humping like teenagers who couldn't go all the way.  
  
That night, I calmly signed the divorce papers and left the Walker family behind.  
  
Three years later, while volunteering at a rural Maine orphanage, I ran into my ex-husband.  
  
He wore that same arrogant smirk.  
  
""I'm New York's richest man now. Still think you made the right call walking out over something so trivial? I'm giving you one shot to come back.""  
  
What he didn't know was that I'd remarried‚Äîand my two-year-old was napping upstairs.  
  
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  
  
""Julia, this is pretty pathetic, don't you think?""  
  
""Radio silence for three years, then you magically show up in this dump right after I hit the Forbes list? Don't tell me this is some coincidence.""  
  
""Cut the act! I'm here on important business. Until you properly apologize to Vivian for what you did, I'm not taking you back!""  
  
Sebastian froze mid-step as he climbed out of his Maybach, spotting me outside the community housing. After a beat, he let out a mocking laugh.  
  
Vivian gracefully followed, her hand‚Äîadorned with a massive Graff wedding ring‚Äîcasually sliding around Sebastian's arm.  
  
They looked like the perfect power couple.  
  
Even after three years, seeing them together like this still messed with my head.  
  
Back then, when Sebastian's father brought home a girl with a birth defect to be his adopted sister, teenage Sebastian completely lost it, pinching his nose and yelling:  
  
""Get her out of here! I don't want some freak as my sister! That's disgusting!""  
  
Watching Vivian huddle in the corner, trembling, I smacked Sebastian upside the head and took her cold hand in mine. I led her to the bathroom, wiped away her tears, and got her into soft pajamas.  
  
That's how Vivian became part of the Walker family.  
  
Her condition made her incredibly insecure and timid. Kids at school constantly bullied and mocked her.  
  
So I held her hand and taught her makeup, helped her pick out her first dress, stayed up all night helping her with homework.  
  
Watching Vivian grow more confident and radiant each day, getting closer to Sebastian‚ÄîI thought I was doing something beautiful. I never imagined the two people I loved most would end up stabbing me in the back.  
  
When I didn't respond, Sebastian's eyes swept over the run-down housing behind me, his expression full of pity.  
  
""You regret leaving me, right? Look at yourself‚Äîyou can't even afford decent rent. The dogs Vivian and I have live better than this.""  
  
""Think about it‚Äîyour parents are dead. Besides me, your childhood sweetheart, who else do you have left?""  
  
Sebastian seemed to soften slightly, sighing.  
  
""Look, Vivian's feeling carsick. Stick around for a few days and take care of her. If she forgives you, you can come home.""  
  
""But remember‚Äîno more of that crazy jealous crap from three years ago. Vivian and I are innocent. Your paranoia just makes things uncomfortable for everyone.""  
  
Vivian immediately started stomping her feet, grabbing Sebastian's arm and whining like a child.  
  
""Babe! I'm never forgiving her!""  
  
""She ghosted us for three years‚Äîdidn't even show up when you were in the hospital. Now that you're loaded, suddenly she appears!""  
  
Sebastian laughed and leaned down to kiss her lips softly.  
  
""Relax, baby. I'm just screwing with her. Why are you getting all worked up?""  
  
""You forgot we're getting married soon anyway.""  
  
That instantly cheered Vivian up, though she kept shooting me dirty looks.  
  
I took a deep breath and stepped back.  
  
""You've got this all wrong. I'm here volunteering.""  
  
I'd been coming to this small Maine town for a year now, ever since I met Principal Charlotte and promised to help out annually.  
  
Mr. Lewis, the sweet old teacher coordinating everything, nervously tried to back me up.  
  
""Yeah, yeah, Mr. Walker, you got it wrong about Ms. Grace. She's this botanist our principal brought in special. I was just giving her a ride since I was coming this way...""  
  
Sebastian snorted, his face turning cold.  
  
""Oh, cut the crap! Nice little performance! Maybe work on not stuttering through your lines next time?""  
  
""Julia, I was being generous here! If this is how you're gonna play it, then just screw off and stop wasting my time!""  
  
""Come on, Viv! Standing here another second is beneath us!""  
  
His engine roared as they peeled out, kicking up dust that had me and Mr. Lewis coughing our lungs out.  
  
Even with my usual patience, I was ready to tell them both where they could shove it.  
  
My phone buzzed‚Äîa text from my husband.  
  
\[\*Hey babe, you make it to town okay? Don't skip breakfast.\*\]  
  
Followed by some ridiculous cat cuddle GIF that was so unlike his usual serious self‚ÄîGod knows where he finds this stuff.  
  
I couldn't help grinning, my mood instantly lifting as I typed back.  
  
\[\*Matthew, you're being cute again! Already ate. Heading into town now‚Äîmight lose signal.\*\]  
  
Mr. Lewis drove me in his beat-up van along crazy winding mountain roads for over three hours before we finally made it to the community center.  
  
He was leading me to the office to check in when I walked through the door and immediately wanted to turn around and leave.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The normally quiet office looked like some kind of smoky boardroom. Cigarette smoke everywhere, tables covered with coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays.  
  
Sebastian and Vivian were sitting there like king and queen, surrounded by a bunch of fancy-dressed businessmen kissing their asses.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're incredible! Youngest billionaire in New York, and now you've got connections with the old-money families‚Äîsky's the limit for you!""  
  
""My company's nothing compared to yours‚Äîwe're gonna need all the help we can get, Mr. Walker!""  
  
I coughed from all the smoke.  
  
Sebastian looked over at me with this ""I fucking knew it"" expression, holding up his hand to shut everyone up while staring at me like I was dirt.  
  
""Well, well. Julia, you really followed me all the way out here? That's even more desperate than I thought.""  
  
Everyone turned to stare at me.  
  
""Mr. Walker, who's this?""  
  
Sebastian's smirk got even nastier as he put on this fake sympathetic act.  
  
""Guys, meet my pathetic ex-wife. Now that I'm successful, she's stalking me like some psycho.""  
  
""Julia, since you begged your way out here, how about you start by getting everyone coffee? Maybe if you grovel enough, I'll throw you a bone.""  
  
All the businessmen immediately looked at me like I was trash.  
  
Someone looking to kiss Sebastian's ass immediately piped up.  
  
""Damn! Mr. Walker and his lady are relationship goals‚Äîeveryone knows he's crazy about her. You're not even good enough to shine his shoes!""  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're way too nice! This bitch probably got used up and tossed aside, and now she's back 'cause you're loaded. Watch yourself!""  
  
Another guy shoved his cup forward aggressively:  
  
""Yo, waitress! Where's my water? How you gonna win back Mr. Walker with shitty service like that?""  
  
As the insults got worse, Vivian was cracking up like it was the best entertainment ever. She casually flicked her perfectly manicured nail, sending her water glass crashing to the floor.  
  
""Whoopsie! My bad, Julia sweetie! Clumsy me! You're such a doll‚Äîyou'll clean this mess up and grab me a fresh glass, won't you?""  
  
Everyone erupted in laughter while Sebastian sat there with that cruel smirk, watching me like I was dirt.  
  
I chuckled softly and grabbed the water pitcher.  
  
I was about to drench the whole damn table when Mr. Lewis went bright red and frantically blocked me.  
  
""Ms. Grace, no! Please, let me‚Äî""  
  
""Folks, Ms. Grace here is VIP‚Äîour principal flew her in special from New York...""  
  
Sebastian slammed his foot into the table, his voice ice-cold.  
  
""Cut the shit! Same fucking story on repeat‚Äîwe get it!""  
  
""She's my pathetic ex-wife! She screwed me over, so when I say jump, she asks how high! End of discussion!""  
  
One businessman made a show of standing up.  
  
""Well, if this is your idea of hospitality, you can kiss that funding goodbye...""  
  
Mr. Lewis completely lost it, running around trying to stop people from leaving, practically in tears.  
  
""Wait, please! You can't go‚Äîour principal's in the ICU and she trusted me to take care of you...""  
  
""She's gonna kill me if you all walk out...""  
  
I set down the pitcher, took a deep breath, and smiled at Mr. Lewis.  
  
""It's fine. They're our guests‚ÄîI got this.""  
  
Watching me pour water for everyone, Sebastian finally looked pleased, giving me an approving nod.  
  
""There we go, Julia. Much better.""  
  
I ignored him completely, just kept their glasses filled.  
  
The conversation shifted back to business deals, Sebastian throwing in comments here and there while keeping his predatory gaze locked on me.  
  
What nobody saw was Vivian under the table, her fingers clawed together in rage, eyes burning with pure hatred.  
  
That afternoon, Mr. Lewis took me around to meet the kids.  
  
They were all hiding behind doorways, peeking out at me shyly.  
  
I pulled out the candy I'd brought and suddenly they were all over me like excited puppies, chattering non-stop.  
  
This sweet little girl named Lily Shaw picked some wildflowers and bashfully handed them over.  
  
""Ms. Grace, are you gonna be our teacher? You're so pretty‚Äîlike a princess in the movies!""  
  
I grinned and scooped Lily up, taking her flowers.  
  
I had no clue that one innocent moment was about to royally screw us both over.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Next morning, I was alone in my room working on lesson plans.  
  
CRASH!  
  
Someone kicked my door clean off its hinges.  
  
Sebastian barged in, dragging little Lily by the arm, with teary-eyed Vivian and those angry businessmen right behind him.  
  
Sebastian looked absolutely murderous as he grabbed my wrist, examining it closely.  
  
The second he spotted my emerald bracelet, his eyes went black with fury.  
  
""Julia! Are you out of your goddamn mind? You're so hell-bent on screwing over Vivian that you got a kid to steal for you?!""  
  
I was totally lost, yanking my wrist away from Sebastian's death grip.  
  
""What are you even talking about?""  
  
Vivian stepped up, laser-focused on my emerald bracelet with tears pouring down her cheeks.  
  
""I'm not wrong. That bracelet‚Äîmy mom walked barefoot for three days to reach the Vatican. She prayed for hours on those stone steps until her knees bled, just to get this blessed by the Pope himself before she died. I'd know it anywhere.""  
  
""Julia, why'd you steal the only thing I have left of her?""  
  
""Is this... is this payback for asking you to serve coffee yesterday?""  
  
""I swear I didn't mean it like that‚ÄîI was just testing to see if you really loved Sebastian...""  
  
Vivian completely broke down while everyone looked at me like I was absolute trash.  
  
""Jesus, stealing from a dead woman‚Äîthat's low even for you.""  
  
""Poor kid was just being nice and this psycho pulls this shit.""  
  
Sebastian looked at me like I made him sick.  
  
""Julia, I actually thought you'd grown up. When you served everyone yesterday, I figured maybe you were finally ready to fix things between us. Turns out you were planning this twisted crap the whole time!""  
  
""God, I almost felt bad for you!""  
  
Little Lily was trembling, staring up at me with scared eyes.  
  
""Ms. Grace... I found a purse and gave it back to the lady, but she says stuff's missing...""  
  
Everything suddenly made perfect sense.  
  
I pulled Lily behind me and laughed bitterly.  
  
""Vivian, you should've researched before trying to set me up. This bracelet was personally blessed by Pope Francis for my husband's family‚Äîit's literally one of a kind. Like you could ever have connections like that.""  
  
Vivian's pupils dilated‚Äîshe obviously had no clue this simple-looking bracelet had such prestigious origins.  
  
But everyone just burst out laughing at my words.  
  
""This crazy bitch is making up stories now.""  
  
""Stop it!"" Sebastian's face twisted with disgust. ""Enough with the lies, Julia! When the hell did I ever get you papal jewelry?""  
  
""The Vatican doesn't just hand out blessings to nobodies like me. Quit making a fool of yourself! And one more thing...""  
  
He smirked, his voice dripping with contempt.  
  
""Don't call me your husband. We're divorced, remember?""  
  
I took a deep breath, ready to tell him exactly where he could shove it.  
  
""Sebastian, I'm already married to‚Äî""  
  
Suddenly Vivian hit the floor hard.  
  
Her whole body started seizing, foam bubbling from her mouth‚Äîit was horrifying.  
  
Sebastian went white, diving into Vivian's bag and pulling out an emergency inhaler, jamming it between her teeth like he'd done it a million times.  
  
A few seconds later, the convulsions stopped and Vivian curled up in Sebastian's arms like a broken bird, silently shaking.  
  
Everyone was freaked out by what just went down.  
  
When Sebastian looked at me again, his eyes were pure venom.  
  
""Julia! You know damn well that three years ago your drama gave Vivian PTSD seizures that she still hasn't gotten over...""  
  
Vivian weakly grabbed his shirt.  
  
""Babe, stop... I know Julia's not evil. She's just pissed about what happened before, pissed that I'm wearing your ring now.""  
  
""This bracelet is all I have left of my mom. If Julia gives it back, I'll get out of your lives forever...""  
  
Everyone was eating up this poor suffering angel act.  
  
They all started going off on her behalf.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you can't seriously consider taking back someone like her! Don't do that to your girl!""  
  
""Yeah, call the damn cops! Both of them need to learn a lesson!""  
  
Sebastian stared at me with pure hatred burning in his eyes.  
  
""Julia, since you won't own up to what you did, you and this kid can rot in jail together!""  
  
The door suddenly exploded open‚Äî  
  
""Over my dead body!""

In Leesburg, life moves at a beautiful pace. From scenic trails to comfortable cafes and community-focused living, it is the right place to slow down, breathe and focus on something many of us: [Total body wellness](https://mywellnessstudio.com/).

At My Wellness Studio, we believe wellness is not just about a one green smoothie or a few yoga poses, it's about a complete relationship between your mind, body and soul. So how do you bring it all together in everyday life? Here is how to make the total wellness part of your lifestyle, right here in Leesburg.

# 1. Start With Your Mind: Clear Out Mental Clutter

Let's face it, mental wellness sets the tone for everything else. It is difficult to feel when your thoughts constantly resonate with dos, e -post and worries.

* **Try This:** Start your morning with 5 minutes of peace. This could be breathwork, breathwork or simply sipping coffee without scrolling your phone.
* **Leesburg Tip:** Take a mindful walk through the W&OD Trail or Ida Lee Park. Nature is a natural stress relief.

At My Wellness Studio, we offer mindfulness and meditation workshops to help you create mental space for what matters most.

# 2. Move Your Body with Joy, Not Pressure

Exercise shouldn‚Äôt feel like a punishment. Whether it‚Äôs stretching, dancing, or strength training, the goal is to move your body in ways that feel good.

* **Try This:** If you‚Äôve been sedentary, aim for 20 minutes of movement a day. Walk your dog, try a short online class, or take a gentle yoga session.  
* **Leesburg Tip:** Explore local fitness trails or try a community yoga class.  

Our movement programs at My Wellness Studio focus on flexibility, strength, and low-impact cardio‚Äîperfect for all fitness levels.

# 3. Fuel Yourself With Purpose

What you eat directly impacts your energy, mood, and even sleep. But you don‚Äôt need a restrictive diet, just real, balanced nutrition.

* **Try This:** Build meals around whole foods: leafy greens, lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats. Don't skip meals, and hydrate!  
* **Leesburg Tip:** Visit the Leesburg Farmers Market for fresh, local produce to support your wellness goals and community.  

At My Wellness Studio, our wellness coaches provide easy-to-follow meal guidance to help you nourish, not restrict.

# 4. Feed Your Spirit‚ÄîEvery Day

Spiritual wellness is often the missing piece in many routines. It's not about religion‚Äîit's about feeling connected to yourself and your purpose.

* **Try This:** Light a candle, journal about what you‚Äôre grateful for, or create a ‚Äúno phone‚Äù evening routine.  
* **Leesburg Tip:** Attend a local wellness circle or explore healing modalities like Reiki or energy work.  

We offer spiritual wellness sessions and small group circles at My Wellness Studio designed to help you reconnect with your deeper self.

**5. Make Self-Care a Non-Negotiable**

You can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup. Whether it‚Äôs 10 minutes or a full afternoon, self-care should be as regular as your morning coffee.

* **Try This:** Block time in your calendar for something just for *you*: a facial, massage, bath, or nap.  
* **Leesburg Tip:** Support local wellness providers who offer massage, aromatherapy, or acupuncture.  

We offer self-care services like massage therapy, skin treatments, and guided relaxation all in one supportive space at My Wellness Studio.

Other apartment recommendations?,"I rushed into my current lease at Six on 6th because I was moving across country and needed to find a place under a short deadline. I couldn't tour so I wasn't clear on the neighborhood or the property management company (livlavender). I've had a slew of issues here from a roaches and mice infestation to my water being cut off for nearly 24 hours without notice, to dirty neighbors leaving literal car tires in the hallway and more. But the real issue is the dog situation. I'm basically saving my life by making this decision and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest.(context: I was attacked by a dog at my current complex which put me in the er earlier this year and have since been chased and cornered by several other unleashed aggressive dogs on property on multiple occasions and livlavender has done NOTHING about it despite my numerous pleas and complaints) I'm legitimately terrified I'm going to be mauled to death living here so I'm breaking my lease 5 months in and I need recommendations. 

Today I toured the Fleming building and was really impressed. I really, really liked it. If I moved there I'd be renting a 1br 1bath and it's in my price range but on the upper end of my price range with parking garage and quoted utilities. Unfortunately, the small studio option is out of the question because I have a large breed dog who is my ESA animal (pet rent and deposit don't apply to him) and I need the extra space for an at home office as I work remote. The studio would just be too cramped.

I REALLY love living downtown (I'm not now but have done so in the past) so I'd like to live there if possible. I'm not a night life person but having things close by (coffee shops, grocery shopping etc) and within walking distance is really important to me.

Any info you can provide about the Fleming building is helpful. Due to my current situation I'm feeling cautious and I really don't want to lock in to a place unless I'm sure it's safe. Also if you don't mind sharing, the person who gave me the tour said all utilities are included but I know a lot of places say that and then say that electric isn't but he didn't specify, if you could clarify that along with your average utilities per month I'd appreciate it. I've seen comments about the homeless and that doesn't really bother me much, but I'd like your opinions on that building and possibly other recommendations you might have for other properties either downtown or in West Des Moines closer to Jordan creek or the West Des Moines library as that is my other preferred neighborhood if I can't find something reasonable downtown. 

Also it would be nice to live somewhere a little more updated with a lot of natural light if possible. In unit washer and dryer and dishwasher is a major plus.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern spring water dispenser is more than just a simple water cooler. It integrates advanced technology and thoughtful design elements to provide optimal performance and convenience.**Filtration system:** This is arguably the moast crucial component of a spring water dispenser.The effectiveness of the filtration system determines the purity and taste of the water. High-quality dispensers typically employ multi-stage filtration systems, incorporating sediment filters, activated carbon filters, and sometimes even UV sterilization. These systems work synergistically to remove impurities like chlorine, lead, bacteria, and other contaminants, ensuring that the water you drink is clean and refreshing. The best systems clearly display the filtration stages and filter replacement schedules, making maintenance straightforward.

**Cooling and Heating Capabilities:** Many spring water dispensers offer both cooling and heating functions.

Precise temperature control allows you to enjoy chilled water for a refreshing drink or hot water for tea, coffee, or instant soups. Advanced models utilize thermoelectric or compressor-based cooling systems to rapidly chill water to the desired temperature.Heating elements with multiple temperature settings provide versatility for various beverage needs. Some units even include features like a ""keep warm"" function to maintain hot water at a consistent temperature for extended periods.

**Water Source and Bottle Compatibility:** Understanding how the dispenser sources and handles water bottles is essential.

Spring water dispensers are designed to work with either bottled water or direct connection to a water line. Bottle-based dispensers typically accommodate standard 3 or 5-gallon water bottles, while others use smaller, refillable containers. Direct-plumbed dispensers connect directly to your existing water supply, eliminating the need for bottle replacements and providing a continuous source of filtered spring water. Bottle-less options generally have built-in reverse osmosis systems which are great, but require additional maintenance.

**User Interface and Controls:** The user interface plays a vital role in the overall user experience.

Intuitive controls and clear displays make it easy to operate the dispenser and access its various functions.Touchscreen interfaces with customizable settings,such as temperature preferences and dispensing volumes,are becoming increasingly common. Some dispensers also incorporate safety features like child locks to prevent accidental dispensing of hot water. Digital displays that show water temperature, filter status, and other relevant information enhance the user experience.

**Design and Aesthetics:** A spring water dispenser isn't just functional; it's also a part of your home or office d√©cor.

Manufacturers are increasingly focusing on creating aesthetically pleasing designs that blend seamlessly with various interior styles. Sleek lines, stainless steel finishes, and compact footprints are common features. Some dispensers even come with customizable panels or lighting options to match your existing d√©cor.The dimensions and weight of the dispenser are also important considerations, especially if space is limited.Key features Include:

*   Efficient Multi-Stage Filtration
*   Hot & Cold Water Options
*   User-Friendly Controls
*   Sleek and Modern Design

## FAQs Section

Frequently asked questions provide clarity and address common concerns about spring water dispensers.**How ofen do I need to replace the filters in a spring water dispenser?**

The frequency of filter replacement depends on the type of filter and the volume of water dispensed. Generally, sediment filters should be replaced every 6 months, while activated carbon filters may last for 6-12 months. some dispensers have built-in indicators that alert you when it's time to replace the filters. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific recommendations.

**Can I use tap water in a bottle-less spring water dispenser?**

The dispenser's filtration system will purify the tap water, removing impurities and contaminants. Ensure your local tap water is safe for drinking before using it in a bottle-less dispenser. The dispenser will provide superior water to bottled tap water.

**Are spring water dispensers energy efficient?**

The energy efficiency of a spring water dispenser varies depending on the model and features. Dispensers with energy-saving modes and insulated tanks consume less energy.

The Moore residence stood silent beneath a starless sky. The last of the guests had melted into the darkness, leaving only the clinging scent of champagne behind‚Äîa fleeting testament to the union between the Moores and the Shaws.

Upstairs in the master bedroom, Lorraine Shaw lay sprawled across the silk sheets, her vision blurred with drink. She reached for the man standing beside the bed, her fingers curling into his warmth.

""Honey..."" The word slipped out, honeyed and hopeful.

The dim light carved shadows along his tall frame as he leaned over her. His scent‚Äîwarm, woody, undeniably masculine‚Äîwrapped around her before his body followed.

His weight pinned her, all heat and hunger and something darker. His mouth swallowed her gasp as his hands explored her body, lighting fires wherever they touched. Soon, she was lost to the rhythm of their shared pleasure.

\*\*\*\*\*

When morning came, Lorraine awoke aching and spent. Sunbeams danced across the rumpled sheets, gilding her smooth skin.

She stared at the sparkling chandelier above, memories flooding back. Last night was her wedding night, the night she'd gone to bed a girl and woken up a woman. At twenty years old, she'd never imagined anything could feel like this.

The next thing she felt was warmth‚Äîa strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her close. Still half-asleep, she smiled and turned toward what she thought was her husband, ready to greet him with a kiss.

But instead of her husband's face, her eyes first focused on a bare chest illuminated by dawn's golden light.

Heat radiated from him as her eyes traced his features‚Äîthe sharp jawline, those distractingly perfect lips. When her gaze reached his face at last, she took in the sharp arch of his brows and the elegant hollows beneath his closed eyelids.

For a second, she wondered if she was imagining things. But when she blinked, he was still there‚Äîreal, solid, completely wrong. Then, a scream tore from her throat before she could stop it.

Lorraine yanked the sheets up to her chin, scrambling back until she fell off the bed. ""Eugene?!""

This was unmistakably her bedroom, her own bed. Yet to her horror, the man in bed with her wasn't Stephen Moore, her supposed husband, but his uncle, Eugene Moore.

Lorraine couldn't believe her eyes. She struggled to piece together the events of last night, but her memory kept slipping away. The more she chased after it, the more it eluded her, leaving her frustrated and uneasy.

Eugene stirred, then sat up in one fluid motion. In seconds, he looked completely composed. His gaze landed on Lorraine‚Äîstill on the floor, her hair a mess, her clothes rumpled. ""Still in pain?"" he asked, his voice even.

His words made Lorraine glance up at the rumpled sheets‚Äîa stark reminder of last night. Her pulse jumped, and for a moment, the room seemed to spin.

She tried to push herself up, but her legs gave way. She was a split second from cracking her head on the bedframe when Eugene's arm snapped out, catching her just in time.

His scent‚Äîwoodsmoke layered with something deeper‚Äîwrapped around her, sparking another surge of panic in her chest.

Her voice shook as she looked up at him. ""What are you doing in our room?""

Eugene rose with deliberate ease, his body as perfect as carved marble.

Lorraine's eyes dropped for just an instant before she forced them away, her face burning. She turned aside, but her voice cut through the space between them. ""Answer me!""

""You enjoyed yourself well enough last night,"" he said evenly. ""No point pretending now.""

The words hit like a physical blow. Memories surged‚Äîthe heat of his body, the way she'd arched against him.

She had moaned her husband's name in the darkness, never imagining the body pressing against hers belonged to his uncle.

Her vision blurred with tears, her voice quivering with rage. ""If you don't give me a proper explanation,"" she threatened, ""I swear I'll report you for assault.""

# Chapter 2 Not When He Is Eugene

Eugene watched as Lorraine's angry words hung in the air. His face remained impassive, giving nothing away. With a slight nod, he said simply, ""Go ahead."" Then he turned and strode into the bathroom.

Lorraine sat frozen, struggling to steady her breathing. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, fingers twisting the bedsheet into tight knots.

Eugene was the Moore family's heir‚Äîtwenty-eight years old and already the CEO of Moore Group. His reputation spoke for itself‚Äîruthless in strategy, unshakable in resolve. He ruled the business world with calculated unpredictability, always staying just out of reach.

Lorraine had only met him once before the wedding.

A month ago, Stephen had brought her to meet his family‚Äîjust as Eugene returned from abroad.

While everyone else laughed and chatted around the table, he sat silent. Then his eyes‚Äîcold, sharp‚Äîlocked onto hers and held there.

That gaze had crawled under her skin. But when she looked again, she realized with a jolt he was staring right through her.

Now, trembling in the aftermath, Lorraine couldn't understand how their second meeting had gone so wrong.

She pushed herself up from the floor, trembling with fury as she pulled her dress back on. The moment it was in place, she stormed out of the bedroom, shouting as she went, ""Stephen!"" Her voice rang through the empty hallway.

All she cared about now was finding Stephen. Her legs trembled, weak and shaky, but she pushed on.

She flung open every door in the villa‚Äîupstairs, downstairs‚Äîbut only found staff who shrank back, silent and watchful.

Lorraine's composure shattered. She grabbed her phone and stabbed at Stephen's number. The call connected, only to be met with the cold, automated rejection of an unavailable line.

A cold dread settled in Lorraine's chest. This house was meant to be the home she shared with Stephen‚ÄîEugene's presence here made no sense. And without Stephen present, the familiar rooms felt strangely alien.

The butler, Daryl, silently appeared at her side. ""Ms. Shaw, breakfast is‚Äî"" he started.

""Daryl!"" Lorraine interrupted him, grabbing his arm like a lifeline. ""Where's Stephen? That man in our room wasn't him. It was‚Äî""

""Shall I have your breakfast served here or in the dining room, Ms. Shaw?"" Daryl's voice remained perfectly even as he deliberately used her maiden name, deftly sidestepping her question.

""Ms. Shaw?"" Lorraine repeated. ""Why are you calling me that?"" She was supposed to be Mrs. Moore now. That was the whole point.

Her fingers went slack. The phone slipped from her grasp, landing on her foot with a painful thud that shocked her back to the present.

Daryl retrieved the device with seamless efficiency. ""Were you attempting to make a call? I'd be happy to assist.""

Lorraine's voice cracked with desperation. ""I'm calling the police. I'll report Eugene for assault! Help me dial‚Äî""

""Of course,"" Daryl answered smoothly, his pleasant smile never faltering. He tapped in the numbers with ease and presented the phone to her like a waiter serving fine wine. His impeccable courtesy only made him more terrifying.

A cold realization washed over her. Eugene's casual ""Go ahead"" suddenly made perfect sense. The police wouldn't help, not when he was Eugene.

The hopelessness crushed her. Tears blurred her vision as she pushed Daryl's hand away and fled to her room. With Eugene still in the shower, she snatched her purse and bolted from the house.

# Chapter 3 The Lost Wedding Joy

Lorraine slumped into the taxi seat, her eyes still puffy from crying. She swallowed hard, afraid that if she opened her mouth, she'd start sobbing.

The wedding joy she'd clung to had curdled into pure terror. She couldn't bring herself to think about last night. But just remembering Eugene's face and that intense, overpowering presence of his made her shiver uncontrollably.

It reeked of a setup, and she'd walked right into it. Helplessness clawed at her ribs, relentless.

When the taxi reached her destination, she paid in silence, stepped out, and dialed Stephen again. His phone was still off, and even his parents didn't pick up.

She thought about calling someone else, but she didn't really know any of Stephen's friends. With nowhere else to go, she walked slowly into her family's house.

The Shaw residence lay quiet that morning. With Zackery Shaw, Lorraine's father, away from home, only her stepmother Raquel sat at the breakfast table, sipping coffee.

The moment she noticed Lorraine, her expression hardened. ""What are you doing here?"" she demanded.

Lorraine ignored the hostility and crossed the room. ""Raquel,"" she asked, her voice strained, ""is there any other way to contact Stephen?""

Raquel set down her cup with deliberate slowness, arching one perfectly shaped eyebrow. ""You don't have his number, and now you're coming to me?""

The familiar sting of Raquel's indifference barely registered anymore. Lorraine pressed her lips together. ""You were the one who fixed me up with him. Now I can't reach him at all. Do you know where he is? He's missing.""

At twenty years old, still a college junior, Lorraine had been pushed into this early marriage by her stepmother's scheming.

She'd been so desperate to escape that cold, loveless house that she'd agreed to marry Stephen after just a few months of dating. She'd hoped for better. But instead, she found herself more lost than ever.

Raquel dropped all pretense. A harsh laugh escaped her lips. ""He's missing? You can't even keep tabs on your own husband, and you're asking me? You're married now. Deal with it yourself. Stop dragging me into your messes. I'm not your mother.""

""Raquel, please,"" Lorraine begged, wringing her hands. Her voice trembled as she continued, ""I've looked everywhere. Just help me this once.""

With a sneer, Raquel rose from her seat. ""I've got shopping to do. Don't waste my time.""

She snatched her purse off the table and deliberately shoved past Lorraine. ""Get out. This isn't your home anymore. Stop coming back here like some lost puppy.""

Still weak from the previous night, Lorraine staggered back from the impact. The edge of the table dug into her lower back, sending a jolt of pain through her body.

Doubled over, she could only watch helplessly as Raquel flounced out the door with a triumphant smirk plastered across her face.

\*\*\*\*\*

As dusk settled over the city, Lorraine wandered aimlessly through the streets.

Her reflection in shop windows revealed her disheveled state‚Äîstill in last night's white cocktail dress, feet stuffed into the Moore family's slippers, her hair a storm-tossed wreck.

Her body ached with the intimate weariness of last night‚Äîa night that should have been shared with her husband. But Stephen, the man who should have been by her side, had vanished without a trace.

His phone rang endlessly to voicemail, and the Moore family's staff claimed no knowledge of his whereabouts.

Even his parents had switched off their phones, leaving the Moore residence deserted.

She'd spent the entire day combing through every possible location, unable to comprehend that not a single soul could explain what had happened. The indifferent flow of traffic and pedestrians around her only emphasized her isolation.

In under twenty-four hours, her world had inverted‚Äîfrom the heights of joy to the depths of despair, without warning or reason.

The phone buzzed persistently in her pocket before she finally noticed. When she pulled it out, an unknown caller ID stared back at her. Her breath hitched as she answered urgently, ""Stephen?!""

# Chapter 4 Like An Abandoned Puppy

The line went quiet. The faint static only made the silence feel heavier. Then after a long pause, Eugene's voice came through, deep and steady. ""It's me.""

A chill shot down Lorraine's spine, locking her muscles rigid. Her grip tightened on the phone, her palms growing damp.

""Where are you?"" he asked.

""I'm at..."" Lorraine's thoughts scattered as she glanced around.

An icy wind sliced through her, jolting her back to her senses. 'What was I thinking? Why tell him anything at all?' she thought, frustrated.

She closed her eyes briefly and stood perfectly still, refusing to answer.

Eugene waited. When no reply came, the line went dead.

The dial tone pulsed in her ear, making her nerves worse. She stood in the middle of the shopping district, snow falling heavily around her. Her breath formed pale clouds in the freezing air. If she didn't move soon, she'd freeze right along with the scenery.

\*\*\*\*\*

The staff of Silverlake Villa, Eugene's private estate, stood clustered by the entrance, bowing in practiced unison. ""Safe travels, sir,"" they chimed together.

Eugene emerged with his entourage, his imposing frame accentuated by the dark gray matte suit that draped perfectly across his broad shoulders.

His hair, swept back with precision, complemented the effortless authority in his every movement. His gaze alone carried enough weight to make subordinates hold their breath.

He slid into the Bentley's rear seat, his sharp eyes already locked onto his assistant, Isaac Lambert. ""Find her exact location within five minutes,"" he commanded.

\*\*\*\*\*

Lorraine couldn't face returning to the Shaw residence. The Moore residence was equally impossible. With no alternatives, she drifted into a nearby shopping center to escape the biting cold.

The year-end crowds filled the mall with cheerful noise and holiday spirit. It only made Lorraine's disheveled appearance and hollow expression seem all the more out of place.

She hadn't eaten since yesterday, and her empty stomach was growling.

The drafty mall entrance offered no refuge, the icy wind cutting through her thin clothes. The sideways glances from passing shoppers made her feel even more miserable.

Finally, she retreated to the emergency stairwell, hugging her knees to her chest for warmth. But the cold concrete walls seemed to suck the heat right out of her. Her body felt numb, though that was nothing compared to the hollow ache in her chest.

\*\*\*\*\*

In the parked Bentley, Eugene's knuckles whitened as he gripped the iPad.

The security footage showed her stumbling into the mall, then later huddled in the stairwell, arms wrapped around her stomach. The grainy image captured her perfectly‚Äîtrembling like an abandoned puppy, weak with hunger and cold.

The car's silence became oppressive. Isaac wiped his damp palms on his trousers before suggesting tentatively, ""Mr. Moore, perhaps we could arrange for Ms. Shaw to... find somewhere warmer? Maybe get her some proper clothes?""

The huge mall was owned by the Moore family. For Eugene, even burning the whole place down to keep Lorraine warm would have been nothing more than a trivial decision.

Yet Eugene's order was anything but expected. ""Have the mall close immediately,"" Eugene said, his voice devoid of emotion as he glanced at Isaac.

""At once, Mr. Moore,"" Isaac responded, already reaching for his phone as he exited the Bentley.

Closing early would mean a steep drop in revenue‚Äîyet no one dared to defy Eugene's orders.

*Reading time \~20 min.*

Think about skipping your morning routine. No brushing your teeth, no washing your face, no clean clothes. Feels weird, doesn't it? It's no different in your digital environment. Without basic ‚Äúdigital hygiene‚Äù, you leave cracks open for viruses, [hackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSiege/comments/1l24ghu/deep_dive_002_beyond_good_evil_the_many_colors_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and data leaks to sneak in.

In this article, you will learn the most important habits that every IT professional should know. Not only to protect yourself, but also your friends, colleagues and clients. These aren't optional extras, but essential skills that you need to pass on.

For everyone else: If you follow these steps, it will be much harder for black hats to break into your devices and steal your data.

Lots of people think, ‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù Well, try telling that to the 1.7 billion people who became victims of cybercrime in 2023 alone‚Ä¶¬†

Over the next ten sections, we‚Äôll build a simple, practical routine (like washing your hands or brushing your teeth), that keeps your devices, data and networks clean and safe. These habits aren‚Äôt flashy, but they‚Äôre the foundation of solid cybersecurity. Ready to start your day the right way?

# üîê Password security && login

Imagine brushing only once a week. You‚Äôd quickly end up with cavities, right? In the digital world, a strong password is your morning and evening brush. Quick, but it prevents decay.

So what‚Äôs a *strong* password? Let‚Äôs take it up a notch.Forget ‚ÄúP@55w0rd!‚Äù or real words like ‚ÄúFootball2024‚Äù.

Instead, use **phonetic passwords**, made of alternating consonants and vowels. They don‚Äôt form real words, but they‚Äôre still pronounceable and easier to remember than random gibberish. Add **two digits and a special character** at the end to complete the formula.

‚úÖ Example: `Olobabino45&` or `Zikobabe31=`

These are hard to guess, hard to crack and yet much easier to say and remember than something like `X4m!92#Dq`.

**Why does this work?**

* They‚Äôre not in any dictionary (protects against brute force & dictionary attacks)
* You can say them aloud (helps with memory)
* Numbers & symbols add complexity (fulfill security rules)



**Usage of the same passwords**

Can you imagine brushing your teeth with a toothbrush that is also used by your roommate, your neighbor and ... your dog? ü§¢ Using the *same* secure password everywhere is exactly like that. ‚Üí If one site gets hacked, all accounts fall.

Instead, let a **password manager** (e.g., Bitwarden, KeePass) handle your unique passwords. You only have to remember one strong master password, your **personal** electric toothbrush.

üí° *Tip:* Use a phonetic password for your master password too: `Nukemato88+` or Ribakeno27\*

**Add two-factor authentication (2FA)** for extra protection. Use an app like **Authy** or **Google Authenticator**, not SMS. Think of this as flossing: one small extra step that drastically improves your security hygiene.

As a rule of thumb, you can remember the following points, which work wonderfully for pretty much every platform:¬†

* **Strong & Unusual:** 12 characters, 1 capital letter, 2 digits, 1 special character
* **Don't reuse passwords** unless you want to suffer from a **credential stuffing** attack
* **Use a password manager** to use even more secure passwords



**Don‚Äôt become a target of credential stuffing**

A **credential stuffing attack** happens when cybercriminals use stolen username and password combinations (usually from data breaches) to try and break into many different accounts.¬†

Since many people reuse the same login details across multiple sites, attackers automate the process of trying these combinations on websites and apps, hoping to find accounts where people haven't changed their passwords. It's like trying a key on a bunch of doors to see if any of them unlock.

# üßæ Data minimalism

When you wash your hands, you aren‚Äôt scrubbing off your fingerprints. You only remove the dirt.

The same should apply to your personal data. Don't reveal too much. Only share what is really necessary - and no more.



**üß† Only what‚Äôs necessary**

Ever filled out a form and thought, ‚ÄúWhy do they need my birth date just for a newsletter?‚Äù That‚Äôs your inner warning system. **And you should listen to it!**

Before entering any information, pause and ask:**Do they really need this to offer their service?**If the answer is no, leave the field blank or use another provider if possible.

A delivery service needs your address. A news site? Probably not.A contact form might ask for your phone number. But do they really need it or is it optional?And why the hack does a new social media platform need my account details?

Being selective keeps your digital footprint smaller (and safer).



**üéÅ Don‚Äôt give away your data in shady giveaways**

Sometimes I think the name ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù comes from the fact that you give away your personal information, not that you get a gift...

You‚Äôve probably seen those contests:‚ÄúWin the new iPhone! Just tell us your full name, birthday and mother‚Äôs maiden name!‚Äù

That‚Äôs not a giveaway, that‚Äôs data harvesting.These details often match the answers to your security questions, making it easier for attackers to impersonate you.

Watch out for unusual requests for data that isn‚Äôt required for a giveaway. If they strike you as odd, it's best to pass up the multimedia package with the latest iPhone, a TV and the yacht. There are no winners there‚Ä¶

And worst of all, it doesn't even have to happen online! Sometimes you receive a small card on which you enter your details in order to ‚Äúget the chance‚Äù to win the prize.

# ‚úÖ Signs of a legitimate giveaway

* Hosted by a well-known or verifiable company (with legal info/imprint)
* Clear and transparent terms and conditions
* Only basic info required (name and contact, not sensitive data)
* No purchase or subscription necessary to enter
* Realistic prizes and clear odds of winning
* You stay on an official, trustworthy website

**‚ùå Red flags for a scam giveaway**

* No clear organizer or missing legal info
* Requests for sensitive data (birthdate, address, mother‚Äôs maiden name)
* Over-the-top prizes (e.g. iPhone + TV + Yacht)
* Poor language, spelling mistakes or low-quality design
* Claims like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already won!‚Äù
* Redirects to shady or unrelated websites

In addition, I don't see any major problems with smaller organizers on Instagram, TikTok or other social media platforms if:

* **Transparent rules are shared**: There‚Äôs a clear explanation of how to enter, win and when the prize is drawn.
* **No sensitive data or payment is required upfront**: Basic personal info (like name or address) should **only be collected after winning**, not before.
* **The giveaway stays on-platform**: You‚Äôre not sent to sketchy websites or asked to download anything.
* **The post feels authentic and consistent**: The influencer‚Äôs feed, language and interactions with followers seem genuine and not spammy.



**üìß Use burner emails for one-off signups**

Need to register just once, to download a PDF or test a tool? Don‚Äôt hand over your real email address.

Use disposable email services like:

* [mail.tm](https://mail.tm)
* [10minutemail.com](https://10minutemail.com)
* [muellmail.com](http://muellmail.com)

It‚Äôs like wearing gloves for a messy job: when you‚Äôre done, toss them away and your inbox stays clean.

Just be careful, because some platforms know the top level domains of the disposable addresses. They are often blocked by the registration process. But not always üòâ



**‚öôÔ∏è Check your privacy settings regularly**

Google, Apple and Meta all have privacy dashboards where you can control what they collect and how it‚Äôs used. It‚Äôs worth checking these every few months, like a seasonal cleaning routine.

Look for options like:

* Location history
* Ad personalization
* Device sync across accounts



**Ten minutes, once a quarter, can make a real difference.**

Data minimalism isn‚Äôt about being paranoid. It‚Äôs about being [mindful.You](http://mindful.You) wouldn't walk around handing out your house keys to strangers. So why hand out your birth date, phone number and browsing habits without thinking?

Keep what‚Äôs yours, yours.

# üë§ Protecting personal data

Your personal information is like your underwear: it‚Äôs important, it belongs to you. And it‚Äôs not meant to be shared publicly.



**üìµ Keep it off public feeds**

Think twice before you post your:

* Full birthdate
* Home address
* Vacation countdown
* Daily check-ins

Even harmless details can help someone piece together your security questions or figure out when your home is empty.

What seems like a fun update might become a **breadcrumb trail** for someone with bad intentions.



**üé≠ Spot social engineering**

Ever see posts like:‚ÄúYour rapper name is your childhood best friend + your first pet!‚ÄùOr: ‚ÄúTell us your mother‚Äôs maiden name for a laugh!‚Äù

It feels like a game, but it‚Äôs often a trick, called **social engineering**.Attackers use these questions to reset your passwords or access your accounts.

And worst of all, it's often not even on the net! Have you ever met a stranger who showed an extraordinary amount of interest in you and asked you for personal information? Maybe it was a hacker trying to find out information about your passwords.¬†

**Tip:**If the question could also be used to verify your identity somewhere. **Don‚Äôt answer it publicly.**Think of it like someone asking to peek inside your underwear drawer. Nope.



**üßΩ Strip metadata before sharing photos**

Photos carry more than just images. They often include:

* **GPS coordinates** (where it was taken)
* **Device info** (brand, model, software, version)
* **Edit history** (when and how it was changed)

This hidden data is called **metadata** and it can give away more than you realize. Like your exact home address from a selfie.

Use built-in settings or free tools like[ ExifCleaner](https://exifcleaner.com) to scrub this info before posting.**If it‚Äôs not meant to be public, don‚Äôt post it. Especially not by accident.**

(Of course, it's quite different if you're a photographer. In this case, this metadata is important to prove that it was you who took the photo)



Privacy isn‚Äôt about being secretive. It‚Äôs about being smart.Treat your personal info with the same care you give your private life.What you choose to share should always be **your** choice. Not something stolen, guessed or exposed.

# üì± Device security

Just like quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the virus from spreading and protected healthy people, device security isolates your data from attackers and malware. Without blocking your daily use.

We all learned a lot about the importance of keeping safe during those times. Now, let‚Äôs apply that same mindset to protecting our digital lives and devices.



**üîí Lock screens are the first line**

Using a PIN, password or biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint) is like closing the door to your safe space. But weak codes like ‚Äú1234‚Äù or ‚Äúpassword‚Äù are like paper-thin barriers that anyone can bypass.

**For phones and tablets:**Set them to auto-lock after inactivity. Use biometrics or a strong passcode (6+ digits or a complex string).

**For laptops and desktops:**Always lock your screen when stepping away, even for a minute. On most systems, it takes one simple shortcut:

* **Windows**: `Win + L`
* **macOS**: `Control + Command + Q`
* **Linux (GNOME/KDE)**: Usually `Ctrl + Alt + L` (can vary by distro or DE)

In many companies, it‚Äôs mandatory to lock your computer whenever you leave your workspace. Failing to do so (after repeated warnings) can lead to disciplinary actions such as official reprimands, loss of certain access rights or in severe cases, termination of employment. This rule is in place to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

In my last company we had the so-called ‚ÄúDSGVO cake‚Äù (DSGVO = The German GDPR). Every time an employee didn‚Äôt lock their computer, other employees sent an email on their behalf to the entire company (approx. 40 employees) and informed them that he or she would be bringing a ‚ÄúDSGVO cake‚Äù tomorrow.¬†

This wasn‚Äôt an action that came from the bosses, but from our IT staff to teach the colleagues a little lesson. This allowed us to supervise each other. Everyone loved cake but no one wanted to bake one. That was the perfect motivation for us to lock the computers üòâ

**Pro Tip:** Like regularly saving your work with `Ctrl + S`, make locking your screen a reflex with `Win + L`



**üîê Full-Disk encryption = Scrambled for strangers**

Full-Disk Encryption (FDE) means all the data on your device is locked with a special code, so nobody can read it without your password or key.

**The good news:** Most modern devices already have encryption built in and you just need to turn it on.

* **Windows:** Use **BitLocker**, a built-in tool that encrypts your entire hard drive.
* **macOS (Apple):** It‚Äôs called **FileVault** and it protects all your Mac data.
* **Smartphones:** Most Android phones and iPhones come encrypted automatically once you set a lock screen (PIN, pattern or password).
* **Linux:** Tools like **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) provide encryption, often during installation.

**Important:** Without your password or PIN, anyone who steals your device will only see scrambled nonsense. Your data stays safe and private.



**üîÅ Updates: Focus on security patches, not every new feature**Updates fix the holes hackers use to get in. But not every update is the same.

Think of it like medicine:

* Take urgent treatments (security **patches** and **hotfixes**) right away. They stop infections fast.
* Wait a bit before trying new supplements (big updates, that bring new features). They can have side effects if you jump in too fast.

So, always install security patches immediately. For bigger updates, wait until they‚Äôre proven safe and stable.

**How to tell the difference?**Look at the version numbers:

* **Patch updates** usually change the last digit (or the last 2 digits), like 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4
* **Minor or major updates** change the middle or first digits, like 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.3.0 or 2.0.0

Set your system and apps to auto-install security fixes. But don‚Äôt rush every new release.

Skipping important patches? That‚Äôs like refusing your critical meds. Risky and unwise!

You can dive even deeper by reading the official [semver.org](http://semver.org) docs. But be aware that not all programmers use this pattern in the same way. Sometimes programmers apply their own version rules, which can lead to a lot of confusion.



‚ö†Ô∏è **Rooting or Jailbreaking // Freedom comes with responsibility**

Rooting (Android) or jailbreaking (iOS) gives you full control over your device:You can customize system files, remove preinstalled apps and install software outside of official app stores.

But this freedom comes at a cost:It disables key security features like sandboxing, verified boot and automatic updates, making your device more vulnerable to malware and other threats.

Think of it like poking holes in your protective mask to breathe easier. You've also made it easier for harmful particles to get in.

**Bottom line:** If you truly understand the risks and need the extra control, rooting or jailbreaking can unlock powerful possibilities.For most users, though, the risks outweigh the benefits. Choose wisely.

# üìÇ Files && Cloud

Backups and encryption are like flossing for your teeth. They protect the gaps that regular use (and basic security) miss.

**Why not only admins should be concerned about backups**

Imagine your device crashes or gets stolen. Without backups, your files could be gone for good. Backups save copies of your data so you can restore it if something goes wrong.

**Tips:**

* Use an external drive (USB hard drive) or a **secure cloud service**
* Set up automatic daily backups with tools like Windows **File History** or Mac **Time Machine** so you don‚Äôt have to remember it.

**What happens without backups?**

You risk losing photos, documents or work files forever. Accidents, malware or ransomware can wipe your data. No backup means no rescue.



**Encrypt sensitive files**

Think of unencrypted files in the cloud as postcards anyone can read. Sensitive info like client data or personal details must be encrypted to stay private.

**How?**

* Use tools like **VeraCrypt** to encrypt files or folders before uploading
* Check if your cloud provider offers built-in encryption and understand how it works

**Risks of no encryption**

Your data could be accessed by hackers, unauthorized coworkers or leaked iCloud settings are misconfigured.



**Secure sharing**

When sharing files, don‚Äôt just send open links. Protect them by:

* Setting expiration dates on links (e.g., 24 hours)
* Adding password protection
* Send passwords over secure channels. In this case, a phone call is more helpful than an email!

Services like **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** and **OneDrive** support these features, so only intended people get access. Alternatively you can use [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) to send passwords, which will be deleted after first opening or after a certain amount of time.¬†



**Backup drives aren‚Äôt immortal!**

External hard drives and USB sticks are great for backups. But they don‚Äôt last forever. Just like shoes or phone batteries, storage devices wear out over time, even if they‚Äôre just sitting in a drawer.

Here‚Äôs what you should know:

* **USB sticks**: Usually last **5‚Äì10 years**, but heavy use can shorten that.
* **External hard drives (HDDs)**: Around **3‚Äì5 years** on average. Moving parts make them vulnerable to drops and wear.
* **Solid-state drives (SSDs)**: More durable and faster, but still have a limit. Expect about **5‚Äì10 years**, depending on usage.

üìå **Tip**: If your drive is older than a few years, consider replacing it **before** it fails. Always keep at least **two copies** of **important** data on different storages.



**üéûÔ∏è Bonus fact**

Old-school wins! **Photo slides (dias)** stored in good conditions can last over **100 years**, making them one of the most durable storage formats ever.



**üî• Bonus: Your own ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù at home with Wireguard VPN üî•**

If you want to access your home network‚Äôs storage (like a NAS or SAN) safely over the internet, **WireGuard** is a great option. Many modern routers, including **Fritzbox**, support it.

**What is WireGuard?**WireGuard is a simple, fast and secure VPN protocol. It creates an encrypted tunnel between your device (laptop, phone) and your home network, so you can safely access files as if you were at home.

**Why use WireGuard?**

* Your connection is encrypted, preventing hackers from spying on your data
* You can reach your NAS or other devices remotely, without exposing them to the internet directly
* It‚Äôs lightweight and easy to configure compared to older VPN protocols

**How to set it up on a Fritzbox:**

1. Open your **Fritzbox interface** (usually at [fritz.box](http://fritz.box) with a common browser) and go to **Internet > Permit Access > VPN** to check if your Fritzbox supports WireGuard. If you see the option to create a WireGuard connection, you're good to go!¬†
2. Set up a **Fritzbox user account** with access to the storage ‚Üí **System > Fritz!Box Users** ‚Üí Create or edit a user and give them storage access rights. **Use a strong password!** üòâ
3. Install the WireGuard app on your laptop or phone.
4. In the Fritzbox interface, go to **Internet > Permit Access > VPN**. Click **‚ÄúAdd WireGuard Connection‚Äù**, choose **‚ÄúFor one device‚Äù** and select the user you created. Download the generated configuration as a file or use the QR code.
5. Open the WireGuard app and click **‚ÄúAdd Tunnel‚Äù**. Choose **‚ÄúImport from file‚Äù** or scan the **QR code** from the Fritzbox setup.
6. **Save it** and **activate the tunnel** and you‚Äôre good to go!

Here‚Äôs how to set up an **additional harddrive** on your Fritzbox:

1. **Plug in your USB drive (SSD, HDD or USB Stick)**. Make sure the drive is formatted as **FAT32** or **NTFS**. Both are supported.
2. Go to the **Fritzbox interface** ‚Üí **Home Network > USB Devices > Storage (NAS)** and enable the NAS functionality. Your Fritzbox now shares the drive over the network.
3. Set up a **Fritzbox user account** with access to the storage ‚Üí **System > Fritz!Box Users** ‚Üí Create or edit a user and give them storage access rights.
4. **Access your drive locally**On Windows, open File Explorer and enter: `\\fritz.nas`. On macOS, use **Finder ‚Üí Go ‚Üí Connect to Server ‚Üí** `smb://fritz.nas`
5. Once your WireGuard connection is active, you can reach the NAS drive remotely with WireGuard, as if you were at home.¬†

**Example:**You‚Äôre on a coffee shop Wi-Fi and need a file from your NAS at home. Instead of exposing your NAS to the internet (which is risky), you connect to your Fritzbox via WireGuard VPN. Now your traffic is encrypted and secure and you can browse or download your files just like you were at home.

# üì¨ Email && Phishing

Think of emails like public surfaces. Before you click any link or open an attachment, you need to ‚Äúsanitize‚Äù by checking carefully for threats.

üîç **Check the Links**Look out for strange or misspelled domains (like [`amaz0n.com`](http://amaz0n.com) instead of `amazon.com`). Also overused parameters (like `?p=hack&t=me`) can be a indicator for possible phishing links.¬†

**üë§ Check Fake Senders**The name in the ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù field can be faked. Always **hover over** the sender‚Äôs address and any links to reveal the real destination. In most email clients you can check the real sender address. Look out for an arrow next to the possible fake address.¬†

üì± **Links on Android or iPhone?**Tap and **hold the link**. A preview or full URL should appear. This lets you check where it really leads **before** you visit it.¬†

But be aware: **don‚Äôt just single tap**, as some email apps might open the link immediately without warning.

üö´ **When in doubt, don‚Äôt click.**Phishing emails are designed to trick you using urgent messages and familiar-looking addresses. Stay alert. It‚Äôs better to double-check than to fall for a scam.



**Attachments from Strangers? Don‚Äôt Open Them**

Attachments can hide malware like trojans or ransomware. Even if it says something harmless, like ‚Äúinvoice.pdf,‚Äù if you weren‚Äôt expecting it, don‚Äôt open it. Opening malware can let attackers take control of your computer, steal files or lock you out until you pay a ransom.

And these files can come in various shapes: Zip, Docx, Xlsx, pptx and many more!‚ö†Ô∏è Also be extra careful with files ending in `.exe`, `.bat`  or `.js`. These can **directly run malicious code**.



**Never send passwords or credentials via email**

Legitimate companies **never ask you to confirm your password** or send credentials by email. Phishing emails often include urgent requests to ‚Äúverify your account‚Äù with a link that takes you to a fake login page. If you‚Äôre unsure, don‚Äôt click the link. Instead, open a new browser window and type the website address yourself to log in safely.

It also doesn't hurt to call a company on the website if you are unsure. Every website has some sort of contact option for users. Ask if the request in the email is valid if you can't tell if it's a scam.

# üß∞ Apps && Software

Installing apps is like choosing what you eat. You want fresh, safe food, not something spoiled or risky. The same applies to software: be careful where it comes from and what it‚Äôs allowed to do.

**Only Install from trusted sources**

For mobile devices, use official stores like Google Play or Apple App Store. On Android, you might hear about APK files. These are app installation files you can download from outside the store.¬†

But be warned: Installing APKs from unknown sites is risky. They can contain malware or backdoors. Only install APKs if you really trust the source, like a developer‚Äôs official site.



**üîç Review permissions carefully**

Apps often ask for access to parts of your device (like camera, contacts or location). But some requests don‚Äôt make sense. For example, a simple calculator asking for microphone access? üö® Red flag.

Always check permissions and ask yourself:

* ‚ùå Are permissions excessive or unrelated? (Bad)
* ‚úÖ Does the app ask for permissions related to its main function? (Good)
* üîß Can you disable or fine-tune them later? (Better)

üì± On Android, use **App Permissions** in Settings. On iOS, check **Privacy & Security** to review and adjust anytime.

**ü§î But wait! Sometimes permissions come bundled**

It‚Äôs not always shady: Developers sometimes **can‚Äôt separate permissions**, especially on Android. A single request might grant access to multiple related features.

**Example:** An app that lets you take a photo **and send it to a friend** might need access to:

* üì∑ **Camera** (to take the photo)
* üé§ **Microphone** (for the camera functions)
* üìÅ **Storage** (to save it)
* üìá **Contacts** (to send it directly)

üëâ Even though it sounds like a lot, it might be necessary for the app to work as intended. What matters is whether the **function justifies** the access.



**Check the reviews of other users**In most cases you can rely on the reviews of the other users. If the rating of an app is astonishingly low, check the comments. Sometimes they just rage about the overly used ads the app is using. But sometimes the users report about malware or cryptojackers. This happens in the google store more often than the apple store, because the apple apps are verified manually by the apple employees.¬†



**Keep your device clean**Unused apps take up space and can be security risks. Hackers exploit outdated or forgotten software. Make it a habit to uninstall apps you haven‚Äôt used in months. Less clutter means fewer chances for attackers.



**Bonus: Watch out for Cryptojackers**A Cryptojacker is a sneaky type of malware that secretly uses your device‚Äôs CPU power to mine cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, but mostly ‚ÄúMonero‚Äù) without your permission. Imagine someone stealing your electricity and device performance to run their expensive machines.¬†

That‚Äôs what cryptojacking does with your device‚Äôs resources.

**How can you get it?**Often, cryptojackers come bundled with apps or software from untrusted sources, like that risky APK you installed without checking. Sometimes, just visiting a hacked website can infect your device.

**Signs you might have a Cryptojacker:**

* Your device suddenly gets very slow or hot, even when you‚Äôre not doing much.
* Battery drains faster than usual on laptops or phones.
* Fans run loudly on your computer for no clear reason.
* High CPU usage showing in your task manager or activity monitor, even if you‚Äôre idle.

**Why is this a problem?**Besides slowing your device down and draining power, cryptojacking can cause hardware damage over time. Plus, you‚Äôre unknowingly supporting cybercriminals while your device suffers.

**How to protect yourself:**

* Only install apps from trusted sources
* Keep your software and antivirus up to date
* Monitor your device‚Äôs performance regularly
* Use browser extensions or security tools that block cryptojacking scripts

# üåê Browser && Internet use

When you browse the internet, you‚Äôre basically meeting tons of strangers. You don‚Äôt want to share sensitive info with anyone sketchy or let them eavesdrop on your private conversations.¬†

Just like in real life, good hygiene helps protect you online. Let‚Äôs break down how to stay safe and private.



üîí **Always use HTTPS: Your secure handshake**

Check for the lock icon in your browser‚Äôs address bar.¬†

HTTPS means your connection is encrypted. This protects your data from prying eyes. Not only from *Man-in-the-Middle* attacks, where someone intercepts your traffic and steals info, but also from eavesdropping or data tampering on public Wi-Fi or insecure networks.¬†

Without HTTPS, your passwords, credit card numbers or messages could be stolen or altered, like shouting secrets in a crowded room.

Listen to your browser! It tells you if a website can be insecure, because it lacks a valid SSL-Certificate which is needed to have a valid HTTPS connection.



üö´ **Ad && Tracker blockers: Use with care**

Extensions like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger block annoying ads and trackers that follow you online. They help protect your privacy and reduce distractions.

**But beware:** Some ad blockers bring malware or *adware* that secretly runs in the background, slowing down your computer and eating up memory. You might only notice when you disable the blocker and suddenly your computer feels sluggish or bombarded by ads.

For example, one customer of mine used AdBlock Plus (once **very** popular), which blocked visible ads but didn‚Äôt stop adware silently chewing up resources. Disabling the blocker revealed the real problem. Showing that this ad blocker had installed adware itself.

The developer probably wanted the customer to reactivate the AdBlocker. Since so many ads are displayed after switching off, this would have been very likely. I was able to help him clean up the device with a full virus and adware scan. **Yes, a ton of malware was found!**

From this example, you can see that even frequently used programs can be a big problem!



üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Incognito mode isn‚Äôt a magic cloak**Incognito or private browsing only hides your history and cookies on your own device. It‚Äôs like wiping your hands clean after touching something, so the next user can‚Äôt see your prints.¬†

But websites you visit, your internet provider or your employer can still see your activity.¬†

For true privacy, tools like VPNs help mask your IP address and encrypt your traffic. But remember, VPNs don‚Äôt make you completely anonymous or safe from malware or phishing and even backtracking your activity is possible!

# üë™ Digital Behavior && Awareness

Cyber hygiene works in the same way as the spread of germs: your habits online affect others. One careless action can spread digital infections across an entire network.

**Think before you connect**

Using public Wi-Fi feels convenient, but it‚Äôs like sneezing in a crowded room without covering your mouth. Without protection, you‚Äôre exposing yourself and others.

Attackers often set up fake hotspots that mimic legit networks (""Free\_Airport\_WiFi"" isn‚Äôt always what it claims to be). Once you're connected, they can intercept unencrypted traffic: logins, emails, even credentials.

If you *must* connect, use a VPN. It doesn‚Äôt make you invisible or invincible, but it does encrypt your data. So even if someone listens in, they hear static noise instead of secrets.



**Awareness is contagious (in a good way)**

Security knowledge is worth sharing.

If you learn how to spot a phishing email or secure a router, tell your friends or your family. Many breaches start at home: an outdated password on your parents' cloud account, a default login on a smart TV or that one USB stick your little brother plugged into *everything*.

Sharing tips doesn‚Äôt make you a know-it-all. But it makes you a little firewall for your community.



**Stay curious! Threats evolve!**

Cybersecurity doesn‚Äôt sit still. New scams, vulnerabilities and malware variants show up constantly. Even if your tools are solid, your habits need to evolve too.

**A good practice:** Once a month, look up a term you‚Äôve heard but don‚Äôt fully understand, like ‚Äúransomware-as-a-service‚Äù or ‚Äúsocial engineering.‚Äù

The more you know, the less you‚Äôll fall for. CyberSiege cardgame can also help you with this as well.When you get to know the playing cards, you will also find important IT and cybersecurity terms that you can explore outside of the game. Use the CyberSiege cards as your personal lexicon!

 

 

 

# Keep it clean. Stay sharp.

These ten routines aren‚Äôt flashy. No firewalls bursting into flames. No cinematic hacks. Just quiet, consistent habits. Like brushing digital teeth or washing your hands. And while no one claps for a clean inbox or locked-down router, trust me: you‚Äôll be glad when nothing explodes.

Start now. Share what you‚Äôve learned. And remember:üîê **Secure habits == Secure systems**

These people watch you on cameras in your home, your car, everywhere. Food and water are contaminated. How, you ask? Slowly, over thime, the ""Green Group"" began to gain allegiance and a following. Small businesses were taken over, then larger corporations. Then institutions, such as teaching, medicine, and the justice system, including police. This means that the decision in court may be pre-determined. Perhaps, most alarming of all, is that the food and water supply is tainted. Stop drinking coffee people, because it is not what it seems. There are bugs in the coffee, and worm eggs in water. Or worse. Most of the food and water is slowly poisoning you, over time. More and more people walk around in green, proudly declaring their allegiance to this ""secret Society"" that is actually laughing at them, as it slowly kills them.

He rejected her strength‚Äînow he‚Äôs begging for the love he burned.
(Can anyone post link? I might know where to find it üëÄ)","My mate cheated on me.  
  
On my birthday, Alice sent me a video‚Äîit showed a high-end bar where a man in a suit and mask was ""training"" a sexy woman dressed in a bunny outfit.  
  
The bunny girl had a seductive figure, wearing a ball gag, following his directions to perform one sultry pose after another.  
  
My blood ran cold instantly.  
  
After the video, a voice message popped up.  
  
""Elara, I know this isn't right, but I thought the dominant guy looked like your Alpha... Is he with you right now?""  
  
Alice was right. Even with the mask, I could recognize my mate...  
  
His magnetic voice came through our mindlink.: ""Ela, darling, I'm too busy to come home today. I've added you to my card‚Äîgo buy yourself something nice.""  
  
His voice sounded languid, with a hint of breathlessness.  
  
""Is he mating with someone else?!""  
  
My wolf growled with fury.  
  
Our matebond began to ache.  
  
I tilted my head back, wiped away my tears, and called Ms. Mercer.  
  
""I'm willing to sever the mate bond with him, but all the conditions I proposed are non-negotiable.""  
  
The voice on the other end sounded excited, agreeing immediately: ""Done!""  
  
The next day.  
  
I stood outside his office.  
  
Just as I was about to knock, I detected an unusual scent.  
  
I took a deep breath, raised my hand, and knocked.  
  
""Come in,"" his magnetic voice came from inside.  
  
I gripped the documents in my hand tighter, placed my other hand on the doorknob, and as I entered, I put on a faint smile. I walked to his side and gently placed the documents in front of him.  
  
""Busy? These papers need your signature.""  
  
He signed his name hastily without even looking at them.  
  
Then he stood up and embraced me. ""Sorry, darling. I was on a business trip yesterday and couldn't celebrate your birthday. I noticed you didn't spend any money on the card. Nothing you liked? There's a new jeweled ring collection‚ÄîI'll have Ronan send one over later.""  
  
I pushed him away subtly. ""No need.""  
  
I gathered the signed documents and asked one final question: ""Were you really on a business trip yesterday?""  
  
His expression didn't change at all. ""Of course. You can ask Ronan.""  
  
""Alright, I'll be going then.""  
  
I left with the documents, my smile already cold, transformed into a contemptuous sneer as I turned away.  
  
Just as I reached the door of his office's adjoining rest area, I heard a slight noise from inside, like a small creature jumping from the bed to the floor.  
  
I instinctively stopped, glanced sideways, and saw stockings scattered on the coffee table by the sofa, with a pink bra nearby. Clearly, they had been quite passionate.  
  
""She's still in there? Go in and tear her apart!""  
  
My wolf was furious, already trying to control my throat to emit a growl.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Back in my office, I nearly collapsed into my chair. My chest was filled with something‚Äîacid, grievance, humiliation‚Äîmixed with my wolf's rage, almost overwhelming me.  
  
I pulled out the thinnest document from the stack‚Äîthe divorce agreement.  
  
I flipped to the last page, staring at that familiar yet pale handwriting, my finger gently tracing over the strokes. The same hand that once held mine and solemnly promised ""I will marry you"" had now decisively signed our divorce papers.  
  
His business trip was a lie; the affair was the truth. He even brought her to the company, into his office, making love right under my nose!  
  
And he still had the audacity to pretend to be nice to me. My stomach churned.  
  
I photographed the signature page and sent it to Mercer: ""He signed it.""  
  
This was the outcome we had already negotiated. She would provide a billion-dollar settlement, on the condition that I never revealed our secret marriage.  
  
I had one more requirement‚Äîshe would help me leave completely, making it impossible for Rowan to ever find me again.  
  
""Knock, knock.""  
  
There was a knock at the door.  
  
I closed the divorce agreement. ""Come in.""  
  
It was his personal Beta, Ronan.  
  
He placed a dark green velvet jewelry box in front of me. ""This is from the Alpha for the Luna.""  
  
He still respectfully called me Luna, even though I was no longer Rowan's only one.  
  
I casually opened the box to find an expensive set of moonstone jewelry. At that moment, what flashed through my mind was the image of a girl in a half-wrapped bathrobe, proudly placing this necklace around her neck under ambient lighting, the kiss marks on her chest like a mockery.  
  
Nausea rose in my throat.  
  
""She's defiling our bed, Elara. We shouldn't forgive this.""  
  
Suppressing my wolf's anger, I looked up and smiled at Ronan.  
  
""Thank you, Beta.""  
  
Ronan tensed at my gaze.  
  
He awkwardly added: ""The Alpha personally selected this set. It's one of a kind, worldwide.""  
  
""Is that so? How thoughtful of him to remember to send me a gift despite his busy schedule. How touching.""  
  
Ronan's expression froze, clearly guessing something, and he quickly left the office.  
  
I swallowed my discomfort and took out my phone to call the werewolf orphanage directly.  
  
""Sell this jewelry set for me and buy food for the children.""  
  
At five in the afternoon.  
  
I walked to the underground parking garage. Just as I opened my car door, I looked up and saw that car not far away‚ÄîRowan's car.  
  
He sat in the back seat, and that girl... that girl with short hair, a round face, and youthful, almost flawless beauty, was leaning on his shoulder.  
  
Their scents intertwined, drifting through the car window gap. I stood motionless.  
  
""Alpha‚Äî!"" Ronan's alarmed cry came from inside the car, accompanied by a sudden brake.  
  
I finally looked up, and through the glass, Rowan and I locked eyes.  
  
Did he even remember who I was? His Luna.  
  
The wolf inside me growled softly, grief and anger intertwined.  
  
His eyes were ink-dark, as deep as the night sky before a storm.  
  
Mine were like dead water, completely still.  
  
The air in the garage seemed to solidify, each breath mixed with the scent of metal and desire.  
  
The girl saw me. But instead of restraining herself, she seemed to flaunt it, clinging to his neck even more brazenly, whispering something against his ear, her face full of triumphant satisfaction.  
  
My wolf howled inside, its claws repeatedly pounding against my ribcage: ""Tear her apart, Elara! She touched our mate‚Äî""  
  
""He's not ours anymore.""  
  
My eyes felt like they were burning. I lowered my head, turned around, got into my car, started the engine, and left in one fluid motion, without giving him another glance.  
  
My wolf churned inside my mind‚Äîanger, shame, abandonment‚Äîall washing over me at once. I could barely maintain control.  
  
When I got home, I didn't sit down but went straight to the closet.  
  
Before I could move, a wall of burning flesh pressed against me from behind.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
His scent swept over me like a tide, familiar yet repulsive. The Alpha's smell enveloped me completely‚Äîit was the mark we once shared in fusion, but now it nearly made me sick.  
  
""Are you angry?"" His voice was hoarse against my ear.  
  
I didn't look at him, just calmly put the necklace away, my tone cold: ""Angry enough to kill. You'd better be careful, or I might lose control.""  
  
He was silent for a moment. The air's scent became tense with our emotional clash, as if a single spark could ignite the entire space.  
  
""Ashenford pack wants to collaborate with us on the North Star project. Moira is their most beloved princess‚Äîthis is a negotiation tactic.""  
  
""So?"" I slowly turned to face him. ""If you don't entertain his sister, he won't sign the contract?""  
  
His eyes suddenly went cold: ""Elara, I'm explaining to you. Don't be so passive-aggressive.""  
  
""Explaining?"" I laughed, cold as a knife. ""Rowan Mercer, if you're bored and want a new Luna, just say so. I don't have to keep this position.""  
  
His face instantly darkened: ""What did you say?""  
  
""I said‚Äîwe can get divorced.""  
  
I pushed him away, preparing to leave. But he moved faster, suddenly grabbing me, his fingers digging into my chin with such force I could almost hear my bones creak.  
  
His Alpha aura fully released; the pressure of his dominant presence made even my wolf whimper submissively.  
  
""You'd better not even think about that.""  
  
""Not only is she thinking it, she's doing it. She doesn't love him anymore.""  
  
That night, he was called away by another phone call. I sat by the bed and heard a sweet female voice on the other end, crying and calling him coquettishly: ""Rowan...""  
  
The next morning, my friend and lawyer sent me a screenshot.  
  
Rowan's girlfriend had posted a selfie from the mountaintop last night. In the photo, a large hand and a small one formed a heart against the background of sunrise, with the caption: ""Feeling each other's heartbeats in the gentle embrace of dawn.""  
  
I immediately recognized his hand.  
  
I sat still, clutching my water glass for who knows how long, until my palm was cold and wet, my knuckles white.  
  
When I finally put the glass down, it hit the table with a sharp sound.  
  
It seemed... at that moment, a corner of my heart also broke.  
  
For several days after that, he didn't come home.  
  
We only saw each other once at a high-level meeting.  
  
He sat at the head, while I sat with other executives on either side. Throughout the meeting, he didn't say a word to me directly, nor did his eyes ever linger on me.  
  
I didn't go upstairs to find him.  
  
In my free time, I was busy looking at houses. I also cleared out all the gifts he'd given me over the years: anniversaries, birthdays, Valentine's Days, wedding anniversaries... I even sold my wedding ring.  
  
If I didn't want the person anymore, what was the point of keeping these things?  
  
We don't need mementos. We'll have a new den.  
  
My wolf muttered softly, surprisingly calm. I knew she'd had enough too.  
  
Late at night, Isabella‚Äîthe owner of the private club ""Moon Dome""‚Äîsent me a message inviting me for a small gathering.  
  
Close to eleven, I had already changed into my nightgown, but thinking about how I'd need to rebuild my network after divorcing and leaving the Mercer pack, I ultimately chose an Armani haute couture suit and went out.  
  
As soon as my black Maybach stopped in front of the club's gilded doors, Isabella came out to meet me, walking on Jimmy Choo stilettos.  
  
""Darling, I'm so glad you could come."" She affectionately took my arm, a hint of Chanel No. 5 wafting past. ""Let me take you upstairs. The newly renovated VIP level can be confusing.""  
  
I smiled: ""Actually, a waiter could have shown me the way...""  
  
The mirrored elevator took us straight to the top floor, where she pushed open an ornately carved walnut door. A Venetian glass screen divided the private room into two sections. From the other side came the rich aroma of cigars and the sound of deep laughter. But Isabella only led me to a chair near the door.  
  
The woman sitting there looked somewhat familiar‚ÄîI think she was the companion of one of Rowan's friends. She seemed to recognize me too, her expression a bit unnatural, though she still forced a smile and nodded.  
  
After Isabella left, I accepted a drink from a server and took a small sip, planning to rest a bit. But my thoughts were completely interrupted by voices from the other side of the glass door.  
  
""Speaking of which, Rowan doesn't bring Elara to gatherings anymore.""

1l7qwan,https://www.reddit.com/r/FiveStarBedding/comments/1l7qwan/are_grounding_sheets_dangerous/,Are grounding sheets dangerous?,"So here‚Äôs a phrase I never thought I‚Äôd be typing into Reddit at 1 a.m.: **are grounding sheets dangerous?**  
I stumbled onto this question after reading some buzz about **Terra Grounding Bed Sheets** in a sleep thread. People were throwing around terms like ""Earth‚Äôs energy,"" ""inflammation relief,"" and ""EMF protection."" Naturally, I rolled my eyes. But then I saw post after post saying these sheets had improved sleep, reduced pain, and helped with recovery.

Still, plugging anything into my wall and sleeping on it all night? That raised a few red flags.

So I did what any normal person would do, I read every **grounding sheets review**, dug into the science, and finally tried one for myself. Here‚Äôs what I found out.

**First: are grounding sheets dangerous? The short answer is no.**

This was my biggest concern. But **grounding sheets for bed** don‚Äôt use electricity. The plug only connects to the ground port of your outlet, not the power. That means there‚Äôs no current, no voltage, no risk of shock.

Still, your outlet *must* be properly grounded. If it‚Äôs not, the sheet won‚Äôt work as intended, and in rare cases, could actually increase exposure to stray current. I bought a cheap outlet tester on Amazon just to be sure. If you live in an older home, I highly recommend checking.

The **Terra grounding sheets** I used came with clear instructions and safety info, and the brand itself had a solid reputation, which made me feel better. It also helped that they‚Äôre one of the better-known **grounding sheets made in USA**.

**Here‚Äôs the one I used (with full safety instructions included):** [**Terra bed sheets**](https://terragrounding.co/products/the-terra-grounding-bed-sheet/?lpid=1070&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1070&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1070&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1070&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/FiveStarBedding)

**So, what are grounding sheets supposed to do anyway?**

The idea is based on something called ""earthing"" - making direct physical contact with the Earth‚Äôs surface. That contact supposedly allows free electrons to enter your body, helping to neutralize free radicals, balance cortisol levels, and improve sleep.

Of course, most of us wear shoes, live in buildings, and sleep on elevated beds, totally disconnected from the Earth. **Earth grounding bed sheets** simulate that barefoot contact indoors using silver-threaded fabric that‚Äôs conductive.

Sounds a little out there, right? I thought so too. But there‚Äôs some legitimate science backing it up. A few studies (searchable on PubMed) showed that people who used **earthing bed sheets** had reduced nighttime cortisol, fewer sleep interruptions, and even less inflammation.

**Week 1: Mostly just me wondering if I wasted money**

I didn‚Äôt feel much the first few nights. But I kept using it. Setup was simple, plug one end of the cord into the sheet‚Äôs snap connector, and the other into a grounded outlet.

The sheet itself felt like normal bedding. No buzz, no warmth, no sensation. I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúgrounded.‚Äù It just felt like sleeping.

**Week 2‚Äì3: The quiet shift**

This is where things changed. I started waking up less often, and when I did, I fell back asleep quickly. I usually wake up groggy and need two cups of coffee to feel human, but that grogginess started lifting.

Also, the nagging hip tightness I get from sitting all day at work? Less noticeable. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that.

**Week 4+: Better sleep, less pain, and no side effects**

At this point, I was sleeping straight through most nights. My body felt less achy, and I was getting out of bed without the usual lower back protest. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a cure-all, but it definitely shifted my sleep and recovery in a meaningful way.

I‚Äôm also glad I verified my outlet was grounded, because that‚Äôs a detail a lot of people overlook. If you‚Äôre going to try this, do it safely.

**Here‚Äôs the exact grounding sheet I used for 6 weeks:** [**Terra sheet**](https://terragrounding.co/pages/adv-doctor-v3/?lpid=2559&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1070&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1070&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2559&oid=1070&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/FiveStarBedding)

**Pros and cons (if you‚Äôre weighing the risk)**

**Pros:**

* Safe to use on a properly grounded outlet
* No electricity involved
* Easy setup, no noise or weird tech features
* Reduced sleep interruptions
* Helped reduce pain and stiffness over time

**Cons:**

* Requires a properly grounded outlet (test it!)
* Slightly more expensive than standard sheets
* No fabric softener or bleach in the wash
* Takes a few weeks to notice effects

**So, are grounding sheets dangerous or helpful?**

In my experience, they‚Äôre **not dangerous at all**, as long as you follow the instructions. No shocks, no overheating, no weird interactions. Just a grounded connection and a sheet that looks and feels normal.

As for whether they help? I was a skeptic, and I‚Äôm still not ready to say they‚Äôre life-changing for everyone, but for me, they‚Äôve made a real difference in sleep quality and daily pain levels.

If you're asking ""do grounding sheets work"" or worried about risks, I'd say give them a shot - but test your outlet first and use a reputable brand. If anyone else has tried **terra therapy grounding sheets** or had different results, I‚Äôd love to hear what you noticed. Better sleep? Nothing?

Because I know I haven‚Äôt become the woman I want to be for her I‚Äôm still growing I‚Äôm still learning how to stay up longer to play with her hair To sing her lullabies when she has nightmares To give her kittens and maintain food on the table To be myself around her and show her that I‚Äôm capable

As the kettle still wouldn't turn off, I pulled harder and harder until I realized I was holding the damn socket in my hand. I tried to disconnect the plug from the socket using only my right hand, (the kettle was still in my left). During that attempt, I got an electric shock and spilled scalding hot coffee all over myself. After about 4 seconds (I think; everything seems slower when you blink very quickly), all the coffee was on me. At first, I was glad my armor saved me from the heat and I only got the 230V. But the realization of what it would do to the metal slowly settled in. In panic I ran into the dark, trying to reach the fuse box downstairs. Unable to see, I stumbled and fell down the stairs.

On April 14th, my boyfriend and I had sex - he used a condom the whole time and came inside with it on. My periods are usually pretty regular, coming every 30-32 days. Right on schedule, I got my normal period on May 2nd. It started light but got really heavy by the second day, with some small dark red clots (about the size of raisins). The heavy flow lasted 3 days, then tapered off over 4 more days - so 7 days total, which is normal for me.

But right after my May period ended, I started feeling really off. I've had constant headaches that feel like pressure around my forehead, I'm exhausted no matter how much I sleep, my nose is always stuffy (and I've had 3 random nosebleeds this month). I even had a low fever (37.7¬∞C) for two days last week. The weirdest part? My taste is totally messed up - coffee tastes metallic, my favorite pineapple now tastes bitter, and I have this gross sour taste in my mouth all the time.

Then on June 5th (exactly 34 days after my May period started), I got my next period. It began with some small clots again (like little jelly blobs), was heaviest on days 2-3, and now on June 10th it's just light spotting. But I still feel awful - still tired, still that nasty taste in my mouth, and zero appetite. I know we used protection and I've had two normal periods since, but why do I still feel like this?

I thought the handyman offering in my name would get me by while I was looking for the bigger jobs that I would rather be doing, but so far in a year I've only had 2 calls for hit it and quit it handyman work, changing two ceiling fans, and to hang a TV. People started calling me to do screened in porches, whole house painting, wall rebuild, etc. And i couldnt be more grateful I've aquired the jobs that I've wanted to obtain so far.

Anyway, while I'm not super adept, I enjoy woodworking a lot, and I get excited at the prospect of working on a unique, specialized product, and also thinking I will get calls to do similar work in the future too. A return client just accepted my quote to make a custom coffee shelf. It's gonna be floor to ceiling, wall mounted golden oak stain (kinda boring but that's okay), and she has a shit ton of coffee cups she says, so the whole wall will be staggered with individual boxes just big enough for the coffee cups to fit in. Also each box will be between 4 1/2"" x 4 1/2"" up to 6 1/2"" x 6 1/2"". And the ceiling is vaulted so there will be a slant from 96"" to 102 1/2"" as well. Gonna dado groove the verticals for a tight glued into fit of the horizontals.

Each year, for most of my life, I have and still do volunteer at the local church's Greek Festival, and I regularly light candles in memory of my parents and sibling who have passed. There's something deeply healing about that ritual, extremely cathartic.

Lately, I've been more involved with the church, but it's the Greek cultural connection that draws me, not the religious aspects. My Greek heritage is something I carry with pride. When I do attend services, I'll admit I often arrive late and stay mainly for the friendships I've developed afterward, the antidoron and coffee hour are honestly my favorite parts.

What's been most meaningful is how the church community has responded since I've been open to some about my lack of religious belief. Every person I've shared this with has been incredibly supportive and accepting. There's been no judgment, just understanding‚Äîwhich says so much about the people there. I know for sure that there are many many more like me. 

Curious how others here view me / my type where you're from? It's sort of like friends of mine who are Jewish but see being Jewish as a cultural thing and not a religious thing. They go to synagogue at times, they and their kids have had bar mitzvahs, but they aren't really believers. All very interesting!

1l7qn1b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7qn1b,A Chengdu Travel Plan,"We just made a 3-day Chengdu travel plan for everybody and hope this plan will be helpful to you.

On the first day, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and Chengdu People‚Äôs Park will be the destinations of the day. In the morning, straight to the pandas‚Äô base, we can see the pandas chewing bamboos and rolling on the ground. In the afternoon, at Chengdu People‚Äôs Park, let‚Äôs find a spot under the trees by a tea house, order fragrant tea, chat with friends and watch the afternoon light dapple through the leaves.

For Day 2, we will head to Wenshu Monastery or Mount Qingcheng, and Dujiangyan. If you are interested in Buddhist culture, Wenshu Monastery is a good choice. At Wenshu Monastery, we can burn incense sticks and pray for blessings. Alternatively, Mount Qingcheng is for the ones who like Taoism. Hiking along the misty paths shaded by ancient trees, we will breathe the air thick with serenity. Passing the quiet Taoist temples, we can really feel the deep spiritual energy of the place. In the afternoon, we will take a ride to Dujiangyan, to admire the spectacular scenery and the wisdom of the ancestors.

On the last day, we are going to Taikoo Li Chengdu and Luxelakes Water City. In the morning, at Taikoo Li, we can see the collision and fusion of history and modernity. Also it‚Äôs a good place for shopping. After that, let‚Äôs end the journey with a cozy afternoon at Luxelakes Water City. Wandering on the islands, grabbing a coffee by the lake, taking a boat and watching sunset painting the buildings, we can feel the slow rhythm of Chengdu has already sunk into our bodies.

Besides, Chengdu is a city famous for its tasty food. We can have a try of Chengdu‚Äôs hotpot and Chuanchuan, which can be easily got in the streets and alleys.",6,1749532698.0,travelchina,0,1.0,False

1l7qmhb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7qmhb,Life Has Loveliness to Sell...,"Anno is an amazingly meditative experience.  I'm reminded of my friend, an old man who has since passed away.  I in my 20's, and he in his 80's, we spent a lot of days sitting in his office while he fiddled around with Stock Trading, or out in the Gazebo near his garden which he continued to tend each year - or, in many cases, we would go to an old diner and sit in there for hours drinking coffee.  He shared his perspectives, I shared mine, and even though there was 60+ years separating us, we treated each other like equals.  
  
He said - over and over again - ""Life has loveliness to sell.  Buy it, and never count the cost.""  Years passed - and he passed away.  I moved on with my life - and then, in my 30's, started to rekindle my gaming hobby.  I had some successes in life, and some crushing setbacks.  But I always remembered that saying which he used to share.  Increasingly, I've focused less on experiences that impose obligation, and more on the ones which offer lovely experiences.  I try to fill my mind with things that are positive, uplifting, and respectful.  
  
Competitive games fell by the wayside - along with much of my competitiveness in real life.  Grinding for progression lost its appeal.  And I found myself at the end of a path, just learning to make peace with the experience, to love the journey for its own sake.  The number of games I played got shorter - and games like Anno rose to the top.  And it hit me - Anno is a game that makes me actually feel better after I'm done playing than I did when I started.  It helps me clear the fog out of my head.  It is uplifting, and hits just right.  
  
And so, I guess, as the hours pass and I add trade routes and new decorations to my islands, I realize in an odd sort of way, I finally understand what my old friend actually was talking about when he told me to buy loveliness, and never count the cost.  Life is supposed to be filled with joy, enjoyed for the experience rather than the destination - and in a world filled with progression milestones and FOMO, sometimes the best thing you can do for your soul is to pour a fresh cup of tea and just... be.",32,1749532641.0,anno,1,1.0,False

My partner and I are about to move into a new apartment, and we‚Äôve decided to each have our own bedrooms to decorate and use however we‚Äôd like. That said, we‚Äôll still be sharing a bed in one room most nights.

In my room, I want to focus on creating a personal lounge and gaming space rather than setting it up as a full bedroom. I‚Äôm hoping to avoid taking up too much space with a bed, but I do want a backup sleeping option for times when I need to wake up early and don‚Äôt want to disturb my partner.

Right now, I‚Äôm considering a futon that would primarily serve as a couch, along with a coffee table and entertainment setup. I‚Äôm also thinking about keeping a memory foam mattress topper in the closet that I can lay out on top of the futon when needed.

For those who have tried something similar, is a futon and memory foam topper combo actually comfortable enough for a good night‚Äôs sleep every now and then? Or is it likely to feel too makeshift?

The main challenge I'm running into is finding a futon that actually looks good. Most of what I‚Äôve seen online feels cheap, uncomfortable, or not very stylish. I‚Äôd love any recommendations for futons that are both comfortable and visually appealing, especially if they come in green or have a green option, since that‚Äôs the color I‚Äôm aiming for.

He had lived with us before during Covid lockdown and it was the worst. It really impacted my mental health having this lumber oaf around not contributing to rent, cooking or cleaning and watching my bestfriend look after her man baby of 30 years age. 
He would wake up every morning at 5 am and vape in the lounge drinking coffee, so you‚Äôd start you day inhaling his raspberry vape juice. He‚Äôd deny your claim saying he wasn‚Äôt vaping. 

We have a tiny house with 5 bedrooms and a kitchen/lounge that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of space to move around in when someone is cooking or someone is using the lounge. 

A year and half later she wants him to move in for a few months while they looked for a place to move in together. 
I said no as the house is too small and from his last stay with us over lockdown I knew he wouldn‚Äôt contribute to the flat at all and take up a lot of space. I also work in a very stressful job so the last thing I want to do is come home to this douchebag. 

I fought with this flatmate over text and not in person (embarrassing I know) I said a flat is not quite a democracy. Everyone has to be on board with a decision for things to move forward and me saying no should have been enough.

Ever feel like you're spinning your wheels but not getting anywhere? üôÑ Like you're trapped in that endless cycle of **busy work** but still can't seem to tackle the **biggest priorities**? Yeah, me too. It‚Äôs exhausting, isn‚Äôt it? 

Let‚Äôs face it, sometimes we‚Äôre all just *floating through the daily grind*, surviving off coffee and sheer willpower. But what if I told you there‚Äôs a super simple trick that can flip that switch from chaos to clarity in just *10 seconds*? 

**So, what's the magic sauce?** The ‚Äú10-Second Rule‚Äù! Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Pause & Breathe**: Seriously, just take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose‚Ä¶ hold it‚Ä¶ and exhale slowly through your mouth. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
   - What‚Äôs that? You feel a little less like a headless chicken? Good!

2. **Ask Yourself: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ONE thing I can do in the next 10 seconds that‚Äôll move me forward?‚Äù** 
   - It could be as simple as jotting down a task, sending that email you‚Äôve been avoiding, or even just standing up and stretching. 

3. **Make It Physical**: If you can, *do it right then and there*. 
   - No procrastination allowed! Your future self will thank you for kicking the ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù habit to the curb. üöÄ

4. **Celebrate the Small Wins**: 
   - Yup, even if it‚Äôs just sending a text or organizing your workspace. Give yourself a mental high-five! üéâ

5. **Reflect for a Sec**: What did that feel like? Did it give you a sense of accomplishment? 
   - If you're still feeling stuck, rinse and repeat! 

**Why this works**? Because when you‚Äôre overwhelmed, your brain starts to short-circuit. The 10-Second Rule is all about ‚Äúchunking‚Äù down your tasks into manageable bites that you can chew on without choking. It‚Äôs like clearing the fog from your mind; suddenly things don‚Äôt feel so heavy.

Here‚Äôs a little backstory: I recently had a week from the depths of productivity hell‚Äîendless meetings, a to-do list that was laughing at me, and I felt like I was being crushed under the weight of it all. I decided to give this rule a shot and‚Ä¶ boom! Just breaking it down for those 10 seconds totally transformed my day. It was almost magical! ‚ú®

So next time you're stuck in that grind‚Äîwhen the world feels like it‚Äôs spinning and you're just trying to hold on‚Äîgive yourself the gift of *10 seconds*. 

Before you know it, you‚Äôll be gliding into clarity rather than drowning in distraction. 

And who knows? Maybe you'll discover your hidden productivity superpower along the way. What's been your go-to method for finding clarity in chaos?",1,1749532478.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1l7qkhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1l7qkhs/struggling_with_peak_performance_i_tried_nasal/,Struggling with Peak Performance?: üß† I Tried Nasal Breathing for 7 Days (Backed by Studies) and Saw a 23% Increase in Calm Focus & Energy üå¨Ô∏è,"**Ever find yourself buried in the chaos of your day and wondering if there's a simple fix to boost your focus and energy?** üå™Ô∏è I used to think I needed yet another cup of coffee or some elusive productivity hack to feel the flow. But friends, what if I told you that the answer might literally be right under your nose? ü§î

So here's what happened: I stumbled upon this mind-blowing concept‚Äî*nasal breathing*‚Äîyes, breathing mainly through your nose. Sounds too simple, right? But stay with me. I read this study which suggested that nasal breathing can significantly increase your calm and focus. Being the peak performance enthusiast that I am, I decided to try it for myself. **Here's what went down over the next 7 days:**

- **Day 1:** Honestly, I caught myself forgetting and slipping back to mouth breathing. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No surprise there. Old habits die hard!

- **Day 2-3:** I started using a reminder on my phone. Every couple of hours, a gentle nudge went off: ""Breathe through your nose, buddy!"" It felt odd at first, like I was micromanaging myself, but then something clicked.

- **Day 4-5:** This is when I really began to notice a shift. My focus was sharper, like clearing a misty windshield. Tasks I dreaded felt a notch easier, and I wasn‚Äôt crashing mid-day. üöÄ

- **Day 6:** The most unexpected change? A casual calmness. Moments that usually had me stressed just didn't get under my skin in the same way.

- **Day 7:** Feeling like a bit of a nasal-breathing ninja by now. I even tried it while exercising and...wow, the difference! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

**So, why does this work?**

- **More oxygen to the brain:** Nasal breathing increases nitric oxide, helping your blood and brain get more oxygen. More oxygen = more brainpower.

- **Natural filter:** Your nose has built-in filters that warm and humidify the air. This means fewer pollutants and less work for your body. 

- **Calm vibes:** Breathing this way engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps you chill out. 

*Why didn‚Äôt I try this sooner?* So simple, yet often overlooked. It's kinda like switching up your phone to battery saver mode‚Äîsame phone, but oh-so-efficient.

Anybody else tried nasal breathing? Did it Zen-out your day? Or maybe you‚Äôve got another subtle life-hack up your sleeve? Share your thoughts, experiences, or even questions. You never know whom you might inspire today! üåü",1,1749532439.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

STORE #10798 ‚Äì NIGHT SHIFT RULES
Read. Follow. Survive.

My manager didn‚Äôt say goodbye. Just handed me the sheet, tapped the black phone in the back room like it was sacred, and walked out.

I laughed.

By 2:00 a.m., I wasn't laughing.

12:15 AM ‚Äì The Vault

They told me to restock the cooler early in the shift‚Äîwhat they call ‚Äúthe Vault.‚Äù It's a big walk-in, cold as sin, lined with shelves of soda and energy drinks. There's the main Vault door, the one most customers see. Then there's the ice door, the one by the bags of ice in the freezer section. You can go from one to the other‚ÄîVault to freezer to ice door‚Äîbut...

Rule Six said:
‚ÄúAlways leave through the door you entered. Never the other way around. Never take anything with you if you use the wrong exit. Don‚Äôt talk to anyone. Don‚Äôt help. Just go back the way you came, then exit properly.‚Äù

Simple enough. But easy to forget.

I walked in through the main Vault door.

Started stocking shelves, turning bottles so labels faced out. Normal stuff.

But after a few minutes, I swore I heard something‚Äîa dull tap-tap-tap‚Äîlike fingernails on glass.

It was coming from the freezer door. The one leading to the ice case.

I didn‚Äôt go through it, but I looked. No one was on the other side. Just bags of ice stacked behind foggy glass.

I finished stocking and headed out the main door again.

But right before I stepped out, I caught something in the reflection of a glass soda bottle.

Behind me.
In the Vault.
A handprint.

Pressed lightly against the inside of the freezer door.

1:34 AM ‚Äì The Man in the Black Suit

Exactly at 1:34, the bell over the entrance chimed.

I looked up.

A man walked in. Black suit. Tie. Shoes that looked like they cost more than my car.

His face was clearly visible‚Äîunobstructed.

But I still‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt see it.

It wasn‚Äôt covered. It just didn‚Äôt register. Like my eyes could take in the shape of his head, his ears, the fact that he was looking at me‚Äî

But not his face.

Rule One.
‚ÄúIf a man in a black suit enters at 1:34 a.m., and you can‚Äôt make out his face, go into the back room. Don‚Äôt come out until the door chimes again.‚Äù

I bolted.

Didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt think. Just went straight into the back room and waited.

Four minutes. That‚Äôs all it was.

When the bell chimed again, I peeked out.

Store was empty.

But there, sitting neatly in the center of the counter, was a fresh cup of coffee. Steam still rising.

And right beside it: a $2 bill.

I left them both alone.

2:15 AM ‚Äì The Slurpee Incident

I was starting to relax‚Äîidiot move‚Äîwhen I heard it.

Splat. Splat. Splat.

The Slurpee machine was dispensing on its own. The sound was wrong, thicker than usual.

When I got closer, I saw why.

It wasn‚Äôt normal Slurpee. It was dark. Deep red. Too thick. It oozed.

I smelled copper.

Rule Two.
‚ÄúIf the Slurpee machine starts dispensing a dark red mixture, hang the out-of-order sign. Use the red-labeled bucket and cycle it through until it returns to normal. Two more buckets after it looks fine. If someone drinks it, don‚Äôt let them leave.‚Äù

I followed the instructions exactly.
Out-of-order sign. Red bucket. Recycle the machine.

After the third bucket, the Slurpee color finally shifted‚Äîcherry red. Then blue raspberry. Normal.

But I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Some kid‚Äîmaybe 12‚Äîstood by the counter. Drinking from a cup.

Red Slurpee.

I didn‚Äôt even hear him come in.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre giving these out for free tonight?‚Äù he asked, his voice too casual.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúYeah, uh‚Ä¶ yeah. Sure. You want chips, too?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúBarbecue.‚Äù

I handed them over, then dashed to the back room and grabbed the black phone.

Dialed 1072110798.

One ring. A voice answered‚Äîflat and calm.

‚ÄúRed Slurpee?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. A kid drank some. I kept him here.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Keep him calm. A team‚Äôs on the way. Do not let him leave. Do not let him touch anything else.‚Äù

The line went dead.

When I came back out, the kid was staring at the coffee counter.

Still. Silent.

His cup was empty.

His hand trembled slightly, like something inside him was pushing out.

‚ÄúYou got gum?‚Äù he asked, suddenly.

I tossed him a pack from the impulse shelf. He caught it with a twitch that was too fast.

A van pulled up out front five minutes later. Two people came in‚Äîno name tags, no small talk.

They walked him out.

I watched them drive off. No headlights.

6:00 AM ‚Äì Close Enough

When the manager showed up, I expected questions.

He didn‚Äôt ask a single one.

Just looked me over like he was checking for damage.

‚ÄúYou made it,‚Äù he said.

That was all.

He refolded the rule sheet, tucked it into my chest pocket like it was a badge, and added a small note in red pen.

1l7qhya,https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeTheory/comments/1l7qhya/seeing_life_as_a_set_of_stories_to_reach_certain/,Seeing life as a set of stories to reach certain goals. Machine of consciousness makes everything around have a Reason.,"¬†I want you to have another look on this simple visualisation of a ‚Äúsample goal‚Äù for every observer. This is a simple Fact-result (Fr) statement ‚ÄúI want a coffee and croissant‚Äù. It has some Dramaturgical potential (Dp). First the idea of 1Dp in your head appears and the goal is set. Number 1 here means achievement of the goal. If 0 is no goal at all, then we say 1 is a full achievement of the goal state. All that in between are a numbers and states of not fully emerged story.¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/amehnvn0916f1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dff45b38cb8a9689d3417f66b57ee361b0b407

Here we pretend the achievement of that goal took only 4 Planck times. To be able to see the graph of achieved goal in general. Idea of having a coffee brake appeared and formed till some exact Planck‚Äôs step of your life led to creation of this Fact-result statement, after witch you decided to do real action. This exact idea made you walk for 4 Planck‚Äôs seconds to the table where you have that croissant and coffee ready for you. Each step you were spatially closer to the goal and nothing disturbed you in the way.

At worse case some cat or spider could jump at you and you brake your ankle. And forget about coffee. Or a meteorite strikes your apartment at that moment. That are highly unlikely to happen events. But still they can happen and can effect your decision making.

In our case person got to their coffee in 4 Planck‚Äôs steps and mission was accomplished. Dramaturgical potential of that idea, that (Fr) event was rising through steps and got full number 1 meaning. And it took only 4 (Re) Reaction steps. Your brain set in front of table, felt a smell of fresh bakery and coffee, and ‚Äútold yourself‚Äù We made it buddy! You got your coffee, drink and let‚Äôs move on! We have a bunch of other goals to fulfil, you set before, and we need to create some more goals.¬†

This fulfilment or dismission of a set Fact-result event is somewhat sacral and fragile as for people. If you set a goal to become a best pilot in the world, you will follow it through some number of (Re) reaction steps of your life till you succeed or till you will be forced or desire by yourself to dismiss this goal as not valid for upcoming moment.

¬† What mind can‚Äôt stand is not fulfilled or denied goals. Recursion style behaviour. Constant (Re) events that loose the primal (Fr) task and repeat itself over and over.

For example you want to breakup with a girl, but you can‚Äôt do it because you are not ‚Äúready‚Äù now. All bad phycological states of human mind mostly come in a shape of that unfulfilled goal of some kind coming again and again into your head. Action running in circles with no conclusion.

https://preview.redd.it/h7n5g282916f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cd329182813c987e56e2b22babcd04771516f6

¬† Like if some kid saw a murder when he was small and later couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù and lived through his adult life with despair and ‚Äúcraziness‚Äù of some kid because that story with a dead people, that goal of killing was not fully understood by the brain of a child. He saw murder and got this terrible question in his head: ‚ÄúWhy adult people kill each other with such anger?‚Äù and in other words kid set a goal of finding an answer to this fundamental question.

¬† He grows on but nobody gives him answer that suits him. Nothing seams to logical for him to approve that behaviour. He thinks he didn‚Äôt get a proper answer and if due to bad luck later this guy met more bad aggressive people in life, he will confirm to himself that life works like that, everybody should hate and hurt each other. But he still can‚Äôt find right answer for that first childish fundamental thought: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. And this doesn‚Äôt let to close the cycle of fulfilment of that goal, answering why. He sees violence is pointless but it ‚Äúhas to move on‚Äù. This is a mind trap billions of people are in.¬†

Such inflated mind states suck out all time and energy that could be used for enjoying life.

Good idea would be to answer all your inner questions. Many of which need further personal research and effort.

There is no other way to feel really happy except of fulfilling all your goals or letting them go. Leaving some goal in a state ‚ÄúI will decide later‚Äù turns it into a burden that slows you down.

Coming back to the picture of getting the coffee we can imagine there are multiple long-term and short term goals like that. And they all effect each other, and goals of other people effect yours and so on, it is a big pile of probabilities, that are shown as playing cards at each step of the poker game. Players show what they got, then another turn goes, and player have other card combinations with a new perspectives.

So the process of playing poker step by step is a nice visualization of what dramaturgical potential does in this world. It brings rules, why 4 kings are great but 4 aces are better. And more important, the winner gets it all. If you got to your goal this turn, it might be because some one didn‚Äôt.¬†

Seeing the horizontal line of Planck‚Äôs time on the graph you might notice it has a certain Planck‚Äôs step in past when your dramaturgical potential started to effect the system, and It always will have a certain x Planck‚Äôs step in future when you stop to effect the world around you. Like for example when you die.¬†

The idea of showing ‚Äúgoal reaching process‚Äù in a graph if brought by quantum dramaturgical perception.

If the world is quantum dramaturgical in first place, it could be easily described though this Fact-result and Reaction events-quants.

(Maybe I‚Äôve read it under a different name‚Äîdrop more info if you can!)","Chapter 1 The Blind Date Blunder

‚ÄúI know, Mom. I'm in front of the caf√©. Call you later!‚Äù Emmanuel Lowe hung up on his mother impatiently.

The twenty-eight-year-old man had never been in a relationship.

After spending seven years in the army, he retired from the military and worked at a hospital in Yeringham for three years.

He was a gynecologist at the hospital and made eighty thousand a year.

Worried he would end up old and alone, Emmanuel's mother urged him to settle down. Since he had no idea where to begin when it came to dating, his mother took matters into her own hands and set him up on multiple blind dates.

Thanks to her efforts, he had gone on seventeen blind dates so far.

Alas, wedding bells were clearly not on the horizon for Emmanuel. It was frustrating. He knew he was just going through the motions at that point.

‚ÄúHelp! Someone help me!‚Äù

Right before Emmanuel entered the caf√©, he heard someone calling out weakly for help.

The cries came from an old man who had fallen on the roadside. Many pedestrians walked past him, but no one dared to stop and help him to his feet.

After all, helping the old man could be more trouble than it was worth if one ended up with an expensive lawsuit for injuring him further. No one would do something that risky and foolish.

It did not deter Emmanuel from stepping forward and helping the man to his feet. He asked, ‚ÄúAre you all right, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm fine! Thank you so much, young man! It's so hard to find people as kind as you these days. I must repay you for your kindness!‚Äù replied the old man with a smile.

Emmanuel realized then that the old man's attire was at odds with his airs. Despite his tattered clothes, the old man's clean hands looked like those of a man accustomed to wealth.

Still, he had no time to satisfy his curiosity. After confirming that the old man was unharmed, Emmanuel rushed into the caf√© for his blind date. He never once considered being repaid for his kind act earlier.

The caf√© was massive and practically structured like a maze.

Emmanuel's mother mentioned that his blind date was seated at table number eight. He wandered through the confusing caf√©, but before he could locate the correct table, he stumbled into a special area.

The lighting was softer there, and the floor was scattered with fresh petals.

The sweet scent of flowers wafted through the air. He wondered if he had set foot in heaven.

Emmanuel raised his eyes and immediately froze.

A beautiful, elegant woman sat before a table in the room.

It was no exaggeration to say she embodied perfection itself.

The heavens clearly decided to shower all their favors on her.

The woman quietly sipped her coffee with her legs crossed neatly to the side. On the table was a non-translated copy of The Power Broker.

When she noticed Emmanuel barging into the room, she looked up at him in confusion and disgust.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

When Emmanuel recovered from the shock of stumbling upon the beautiful stranger, he realized his heart was about to beat its way out of his chest.

Never once had he ever felt so attracted to a woman in his twenty-eight years of life.

The countless female bodies he had seen in his work as a gynecologist hardly appealed to him. At some point, he even wondered if he was attracted to women at all.

Against all odds, it seemed, the young woman before him made his heart race like a runaway horse.

Am I simply nervous, or am I already attracted to her?

More surprisingly, Emmanuel noticed a large number eight sign on the woman's table.

She's my blind date?

He took a deep breath to calm himself before approaching her table and taking a seat opposite her.

The young woman's expression grew increasingly flabbergasted. There was even a hint of hostility in her pretty eyes.

The audacity of this man! Barging into my private room is bad enough, but he's going to sit opposite me like it's nobody's business?

Emmanuel ignored her expression. It was not the first time a woman had scoffed at him.

They were free to go their separate ways after getting the blind date done and over with.

He introduced himself, declaring, ‚ÄúHi! My name is Emmanuel Lowe. I'm twenty-eight years old, and I work as a gynecologist. I make eighty thousand a year and don't own a car or a house.‚Äù

Any man would need an incredible amount of courage to say such things to a woman, but Emmanuel appeared unusually calm and unfazed.

The young woman stared at him in shock. A moment later, her lips curved into a smirk, and she replied with an introduction of her own.

‚ÄúNice to meet you. I'm Mackenzie Quillen. I'm twenty-seven years old with dual doctorates in finance and business administration from Harvard University. I made three billion last year, and I have a car and a house.‚Äù

Emmanuel was stunned.

What the heck is happening?

He always thought women on blind dates came with red flags.

Mackenzie, however, was arguably flawless.

Where's the catch? Perhaps she's mental? Or crippled? Or infertile?

All sorts of fantastical theories filled Emmanuel's mind.

Mackenzie smirked at his perplexed expression. The pride in her cool gaze was evident.

She deliberately introduced herself to put the stranger in a difficult spot and intimidate him into retreating.

As expected, awkward silence lingered in the air after her words.

Urgh, forget it!

Whether Mackenzie was telling the truth was beside the point. Emmanuel decided to go through all the motions so he could at least mollify his mother, even if the date did not result in a trip to the altar.

He declared, ‚ÄúI don't make much, but if you decide to date me, I promise I'll always protect and cherish you. I'll take over all the household chores so you can be a queen at home. Of course, I hope you'll allow me to preserve my masculine pride in front of my family. If we do get married, I can give you about five to six thousand every month.‚Äù

It was a well-worn script that Emmanuel recited in a single breath.

Mackenzie was dumbfounded at his earnest expression and apparent lack of shame at his much lower salary.

A long while later, she burst into a chuckle.

She had never met a man who could humor her so.

‚ÄúWhat are you laughing about?‚Äù Unimpressed by her reaction, Emmanuel continued, ‚ÄúI know I don't check all the boxes, but I promise I'll be a good and responsible husband if we're married!",1,1749531940.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I am 3 months from finally graduating university (hopefully). Not to sound boastful, but I think I might actually really be finished this time. I think I have good odds of passing this final class.

My long-term life goal is to become a game designer. I have a long way to go (my degree is in environmental science, lol) but I think I can get there.

I currently have a ""grown up job"". It is only part time. I am the PR guy for a small indie video game developer. I wait tables and do odd jobs on the side.

At current I probably earn like $3800 per month? My rent is $1100 (I have a roommate), my bills add up to like $200 tops, I have $4300 in liquid savings and $9900 in 0% interest student loans (I had to take them because I was a moron and I had to do a 5th year).

I am realising as I type that this might not be the appropriate subreddit for this question, but my question is, what do I do now? In life, I mean.

I am now earning $3800 at a minimum each month. I have spent the last 5 years living off of $2500 or less. I am a simple man. I eat simple food, I don't really go out that much. Outside of the odd book or discounted Steam game I don't buy much. Frankly if I have a kitchen well-stocked with fancy coffee beans, tall boy pilsners, and red wine, I am very happy. I have no idea what to do with this amount of income.

I have a job in the industry I desire, but I do not actually work in the ""department"" that I want to. I have vague ambitions for how to progress in game development (I'd like to be a designer for an AAA company and eventually work for an indie company) but I do not know where to proceed from my current PR posting.

Beyond that... what the fuck? I am a real adult now (Or at least I'm about to be, if I pass this damn course)? What the fuck am I suppose to do? I will probably never marry or have kids, and I really have no game plan from here other than my career goals that I mentioned. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

I have a Rocket Appartamento which I‚Äôve actually been really happy with and have installed the pressure gauge on the brew group. I‚Äôve been doing blooming style preinfusions with great results and then started experimenting with pulsing the pump on and to the middle sort-of-still-on position, as one does for presinfusion, but I‚Äôll kind of pulse it 2-3 times after a 15 second preinfusion bloom to try to keep my flow rate somewhat stable.

Is there any inherent reason why this is bad? My shots taste so much better than just the pre, regular and then post infusion shots I had been pulling. 

Context - I‚Äôm a coffee roaster with 10 years in the industry but haven‚Äôt dabbled much with full pressure profiling. I‚Äôm using one week off the roast medium roasts of dense specialty coffees. At the shop we pull straight 9-bar flat profile shots on the San remo Zoe which is alright but not spectacular
And I‚Äôve really been teasing awesome notes out of these coffees on the rocket but am
Nervous this is a bad way to do it.

I am getting 18 grams of powder. It fits the filter well. As opposed to before I am using the ootb temper and have less tools. The puck looks ok after pulling the shot. A bit wet (no screen in new location) on the top, but consistency as expected and no obvious channeling or unevenness in the used puck.

It takes about 35 seconds to get 40g of liquid through the single wall porta filter. Nice crema. I use the slightly higher temperature setting as it seemed to improve the taste.

And the coffee still tastes sour. How, why? This should not be an under-extraction anymore. Is it? Maybe it‚Äôs not perfect, but should I get an acceptable shot with these parameters?

## Key Features analysis

The bubble vase, while seemingly simple in design, often incorporates several features that contribute to its overall appeal and functionality.

**Material:** Bubble vases are most commonly crafted from glass, ceramic, or resin. Glass vases offer a classic, obvious look that allows the beauty of the flowers to shine through. Ceramic vases provide a more substantial, earthy feel and come in a wide range of colors and finishes. Resin vases are a durable and often more affordable option, making them ideal for high-traffic areas or households with children and pets. The choice of material significantly impacts the overall aesthetic and durability of the vase.

**Shape and Size:** The defining characteristic of a bubble vase is its clustered, multi-spherical design.The number and size of the bubbles can vary greatly, ranging from small, delicate arrangements to large, statement-making pieces. Sizes also vary,from petite bud vases ideal for single stems to larger vessels capable of holding substantial floral arrangements. The shape and size of the bubble vase should complement the surrounding d√©cor and the type of flowers it will house.

**color and Finish:** Bubble vases are available in a rainbow of colors,from clear and neutral tones to bold and vibrant hues. Clear glass allows the natural colors of the flowers to take center stage, while colored glass can add a subtle or dramatic touch to the overall display. Finishes also vary, including glossy, matte, and textured options. The color and finish of the bubble vase can be chosen to coordinate with existing color schemes or to create a striking contrast.

**Stability:** Due to their unique shape, bubble vases can sometimes be less stable than traditional vases. A well-designed bubble vase will have a weighted base or a carefully balanced distribution of bubbles to prevent tipping. It is crucial to consider the stability of the vase when choosing one, especially if it will be placed in an area where it is likely to be bumped or knocked over.

Key attributes of a high-quality bubble vase include:

* Durable construction
* Unique aesthetic appeal
* Versatile design
* Functional size

## Core Benefits

the bubble vase offers a range of practical and aesthetic benefits, making it a popular choice for home d√©cor enthusiasts.

**Enhanced Visual Appeal:** The bubble vase's unique and playful design instantly elevates the visual appeal of any room. Its organic form adds a touch of whimsy and sophistication, creating a captivating focal point. Whether displayed on a coffee table, bookshelf, or mantel, a bubble vase can transform a mundane space into a stylish and inviting one.

**Versatile Decorating Option:** The bubble vase is incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of decorating styles. It complements modern, minimalist interiors with its clean lines and geometric shapes, while also adding a touch of playfulness to more traditional or bohemian spaces. Its ability to hold both flowers and greenery, or simply stand alone as a sculptural piece, makes it an incredibly adaptable decorating accessory.

**Complements Floral Arrangements:** The distinct form of the bubble vase beautifully showcases floral arrangements. The individual bubbles create separate pockets of water, allowing for a more creative and dynamic display. This allows for a more natural and less constrained arrangement, enabling each stem to be seen and appreciated. It can also be used for propagating plants, with each bubble acting as a mini-incubator.

**Easy to Clean and Maintain:** Most bubble vases are relatively easy to clean and maintain. Glass and ceramic vases can typically be washed with soap and water, while resin vases can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. Regular cleaning will help to keep the vase looking its best and prevent the build-up of mineral deposits or algae. Ensuring the vase is properly cleaned helps to maintain the clarity and brilliance of the display.

Me and my friend have been friends since we were 6-7 years old, she‚Äôs two years younger than me. I‚Äôm 23, she‚Äôs 21. We have always been very close, the best of friends and have always gotten along. 

Recently, she‚Äôs been incredibly persistent in knowing where I am, what I am doing and who I am with. Asking that I share my location through Find My, and any time I am not at home or not responding as soon I usually do, she will flood my phone with messages. While I took this as just concern and curiosity, it has been so relentless and would ask me why I didn‚Äôt ask her if she‚Äôs free and why I didn‚Äôt include her. Mind you, I was in a doctor‚Äôs clinic with my mom for her monthly cardiology check up.

To add more to the issue, she loves going out to eat or have coffee, and would always ask me to go with her. We go to the restaurant/coffee shop, she turns up with nothing but her phone and expects me to pay for the whole thing. This would turn to a weekly occurrence, sometimes even 3-4 times a week. There are times I have been really craving a very specific restaurant, I asked her if she wants to go, my treat, she told me she‚Äôll go but it cannot be there since she‚Äôs not in the mood for it, even though ITS MY MONEY. She would even plan incredibly expensive things, include me in the plans, and then expect me to pay for it. 

She also very explicitly says that she‚Äôs jealous whenever I go out with friends that isn‚Äôt her. She would message me endlessly whenever I am out with someone else and would ignore me afterwards. She would try and make it all about her. I went out with a different friend to a japanese restaurant, and she said how dare i let my other friend order the same thing she does. Like wwhaaaattttt, it‚Äôs a very small menu üò≠

I‚Äôm growing incredibly tired of this behavior, whenever I tell her my issues with how she treats me, she will always try and deny it and make it seem like I‚Äôm the problem.

‚Äç

**Why This Pick?**  


It‚Äôs hard to like the Red Sox with Lucas Giolito (6.42 ERA) on the mound, friends. In his last outing, Giolito allowed the Angels (the Angels?!) to get 7 runs past him. I'll be frank ‚Äì it's not difficult to imagine a universe where Tampa Bay runs up a fast score here. And while starter Ryan Pepiot (3.20 ERA) isn‚Äôt necessarily my favourite Rays starter, he hasn‚Äôt allowed more than 2 ERs across his last 3 outings. I‚Äôm on the visitors to lock down a win again here.

1l7q3qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims2/comments/1l7q3qc/francis_j_worthingtons_first_night/,Francis J Worthington‚Äôs First Night,"When I was growing up, I love playing the Sims 2 and creative writing. I didn‚Äôt think until now (and thanks to reddit) that I could combine the two! So I‚Äôve recently started tracking my game play and making creative writing prompts roughly based on what happens in my game play throughs. I‚Äôm trying out different blog spots to use to attach links instead, but for now, this is what I imagined Francis J Worthington‚Äôs first night on campus to be like. 


     The cactus appeared to be mocking Francis by this point, its arms sticking up with its elbows bent at a perfect ninety-degree angle. It was laughing at Francis, mocking him and telling him how much it looked like the last cactus Francis saw, and the one before that, and the one thousand before that one. Everything was both completely new and nothing new to Francis. Just hours ago, before getting off the plane in the middle of nowhere, he watched the tree lined streets shading the brownstones turn into the dense city. Neither of his parents joined him on his ride into the city to the airport. It was him, his driver he had known for 18 years, and his luggage. His mother was most likely at a charity brunch or drinking champagne and his father was already in the city probably in a meeting- just the way Francis had always preferred it- quiet and alone.
     Now Francis counted the mocking cacti as the car passed them, remembering that the reason he chose a school on the other side of the country was for this newness that was quickly becoming stale. Francis did not recognize this driver; it was not his usual one. But he was the one holding the sign labeled ‚ÄúFrancis J Worthington‚Äù and he was the one taking Francis to his already furnished home his mother found and rented him.
     Francis‚Äôs driver stopped at a house that sat alone at the end of street, displaying the empty vastness in an even more insulting way. There was one house next door to his, filled with what looked like two women and a complete band set up on their roof. It reminded Francis of the nights he spent scaling the city streets when he didn‚Äôt go home from boarding school for the weekends because his parents wouldn‚Äôt know the difference between his presence- or lack thereof. He listened to the more liberal, wanton college students playing their rooftop bands and drinking IPAs dreaming of the day that would be him, but much further from home. But Francis didn‚Äôt know how to start a conversation with one of his new neighbors- he had hardly talked to women he wasn‚Äôt related to- and he was the new, east coast, rich kid he had learned to want to run away from.
     Stepping inside his new home, his luggage carted to the door and dumped by his driver, he noticed the designer was in on the scheme the cacti and desert were running. The inside was just as empty and stark as the outside. The beige wood floor blended with the beige walls that matched the brown dust. All the dark brown wood was the same from the piano, to the floor to ceiling bookshelf, to the long table with its matching chairs. Even the couch and bed frame were the same never-ending color of nothingness.
      Francis knew his butler would be coming in the morning, so he scavenged the refrigerator for something to tide him over until the morning. When he only found containers with precut foods for prepping, he resigned to getting a ride into campus to walk and find food. For a brief, fleeting moment, Francis instinctually turned to ask his butler to call him a car- but then Francis remembered he‚Äôs finally where he wanted to be, away from home and alone.
     By the time Francis‚Äô taxi dropped him off in the middle of campus, the beginning of semester festivities had started. Francis felt, as usual, like he was the last to arrive. Most of the parents had already left and the young students had already begun to fall into the swing of college away from home. Three friends sat in front of a coffee shop, sharing what they did over the summer, and Francis tried to determine if they were friends from high school or in their later years of college. A group of boys walked by, loud and boisterous, lightly pushing each other around while their perfect white smiles spread across their cheeks.
     The streets were not long, but they were loud and filled with young people. Francis began to take in and learn his surroundings: there were four streets lined with restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and small boutiques. The four streets created a perfect square, with a large open area in the middle. Francis noticed the middle area is what he considered a watering hole- a place where everyone gathered regardless of if they were prey or predator to each other. There were old wooden benches that could afford to be painted or repaired, a small stage, tables with flimsy, discolored umbrellas, and a surprisingly large patch of grass to lay a blanket in. The palm trees seemed both out of place and perfect, providing more shade than Francis expected.
     Francis found a taco shop after roaming the four small streets and memorizing his options. The lights were yellow, most of the advertisements were in Spanish, and the older, short woman taking his order spoke in broken English. It was almost foreign to Francis, although the Spanish sounded eerily similar to the Italian he was used to hearing in the city. He took his three foil wrapped tacos to the watering hole and sat on a bench to observe the animals. As he unwrapped his taco, struggling to keep his onions and cilantro in the small corn tortilla, he gently spread the green salsa across the top, like a Christmas ribbon his nanny decorated with. After his first bite, he immediately regretted not buying more water.
      As the sun set, and the sky turned into a swirl of pinks and oranges, the watering hole became more diverse. He recognized one of the women he saw in the house next door, nearly melting into a man covered in tattoos who was hardly paying attention to her. He noticed a group of men walking together, one in a thick grey sweater, another in a basic blue t-shirt, and the last one holding a pizza wearing a red and grey stripped shirt. They appeared to be heading to the same home and know each other well based on their flawless and flowing conversation. One of them briefly noticed Francis watching and instead of the dirty looks Francis was used to, the man smiled and nodded a quick hello.
     A group of women in togas ran past them, forcing all three men to trace the women with their eyes. The women were obviously together, and just like the desert he now lived in, they all looked the same but different.  A black woman with long black braids down her back led the group, followed by an olive-skinned woman with brown eyes and unruly brown hair. Behind them, a pale woman with bright red hair in space buns and black lipstick and eyeliner laughs as she tries to keep up with a lean, tall blonde woman with blue eyes. Behind them all, was another woman with red hair who seemed to enjoy her time with them and simultaneously wanted to be somewhere with less noise and people. For the first time since his quiet arrival, he wanted to talk to someone.
     As quickly as the women arrived, they passed by like one of the many tumbleweeds Francis saw on his drive from the airport. None of them noticed him with his lap full of foil and shirt stained with salsa. After the sun finally retreated and brought a brief relief from the direct sun, it got colder than Francis planned. He quickly called a taxi home and was reminded of how alone he truly was. On his way up his street, he noticed the tattooed man and the woman walking hand in hand into the home next door to his, rethinking if he saw two women that afternoon or a man and a woman.
     He took his laptop and a soda into the backyard to laid in the hammock to review his class schedule for the next day. ‚ÄúWhy Money Does Grow on Some Trees‚Äù taught by Professor Cale Stompel in Nigmo Hall at 5:00 pm. Francis closed his laptop and placed it onto the red clay tile under him, listening to the pool gently lap against the sides. He remembered the apathetic red-haired woman from earlier and hoped she‚Äôd be in his class tomorrow. He thought about the man in his stripped shirt and questioned if his smile and nod was one of notice or one of unconscious greeting. He thinks of his driver in the morning, of his parents‚Äô whereabouts at that exact moment, of the college students he watched at home and how different they were from these ones, and he fades into sleep, swinging in the desert night smelling the desert flower sprouting from the cactus against his fence.

1l7q1dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1l7q1dq/my_new_job/,My new Job,"When I started working the graveyard shift at the local convenience store, I was just looking for a paycheck. But they didn‚Äôt hand me a uniform first. They handed me a list of rules.

No one explained them. My manager just said:
‚ÄúFollow these. Don‚Äôt ask questions. If you screw up, you‚Äôll know why.‚Äù
He smiled like he was joking, but his eyes weren‚Äôt laughing.

Here‚Äôs the list. I keep a copy in my back pocket. If you're ever unlucky enough to cover a night shift here, you'll want to do the same.

Rule One: The Man in the Black Suit
If a man in a black suit enters at 1:34 AM, and you cannot make out his face‚Äîeven if nothing is covering it‚Äîgo into the back room and lock the door.

Don‚Äôt come out until you hear the doorbell chime again.

Don‚Äôt try to peek.
Don‚Äôt try to take a picture.
Just wait.

Rule Two: The Red Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine starts dispensing a dark red mixture, stop everything.

Hang an ‚ÄúOut of Order‚Äù sign on the entire machine‚Äînot just the red nozzle.

Get the red-labeled bucket from under the sink (marked ‚ÄúRed Slurpee‚Äù).

Cycle the machine into the bucket until it returns to a normal color.

Keep cycling for two full buckets afterward, just to be safe.

If anyone drinks the dark red Slurpee:

Offer them anything to keep them in the store.

Remain calm.

Use the black phone in the back room.

Dial 10711 followed by the store number (for example: 1072110798).

Say: ""Red Slurpee.""

Then follow every single instruction they give you.

Rule Three: Trash Time
Never take out the trash between 1:30 AM and 3:45 AM.
I tell the new hires 2 to 4 AM, just to be safe.

Rule Four: The CDC Guy
If someone from the CDC shows up with no paperwork, and it's not Sunday, tell him you don‚Äôt want the delivery.

It‚Äôs not milk.
It‚Äôs not donuts.
It‚Äôs not sandwiches.
It‚Äôs not safe.

Rule Five: The Little Girl
Sometimes a little girl shows up alone, usually quiet.

Let her pick what candy she wants.
Do not charge her.

There‚Äôs petty cash in the drawer under Register One.
Print a receipt, sign it, and place it in the box beside the cash.

Don‚Äôt tell the manager.
They already know.
They never talk about her during the day.

Rule Six: The Vault
Restock the walk-in beverage cooler whenever needed. But remember:

Items are never in the same place twice.

If you need to exit, only leave through the same door you entered.

If you exit a different door, go back in, then leave through the original entrance.

Never take anything with you if you used the wrong door.

Ignore any voices or people on the other side.

They are not customers.
They are not safe.

Rule Seven: The Emergency Outside
If someone runs in screaming for help and begs you to go outside with them:

Do not go.

Tell them you‚Äôll call the police.
If they insist, go into the back and use the black phone again.

Dial 10712 plus your store number.

Say: ""Emergency Outside.""

Follow instructions.

When you hang up, do not return to the front of the store until the black phone rings.

Answer it. The voice will say a code phrase.

For this store, it‚Äôs:

‚ÄúBreakfast Bite, Potato Split Top Bun.‚Äù

That‚Äôs your sign it‚Äôs safe again.
Don‚Äôt answer any other phones.

Rule Eight: The Coffee
7-Eleven always keeps coffee fresh.

Back when we had glass pots, it was every 15 minutes. Now it‚Äôs 3 hours max with the new system.

If you have the instant brewer:
Never let it run out of beans.

You don‚Äôt want to know what happens if it does.

Rule Nine: Pump 1
At exactly 3:33 AM, if a man comes in asking for $6.65 on Pump 1, and gives you a $100 bill:

Take it.

Place the change and signed receipt into the box under Register One.

This helps fund the little girl‚Äôs candy.

Don‚Äôt ask questions. Just do it.

Rule Ten: The Money
There‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôre picky about money handling.

If someone asks you to load a card over the phone, hang up.

If a customer tells you to keep a tip, you may keep it.

If someone leaves change and says nothing, print a receipt, sign it, and put it under Register Two.

If you find money that shouldn‚Äôt be there, and you haven‚Äôt had a customer in a while, put it in the Register Two box with a note:

Amount

Register time (not the wall clock)

The manager will handle it.

He always does.

That‚Äôs the list.
I‚Äôve followed every rule.
Some of my coworkers didn‚Äôt.

They don‚Äôt work here anymore.

Hell‚Ä¶ some of them probably aren‚Äôt anywhere anymore.

If you get the night shift, don‚Äôt screw around.
Don‚Äôt play hero.
Don‚Äôt test it.

Just follow the rules.

And whatever you do‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt drink the red Slurpee.

* Did you know that \~50% of people may not get enough magnesium? In today‚Äôs fast-paced world (work stress, post-pandemic anxiety, endless screen time) low magnesium could be quietly affecting your health. This essential mineral plays a huge role in keeping you calm and energized. 
* [YouTube Clip (1m:37s)](https://youtu.be/05WyRTjc0sU): ""50% of the population does not get adequate magnesium.""

# Why you could have a magnesium deficiency?

* Magnesium deficiency is strongly correlated with anxiety.

[https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/13\/4\/1136](https://preview.redd.it/2rfvpifr116f1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35c12848941b51b7bbec79f0f7429a72cb2fc85a)

* Other ***possible*** symptoms are heart palpitations, leg cramps, vertigo, panic attacks, hypertension, IBS, acid reflux.
* Some of these symptoms could also be caused by *vasoconstriction* which can lead to an increase in blood pressure - so measurable with a blood pressure machine. Magnesium acts as a ***vasodilator***.

[https:\/\/andreiatorres.com\/blog\/2022\/7\/13\/magnesio-citrato](https://preview.redd.it/0zbib2ssv06f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=96ab8ad46928c7cf3ab03eeb036e02c7d8b19497)

* As less than 1% of your total body magnesium  is stored in the blood, so,  the standard (& cheapest) serum     blood    test is not a good indicator for a deficiency.   The magnesium    RBC   blood   test is slightly better. From: [Magnesium: Are We Consuming Enough?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316205/) \[Dec 2018\]

>In          humans, red blood cell (RBC) magnesium levels often provide a      better      reflection of body magnesium status than blood magnesium      levels.  When     the magnesium concentration in the blood is low,      magnesium is  pulled   out   from the cells to maintain blood  magnesium     levels within  normal   range.   Therefore, in case of  magnesium     deficiency, a blood  test of   magnesium   might show  normal levels,     while an RBC magnesium  test would   provide a   more  accurate     reflection of magnesium status of  the body.   For exact    estimation of     RBC magnesium level, individuals  are advised   not  to   consume     vitamins, or mineral supplements for at  least one week    before       collection of RBC samples. A normal RBC  magnesium level  ranges       between   4.2 and 6.8 mg/dL. However, some  experts  recommend aiming      for a  minimum   level of 6.0 mg/dL on the RBC   test.

* Some have suggested the magnesium RBC test combined with the magnesium urine test would give a better diagnosis.
* Getting the the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of magnesium  from diet can be  difficult unless  you eat a lot of things like pumpkin seeds, almonds, ground flaxseed, spinach. Spinach also contains a [healthy source of nitrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-nitrates#2) as well as magnesium which converts to nitric oxide(NO) in your body - NO is a potent ***vasodilator***.

* Magnesium is also a cofactor in balancing glutamate (NMDA-glutamate receptor inhibition) and GABA (GABA^(A) receptor) levels. Excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA have a [seesaw relationship](https://nourishedblessings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2cc4b449-5610-4b75-bd3e-daf2ac9c2294-7.png). Neurotransmitter levels in the brain are difficult to measure especially as they have a very short [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life#In_biology_and_pharmacology), e.g. serotonin in the brain is purportedly just a few minutes.
* The physiological stress response through activation of the [sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system#/media/File:The_Autonomic_Nervous_System.jpg) also depletes magnesium. More detail: [Magnesium Status and Stress: The Vicious Circle Concept Revisited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761127/) \[Nov 2020\]
* Alcohol also depletes magnesium. From: [Magnesium deficiency and  alcohol intake: mechanisms, clinical significance and possible relation  to cancer development (a review)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.1994.10718430) \[Sep 2013\]

>First, alcohol acts acutely as a Mg diuretic, causing a  prompt, vigorous increase in the urinary excretion of this metal along  with that of certain other electrolytes. Second, with chronic intake of  alcohol and development of alcoholism, the body stores of Mg become  depleted.

# Why Vitamin D3/D2 from sunlight/food/supplements requires magnesium?

* Vitamin D (technically not a vitamin but a [secosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secosteroid);  as a micronutrient in food it could be classed as a vitamin)  will deplete magnesium stores from your body as D3/D2 needs magnesium to convert the inactive form of vitamin D to it's active form.

# FAQ

Based on feedback/questions from the comments (to integrate into the next 101(?) release of this post):

# #1 Which Form?

[https:\/\/www.migraineagain.com\/magnesium-supplements-for-migraine-management\/](https://preview.redd.it/ox006vfs216f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ddc5b099b2fbc24709c51ea3e46782025a31ec6)

Based on the *Video* and *Further Reading* links:

* Magnesium glycinate (which I take) has high bioavailability and glycine (amino acid) is a sleep aid.
* Magnesium L-threonate which [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ&t=4483s) recommends, purportedly passes through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), so better for the mind.
* The Mod at r/magnesium prefers magnesium chloride.
* Taking other forms that have a laxative effect can be counterintuitive as you may lose magnesium through increased excretion.
* Others in this post mention taurate and malate helped.

# #2 Antagonists

* There are some nutrients that are antagonists to magnesium.
* From the **Magnesium** section in [Vitamin and Mineral Interactions: The Complex Relationship of Essential Nutrients](https://www.deannaminich.com/vitamin-and-mineral-interactions-the-complex-relationship-of-essential-nutrients/) they are calcium, phosphorous and a high-intake of zinc.
* One symptom of too high calcium and/or too little magnesium is constipation and vice-versa for loose bowels.

# #3 RDA

* You could compare what is written on the back of your bottle/packet with the RDA here: [https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/:](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/:)

>Very large doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids  (typically providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been  associated with magnesium toxicity \[[57](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#en57)\]

* [http://www.vitamindprotocol.com/](http://www.vitamindprotocol.com/) :

>**How much magnesium should you take each day with vitamin D3?**

# #4 Anxiety

* Here are posts from [r/VitaminD that mention anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaminD/search/?q=anxiety&restrict_sr=1).

# #5 Dose/Timing

* I'm currently taking prepackaged ***Vitamin D3*** 2,000-4,000IU (dependent on my planned sunlight exposure) with K2 MK 7 in MCT oil (so already fat-soluble) drops in the ***morning;***
* 200-300mg ***magnesium*** glycinate (the milligram amount is  the amount of elemental magnesium so \~50-75% of the RDA) most ***nights***.
* Sometimes cod liver oil instead of the Vitamin D3 as it also contains omega-3 and Vitamin A.
* Vitamin D can be more stimulating; magnesium more relaxing/sleep-inducing (YMMV). When I took my Vitamin D3 in the afternoon or later I had insomnia.

I also take L-theanine with tea/coffee (for increasing GABA):

# #6 Magnesium Intolerance?

From r/magnesium sidebar:

* Magnesium Intolerance? Consider Thiamine (Vitamin B1)! [https://youtu.be/pBxWivhBdpA](https://youtu.be/pBxWivhBdpA)
* And helpful reply from u/Flinkle:

>You may have a thiamine deficiency/inability to activate thiamine because of your magnesium deficiency. That can cause the issues you've had when taking magnesium. You might try starting off with a good B complex, then add 25mg of thiamine, and bump up it if you don't have any issues with it after a week or so (it can make you feel worse before you feel better...that's why it's better to start low). I'm still working on raising my magnesium levels (without the issued you've experienced), so I don't take thiamine all the time, but I've taken as much as 500mg in one day, and it definitely makes me feel better.

>Today‚Äôs soil is depleted of minerals, and therefore the crops and vegetables grown in that soil are not as mineral-rich as they used to be. Approximately half of the US population consumes less than the required amount of magnesium. Even those who strive for better nutrition in whole foods can fall short, due to magnesium removal during food processing.

>Since 1940 there has been a tremendous decline in the micronutrient  density of foods. In the UK for example, there has been loss of  magnesium in beef (‚àí4 to ‚àí8%), bacon (‚àí18%), chicken (‚àí4%), cheddar  cheese (‚àí38%), parmesan cheese (‚àí70%), whole milk (‚àí21%) and vegetables  (‚àí24%).[^(61)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-61)  The loss of magnesium during food refining/processing is significant:  white flour (‚àí82%), polished rice (‚àí83%), starch (‚àí97%) and white sugar  (‚àí99%).[^(12)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-12)  Since 1968 the magnesium content in wheat has dropped almost 20%, which  may be due to acidic soil, yield dilution and unbalanced crop  fertilisation (high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the  latter of which antagonises the absorption of magnesium in plants).[^(62)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-62)  One review paper concluded: ‚ÄòMagnesium deficiency in plants is becoming  an increasingly severe problem with the development of industry and  agriculture and the increase in human population‚Äô^(.)[^(62)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-62)  Processed foods, fat, refined flour and sugars are all devoid of  magnesium, and thus our Western diet predisposes us to magnesium  deficiency. Good dietary sources of magnesium include nuts, dark  chocolate and unrefined whole grains.

>Magnesium is one of the seven major minerals that the body needs in relatively large amounts (Calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride, potassium and phosphorus are the others). But too much of one major mineral can lead to a deficiency in another, and ***excessive magnesium can in turn cause a deficiency in calcium***. Few people overdose on minerals from food. However, it is possible to get too much magnesium from supplements or laxatives.

From the start, we've been working on basic obedience like sit, lay down, stay, come, heel, relax, focus, middle, and more. However, about two - three months ago we moved on to public access training.

Yesterday we went to the coffee shop I go to a lot, and she was acting like a total pro. When we got there, it was slightly rough in the line, but she was almost nailing everything we have been working on, and then did something that nearly made me tear up with pride.

When we went to go sit down she walked ahead of me like I taught her, positioned herself next to the seat, and spun smoothly into place sitting beside my chair. It was so clean and perfect! I‚Äôd been training that move for weeks and she finally did it exactly right in public! üíñ

Of course, she got her well-earned pup cup instantly because she was such a good girl!

We practiced the ‚Äúfocus‚Äù technique I‚Äôve been working on‚Äîgently guiding her nose to my side to help her refocus when distracted. She sat, laid down, and was so calm the entire time. The workers kept complimenting us, which made everything so much better.

I am 3 months from finally graduating university (hopefully). Not to sound boastful, but I think I might actually really be finished this time. I think I have good odds of passing this final class.

My long-term life goal is to become a game designer. I have a long way to go (my degree is in environmental science, lol) but I think I can get there.

I currently have a ""grown up job"". It is only part time. I am the PR guy for a small indie video game developer. I wait tables and do odd jobs on the side.

At current I probably earn like $3800 per month? My rent is $1100 (I have a roommate), my bills add up to like $200 tops, I have $4300 in liquid savings and $9900 in 0% interest student loans (I had to take them because I was a moron and I had to do a 5th year).

I am realising as I type that this might not be the appropriate subreddit for this question, but my question is, what do I do now? In life, I mean.

I am now earning $3800 at a minimum each month. I have spent the last 5 years living off of $2500 or less. I am a simple man. I eat simple food, I don't really go out that much. Outside of the odd book or discounted Steam game I don't buy much. Frankly if I have a kitchen well-stocked with fancy coffee beans, tall boy pilsners, and red wine, I am very happy. I have no idea what to do with this amount of income.

I have a job in the industry I desire, but I do not actually work in the ""department"" that I want to. I have vague ambitions for how to progress in game development (I'd like to be a designer for an AAA company and eventually work for an indie company) but I do not know where to proceed from my current PR posting.

Beyond that... what the fuck? I am a real adult now (Or at least I'm about to be, if I pass this damn course)? What the fuck am I suppose to do? I will probably never marry or have kids, and I really have no game plan from here other than my career goals that I mentioned. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

1l7ps3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1l7ps3x/front_desk_supervisor_neither_forgives_nor_forgets/,Front Desk Supervisor Neither Forgives NOR Forgets,"I work at a hotel. It is very clear by the way people engage with me and my team whether they have ever had a job in customer service‚Ä¶like there is no way they would speak to me the way they do if they could even for a MOMENT imagine being in my shoes.

Prime example-

White lady(obviously) with HUGE glasses, comically large frames that give, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just quirkyüëâüèºüëàüèº‚Äù energy walks into our location.

She comes up to the front desk to check in. Early in the process she tells me she is going to buy a beer from our little market area. I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúOkay we can do that at the end.‚Äù

While I‚Äôm checking her in I ask for her to insert a card for the reservation. I will say, not every front desk person does this every time. A lot of them just say the expiration date and use the card on file. But this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo and I know that if we don‚Äôt get a card physically taken at check in(or at least look at the card since there are cameras at the desk) it is nearly impossible to win a case for damages. The argument that the card on file isn‚Äôt the one they meant/want charged etc can get the case thrown out real quick. 

ALSO I am the supervisor so I do things properly? I truly do not care that much if the other teammates follow procedure to the letter. They‚Äôre overworked and underpaid so unless it‚Äôs a huge deal I don‚Äôt make a stink about much. But I am under higher scrutiny and also don‚Äôt like fucking shit up so‚Ä¶sue me! I follow the rules!

She inserts the card and I wrap up checkout and give her the room keys. She then goes and grabs the aforementioned beer. I ask her if she wants to use the card on file, aka the one I just took the authorization on for the room(cost of the room, tax, and $20 rounded up per night).

Balistic! Immediately! ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I just pay for the beer?!‚Äù Well no‚Ä¶first of all I had no idea what beer you were going to pick out and like‚Ä¶they cost different amounts‚Ä¶have you been in the world before? Are you new here? Also why would I charge you for a mystery beer in the middle of check in? Like I haven‚Äôt even given you the keys and you‚Äôre thinking that I‚Äôm charging you for a beer that I DON‚ÄôT EVEN KNOW THE BRAND OF???

Proceeds to freak out on me, I change the card on file immediately. Worth mentioning that I had not CHARGED her card. I put an AUTHORIZATION on it. Similar to a ride-share app before you decide if/how much you want to tip. I inform her that the new card will be charged when she checks out, but the authorization will not be released until then as well. Pouty, furious, devestated‚Ä¶it was quite a show. 

Look, I‚Äôm not devoid of empathy. It was probably about a $500 hold which would stress me the fuck out if it was on an account I wasn‚Äôt expecting. I‚Äôm broke most of the time, it would be a huge hit(worth mentioning she was there for work so she makes enough money that they be sending her ass outta town‚Ä¶but still.)

That was not the issue. People throw tantrums on a daily basis where I work. Unfortunately working at a fairly nice and semi expensive hotel does not draw the most down to Earth crowd.

While I‚Äôm changing the card on file, she says something under her breath. I know it‚Äôs nasty but if you‚Äôre gonna say something nasty, say it with your chest. So I ask what she said(in the tone of ‚ÄúDid I miss something?‚Äù)

‚ÄúWhat are you, dumb? Why would you put that large of a hold on my card?‚Äù

OH MAMA!

So we‚Äôre doing name calling? Okay I see you!

What are YOU? Dumb? Why would I be taking money for a beer(that once again I had no idea the brand of and more importantly the price of) in the MIDDLE of checking you in?

Oh you think that‚Äôs the end of it? HA me too girl.

But no, the next morning I‚Äôm back at the front desk. One of the managers happened to be there, which was very rare. I had filled her in and on the fact that we were probably going to receive a negative review in the survey we send out to every guest when they check out the MOMENT I clocked in. Y‚Äôall know the camaraderie that forms in the face of entitled customers, resentment is thicker than blood.

She walks up and I had shit to do, she walked up to my manager to check out anyway so I was moving to restock the coffee station. Mama stops me in my tracks, ‚ÄúI think you should be here for this.‚Äù

Yippee.

I walk over to her and my manager. She then begins her monologue, fully berating me. Not using the word dumb again, but it‚Äôs dripping off every word that comes out of her puckered asshole of a mouth. At the end of her speech(that she clearly feel asleep daydreaming about), she says‚Ä¶and I quote‚Ä¶‚ÄùI think we can all agree you made a mistake.‚Äù

Girl. Be so for real.

I ain‚Äôt agreeing to SHIT. I say some noncommittal platitude and my manager apologizes profusely(fuck our 100% satisfaction guarantee because we gotta swallow the shit guests throw our way and smile and thank them for their understanding and patience.)

The end. Of that encounter. But not the end of the story. This is my petty revenge.

About a month later she walks through the doors again. Mind you, my eye sight and memory are absolute. Dog shit. Often guests walk up and I ask if they have stayed with us before, sometimes with a response of. ‚ÄúI was here last weeküëÄ‚Äù Like it‚Äôs rough out here for a guy like me.

But HER. I recognized her instantly, because of those STUPID fucking glasses.

She walks up and I pretend I don‚Äôt remember her, maybe she can tell it‚Äôs an act or maybe she can‚Äôt. She says very little, and I am vaguely warm with a dead look behind my eyes. ‚ÄúI hope you enjoy your stay.‚Äù She won‚Äôt.

I placed mama in room 513. Notoriously the worst room in the hotel. Management has expressed multiple times that it is a last resort, we only put someone in 513 if the hotel is fully sold out and they are the last one to check in.

We were at 46% occupancyüòà

Now, the worst room in a nice hotel is still nice. It‚Äôs not piss soaked sheets and mold in the bathroom. 513 is the last resort because when you open the curtains‚Ä¶nothing. A wall of steel. No natural light. 513 faces the water heater, and there is nothing outside the window except the cruel and cold sheet of metal that tells you‚Ä¶you are exactly where you belong.

You play, I play. It‚Äôs game, and no I can‚Äôt clap back or get physical or really do anything tangibly bad to you. But I don‚Äôt forgive, and I will not forget! Don‚Äôt play unless you‚Äôre willing to suffer the consequences.

I'm kinda obsessed. If you've been scrolling through endless K-beauty reviews trying to figure out what's actually worth your hard-earned cash, buckle up because we're about to talk about the **Pyunkang Yul Calming Line Gift Box Set** ‚Äì and trust me, this isn't just another overhyped skincare fad.

Ever wondered why some gift sets feel like a total rip-off while others make you want to hug the person who curated them? Well, this little beauty falls squarely in the latter category, and I'm about to tell you exactly why.

# What Actually Comes in This Magical Box?

Let's cut to the chase ‚Äì what are you actually getting for your $39.99? The **Pyunkang Yul Calming Line Gift Box Set** isn't messing around with tiny sample sizes that'll last you exactly three days. Nope, this baby comes loaded with:

* **Calming Low pH Cleanser** ‚Äì Because your face shouldn't feel like sandpaper after washing
* **Calming Toner** ‚Äì The hydration hero your skin's been crying for
* **Calming Toner Pad** ‚Äì For those lazy days when you can't even cotton pad
* **Calming Moisture Serum** ‚Äì Lightweight but packs a serious moisture punch
* **Calming Barrier Cream** ‚Äì Your skin's personal bodyguard
* **Calming Clear Spot Patch** ‚Äì Because breakouts happen to the best of us

[Check out this amazing gift set here](https://amzn.to/43BkaHL)

Now, before you roll your eyes at another ""calming"" skincare line (because honestly, how many times have we heard that promise?), hear me out. This isn't your typical marketing fluff ‚Äì there's actually some serious science backing up these claims.

# Why Pyunkang Yul Isn't Just Another Pretty Face

Here's where things get interesting. **Pyunkang Yul** isn't some trendy startup that appeared overnight with flashy Instagram ads. This brand has some serious street cred ‚Äì it was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic in Korea, a place that's been treating atopic skin diseases for over 47 years.

Yeah, you read that right. These aren't just cosmetic chemists throwing together whatever's trending; these are people who've spent decades dealing with seriously problematic skin. When someone with that kind of experience creates a skincare line specifically for sensitive and irritated skin, I tend to pay attention.

# The Ingredient Philosophy That Actually Makes Sense

What really sold me on this brand (besides the fact that my perpetually angry skin actually calmed down) is their approach to ingredients. While other brands are shoving 30+ ingredients into every product, Pyunkang Yul takes the opposite approach. Their famous Essence Toner? **Just 7 ingredients**. Seven!

IMO, this minimalist approach is brilliant. When you have sensitive skin, every additional ingredient is a potential trigger. By keeping things simple, they're basically eliminating the guesswork from your routine.

# Breaking Down the Star Players

# Centella Asiatica: The Skin Whisperer

You've probably seen this ingredient everywhere lately, but here's why it's actually worth the hype. **Centella Asiatica** (also known as Cica) isn't just some trendy botanical ‚Äì it's been used in traditional medicine for centuries to heal wounds and calm inflammation.

In this gift set, it's working overtime to soothe irritated skin and reduce redness. I've noticed that my usual post-breakout red marks fade significantly faster when I'm consistent with these products.

# Tea Tree Extract: The Acne Assassin

Before you panic thinking this is going to dry out your skin (looking at you, high school Tea Tree Body Shop phase), let me ease your mind. The **Tea Tree extract** in these formulations is perfectly balanced to control excess sebum without turning your face into the Sahara Desert.

# 5 Types of Hyaluronic Acid: The Hydration Squad

Here's where things get really nerdy (and I'm here for it). This isn't just one type of hyaluronic acid ‚Äì they've included **five different molecular weights**. Why does this matter? Different sizes penetrate different layers of your skin, so you're getting hydration from the surface all the way down to the deeper layers.

The result? Skin that actually feels plump and hydrated, not just temporarily dewy on the surface.

# The Real Talk: What to Expect

# Week 1: The Adjustment Period

Let's be honest ‚Äì your skin might not immediately throw a party when you introduce new products. I noticed my skin felt a bit different the first few days, but not in a bad way. More like... calmer? Less reactive to my usual triggers (stress, lack of sleep, that extra cup of coffee).

# Week 2-3: The ""Wait, Is This Actually Working?"" Phase

This is where things started getting interesting for me. My skin texture began improving noticeably. Those rough patches I'd been dealing with for months? Smoother. The occasional hormonal breakouts? Still happening, but healing faster and with less drama.

# Week 4+: The ""Holy Grail"" Realization

By week four, I was sold. My skin looked more balanced, felt more comfortable, and most importantly ‚Äì I wasn't constantly worried about trying new products or dealing with random irritation flare-ups.

# The Texture Game: What You're Actually Putting on Your Face

One thing that really impressed me about this set is how **non-sticky and lightweight** everything feels. You know that gross feeling when you layer on skincare and your face feels like you've been dunked in honey? Yeah, that's not happening here.

The **cleanser** has this perfect balance ‚Äì it lathers enough to feel like it's actually cleaning, but doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped. The **toner** absorbs quickly without any tacky residue. The **serum** is probably my favorite ‚Äì it has this almost water-like consistency that somehow provides serious hydration.

And the **barrier cream**? Chef's kiss. It's rich enough to actually protect your skin barrier but light enough that you won't look like you've been slathered in Vaseline.

# Who Should (And Shouldn't) Try This Set

# Perfect For:

* Anyone with sensitive, easily irritated skin
* People dealing with redness and inflammation
* Those who prefer minimal-ingredient formulations
* K-beauty beginners who want to try a complete routine
* Anyone looking for fragrance-free options

# Maybe Skip If:

* You're looking for dramatic anti-aging results (this is more about skin health than turning back time)
* You prefer heavily fragranced products
* You need super heavy-duty moisturizing (dry skin folks might need something richer)

# The Value Proposition: Is It Worth Your Money?

At **$39.99**, this set definitely isn't the cheapest option out there, but let's break down the math. You're getting six products that would easily cost $80+ if purchased separately. Plus, the sizes are generous enough that this set will last you a solid 2-3 months with regular use.

FYI, I've seen similar gift sets from other K-beauty brands priced at $60-80, so this feels like decent value for the quality and amount of product you're getting.

[Treat your skin (and wallet) to this amazing deal](https://amzn.to/43BkaHL)

# The Science Behind the Calm

What really sets this line apart is the **pH formulation**. All the products are formulated to match your skin's natural pH level (around 5.5), which is crucial for maintaining a healthy skin barrier. When your skin barrier is happy, everything else falls into place ‚Äì less irritation, better hydration retention, and improved overall skin health.

The brand has also completed **non-comedogenicity testing** and **zero-irritation dermatological testing**, which basically means they've done their homework to ensure these products won't clog your pores or cause irritation.

# Real User Experiences (Because Reviews Matter)

I'm not the only one singing praises for this set. Looking at actual user feedback, people consistently mention:

* **Immediate calming effects** on irritated skin
* **Improved skin texture** within weeks
* **No sticky or greasy residue**
* **Perfect for sensitive skin types**
* **Great value for a complete routine**

One user specifically mentioned it helped with their eczema-prone skin, while another said it was their **first successful K-beauty experience**. That's saying something in a market flooded with options.

# How to Actually Use This Stuff

Here's your step-by-step routine (because nobody wants to waste good skincare by using it wrong):

**Morning:**

1. **Cleanser** ‚Äì Gentle circular motions, rinse thoroughly
2. **Toner** ‚Äì Pat onto clean skin (hands work better than cotton pads)
3. **Serum** ‚Äì A few drops, press into skin
4. **Barrier Cream** ‚Äì Thin layer all over
5. Don't forget SPF!

**Evening:**

1. **Cleanser** (double cleanse if you wear makeup)
2. **Toner Pad** ‚Äì Gentle swipes for light exfoliation
3. **Serum** ‚Äì Let it absorb completely
4. **Barrier Cream** ‚Äì Be more generous in the evening
5. **Spot Patches** on any active breakouts

# The Bottom Line: Should You Take the Plunge?

Look, I'm not going to pretend this set will transform you into a glass-skin goddess overnight (sorry, but skincare miracles don't exist :/ ). What it will do is provide your skin with gentle, consistent care that actually respects your skin barrier instead of obliterating it.

If you're tired of playing Russian roulette with your skincare routine, dealing with constant irritation, or just want to try K-beauty without committing to full-size products, this set is honestly a no-brainer.

The **Pyunkang Yul Calming Line Gift Box Set** isn't trying to be everything to everyone ‚Äì and that's exactly why it works so well. It knows what it is (a gentle, effective routine for sensitive skin), and it delivers on that promise without any flashy gimmicks or unrealistic claims.

Your skin deserves products that actually understand what it needs, not just what looks good on Instagram. This set gets it, and chances are, your skin will thank you for finally giving it what it's been asking for all along.

[Ready to give your skin the calm it deserves? Grab the set here](https://amzn.to/43BkaHL)

Trust me, your future self (and your skin) will thank you. And hey, if it doesn't work out? At least you'll have learned something about what your skin doesn't like ‚Äì that's valuable information too!

Here‚Äôs the plot I have in mind‚¨áÔ∏è

Ever since you were little you knew that you wanted to be a famous musician one day and that it was only a matter of time before you made your dreams happen.

You held down odd jobs in highschool but never for long because you knew it's not what you wanted to do with your life.
When you graduated your parents convinced you to go to college and offered to pay for it as long as they saw that you were trying, which you did at first.

You got a job at a local radio station which scratched your itch for musical stimulation for a while. You spent your first year conversing with the callers about whatever music was popular and sometimes getting to play your favorites when the locals weren't calling in any requests. You even started dating a barista at a cafe that was on the same block as the radio station! You really felt content in life for a bit.

As you eased into your second year though you felt that musical itch come back, stronger than ever this time.
You didn't just want to play the same pop songs and listen to the same people call in their opinions day in and day out, you wanted to be a rock and roll star.

You slowly worked towards putting together a tape and sending it out to a bunch of record labels and by the beginning of your third year in college you got a call back from one willing to take a chance. The only problem was that it was one of the few you applied to that would require you to move across the country from your family and partner. Which is exactly why you decided not to tell anyone until the day you packed everything up and dropped out.

On the day you left you hugged your family good bye and had a very tearful goodbye turned break up with your partner. You decided to end things when you felt like they didn't support what they called ""Your irrational, spur of the moment decision"". They had screamed about the life you had planned together and how you couldn't just leave out of nowhere to pursue some wacky dream.
That didn't matter, all that mattered was your chance to rock, which actually went really well.

You sold out stadiums and arenas in the years to come afterwards and became quite the star. After about 10 years that life took a toll on you though and you decided since you had made the mark(and the money) you wanted to make that your next tour would be your last. On the way to your last tour stop you noticed that your next tour location was your hometown! You hadn't visited since you left due to your parents moving closer to you about two years after you moved.

On your first morning there you decided to visit your old work place as well as the coffee shop you remembered
frequenting so much when you were younger. You remembered that place had really good banana bread. You noticed when you and your crew went to order though that the owner was different now than it was then but still familiar somehow? They also didn't seem very fond of you, which was very odd for you to experience. Didn't they know who you were? Most people would kill to have any interaction with you at all. You made it your mission to figure out what their problem was before you leave in 3 weeks to head back home.",0,1749529537.0,roleplaying,0,0.33,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and design of a candle ring wreath hinge on several key features. These encompass the materials used, the diameter and style of the wreath, and any additional adornments it may include. Understanding these features is crucial for making an informed decision and selecting a wreath that meets your specific requirements.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in crafting a candle ring wreath greatly influence its durability,appearance,and overall aesthetic. Wreaths are available in various materials, including natural elements like dried flowers, leaves, and twigs, and also artificial materials like plastic, fabric, and metal. The choice of material frequently enough depends on the desired style and the intended use of the wreath. Natural materials offer a rustic and organic feel, while artificial materials provide greater longevity and resistance to wear and tear.

**Diameter and Candle Compatibility:** One of the most critical aspects of a candle ring wreath is its diameter, both the overall size and the diameter of the central opening for the candle. It's essential to choose a wreath size that complements the size of your candle and the surrounding space. Wreaths come in various diameters, typically ranging from 4 inches to 12 inches or more. Measure your candle's base before purchasing a wreath to ensure a secure and aesthetically pleasing fit. A wreath that is to small may look cramped,while one that is too large may overwhelm the candle.

**Style and Design:** Candle ring wreaths embrace a vast range of styles, from traditional and formal to contemporary and whimsical. Common styles include floral wreaths with delicate blooms, rustic wreaths with natural textures, and minimalist wreaths with clean lines and simple designs. The style of the wreath should harmonize with your existing d√©cor and the overall aesthetic of your space. Consider the color palette, patterns, and materials used in your home when selecting a wreath style.

**Adornments and Embellishments:** Many candle ring wreaths feature additional adornments and embellishments that enhance their visual appeal. These may include berries, pinecones, ribbons, beads, glitter, or other decorative elements. The choice of adornments often depends on the season or occasion for which the wreath is intended.

**Durability and Longevity:** The durability and longevity of a candle ring wreath are important considerations, especially for those intended for long-term use. Wreaths made from high-quality materials and constructed with care are more likely to withstand wear and tear and maintain their appearance over time.Consider the materials used,the construction techniques,and any protective coatings applied to the wreath when assessing its durability. Artificial wreaths are generally more durable and resistant to fading or damage than natural wreaths.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Depending on the materials used, candle ring wreaths may require occasional cleaning and maintenance to keep them looking their best. Wreaths made from artificial materials can often be easily cleaned with a damp cloth, while those made from natural materials may require more delicate handling. Consider the ease of cleaning and maintenance when selecting a wreath, especially if you plan to use it frequently or in a high-traffic area.

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Candle ring wreaths instantly elevate the aesthetic appeal of any candle display.

Whether you choose a floral wreath with vibrant colors or a minimalist wreath with understated charm, a candle ring wreath transforms a simple candle into a sophisticated decorative accent.

**Surface Protection:** Candle ring wreaths provide a layer of protection for surfaces underneath the candle. They prevent wax drips from damaging furniture, tablecloths, or other delicate surfaces. This is especially important when using unattended candles or those prone to splattering wax. The wreath acts as a barrier, catching any stray wax and preventing it from reaching the underlying surface.

**Creating a focal Point:** Candle ring wreaths are excellent for creating a focal point in any room. Whether placed on a mantel, a dining table, or a coffee table, they draw the eye and anchor the surrounding d√©cor. By adding visual interest and depth, they prevent the space from feeling bland or monotonous. This is particularly useful in larger rooms or those with limited decorative accents.

**Adding Warmth and Ambiance:** The soft glow of candlelight, combined with the decorative appeal of a candle ring wreath, creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. The wreath enhances the candle's natural beauty and adds a touch of personality to the space. This is particularly effective in creating a cozy and welcoming ambiance for gatherings, dinner parties, or relaxing evenings at home.

**Versatility and Adaptability:** Candle ring wreaths are incredibly versatile and adaptable to various styles and occasions. They can be easily customized to match your existing d√©cor or to reflect the changing seasons. Whether you prefer a classic floral wreath or a contemporary geometric design,you can find a candle ring wreath that perfectly complements your personal style. They can also be easily switched out to create different looks and moods.

1l7po1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l7po1c/does_he_even_care_about_me/,Does he even care about me?,"I am 19F and I met this guy at university. He‚Äôs Turkish 20M. We really hit it off and everything was AMAZING at first. He‚Äôd take me out, we really connected with eachother and we were each others first intimate partners. In January he pulled away and distanced himself and when I asked him if smth was wrong or if I had done smth wrong he‚Äôd say no. All of a sudden we stopped hanging out, we barely talked and we stopped intimacy. 

In February he started talking to me again every so often. We were simply platonic at this point and just hung out as friends. I still had feelings for him so I made sure to keep a physical distance between us when hanging out so that I could try to minimise those feelings as much as I could. 

By April we were hanging out every day but simply platonic still. In May, he forgot my birthday and a couple days later we hung out. On that day he took me to see his house for the first time and I laid down on his bed for a bit cause I was tired and he laid down next to me and kept inching closer and closer until he kissed me and I kissed him back. I asked him how he felt about me and he just got this really sad look on his face and didn‚Äôt say much. 

Since then we hung out I think three times and all three times he made sure that there was at least two hours where we could just lay on his or my bed and cuddle and just talk.  On the last time we hung out, he told me he was going back to turkey to see his mom and family in general and ofc I was very happy for him. Before he left he told me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to contact him while he was there, we use whatsapp. When he left in noticed that his profile pic was deleted and I couldnt see his bio so I texted him and it did not deliver. I thus concluded that he blocked me. 

When he came back I could see his pfp again and I reached out asking about his trip. It was obvious that he was not well at this time and he seemed very sad to leave his family behind which I completely understand as someone who grew up in Greece and all my family lives there. 

I just got home from hanging out with him. He lived about three hours bussing from me so it took a while to get there and back. We met at a coffee shop and had some coffee. Once we were done he asked what I was going to do now. This question was weird to me cause he was talking about how he had to go to the grocery store just moments ago so I said I‚Äôd go with him and help him out. He was just like oh okay then, even though this is super normal for us. When we got the groceries to his house he again asked me when I was going to leave which I kind of called him out on and asked if he wanted me to leave. He just kinda laughed and made dinner. 

At some point I had chosen a time to leave and was laying in bed waiting for time to pass while he ate dinner and he later joined me. At first he just laid beside me with his back to me but slowly after a long time I ended up with my head on his chest and he was playing with my hair and rubbing mu back. He did not make a move to kiss me at all, he‚Äôd sometimes just turn to me and look at me for a while and then turn his head away again. I ended up kinda falling asleep and missing that specific bus so he searched for more up on his phone and found another time. While we were waiting I asked him what time it was to see if I had to leave and he told me that I had probably missed the bus so it didn‚Äôt matter and he wouldn‚Äôt get me hi phone to check or let me get my own lol. I didn‚Äôt have wifi so I asked him to look at routes again but he told me that I‚Äôd just stay at his house so it‚Äôs okay and it took me asking twice more for him to check. 

It‚Äôs important to note that since he kissed me in May I made moves to become intimate with him but he always turned it down.

Before I left I asked if he blocked me and he said no and didn‚Äôt say anything further. I think this is a lie. I asked if he was sure and he said yeah. I was obviously not in a good mood then and on the way to the bus stop he asked me what was wrong but I said nothing and I didn‚Äôt hug him goodbye as I normally would‚Äôve.

Although we don‚Äôt really talk about religion between us, I‚Äôm orthodox and his family is Muslim although he said many times that he doesn‚Äôt really believe. I think this may play an important part in the relationship we have because he‚Äôs asked me many times if I was religious and looked kinda relieved when I said I wasn‚Äôt really that religious. 

I just really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm stupid and if it‚Äôs obvious he doesn‚Äôt like me. I might‚Äôve forgot some points but this is the main stuff ",1,1749529218.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1l7pne9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l7pne9/question_about_apax_lab_recipes/,Question about Apax Lab recipes,"Hey all! Sorry if this is a bit dumb, but I haven't really been able to find an answer. 

So... Apax Labs has a recipe calculator on their site, and they give you specific drops amounts depending on ml yield and process. However, I'm wondering how this would translate if you only have a single bottle; in my case, Tonik.

For example... they recommend 17 drops of Tonik, 3 drops of Jamm, and 7 drops of Lylac for 450 ml of distilled when brewing a washed coffee. What I'm asking is: should I still put 17 drops of Tonik, or do I need to put in 27 drops of Tonik to make up for the lack of the other profiles?

Sorry... I find Apax's advice regarding single profile dosing to be a bit confusing, and it's been hard to find an answer haha.",1,1749529159.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I spent years curating my image‚Äî  
third-wave coffees at the corner caf√©,  
texts timed like precision tools,  
a steady feed of polished moments.  

You met that man:  
always on time, always composed,  
never revealing the cracks.  

But back home was different:  
cold pizza on the counter,  
laundry waiting its turn,  
me singing off-key into the dark.  

I convinced myself it was love‚Äî  
love for the sleek version you applauded.  
Turns out, you were applauding an act.  

When the late-night calls fell silent,  
and ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù turned into ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù  
I closed the tab on that performance.  

Now, in maturity, I‚Äôm learning this:  
Real connection doesn‚Äôt need a script,  
doesn‚Äôt pause for filters to load.  
It finds you in unguarded hours‚Äî  
spilled coffee, half-spoken truths,  
the simple hum of an honest life.  

I don‚Äôt need an audience‚Äî  
just the freedom to be seen.  
If my unfiltered self feels too much,  
you never loved me‚Äî  
only the image you‚Äôd rehearsed.  

I shelved the highlight reel and let my truth unfold,
No more hiding cracks or doing what I‚Äôm told.

I wear my scars like armor, my laughter like a song,
Each broken piece a verse that‚Äôs made me bold and strong.

I stopped chasing shadows, chasing likes, chasing praise,
And chose to live unfiltered in so many honest ways.

I learned to trust my heartbeat, to honor every tear,
To welcome every sunrise and conquer every fear.

I built a life on open doors, where secrets go to rest,
A place where love can settle deep within my chest.

Then came someone ready‚Äîeyes steady, arms wide‚Äî
Who saw the real me shining, no need to run or hide.

They met my messy mornings, my midnight reverie,
Stood firm through every storm and matched my honesty.

Together we found magic in the simplest of days,
Love born from raw connection, not just filtered displays.

Now trust is our foundation, respect the air we breathe,
A happy ending written in the truths we both believe.",1,1749529135.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
