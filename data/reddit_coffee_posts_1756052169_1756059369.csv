40yo F
5'10""/178cm
SW:  260lbs/118kg
CW:  170lbs/77kh

Health issues: Hashimoto's and thyroid cancer at 18, total thyroidectomy. Hypermobility disorder, osteoarthritis that began in my early 20s, and POTS.

I've struggled with my weight my whole life. Neglect and food insecurity as a child, 90s/00s body toxicity and violent bullying as a teen and young adult, suicide attempts, cocktails of medications that caused me to balloon. 
I've lost lots of weight over the years, yo-yoing more than a Duncan and unable to walk the dog. (Sorry about that one, let me dial it back a bit.) There isn't a diet I didn't try. I recall with particular sentimentality the 3 day diet the army recruiter gave me to pass the tape test. Black coffee and dry toast anyone?

It's important to me to mention these things because even besides actual physiological issues, we as a society have been set up to fail from day one by whoever has something they want us to buy. Ridiculed for any imperfection and now..... Shamed for doing something about it and watching the miracle cure be gatekeepered(?/gatekept?) by judgement and money. (If you haven't watched the South Park special I recommend it.) 

Behold the miracle cure. Sounds how it sounds but for me, took it to the bank! Or rather, gave my whole bank to the compounding companies. And I'd do it again. Actually I need to place an order....

Anyway, the first 30lbs I lost ""the old fashioned way"", which was miserable and very hard on my body. Then I was attacked and suffered a surgical injury and long recovery that set me back. For whatever reason after that I kept gaining it back no matter what I did. I found out I needed another surgery to repair my injury and that's when I ""broke down"" and ""gave up"" and got the medication. 

I've been on tirz since January. Personally, I've had to work just as hard to keep up with my nutrition and exercise. The difference? I don't think about food all the time. I don't have to starve to lose and I don't struggle to stay on track. I don't have cravings I can't control or get hangry and verbally abuse my husband. (He's very grateful for that bit.) I'm putting in the same work any successful person not on medication does, only I can finally do it as easily as they can. 

Thank you to everyone who has been inspirational to me. This is an awesome community. Happy and healthy.

I‚Äôve been hacking away at a side project called [**purveyors.io**](https://www.purveyors.io/). It‚Äôs a platform for home and small-batch coffee roasters that combines:

* **AI roast analytics** ‚Äì upload your Artisan roast logs and get visualizations + insights into consistency, development, etc.
* **Coffee discovery** ‚Äì semantic search like ‚Äúfind me a washed Ethiopian under $8/lb with bright acidity.‚Äù
* **Roast journaling** ‚Äì track beans, roasts, and cupping notes across devices.
* **(Coming soon)** shareable roast profiles so you can post your curves and tasting notes for feedback or bragging rights.

The big idea is to bridge the gap between hobbyist roasting and pro-level tools (Cropster, Artisan+). Most existing software is either too clunky, too expensive, or missing sourcing intelligence.

Right now I‚Äôm trying to get **real feedback and early testers**. My goal is to find out if I‚Äôm building something actually useful (and worth paying for) to serious hobbyists and small roasters.

1mz2u32,https://www.reddit.com/r/generationstation/comments/1mz2u32/do_younger_adults_really_not_care/,Do Younger Adults Really Not Care?,"Recently, I went to my favorite coffee shop to meet a friend.  Besides the fact he and I meet at this same coffee shop every Sunday, I also often work out of this coffee shop several other days of the week working off my laptop. My job is on the software industry, and it allows me to work remote.

Ok, all that is great.   So what?   Why am I telling you this?   Well, I set this stage because every time I come to this coffee shop I am always greeted by a familiar, younger adult employee who takes my order.  Every time he or she asks me what I would like, and every time I order the exact same order.   Every time that employee then proceeds to ask me may name so they can write it on the side of the cup, and every time I give it to them.  No problem.  I get it.  They deal with a lot of customers and can‚Äôt be expected to remember them all.  That‚Äôs not my beef.  

My beef is that I then go to pay, and, sure enough, as is the case in many establishments today, I am presented with the de-facto standard screen of ‚Äúhow much tip do you want to leave?‚Äù   Now, I‚Äôm well aware I am not forced to leave a tip, and usually I almost never do.   Again, so what‚Äôs the problem? 

There really isn‚Äôt one, other than the curiosity I have as to why aren‚Äôt these younger people, who take my order, even somewhat aware that maybe if they showed a little more humanity by remembering my name,  again I‚Äôm in this place at least 4x a week, and/or remembering my order, same order every time, then maybe I‚Äôd be more inclined to leave a tip.  Actually, I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôd be more inclined to leave a tip. It‚Äôs almost as if they don‚Äôt want to make more money and choose instead to simply not give a shit.  That‚Äôs fine, but then remove your tip jar, remove your screen that asks how much of a tip I want to leave, and let‚Äôs just agree that you‚Äôre going to get me my order because that‚Äôs your job, and I‚Äôm going to pay what the cost of my order is, and we are going to leave it at that.  

This can happen with anyone in any generation, but it seems to happen, at least to me, when dealing with adults in their early 20‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs almost as if they think they are entitled to not give a shit but still want/expect a tip.  It‚Äôs so counter productive for them. Not all younger adults are like this, but far too many are, and it‚Äôs a real shame.  ",1,1756058854.0,generationstation,0,1.0,False

IMDb Summary: A Texas cowboy is rescued at sea by a 12-year-old boy. While he waits to return home, he decides to help out his rescuer's family.

Starring James Garner, Vera Miles, Eric Shea, and Robert Culp. 

James Garner was a special kind of guy, and if you asked my Great-Grandmother, he was a not-so-distant relative. I have zero confirmation of this and am not claiming it as true. I will say that he claims to have Cherokee ancestry, and I do as well, though mine is verified. 

Entirely unbeknownst to me, a town away, Zedd was being raised in a household where *Maverick* and *The Rockford Files* were cherished TV. 

Zedd has shared with you all previously that LMZ was also a big James Garner fan, apart and entirely on her own. 

Well after the end of *Maverick* and the same year he started *The Rockford Files*, Garner joined forces with Robert Culp (aka the guy not in the red magic suit on *The Greatest American Hero*) as his competition to bring us this Disney ‚Äúyellow spine* film about a Texan who was shanghaied which brought him to his final destination in Hawaii wrangling and selling native, wild born cattle. 

He also ‚Äúroped‚Äù himself a little woman and a [Keiki](https://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.85/cgi-bin/hdict?d=D7631&l=en&e=d-11000-00---off-0hdict--00-1----0-10-0---0---0direct-10-ED--4--textpukuielbert%2Ctextmamaka-----0-1l--11-en-Zz-1---Zz-1-home-keiki--00-4-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-00-0utfZz-8-00) to boot, with Vera Miles (she‚Äôs so pretty) and Eric Shea rounding out the cast. 

The film was slow in spots and was not always kind in their representation of the Native Hawaiian folk. Surprisingly, it was actually better in this third watch than I recall it being the first (and even second) time around as I knew where to pull in my patience and where to just enjoy the silliness and beautiful Hawaiian scenery. 

I find these ‚Äúyellow spine‚Äù films particularly pleasant in the morning with a fresh, hot cup of coffee and my viewing companion to smile at during the funny parts. 

Sometimes, it‚Äôs just about the familiar and comfortable, and *The Castaway Cowboy* brings that in *both* saddlebags. Yee-haw and ***Movie On***! ",2,1756058846.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False
1mz2twz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsHouse/comments/1mz2twz/shadows_house_question/,Shadows House Question,"What exactly are special morphs? How do they come about, and if they all follow the same trend we have seen so far, why have they not overthrown Lord grandfather?

I might be remembering things wrong, but the first the special morphs are mentioned in the story is when Kate sneaks into the mansion. We see one of the third floor nobles, Sophie I think (the one with the butterfly wings), find a morph that copied a rat and eat it before mentioning it was not a special one/one they are looking. The same comment is later made during Kate's debut, where one of the 3rd floor nobles mentions that none of the pairs appeared to be special.

Flash forward to the current story where Joseph gives us more insight into what a special morph is and also mentions that all the adults on the third floor are considered special morphs.

So far we currently know of only 7 special morphs in the story (Lord Grandfather, Joseph, the other three 3rd floor nobles, Kate, and Maryrose). There seem to be a reoccurring trend between these 7 morphs. The first being aging and sooth proficiency. From Joseph, we learn that special morphs have a higher affinity/control over sooth, as well as slower aging effect post fusion. This explains why Lord Granfather hasn't aged a bit or died in 60+ years. It is important to note that high affinity/control over sooth does not equal strength, as we see in the case of Kate, Maryrose (whose ability is monstrous by the way, but she produces very little sooth), Joseph (who admits that his strength is weak compared to other 3rd floor nobles with more combat type abilities), and Lord Grandfather (whose ability although able to propagate throughout the entire island is a non-combat type and he would probably lose in a 1v1 setting). 

The second is characteristic which is similar to all special morphs so far (this one is less certain as we only have one person that can confirm) is the ability to remember their lives as morphs before they became shadows. Since Maryrose is the only unfused special morph in the story so far, only she is capable of confirming this fact (Kate fused at birth). Maryrose knows she is a special morph due to this fact, as all morphs lose their memories once they awaken as shadows. This is also the reason why she wanted to fight the adults.

And lastly, the third characteristic (which is a speculation in my part) is the inability to maintain a sense of self post fusion. Two of the special morphs we get to interact with as audiences (Kate and Joseph) both go through something similar. They both become unconscious after fusion. But for whatever reason, the morph seems to lose control over the human mind after some time leading to the reawakening and taking over of the humans consciousness. For Kate I guess it took 50 to 60 years, after which she was born. For Joseph, we are not given an exact time frame, but he seems to just suddenly awake and realize that everything has changed. After the human awakens from fusing with a special, they do not seem to not remember what happened while the morph was in control of their body, but they retain the abilities offered to them through fusion. Why does this happen to special morphs but not regular morphs? Both Kate and Joseph experience something similar, so is it possible that the other 3rd floor nobles did too, but they pretend to not remember to not awaken suspicion just like Joseph did? Maryrose never fused with Rosemary, but I suspect something similar would have happened. Where Rosemary would awaken after fusion years later.

Also, with all the comments on debutants not being special, how do the third floor nobles know a morph is special pre-fusion, as the only clear sign of specialness is sooth affinity and slower aging, which are much less obvious/hard to measure before fusion. This makes me think of the way the mansion is set up, and everything make perfect sense now. Adulthood is not the freedom people think. Once a shadow reaches adulthood, they go through a second selection/debut to determine who are the special morphs. This selection is much more passive and so much more obvious now in light of recent chapters that it is crazy we never noticed before. The promotion system in the adult side is the filter system. Have you never wondered why in 80+ years there have only been 4 shadows to ever make it to the 3rd floor? Assuming they debut 6 shadows every 3 months like in the story so far, that would make 1840 shadows in the last 80 years alone. If only 2 make it to adulthood per group, that is still 613 shadows. Way too many for that tiny mansion on the hill. We see some are sent out into the island, but not many. Most adults end up staying at the mansion. We do not encounter many adults in the mansion, so most of them probably just end up dying inside the mansion and get disposed of. We see adults in the series nor afraid to harm or rough each other up to the point of death, so makes sense. So here is what I think. The criteria for promotion from 1st to 2nd floor is strength and sooth control. Which is why we see so many strong shadows (Edward et al) easily get promoted to 2nd floor soon after fusion. But the criteria for promotion to the third floor is age and physical appearance. Have you never wondered why so many of the second floor nobles introduced in the series are so particular about revealing their faces? My idea is that a special morph would not age, so after 20+ years, a second floor noble who already proved their strength would naturally be promoted to 3rd floor if they show signs of not aging, as that would mean they fit both criteria of a special morph, reduced aging effect and higher sooth control/affinity. For this reason shadows on the second floor likely feel touchy about their aging appearance and choose to not reveal their faces. 2nd floor nobles who age normally, and therefore determined to not be special morphs are then sent out to live on the island, as they would blend in much easier that special morphs who do not age.

So far it seems the goal of the selection process is to find or artificially produce special morphs, but how are they going about it? (Question for the thought) 

But going back to special morphs losing control over their hosts post fusion. It now makes sense why Lord Granfather goes through the extra step of using coffee on the children as opposed ot just letting them inhale sooth as he does with the other island members. His ability does not work on Shadows, and by extension would not work on adult humans who fused with shadows. Normally that would not be an issue for regular morphs who get brainwashed through their living dolls. But for special morphs who later lose control over their host post fusion, it would lead to the host breaking free from the influence of his sooth ability, so the only way to keep them under control would be to tamper with their memories. But Joseph who was brainwashed and likely dosed with coffee was freed from the brainwashing regardless and has been trying to stop Lord Granfather from leaving the Island. But what if this is just a huge case of everyone believing everyone is the enemy. I assumed it must have quite startling for someone to be unconscious then awaken to shadow beings calling them Lord Grandfather, as it would be for every other 3rd floor noble. Maybe they all regained consciousness but think everyone else is still brainwashed and so they are just playing games happy family. Because, if Lord Granfather really wished, he could simply ignore Joseph and leave the Island. And I believe all the other 3rd floor nobles would want that if Lord Granfather really wished to do so, unless they are all secretly trying to stop him too. This goes back the comment Edward made a while back about how inactive/incompetent Lord Grandfather and the 3rd floor nobles have been. He thinks the 3rd floor nobles are leading Lord Grandfather astray (which is the whole reason he wants to get rid of them), but I think they all regained their consciousness and are trying to stall for time (including Lord Grandfather) as they all view each other as the enemy trying to ruin the world.

Thanks for reading, and on a side note, it is satisfying to know Edward might never make it to the third floor, as it was pointed out that he has physically aged after the fusion, so he isn't special at all! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Places to check for activities: parks and recreation by city, adult continuing education classes, community theaters, community colleges, some school districts have trips and activities for adults, libraries, and Meet-Up.

Elizabeth and I walked through the same tunnel we had walked through tons of times, now having to pretend that it was just a normal trip back to the island. When we got there, I led her to a little cave on an off part of the island that was stashed behind a waterfall. Inside was a flannel blanket draped over a dry spot of moss tucked away on the left-hand side. I had stolen from the kitchen a package of her favorite snacks and candies that they had grown here. And the only outside food item that they served here was a package of fruit gummies.¬†

‚ÄúSo if respect is all that keeps a knife from his back, then respect is nothing‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, what do you want to do, start a revolution?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we? There are thousands of students and only a couple hundred staff. You could gather up all the staff. Send off a handful of students to go get the police, and then bam, no more school‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWow, you really have thought a lot about this‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you ever thought about getting out of here, seeing your family again?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMy family isn‚Äôt on the best of terms, and besides, who needs family when you have amazing friends and a loving partner?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you want more, don't you want to live a full life, like learning to drive or going to high school?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI mean, you get used to it after a decade‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúJust keep your head down and don‚Äôt step out of line‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDid you ever learn about WW2, Marcus?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, back in the forties, the Germans hated the Jews‚Äù.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know what a jew is, right?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, of course I do‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, back in Germany, they had these concentration camps where they would torture and kill the Jews for fun‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWe are in a concentration camp‚Äù. We talked on the beach there for maybe another fifteen minutes before we heard a rustling in the sand like a low pitter-patter, like the footsteps of a child trying to sneak down stairs to catch Santa.¬†

‚ÄúH-H-Helloooo‚Äù. I said into the empty void. Just then, a small raccoon darted out of the void. Causing me to fall backwards and soaking my arms in the lake water.¬†

‚ÄúHahahah, a what are you scared of, raccoons or something?‚Äù. As she said that, the nightmare I had had of the deformed raccoon reared its putrid head once more.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like raccoons, and at least I‚Äôm not afraid of fish‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúHey, you promised never to bring that up. I told you that in secret‚Äù. We both sat there laughing and kissing each other until we moved back over to the canoe and paddled our way back to shore. To be met by Douggie smoking on the shore, propped up by a rock.¬†

‚ÄúAh, there are the two lovebirds I could hear you two from over here‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúGo jump off a cliff, Douggie‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúHey, what did I say to you two?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúFine, let's go get some dinner‚Äù. Later that night me Douggie and I were talking.¬†

‚ÄúHey, so what are we going to do when we get into our twenties and stuff?‚Äù. He breathed in a huge lungful of smoke, blowing it out into the room.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYou know when it's time to go to college‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI dunno know bro‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúLike if you could choose where you wanted to go in life, man, like if you could get out of here, what would you do?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúProbably somewhere like uhh, Brazil or some place I heard they got some nice babes over there‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, like seriously, what would you want to do with your life, ma?‚Äù.

¬†‚ÄúFirst off, when did you become a philosophical smoker dude, and I dunno like uh Stanford. Yeah, Stanford‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúReally, Stanford, do you think that you could get into Stanford University?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I hear they got a great astronautics program‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanna be an astronaut?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, do you not think I can be an astronaut?‚Äù. He stood up and planted an invisible flag into the earth and said.¬†

‚ÄúTschh, this is Douggie to Houston, we have landed on Mars, one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind‚Äô‚Äù. I burst out laughing and said,¬†

‚ÄúOh my god, you really think that you are going to land on Mars?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, why not? It's not like you could. You know what they say, shoot for the moon so that even if you miss, you‚Äôll land among the stars‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMhhm, sure bud‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúGod, I gotta get to bed, can‚Äôt have Elizabeth finding out I‚Äôm staying up late smoking again, I just got her off my back for catching me that time in the garden‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúOkay, dude, you have your sleep, I‚Äôma stay up a little bit longer. Hey, by the way, what got you all like that? You know all that uhh radical thinking about what life could be like outside of here.¬†

‚ÄúElizabeth told me all about being on the outside and doing all these things‚Äù.¬†¬†

I hated going to bed after a smoke session. The nightmares always came back if I smoked before bed. I always tried to give myself a good hour and a half for it to wear off before bed. But tonight I didn‚Äôt get that luxury. I was standing in the headmasters office everything looked normal but certain things looked off everything was rearranged or maybe mirrored I don‚Äôt know but what I did see disturbed me to my core resting in the corner impaled through the stomach on a stake was Elizabeth here body displayed graphically and grotesquely her blood flowed like a crimson stream down onto the stake which trickled down to a red pool of her blood. I nearly vomited and couldn‚Äôt tell if that also happened in real life or not. I tried to scream, but the only noise that came out was my muffled murmur. Just then, a huge machine sprouted out of the ground and was strapped to it. I watched as the parts moved further and further away. I tried to free myself, but when I did, the metal that held me burst into flames. As I moved to try to escape, a copy of me appeared in front of me with the Headmaster standing next to him. A copy of me was crying profusely as he gripped a knife in his hands. I opened my mouth, but all that came out was a hoarse groan. Jus, the copy of me, plunged the huge knife into my stomach. I could feel the pain surge through my body like a bolt of lightning. I could feel blood gush from my stomach as another groan erupted from my throat. In my skull, it felt like thunder, but the actual noise was barely even audible. The knife was ripped from my chest and pushed back in on the other side. Blood squirted from his wound like a morbid water fountain. I was spluttering with blood like a car stuck in a pile of mud. I spat out mouthful after mouthful of blood from my throat. As the third and final stab pushed into my lung, I felt my whole body go limp, and my head rolled back like a yo-yo. My eyes turned back into my skull. All the wounds went cold, and I was dropped from the machine onto a pile of books. I knew what was going to happen next as the cold liquid hit my body, stinging onto the wounds. I let one final heave of air from my body, symbolizing the last ounce of life extinguishing from my body. Just as I let out the final breath, I felt an immense heat cover my body as the match hit my chest. I awoke from the nightmare with a staggering jolt. I saw a slight twinkle of the sunrise peeking out over the horizon. I walked through the halls to Elizabeth‚Äôs room to wake her up and ask her if she wanted to watch the sunrise with me, but I didn‚Äôt see her in her room. I started panicking, wondering where she had gone. I ran down to the cafeteria to see if she was there and saw her grabbing a cup of coffee next to the food bar. I joined her and grabbed myself a warm cup of tea, as I hated the taste of coffee. To me, it tasted like poison. I can even now recall her usual coffee choice. She always had a coffee with two packets of water and one creamer with a dash of honey. I grabbed my cup of tea and squirted some honey into my cup.¬†

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù.

¬†‚ÄúNo, you‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMe neither‚Äù.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWas it the nightmares again?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo (I lied,) you know I don‚Äôt get those unless I smoke before bed‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWanna join me to watch the sunrise?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúSure, I've got nothing better to do‚Äù. We sat on the front of the steps looking out at the sunrise.¬†

‚ÄúDid you know that right now it looks like how Pluto does during noon?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, where‚Äôd you hear that?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDouggie, he‚Äôs been reading about a lot of planetary facts. He also tells me that Pluto is his favorite planet in the solar system‚Äù. We sat there quietly sipping our coffee and tea, just living in the moment, wrapped up in a soft throw blanket we took from her bed. We sat there with our heads on each other's shoulders. I could hear her gentle breathing, and my whole world was at peace. It was moments like that that made me feel at peace in the world.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, Marcu, that's what's stopping us from running away right now, ow like you know just climbing up those walls and running away to the next town‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúAbout thirteen feet of pure stone and metal‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúBut like what if we just climbed up the walls and ran away?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDouggie. I can‚Äôt leave Douggie here; he would have to come with us‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, if he were here and we just ran away, what would stop us?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. We sat there quietly, breathing in the fresh early morning air.

1mz2rkx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz2rkx,"Zoo park story, 100% complete, great game with some flaw!","This game was so fun! Very short compared to the others. Unlike some, I would not call this the worst game! It has so much fun, because finding the animals, giving them love and all the animations of said animals are so cute!
And you get mythical creatures too. 

Really, the flaw is the game is that it seems unpolished with others. 

Concept is grow your zoo and then what? 

There are 3 achievable goals.
Fill the encyclopedia by finding all the animals and making babies. 
Find all areas and unlock all areas. 
Find all combos. 

The game has achievements  but they are an issue, because instead of being able to fulfill them, like most of these  games, they are incremental, meaning they ask for more and more each time. The problem is that at some point, it starts asking for impossible things because the number is too high or no consideration for space. The rewards are also really, really low. 

10 star rating is supposed to be the top, but it keeps adding stars, forever. 

Then the animals.. First, you can't release nay if your zoo gets full, and they never stop breeding. There is a limit to how big you can make an enclosure, and the upgraded one only has half the space. 

Regardless though, it's a fun game if you enjoy it for the animals stuff, and reach the 3 goals and don't worry about the rest

1mz2r1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/eLearnSecurity/comments/1mz2r1q/got_the_ejpt_after_12h_here_are_my_thoughts/,Got the eJPT after 12h. Here are my thoughts,"https://preview.redd.it/f07f0s19zzkf1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=97b710000e699f8e5c6ade8b96d7e52a89a88bd1

A bit of background. I'm a physicist who switched careers and started in Help Desk almost a year ago. Besides that, I'm studying System Administration and also have Cisco's CCST cybersecurity. On a daily basis, I use technologies from Sophos (certified engineer), Fortinet (soon to start with basic certs), VMware and ocasionally Huawei. I've also completed some of the free courses of Security Blue Team.

  
I started the course with 0 knowledge about pentesting and while the course as a whole is really interesting and does a good job teaching the basics, the labs and CTF were by far the best part. The videos, however, were really boring and sometimes it was hard for me to keep going. Ahmed is a good guy, but his way of teaching is a bit lacking for me. Half of a 20 min video is spent in reading some slides (something I can do on my own) and the other half is enumerating the FTP protocol using MSF as we saw another 3 times. And we have 3 videos about that.

The course is also very here is the thing, this is how it's done. Little to no explanation about the why is given. The aproach is fine for showing how to use a tool, not how to perform manual penetration. I felt that some techniques were not really explained in a way a newbie would understand them and they are expected for the exam. That is a flaw that labs have too, where the solution is mostly a bunch of commands and their output.

Now, about the exam.

The exam was fun and not difficult at all. I completed  it in 12h (I answered all the 35 questions) starting at 10 am and finishing it at 10 pm with a break for lunch and some coffee at 6 pm. I could have finished it 3 or 4h earlier if not for the need to restart the lab enviroment.

Not gonna go into much detail, but the exam is what we were told: we have some machines in a DMZ and some machines in the internal network and we shall perform each and every step of the pentesting and look for the information asked. Everything that I've found on the exam was on the course, so no need to over study with HTB or THM.

While the questions can guide you about how to aproach the exploitation or what to do, seeing the results I feel like the exam is intended for you to exploit the machines in a set way instead of being totally free to do as you feel it. (e.g. a machine is expected to be exploited manually while you can use a MSF module). My thought is that if that's so, either the questions explicitly says so, or the machine is prepared for just allowing that way of exploitation.

As I previously said, I got stuck on a machine trying to get a couple of flags that didn't showed on the target machine. At first I thought it was my way of doing things, but after scalating privileges and gaining persistence with every technique I know about (3-4h later), I tried stopping the lab and startting it again. Boom, the flags appeared. Shit happens sometimes.

Finally, some tips: 

1. Enumareation has been said to be of vital importance. I'm not that convinced about it, given that most of the information I needed came form the initial scan that I performed (-sV -sC was enough). I found more important to get the big picture and organized.

2. Be organized. Read all the questions, write them in your favourite note app and try to organize them by machine. That way, you can have a clearer picture of what to look for on each machine.

3. Have things clear. If you already know what are asked to look for, look for those things and try to see if the ambiguous questions fall under that machine. Anything else is wasting time.

4. Stuck on a machine? Don't know what to do? Look for it on internet. You aren't less for not knowing something and looking for the answers. That's what is done 99% of the time on work (I even use ChatGPT sometimes).

5. Still suck? Take a break, go for another machine and come back later. 

That's everything I can think about. If you have some questions or need some guidance, don't feel shy and ask. I'll try to answer as much as I'm allowed to.",2,1756058668.0,eLearnSecurity,0,1.0,False

Why are there resources like coffee and sugar within the countryside that I can't find when I go to make the free map? 
Second question
Do Industry levels of productivity increase? If so, how? 
Third question
If I need a resource on the other side of the map, why doesn't the plane transport it?

1mz2pve,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1mz2pve/the_great_screenshot_detective_case_of_2025/,The Great Screenshot Detective Case of 2025,"Fellow support warriors, gather 'round for today's episode of ""Why Do Users Hate Us?""

**The Setup:** Monday morning, 9:47 AM. Coffee still brewing. Inbox notification pings. Subject line: ""URGENT!!! Payment broken!!!""

My optimistic brain: *""Maybe they included detailed steps and browser info this time?""*

Reality: A single blurry screenshot that looks like it was taken during an earthquake, showing what might be an error message, or possibly a very abstract piece of modern art.

**The Investigation Begins:** Me: ""Hi! Can you describe what happened when you tried to make the payment?""

User: ""I clicked the button and it didn't work.""

Me: ""Which button specifically? And what error appeared?""

User: ""The payment one. It's broken.""

*Internal screaming intensifies*

**Three Hours Later:** After 12 back-and-forth emails, I finally extract that they're on Safari, iOS 15, trying to checkout, and getting ""some red text."" The screenshot they sent? Turns out it was taken AFTER they refreshed the page, so no error message visible.

**The Plot Twist:** While pulling my hair out during lunch break, I stumbled across this thing called FixRelay AI that supposedly reads screenshots and figures out what's actually broken. My cynical support-hardened heart was skeptical, but my caffeine-fueled desperation was stronger.

**The Demo That Made Me Question Reality:** I uploaded our user's terrible screenshot. This AI thing apparently:

* Detected it was a checkout page (somehow?)
* Identified browser Chrome elements that weren't even clear to human eyes
* Pointed out there was likely a validation error on a form field
* Suggested it was probably a credit card format issue

I went back to the user: ""Are you entering your credit card with spaces or dashes?""

User: ""Oh yeah, I always put dashes. Why?""

**The Resolution:** Fixed in 2 minutes once we knew the actual problem.

**The Realization:** 6 hours of detective work ‚Üí 2 minutes of actual fixing.

What if support tickets came pre-investigated? What if ""payment broken!!!"" became:

* **Issue**: Credit card validation failing on checkout
* **Browser**: Safari 15.1, iOS 15.2
* **Steps to reproduce**: Enter card number with dashes in format xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
* **Error**: ""Please enter valid card number"" (extracted from screenshot)

**The Confession:** I'm now on some waitlist for this AI thing because honestly? If I never have to play screenshot detective again, I might actually enjoy this job.

Anyone else tired of being Sherlock Holmes when they just want to be a problem solver?

Update: For anyone asking, I found it by googling ""AI screenshot bug analysis"" - apparently it's called FixRelay AI and you can join their waitlist at [**https://fixrelay.dev/**](https://fixrelay.dev/). 

No affiliation, just a tired support human who wants fewer ""it's broken"" tickets.

Part Two

The Weight & The Wall

The Gym: Shared Struggle, Earned Respect


The warehouse door looked like it should squeal but it didn‚Äôt. 

It swung open on quiet hinges, and cool air rolled out carrying eucalyptus and old iron. 

Plates were racked neat to the wall; bars gleamed like river steel. 

The floor was chalk-ghosted where hands had learned their limits and then taught them new ones.

Bastien was already there, hoodie unzipped, forearms roped and warm. 

He nodded instead of waving. 
It felt like being let into a chapel.

‚ÄúBen l√†, t‚Äôes venu,‚Äù he said. 
You came.

Kai smiled. 

‚ÄúI said I would.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople say a lot of things,‚Äù Bastien replied, but there was no edge to it. 

‚ÄúShoes off. 
We‚Äôll start light. 
√áa va aller.‚Äù

He moved like a big cat that had decided gentleness would be a better story. 

He set the bar, clipped the collars, tested the spin with one hand. 

When he spoke, it was simple: where to put the feet, how to breathe down the spine, what the ground should feel like when it decided to hold you.

‚ÄúMost guys pull with their face,‚Äù Bastien said, tapping Kai‚Äôs sternum with two fingers. 

‚ÄúRelax here. 
Tighten l√†, in your back. 

Picture the bar like a line to the floor. 

You‚Äôre not fighting it. 
You‚Äôre meeting it. 

C‚Äôest diff√©rent.‚Äù

Kai nodded. 

Sweat was already beading at his temples, not from the weight yet, but from attention. 

Bastien‚Äôs hands were precise on his posture, one palm between shoulder blades, one at the hip, then gone. 

No lingering, no show.

Instruction as care.

The first pull came up ragged. Bastien didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúAgain.‚Äù

Second was better. 

The third became a clean hinge, the plates kissing the rubber when they returned like they were trying to remember manners.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Bastien said, low.
 
‚ÄúWeight tells you when you‚Äôre lying. 

T‚Äôentends? 

That‚Äôs honesty.‚Äù

They moved through sets the way you‚Äôd walk through a house at night, learning where the floorboards complained. 

Rows. 
Presses. 

Something brutal with a sandbag that made Kai laugh mid-curse.

‚ÄúTabarnak,‚Äù Bastien grinned, ‚Äúoui, swear a little. 

It oils the joints.‚Äù

Kai surprised him more than once, not with numbers but with staying. 

When most people got glassy and quit, Kai breathed, set again, listened again. 

He didn‚Äôt peacock. 
He didn‚Äôt rush to the mirror. 

He asked the sort of questions that made Bastien want to answer in full sentences.

Between rounds Bastien pointed at the chalk bowl. 

‚ÄúHands,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúWhite is permission. 
You‚Äôre allowed to grip your life.‚Äù

Kai dipped his hands, dust rose, and it felt like a small rite.

On the last deadlift set, Bastien stepped into spotter distance.

Not touching, just there. 
You could feel the room lean quiet. 

Kai braced, eyes somewhere near his shoelaces, and pulled like he was lifting a door off a hinge he didn‚Äôt need anymore.

When it cleared, Bastien didn‚Äôt yell. 

He just said, ‚ÄúOui,‚Äù like a finish line said yes.

They reracked in sync. 

Kai leaned on the bar, breath high.

‚ÄúMost guys come here to prove something,‚Äù 

Bastien said, rolling his shoulders back until they clicked. 

‚ÄúTo me? 
You‚Äôre just here to breathe. That‚Äôs why I trust you.‚Äù

Kai let the compliment land where praise usually skittered off.
 
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDe rien. 
Drink.‚Äù

He tossed a stainless bottle.

Cold hit Kai‚Äôs palm like a blessing.

They finished with carries. 
The kind of work that makes a person honest without language.

Kai walked the length of the floor and back with a trap bar that wanted to sit down. 

The weight called him a liar, then admitted he wasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù 

Bastien said when they set it down. 

‚ÄúYour feet and the steel agreed. That‚Äôs rare.‚Äù

He clapped once, soft. 

‚ÄúShower‚Äôs.
No singing unless it‚Äôs good.‚Äù

Kai laughed. 

‚ÄúI make no promises.‚Äù

‚ÄúMoi non plus. 
Me neither.""

Steam turned the room into a small rain forest. 

Bastien‚Äôs voice drifted through the hiss, friendly and close.
 
‚ÄúMost men learn to measure their body with shame. 

Hostie‚Ä¶ I wasted years on that scale. 

Pas ici. 
Not here. 

You don‚Äôt owe anyone your skin.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot even myself?‚Äù

Bastien paused. 

Kai could hear the slow adjustment of someone leaning against tile. 

‚ÄúEspecially not yourself. 
Start with curiosity. 
Start with mercy.‚Äù

Water hammered down. 

For a second it was enough to be a body in water, not a myth or a warning.

They dressed slow. 

No hurry, no locker-room meanness. 

Bastien glanced over as Kai pulled on his shirt, eyes careful like a brother checking for limps.

Noticing had become the language.

‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù 

he asked.

‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. 
We‚Äôre buying meat.‚Äù

The weight left their bodies but not their bond; hunger asked the next question.

The Butcher: Community, Memory, Generosity


‚ÄúBloor, west of Ossington,‚Äù Bastien said as they walked, hoodie up against the kind of early-evening wind that thought it was charming. 

‚ÄúLooks like nothing, tastes like history. 

Been goin‚Äô since the dinosaurs had coupons.‚Äù

The bell above the door was too cheery for the city. 

Inside: wood, glass, and the respectful cold of real cold. 

Cuts lay bright and honest in their trays. 

Conversation hummed in three languages. 

Somebody‚Äôs kid pressed a face to the freezer door and left a fog-oval like a tiny weather system.

‚ÄúBastien!‚Äù 
called the man behind the counter. 

Apron flour-dusted, hands clean, eyes bright with recognition. 

He was the age of someone who had worked longer than he‚Äôd planned and made peace with it.

‚ÄúClaude,‚Äù 
Bastien grinned. 

‚ÄúT‚Äôes encore l√†? 
Good. 

My boy needs to learn.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways learning,‚Äù 
Claude said. 

‚ÄúCe jeune-l√†?‚Äù 

He nodded toward Kai. 

‚ÄúHe looks like he listens.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe does,‚Äù 
Bastien said simply. 

The pride in it wasn‚Äôt performative; it was placed.

They stepped to the counter.

Bastien pointed to a ribeye, then to another, then shook his head like he was cancelling a bad idea before it formed.

‚ÄúSee the fat?‚Äù 

he said to Kai, voice dropping into that private register men use when teaching feels like inheritance. 

‚ÄúNot just how much - how it‚Äôs drawn. 

Marbling should look like a map you want to get lost in. 

White that melts is memory. 

If it‚Äôs all in one spot, c‚Äôpas bon; it‚Äôs gonna behave like a diva. 

We need something kind.‚Äù

Claude chuckled. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeight, too,‚Äù 
Bastien continued, lifting a wrapped cut and setting it on Kai‚Äôs palm like a newborn. 

‚ÄúYour hand knows. 
Dense is good, heavy for size - means it‚Äôs not half water. 

Smell,‚Äù 
he said, and Kai leaned in without flinching. 

‚ÄúShould be clean. 
Cold iron, not funk. 
Funk is for jazz, pas pour steak.‚Äù

Kai sifted each cue through his fingers. 

The lesson wasn‚Äôt just meat; it was attention. 

He paused, then said, almost to himself:

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ meat‚Äôs like people. 
The lines matter more when they‚Äôre spread out, not hoarded in one place.‚Äù

Bastien blinked, then barked a laugh. 

‚ÄúHostie. 
Maybe I should let you teach.‚Äù

Claude grinned, nodding approval.

They picked two. 

Claude wrapped them like gifts, brown paper whispering under twine. 

He added a small bag of suet, ‚Äúfor the pan,‚Äù and a grin that knew he was spoiling them.

While Claude rang it up, Bastien leaned on the counter, lowering his voice for Kai‚Äôs ear.

‚ÄúYou know why I come here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause the fat is kind?‚Äù 

Kai offered, a half-smile rising.

‚ÄúTabarnak, yes. But aussi - because when Claude‚Äôs uncle won big years back, he gave away chicken legs all day.

Twenty thousand kilos, like a miracle at a d√©panneur. 

Familles lined down the block. He said, ‚ÄòEat. 

Remember me for that, not the ticket.‚Äô ‚Äù

Claude overheard, shook his head with a soft laugh, and corrected gently:

‚ÄúPas mon oncle, Bastien. 
C‚Äô√©tait mon p√®re, actually.‚Äù

Bastien smirked, unbothered.

 ‚ÄúVoil√†. 

See? 
Even better. 
He gave with both hands.‚Äù

Claude waved a hand like he didn‚Äôt want the story but loved it anyway. 

‚ÄúWe still do the giveaway every December. 

Smaller now. 

But‚Ä¶ tradition.‚Äù

Bastien turned to Kai. 

‚ÄúStrongest people I know give like that. 

The kind of wealth that fills a table, pas juste a bank account.‚Äù

Claude slid the parcel across.
 
‚ÄúFor your friend,‚Äù he said, tapping the paper where he‚Äôd written K in thick marker. 

The letter looked like it belonged there. 

‚ÄúFirst cut from here is luck.‚Äù

‚ÄúMerci,‚Äù 
Kai said, meaning it.

‚ÄúEat with someone,‚Äù 
Claude replied. 

‚ÄúIt tastes better.‚Äù

Back on the sidewalk, the paper bag warmed Bastien‚Äôs forearm.

He bumped Kai‚Äôs shoulder with it. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre carrying history,‚Äù 
he said, mock solemn. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drop.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to be worthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood answer.‚Äù

They passed a bus stop where three teenagers argued about shoes as if it were a matter of national security. 

A woman in a yellow coat balanced a cake box the way some people hold a sleeping cat.

The city was a thousand kitchens. 

Bastien looked gladdened by all of them.

‚ÄúAt my place,‚Äù 
he said. 

‚ÄúWe cook. 
I talk too much. 

You laugh at me because you‚Äôre polite.

 We eat. Deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd, mon p‚Äôtit fr√®re?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou pick the music. 

Chez nous, guest chooses le son.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways. 

Teach me what silence owes you.‚Äù

They carried more than meat up to the condo - something warm and wordless that wanted feeding too.



‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã



The Pan: Ritual as Brotherhood


Bastien‚Äôs condo thought it was bigger than it was and somehow got away with it. 

Plants leaned against the window as if they owned the view. 

A couch slouched like it forgave you for everything. 

The frying pan was black from years of use, slick like a vinyl record that had never skipped.

He laid the steaks out and let them breathe.

‚ÄúFirst rule,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúroom temperature. 

Cold steak screams in a hot pan and panics. 

We don‚Äôt cook panic.‚Äù

Kai laughed. 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt cook panic.‚Äù

‚ÄúSalt like you mean it,‚Äù Bastien continued. 

He pinched from high so it rained proper. 

‚ÄúPepper after. 
Oil the pan, not the meat. 
We‚Äôre not lubricating a r√©sum√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that a Quebec proverb?‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äôest Bastien proverb. 
Write it down.‚Äù

Kai washed his hands, dried them, and stood without asking where to be. 

Bastien handed him the tongs like a baton.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on turns.‚Äù

Butter slid into the oil, followed by a clove of garlic smashed flat and a sprig of thyme that perfumed the air like memory.
 
The meat kissed the pan with that sound that makes people believe in God again. 

Bastien tilted, basted, and smirked at his own blasphemy.

They worked without stepping on each other. 

When Bastien reached, Kai moved. 

When Kai needed space, Bastien made it. 

It became, quickly, a dance of competence instead of a fight for choreography.

‚ÄúDumpling law applies,‚Äù 
Bastien said as they set the steaks to rest. 

‚ÄúYou rush, you burn your tongue and your feelings. 

You wait too long, someone takes the last one. 

Pace the joy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs scripture,‚Äù 
Kai said.

‚ÄúHostie, oui.‚Äù

They ate with their elbows leaning on the counter, knives honest in their hands. 

Juices ran, and a holy quiet settled, the kind where sound would feel like disrespect.

Kai made a face on the third bite that wasn‚Äôt about pleasure exactly. 

It was something older. 
It said I have been hungry in places I didn‚Äôt know had mouths.

Bastien saw it and softened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good,‚Äù he said, not as a question. 

‚ÄúI got more if you want more and I will not judge you for the catastrophe you‚Äôre about to do.‚Äù

Kai laughed, back of his hand to his mouth.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that. 
You‚Äôll make me shy from steak.‚Äù

‚ÄúImpossible.‚Äù

They finished with a small salad because Bastien insisted balance was not a rumor. 

When the plates were put away, he leaned back and patted his stomach like a cartoon.

‚ÄúMon dieu. 
See?

 You eat together, you remember each other.

 Always.‚Äù

Kai nodded, eyes a little far off in the best way. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to steal that.‚Äù

‚ÄúPas voler,‚Äù 
Bastien said. 

‚ÄúBorrow. 
Bring it back with a story.‚Äù

They washed up like people raised right, water running, the easy choreography of passing plates, the simple goodness of a towel in a hand that wanted to be useful.

When the lights dimmed themselves and the city showed up in the glass, Bastien flicked on the TV, something animated and ridiculous, and tossed a hoodie at Kai that smelled like cedar, laundry, and the kind of cologne humble enough to work.

‚ÄúWear,‚Äù 
he said. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of the ritual.‚Äù

Kai pulled it on. 

The cotton fell like a second skin. 

He exhaled with his whole back.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúBon.‚Äù

The steak was gone, but the silence between them kept cooking.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óè


Stillness: Vulnerability Without Demand



They didn‚Äôt talk at first. 

The anime did the talking badly and that was somehow perfect.

Bastien sprawled with the exhausted dignity of a giant who had lifted whatever the day had asked and then some. 

Kai sat smaller than he was willing to be in most rooms, knees up, sleeves tugged over his hands until only his fingers showed. 

The hoodie‚Äôs zipper caught the streetlight like a tiny lighthouse.

‚ÄúStillness used to make me itchy,‚Äù 

Bastien said finally, not at the TV, not at nothing. 

‚ÄúComme des fourmis dans les os. 

Ants in the bones. 

When I stopped moving, all the stuff I outran caught up and asked for tea.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat changed?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomebody sat with me once. 
Didn‚Äôt ask a thousand questions.

Didn‚Äôt try to fix. 

Just‚Ä¶ was a wall. 

And walls,‚Äù 
he said, looking over now, 
‚Äúare holy when you need to lean.‚Äù

Kai swallowed. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do that without thinking about how I look doing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMoi non plus, before. 

But the trick? 

Think about the person who built your wall, not your face against it. 

Gratitude is heavier than shame.
Pushes back better.‚Äù

Kai said ‚Äúhuh‚Äù like a prayer.

They let the loud cartoon carry the seriousness away like a bus that always arrives right when you need it. 

At some point Kai‚Äôs shoulder found Bastien‚Äôs bicep. 

It was a test and a surrender, both.

‚ÄúYou good there?‚Äù 

Bastien murmured.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù Bastien said automatically. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not carrying you.‚Äù

‚Äúyou always say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDebatable.‚Äù

A commercial yelled about phones in French for no reason. Bastien chuckled. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being marketed to,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt must be love.‚Äù

Kai looked at him then, a longer look than earlier. 

It said I am learning the shape of safety and your outline is involved. 

He didn‚Äôt say it out loud. 
He didn‚Äôt need to.

When the credits rolled on nothing, they muted the world and listened to the hum of the building. 

Someone upstairs laughed. 

A kettle sang somewhere on the floor. 

The city breathed like a big animal that had decided not to bite.

‚ÄúMerci,‚Äù 
Kai said into the hoodie. 

For the meat. 
For the gym. 

For the unasked-for tenderness that didn‚Äôt want to be named because naming would make it smaller.

‚ÄúDe rien,‚Äù 
Bastien said. 

‚ÄúM‚Äôen sacre des stories. 
You don‚Äôt owe me the why.
 Just sit.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

The couch became a small country. 

Citizenship required only breath.

They dozed.

Stillness settled like a second skin. 

But sleep is where walls thin.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã


The Second Night: Jumbled Fire, Three Voices, Fortress


It happened fast this time, not the screaming kind of nightmare, not the fall, not the teeth. 

It came like a flood of radio stations in a valley where mountains refused to speak one at a time.

Kai‚Äôs dream filled with gold figures again, but closer. 

Not statues, not saints. 

Moving. 

The tallest two turned their heads as if checking wind; the nearer, the broad one with the braided hair and the winter eyes, stepped forward. 

Eight feet of quiet thunder.

Behind them, a crowd of ghost-bright faces pulsed in and out, as if memory itself were breathing.

Three voices layered - one gravel, one river, one the hiss of pine in winter. 

They spoke over each other, verbs colliding in the doorway of his chest. 

Hold. 
Run. 

Remember. 

Lift. 
Kneel. 
Strike. 

Forgive.

Kai reached for one and caught three. 

His hands came up in the real world. 

The hoodie twisted. 
Breath stacked wrong.

From the other end of the couch, Bastien woke like a soldier who had learned gentleness late. 

One eye, then both. 

He didn‚Äôt swear at first this time.
He didn‚Äôt make light. 

He just sat up and opened his arm the way you open a door for someone carrying too much.

‚ÄúViens,‚Äù 
he said. 
Come.

Kai moved like someone underwater who had found a rope. 

Bastien hauled him in against his chest, big palm finding the back of Kai‚Äôs head, the other arm around his shoulders with the exact pressure that says I am here and I am not moving.

‚ÄúBreathe with me,‚Äù 
Bastien murmured. 

‚ÄúComme √ßa. 
In, out. 
Count the ribs. 

One‚Äîdeux‚Äîtrois. 

Good. Encore.‚Äù

The room took obedience from his voice. 

The city agreed to hush.

Kai‚Äôs breath fought, then listened, then followed. 

The dream still pressed at the edges, gold and clang and smoke, but the core of it narrowed. 

He recognized it now: 
three, always three.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just noise,‚Äù 
Bastien said softly, as if he knew the architecture of it. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll tune it later. 
T‚Äôes ici.‚Äù 

You‚Äôre here.

He pulled the hood up over Kai‚Äôs head like a tent. 

‚ÄúPas sous mon toit. 
Nothing gets to you. 
Not under my roof.‚Äù

The line hit like water in a desert.

Kai made a small sound that would have embarrassed him in daylight. 

Bastien didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúTell me one thing,‚Äù 
Bastien said after a minute when the worst had passed. 

‚ÄúJust one. 
Pas plus.‚Äù

Kai found a word by feeling for its temperature. 

‚ÄúThree,‚Äù he whispered. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ three.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Bastien said, accepting without asking for the rest.

‚ÄúThen we fold three into a blanket and we sleep. 

We can give them better chairs tomorrow.‚Äù

He smoothed Kai‚Äôs hair like a brother who remembered how to calm a kid when thunder showed off.

Silence ripened. 
Breath slowed. 

The gold figures stepped back inside the dream, not gone, just willing to wait at the edge like sentries who had been reminded that doors can close when they must.

Bastien exhaled, not realizing he spoke until he heard himself.

‚ÄúEven the strongest need a wall,‚Äù he murmured into Kai‚Äôs hair. 

A pause, then softer still, like it slipped out without permission:

‚ÄúCe soir‚Ä¶ sois le mien.‚Äù 
Tonight‚Ä¶ be mine.

It wasn‚Äôt a command, wasn‚Äôt romance. 

It was the sound of a fortress making room.

Kai nodded against him. 

The assent was a body thing, not a sentence.

They stayed like that until the room admitted morning without permission. 

Pale light was kind to them, making less of their edges and more of their outline. 

Bastien‚Äôs arm had fallen asleep but he didn‚Äôt move it. 

He would take pins and needles over distance.

When Kai blinked up from under the hood, he found he was still being held. 

He found he hadn‚Äôt broken anything. 

He found the world unchanged and also not.

‚ÄúTu vois?‚Äù 
Bastien said, voice rasped by sleep. 

‚ÄúTwo times, still here. 
We‚Äôll do ten if we need. 
I got time.‚Äù

Kai swallowed the sudden salt in his throat. 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äôest correct.‚Äù

They detangled like careful people, slow, making sure the removal didn‚Äôt feel like a loss.

Bastien stood and stretched, the building‚Äôs bones cracking in sympathy.

‚ÄúCoffee,‚Äù 
he said, ‚Äúand then we lift something small. 

Habit is a rope. 
We hold it.‚Äù

Kai nodded. 

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

He watched Bastien move to the kitchen and thought of the butcher‚Äôs paper, of Claude‚Äôs hands, of the chalk bowl. 

He thought of the three not as invaders now but as uncles in a house too small for all their advice. 

And he thought of Jaxx without knowing he was thinking of Jaxx; the shape of a doorway that hadn‚Äôt been built yet, and the bravery it would ask.

Bastien set a mug in front of him. 

The steam curled up like a whisper. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone, mon p‚Äôtit fr√®re,‚Äù he said, not checking if the words would land. 

‚ÄúChez nous, this is how we do it.
We eat, we sweat, we sit, we breathe. 

Repeat. 

That‚Äôs the work.‚Äù

Kai wrapped both hands around the heat and let it convince his fingers.

‚ÄúI can do that,‚Äù 
he said.

‚ÄúOui.‚Äù 

Bastien smiled. 

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

They drank. 

Somewhere in the building, a shower ran, a kettle sang, a kid thumped a ball against a wall and was told gently to stop.

The day broke open like bread.


In a city too wide for one heart, Kai found weight that told the truth and a wall that would not fall. 

What began as chance became covenant.




The End üõë

I am going to join the MSc. AI and ML program in October at TU Darmstadt, and I am searching for an accommodation in Darmstadt from October.

              IF ANYONE HAS ANY LEADS, I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP! I have already applied on WG-Gesucht and the studierendenwerk. (DOES IMMOSCOUT HAVE LESS NO. OF LISTINGS GENERALLY?)
        
        In case you are searching for a flatmate, here is something about me-

        I‚Äôve recently been accepted into the MSc in AI & ML program at TU Darmstadt. So yes, I‚Äôm a bit of a technical person (engineer alert üö®) ‚Äî if that matters in any way.

        Outside the world of algorithms, I‚Äôm really into music ‚Äî especially global music. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not the kind of person who blasts bass-heavy speakers at 2 a.m. I prefer enjoying it peacefully in my own space (earphones are my best friends). I also am often appreciated for my singing, and can jam up with people around if they would wantüòÑ. I am a non-smoker, and in case anyone smokes, I would appreciate if the smell does not reach me. However, the smell of coffee is what I adore, and I love to brew a fresh cupüòä.

        I can cook for myself, and I really appreciate a clean, organized place ‚Äî bathrooms in particular. Sports intrigue me in general, but cricket holds a special place in my heart (a reminder that I am an Indian).

One thing I‚Äôve noticed about Rena is her tone when she speaks to others and when she holds a conversation with Aryan or Gizele. She goes all sweet and nice towards them and is harsh and rude towards others. She gives a cheeky smile just to irk the person on the other end.

I‚Äôve been wearing a rudraksha mala around my neck for years (initially because I thought it was cool and also because I saw family members wearing it). Later I understood its significance. Over time, due to wear and tear, it broke.

Now I‚Äôm planning to buy and wear a Tulsi kanthi mala (double round). I already follow a strict vegetarian lifestyle with no meat, alcohol, smoking, onion or garlic, and I‚Äôm aware of most of the general rules associated with it.

However, I recently came across a point saying that while wearing Tulsi mala you should also avoid tea and coffee. I have asked at ISKCON, a local temple, and some pandits as well, but none of them gave a clear answer. Some say it‚Äôs strictly prohibited, others say it doesn‚Äôt matter.

So is drinking tea and coffee really against the rules of wearing Tulsi kanthi mala, or is it more of a personal or recommended practice?

I am going to join the MSc. AI and ML program in October at TU Darmstadt, and I am searching for an accommodation in Darmstadt from October.
              IF ANYONE HAS ANY LEADS, I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP!
        I have already applied on WG-Gesucht and the studierendenwerk. (DOES IMMOSCOUT HAVE LESS NO. OF LISTINGS GENERALLY?)
                In case you are searching for a flatmate, here is something about me-         I‚Äôve recently been accepted into the MSc in AI & ML program at TU Darmstadt. So yes, I‚Äôm a bit of a technical person (engineer alert üö®) ‚Äî if that matters in any way.

        Outside the world of algorithms, I‚Äôm really into music ‚Äî especially global music. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not the kind of person who blasts bass-heavy speakers at 2 a.m. I prefer enjoying it peacefully in my own space (earphones are my best friends). I also am often appreciated for my singing, and can jam up with people around if they would wantüòÑ. I am a non-smoker, and in case anyone smokes, I would appreciate if the smell does not reach me. However, the smell of coffee is what I adore, and I love to brew a fresh cupüòä.

        I can cook for myself, and I really appreciate a clean, organized place ‚Äî bathrooms in particular. Sports intrigue me in general, but cricket holds a special place in my heart (a reminder that I am an Indian).

        Rent won‚Äôt be a problem. Like most students, I come with the magical ‚Äúblocked account.‚Äù

After a short while he left, again, we didnt talk after that, that day i was very, very excited i dont know why because i knew i wasnt going to see him, days go by and i forget about him partially, thats kind of because i tried to and wanted to forget him, its because we are kinda at the same friend group and i dont want to ruin things for myself and my friends by telling them i had a crush on him and also i had a really important exam at the end of the june so... i succeeded partially, but we didnt see each other till this friday, the same friend's birthday again, he is doing an internship so he was a little late, i was a little excited whole week till that day, he greeted everyone then greeted me, he hugged everyone but i was so excited i didnt know what to do, i shake his hand instead, then devastated about it because he seemed surprised about why i didnt hug him for a second, we were at a yacht, he was giving little infos about ships and sea itself, and I JUST DO THIS SO MUCH AND HE DOES IT TOO AND I WAS COMPLETELY GONE, then they played the music, it was not a slow song, everyone was jumping and stuff and i didnt knew the song so i was sitting, and the same friend's sister too, he came and started to jumping with her, then came to me and leaned his hand, i hold it and we danced and jumped together, i swear that was the best moment ive had in my life since like 4 years. after the yacht, one of my friends told him if he wants to go to eat something and he said ok, but then he left, and we were going to meet (as a group) this saturday but he said he will be out of town, i dont want to wait till april to see him, best chance btw, my heart beats faster since the day i saw him and i cant stop myself, i feel relaxed by seeing the pictures we took at the yacht, he is in my dreams since friday, i dont even follow his ig, just wanted to tell somewhere thank you for reading, i wanted to talk to him so much but i was too excited also my friends are completely against these stuff in the friend group",1,1756058185.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

Would it be stupid to bring a packable duffel bag and flattened box in my backpack? Then buy those inflatable wine protectors to protect the items, which would go in the box (with other packing material), which would go in the duffel bag so I could check the bag?

Obviously a suitcase would protect any glass items better, but I am not about to drag a suitcase around. I also know my backpack would also probably protect the items better, but if my bag goes missing, I'd rather it be a bag I don't care about with food than my good backpack with things I care about in it.

while im the one who ended this friendship accepted that it is what‚Äôs best for me! i think thats the issue. All the past friendships that‚Äôs ended THEY ended it! this is the first time ive ended a friendship! it was very abrupt and i basically ghosted her‚Ä¶. i know that‚Äôs not the healthiest route but for the way this person is‚Ä¶ i knew i couldn‚Äôt have a sit down talk and express how they are being us effecting myself and others due to realizing they never see themself at fault! 

what she did changed the way i look at friendships entirely. it changed the way i go about making new friends since and led me down a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust anyone‚Äù path i feel as if i now don‚Äôt truly know anyone who i am still friends with ‚Ä¶. i feel any new friends i hide myself‚Ä¶ ive turned very private, secluding myself as a way to protect myself & peace. after i distanced myself and cut off this friend it changed me a lot truly‚Ä¶ i stopped posting on social media when ive always had a big social footprint! 

i also use to but now longer do! would snoop on her socials since i cut her off she doesn‚Äôt seem to even care. she never reached out and asked me why? or what happened? if something was wrong, no checking in on me at all. but I know that she wonders why because I‚Äôve heard from other people who also know her that she has been running around saying that I hate her‚Ä¶. That I ditched her and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why. But she‚Äôs a very confrontational person and she‚Äôs never reached out to me like I said so I feel that shows that she didn‚Äôt really ever care about my friendship to begin with!! 

when i was in the process of cutting her off she would text me only to gossip about others and i when i wouldn‚Äôt talk badly on the person but give her a positive viewpoint‚Ä¶ she would leave me on read. or she would ask me to come get coffee with her but then when I would say yes, she would just go by herself or with someone else a week later instead of touching base again on the plan that she attempted to make with me ? BUT even tho i no longer lurk on her socials i hated how it seemed she just moved on, made new friends‚Ä¶ to see that I really didn‚Äôt mean much to her.

1mz294h,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1mz294h/should_i_go_no_contact_with_my_sister/,Should I go no contact with my sister?,"Hi I would greatly appreciate advice on some family drama going on right now.

Some context for the situation I (24F) got married to my partner (enby 26) at the beginning of the year. My oldest sister, lets call Aliyah (32F), told me she would not be attending, because she believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. I knew that Aliyah was religious and we do not discuss politics with her because her and her husband are very conservative (think anti-vax). However, since my partner and I got together almost 3 years before hand I thought she had come around to the idea of us being together. I was in for a shock when she let me know that she was not going to be supportive of one of her sisters and come to our wedding ceremony. I let her know that I did not support her and her husband being together and I still attended her wedding. Regardless of your religious or political beliefs I would have thought that you show up for family. 

This is all pre context for the situation we found out about a couple months later. My Younger sister, Peyton (22F) got coffee with Aliyah to discuss the wedding and me being hurt about it. While they were catching up Aliyah had mentioned something about her husband being in Jail when he was 15. He is 38 now (catch the age gap between him and Aliyah?) We had previously known that when he was a teenager he had been arrested or charged with a couple things, but I thought they were smaller things like theft or something along those lines. Well we find out that it was actually for Molestation. Finding this information out was unfortunately not shocking, but still threw us for a loop. We were around him as kids. My sister Aliyah met him when she was 16 and he was 22. My younger sister and I being 7 and 9. Obviously, we felt extremely uncomfortable that our parents never sat down with us to let us know in an age appropriate way to be weary of him, or even years later telling us the truth. By middle school I would 100% known what a predator was. 

Aliyah 100% believes he did not do this crime and that he apparently took the plea deal to get less time. He only actually served a year in Jail and was on the sex offender list for around 10 years after, because he was a minor when the crime happened. I don‚Äôt believe he followed proper protocol for this (he was around kids a lot at our neighborhood pool during those 10 years of being on the sex offender list.) We are very aware that her views on this might be skewed, because she was literally being groomed by this man at the age of 16. She found this out not long after they got together. After finding out about this, my sisters all had conversations with my parents, where they apologized for not ever talking to us about this. (They have a tendency to avoid most conflict and don‚Äôt talk about a lot of things) They were not able to give us a straight answer on what they believed happened or not. All of my siblings excluding Aliyah have decided that we believe that he probably did what he was charged for. I was already low contact with Aliyah for her views and her decision not to come to my wedding and I think I want to go no contact.

I have had multiple conversations with Aliyah and my parents that my partner and I will most likely not go to family events that Aliyah and her husband will also be at. Aliyah didn‚Äôt take this well, because she thought that he was going to be uninvited to family events. I know that my parents would never intentionally uninvite him and I wouldn‚Äôt ask them to do that. I know Aliyah is also their daughter so I can‚Äôt expect them to feel the same way my sisters and I do about the situation. 

What completely sucks is that Aliyah and her husband have 3 kids together and I adore my niece and nephews. I know going no contact completely would also mean no contact with the kids and I hate that. It‚Äôs not their fault that their dad is the way that he is. (He also has said multiple racist and ableist things, while having a son who is on the spectrum. And is super misogynistic while talking down to us whenever we disagree with something he says.) So my question is: Is there a way to go about this- family functions or other things so we can still see the kids and not their parents? I feel extremely lost here and I thought some outside opinions would really help! Has anyone been in a situation like this where they went no contact with someone who indirectly affected your contact with someone else?

Also I know many people will recommend therapy. I am in therapy currently and have talked about the situation. Not sure if family therapy could be an option or if that would even go well?

I'm a 35F, married with toddler twins. I'm looking for others to write to. Initially we can chat on Reddit, and then move to email if we click. I do miss the days of snail mail so we may get to that stage, but we warned I have terrible handwriting and also I live in the Southern Hemisphere so postage costs might be tricky üòÇ. 

I have a preference for women penpals because I find that men tend to want something sexual or inappropriate. I am not here for that. So if you are a guy and want to write, please be pure in your intentions.

I don't really mind age, so much as life stage. You don't need to be a parent, just understand that me being a parent does influence my views on life. I am pretty settled into a relatively quiet life filled with family commitments and work. I do love writing though and I am a (bad) poet. Words have always been a passion of mine. The idea is that our correspondence would be longer but also at a slower pace.  

I enjoy talking about your life, learning about your day-to-day and having a laugh. People sometimes comment on my dark sense of humour. My interests are mostly going to the gym, drinking coffee, reading, podcasts, thrifting and crochet.

1mz28z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1mz28z0/one_year_anniversary_of_cico_down_38_pounds/,One year anniversary of CICO! Down 38 pounds.,"tl;dr - I lost 38 pounds in a year and go into detail of how.

Having researched what CICO was last year, I decided I wanted to gain control of my health again. I was in the morbidly obese category for years. There's tons of misinformation out there online about how to lose weight, and I feel like tons of people just get lost in it.

I'm 36 years old, male, 5'10"", and weighed 228 pounds to start with. CICO turned out to be a simple answer to the problem - though not always easy to implement! I never used a food scale, but tended to lean on the side of something counting as more rather than less if I had to guess at anything. MyFitnessPal has been a godsend for this, as I've tracked everything there.

It was so relieving the day I checked the scale and the notch was below the 200 mark. I thought I'd never get to that point. Now I'm no longer morbidly obese, and I want to drop another 20-30 pounds. I tracked every day in my Excel spreadsheet, and I had an average calorie count of 1830 per day by the end of 1 year. I feel like I went too high for average calories and could have done better, but I also don't want to be too hard on myself either. The changes are subtle, and I lost an average of 1 pound a week, sometimes 0.5 pounds a week. I don't have a double chin anymore. I can feel my bones now. It's a strange thing to write out, but trust me, it makes sense why I'm happy about that to me.

Don't be hard on yourself when you're doing this. I had entire weeks where I know I ate at my maintenance or even slightly above, but since you're tracking everything - honestly tracking - you will keep yourself in check, even if you have some bad days.

Some food and drink I wanted to give a good shout-out to during the year:

Orville Redenbacher Low-Fat Popcorn. These replaced chips for me entirely, which are much more annoying to track. Pretty low calorie count and high fiber. In general, one hidden convenience of CICO is just how irritating it is to track certain types of foods, so I just avoid them on principle. I aint counting 25 chips at a time, my dudes.

Eggs: They rule, no question.

Coffee Kpods: I gained a new appreciation for drinking coffee black after starting this, oddly enough.

Pepsi Max: Tastes just like actual Pepsi to me, 0 calories, and has enough caffeine to keep me awake.

Turkey Burgers: 200 calories a patty and the ones around here are pretty high in protein. With burgers in general, I'd have days where I'd just eat them without the patties if it meant not going over my daily calorie count.

Hot Sauce and Mustard: 0 calories with the right kind. Put it on everything. Hot sauce on eggs is a real treat.

Baked Potatoes: So good. Look for sweet potatoes too if you like them.

If I can manage to lose this, I assure you anyone can manage it outside of medical reasons. I'm probably the least-prepared person on the subreddit for this, so I know you can do it too.

One real struggle the weight loss has caused me? I needed to get new clothes. And I'll need new ones again next year. What an annoyance!",16,1756057563.0,CICO,1,0.94,False

I‚Äôm sorry for how long this will be, but I feel like if I don‚Äôt write it all down, exactly as it happened, I‚Äôm going to shatter into a million pieces. My husband, Thomas, is a good man, a kind man, and he‚Äôs trying to help, but his help feels like a cage. He looks at me with this deep, sorrowful pity in his eyes, and it‚Äôs a look that says, ‚ÄúMy poor wife has broken.‚Äù He‚Äôs scheduling appointments with doctors whose names I don‚Äôt want to know. I can‚Äôt talk to my mother or my sister, because the moment the words leave my mouth, I know what will happen. The concerned silence on the other end of the phone, the gentle suggestions, the hushed conversations with Thomas behind my back.

How do you tell the people you love that you‚Äôre afraid of your own child? How do you say, ‚ÄúI think my son isn‚Äôt my son anymore,‚Äù and not have them take him from you and put you somewhere soft and white?

So I‚Äôm writing to you, strangers. Because you‚Äôre all I have left. Please, just read it.

Before, our life was‚Ä¶ real. It was messy and loud and exhausting and so deeply, achingly beautiful. Our son, Leo, had turned six in the spring. He was a force of nature, a small human hurricane. He was left-handed, a trait he got from my father, and his little fist would curl so tightly around his crayons that his knuckles would turn white. His homework papers were always a mess of graphite smudges, a testament to his effort. He was obsessed with dinosaurs, a walking encyclopedia of the Cretaceous period. He could pronounce ‚ÄúParasaurolophus‚Äù with the crisp authority of a paleontologist but still, without fail, called spaghetti ‚Äúpasghetti.‚Äù

He was a terrible sleeper. He fought it every night as if it were a mortal enemy, and most mornings we‚Äôd wake up with him wedged between us, a warm, sharp-elbowed little furnace, his feet inevitably planted in Thomas‚Äôs back. I used to complain about it. I‚Äôd stumble into the kitchen, bleary-eyed, and mutter about never getting a full night‚Äôs sleep. God, what I would give to be woken up by one of his bony knees in my spine right now.

His world was built on a foundation of intense, specific loves. He loved his stuffed bear, Barnaby, a threadbare creature with one remaining button eye and fur matted with years of tears, drool, and affection. He loved pancakes, but only if I let them get a little too brown around the edges, giving them a ‚Äúcrunchy crust.‚Äù He despised waffles with a passion he usually reserved for bedtime, claiming the little squares were ‚Äútricky‚Äù and ‚Äústole the syrup.‚Äù He loved the color orange, not bright orange, but the deep, burnt orange of autumn leaves. He loved the feel of my old silk scarf, which he‚Äôd rub against his cheek when he was tired. He loved the rumbling groan of the garbage truck on Tuesday mornings, a sound that would send him sprinting to the window. He was a universe of tiny, specific, wonderful details. He was ours. He was Leo.

The fever started on a Wednesday. It began as nothing, a little cough at bedtime, a forehead that felt a degree too warm. I gave him some Motrin and tucked him in, thinking nothing of it. By midnight, he was screaming. Not a sick cry, but a scream of pure agony. His body was a furnace. The digital thermometer, when I could finally get it to stay under his tongue, read 104.2. A fear unlike anything I have ever known, a cold, primal terror, seized me by the throat and squeezed. We‚Äôve all had sick kids, the fevers, the stomach bugs. This was different. This felt like an invasion.

For the next seventy-two hours, our world shrank to the four walls of his dinosaur-themed bedroom. The air grew thick and heavy with the smell of sickness, that metallic, cloyingly sweet scent of a body at war with itself. We lived in a blurry, sleep-deprived nightmare. We took turns holding cold compresses to his forehead, his neck, his wrists. We had frantic, whispered conversations with the on-call pediatrician, who kept saying, ‚ÄúAs long as he‚Äôs hydrated, as long as he‚Äôs responsive, just monitor him.‚Äù But he wasn‚Äôt really responsive. He was delirious, his eyes glassy and unfocused, muttering a stream of nonsense words and phrases that didn‚Äôt connect. He didn‚Äôt know who we were. He thrashed in his sleep, his small body rigid with tension, his limbs jerking.

Thomas was my anchor in that storm. He was calm when I was sobbing, practical when I was falling apart. He charted every temperature, every dose of medicine, every sip of water Leo managed to get down. But I saw the terror behind his calm facade. I saw it in the tremor of his hand as he measured out the Tylenol, in the way he‚Äôd just stand in the doorway for long stretches of the night, watching the shallow rise and fall of Leo‚Äôs chest. He was helpless, and for a man like Thomas, a man who fixes things, helplessness is its own kind of hell.

I held Leo‚Äôs hand, so hot it felt like holding a live coal, and I prayed. I‚Äôm not a religious person, but in that dark, silent room, I prayed to every god I could think of, to the universe, to anything that might be listening. I begged. I bargained. I promised I would be a better mother, a better wife, a better person. I would never complain about being tired again, never be impatient when he asked ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for the hundredth time, never take a single, precious, ordinary moment for granted, if he would just come back to us.

On Saturday morning, I woke with a start, slumped in the uncomfortable armchair, my neck bent at a painful angle. The first thing I registered was the silence. The ragged, labored breathing that had been the soundtrack to our nightmare for three days was gone. In its place was a quiet, even rhythm. And the room was cold. The oppressive, suffocating heat that had radiated from the bed had vanished.

I scrambled forward, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs. I pressed my palm to his forehead. It was cool. Damp with sweat, but blessedly, miraculously cool. As my hand made contact, his eyelids fluttered open. The glassiness was gone. His eyes, the same deep, clear blue as his father‚Äôs, were focused. They looked right at me.

‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù His voice was a dry, cracked whisper. But it was his. It was *his voice*.

A sob tore out of my chest, a raw, ugly, animal sound of pure, unadulterated relief. I collapsed onto the edge of the bed, wrapping my arms around his small, fragile frame, burying my face in his sweat-damp hair, inhaling the scent of my son. He was back. He was here. Thomas must have heard me, because he came running into the room, his face a pale, exhausted mask. When he saw Leo, awake, conscious, looking at us, his composure finally broke. He just crumpled. He fell to his knees by the bed, his broad shoulders shaking as he wept without a sound.

The next day, Sunday, was the most beautiful day of my life. It felt like the world had been reborn in full color. The house itself seemed to exhale, to relax. Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dancing dust motes like tiny, joyful sprites. Thomas made his famous ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs okay‚Äù pancakes, and the warm, sweet smell of melting butter and maple syrup filled every room, chasing out the last ghosts of sickness. Leo was weak, his movements slow, but he was smiling. He laughed, a real, musical laugh, when our golden retriever, Buster, slathered his face with happy, wet licks. Every sound, every sight, felt like a sacred gift. I watched him sitting on the living room floor, slowly clicking his LEGOs together, his small brow furrowed in concentration, and I felt a profound, bone-deep gratitude that was almost painful in its intensity. The storm had passed. We had survived.

I was so happy. I was so drunk on relief that I didn‚Äôt see it. I didn‚Äôt recognize the first sign for what it was.

It happened on Monday morning, our first attempt at a return to routine. I put a plate of pancakes in front of him, the edges burnt just the way he liked them. Thomas, already dressed for work, ruffled his hair. ‚ÄúThink you‚Äôre strong enough to tackle that stack, champ?‚Äù

Leo smiled. It was a perfect, heart-melting smile that reached his eyes. He picked up his fork.

With his right hand.

It was such a small thing. A tiny, insignificant detail. It was like a single, sharp pebble hitting a vast pane of glass. A barely perceptible sound, a hairline fracture that you could only see if you caught it in just the right light. I just stared at his hand. He speared a piece of pancake, dipped it in the pool of syrup, and brought it to his mouth with a smooth, easy coordination. There was no awkwardness, no fumbling, none of the clumsy hesitation of a child using their non-dominant hand. It was natural. Effortless. Innate.

‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù I said, forcing my voice to sound light, casual, like I was making a playful observation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using your other hand.‚Äù

Thomas glanced up from his phone, where he was scrolling through emails. ‚ÄúSo? Maybe the fever rewired his brain. I read an article about that once. Something about neural plasticity. Ambidexterity is a sign of genius, you know.‚Äù He was trying to make a joke, to dismiss my concern before it could take root.

‚ÄúNo, Thomas, you don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I insisted, my eyes fixed on Leo. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs *never* done this. Not for anything.‚Äù I turned my focus back to our son. ‚ÄúSweetheart, try with your special hand. Your drawing hand.‚Äù

Leo stopped chewing. He looked at me, his head tilted slightly. And in that moment, I saw something I had never seen in him before. It wasn‚Äôt the simple, open confusion of a child being corrected. It was a flicker of something else. Something analytical. It was the brief, still pause of a performer who has been told they missed a cue, a researcher being presented with unexpected data. He looked down at the fork in his right hand, then at his empty left hand resting on the table, as if they were two unfamiliar tools he was evaluating for the first time.

Then he looked back at me, his blue eyes clear and unnervingly steady, and said, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always done it this way, Mommy.‚Äù

A chill, cold and sharp and deeply unsettling, snaked its way down my spine. It wasn‚Äôt a lie. It wasn‚Äôt a child‚Äôs fib or a moment of defiance. He said it with the flat, unwavering certainty of a person stating their own name. He genuinely believed it. A core fact of his existence, a detail as fundamental as his handedness, had been rewritten, and he was the only one who didn‚Äôt know it.

‚ÄúEleanor, stop,‚Äù Thomas said gently, his hand covering mine on the table. I hadn‚Äôt even realized my own was clenched into a tight, white-knuckled fist. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted. We both are. Let‚Äôs not invent problems where there aren‚Äôt any. He‚Äôs alive. He‚Äôs healthy. That is all that matters.‚Äù

He smiled at Leo, who smiled back, a perfect mirror of paternal affection. And in that moment, I felt a chasm open up at the breakfast table. Thomas and Leo on one side, smiling in the bright morning sun, and me on the other, suddenly alone in a cold, encroaching shadow.

That was the beginning. And once you start looking for the cracks, you see them everywhere. Or maybe, and this is the thought that keeps me awake at night, maybe you start making them yourself.

The changes were subtle at first, a slow accumulation of wrong details that, in isolation, could all be explained away. Leo had always been a whirlwind of noise. The house had been filled with a constant soundtrack of his chatter, his tuneless humming, the vroom-vroom of his toy cars, the roar of his plastic dinosaurs. Now, the house was often quiet. Eerily so. He would play for hours in his room, silently, meticulously. He‚Äôd line up his toy cars in perfect, color-coordinated rows. He‚Äôd build LEGO towers that were perfectly symmetrical, perfectly balanced, feats of engineering that the old, chaotic Leo would never have had the patience for.

Thomas saw it as a positive development. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a newfound focus,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, beaming with pride. ‚ÄúThe fever must have matured him.‚Äù I saw it as unnerving. The joyful, chaotic mess of his play had been replaced by a cold, sterile order.

One afternoon, I found him in the living room, just standing in front of the bookshelf. He wasn‚Äôt pulling books out or trying to climb it, as he might have done before. He was standing perfectly still, his head tilted, reading the spines of Thomas‚Äôs dense physics and engineering textbooks.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, sweetie?‚Äù I asked from the doorway.

‚ÄúLearning,‚Äù he said, without turning around. His voice was flat, devoid of its usual childish lilt.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit advanced for you, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù I tried to keep my tone light, playful.

He turned then, and looked at me. His expression was serious, impassive. ‚ÄúYou have to start somewhere,‚Äù he said, with the weary patience of a professor addressing a particularly slow student. Then he blinked, and the expression vanished, replaced by a perfect six-year-old‚Äôs smile. ‚ÄúCan I have a snack?‚Äù

When I told Thomas about it later that evening, he just laughed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a sponge! He‚Äôs just repeating things he‚Äôs heard me say. My brilliant boy.‚Äù Thomas‚Äôs pride was a shield, a thick, impenetrable wall against my growing fear. Every strange, cold thing Leo did, Thomas reframed as a sign of intelligence, of maturity, of recovery. He was so desperate for everything to be okay, so grateful to have his son back, that he couldn‚Äôt let himself see that the boy who came back was not the one we had lost.

The emotional disconnect was the hardest part. It was like a fundamental circuit in his personality had been snipped. Our old Leo was a creature of deep, sometimes overwhelming, empathy. If I stubbed my toe and yelped, he‚Äôd have tears in his eyes. If a character was sad in a movie, he‚Äôd need to climb into my lap and be held. That part of him, that sweet, sensitive core, was just‚Ä¶ gone.

Our goldfish, Bubbles, died. It was an ancient, sad-looking fish that Leo had won at a school fair. I found it floating at the top of the bowl one morning and braced myself for the inevitable meltdown. The old Leo would have been inconsolable. There would have been a tearful bathroom funeral, a thousand questions about life and death and fishy heaven. I called Leo into the kitchen. He stood on his little stool and peered into the bowl, his expression unreadable.

‚ÄúBubbles is gone, sweetheart,‚Äù I said softly, rubbing his back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

Leo didn‚Äôt look at me. He tapped the glass with his finger. ‚ÄúHis homeostatic processes have failed,‚Äù he stated, his voice as clinical as a lab report. ‚ÄúThe lack of sufficient oxygenation in the water led to widespread cellular death. Can we dissect him to see his heart?‚Äù

I physically recoiled. I snatched my hand back from his shoulder as if I‚Äôd been burned. It wasn‚Äôt the morbid curiosity of a child; it was the detached, academic interest of a scientist examining a specimen. I felt sick. I flushed the fish down the toilet, my hands shaking, and told him we couldn‚Äôt. He just shrugged. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù No tears. No more questions. Just a quiet, unnerving acceptance.

Thomas‚Äôs explanation? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs processing it intellectually. It‚Äôs a coping mechanism, El. He‚Äôs protecting himself from the sadness. He‚Äôs a smart kid.‚Äù

He was always a smart kid. That became the answer for everything.

I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I was constantly on edge, my nerves stretched taut, watching him, analyzing every word, every gesture. I became a detective in my own home, a spy in my own family. And he knew it. I am absolutely certain of it. He started to play a game with me, a quiet, cruel game of psychological warfare where he was the only other player who knew the rules.

It started with gaslighting, so subtle I barely noticed it at first. Small things. I‚Äôd be certain I left my keys on the hook by the door, a habit of a lifetime. We‚Äôd spend twenty minutes turning the house upside down, only for Leo to find them in the fruit bowl. ‚ÄúSilly Mommy,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, his voice sweet as honey, and Thomas would give me a look‚Äîthat worried, pitying look that was becoming more and more frequent.

One evening, I was paying bills at the kitchen table, my head swimming with numbers and spreadsheets. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt add up,‚Äù I muttered to myself, rubbing my temples.

From the living room floor, where he was building a perfectly symmetrical LEGO castle, his quiet voice piped up, clear as a bell. ‚ÄúYou carried the one incorrectly in the third column of the utility bill.‚Äù

I froze, my pen hovering over the paper. I checked my math. He was right. A simple, stupid addition error I‚Äôd overlooked three times. I stared at the back of his head, my blood running cold. He didn‚Äôt even look up from his castle.

He was isolating me from Thomas, and he was brilliant at it. He learned to perform. The moment he heard Thomas‚Äôs car in the driveway, his entire demeanor would shift. He‚Äôd become a bright, bubbly, affectionate six-year-old. He‚Äôd run to the door, throw his arms around his father‚Äôs legs, and shower him with affection. He‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI love you, Daddy,‚Äù a dozen times an evening. He never said it to me anymore. Not once since the fever.

The moment Thomas was out of the room, to take a shower or make a phone call, the performance would stop. The bright, loving smile would vanish, replaced by that flat, watchful neutrality. It was like a light switch being flipped off. The change was so abrupt, so complete, it made the hairs on my arms stand up.

I tried to talk to Thomas about it, again and again. I tried to explain the shift, the two versions of Leo. He‚Äôd listen, his face etched with concern, and then he‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúHoney, kids act differently with each parent. It‚Äôs normal.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs still angry with you for all the medicine you had to give him. He‚Äôll get over it.‚Äù Or, the one that hurt the most, ‚ÄúEleanor, I think you‚Äôre projecting your own anxiety onto him. You‚Äôre looking for problems.‚Äù

I even tried calling my mother. I started to tell her, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúMom, something‚Äôs different about Leo since he was sick.‚Äù But as I heard the words out loud, I heard how they sounded. I heard the inevitable follow-up questions, the concern that would quickly shift from Leo to me. I faltered, and ended up saying he was just being quiet and moody. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just post-viral fatigue, dear,‚Äù she‚Äôd said, and I‚Äôd agreed and changed the subject, feeling more alone than ever.

The final, decisive campaign against my sanity was waged over a simple glass of milk. We were at the dinner table. Thomas was telling a long, animated story about a problem at his engineering firm. I was only half-listening. I was watching Leo, who was pushing his peas around his plate with his fork. He caught my eye. He held my gaze, his own eyes unblinking, impassive. And then, slowly, with a deliberate, almost graceful movement, he nudged his full glass of milk with his elbow until it tipped over the edge of the table and crashed onto the floor, shattering.

‚ÄúLeo!‚Äù I shouted, jumping to my feet as milk and shards of glass spread across the hardwood.

Before Thomas could even react, Leo‚Äôs face crumpled. He burst into the most theatrical, heart-wrenching sobs I had ever heard. It was a performance worthy of an Oscar.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my fault!‚Äù he shrieked, pointing a trembling, accusatory finger at me. ‚ÄúMommy was looking at me funny! She had a scary face! She scared me and I jumped!‚Äù

Thomas rushed to his side, scooping him up out of his chair, away from the mess. ‚ÄúShh, it‚Äôs okay, buddy, it was an accident. It‚Äôs okay.‚Äù He held Leo, murmuring soothing words, and over his son‚Äôs shaking shoulders, he gave me a look of profound disappointment and fear. But the fear wasn‚Äôt for Leo. It was for me.

That night, after he had tucked Leo in and read him an extra story, the conversation I had been dreading finally happened. He closed our bedroom door and stood there, his arms crossed, his face a mask of sorrow.

‚ÄúEleanor,‚Äù he said, his voice heavy with a pain that broke my heart. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go on like this. You‚Äôre a bundle of nerves. You‚Äôre jumping at shadows. You‚Äôre yelling at him for spilling milk. He told me he‚Äôs scared of you sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not scared of me, Thomas, he‚Äôs playing you! He did it on purpose! Can‚Äôt you see?‚Äù The words sounded shrill and unhinged, even to my own ears. I sounded like a madwoman.

‚ÄúDo you hear yourself? Do you honestly hear what you‚Äôre saying? He‚Äôs a six-year-old child who almost died three weeks ago. I think you‚Äôre suffering from post-traumatic stress. I think you need to talk to someone. I made an appointment for you with a therapist, Dr. Mercier. It‚Äôs on Thursday.‚Äù

The trap snapped shut. He had won. The creature wearing my son‚Äôs face had successfully and completely painted me as the monster. I was no longer a mother protecting her child. I was a patient in need of a cure.

I went to the appointment. I sat in the plush leather chair across from a kind, bearded man with gentle, condescending eyes. I told him everything. The right hand, the goldfish, the math problem, the milk. I watched him nod and take notes on a yellow legal pad. I could see the diagnosis forming in his mind as clearly as if it were written on his forehead: *Post-traumatic stress. Maternal anxiety. Delusional paranoia triggered by child‚Äôs near-death experience. Potential for postpartum-like psychosis.* He explained that it was perfectly normal for mothers to develop these feelings, this hyper-vigilance, after a traumatic medical event. He prescribed me a low dose of an anxiolytic. I took the prescription. I had to play the part. I had to appear sane, compliant. It was the only way I could stay in the game.

At home, the creature, sensing its total and complete victory, grew bolder. It began systematically erasing the real Leo, memory by memory. The first drawing he ever made for me, a chaotic, joyful squiggle of burnt orange crayon that I had kept on the fridge for five years, disappeared. I found it torn into tiny, meticulous, confetti-like squares at the bottom of the recycling bin. When I asked him about it, his eyes were blank. ‚ÄúIt was messy,‚Äù he said.

His beloved Barnaby, the one-eyed bear who had been his constant companion, was next. I found him stuffed head-first in the kitchen trash can, buried under coffee grounds and eggshells. I pulled him out, my hands shaking with rage and grief. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old for that,‚Äù he told Thomas later, who praised him for being such a big boy and growing up so fast.

Each erased memory was a physical stab in my heart. I felt like I was the only person left in the world who remembered the real Leo. I would scroll through old photos and videos on my phone at night, the blue light of the screen illuminating my silent tears, just to prove to myself that the smudged, left-handed, chaotic, empathetic little boy had been real.

I had to get proof. Something tangible. Something Thomas and Dr. Mercier couldn‚Äôt explain away with a diagnosis.

My last, desperate idea came on a Saturday afternoon. Thomas was out at Home Depot. The house was quiet. I sat down with ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù at his little art table in the corner of the living room. My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my ears.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs draw, sweetie,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling slightly. I laid out a fresh piece of paper and a box of colored pencils. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you draw our family? Draw you, and Daddy, and me.‚Äù

He looked at me with that unnervingly calm gaze for a long moment, then picked up a black pencil. In his right hand, of course. He drew for nearly fifteen minutes, in total, unnerving silence. His movements weren‚Äôt the joyful, sweeping scribbles of a child. They were precise, controlled, the pencil held at a perfect angle, like an architect drafting a blueprint.

Finally, he pushed the paper towards me across the table. ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù

I leaned forward, and all the air left my body in a painful rush.

It wasn‚Äôt a drawing of a family. It was a diagram. A schematic. Three figures, constructed from neat, sharp-angled geometric shapes‚Äîrectangles for bodies, circles for heads. They had no faces, no hands, no hair. They were just‚Ä¶ forms. One tall, one small, one in between. Below them, printed in perfect, clean, adult-looking block letters, were the names: THOMAS. LEO. ELEANOR.

But that wasn't the part that made me want to scream. The figure labeled ELEANOR was different from the others. It had been violently scribbled over. A furious, dense, chaotic web of black lines scratched her out, obliterating the neat shape beneath, as if trying to erase her from existence entirely.

My voice was a whisper. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what is this part?‚Äù I asked, my finger hovering over the black chaos that was supposed to be me.

He looked at the drawing, then back at me. He raised his small, steady finger and pointed directly at the furiously scribbled-out figure. ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù he said, his voice completely flat, devoid of any emotion, any childishness. ‚ÄúYou are the error.‚Äù

The sound of the garage door opening, the rumble echoing through the house, made me jump. Thomas was home. In a flash, in a movement too quick and fluid for a six-year-old, ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù snatched the paper from the table, crumpled it into a tight, vicious ball, and tossed it perfectly into the wastebasket across the room just as Thomas walked in, whistling, holding a bag of mulch.

‚ÄúWhat are my two favorite artists up to?‚Äù he asked, smiling, oblivious.

‚ÄúDrawing!‚Äù ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù chirped, his voice instantly transforming, becoming bright and sweet and innocent. He held up a different piece of paper, one with a single, perfectly drawn, technically flawless flower on it.

I sat there, frozen, the words echoing in the silent, screaming space in my mind. *You are the error.* This wasn‚Äôt a phase. This wasn‚Äôt trauma. This was a project. A cleansing. And I was the variable that needed to be eliminated.

That night, I knew I couldn‚Äôt stay. I lay in bed, rigid, feigning sleep, listening to Thomas‚Äôs steady breathing beside me. I was a prisoner in my own home, with a husband who thought I was sick and a child who wanted me gone. My plan was half-formed, a frantic blueprint drawn by adrenaline and terror. I would wait until Thomas was deeply asleep. I would go downstairs, get the drawing from the trash can. That was my proof. My only proof. Then I would get Leo in the car, and I would drive. I would drive to my sister‚Äôs house three hours away. I would wake her up, I would show her the drawing, and I would make her believe me.

Around 2 a.m., when the house was settled into its deepest silence, I slipped out of bed. My bare feet made no sound on the hardwood floor. I crept downstairs and, my hands shaking, retrieved the crumpled ball of paper from the wastebasket. I smoothed it out on the kitchen counter in the dim light from the microwave clock. It was all there. The schematic figures. The names. The violent erasure of me. My proof. My sanity. I folded it carefully and put it in the pocket of my robe.

Then I went to his room. The star projector was on, casting a gentle, dancing starfield on the ceiling and walls. He was asleep, his breathing even and quiet. For a heartbreaking second, in the soft, dim light, he just looked like my Leo. My beautiful, innocent boy. A wave of love so fierce it was painful washed over me. He was still in there. He had to be. This thing had stolen him, but he was still in there somewhere.

I knelt by his bed and gently shook his shoulder. ‚ÄúLeo,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúBaby, it‚Äôs Mommy. We have to go. We‚Äôre going on a little trip.‚Äù

His eyes snapped open.

They weren‚Äôt sleepy or confused. They were wide, alert, and they glinted in the starlight like chips of blue ice. He looked right through me.

And then he opened his mouth and he screamed.

It was not a scream of fear or surprise. It was a calculated, piercing, ear-splitting shriek of pure, theatrical terror, a sound designed to wake the dead and summon armies. It was an alarm.

‚ÄúMOMMY, NO! YOU‚ÄôRE HURTING ME! DON‚ÄôT TOUCH ME! DADDY, HELP!‚Äù

The hallway light flashed on, blinding me. Thomas stood in the doorway, wild-eyed and frantic from being ripped from a deep sleep. His brain processed the scene in an instant: me, kneeling by the bed, my hand on his son. His son, sitting bolt upright, screaming, cowering away from me as if I were holding a knife.

‚ÄúEleanor! What the hell are you doing?!‚Äù he roared, his voice cracking with sleep and horror.

‚ÄúThomas, no, it‚Äôs not what it looks like! He‚Äôs lying!‚Äù I scrambled to my feet, fumbling in my pocket for the drawing. ‚ÄúI can prove it! Just look at this!‚Äù

But Thomas was already moving, crossing the room in two long strides, his face a mask of fury and terror. He wasn‚Äôt looking at me; he was looking at Leo. He scooped the screaming child into his arms, holding him tight. The creature buried its face in its father‚Äôs neck, its body wracked with performative sobs. And over Thomas‚Äôs shoulder, it lifted its head just enough to look at me. Its eyes were not crying. They were calm, cold, and utterly, devastatingly triumphant.

The rest is a blur of noise and flashing lights and deep, numbing shock. Thomas on the phone, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúMy wife‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs having some kind of breakdown‚Ä¶ I think she was trying to take him‚Ä¶ I think she was trying to hurt our son.‚Äù The police arriving, two of them, a man and a woman. The woman had kind, sad eyes. She asked me questions I couldn‚Äôt answer, my mind a static-filled void. I kept trying to tell them about the drawing, but in the chaos of being led out of the room, it was gone. It must have fallen out of my pocket. I begged them to look for it, to go back into the room, but they just gave me that same pitying, gentle look that Thomas and Dr. Mercier did. The look you give a person who is no longer a part of your reality.

My last memory of my home is standing on the front lawn in the cold, pre-dawn air, a coarse police blanket wrapped around my shoulders. Thomas stood on the porch, illuminated by the flashing red and blue lights, holding Leo‚Äôs hand in a white-knuckled grip. Leo wasn‚Äôt crying anymore. He just stood there, silent and still, watching them lead me to the car, his face a perfect, placid blank.

So now I‚Äôm here. In this quiet place with soft walls and kind nurses who call me ‚Äúhon‚Äù and tell me I‚Äôm safe. Dr. Mercier visits twice a week. He says I‚Äôm making excellent progress, that I‚Äôm starting to accept my diagnosis: a severe psychotic episode, triggered by acute trauma and stress. It‚Äôs a neat, tidy story. It makes sense to everyone. It explains everything.

Thomas writes me letters filled with a sad, distant love. He doesn‚Äôt visit. Dr. Mercier says it‚Äôs too soon, that it could be a trigger for me. He writes that Leo is doing so well. He‚Äôs at the top of his class in reading and math. He‚Äôs even started taking piano lessons, and he‚Äôs a natural. He says the house is so calm now, so peaceful. He says he misses the woman I used to be.

In his last letter, he included a photograph. It was taken at a school picnic last weekend. Thomas and Leo, smiling under a big oak tree, squinting in the bright sun. They look happy. Thomas looks relaxed, younger, the deep lines of stress around his eyes have softened. And Leo‚Ä¶ he looks perfect. A perfect, happy, handsome little boy in a bright orange t-shirt, his old favorite color.

I have stared at this photograph for days. It sits on my nightstand, a testament to the life I destroyed, the family I broke. It‚Äôs the final piece of evidence in the case against my sanity.

But if you look closely, if you look past the smiling faces and the bright sunshine, you can see it. The tiny, perfect, soul-destroying detail. The thing that keeps me awake at night in this quiet, safe room. The thing that proves I‚Äôm not crazy, and ensures that I will never, ever be free.

In the photograph, he‚Äôs holding a half-eaten red apple.

He‚Äôs holding it in his left hand.

He learned. The error has been corrected. The performance is now flawless. And I‚Äôm the only one in the world who knows.",3,1756057253.0,nosleep,0,0.8,False

**Kazuya and Yaemori arrived at the izakaya, the familiar setting stirring memories of their drunken night over a month ago that sparked their cohabitation.**

Yaemori (raising a glass, grinning): ‚ÄúMaster, let‚Äôs celebrate properly! Cheers!‚Äù

Kazuya (half-hearted): ‚ÄúJust one drink. We‚Äôve already had plenty at home.‚Äù

Yaemori (teasing): ‚ÄúTo celebrate your victory on the horizon! At a place like this, we‚Äôve gotta go all out!‚Äù

**Kazuya knew Chizuru couldn‚Äôt come tonight, and the thought of her out so late gnawed at him, his heart heavy with unease. Yaemori noticed his anxious expression.**

Yaemori (sighing, guilty): ‚ÄúMaster, I messed up. You were in a good mood, and I ruined it by suggesting we invite Chizuru-san, only to disappoint you.‚Äù

Kazuya (shaking his head, voice low): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. But where is she going so late? I‚Äôm really worried.‚Äù

Yaemori (nudging him): ‚ÄúMaster, are you already treating Chizuru-san like your girlfriend? Didn‚Äôt know you had such a possessive side! She‚Äôs always been independent and can handle herself‚Äîdon‚Äôt stress too much!‚Äù

**Kazuya understood, but the unease clung to him like a shadow. Despite time passing, he remained glum.**

Yaemori (cheering): ‚ÄúMaster, drink up! Maybe Chizuru-san will join us after she‚Äôs done!‚Äù

Kazuya (bitterly): ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt give me unrealistic hopes.‚Äù

**Just then, their phones pinged simultaneously with a group message from Chizuru: just ‚ÄúHel‚Äù and a location pin.**





**Ten Minutes Earlier, at the Caf√©**

**Chizuru was animatedly sharing details of her crowdfunded movie with OMATA, her eyes sparkling with passion. Suddenly, a wave of dizziness hit her, the room spinning.**

OMATA (feigning concern): ‚ÄúChizuru-chan, are you okay?‚Äù

Chizuru (weakly, clutching her head): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling dizzy‚Ä¶ Sorry, I need to go home.‚Äù

*OMATA thought, excitement flickering in his mind*: *‚ÄúThe drug‚Äôs finally kicking in. This is the latest high-tech stuff‚Äîcolorless, odorless, causes dizziness and weakness within minutes, leaving no strength to call for help. But who‚Äôd be thrilled with a limp fish? The magic is, in half an hour, she‚Äôll wake up, burning with desire, mistaking anyone nearby for her beloved. Then I can do whatever I want‚Äîshe‚Äôll throw herself at me!‚Äù*

**A lecherous grin spread across OMATA‚Äôs face:**

*‚ÄúSure, a big theater troupe scouted her, but with such a big opportunity, I deserve a reward! I wouldn‚Äôt have lured her out without this temptation. My plan‚Äôs going perfectly. Her stubborn purity made her storm off, giving me the chance to slip the drug into her coffee. The Roppongi hotel was a lie‚Äîlucky she didn‚Äôt agree, or I‚Äôd have shelled out for a room! She‚Äôs worth it, though. A love hotel nearby will do. Will she report me? I‚Äôll record her wild enjoyment‚Äîshe won‚Äôt dare. She‚Äôs a gem, so disciplined‚Ä¶ maybe even untouched? Or at least inexperienced. I‚Äôll teach her the ways of the world. If she behaves, I‚Äôll boost her career.‚Äù*

**OMATA stared at Chizuru, watching her consciousness fade. Chizuru realized she‚Äôd been tricked, but her strength was gone, unable to curse or cry for help. In her blurring mind, she thought:**

*‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Was I drugged? When? I‚Äôm so weak‚Ä¶ Will I lose my 21 years of purity like this? No‚Ä¶ Save me‚Ä¶ Kazuya, please save me‚Ä¶‚Äù*

**Chizuru fought to stay conscious but succumbed, collapsing onto the table. OMATA, seizing the moment, hoisted her onto his back and left the caf√©, heading for a love hotel. Playing the good guy, he muttered:**

‚ÄúLet me take you home.‚Äù





**Back at the Izakaya**

**Kazuya stared at the cryptic ‚ÄúHel‚Äù message, his heart sinking further.**

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Mizuhara trying to tell us?‚Äù

Yaemori (shrugging): ‚ÄúProbably forgot to lock her phone and sent it by mistake. I do that all the time.‚Äù

*Kazuya thought*: *‚ÄúHer phone case has a cover‚Äîshe wouldn‚Äôt misfire like that.‚Äù*

Yaemori (checking the message): ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you reply and ask? Her location‚Äôs actually nearby!‚Äù

Kazuya (hesitant): ‚ÄúYou reply. I need some air.‚Äù

Yaemori (nodding): ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll come with you!‚Äù

**They left the izakaya, intending to take the escalator down. But an elevator opened, and they stepped inside.**

Yaemori (cheerful): ‚ÄúMaster, cheer up! You don‚Äôt look like someone about to win!‚Äù

Kazuya (sighing): ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I feel awful inside.‚Äù

Yaemori (reassuring): ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about Chizuru-san. Trust her‚Äîshe‚Äôs a pro.‚Äù

The elevator descended two floors and opened. A man entered, carrying a woman on his back, her body draped in an oversized windbreaker, revealing only her legs in tight jeans and sandals. Kazuya and Yaemori stared at her legs, sandals and toes, a strange sense of recognition hitting them.

Kazuya (muttering): ‚ÄúMizuhara still hasn‚Äôt replied‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yaemori (decisive): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling her.‚Äù

**Yaemori dialed Chizuru‚Äôs number, and a familiar ringtone echoed in the elevator. She lifted the windbreaker, revealing Chizuru‚Äôs face.**

Yaemori (shocked): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Chizuru-san!‚Äù

OMATA (defensive): ‚ÄúYou know her? She‚Äôs my girlfriend. She was drunk, I‚Äôm taking her home‚Äîplease don‚Äôt interfere.‚Äù

**Hearing this, Kazuya froze, a surge of suppressed emotions‚Äîjealousy, confusion, betrayal‚Äîflooding him.**

*‚ÄúShe was meeting this guy? Why‚Äôs he carrying her? Are they together? Is this why she kept rejecting me? Then why did she kiss me last time?‚Äù*

**Kazuya knew little about Chizuru‚Äôs private life, and in his mind, she was always cautious. She couldn‚Äôt have been tricked. Yaemori, clearer-headed, shouted:**

‚ÄúWe lived with Chizuru-san for a while and never heard of a boyfriend. Something‚Äôs fishy!‚Äù

**Her words snapped Kazuya awake. He lunged forward, pulling Chizuru from OMATA‚Äôs back and princess-carrying her in his arms.**

**Chizuru, with the last of her strength, whispered faintly, Kazuya put his ear close to listen.**

‚ÄúKazuya‚Ä¶ you really‚Ä¶ came‚Ä¶ save me‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yaemori (furious): ‚ÄúMaster, this creep drugged Chizuru-san!¬†

**Rage surged through Kazuya, urging him to punch OMATA, but Chizuru‚Äôs limp weight in his arms held him back. OMATA, seeing his plan unravel, bolted when the elevator doors opened. The danger passed, Chizuru slipped into a deep, safe sleep. Kazuya hoisted her onto his back, taking a taxi to bring her home. He turned to Yaemori:**

‚ÄúI‚Äôll drop you off on the way.‚Äù

Yaemori (winking): ‚ÄúNo need, I‚Äôm meeting friends. Master, enjoy tonight!‚Äù

Kazuya (flustered): ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you talking about?‚Äù

Yaemori (grinning slyly): ‚ÄúChizuru-san was drugged, probably with that trendy stuff. She‚Äôll sleep for about 20 minutes, then wake up with her desires unleashed. Be sure to take‚Ä¶ safety precautions!‚Äù

1mz21ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/bassheadsunited/comments/1mz21ok/kiwi_ears_hbb_punch_versus_the_punch_audio_martilo/,Kiwi Ears HBB Punch versus the Punch Audio Martilo,"A/B comparison of the Kiwi Ears HBB Punch (""Punches"") versus the Punch Audio Martilo (""Martilos"").

I listened to the track ""Damn Your Eyes"" by Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa on a Hiby RS6 player. The only enhancement I used was Darwin Ultra, and the software player ran USB Audio in bit-perfect mode.

Let me begin with a brief preamble.

The Punches are hybrid in-ear monitors featuring a single 10 mm dynamic driver, two of the latest Knowles RAB 32257 balanced armature drivers, and two Sonion electrostatic drivers‚Äîthough it's not entirely clear to me whether there's one dual EST driver or two separate ones. Sensitivity is around 98 dB (¬±1 dB) at 1 kHz, with an impedance of 12 Œ©. They boast a pronounced sub-bass boost of about +15 dB.

The Martilos are also hybrids but with a different configuration: two 8 mm dynamic drivers, two Knowles RDE balanced armatures, and a single planar driver. Their sensitivity is about 100 dB (¬±1 dB) at 1 kHz, and impedance is 9 Œ© (¬±1.5 Œ©).

Since this is a foreword‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to listen carefully to the sound quality to notice the differences, where only punch/impact is immediately noticed. These differences exist, but they are subtle.

In terms of size, both the Punches and the Martilos are fairly large IEMs that won't feel comfortable in every ear. For my ears, they fit acceptably, but the fit is far from perfect. Still, as the saying goes, ""An audiophile must endure""‚Äîif you want a dense, powerful sound, you‚Äôll need to accept the fit and size of both pairs.

Starting with the high frequencies, I find that on the Punches they sound more cohesive and musical, while the Martilos deliver a more technical presentation. On the Martilos, the trailing decay is longer, and they sound sparklier than the Punches. Neither exhibits sibilance. Both sounds fairly natural in the high range.

As for the midrange, voices on the Punches come across as slightly recessed compared to the Martilos. I don‚Äôt know why, but male vocals sound more engaging on the Punches, whereas female voices feel fuller‚Äîmore substantial‚Äîon the Martilos. Guitars on both models sound equally biting and fierce (in a good way).

Now onto the low frequencies. Both models are unmistakably bass-head IEMs, and fans of neutral tuning should avoid them by a mile. But then again‚Ä¶ why not give them a listen? You‚Äôll realize there‚Äôs a different kind of sound here‚Äîfull of magic and wonder previously unknown to you. Who knows, you might even switch sides and become a bass-head. After all, low-end is the foundation of music. If the lows are only there to check a box, that‚Äôs exactly how the music will sound.

To dive into the details: the Punches seem to go deeper in the lows. I‚Äôm not sure why, since the measured frequency response doesn‚Äôt reflect a difference, but the sub-bass feels significantly more tangible and monumental on them, though outdoors you likely wouldn‚Äôt perceive this difference. On the Martilos, though, the punch feels more robust; the mid-bass is more pronounced, again, judging by the frequency response. The mid-bass character is certainly different between the two. I'm not saying there‚Äôs hardly any mid-bass on the Punches, but it truly feels stronger on the Martilos. The layering in the lows is well done on both.

The soundstage on the Punches is slightly narrower, whereas on the Martilos it feels broader. I didn‚Äôt detect any depth-related differences.

By the way, I‚Äôve concluded that the darker the sounding headphones, the narrower their stereo image. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same for everyone, but the effect holds true even when tuning via PEQ.

As for ""air,"" there‚Äôs plenty in both IEMs. Instruments are positioned with good separation. It‚Äôs not so spacious that you can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees, but the positioning is clear.

After this ‚Äúhead-to-head‚Äù comparison, here‚Äôs my final verdict:

Both pairs are firmly rooted in bass-head territory. The Martilos are better suited for listening in noisy environments or on the go, while the Punches shine in home setups. Though the Punches cost about $100 more than the Martilos, by my ears the Martilos should be worth about $50 more than the Punches. That‚Äôs, of course, purely my subjective judgment.

Thanks for reading. I hope this helps someone choose between these IEMs. In the end, one of these should be a ""must-have"" for true bass-heads.

1mz1wpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mz1wpt/my_friend_tried_to_kill_himself/,My friend tried to kill himself.,"He jumped from the 7th floor in the apartment complex he lives in. I don't know if its relevant but here's some context:

So lets call my friend A, A transferred out of the school i currently go to in February of this year. His top-of-the-class-valedictorian-Olympiad-winner family friend was transferring to that school, so his parents sent him there too. 

When I say he didn't want to go I mean DID NOT want to go, he was all ""how will I ever fit in there"" and ""I don't think I'll have many friends there"" when he left, ig that's one of the many things he was right about. 

Over the summer (April, May, June, July) A would call every person whose number he had, and he'd just ramble on and on about nothing in particular for like 45 mins straight. I'd get these yapping calls too, I always tried to pick up. From the 5-ish years of knowing A, he's not the most social being, often sticks to those whom he alr knows so i just expected him to be bored and assumed that's the reasoning behind his calls, that's one thing I was wrong about. 

After a while it stopped, idk what i was thinking but i never ended up reaching out. Then in late July i found out from A's best friend (Lets call him B) that A had been having a really hard time in the new school, especially after summer break. He'd gotten bullied and beaten so badly that he broke some part of his shoulder and can no longer play basketball. If anyone asked me to describe A in two words id say basketball lover, I swear hed marry a basketball if he could. 

On the 14th of this month i found out from rumors and when questioned B, that A had jumped off the 7th floor. According to B, A wanted to tell someone outside the people who alr knew about whats been going on in life, like get it off his chest, gain a new perspective or smthn so he approached this girl. She was with her friends who would tag along even if it was a private matter, so she kinda ignored him. When she left, he just kinda jumped. 

At some level Im angry at the girl, at A himself, i know its not right but i cant really help it.   
I also feel guilty like what if I HAD reached out, what if I'd invited him to a hangout I had at my place, taken him out for coffee just to catch up? Would it make a difference? What if I'd made good use of my brain and not just assume his reasons for calling so often? What if I'd texted him, asking how hes doing every once in a while? Would it make a difference?

Where we live mental health, bullying, suicide are considered so hush hush that if you talk about them in public people stare at you like you've committed cardinal sin. What do I do?

- Office Supplies (Staples, office equipment)
- Parking (meters, garages, parking fees)
- Pets (vet, pet stores, pet food)
- Shopping (retail, clothing, general purchases)
- **Software Subscriptions** (SaaS, development tools - business deductible)
- Subscriptions (streaming, memberships)
- Travel (hotels, flights, transportation)
- Transfers (between own accounts - exclude from totals)
- Utilities (electric, gas, internet, phone)
- **Web Hosting** (AWS, hosting services - business deductible)
- Unclassified (default for unmatched transactions)

**Income Categories:**
- **Salary Income** (direct deposit, payroll)
- **Other Income** (freelance, side projects, misc)
- Transfers (exclude from income totals)

### Business Deductions
Track tax-deductible categories:
- Software Subscriptions
- Web Hosting  
- Office Supplies

### Financial Calculations
- Total expenses (exclude transfers)
- Total income (exclude transfers)
- Net amount (income - expenses)
- Interest paid summary
- Business deductions total
- Category breakdowns with transaction counts

### Report Features
**Technology**: Single HTML file with embedded TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) + Bootstrap 5

**Report Sections:**
1. **Executive Summary** - totals, debug info toggle
2. **Income Breakdown** - salary vs other income with transaction tables
3. **Interest Paid Summary** - highlighted section with detailed breakdown
4. **Business Deductions** - tax-focused section
5. **Category Summary** - table with links to detail sections
6. **Transaction Details** - per-category listings with large expenses (>$200) highlighted

### UI Requirements
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface supporting multiple CSV files
- **Processing Feedback**: Loading states, error handling, success metrics
- **Debug Features**: Extensive console logging, processing statistics, error reporting
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Professional, responsive design with print support

### Debug Features (FULL NERD MODE)

- **Categorization Debug**: Real-time keyword matching logs
- **Amount Parsing Debug**: Raw strings ‚Üí parsed numbers for large amounts
- **Income Processing Debug**: Transaction filtering and categorization
- **Visual Debug Panel**: Collapsible section showing category breakdowns
- **Console Logging**: Comprehensive transaction processing logs
- **Error Reporting**: Multi-level error handling with detailed feedback

## Sample CSV Formats

**Format 1 - Separate Debit/Credit:**
```csv
Date,Description,Debit,Credit
1/15/25,Amazon Web Services,29.99,
1/14/25,Direct Deposit Salary,,4500.00
1/13/25,Starbucks,5.47,
```

**Format 2 - Single Amount Column:**
```csv
Transaction Date,Merchant,Amount,Category
01/15/2025,AWS Cloud Services,-29.99,
01/14/2025,Payroll Deposit,4500.00,
01/13/2025,Coffee Shop,-5.47,
```

**Format 3 - Complex Headers with Quoted Amounts:**
```csv
""Date"",""Description"",""Amount"",""Balance""
""1/15/25"",""Amazon Web Services"",""$29.99"",""$1,234.56""
""1/14/25"",""Direct Deposit"",""$4,500.00"",""$5,734.56""
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### TypeScript Structure
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  date: Date;
  description: string; 
  debit: number;
  credit: number;
  category: string;
  isLargeExpense: boolean;
}

class FinancialReporter {
  // CSV parsing with proper quoted field handling
  parseCSVRow(line: string): string[]
  
  // Flexible header detection
  detectHeaders(headers: string[]): HeaderMapping
  
  // Keyword-based categorization  
  categorizeTransaction(description: string): string
  
  // Income source separation
  generateIncomeBreakdownHTML(transactions: Transaction[]): string
  
  // Business deduction tracking
  generateBusinessDeductionsHTML(transactions: Transaction[]): string
}
```

### Categorization Logic
- Process categories in order (first match wins)
- Case-insensitive keyword matching
- Extensive transfer detection to exclude internal account movements
- Debug logging for interest transactions and large amounts

### Error Handling
- File reading errors with detailed messages
- CSV parsing validation 
- Row-level error reporting
- Malformed data graceful handling
- Processing statistics and warnings

## Success Criteria
- Processes multiple CSV formats automatically
- Accurately categorizes transactions with debugging visibility
- Identifies business deductions for tax purposes
- Separates salary from other income sources  
- Tracks interest payments separately
- Provides comprehensive debug information
- Generates professional, print-ready reports

```javascript
// Categories array - ordered list for display
let CATEGORIES = ['Transfers', 'Auto', 'Bank Fees', ...];

// Business categories array - subset of CATEGORIES
let BUSINESS_CATEGORIES = ['Office Technology', 'Web Hosting', ...];

// Keywords mapping - category name to array of keywords
let CATEGORY_KEYWORDS = {
  'Auto': ['chevron', 'shell', 'gas station', 'car wash', ...],
  'Groceries': ['safeway', 'whole foods', 'trader joe', ...],
  ...
};
```

#### LocalStorage Integration
```javascript
// Save format - must match Financial Reporter expectations
const data = {
  categories: CATEGORIES,
  keywords: CATEGORY_KEYWORDS, 
  business: BUSINESS_CATEGORIES
};
localStorage.setItem('financialReportCategories', JSON.stringify(data));
```

#### UI Components
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Show total categories, keywords, business categories, average keywords per category
- **Add New Category Form**: Name input, keywords input (comma-separated), business checkbox
- **Save Status Alerts**: Toast notifications for save confirmations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions

### Integration with Financial Reporter

The Category Manager must be fully compatible with the Financial Reporter:

1. **Shared Data Format**: Both tools use identical localStorage structure
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Category Manager immediately affect Financial Reporter
3. **Keyword Prioritization**: Categories processed in order (first match wins)
4. **Case Insensitive Matching**: All keyword comparisons use lowercase

### User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup**: User opens Category Manager, sees default categories
2. **Customization**: User adds/removes keywords based on their banking patterns
3. **Business Marking**: User marks appropriate categories as business deductible
4. **Save Changes**: User clicks Save to persist customizations
5. **Use Reporter**: User switches to Financial Reporter to process CSV files
6. **Iterative Improvement**: User returns to Category Manager to refine rules

  const saved = localStorage.getItem('financialReportCategories');
  if (saved) {
    const data = JSON.parse(saved);
    CATEGORIES = data.categories || DEFAULT_CATEGORIES;

I had a medical issue rise up over the last several years that made me drop from lifting (really, almost all activity lol) but have the under control now and have resumed.  I haven't tracked my calories in years and frankly, I'm not sure if I want to go back to that life of measuring how much sugar i put in my coffee. 

However, lets be honest - if you want to recomp you absolutely have to pay close attention to the calories and macros.   The challenge for me is knowing really how much lean mass I have under all this arctic insulation and how much protein I really need, how much carbs, total calories etc.  Really don't know where to start - have just been focusing hard on clean lean protein (sashimi, chicken breast) fruits and veg but without an actual plan or target.   

Wondering if there's a really good book focused just on this, or a web calculator that is reasonably accurate, or if this is something I could go to a nutritionist or wellness center for ? Or perhaps a trainer with experience in recomping people ?   ",1,1756056672.0,beginnerfitness,2,1.0,False

This community really made all of the difference. I used Study Hall and ThirdRock notes (I had taken a PMP prep course a year ago). Most of my SH exams were about 73% average. I did the full mock exams and got a 71, 73, then retook the first one after a month and got a 82. Watched a few mindset videos (thought ARs was the best), a few of David's videos. Also used PM Aspirant, which was super helpful in playing the process mapping game, extra exam prep, and videos to help clarify concepts.

My exam:

* 6-7 drag and drops; some of them literally made zero sense and I felt like I was guessing
* no calculations
* Very similar to SH, EXCEPT the answer choices were very different. This is where I really struggled. I knew what should happen based on the question, but the answer choices were so out of left field that I literally felt like I was guessing. The mindset did allow me to eliminate some, but sometimes I literally had no clue and just went with my gut. I stopped flagging questions for review because I figured - why bother - I already wasn't sure, no point in second-guessing myself later.
* TIME MANAGEMENT - I averaged about 50sec per question in SH. I never thought I would have an issue with time because I'm usually a fast test taker. I had 10 minutes left on the exam! I almost ran out of time and realized that in the middle section, so I had to start speeding up. 

I took the exam from home, which I thought was very easy and totally worth it. It was comfortable to be home, drinking my coffee during the exam. I work from home normally so I have reliable wifi. BUT you do have to wait 24 hours for results and that was not fun.

1mz1prh,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1mz1prh/deleting_social_media_1_week_in/,deleting social media.... 1 week in.,"I feel like a lot of people I read about describe their social media detox process as feeling isolated, not fishing for likes/comments anymore, etc. I had a lot of reasons for quitting that were mostly the same as everyone else. Recognizing I was literally living in moments with capturing pictures or videos to share at the forefront of my mind - didn't realize I was doing this until I couldn't do it anymore. It was jaw-dropping. For me, though, I'm not craving likes and comments because I almsot never got them to start with. I was surrounded by a very large mutual circle of 'friends' (like... 50+ of us, all mutual on FB and insta). I would watch them all get 50++ sometimes even 100++ likes on their posts, and HUNDREDS of comments - just for simple posts. A picture of their decorated door. Their coffee. A selfie on the first day of school. Meanwhile, I would post similar things, and usually got 0 engagement - maybe 1-2 likes on a good day. I was watching everyone ""thrive"" with each other and interact with each other and I felt more or less invisible. Like standing in a big crowded room and being the only one no one is talking to. 

This was a big reason I deleted - this was affecting my mental health BIG TIME. To be honest, real life is a pretty accurate reflection of how I am being perceived on SM. But now, I'm not  seeing what any of these fake people are doing. Now, I realize they were never my friends to begin with. I have 2-3 close friends (none of which live nearby, unfortunately). But now I am slowly becoming more okay with just not dealing with people's drama. 

After deleting, I started to notice all of the other shit that I had been doing and the altered ways my mind was working because of social media. I am a runner and I started to notice myself not even focused as much on my run as much as I was on sharing the metrics on my instagram story afterwards. Like WOW.

I craved a simpler life. I craved a life where I just do not care about anyone's input or thoughts about me, even if that means being alone. I am lonely a lot but it is really refreshing not thinking nonstop about whether so-and-so saw my post or whether it got likes overnight. It's refreshing to do things for no other reason than I just want to do them, not to get a nice pic or video to share. I am hoping as time passes, I will get my creativity and inspiration back that has been lost to decades of social media/internet addiction. ",17,1756056379.0,simpleliving,5,0.77,False

1mz1pc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mz1pc4/my_25f_relationship_with_my_coworker_35m_left_me/,"My (25F) relationship with my coworker (35M) left me confused, anxious, and traumatized - Do I change work?","Hi everyone, I really need an outside perspective on my breakup because I feel stuck, guilty, and unable to move on.

I dated a coworker who is 10 years older than me. From the start he was very affectionate, charming, and good with words. He told me I was his ‚Äúperfect match‚Äù, checked all of the boxes, he wanted to get married. I always told him I needed time to get to know him better, but he pushed the idea that he already knew I was the one. In the beginning I thought he was a fboy but he said ‚ÄúI never do one-night stands - I‚Äôm a ‚Äúrelationship guy,‚Äù and that he only dates seriously so I took him seriously.

He made me open up and I told him early on about my vulnerabilities and talked about my family issues and low self-esteem, that I have attachment issues and fear of abandonment. He reassured me by saying: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve never broken up with anyone‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe will work on you together‚Äù. He told me everything I ever wanted to hear. At the time, that made me feel safe ‚Äî but in the end, he did break up with me and never lived up to anything he said.

He introduced me to his parents and extended family (I even went to his aunt‚Äôs birthday ‚Äî apparently the first girlfriend ever invited), and after only 3 months he talked about moving in together. He even showed me an engagement ring, which was the same ring from his ex-fianc√©e. When I told him I didn‚Äôt want that same ring, he got angry.

He told me about his past: 16 relationships before me, with 7 women supposedly cheating on him. He was engaged once but the last year of that relationship was not good and he called her a manipulative narcissist. He told me girls had used him and his money a lot in the past because he is too nice and helpful.

Something else to note: he was very stressed about his age and wanting kids as soon as possible. He made comments about running out of time and pressured the idea of marriage and children quickly. If it wouldn‚Äôt work out with me he would continue to look for the ‚Äúright person‚Äù.

In the beginning, he promised dates and traveling, but apart from the first candlelit dinner at home, he never took me out. The few times we went for coffee or lunch after or during work, he told me those counted as ‚Äúdates‚Äù and that I should stop asking for more. He never got me flowers (I‚Äôm not materialistic, but I wanted some romantic effort). Whenever I expressed my needs, he would tell me I was ‚Äúnever satisfied.‚Äù He also seemed stingy with money ‚Äî he often talked about it which made it obvious.

He always involved his sister and best friend in our relationship; every issue we had, he discussed with them, and often acted based on their opinions instead of his own. They never got to hear my perspective of things. I wish I had realized this earlier and told him and his sister.

Sex was another huge pressure point. Our sexual chemistry was insane, but I never trusted him enough to sleep with him ‚Äî I‚Äôm very cautious with that since I‚Äôm really emotional. Still, he gave me a deadline ‚Äî if I didn‚Äôt sleep with him by then, he would break up with me. I also discovered he had a lot of sex toys and condoms at home, which made me feel like sex was a much bigger focus for him than emotional connection. I would be fine with all of it if he had just put more effort.

Even though I initially didn‚Äôt want to date anyone from the office (because I feared it would be uncomfortable if things didn‚Äôt work out), he persuaded me otherwise. He told me I didn‚Äôt trust him enough, and even said he would change jobs for me ‚Äî which convinced me to give it a try. But despite all his reassurances, I had a gut feeling from the very beginning that something wasn‚Äôt right. That feeling never went away.

As the relationship went on, he withdrew more and more. He only wanted to stay home, watch TV, cuddle, and then go back to work or gaming. He was usually too tired after work to do anything. I felt like we were in a marriage after only a few months. He knew I had an active lifestyle and loved to do outside activities. Meanwhile, my anxiety got worse. In my head his texts became slower and colder compared to the beginning, and I started overthinking every message. I panicked when he didn‚Äôt reply, got angry when I felt ignored, and constantly needed reassurance.

I‚Äôll admit I got reactive. Once, after a long day of barely hearing from him, I snapped and told him to ‚Äújust get married to your game and make a family with it‚Äù. He broke up with me immediately, called me immature, and said he couldn‚Äôt deal with me anymore. I begged him to stay, promised I‚Äôd change, and apologized ‚Äî and we got back together. But the cycle of me wanting more and him giving less never really stopped.

Sometimes he lashed out too. Once he removed me on Snapchat (the only place we communicated) out of irritation, another time he said ‚Äúfuck you,‚Äù and another time he told me he was ‚Äúso damn sick‚Äù of me. I wanted to keep in touch a lot and he said ‚Äúgo get a hobby, you‚Äôre obsessed with me‚Äù.

Whenever I tried to express my feelings I felt neglected or I was the one saying sorry(?) and it became harder for me to open up. I came to the conclusion that whenever I acted cold or distant he would show me affection but I couldn‚Äôt deal with that push and pull dynamic so I wrote paragraphs telling him how unloved, un prioritized and lonely I felt.

The breakup was sudden and messy. He ended it over SMS ‚Äî saying we weren‚Äôt compatible and he wasn‚Äôt the right guy for me. After that, everything escalated. I had bought a computer through his friend, and when it was time for me to pay for the computer my ex suddenly switched 180: threatening me, calling my friend, and even getting his sister to write to me because I took a lot of time to pay back. Eventually, he blocked me everywhere.

It‚Äôs been 9 months since. We have never spoken and I‚Äôm still blocked. We see each other at work sometimes. His friends also work there so I‚Äôm always on guard. It‚Äôs impossible to stop over analyzing him or his friends and stop thinking about him overall. Recently, he even sent me a random work-related message that wasn‚Äôt really necessary, which just left me even more confused. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still attached to him.

Through all of this, the biggest thing I can‚Äôt shake is that his actions never matched his words. He promised me love, marriage, family, consistency ‚Äî but what I got was withdrawal, avoidance, and eventually rejection. That mismatch is what has left me so confused and hurt.

I feel traumatized, like I can‚Äôt function without his presence. Being alone feels harder than before, and I constantly imagine him giving the love, effort, and romance I wanted to someone else. I keep wondering if I self-sabotaged the relationship with my reactivity and overthinking, or if he was emotionally unavailable, manipulative, and just not capable of real intimacy.",1,1756056352.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False
1mz1p60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1mz1p60/more_stress_and_another_flare/,More stress and another flare,"Been diagnosed with CPPS/PS after several cultures and tests over the years have been negative.  About a year ago my Uro started telling me to watch my urine as I was passing an active stone at the time.  So I peed into a glass, and that sort of became a habit.  

Over the last 12 months I'll see white flakes in my urine, usually at the same time my prostate feels tight or sore.  It's not like discharge that would come with an STD or UTI, but random flakes of white which I've been told is likely Prostatic secretions/corpora amylacea. 

It freaks me out when it happens, and of course starts the cycle of worrying about infection and I'm going to get real sick.  However this has been a full year of this.  Urologist is annoyed with me (as I am with myself) and told me, ""Look if you really had an infection, you'd be sick and your health would decline with you possibly being in the hospital or worse"".

I usually output pretty good urine-wise, sometimes it's frequent or urgent depending on hydration levels (I aim for a gallon a day).  Other symptoms are a squeezing feeling in the prostate, and sometimes a quick shooting pain that jolts from the prostate to the shaft.

I'm not searching for the ""magic antibiotic"", as I'm pretty sure (and my urologist thinks so too) that this is stress-related.  Case in point, the last two weeks I've been working 50hrs/week with little rest and my house is being rebuilt from the studs so it's been juggling a lot of stuff lately.  I'm wound up tight, anxious, and overwhelmed.  The entire time I'm throwing out these flakes and having increase prostate pain. 

I've had a flare this bad before and it was an animal of mine in the hospital who sadly passed away.  After I was able to relax and process the symptoms subsided and felt almost normal.

This condition is maddening and I feel alone in it.  My partner doesn't understand how it affects me.  I'm looking for a therapist to talk to to see if I can learn to relax.

Some stats.  I'm 50, very sedentary (office worker), have bad knees so I can't walk much, previous cultures (up to 2 months ago) all negative, no stds, high-stress, 2 cups of coffee in the morning, vape nicotine thorughout the day, my diet is pretty decent and I've lost 35 lbs in 5 mo but have 20 to go.  I'm on the Autism spectrum which makes it hard to process a lot of information and I get anxious.  

Anyways, not sure what I'm posting here, but when searcing this subreddit for ""White flakes"" there's not really much information besides ""infection or bladder"".  

My urologist said, ""Stop chasing the flakes, you're going to go crazy, focus on how you feel"".",3,1756056342.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

1mz1ogl,http://www.8grams.store,What should a ‚ÄúCoffee Encyclopedia‚Äù app include?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a coffee enthusiast and I‚Äôm working on an idea for a small mobile app ‚Äî something like a digital coffee encyclopedia / book, always ready to be used when needed.

The idea would be to offer a simple, affordable app (probably paid, but symbolically, like $0.99) that brings together:
	‚Ä¢	üìñ History & origins of coffee (countries, regions, historical anecdotes)
	‚Ä¢	üå± Varieties & processing methods (arabica vs robusta, fermentation, drying, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	‚òï Brewing methods (espresso, V60, Aeropress, French press, etc.) with guides
	‚Ä¢	üëÉ A flavor wheel / sensory guide to help describe coffee
	‚Ä¢	üó∫Ô∏è Maybe even an interactive map of producing countries

Before I go further, I‚Äôd love to get your input:
	
1.	What sections or features would you consider essential in such an app?

2.	Would you prefer a purely informative app (like a digital book), or something more interactive (quizzes, personal tasting journal, ability to rate coffees)?

3.	Would a $0.99 one-time purchase feel fair for this type of content, or would you prefer a free version with optional paid extras?

4.	Have you come across similar apps before? What did you like or dislike about them?

Any ideas or feedback would be hugely appreciated üôè

Thanks a lot!

That matter, when shaped in a certain way, suddenly gazes back at the universe and says, ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù Perception isn‚Äôt just the processing of inputs.

Some argue this is a puzzle that can be solved. All we need is more funding, more computational power, and more time, the argument goes.

What nonsense.

Disdain and disbelief cannot erase the fact that to be aware is to stand in a place where the finite brushes the infinite.

The answer, it turns out, has been staring at us all along. Consciousness isn‚Äôt an accident of biology. It‚Äôs a fundamental part of reality, present before the first atom came to be.

1mz1khk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mz1khk/explore_bosch_tqu60307_verocafe_espresso_machine/,Explore Bosch TQU60307 VeroCafe Espresso Machine Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"The Bosch TQU60307 800 Series VeroCafe Fully Automatic Espresso Machine has been my daily brewing companion for the past couple of weeks, and it has definitely made an impression. Testing this compact yet feature-packed espresso machine has been both a treat and an eye-opener. From its elegant design to its jaw-dropping convenience, the Bosch TQU60307 truly presents itself as the barista in your home. That being said, no product is perfect, and this one is no exception. Here's my detailed breakdown of what this espresso machine does well and where it falters.

**Sleek and Modern Design**  
This machine's silver exterior is a stunner in the kitchen. Its clean lines and compact size (measuring 18.4""D x 13.86""W x 15""H) mean it doesn't hog valuable counter space, despite being packed with technology. The five-inch Active Select Display is easily one of the highlights; it‚Äôs intuitive, responsive, and makes navigating the various coffee options straightforward. Everything has a minimalistic yet thoughtful layout. Of course, it's not just about looking pretty. Having a sturdy build that weighs 22 pounds, this espresso maker feels premium and durable, unlike some flimsier options I‚Äôve encountered. Oh, one small gripe‚ÄîI wish the integrated milk container wouldn‚Äôt stick out as much; it slightly messes with the overall seamless aesthetic.  

**Brew It Your Way With Ease**  
The magic really begins once you power up this automated marvel. One touch is all it takes to whip up a cappuccino, latte macchiato, or an espresso. I even tried the coffee pot function, which is especially helpful when hosting guests (or when you need multiple cups to power through your day). The machine offers full control over strength and aroma with three aroma profiles‚Äîmild, balanced, distinctive‚Äîand four coffee strength options. While testing, I found myself favoring the ""balanced"" profile for mellow mornings and ""distinctive"" when I needed a stronger kick. Adjusting settings is a genuinely simple task, and I love that there's no steep learning curve.

**Home Connect App Convenience**  
As someone who is terrible at remembering to prep my coffee ahead of time, the Home Connect app became my saving grace. It allowed me to prepare my coffee remotely, which was honestly one of the coolest features‚Äîa game changer when I was still stuck in traffic but wanted to come home to a hot cup of flat white. The app also introduces a world of over 35 customizable beverages, which feels like having a full-fledged caf√© in your kitchen. Admittedly, some drinks are nearly indistinguishable (like the coffee crema and latte variations), but the sheer variety is still impressive.

**Advantages**  
- Beautifully sleek design perfect for modern kitchens.  
- Home Connect app adds massive convenience and versatility.  
- Impressive variety of over 35 coffee beverages.  
- User-friendly Active Select Display streamlines customization.  

**Personalizing Every Sip**  
One of the best features is the level of customization the machine offers. Each cup, whether a bold ristretto or creamy latte macchiato, felt tailored to my preferences. The ceramic grinder does an exceptional job delivering exactly the right consistency for the beans I selected. With an optimally controlled flow rate and ideal temperature for each drink, I could tell the Bosch TQU60307 focused on quality as much as convenience. My neighbor tried a flat white and remarked how professional it tasted. Can we talk about how killer that aroma strength customization is? I usually dial it up to max for my weekend treats.

**Downsides**  
- Milk frothing could be more consistent; some lattes felt foam-heavy.  
- Cleaning the integrated milk container requires extra patience.  
- A bit noisy during the coffee grinding process.  

**Guided Maintenance Simplified**  
Regular maintenance of espresso machines has always been my Achilles' heel, so the guided cleaning system, Calc‚Äôn Clean, was a relief. With step-by-step instructions, the machine made descaling a total breeze. Given how crucial maintenance is for preserving flavor, this feature adds genuine value. The Calc‚Äôn Clean does require some time, but it‚Äôs worth the effort as it saves potential headaches associated with neglecting care routines.

**Other Options**  
It‚Äôs fair to stack this espresso machine against market competitors‚Äîparticularly ones like the Breville Barista Touch and the Jura E8. While the Breville offers more hands-on control, it lacks the sheer automation Bosch brings to the table. Jura machines, on the other hand, often provide a quieter experience, especially during grinding, but come with a heftier price tag. Among these rivals, the Home Connect app remains where Bosch shines brightest, delivering convenience that others can‚Äôt fully compete with at this level.

**Quality for Price**  
Speaking of pricing, this machine lands squarely in the premium automated espresso machine tier. Though the cost might feel steep, you're essentially paying for the advanced app integration, diverse drink options, and simplified maintenance. Personally, it feels justified for anyone who values reliability and customization in their coffee routine. This espresso maker‚Äôs features outweigh its minor negatives, making it an investment worth considering.

1mz1hvh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz1hvh,Review: Four Seasons Lanai,"In July, my partner and I traveled to Lanai for 5 nights, booking a stay at Four Seasons Lanai through u/alex_travels. Sorry for the length of this review! TL;DR - Overall, it was a great vacation other than a few minor things and we‚Äôre already trying to plan our trip back!

**Context:** My partner and I (30s, DINKs) traveled to FS Lanai after a stop in Oahu at the Ritz Waikiki Beach (honestly, even though RC properties aren‚Äôt loved on this sub, it‚Äôs a decent option for Waikiki IMO). Because I‚Äôve been to Hawaii multiple times and we visited the Big Island and Maui last year, I requested something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù for part of this trip. Will also note - we have two different travel styles: he loves to relax while I need to be active and try something new all the time. You might be thinking Lanai is not an island for activities: it‚Äôs both right and wrong. I‚Äôll get into it later but it all worked out. Also worth noting that I love a great deal. While chubby, FS Lanai was a fantastic deal for us because flights to and from HNL, most intra-island transportation, some activities, and some meals were comped. Only addition costs were lunch/dinner (we never had both in the same day), some excursions and tips.

**Resort/Room: 4.5/5** The hard product is gorgeous. Obviously the resort is well maintained and well cared after. We booked a Partial Ocean View room and thanks to Alex, we were upgraded to an Ocean View. I am also really sensitive to noise and because I mentioned it to Alex, she made magic happen and our room was literally in the farthest corner of the resort, top (upper) floor. Some might not love being so far and isolated from the main building but we loved it; in our 5 nights there, I don‚Äôt think we saw another guest in the hallways by our room. And the view was *chef‚Äôs kiss* (a pod of Spinner Dolphins welcomed us the first day). We would spend a few hours here and there throughout the stay just hanging out in the lanai playing cards and enjoying the view. My one negative and this is probably an unpopular opinion but I thought there were too many plants and the fact that many weren‚Äôt native hurt my heart a bit. I felt bad because there was one staff member who seemed to spend her entire day sweeping the same walkway of leaves; I found ants one night in the room around the Nespresso and hot water pitcher; and I made a game each day of collecting leaves and wilted flowers out of the adult pool. Just a thought that maybe 25% less plants might still do the trick?

**Service: 4/5** This is where we had a few challenges. First, the good stuff: the breakfast, housekeeping, transportation staff were wonderful. We loved the staff members who worked the breakfast shift and had some lovely conversations with them each morning. We also met a guest experience manager who was awesome - not only was he super helpful with recommendations for food, things to see, etc. but he gave us some lovely ceramic coffee cups when we left (I also think this was because of Alex?)! The not as good: the Ambassador Desk (Front Desk) staff weren‚Äôt my favorite other than the gentleman who checked us out on the last day. Honestly, minor grips but it felt like pulling teeth to get basic information. When checking in, the staff member asked if we wanted to go over our itinerary for the stay and when I said ‚Äúyes,‚Äù she acted surprised and breezed through it barely stopping to answer my questions (e.g., when and how should we check-in for our activities). We were also checking in during the lead up to the arrival of the tsunami waves and I swear, I couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer about contingency plans other than the hotel would call me if we needed to get to higher ground. I also wanted to know about how to use my free breakfast credit for in-room dining or how to sign up for yoga on the beach and to this day, still no clue. I know the locals probably weren‚Äôt worried about the tsunami but just a smidge more detail would have been more helpful than dismissive answers; I personally like more communication than less. One piece of advice I would also give is to book Nobu for the first seating or last. They got so busy for our 7:30pm reservation that we probably spent 15-20 mins waiting to be seated, get water, and receive menus. When the restaurant thinned out, service was good but the beginning was a little rough.

**Activities/Miscellaneous Things: 4.5/5** The resort is undergoing renovations right now to the entrance and the Osteria Mozza restaurant. When we were at the pool, there were times I heard some banging and hammering but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt loud enough to bother me - my AirPods easily drowned out the noise. But, given the construction, the hotel is offering each guest one free activity per day - and these are real activities that normally cost between $100-250 per person. We did archery, an adventure course (think Ninja Warriors) and snorkeling complimentary (and paid for a Jeep rental and to see the observatory other days). As I mentioned earlier, I love activities and excursions when I‚Äôm on vacation so this was perfect for me. Basically our days consisted of breakfast, activity and then hanging out by the pool before late lunch or early dinner. For us, this was a perfect mix of movement and chill. I will say, if you aren‚Äôt remotely interested in a pool and/or beach or want to be in an adrenaline rush all day, then yeah, maybe Lanai isn‚Äôt for you. But I would be hard pressed to say it‚Äôs boring or there‚Äôs nothing to do. Another piece of advice - book your activities ahead of time; they do hit capacity if you wait until you get to the resort, especially since there are a good number offered for free. Also, I suggest mapping out what you want to do and then call and book everything while you have someone on the phone with you. I tried combinations of email, booking via the app, and phone and with the former two, it would be days upon days of emailing back and forth without anything confirmed and just getting bounced from one person to the next. And then last note in this section, there are six resident birds (parrots, macaws) and koi that live on the property. I spent 15-20 minutes each day just talking to the birds on our way to and from the lobby - big personalities! I loved it.

**Food: 4/5** I‚Äôm a foodie - I don‚Äôt need a Michelin starred restaurant but I want something tasty, especially if it costs a decent amount of money. Based on that (albeit subjective) criteria, FS Lanai easily passed. While I didn‚Äôt have any last meal dishes, food was generally good and they were generous portions. Because breakfast was free for us, we had a lot of food each morning (usually the works!), ate a late lunch and skipped dinner or skipped lunch and had an early dinner. Nothing was mind-blowingly good (even Nobu) but would eat again. Lots of fresh food and local cuisine. Can‚Äôt wait to try Osteria Mozza when it reopens. The only negative was that coffee was terrible (sorry!) - brewed, French press, espresso, all not great. I usually drink my coffee black and had to add almond milk the last 3 days.

All in all our vacation was fantastic. We already love Hawaii and this just sealed the deal. I joke that my partner almost became a Lanai resident because we loved it that much.",10,1756055887.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

I get that every workplace is different, but in my current job, I feel like a total outsider. Like I‚Äôll never really be accepted.

I‚Äôm not antisocial. I‚Äôm polite, friendly, and I can hold a conversation. But I have boundaries. I don‚Äôt want to do small talk all the time, and I don‚Äôt want to go with the group for every coffee break. And honestly? I can see the distaste on some people‚Äôs faces when I politely decline.

Lunch together, for example, is rough for me. I‚Äôm super sensitive to food and textures, so I really don‚Äôt like being in places where a lot of people are eating. And when I try to explain it, people just don‚Äôt get it. They look at me like I‚Äôm some kind of weirdo.

I was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway, chasing the last bit of daylight, hoping to find a good spot to park for the night. Most campgrounds were either full or closed, and I started feeling like I‚Äôd have to settle for a crowded roadside pull-off.

Just when I was about to give up, I noticed a narrow dirt path that disappeared behind a line of tall eucalyptus trees. Something about it felt inviting, so I decided to take the chance and follow it. After a short, bumpy drive, I came out to this breathtaking little cliffside clearing overlooking the ocean. No other vans, no signs, no noise, just the sound of waves crashing against the rocks below.

I parked, opened up the back doors, and set up my small camping chair facing the water. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the entire sky lit up in orange and pink, and the ocean looked like it was on fire. Later that night, I lay on the roof of my van, wrapped in a blanket, watching the stars come out one by one until the entire sky was glowing. It felt like the world had gone completely still.

The next morning, I woke up to the sound of seagulls and the salty breeze coming through my window. I made a cup of coffee, sat on the edge of the cliff, and just soaked it all in. It was pure magic, the kind of night that makes van life so worth it.

1mz1b3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mz1b3u/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Reveal if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by Keurig Delivers,"The Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial coffee maker is the kind of device that makes me question how I ever managed mornings without it. As someone who lives on caffeine, this coffee maker has been a game-changer for both my personal and professional life. It effortlessly brews coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and even iced beverages, all under one minute. I‚Äôve been using it daily, and let me tell you, it brings a whole new level of convenience and customization.

**Interactive Touch Screen: Modern Simplicity**

This coffee maker's touchscreen is a fantastic feature that makes brewing feel futuristic. A bright, full-color touchscreen allows me to adjust the brew temperature, choose from settings in English, Spanish, or French, and even schedule an auto on/off time. I programmed it to kickstart my brewing just as I walk into the kitchen every morning. It's intuitive and responds incredibly quickly. Plus, let‚Äôs be honest, the sleek and modern interface easily impresses guests in my office.

**Brew Sizes and Beverage Variety: Everyone‚Äôs Happy**

One of my favorite aspects is the flexibility of the brew sizes. Whether I need a quick 4 oz. caffeine shot or a more leisurely 10 oz. cup to sip while working on emails, this machine has me covered. And it‚Äôs not just about coffee! The Keurig K155 excels with hot chocolate and even iced tea during those warmer months. My coworkers love the variety, and I can customize drinks to suit every mood‚Äîor craving.

[Grab Keurig K155 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b00dwkehu4/)

**Large Removable Water Reservoir: Less Hassle**

The 90-ounce water reservoir is a dream. I don‚Äôt have to refill it every day unless my office gets hit with a coffee apocalypse. It‚Äôs massive enough to brew up to 18 cups, which is perfect for shared spaces or busy mornings when everyone is scrambling for caffeine. It‚Äôs also removable, so cleaning it or refilling is a straightforward, spill-free process.

**Build Quality and Design: Sleek Meets Practicality**

The metallic silver finish elevates this coffee maker beyond a mere appliance‚Äîit genuinely feels stylish. It looks right at home in any kitchen or office, complementing its surroundings instead of sticking out like an industrial machine. At 6 pounds, it‚Äôs solidly built yet portable enough for when you want to rearrange counter space.

**Winning Points**

- The 90-ounce reservoir ensures fewer interruptions for refills.
- A sleek LCD touchscreen adds a modern and accessible touch.
- Options for four brew sizes allow for personalized drinks.
- Fully programmable features, including auto-on/off settings, save time.
- Versatility for coffee, tea, cocoa, and even iced beverages.

**Caveats**

- It doesn‚Äôt come with a reusable coffee pod out of the box, so you need to invest separately if you want to brew with your own grounds.
- The 4 oz. option can sometimes feel too small unless you specifically prefer super-concentrated coffee.
- As advanced as it is, it‚Äôs not the quietest machine out there, particularly during the brewing process.

**Competing Brands**

When put side by side with similar single-serve brewers, the Keurig K155 holds its ground remarkably well. Comparing it to the Cuisinart SS-10, which also features a touch screen and temperature adjustments, Keurig edges ahead with its larger water reservoir and broader language settings. However, the slightly higher noise level places it a step behind the quieter Nespresso VertuoPlus machine. Still, Nespresso doesn‚Äôt offer the kind of variety that Keurig does‚Äîhot chocolate and iced options make the K155 more versatile. 

If durability is your main concern, Keurig‚Äôs metallic finish and comprehensive draining options for water storage provide an edge against machines like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which feels lighter in build quality.

**Smart Spending**

When assessing its features against similar products, the Keurig K155 justifies its price point well. It‚Äôs practically designed for those who want convenience without sacrificing functionality. While it might not be the cheapest option available, its combination of programmable features, beverage versatility, and impressive brew speed ensure you‚Äôre paying for something worthwhile for both home and office environments.

I prefer relatively dark-roasted coffee beans for espresso, but not oily, black ones. Would Lazzio Dark be too dark for my taste?

I was driving through a remote stretch of highway in Montana when I suddenly realized my GPS had completely lost signal. No cell service, no Wi-Fi, no friendly voice telling me where to turn next. For a few minutes, I‚Äôll admit, I panicked. I had no idea where the nearest campground was, and night was creeping in fast.

After about twenty minutes of driving aimlessly, I spotted a tiny dirt road and decided to follow it, hoping it would lead me somewhere safe to park for the night. What I didn‚Äôt expect was to stumble upon a hidden little lake surrounded by pine trees, with just enough space to back in my RV. There wasn‚Äôt another soul around, no lights, no noise, just silence and the sound of the water.

I set up a small fire, made myself a cup of coffee, and sat outside watching the sun set over the lake. It was one of those quiet moments where you suddenly realize why you chose this life. No crowded campgrounds, no city noise, no rush. Just peace.

The next morning, I woke up to the sound of birds and the smell of fresh pine. I even spotted a family of deer grazing nearby. It felt like a scene out of a movie. I eventually found my way back to the main road later that day, but honestly, part of me didn‚Äôt want to leave.

1mz18oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mz18oe/should_you_choose_the_chefman_electric_kettle/,Should You Choose the Chefman Electric Kettle RJ11-17-CTI-RL? Read This Review,"The **Chefman RJ11-17-CTI-RL Electric Kettle** quickly became a staple in my kitchen, and honestly, it‚Äôs hard to imagine life without it now. Boiling water has never been this precise or fast, and for a tea enthusiast like me, that‚Äôs an absolute game changer. The kettle is especially useful if you‚Äôre juggling multiple tasks or simply enjoy a perfectly brewed cup of tea every time. I‚Äôve tested it over a couple of weeks, and while it‚Äôs undoubtedly impressive, there are a few quirks that are worth pointing out.

**Design and Build Quality**  
If aesthetics matter to you, this kettle ticks the right boxes. Made of clear glass and stainless steel, its modern and sleek design fits seamlessly into any kitchen setup. The glass body lets you see the water level and boiling process, with color-coded LED lighting making it visually engaging. There‚Äôs just something satisfying about watching water come to a boil through the glass. However, it's not just about looks; it‚Äôs also practical. The 360-degree swivel base makes it super easy to place the kettle in any orientation, and the easy-grip handle ensures stability while pouring. It feels sturdy enough to last, and the materials used are BPA-free, adding that extra reassurance for health-conscious buyers.

**Temperature Control Precision**  
The standout feature has got to be the variable heat settings. With seven temperature presets ranging from 160¬∞F to 212¬∞F, you can brew anything from delicate green tea to a robust black coffee without over-steeping. Whenever I want to channel my inner barista‚Äîor tea sommelier‚Äîthis feature shines. The adjustable settings are simple to use thanks to the ergonomically placed buttons on the base. Pairing it with the tri-color LED lights that indicate the different modes is just icing on the cake. That said, the buttons are touch-sensitive rather than tactile, and I had to get used to their responsiveness, especially when my hands were damp after washing dishes.

**Boil Time and Convenience**  
Speed is where this kettle excels. Boiling a full pot of water‚Äîup to its 1.8-liter capacity‚Äîtakes roughly 3-5 minutes, much quicker than my old stovetop kettle. For smaller amounts, it‚Äôs even faster. I‚Äôve used it for everything from instant noodles to pour-over coffee during busy mornings, and it never let me down. The cordless feature is also a massive pro here. Detaching it from its base is seamless, and you can carry it anywhere without worrying about cords getting tangled up. Whether you‚Äôre serving drinks on the patio or refilling your cup while working from home, it adds a touch of mobility that I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until now.

**Brewing Tea with the Removable Infuser**  
Including an infuser feels like a love letter to tea drinkers. It‚Äôs perfect for loose-leaf tea, allowing me to brew multiple cups in one go without messing around with individual infusers. Once steeping is done, the tea tastes balanced and full of flavor. I even stretched its use a bit by tossing in some herbal blends for cold brews‚Äîworked like a charm. Cleaning it was straightforward since the infuser can be easily taken out and rinsed. However, tiny leaves sometimes sneak through the sieve, so look out if you like very fine teas.

**Pluses**  
- The tri-color LED light system is both functional and visually appealing.  
- Boil-dry protection and auto shutoff features offer great peace of mind.  
- Enhanced mobility with a cordless design and 360-degree swivel base.  
- Stain-resistant materials make it easy to maintain a clean, polished look.  

**Pitfalls**  
- The lid is removable, which is great for cleaning, but it can be cumbersome since it doesn‚Äôt have a hinge to stay attached when refilled.  
- Touch-sensitive controls aren‚Äôt ideal for wet or soapy hands.  
- Although BPA-free, the glass can feel a bit fragile compared to kettles with entirely stainless-steel bodies.

**Competing Brands**  
This electric kettle finds itself in a crowded market. Brands like Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach also offer kettles with variable temperature settings and sleek designs. While I tested both of these alternatives in the past, I found the Chefman stands out in terms of boil speed and intuitive settings. That said, Cuisinart‚Äôs kettles sometimes offer slightly larger capacities and can cater to heavier tea drinkers or families. Hamilton Beach‚Äôs designs lean more budget-friendly but sacrifice both aesthetic appeal and some premium features like preset temperatures. Chefman cuts a balanced figure between affordability and performance, making it a valuable pick depending on your needs.

**Quality for Price**  
Looking at the range of features packed into this kettle, I‚Äôd say it more than justifies its price tag. The advanced safety features, variable temperature settings, and fast boiling time make it appealing to a broad audience, from casual tea drinkers to brewing enthusiasts. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option available, but the combination of convenience and quality it offers doesn‚Äôt feel overpriced. If you want something reliable and stylish that also performs exceptionally well, the investment seems reasonable.

1mz17rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/1mz17rb/shadowverse_wb_meta_report_august_24th/,Shadowverse WB Meta Report. August 24th. Speculative Edition.,"Greetings everyone and welcome to another Shadowverse Worlds Beyond meta report. We are 4 days away from the next set. So this report will be more speculative as the metagame will soon end and we are basically stuck in Limbo waiting. So there will be some educated guesswork as to how things might pan out during the first few days in the next set. Mostly for fun more than anything serious. 

A few things can be inferred though from a broader perspective. Looks like the omen part of the set could very well look to be up to 8 cards, with just 2 unrelated cards. Which would be the heaviest commitment to a theme yet if it turns out to be the case. But at the very minimum we are looking at at least 6 cards.

So let us take a relaxed stroll through things as we await the release of Heirs of the Omen


---

**Forestcraft**

*In a tranquil clearing in the Great woods of Forestcraft, where animals frolick beneath a gentle sun. Things quickly turn frosty, as a sudden chill sets across the entire Forest. Leaving Lovesign a bit confused. Titania explains that is the coming of the Omen of Unkilling, a bothersome thing. Lovesign wants to remark upon the name being a bit.. dumb. But something tells him that if he ever utters that thought out aloud, it will be the last thing he ever does. So he just nods like he takes it all seriously.*

With only one card revealed for Forestcraft, and not a legendary. We are left with few real clues as to what may come in the next set for Forestcraft except Unkilling likely continues its pattern on focusing on lowering the stats of enemy followers and gaining some synergies off that. But beyond that, guessing they're saving Forest for last at this point.

**[Roach Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cCQM.cCQM.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.cao2.cao2.cao2.capI.capI.capI.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cb2w.cb2w.cb2w.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czFM.czU-.czU-)**

A combo deck built around the roach. Roach Forest might be able to nab a few potential control tools off Unkilling. Using those to help stay alive as it builds towards its combo. Or it may just largely stay the same.  That said, it may see less play at the start as people try out all sorts of decks and more aggressive decks surge to try and exploit that particular period. 

**[Tempo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cYqk.cYqk.caY6.caY6.caY6.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cbG-.cbG-.cbG-.cxFE.cxFE.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czRs.czRs.czRs)**

A tempo deck built around Faeries and running down the opponent with them. Tempo Forests future looks less certain, it might be able to include some lower cost unkilling cards to provide some good disruption. But unless it gets something more in terms of threats. It may just stay at the lower rungs of the metagame or fall into the fringes of the metagame.

**Swordcraft**

*On a cold night in the great Fortress of Swordcraft. Albert is suddenly awakened by Maria, panicking about a sudden influx of loot and treasure. Having no idea where they could have come from. Albert once he wakes up properly realises what's going on and explains it is the return of Usurpation... And best to leave them alone because they are a funny bunch. Except Octrice, she's cool. *

Looking into the future for Sword with Usurpation. Besides a potential Usurpation Sword deck as i imagine they're trying their hardest the third time around utilizing all their experience from previous loot sword attempts. So i imagine Usurpation Sword will be a thing. But the downside to that is the rest of Sword has always struggled to make much use of Loot.. well outside of utilizing Octrice generally. This does have the advantage of being tougher to just slap on to Midrange Sword, but also means anything outside of that may also have a tougher time of it too. But, still plenty of cards to go, so who knows ?

**[Midrange Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cYqk.cYqk.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdU4.cdU4.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.c_Os.c_Os.c_u6.c_u6.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

A Midrange deck built around a variety of generally efficient followers with a focus on more expensive followers. The big question for many here is if Sinciro can be easily splashed in or if he will require a good amount of cards to actually work in the deck. Since midrange sword tends to want to just add in efficient standalone cards. So him requiring too much just renders him moot. That said, Octrice is likely to be an inclusion if she is anything like her previous versions. Otherwise i do expect a good amount of Midrange Sword at the start as some players will look to exploit the deck brewing period to just sneak in easy wins and climb fast for Grandmaster.

**[Aggro Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cEaA.cEaA.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cc-q.cc-q.cc-q.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cdjY.cdjY.cdjY.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

An Aggro deck built around fast and efficient threats. Tough to see how this might make use of the Usurpation cards unless there are some good aggressive ones and a way to generate enough Gilded blades, as collecting those could present an Aggro deck with some extra reach via burn damage to close out a match. But i'd not be surprised if Aggro Sword falls off if there isn't anything it can really use except maybe at the start of the new set.

**Runecraft**

*It's a soggy morning at Runecraft Academy with bustling students and faculty members carrying their coffee and breakfast to various buildings when Kaori spots what she thinks is a familiar figure. But he shouldn't be here. She breaks into a sprint, making sure not to drop her food and drink. While also ruining it for anyone who gets in her way. In the end she can't  find him, and the people who are upset about having their morning ruined are growing too numerous to ignore for Kaori .*

Truth be told. Truth has always been an awkward archetype in Runecraft, never really succeeding and mostly just either being a meme or an accessory to Spellboost. This time around they might have more of an actual plan (and enough cards in the set to maybe make it work) But how this will play out is anyones guess. never mind if any of the other runecraft archetypes might be able to make use of the cards. Spells most likely, followers ? Much tougher to say.

**[Hybrid Spellboost Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cH3E.cH3E.cH3E.cYqu.cfTk.cfTk.cfTk.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfgY.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfy-.cfy-.cfy-.cfz8.cfz8.cfz8.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cgCc.cgCc.cgCc.cxFE.d24k.d27s.d2NU.d2NU.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8)**

A Combo control deck built around spellboosting and earth rites. Depending on how Truth works out, the question here is if Hybrid just switches out Earth Rite for Truth. Since the way spellboost works at the moment, it doesn't even need that much spellboost to really work. Not with the power level of a certain few key cards. So it basically becomes a question if truth can work with it and whether it is better than Earth Rite, or at least just as good. I do expect people to experiment with it at least.

A Midrange deck built around Earth rites. A tough question of what Earth Rite will look like. Might be able to sneak in a few new followers and spells. But how that will turn out is an excellent question. I expect the deck will see play, but what share of the metagame it will take up, is another matter.

A midrange deck built around Spellboosting. If any of the new spells are good or there's a new spellboost card in the 10 cards. Maybe this deck will rise a bit in the next set. But i'd also not be surprised if it takes the backseat for a while again.

**Dragoncraft**

*It's never a quiet day in the Great mountain of Dragoncraft and Galan is really starting to feel it. As suddenly great claw marks are appearing all over the place, distinctive ones that seemingly burn. And Filene has gone into hiding, so she can't explain to him what is going on. And Forte just mentions a name ""Galmieux"" before running off as well. Galan starts to think that a holiday would be nice..*

The Return of Galmiuex promises potentially great things for Dragoncraft as her Archetype has been one of the consistently best performing out of the Omens. And with potentially even more cards. There's a good chance she'll provide a shot in the arm of the class with Aggro and Storm Ramp Dragon being the likely vessels for her archetype. I expect Dragon to be quite popular at the start as these will probably be some easily figured out archetypes to get swinging in the metagame with.

**[Storm Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.ciNg.ciNg.ciNg.cibk.cibk.cibk.cibu.cibu.cibu.cic2.cic2.cic2.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E)**

A Midrange deck built around ramping into big storm threats. Likely going to gain big on Galmiuex and her cards. That and Aggro Dragon. How exactly it will look is of course a tougher question. But so far the cards revealed have been very similar to old cards. So i'd not be surprised to see other staples return in a slightly polished fashion. So i'd expect the deck to get faster and meaner with better tempo tools to overwhelm the opponent with swiftly.

**[Fennie Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYLU.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMa.ciMa.cibk.cibk.cibk.cxFE.cxFE.d4HW.d4HW.d4HW.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.d50O.d50O.d50O)**

A midrange deck built around ramping fast into big threats.  Expecting it to probably adopt any potential control tools and Galmiuex herself. But considering Fennie tends to favour big cards and most of Disdain historically focuses on Smaller cards. There may be a mismatch here. That said, depending on how the meta turns out, Fennie Ramp may still find its place.

**Abysscraft**

*Within a plush bedroom within the horrifying Castle Abysscraft. Cerberus wakes up in a cold sweat. A nightmare that suddenly Mimi and momo where attached as heads on her shoulders and she was no longer the boss of the two but an equal. Though she only gets a few moments to shudder in horror as suddenly she hears Nio screaming from his bedroom. Perhaps he's had a similar bad dream? But whatever could be the cause of these ill-omened dreams ?.*

Heading into Hears of the Omen. Abysscraft looks relatively well positioned with the modal cards offering the class a fair amount of flexibility. Especially with the followers. And that is without even accounting for Sham-Nacha and her ability. So besides Entwining Abyss. I do expect Aggro Abyss and Midrange abyss to benefit from the set a fair bit. Control Abyss meanwhile may just become Entwining abyss.

**[Aggro Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.cYLU.cYLU.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckaI.ckaI.ckaI.ckoq.ckoq.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7D0.d7D0.d7D0)**

An aggro deck for abyss, all about getting in as much damage as fast as possible with a reasonable amount of burn damage to get the job done. While it'll be tough to determine which cards it may include, i do expect some to make their way into Aggro Abyss, which combined with people trying out new cards. Definitely has me thinking Aggro Abyss will be one of the more popular decks at the onset of the set. And depending on how well it can use the new cards, may remain so throughout the set.

**[Midrange Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.ckaI.ckaI.ckaI.ckoW.ckoW.ckoW.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d6zO.d6zO.d7D0.d7Se.d7Se.d7Se)**

A midrange deck built around more efficient mid-sized Abyss Followers. Expecting several of the new followers to make their way into the deck as they're both efficient and flexible. Something any midrange deck loves. Definitely expecting Midrange Abyss to benefit from the set.

**[Control Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ckYk.ckYk.ckaI.ckaI.ckoW.ckoW.ckoW.ckog.ckog.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl28.cl28.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d6zO.d6zO.d7SU.d7SU.d7SU.d7Se.d7Se.d7Se)**

A control deck built around grinding out the opponent and finishing them in the lategame. Expecting Control to become Entwining since Ginsetsu and Yuzuki becomes more of a win condition if both modes are activated at the same time. Plus Control Abyss is probably the deck that might be interested in the match going long enough to get that effect to trigger consistently.

**Havencraft**

*Dark clouds gather over the Cathedral city of Havencraft as a congregation suddenly advances through the main streets, preaching repose and despair. Aether doesn't know what's come about them and Esparanza just looks on a bit confused. Having no clue as to what is going on. Nor can they find anyone organizing any of this. And just a suddenly as the congregation appeared. It vanishes. Leaving the two with a very uncomfortable feeling.*

Repose and Despair is a bit of a tough one to judge. Especially as the gold amulet feels made for a Skullfane deck more than anything. So far it appears like an attritional control deck is being set up for overall. Though whether or not that can actually work out. Well that is a very good question that really depends on what the rest of the cards look like. It also begs the question as what happens to the rest of havencraft ?

**[Ward Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.c9hW.c9hW.c9hW.c9yY.cYeE.cYeE.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cm--.cm--.cn0i.cn0i.cnEw.cnEw.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cwl-.cwl-.cwl-.cxFE.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.d99s.d99s.d9Sc.d9Sc.d9uk.d9uk.d9uk.d9uu.d9uu.d9uu)**

A midrange deck built around Wards. Ward Haven looks like it will be in an awkward spot seeing as Repose and Ward so far has no cards in common. Though a few low cost wards could fix that. And who knows, maybe there are some inclusions that could be made that aren't as obvious. But it is tough to see where exactly Ward Haven goes.


**[Storm Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOc2.cOc2.cOc2.cYqk.cYqk.cmlq.cmlq.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cmoU.cmoU.cm_8.cm_8.cm_8.cn0Y.cn0Y.cn0Y.cnGA.cnGA.cnGA.cnGK.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cxFE.cxFE.d9PU.d9PU.d9PU.d9f6.d9f6)**

A midrange deck built around setting up big tempo swings with Amulets and big storm followers towards the end. Outside of a potential connection with the new amulet and Skullfane. Storm haven does look like it is in a tough spot going into the new set. And even that one potential connection is tenous. So the future of Storm/Amulet Haven is looking a bit shaky. that said, still plenty of cards to go, and all it takes is a card or two to turn things around. But for now, things do look very uncertain.

**Portalcraft**

*In the crimeridden streets of the Metropolis of Portalcraft City. Where the only law is the law of the strong. Dreizehn is on the hunt for the idendity of Eudie once more. This time hunting down someone claiming to be a part of ""Destruction"". But whenever Dreizehn catches up them, they're seemingly gone. Only leaving a small egg in their wake. After countless hours of this egg hunt she finally gives up and heads home. As this is clearly a waste of her time and energy..*

The situation for Portalcraft with destruction is a bit opaque. Because while the gameplan clearly involves destroying ones own cards. The actual gameplan for doing so is less clear. Normally destruction has been associated with puppets. But destruction also typically had more of an actual endgame. And so far this archetype has yet to show that. So it is tough to say where this actually leads. Nor how other decks like Artifact portal may even hope to maybe benefit from this.

**[Artifact Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cQn6.cQqE.cQqE.cQqE.cpBw.cpBw.cpBw.cpEu.cpEu.cpEu.cpRO.cpRO.cpUM.cpUM.cpUM.cpUW.cpUW.cpUW.cpgs.cpgs.cpgs.cphK.cphK.cphK.cpwe.cpwe.cpwo.cpwo.cpwo.dBdg.dBdg.dBdg.dBus.dBus.dBus.dC5M.dC5M.dC5M.dCL8.dCL8)**

A midrange deck built around artifacts. It's a tough one with Artifact Portal as it is a lot less clear how it might hope to benefit from this. In theory it could do something with the egg and artifacts that can't be destroyed by effects. But will that be any good? Lots of question, no good answers at the moment. So nothing to do but wait and see for the entire set to be revealed.

**[Puppet Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.c9hM.c9hM.c9hM.cQnG.cQnG.cQnG.cR2I.cR2I.cR2I.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.cYqk.cpC4.cpC4.cpC4.cpRO.cpRO.cpRO.cpRY.cpRY.cpRY.cpwU.cpwU.cpwU.cpwe.cpwe.cpwe.cwWM.cwWM.cwWM.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.dC8U.dC8U.dCK-.dCK-.dCK-)**

A Tempo/Midrange deck built around puppets. Could go full Destruction and that might be the initial path. But how will that exactly look. Still a sort of Tempo/midrange deck ? Where the destruction elements provide better tempo and burst damage ? It would be quite the departure from previous Destruction archetypes. But it feels like it might be the gameplan for now.

---

There we have it. Obviously far from anything serious, just general speculation as we still lack  a lot of cards. One thing i can say for certain though is that compared to Infinity evolved. A lot of the cards revealed so far have a lot more going for them with many more angles. Which makes them tougher to fully predict what they might do or connect with. There's definitely been a step up in overall design. So i think we'll be seeing a lot of surprises in the next set as people try out a variety of things.

That said, i also expect at the very start for some people to just jam the already good decks from Infinity evolved and take them as far as they can get before the new meta solidifies and counters appear. It's been a common thing in the past of the OG shadowverse and i am very much expecting to see it here. So i'd be careful about assuming too much about the meta in the first day or two. As a lot of things can happen over just a few days at the start of a new metagame. Especially when there are cards that actually allow for it.

1mz16ud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz16ud,"US 1996 RCW, A Review","Shout-out to Mike Kreisher for this generous gift, my 1st experience with a RCW or, Ration, Cold Weather. These are the precursors to today's modern MCWs, or, Meal, Cold Weather. Honestly, I think the RCWs are better!

Bear with me, this is basically a combined 24 hr ration, so lots of pics and thoughts.

These come in sets of two, with a set considered a day's worth of food. This is the set for Menu 1, 1A and 1B. 

There is a lot going on in these and a very nice diversity of snacks and treats!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents. Note the design is very similar to today's modern MCWs.

Pic 4 shows a 29 year old Tootsie Roll and hot cocoa with the non-dairy creamer added. Very slight rancidity in the roll, but a deep chocolatey goodness as well that easily masked the rancid element. The hot cocoa was rich, creamy, and very pleasant. Called for 3/4 cup of water but I used 2/3 cup. I think that was the right call. Very rich flavor that way and maybe the best cocoa I've ever had from a ration. 

Pic 5 shows the cup of soup.  Imagine my surprise when I popped open the black and white packaging to find a simple Lipton Cup O Soup. Was in perfect condition and quite pleasant!

Pic 6 shows the Tasters Choice, Red Edition. As you can see, it went straight to the garbage as it appeared moldy. This was not surprising as these are often found this way with this particular coffee.

Pics 7-8 show the Strawberries and Cream Oatmeal dry in the original bag and then reconstituted with hot water. This was fantastic.  Great creamy texture, large portion, nice level of sweetness, good Strawberry flavor! Don't understand why this isn't in modern MCWs tbh.

Pic 9 is the crackers. Just regular old MRE crackers. I added a MRE chunky PB after taking this pic. No complaints!

Pic 10 shows the blueberry bars. Think Fig Newtons, just blueberry. These were definitely past their prime, but I ate all of them. Decent blueberry flavor, crunchy bits on the ends, sweet, but just a little off as well. Probably fantastic 29 years ago!!

Pic 11 is the apple cider. Had very high hopes for this based on the aroma and initial sips, but the more  I drank, the more I realized it was bad. Couldn't finish it. 

Pic 12 shows the fairy dust, which, in this case, was a powdered bag of rancid M&Ms. I did eat an intact, swollen blue one, and it was so bad. There was no salvaging these.

Pic 13 shows the mixed nuts with what is supposed to be raisins. Obviously the raisins have sort of liquefied and resolidified as a sort of gross sticky mass at the top of the bag. This was vacuum sealed, so they were under considerable pressure.  Alas, these nuts were rancid as well and I could not eat more than a couple before my spidey senses were tingling telling me to stop.

Pic 14 shows the compressed bars, one oatmeal and one granola. These, back in the day, were probably amazing for sure!!! But now, the taste and enjoyment were short lived as a slight rancid flavor crept in on the backend of each bite. I powered through and finished both bars, but they were clearly not 100% ok.

Pic 15 shows the 2 Cold beverages provided. Lemon iced tea and Orange beverage base. Wanna take a guess which is which? I can assure you, the only reason u can tell is most likely due to the camera flash as these were both a gross brown color.  The lemon tea tasted ok and was super lemony with a very tart taste. The orange base, the one on the right,  smelled so bad I didn't even taste it. A shame really. 

Pic 16 shows a gorgeous chocolate covered cookie. Again, hopes were quickly dashed as the rancid smell was obvious.  Did try a bite and immediately reached a conclusion that this would have been magnificent about 25 years ago, but was not edible in current state. Such a beautiful shiny cookie!

Pics 17 and 18 show the beef stew. That plastic bag is what it comes in inside the main bag. You get a 2nd cardboard thing that goes on top and allows you to twist the bag and pull it through so the whole package can go back into the main  bag to rehydrate. This beef stew was amazing!!! 100% perfect. So much better than modern US MRE beef stew. Check out the ingredients label on that beef stew,  crazy that we dont have this stuff all over in stores everywhere. 

The gum was actually very minty and refreshing too!

I have a mid 70s LRP beef stew to try as well. Will be neat to compare them! Shout-out to SirG2020 for that hook-up!

In conclusion, this was a great experience! Back in the day, these would have been top notch provisions for our troops!

O Starobrnu rikam cely zivot, ze se vyrabi svazenim nedopitych piv z brnenskych hospod a podle stupne kvaseni se to osvezi Sodastreamem. V pivovaru byla jedina vyjimka, kde se to dalo pit. Dodnes. Uz fakt ani tam ne. Jsem opravdu sklamany. Myslim, ze to musi prodavat do hospod za dumpingove ceny nebo jejich obchodni reditel je vlastne genius.

Obecne - Brno jede! Je videt hodne jerabu a ze se stavi. A jak rika Adam Gebrian, koukejte na jeraby. Pokud ve meste nejsou, mesto stagnuje. To v Brne evidentne nehrozi!

V Brne to zije. Na kazdem namesti neco. Akorat, kdyby namesti a ulice mohli mluvit ci projevovat emoce, tak prostranstvi u Janackova divadla bude brecet.

Lehatkove posezeni na Svobodaku a Moravaku je top, skoda jen, ze par tech zidli zabiral krabicakem posilneny vagus, ale to je osud asi kazdeho mesta.

My iron at the end of 2024 was dancing just a handful of points above the low lines, all iron levels. At the time I was recommended to take 25mg daily Iron Glycinate (and to follow up with a PCP for thyroid issues). 

Flashforward to now, thinking I've done myself a solid by religiously taking the supplement: nope, it's actually lower than before! They're all now dancing just a few points above the low lines. Que PCP docs saying ""everything is fine, you're in range"". 

I realized pretty late I wasn't taking it super appropriately. I used to put all my supplements into a lil daily cup and slam it down and chase it with breakfast and lots of water, sometimes with coffee. I recently switched up its timing to take it away from all possible blockers and to taking it with lemonade the last 4 weeks.

Im also coming to terms that my menorrhagia menstrual cycle is probably my biggest perpetrator in this issue in why I can't get it to climb. The second is I've pretty much stopped eating dark leafy greens due to getting this crazy backpain/seemingly kidney pain + nausea the following morning after eating said greens. I sometimes get that pain from taking regular supplements too late before bed. It seems if I take any of that early enough I can tolerate it, but within 4 hours of bed I'll be in pain the next day for a few hours. Though sometimes it'd happen midday too!

I've told this to several doctors and they have shrugged it off no matter how hard I push/advocate, because I also have scoliosis and say it's just muscle pain. I managed to get one to do a kidney stone scan, and it was clean. This problem doesn't come up as much staying away from that kind of stuff but I crave it pretty bad. 

So in the mean time, what types of irons are y'all taking? Is Glycinate a good choice and maybe I should just take two a day instead (50mg elemental)?

Btw happy to report my TSH has dropped by half, it's around 2.58 on a 0.45-4.5 range but what's strange to me is that my T3 and T4 didn't change at all, exact same numbers as before starting meds.

I made coffee, sat on the roof of my van, and just watched the world wake up. No cars, no noise, no cell signal just me, my rig, and nature doing its thing. Moments like this are why I chose van life. 

Anyone else ever stumbled onto an unplanned spot that completely blew you away?",4,1756054946.0,VanLife,0,0.83,False

Most important is, I hope that you‚Äôre enjoying this beautiful Sunday!

So I‚Äôm taking my last few sips of this freshly made delicious Italian coffee and realizing summer is almost gone‚Ä¶ believe it or not, I have yet to step a foot in the beach. Sad! I know lol. 

Well, the way I see it, with fall / Autumn almost around, I‚Äôd love to make a new bestie! I don‚Äôt have lots of high expectations but it will be awesome if you got some good humor, witty, can keep the conversation alive beyond the first three messages (yeah, not exaggerating lol), confident, professional, educated, charming (why not?), and most importantly, enthusiastic, in general lol. 

I mean, we can converse a while on here or snp, telgrm. Otherwise, I really look forward to connecting and hearing all about you, your stories, whatever you like to share‚Ä¶ ready for your pumpkin spice latte? Jk! Haha.
Well could even become gym motivation/accountability partners if you wish! Haha. 

What I‚Äôm def not looking for is to sign up for anyone‚Äôs only fs, follow anyone anywhere and def not on instgm.. and no, I have zero intentions to get in your pants! 

But you do have to tell me if you like any of the followings for a starter; üòä

Did you learn anything interesting in the sermon? Was there a verse that stood out to you? Did a song resonate with you? Did God lay anything cool on your heart? Was there a snack at coffee hour that

stole the show?

Post about it here!

If you aren't the sort to go to church, that's fine too! Feel welcome to share anything neat from your spiritual walk this past week.

I am looking for something casual, hopefully more than once. I'm 6', 200, clean shaven, do not drink or smoke, still have 2/3 of my graying black hair, very respectful and respect all limits. Sexually I am very very oral and love going down for as long as my partner wants me too. Besides that my equipment is very very thick, cut, mushroom head, groomed and it lasts. ED is not an issue with me. In terms of my sexually appetite, I am wide open but it takes two to tango so you will have to tell me what your limits are and what arouses you too.  
  
Obviously meeting for casual it is about orgasms, great conversation and smiles. This is about fun for you and for me. I want you wet, aroused and having fun as I am not a male who is selfish in bed,  
  
Geographically, I am on Long Island but can host at a motel or travel. I am not pushy so even if you contact me do not expect me to badger you to meet in a day. If or when you are ready to meet me you will tell me. Our first meeting can be for coffee and to talk. Or if you want we can just go for it but that is your decision.¬†

So, here I am, trying to find friends (or hopefully a friend group to join) living in the STL area. I want to prioritize friendship and be part of peoples' support systems, as I think a lot of us are very detached from each other and have no sense of community.

I am a goth/metalhead, and I love getting involved in local scenes. I am a thrifter/DIYer, and I love horror movies, reading, playing board/video games (and DnD), cooking/baking, and exercising (biking, power lifting, hiking, etc.). My work is in health equity, and I am very progressive and keep up with current politics. I would love to find people to grab coffee, explore the STL food scene, go to the zoo/museums and local shows, dominate the Touch Tunes at a dive bar, and watch bad movies at home.

1mz0y7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1mz0y7c/help_me_choose/,Help Me Choose!,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm in the market for a new coffee machine, upgrading from a Nespresso Vertuo Next. I‚Äôm in the UK and my upper budget is ¬£1000 (but of course the less money required to spend is always better!), but I‚Äôm really on the fence about what to purchase based on watching and reading lots of reviews across the internet. 

Originally, I was looking at the Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro, but after chatting to my partner who wants something a bit simpler, we‚Äôve decided a Superautomatic would be better for our household. 

Neither of us drinks a lot of coffee, but we like the coffee we do drink to be **nice**, which is why we want to move out of the Nespresso ecosystem and start purchasing actual beans from our favourite places. 

Currently, I‚Äôm toying with the Elette Explore, as I‚Äôm liking the cold foam options - my partner loves an iced coffee - and different amount of drinks available, and reviews I‚Äôve seen are very positive, however what‚Äôs the quality of the actual coffee like (assuming decent beans are used)?

Similarly, I see a lot of people recommending Jura, but this isn‚Äôt a brand I know a lot about, so reviews or opinions from UK-based Jura users would be welcome in terms of reliability, maintenance and service options etc. I see Currys stock Jura, but I see lots of people loving the brand and lots of people saying less-than-favourable things about them too, so not sure on this one. 

We would mainly be making milk-based drinks as neither of us (currently) drinks black coffee and would ideally like something with an easy-to-use interface allowing us to customise our drinks to get the best out of the beans and to tweak to our tastes, as neither of us are anywhere near coffee experts, but want to get better and explore.

Also, I would like something that looks smart and nice on the worktop - I‚Äôm a tech/gadget lover, so anything that looks sleek and has a great interface is always a plus, but of course coffee quality always comes first here.  

Any opinions and help welcome - I‚Äôm very close to pulling the trigger now, but just holding off for a little longer until I can get some advice or help! ",2,1756054684.0,superautomatic,9,0.75,False

Nag pamass hiring sila kahapon *sat* and ang daming applicants so sabay sabay yon, hanggang ngayon sobrang dissappointed padin ako sa nangyari hays. So sabay sabay na interview initial and final, so nakikita ko habang nakapila ako sa labas ang mga natitira sa loob na applicant mga matangkad and mat itsura so di ko muna pinansin yon. Tapos nung time na turn na namin nga mga kasabayan ko meron ako kasabayan na dalawang matangkad and 3 kami na maliliit, bale 5 kami sa table and sabay sabay na interview. Naririnig ko sila syempre ang ganda ng sagot ng dalawa kong kasama na maliit and isa dun fluent pa sa english, tapos yung kasama naman namin na matangkad yung isa medyo simple lang yung sagot and yung isa naman medyo alanganin. Tapos ang dami nilang tanong and ang gagaling ng mga kasama kong sumasagot maliban dun sa isang matangkad, kase yung isa pwede na eh parang nagdedefend ng thesis ganun. So saakin naman iniexpect ko na okay din naman sagot ko direct to the point talaga and medyo fluent naman ako mag english and also almost 4 years akong ang work sa isang coffee shop so may pag asa na mapili ako and then eto na hanggang sa natapos na yung interview, sinabi saming lima natatawagan nalang daw kami tapos nung palabas na kami nag senyas yung isang nag iinterview dun sa dalawang matangkad and narinig ko na for final inrerview sila.

1mz0uj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1mz0uj2/joia_rose_hall_iberostarjamaica_resort_review/,JOIA Rose Hall Iberostar-Jamaica Resort Review,"2 adults, couple, 32F, 37M. Just came back from a week here staying in 6331 a tropical view room without butlers and I give it a soft 4/5. I‚Äôll break down the rating below. 

Safety- never felt unsafe on the grounds even with the sales people on the beach. They were a nuisance but never rude/rowdy/engaging in dangerous behaviour. 

Spa-spa ladies would walk around offering services with a menu. We didnt partake but it was quite pricey compared to Canadian prices and I‚Äôm in a HCOL area. 

Food- if you‚Äôre not going early for dinner expect a wait between 15mins to 1 hour. We honestly never ate anything that was terrible while here, I‚Äôve been to the Cuba, Mexico and the DR multiple times and this was the first Jamaica trip. I put the food right next to Mexico. We ate at the Galleon steakhouse 3/7 nights (medium rare tenderloin was always perfection!) Toscana 1 night , the Italian in the Iberostar selections another night, Teppanyaki 1 other night and the buffet for gala night. Teppanyaki gets a bad rep on here I‚Äôve seen but the food itself was good, show was decent, only the crowd eating with us was low energy. Every single lunch we ate at the beach to get great jerk chicken and pork + small patties. One note if you‚Äôre not there early you could end up with just fries. We did dabble into the buffet at the beach for some other Jamaican fare for lunches. Breakfast buffet is good, there are 2 omelette stations and a waffle/pancake/french toast/crepe station. I will say if you‚Äôre picky with food you‚Äôll get bored of the breakfast by day 4. Coffee was always delicious and if Starbucks style drinks are more your thing then Star Cafe is probably where you want to start your day. They make lattes and mochas and a wide variety of flavoured coffees + liqueur coffees as well. They have gluten free and vegan options for all restaurants so that‚Äôs a bonus though the menu is limited and on one of the nights the restaurant didn‚Äôt have it available. 

Room service- we only ordered once on our last night at 5pm. We got spicy wings and pepperoni pizza. Order came in 35 minutes and both items were hot. No complaints there. 

Staff- staff were generally nice and not irritable with any of our requests and would greet us while we walked by them in the hallways. We always made sure to tip everyone that helped us or served us in any way. Housekeeping got a large tip the first day and smaller tips the rest of the week, we also would always tip the mini fridge as it‚Äôs my understanding separate people handle that. On the beach or the pools you can get service to your spot with the app. Some umbrella numbers at the beach weren‚Äôt active but we‚Äôd just leave a note with the spot we were at. Always friendly staff. Entertainment staff were always energetic and engaging and most of the cooking staff also were nice. EXTRA BIG SHOUT OUT TO BELLHOP MICHAEL HOOKING US UP WITH KFC. we heard KFC in Jamaica was amazing and so we needed to try some. We weren‚Äôt interested in going to whitter village (50usd roundtrip + the cost of the food and an hour wait in line) and Michael got it delivered for us through a food delivery friend. 

Critters- we didn‚Äôt see a single roach in the rooms or buildings (it‚Äôs the tropics and sometimes that happens, they‚Äôre around). We did see some bats and they did leave a little poop on the balcony but nothing making it totally unusable. There were some lizards on the walls outside but never inside. Wasps would hang at the pink flowers near the lounge beds but wouldn‚Äôt sting you. In the early mornings fish are at the beach and crabs are scuttling around. At night there are some mosquitos by the beach and there are definitely roaches by the pool shows. 

Pool/beach- there are 4 pools all connected but without access to each other  at JOIA. You do get access to the other two resorts beside. We didn‚Äôt go over to Waves other than one walk down to the pier which was ruined by several beach hustlers (again to be expected but can be a nuisance, we couldn‚Äôt even walk the pier because they folllwed us). The JOIA pools were all nice, clean and relatively quiet. We did spend a lot of our time in the lazy river at selections and playing on the swing over there. The beach does have some seagrass but no sargassum that is plaguing the rest of the Caribbean. There is ample clean beach without grass that you can go out and float or swim around and sometimes see small fish. One large complaint is still just the hustlers. I‚Äôve experienced this at almost all AI‚Äôs I‚Äôve been to but by day 3 when you keep telling the same person you‚Äôre not interested it gets a little irritating.  They would remain friendly and cheerful and not overly pushy but would continue to offer us to view their wares. Ample chairs and lounge beds at the beach and pool, never had a problem finding a spot and again you can get service at the chairs which is a bonus. There‚Äôs a hammock on the beach but located in the center so you‚Äôre on display if you use it lol. 

Time share breakfast- not our first rodeo. We got invited to what would be a hard sell breakfast for the timeshares. We didn‚Äôt show up and when they called to ask if we were interested we said no and they didn‚Äôt bother us or treat us differently. I‚Äôve had a poor experience at Bahia where they harassed me for multiple days all day to try and get me to their timeshare presentation, including coming to the pool to ask for me to ‚Äútake a small tour‚Äù. 

Room- rooms are spacious and bed was fairly comfy. We had one large king size bed and it was clean. No bed bugs and no stains. The tv wasn‚Äôt a smart tv but had an okay amount of channels, you‚Äôre spending most of the time outside anyways, said there were options to cast but we couldn‚Äôt get it to work. The lower area has a step down to the sitting area with a chaise lounge and table and then your balcony with a very nice and cozy two person swing. The bathroom has a shower, a jacuzzi tub with bath salts and separate toilet area. There are his and hers sinks, two robes, sandals and a hair dryer. No complaints and we saw no mildew or mould. Though our cabinet which housed the mini bar was misaligned and would open randomly on its own. I wouldnt recommend a tropical view unless you want complete silence while sleeping during the day, the view left a lot to be desired. We could see the ocean but we‚Äôd get a smelly draft sometimes and could look down at the people below. Not a dealbreaker if you‚Äôre not spending much time in your room. 

Housekeeping- housekeeping was great and very friendly though sometimes inconsistent. Could have been the app notifications being inconsistent but they would alert you when your room was being cleaned/ready. Sometimes our room would get cleaned once and sometimes multiple times? Not sure if that was an app error or they were coming in multiple times. If you‚Äôre into your bed being made everytime you leave then you‚Äôd love this. Floors were always clean and toiletries restocked. 

Entertainment- there‚Äôs a club that‚Äôs popular, nightly events and shows/karaoke that are hit or miss depending on your tastes and they all start at 9/9:30. The resort beside has a Mario kart tournament (if you like gaming). There are outdoor activities like cornhole, volleyball, ping pong. ONE NOTE: water sports aren‚Äôt free. Some things cost money but are advertised as all included. Small catamaran rides if you can‚Äôt sail yourself are 30$usd a person to have a guide with you. This was the first resort where the guide coming wasn‚Äôt free and then you tip them. Kayaks and snorkel gear was available and same with diving classes. There were some shops with clothes and souvenirs and a fancier bar and small casino. A classic white party on Friday nights. The lobby classical artists and singers were always very talented and a pleasure to listen to while winding down for dinner. We watched Aqua Ballet which was pretty good but we ended up going inside after some roaches were flying around, again it‚Äôs the tropics but I didn‚Äôt want a big roach landing on me after having just showered for the evening. 

Drinks- good variety, actually strong drinks unlike my experience in Mexico. Specialty drinks on their menus and beachside service. The main bars would allow you to pick your liquor and only ultra premium brands still cost extra if you want them or if you wanted bottles. 

Resort as a whole and grounds- grounds were kept nice and tidy. We always saw workers improving things. Inside is colonial style. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs super dated but if you‚Äôre looking for a Hilton type modernized resort that‚Äôs not what this will look like though still higher end for an AI. No sketchy people were around and lots of security along the walls and there‚Äôs a gate to enter. Carpet could be removed from the hallways to prevent mildew smells BUT there‚Äôs an air freshener that pumps a smell into everywhere. It smells pleasant but if your rooms in front of it you might get gassed out. 

Tipping- we tipped everyone who helped us or served us anything. Larger tips at sit down dinners and smaller tips at the buffet plus we would tip our breakfast staff that would make eggs or crepes. Tipping housekeeping, bellhops, mini bar, for all drinks and at the cafe etc. We saw a lot of people not tipping which was strange but to each their own. Again never expected but always an appreciated gesture. 

Check in- nice and quick, efficient and no pressure for upgrades. No welcome drink but that doesn‚Äôt bother me. In the room within 10 minutes after arrival. 

Not a 5/5 because I believe nowhere is perfect. Sticking with a soft 4 stars due to all the things above. Some improvements could be made with updating rooms to be more modern (I don‚Äôt mind the colonial style). Removing carpet in the hallways to avoid mildew smell. Welcome drinks, more breakfast options and slightly less hustlers on the beach.

These are not deal-breakers, but here's a list of things opponents do a lot that seem to me to be snotty ways to play Arena. I wonder if any of you all have your own pet peeves.

1. Concede at the last minute when they know they're going to lose. If I'm on my last legs and it's apparent my opponent is going to beat me on that turn, I let him. It seems to be a simple little courtesy to let the winner's deck do it's thing.

2. Concede a couple of turns in when a basic combo of mine comes off, or I bring in a card that they're scared of. We haven't even really started developing. Let's give our decks a chance to unfold a bit. I get it if you're mana hosed. But if you didn't take a mulligan when your first draw had one or two slow lands, that's on you. 

3. Suddenly slow-play when it's apparent they're going down. We've been playing at a good clip, no time-outs, rolling along. Then I have a couple of good turns and suddenly my opponent had to wander off to get a coffee. It's almost like they expect me to get frustrated and quit so they get the win. 

4. Spam ""your go"" repeatedly when I spend an extra 10 seconds reading a card they just played or considering my next steps. Instant mute.

5. It's obviously the last turn, they're going to kill me. I'm tapped out, creatures all tapped, no cards in hand.

1mz0t2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1mz0t2s/tmi_i_havent_been_able_to_complete_most_of_my/,TMI: I haven‚Äôt been able to complete most of my long run this training block because I have to üí© halfway though my run.,"TMI post, no details, just what‚Äôs happening. **I have had enough!** I don‚Äôt know what to do about this anymore and I know I‚Äôm not the only one that has to be dealing with this.

I am back from another incomplete run where I was screaming in my car out of frustration from not completing yet again another long run but also *serious discomfort* that had me in tears. I literally couldn‚Äôt even stretch after. I just hopped into my car sweaty as hell, screaming, annoyed, frustrated, peeled out of the parking lot to get home as fast as possible. I barely could make it through the door.

This is one of those ‚Äúif you know you know‚Äù situations where a park bathroom is not the right setting and neither is a porta potty.

**I don‚Äôt know what to do!** I try drinking coffee when I get up. I try eating healthy. I try drinking water. My body just does not like me during my second marathon training block. It doesn‚Äôt help I have IBS either so yeah‚Ä¶ 

Luckily I have built a training plan that has the ability to be changed. This is now the 5th incomplete run this block. I was supposed to run a 14 one time that didn‚Äôt happen, a 15 and 16 that didn‚Äôt happen, and now last week I was supposed to run a 18 mile and I couldn‚Äôt because the same thing so I pushed my week back again to accommodate the 18 mile this week and I couldn‚Äôt do it either. All these have been stopped around the 13 mile mark. So at least I‚Äôm getting in 13 miles but *I NEED THOSE EXTRA MILES!* With the recent heat I have barely even been able to take down my gels either. I feel like I am just falling apart this block.

Luckily, my weekly schedule is constantly being met with no issues. 6, 7, 9, 6, and long runs on weekends. Was trying to hit 50 miles a week for at least 5 weeks. My first I only hit 43 max 3 weeks before and I know I needed to run more to improve upon that. Thank god though for the past 5 weeks I have been able to hit 42 miles consecutively so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not racking in miles, I‚Äôm just now neglecting those miles on my long run.

I‚Äôm running the MCM in DC at the end of October so I still have time to make up those missed miles I should be doing now. It is now just getting slightly concerning between not being able to run my full length runs and not being able to get my gels down sometimes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like lowkey very worried. 

I know I‚Äôm freaking out but I‚Äôm had enough of this.

Can I get some advice please?! üò≠

1mz0qit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mz0qit/hinge_dates/,Hinge dates,"I (25M) feel a bit confused about the way the early game dating has been going through hinge. Over the last few months i have met three really great girls on the apps that i texted with for awhile and had first dates with that seemed like they went well, but all three of the girls immediately weren‚Äôt interested after the date was over. In all of the cases, we were texting every day for 3ish weeks before the date, conversation was flowing during, and then completely dead after. Either got ghosted or they just responded dryly and dodged future plans. It sucks because i was truly interested in continuing to get to know each of them and there seemed to be mutual effort both over text and in those conversations. I think there may be some vibe that I might be giving off in person that im unconscious of, and i‚Äôm very curious to know what it is but obviously it‚Äôd be kind of weird to ask them directly for that kind of feedback.

To this point, all serious relationships that i have had in my life came from being friends first and then eventually lovers. I think it‚Äôs easier that way bc you already did the ‚Äúget to know you‚Äù stage and immediately have chemistry. Ive also had success meeting girls in bars, parties, etc but it led to nothing more than maybe a hookup or short fling. I have had no experience of going on a formal first date with somebody im meeting in person for the first time and it turning into something real. I feel like these days, unless i want to join some club or go to bars and other social settings with the sole purpose of hoping to bump into somebody i‚Äôm interested in, getting better at these first hinge dates is an important skill if i want to eventually be in a relationship. I‚Äôm curious to know if any of you have advice on trying to find out/understand the first impressions you give off or any advice on how to be better on first dates. Not only does it feel kind of like a waste of energy to text and get to know somebody for weeks just for it to turn into a quick coffee or dinner date and nothing after, but it‚Äôs also a bummer because i really did like these girls and i just want to know where i went wrong.",1,1756054175.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Nag pamass hiring sila kahapon *sat* and ang daming applicants so sabay sabay yon, hanggang ngayon sobrang dissappointed padin ako sa nangyari hays. So sabay sabay na interview initial and final, so nakikita ko habang nakapila ako sa labas ang mga natitira sa loob na applicant mga matangkad and mat itsura so di ko muna pinansin yon. Tapos nung time na turn na namin nga mga kasabayan ko meron ako kasabayan na dalawang matangkad and 3 kami na maliliit, bale 5 kami sa table and sabay sabay na interview. Naririnig ko sila syempre ang ganda ng sagot ng dalawa kong kasama na maliit and isa dun fluent pa sa english, tapos yung kasama naman namin na matangkad yung isa medyo simple lang yung sagot and yung isa naman medyo alanganin. Tapos ang dami nilang tanong and ang gagaling ng mga kasama kong sumasagot maliban dun sa isang matangkad, kase yung isa pwede na eh parang nagdedefend ng thesis ganun. So saakin naman iniexpect ko na okay din naman sagot ko direct to the point talaga and medyo fluent naman ako mag english and also almost 4 years akong ang work sa isang coffee shop so may pag asa na mapili ako and then eto na hanggang sa natapos na yung interview, sinabi saming lima natatawagan nalang daw kami tapos nung palabas na kami nag senyas yung isang nag iinterview dun sa dalawang matangkad and narinig ko na for final inrerview sila.

I live in a South American country. I'm a preschool teacher, I had two jobs, and I suffered from burnout. I had to quit my job because otherwise I would die working.(I was in bed for 7 months, exhausted; now I'm much better)


Because of this, my financial situation has plummeted. And now the psychologists I can see are from a platform here that offers social services. The consultation fees are low. But the quality of the professionals is terrible.

I had been in therapy for over 12 years before this. And I stayed with each psychologist for about two or three years.

This year alone, I'm seeing my fourth psychologist. It's incredibly draining. I've seen problems. The first one lacked experience; the second one felt like I was a burden to her (I was in the worst stage of burnout). Now, the third one opposes everything I say. She said an abusive ex had contacted me after 10 years. And she said he could have changed after 10 years; she didn't even want to know about the abusive situations he subjected me to. Now, in the last few weeks‚ÄîI wear a mask and continue to protect myself from COVID (I follow American scientists on Twitter, scientific studies, there's an online group here in my country that also cares about COVID; I see myself as a COVID activist)‚Äîand in the penultimate session, I mentioned how I felt pressured by a friend who made me have afternoon coffee in a poorly ventilated place in her house. My psychologist said I'm overprotective, that life is uncertain, so I shouldn't worry too much about COVID. Hearing this from her was like her saying, ""Have sex without a condom,"" ""Drive without a seatbelt,"" since life is full of uncertainties. Her words made me so upset that I couldn't sleep that night.

Yes, I sent her an email explaining why I was worried about COVID (the text was three pages long).

I attached a list of eight items, including American scientists I followed, scientific studies, etc.

Even so, in the last session, she tried to downplay her remarks.

Please give me some optimistic phrases to see if I can improve, because this history of bad psychologists has made me feel bad. And now having to change psychologists again leaves me feeling quite lost.

I love handmade crafts, art, and vintage shopping, and I have a sunny personality. Lorenzo has a big Luigi-style moustache and makes the best pizza I know! He's a bit reserved but always cracks the perfect joke at the right moment.

We'd love to meet new people and make friends, whether for coffee, exploring the city, vintage hunts, museum trips, or casual 
hangouts.

1mz0ky3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Agreeable-Macaron166/comments/1mz0ky3/lesson_learnednever_compromise_on_your_sleep/,Lesson learned-Never compromise on your sleep.,"For a long time, I used to wake up irritated and sometimes sweating in the middle of the night. I thought it was normal, summer heat, long workdays, too much stress. It impacted my focus a lot. It was when my cousin came over from the US who told me that he could not sleep well. It was not the usual jet lag as it did not even improve after weeks. He said the bed felt uneven and my old mattress had lost shape, which is why we were not getting proper support. Next thing I know, he ordered me a mattress as a gift. It was the sleep company Smart Luxe mattress.

I thought he was just showing off. But two weeks later, I started waking up feeling rested, not dragging through the morning. My focus at work improved, my mood was better and I didn‚Äôt feel sweaty at night. I then googled about the **orthopedic mattress** and read about their **smartgrid technology** which keeps airflow going, so it does not overheat. Unlike my old memory foam mattress that had sagged and lost shape years ago, this one distributes weight evenly, keeps pressure points minimal, and has helped me get relief from all the soreness.

Looking back, I never connected half of my irritability and poor productivity to my old mattress. I always blamed stress or coffee. Now, I get why people say not to compromise on sleep. Feels like my body finally got the memo about what real rest should feel like. So please do not ever compromise on sleep quality because it affects your overall well-being.",1,1756053828.0,u_Agreeable-Macaron166,0,1.0,False
1mz0kdz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz0kdz,I made holes in my Kalita Wave 185 Tsubame,"I bought a Kalita Wave 185 Tsubame sometime last year, and in order to increase the flow rate and prevent stalling such that it matches the glass version (which I had been using previously), I used a centre punch to increase the size of the holes (final picture). This had the effect of shaping the holes into a funnel shape which helped break the surface tension (if you see the glass version, the holes are slightly curved into such a shape), as well as widening the holes by about 1-2mm.

I found that it would still stall occasionally.

Then I figured something out: the Tsubame occasionally forms a seal around the cup, which creates pressure as the cup fills, occasionally preventing the last few mm of coffee from draining. I finally took the plunge and bought a hole punch (pictured) and punched a few holes round the side, and can report that this has solved the stalling problem completely! It also subjectively seems to improve the flow rate even further still.

Also I can brew with hotter water as the contact time between the water and the coffee has been reduced.

I did notice that the regular Stainless Steel Wave 185 does seem to have a hole drilled for this purpose. The glass version sits on a plastic stand with plenty of airflow around it.

I know that it‚Äôs an expensive thing to be making holes in.

My coffee now tastes better than ever.

I‚Äôm on break from my first term in school and it kinda whipped my butt physically and energetically. I‚Äôm a full time student and was working three days a week for 6 hours each, closing Friday and opening Saturdays. Got to experience taxation and blood deficiency wind first hand. Not fun. But I have since learned a lot and made some adjustments I want to share to inspire others. Some of my symptoms were the eye floaters and twitching around my body and heavy arms upon waking, pale to clear urine and loose stools. Seems my kidney yang was weak too. 
To remedy my situation I adjusted my schedule to all closing shifts to give me time to eat and practice some qigong before work.  Big breakfasts! Wild rice eggs and some meat. More beef in my diet too. And one cup of coffee with added protein powder and beet powder. And I realized the sweating from work was depleting my electrolytes. And an electrolyte imbalance can lead to weakness and twitching and clear urine too.  So I did some research on a supplement that wasn‚Äôt loaded with sugar and I found one that has a long list of the various minerals including copper (which is necessary for blood production). I had also been experiencing dream disturbed sleep so I started taking magnesium glycinate and  L-theanine before bed for a more restful sleep. I‚Äôm not all the way there yet but I‚Äôm feeling so much better my tongue looks healthier now too. Hope this is helpful. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è ",5,1756053747.0,ChineseMedicine,3,1.0,False

Every time we interact in person, the energy feels amazing ‚Äî she smiles, shares personal things, jokes, we hug, laugh, and seems genuinely happy to see me. Friends/colleagues who have been with me also noticed the good vibe.

Over the past months I‚Äôve also given her small thoughtful gifts (notes, little things tied to our conversations), and she‚Äôs always responded warmly in person. She‚Äôs said multiple times she‚Äôd like to see me outside of Starbucks ‚Äî go for a beer, spend a day together, or recently go to a big public event she herself said wanted to go.

Here‚Äôs where it gets confusing:
	‚Ä¢	She told me she‚Äôd check her agenda and let me know.
	‚Ä¢	I messaged her midweek, she replied the next morning, and I answered again suggesting we pick a day. Since then‚Ä¶ silence.
	‚Ä¢	Meanwhile, I‚Äôve seen her at work looking fine, and she‚Äôs active on Spotify. So she‚Äôs clearly alive and functioning, just not replying to me.

I understand she works very hard, has tiring shifts, and might not always be in a good headspace. But the mismatch between her words (‚ÄúI want to spend time with you‚Äù) and her actions (not following through, not replying) leaves me feeling stuck. It almost feels like we‚Äôre in a ‚ÄúCoffee place bubble‚Äù where things are great there, but nothing moves beyond it.

I don‚Äôt want to chase or pressure her. At the same time, I do care about her more than I expected, and I value honesty. If she doesn‚Äôt want to meet outside, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî but I‚Äôd rather she say it than just go quiet.

My question: Given the age gap and situation, should I keep being consistent (showing up once or twice a week at the coffee place where she works, being warm and positive), or should I step back and wait for her to take initiative? And if she stays silent, is it fair at some point to gently ask for clarity?",2,1756053723.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I'm looking for some advice from the community on a potential grinder upgrade path and wanted to get your thoughts.

**My Current Setup:**

* **Filter Grinder:** Timemore Sculptor 064s
* **Espresso Grinder:** Lagom Mini (48mm conical)

I know, it's a bit of a weird matchup having the 64mm flat for filter and the smaller conical for espresso, but it's the setup I've landed on for now and I'm enjoying it. The 064s has been a fantastic filter grinder for my daily V60s and occasional brews on other drippers.

**The Upgrade Dilemma:**

The inevitable upgrade bug has bitten me, and I've been seriously considering saving up for a **Timemore Sculptor 078**.

My proposed plan would be:

1. Buy the **Sculptor 078** to become my dedicated, end-game filter coffee grinder.
2. Move the **Sculptor 064s** to be my dedicated espresso grinder.
3. Shelf the Lagom Mini.

My main question is for those who have experience with both grinders, or have made a similar jump from a high-quality 64mm flat burr to a 78mm one:

**For filter coffee ONLY, is the upgrade from the 064s to the 078 a significant, night-and-day difference that justifies the cost?**

I'm trying to figure out if this is a case of chasing the last 5% of performance for a huge price jump, or if the larger burr set on the 078 genuinely unlocks a new level of clarity, flavor separation, and complexity in the cup.

	‚Ä¢	Sep 8‚Äì9 ‚Üí Flores (1 night)
	‚Ä¢	Sep 9‚Äì14 ‚Üí Lomba da Maia, S√£o Miguel

	‚Ä¢	Day 4 (Central east): Lagoa do Fogo, Caldeira Velha, Salto do Cabrito, Gorreana/Porto Formoso tea.
	‚Ä¢	Day 5 (West): Sete Cidades (Boca do Inferno, Vista do Rei), Ferraria hot spring (low tide), Mosteiros sunset.
	‚Ä¢	Day 6 (SE hike): Salto do Prego + Praia do Fogo (warm-water beach).
	‚Ä¢	Day 7 (Ponta Delgada indoors): Gruta do Carv√£o lava tube, pineapple greenhouses.
	‚Ä¢	Day 8‚Äì9 (Flores): Po√ßo da Ribeira do Ferreiro/Alagoinha, Rocha dos Bord√µes, Po√ßo do Bacalhau, Faj√£ Grande sunset.
	‚Ä¢	Day 10 (North coast): Praia dos Moinhos, Miradouro do Cintr√£o.
	‚Ä¢	Day 11 (Whales + islet): Whale/dolphin tour, Vila Franca do Campo islet (if open).

	2.	Any days that look too heavy on driving?
	3.	Is Pico da Vara worth it for a first-timer (permit trail)?
	4.	Is Vila Franca islet open for swimming in Sep 2025, or only boat-around?
	5.	Any food recs in Nordeste or Lomba da Maia?
6. Any other places I must cover and see?

1mz0hcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1mz0hcm/should_you_buy_the_best_coffee_machine_lavazza/,Should You Buy the Best Coffee Machine Lavazza Classy Plus,"The Lavazza Classy Plus might just be the coffee machine that brings barista-quality drinks directly to your kitchen. My mornings have always been incomplete without a solid cup of coffee, and I decided to test this coffee brewer after hearing it could handle everything from espressos to milky lattes. As someone who spends way too much time breaking down features of every appliance I come across, this machine wasn't going to escape my critical eye (or taste buds). Here's how it measured up in daily use.  

**Design and Practicality**  
Right off the bat, the sleek and compact design of the Classy Plus makes it ideal for small kitchen spaces. Measuring 7.87 x 18.9 x 13.78 inches and weighing just under 10 pounds, it fits neatly on most countertops. The elegant black finish is understated yet classy (pun totally intended). The attention to detail in its ergonomics is apparent, from the adjustable drip tray that accommodates various cup sizes to the intuitive button layout on the top. I particularly appreciated that it didn‚Äôt dominate my limited counter space. For those tight on kitchen real estate, this machine plays nice.

**Brewing Variety and Options**  
I wasn't here for just a boring old cup of coffee, and thankfully, this model didn‚Äôt disappoint. Capable of brewing everything from espresso and lungo to an 8 oz regular coffee, it even ventures into more luxurious territory with cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos. The built-in milk vessel and frother are a game-changer if you're a fan of silky foam on your drinks. I found myself enjoying a perfectly frothed cappuccino one morning and a creamy latte the next. The preset options make drink prep practically foolproof, though you can adjust some settings for a more personalized experience.

[See Lavazza Classy Plus deals on Amazon now.](https://sohdu.com/p/b08j8j3s4y/)

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
As someone who values efficiency, I loved how quickly this coffee maker heated up and brewed a cup. If you're rushing out the door in the morning, that speed is a lifesaver. Each drink comes out consistent in quality thanks to precise capsule technology. Speaking of capsules, this machine works with Lavazza Blue and Expert Capsules, ensuring you have a diverse selection of flavors and intensities. It might irk some coffee purists tied to their grind-and-brew rituals, but for capsule enthusiasts, it‚Äôs heaven-sent. The flavor depth surprised me‚Äîfor a single-serve system, the espressos were flavorful and carried an impressive crema.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and modern design that fits easily on compact counters  
- Ability to prepare a variety of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes  
- Built-in milk frother for creamy, caf√©-style drinks  
- Lavazza capsule compatibility for diverse flavor options  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The reliance on Lavazza-specific capsules limits options for those who prefer more versatility in coffee brand choices  
- Cleaning the built-in milk frother can be a bit tedious compared to simpler systems  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing the Classy Plus to other popular single-serve machines like Nespresso models, the difference becomes clearer. Nespresso machines might edge out the Lavazza in terms of capsule variety (thanks to third-party options). However, the Lavazza Classy Plus wins hands-down for milk-based beverages with its built-in frother delivering excellent results. Keurig machines, on the other hand, offer greater ground coffee options but fall short in creating frothy or industry-level barista drinks. Each brand caters to a slightly different crowd, but if you're a cappuccino or latte fanatic, the Classy Plus simply takes the crown.  

**Price Performance**  
While this isn‚Äôt the cheapest single-serve machine around, the value lies in what it offers. The combination of brewing versatility and a built-in frother ensures a near caf√©-quality experience at home. Skipping trips to the coffee shop justifies the price in a matter of weeks for regular drinkers. As someone who‚Äôs spent way too much money at trendy caf√©s in the past, having this machine has definitely improved my financial decisions (well, at least in one area).

But now, as an adult, my POTS symptoms are so severe that even with exercising and a good diet and lots of water and mindful activity, I still can't do many things without nearly passing out. My blood pressure sits at a low rate all the time too. I can't hardly shower, get up out of bed, walk places, and even drink coffee too fast, or take a hot bath, without needing to do something so I don't pass out/getting extremely lightheaded. And sometimes it just comes in like a wave, like when I have a standing job. I don't get it. Also I notice I hold my breath for a long time accidentally, like somehow forgetting to breathe. Then I catch it and have to take a few deep breaths. It feels so weird.

2. I have these and wonder if there's a correlation, and if others have them? 
I have PTSD, ADHD, hEDS, ASD, POTS, Minor Depression, and Anxiety. I recently learned that hEDS and POTS are connected, and was wondering if others have more knowledge of any overlaps, specifically with symptoms, so I know what to look for. If anyone has helpful tips on mitigating detriments of these conditions, I also welcome those.

3. I recently moved to Florida, for some totally not thought out reason, as I almost die frequently. This is worded partially as a joke, as I do just sit down to stop the process, usually. I have to be extra careful about everything now. Does anyone live somewhere warm/humid/hot that has any tips or advice? I don't have blood pooling. And I keep ice cold water in a reusable water bottle at all times, and sit in public when I feel myself getting close to passing out. Sometimes narrating helps too, but I only do that privately, and only if super severe symptoms. I also carry an umbrella sometimes and use it to block the sun, which has saved me multiple times now. 

4. The way fashion has changed to these fabrics is also difficult. The heat retention in some of these fabrics truly makes the difference on whether or not I can take a 3 block walk without needing to sit down or not. I have one outfit in ""athletic"" type moisture wicking fabric and it helps significantly. If I wear a dress that's close to my skin, or even the sleeves are too long, it can make me need to sit down frequently to avoid passing out. Does anyone have any advice? It's awful.

Also I recently entered homelessness in Florida, and got placed into an apartment, but have had terrible luck getting a job. Despite having my BS in Accounting and experience. This isn't a question, but I'm adding it for context.

Thank you all for your help and any input you can provide!! 
Hope you all have a lovely Sunday üå∏‚òÄÔ∏èüíï",7,1756053555.0,POTS,1,1.0,False

1mz0b1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/1mz0b1g/humor_when_fiber_line_broke_and_isp_support_gave/,HUMOR - When fiber line broke and ISP support gave me the evil eye..,"So anyways this happened about over a week ago; so fresh enough that i gotta share before it all gets blurry \*(I'm still getting calls from the ISP about wtf happened last week). I'll break it down into bullet point sequence so its easier to follow and keep track. Happy reading..



\-- Thursday about BEFORE 2pm; fibre line breaks. ONT is blinking RED; means there's a problem with the fibre line. Get the WhatsApp from ISP asking if there's a problem with the line and if i'd like to setup a tech to come. Dont hold my breath because system says next possible availability is Monday. Dangit; whole weekend without the 'net. Kids are gonna miss their weekend Roblox/Minecraft with friends. Better get used to the satellite TV channels, kids. I'm thinking it's the rain causing the fibre to break \*(but rain didnt start until almost 3pm. Maybe i got my timing wrong. Anyhoo; might be just like what happened back in Jan, Feb AND March. Yeah; ONCE per MONTH for 3 months start of 2025).



\-- Friday morning about 11am; ISP tech calls; says they're in the neigbourhood. You home and can we drop by? I'm like SURE! You're welcome! I'll layout the water bottles for ya'll \*(sorry no coffee). Long story short; it's the most irritating of problems. It seems at a outdoor box down the street from my house; some installer was messing around and unplugged me. Rain coming and rush job yada yada yada. Fastest fix in my record; just plug me back in. ISP Guys back in my house spending 5 mins confirming the fibre's plugs all good and in correct ports with their tester(s) and system. I'm like thanks ya'll; saved my weekend. here's some ice cold water for the effort. \*(So i didnt get my timing wrong; the line broke/disconnected BEFORE it rained).

  
\-- SAME FRIDAY; 3pm. 4hrs later. There's no connection. ONT's blinking GREEN; the kind of error that says you've got a connection; but you're not getting in. Unfortunately; i'm leaving the house for the school run to pickup the kids. Dont come back till afer dinner; which is 8pm. Spend the next hour troubleshooting to confirm (Bill's paid on time; account is NOT BARRED; ONT's working fine; router setting's unchanged and login ID's correct. BUT ONT isnt getting a line after about half dozen reboot and plug/unplugs). So forced to disconnect the fibre cable to create a ""breaK""in the connection and try and whatsapp ISP tech support. Next available tech isnt until Monday. I am SOL. Movie night; Had to teach my kids how to channel surf. \*\*(Teach. My. Kids. Channel Surfing. These monkeys can surf Google TV/Youtube like a seasoned pro; but i had to teach them how to channel surf satellite TV?! Facepalm moment )

  
\-- Saturday 10am.. Phone rings and Hallelujah; another tech's in the neighbourhood. Can he drop by? Like a drop of rain in a desert , he's welcome! ISP Techie drops by; i give him the short story about what happened on Thurs and Friday. Looks at the ONT and says yup; that's not right. Unplugs the Fibres and test's them; yeah getting a connection no problem. Asks me if i ever rebooted the ONT. I says ""I got 2 kids and its friday night after school. Ya think i havent tried that with kids nagging?! At least a half dozen times i tried"". ISP Tech Get's on the phone calling someone up the chain to confirm the account and line is working \*(they say yeah it is) and is then rebooting the ONT. Caller says no issue on their part; and suddenly the ONT is SOLID GREEN after a reboot. Tech gives me the evil eye.

""I know that Evil Eye look! i tell you man; i had 2 sons complaining last night. I used to work in Enterprise support with 400+ computers and servers. Ya think i wouldnt do a simple reboot at home BEFORE i call ya'll? I spent 1 hour troubleshooting and rebooting everything myself before i filed a ticket!!""

ISP tech accepts explanation and thinks its one of those where the ONT fears him more than it fears my wife & kids.. So anyways he says he wont close it for a few more hours and if i dont call him he'll close the ticket end of day. I say great. 

  
\-- Line works all the way until ... Monday evening. ONT is blinking RED. Again.

\-- Tuesday ISP morning tech comes over; same problem as last Thurs. Some idiot unplugged me again. This time tech makes adjustment to the street box and logs the issue with HQ about which contractor is screwing with the street box ...



So anyways; hope ya'll have a great read.   
  
PS -- As a special bonus; there's picture of the DLINK ONT our ISP is using. You'll find it ironic the name the ISP is using. But i do like the fact that DLINK is now able to sell Router's with ONT built-in. Maybe it'll trickle down to prosumer/consumer whereby everyone will be able to buy a replacement All-In-One ONT-Router. \*(Previously our ISP hardware setup was a 2 unit combo Huawei ONT + Dlink Router. We can always replace the router with whatever brand that supported our country. Now it seems the ISP is streamlining abit by merging the ONT + router into 1 unit. I had to setup the ONT as bridge modem so i can still use my own router+mesh).  


PSS -- ISP customer service bugging me about how's their quality and all that shit and why so many call outs over the weekend. If this was corporate SLA; they would be hearing from my accountant boss ...

I chose a BYO Iced coffee because now we can select how many pumps of whatever it is you want, and tbh I wasn't really sure what I wanted so I just did that. ANYWAY.. when I walked on, I saw a 16oz cold cup sitting on the ledge and it looked completely white. I first thought maybe thats someone's Iced Chai. But nope, it had my name on it. As I inspected the sticker I saw that the recipe didn't instruct to add any Coffee. Had a conversation with the person working and she said ""yeah you know I thought that was weird but I didn't want to assume so I just did what it said."" She remade it for me, and I called the contact center to have them look into it. Contact Center said it was interesting and they would look into it. 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Day or two later, I'm at work and order another BYO Coffee.. happens again!

And okay, I'm sure most of you are thinking ""well anyone with a brain would just add the coffee first. ""  Yeah. Sure, some. But I do know people do in fact order flavored milks at Starbucks so you could also assume that someone could order it without coffee intentionally, but either way it should say - Iced Coffee to 9oz- or whatever.

She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Every time I opened up, she'd say: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would‚Ä¶ and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to a party  so I said I‚Äôd go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside‚Ä¶ her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn‚Äôt even check on me. Just said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should ‚Äújust be friends.‚Äù But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled‚Ä¶ then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday  I didn‚Äôt go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

I went to see her photos and she looks super different, my cousin said she looks less depressed.

TL;DR: Dated a girl who constantly gave mixed signals  canceling plans, blocking me, guilt-tripping me, playing jealousy games, and keeping me at arm‚Äôs length while demanding closeness. Every time I opened up, she‚Äôd disappear or flip the script. Even after breaking up, she kept pulling me back with ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù texts while I later found her on dating apps.

Testing different portable espresso machines as part of my daily grind always gets interesting, and the OutIn OTEM-01 Nano Portable Espresso Machine certainly caught my eye. Its compact dimensions‚Äî9.84"" x 7.09"" x 3.54""‚Äîmake it small enough to slip comfortably into a backpack or even a large purse. At only 1.47 pounds, carrying it around while hiking or traveling doesn‚Äôt feel like a burden. I appreciate the metallic exterior finish; it not only looks modern but feels sturdy when handling it. It feels well-crafted, with the food-grade stainless steel components adding to its overall durability. Traveling with a coffee maker capable of this kind of aesthetic appeal was something my coworkers immediately envied.

**Ease of Use and Smart Features**  
What really stood out to me is just how intuitive it is to use. The one-button operation system ensures even a caffeine-deprived zombie in the morning like me can manage to brew a shot of espresso. With its automatic operation mode, there‚Äôs no fussing with complicated settings. Plus, the 2-in-1 brewing setup allows switching between ground coffee and NS capsules seamlessly. During my test, I alternated between using capsules at work and freshly ground coffee during outdoor trips. The versatility is phenomenal.

**Heating Performance & Crema Quality**  
The heating mechanism performs efficiently. It managed to heat 1.7 ounces of water (at room temperature) to 198¬∞F in just around 200 seconds during my experiment, which is quite impressive! The 20-bar pressure system ensures dense, rich crema on top of every espresso shot I brewed. During a recent camping trip, my friends couldn‚Äôt stop raving about how the coffee tasted as good as something you‚Äôd get in a caf√©. Though the waiting time might not be instantaneous, the results more than make up for it.

**Battery Life and Portability**  
As someone constantly on the move, I put its 7500mAh battery to the test. It lasted for several brewing cycles‚Äîup to five hot shots on room-temperature water‚Äîwithout needing a recharge, which feels sufficient for short trips. While charging, having the USB-C compatibility made it easy to plug into my car's port or portable power bank. That said, on longer trips, keeping a backup power source handy is wise if you‚Äôre going to indulge in several espresso shots per day.

**Advantages**  
- Lightweight and travel-friendly design.  
- Solid build quality with food-grade materials.  
- High pressure (20 bar) delivers caf√©-quality results.  

**Negatives**  
- Battery capacity may not suffice for extended travel without recharging.  
- Slightly slower heating time compared to desktop machines.  

**Rival Brands**  
Having previously used portable espresso makers like the Wacaco Nanopresso and Staresso D16, I can attest that this product outperforms in design simplicity and ease of portability. While the Wacaco requires manual pumping to build pressure, this one‚Äôs fully automatic, saving both effort and time. However, its battery-powered functionality doesn‚Äôt match the non-reliant energy of competitors like the Aeropress Go, which is purely manual but lacks true espresso quality.

**Affordable Quality**  
For a portable espresso machine packed with these features, I‚Äôd say it provides a solid quality-to-price ratio. The ability to brew caf√©-grade coffee while camping or traveling elevates it from just being ""nice to have"" to almost essential. Pricewise, it stands as a worthwhile investment for anyone valuing performance matching convenience.

Husband and I (50s) are headed to Spain (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid) from San Diego, CA in September and have started piecing together our first-time itinerary. 

I've purchased tickets for the Picasso Museum and the Gaudi tour and made flight/hotel reservations but that's about it so far. Days can be moved around.

I don't plan on making food reservations ahead of time unless I stumble on a must do that I need to reserve.

I feel like most of the big rocks are set - looking for suggestions and recommendations, food, neighborhoods to explore, resources, tours.

* Primarily interested in art - museums, public art (murals, sculpture), arts communities - and culture.  Our spanish is poor, so theater is probably out.

* We like walking tours, hosted tours, audio tours. Architecture and art focused mostly, history.  A food tour if it's notable.

* We like casual food, coffee shops, and cafes. Outdoors, hiking. Churches, cultural sites. Love a park.  Less interested in fine dining, bars, nightlife, instagram experiences. 

* Neutral about huge palaces - looking at furniture and plates. We had a great time in London for a week + last year without visiting a single palace and I wasn't mad about it. We don't mind missing out on top tourist sites if they aren't our thing. 

* We'll be using public transportation.

* We like to be busy but don't necessarily love to schedule every minute. I don‚Äôt want to stay in more than 3 hotels for a 2 week trip, which is why I chose these three cities.

1mz01nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1mz01nh/breakfast_home_fries_edition/,Breakfast - Home Fries Edition,"I‚Äôve been on a little mission lately: finding a breakfast spot with genuinely good home fries. Big thanks to everyone who gave me suggestions‚ÄîI‚Äôve been working my way through them. These are, of course, just my personal takes, so I encourage you to try them yourself. Here‚Äôs what I found (in no particular order):

Angie‚Äôs (Garner)
A dependable breakfast spot with consistently solid food. I‚Äôm not wild about their home fries, but the hash browns‚Äîwhen ordered extra crispy‚Äîare excellent. The biggest drawback? They‚Äôre closed on Sundays, which is when I usually go out for breakfast. Service is always great. Bonus points: flavored coffee creamer!

Eggs Up Grill (Garner)
Good breakfast overall, with decent but unremarkable home fries. My only recurring issue is with the meat‚Äîit‚Äôs often served cold, which can be disappointing. Still, service is friendly and attentive. Bonus points: flavored coffee creamer!

The Shiny Diner (Raleigh)
A fun 50‚Äôs-style diner with lots of character. Unfortunately, the food doesn‚Äôt quite match the theme‚Äîhome fries were bland and the breakfast overall just ‚Äúokay.‚Äù

NY Diner (Knightdale)
A standout for both food and service. The home fries here are seasoned well and very tasty. The atmosphere has a welcoming, family-style vibe, and the staff are consistently excellent. The food across the board is solid, and the service is some of the best I‚Äôve had. The interior has a warm, adobe feel. Highly recommend.

A Place at the Table (Raleigh)
This place deserves credit for its mission: a pay-what-you-can model that ensures everyone can eat. On my visit, they were out of both coffee and home fries, so I settled for eggs and sausage. Honestly, the meal wasn‚Äôt great, but the concept and friendliness of the staff make this spot worth supporting.

First and Last (Raleigh)
A strong menu with healthy options and a good overall breakfast. Unfortunately, the potatoes are consistently over-seasoned‚Äîsalty every single time, across multiple visits. If they toned down the seasoning, this would easily rank higher.

Big Ed‚Äôs (Garner)
Breakfast was okay, but their cubed, deep-fried style of home fries isn‚Äôt my preference. Pancakes were slightly burnt on my visit, but service was excellent and the rest of the food was fine.

Biscuitville (Clayton)
I didn‚Äôt realize this leaned more toward fast-food breakfast (similar to McDonald‚Äôs). The food was fine, but not memorable. If I were choosing fast-food breakfast, I‚Äôd probably stick with McDonald‚Äôs.

Brigs (Raleigh)
My current favorite. The home fries are well-seasoned and delicious, and the breakfast overall is consistently excellent. Service is top-notch, and it‚Äôs conveniently located next to Trader Joe‚Äôs for a post-breakfast run. Bonus points: flavored coffee creamer!

Still on my list: State Farmers Market and Pam‚Äôs Farmhouse (though Pam‚Äôs is closed Sundays). If you‚Äôve got more recommendations for great home fries (not the cubed deep-fried kind), I‚Äôd love to hear them!",2,1756052617.0,raleigh,1,0.75,False

Buzzing filled my ears as a strange flavor filled my mouth. I swallowed again and again, taking as much as I could. Then the buzzing increased.

‚ÄúWake, Alex‚Ä¶.‚Äù Noseens voice sounded far away. ‚ÄúPlease wake, squishy one‚Ä¶‚Äù

I tried to speak, but it didn‚Äôt work. Instead, I drifted back into darkness and pain. So much pain. Everything inside me wanted to lash out, but I resisted.¬†

Control.

I was in control.

The next time I became aware, a steady beat filled my ears. Then it went away. More flavor entered my mouth. Need filled me, a powerful need to eat.

‚ÄúSquishy one, wake!‚Äù

This time the command rolled inside my mind, strong enough to clear away the fog. The pain was gone, but the hunger remained.

My eyes snapped open and I jerked back, growling. I scrambled until I hit a hard surface, blinking in the darkness. Something towered over me, but I stared at the person with the cup.

The same smell as that flavor came from the cup.

‚ÄúAlex, you must eat.‚Äù The spoken words made me freeze as I stared beyond the cup.

Lenna knelt in leaves, holding a strange cup toward me. She motioned to her mouth. ‚ÄúEat. You need food.‚Äù

I needed meat. A piece of meat appeared inside my mouth, tasting strongly of corn. Notifications waited for me, poking at the edges of my mind as I ate and I ate. The food in my stomach grounded me as I tried to put the pieces together.

Lenna set the cup down and waited.

Beyond her, I spotted two large shadows.

\[Kabi-Bound, Swordwarrior, Azurafolk - Forest-dweller, Level 91.\]

\[Cekta-Bound, Rune Apprentice, Azurafolk - Forest-dweller, Level 87.\]

The crystals around their necks buzzed angrily in my head. Then Lenna‚Äôs information popped up, pushing all my concern for myself away.

\[Lenna De La Dengu, Pathfinder, Starfire Arrow, Level 52, Friend.\]

I tried to speak, but my throat wouldn‚Äôt work. Eventually, the words came out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Lenna.‚Äù I knew how important ranking up was to her people, and she couldn‚Äôt even be with her family during it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. We both survived, and we will thrive through these challenges. That is more than I could have asked for without you coming after me,‚Äù she said with a sad smile. ‚ÄúDengu still lives, the bond is there. They need your help.‚Äù

She motioned to the two figures still in the shadows.

Too many questions raced through my mind, but I pushed them aside and went with both the most important, and the easiest.

‚ÄúAre we safe?‚Äù

Kabi answered, ‚ÄúOnly for a limited time. We need to reach a burrow before dawn.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow far?‚Äù

He stared at the other blue guy, who held up a couple of fingers.

‚ÄúToo far, we must move.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long was I out?‚Äù I asked Lenna.

‚ÄúThree days.‚Äù¬†

Holy fuck, three whole days.

‚ÄúYou were suffering from Growth Shock and injuries from the explosion.‚Äù She crept closer, still holding the cup out. ‚ÄúThis is medicine to help babies gain weight. You need to drink it to help recover.‚Äù

I took the cup carefully from her hands as she nodded at me encouragingly.

\[Mushroom Milk, Energy rich food.\]

I downed it, even though I felt full from the meat. Energy rushed through my limbs like I‚Äôd just downed a pot of coffee. She took the cup from me and handed it back to Kabi, who stepped closer.

The guy had dark blue skin and multiple arms. Pitch-black hair was pulled back into braids going down his back. His chest was bare, with dark runes tattooed onto his skin. At least he wore pants with leather boots. It was something semi-normal.

‚ÄúWe need to leave,‚Äù he said with a grimace. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been carrying you. It might be best to continue.‚Äù

One of his hands appeared different from the others, missing fingers, though it wasn‚Äôt wrapped like an injury.¬†

‚ÄúI can barely keep up,‚Äù whispered Lenna. ‚ÄúCekta‚Äôs been carrying me when I need to rest to keep making progress.‚Äù

The other guy blushed, and I noticed he didn‚Äôt have any runes on his body, though he was dressed the same as Kabi. The crystal in the solid ring around his neck drew my attention.

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I asked.

Anger crossed his face, almost making me flinch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm collared, a slave to those Forgers.‚Äù

Lenna‚Äôs words made more sense now. Her insistence that I needed to help them.

I nodded at Kabi, who had approached.

He approached to pick me up, but it brought me closer to the necklace, which I couldn‚Äôt help but touch.

He froze.

The presence inside screamed at my touch, begging for release. Darkness wove through this structure, though the entire thing wasn‚Äôt crystal. Only a small part of the ring was crystal, the size of my palm, maybe the thickness of a pencil.

I hummed, and it flared to life. Before anyone spoke, I yanked on it with my ability to make crystal malleable.

It burned.

Oh fuck, it burned.

The skin on my palm sizzled, but then the sliver came free. The healing crystal on my necklace rushed to fix my hand as the edges of my vision went black.

I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.

Energy rushed around Kabi making the runes flare a dark purple color. He shook for a moment, but reached out as I fell backward, unable to stay upright anymore.

The presence of the firestone thanked me as my vision went dark. Whispers came from the stones on my necklace as more cooling energy rushed through my body.

\#

The next time I came to, I lay next to a small fire in some sort of cavern. My fingers itched and clenching my hand felt strange. A little tight.

It still was only the four of us as my senses stretched outward. I frantically stuffed my stomach full of meat, though it didn‚Äôt seem as satisfying as before.

Kabi watched me from across the fire, a confused look on his face. ‚ÄúYou freed me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I whispered as I carefully sat up.¬†

‚ÄúCan you free others?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúProbably, but I need to figure out a way to not hurt myself first.‚Äù I flexed my hand, the stiffness thankfully gone.

‚ÄúThe same thing happens when we try to harm the rings. They burn us until we comply or lose our heads.‚Äù A bit of a darkened line lay across his thick neck. ‚ÄúThe pain was worth it to be free.‚Äù

He bowed his head to me.

‚ÄúI owe you my life.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt makes us even. You saved Lenna and I.‚Äù¬†

Lenna slept next to me while Cekta rested near Kabi. Something was different about her. She felt special to my senses, but I hoped it only had something to do with her Rank up. Notifications pinged at my mind even more than before, but I wanted to know the situation here before I got distracted.

‚ÄúAre we safe here?‚Äù The cavern stretched overhead, and the area felt stuffy. Water trickled down one wall, and more of the massive mushrooms filled the areas near each of the walls.

‚ÄúAs much as we can be.‚Äù He let out a sigh. ‚ÄúWe are in the middle reaches of the forest, and this is a safe burrow. Though, the ring on my brother‚Äôs neck means if one of the demons is close enough they can sense him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce I check my notifications, I can take a look, and try a few things.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is important to my people, more important than me.‚Äù His golden blue eyes stared at me. ‚ÄúHe must be freed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will do my best.‚Äù

That seemed to satisfy the guy, and I opened my notifications to see what the heck had happened.

The stats gained for my profession were so low that the five levels didn‚Äôt trigger anything, except the act itself of freeing the crystal had taken too much of my energy.

‚ÄúHow long was I out this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is still the same night cycle,‚Äù he said.

Still, I had to wonder, what was a binding crystal?

I (30F) didn‚Äôt attend my brother‚Äôs engagement, and now my family is upset with me.

For context: I grew up in a dysfunctional home. My dad was physically abusive, and my mum was emotionally absent ‚Äî she only ever cared about her ‚Äúsons.‚Äù I‚Äôm the youngest, and while all my siblings have moved on with their lives, I feel stuck. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years trying to work through the neglect, grief, abuse and trauma.

When I finally found someone I wanted to consider for marriage, my brother refused to chaperone a simple coffee meeting. Relatives then made awful, awkward comments to the guy‚Äôs family, which ruined things. These comments from my family cut really deep, and I spend therapy sessions unpicking them.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt want to pretend we‚Äôre a functional family to impress my new sister-in-law‚Äôs family. We are very dysfunctional, with years of abuse. Smiling through it would have been a lie, and I couldn‚Äôt do it.

Our family is dysfunctional in the sense that no one actually speaks to each other. We don‚Äôt eat together, we don‚Äôt spend time together ‚Äî we only pass each other in the house by accident. There‚Äôs no real parental bond, no sibling relationship, nothing.

Moving out isn‚Äôt a real option either ‚Äî in my culture, it‚Äôs seen as insensitive/taboo for an unmarried daughter to leave home, even though I‚Äôm financially independent with a great job. What I want is simple: to marry and have happiness. But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not even worthy of it.

Every time we hang out  whether it‚Äôs grabbing coffee, going for a walk, or even just sitting at my place  they immediately set up their phone and start streaming.

I didn‚Äôt say anything at first because I figured it was just a phase, but now it‚Äôs constant. I don‚Äôt want to be on camera all the time, especially when I‚Äôm venting about work or just trying to relax. Yesterday, I finally told them,  I don‚Äôt want to be live every time we hang out. Can you chill with the streaming when we‚Äôre together?

They got defensive and said I‚Äôm not being supportive of their career and that I‚Äôm overreacting because everyone‚Äôs online these days.

Now they‚Äôre giving me short replies and acting distant. AITAH for asking for privacy during our hangouts?",3,1756052302.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Hey üëã

I‚Äôm new to NYC and looking for an accountability buddy! I‚Äôve had one before and it honestly worked wonders ‚Äî at work I‚Äôm always the organized one who‚Äôs ten steps ahead, but when it comes to my own life I tend to lose track. Having someone to check in with made such a big difference, and I‚Äôd love to build that again here.

Some of the things I‚Äôd like accountability for:

Sticking to social plans (I try my best but often cancel last minute). I‚Äôd be happy if you joined too ‚Äî I‚Äôm into language exchanges, exploring coffee shops, museums, going for walks, and just discovering what NYC has to offer.

Keeping up with everyday stuff like paying bills, cleaning, eating clean, apartment hunting, etc.

Maybe even trying a gym class or sports together (I‚Äôm not super sporty but open to new things).

Ideally, I‚Äôd love to connect with someone around my age (I'm 33F) with a similar Mon‚ÄìFri work schedule and weekends off. I think it helps if we‚Äôre both looking for similar kinds of accountability, but I‚Äôm also happy to support your own goals ‚Äî whether that ranges from watering your plants to even starting your own business.

‚ú®Ô∏èHow I see it working:

Meet in person regularly at the beginning

Later switch to text/call check-ins once we‚Äôve built a good rhythm or keep it in person

Start with a quick chat or call to see if our goals and vibes align

If this ressonated with you, dm me,let me know a little bit about you and where you need support and see if our goals align :)

1myzv7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1myzv7x/how_slow_is_too_slow_in_christian_dating/,How slow is too slow in Christian dating?,"I met a guy online and we started chatting and sending voice notes every day and multiple times a day through the dating app. This went on for a little over a week so I suggested we exchange numbers. I suggested it not him. This is a yellow flag. We started talking on the phone and we talk about God, our faith, tv shows, our upbringing, work, everything. We want the same things in life and appear to be aligned. Again we will send each other voice notes all throughout the day sometimes multiple 8-9 minute voice notes just talking about life and everything in between. This is our daily interaction. We've shared a lot with each other. We also realized that we actually only live 5 minutes away from each other. We are practically in the same neighborhood. But at this point it's been a month of daily chatting but at no point has he suggested we meet? Again, we live a few minutes away so we can take a walk together, grab coffee. We can even meet in the parking lot of the nearest supermarket. The point I'm making is there's no reason why we haven't met. There's plenty of opportunity. I'm wondering why he is not asking to meet. Whats the hold up?

You may say well why didn't you ask? Well I asked to exchange numbers earlier on when he didn't so if I have to also ask to meet, it just feels like I'm doing the heavy lifting to move this forward and I want and expect some intentionality from the other person. When I brought it to his attention he said he didn't know I wanted to meet. He didn't want to rush. I'm just thinking ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù. Tell me if I'm crazy but why wouldn't I want to meet after a month of daily conversation and you live 2 Street lights down. I didn't say hey become my boyfriend. But is it unreasonable to expect to meet someone that lives 5 minutes away after a month of daily conversation of expect that meeting to happen within a week or two rather than a month. I've meet men much faster than that and they lived farther away. Also it sound like he was over explaining and trying to say well if I wanted to have a conversation about the next phase, we could've done that. I'm just thinking ü§î ‚Äúa conversation‚Äù. Its not that deep, if you wanted to meet me, you would say ‚Äúhey lets meet, when are you free?‚Äù. I never had to have a drawn out conversation about whether now is the time to meet. Dude you live down the street. 

My conclusion is that he likes the conversation,  the encouragement, and the support from me but he's not that interested. It shouldn't take all that. Any man that is interested in me was eager to meet me and it didn't take all this conversation and nudging to get him to say yea sure lets meet. Come on.

1myzuoe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myzuoe,Pairing Chronicles #225: Cigar Federation + Boddington's,"It's been insanely hot around here and though there are some scary rainstorms every now and then, they barely last for more than 20 minutes. So it gets hotter and more humid. But at least when the sun goes down it kind of freshens a bit and late afternoon is the perfect moment to have a cigar and with a beer, even better. 

I got this cigar from Cigar Federation, as they usually have some very decent and very limited blends. The Queen of Hearts comes with a San Andr√©s maduro wrapper over Nicaraguan binder and Honduran filler, with very nice flavors of chocolate, caramel, cinnamon and coffee. The Boddington's beer might not have been the best pairing choice, but at 32¬∞C I couldn't complain.

It's a blonde but pretty robust ale I liked a lot because it was creamy and frothy, and coated the palate before each drag. ",5,1756052186.0,cigar_refuge,3,1.0,False
1myzuke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1myzuke/aita_for_not_going_to_my_brothers_engagement/,AITA for not going to my brother‚Äôs engagement?,"I (30F) didn‚Äôt attend my brother‚Äôs engagement, and now my family is upset with me.

For context: I grew up in a dysfunctional home. My dad was physically abusive, and my mum was emotionally absent ‚Äî she only ever cared about her ‚Äúsons.‚Äù I‚Äôm the youngest, and while all my siblings have moved on with their lives, I feel stuck. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years trying to work through the neglect, grief, abuse and trauma.

When I finally found someone I wanted to consider for marriage, my brother refused to chaperone a simple coffee meeting. Relatives then made awful, awkward comments to the guy‚Äôs family, which ruined things. These comments from my family cut really deep, and I spend therapy sessions unpicking them.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt want to pretend we‚Äôre a functional family to impress my new sister-in-law‚Äôs family. We are very dysfunctional, with years of abuse. Smiling through it would have been a lie, and I couldn‚Äôt do it.

Our family is dysfunctional in the sense that no one actually speaks to each other. We don‚Äôt eat together, we don‚Äôt spend time together ‚Äî we only pass each other in the house by accident. There‚Äôs no real parental bond, no sibling relationship, nothing.

Moving out isn‚Äôt a real option either ‚Äî in my culture, it‚Äôs seen as insensitive/taboo for an unmarried daughter to leave home, even though I‚Äôm financially independent with a great job. What I want is simple: to marry and have happiness. But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not even worthy of it.


AITA for not attending the engagement party?
