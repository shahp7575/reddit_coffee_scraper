The last few days have been pretty chill. Nothing too terrible. But this morning, I woke up feeling The Big Sad partnered with an intense rage towards everything. 
I manage a small coffee shop located in a business tower. A lot of the clientele I see are “busy businessmen”. 
But this man came in, on his phone, and just mouthed his order to me. But didn’t give any actual necessary information. So when I had to ask clarifying questions, he mouthed the answers at me. Then put his money on the register. I give him his order and he mimes “bag” at me. JUST GET OFF YOUR FUCKING PHONE. It’s seriously not hard to tell the person on the other line “hey give me just a sec” 
I feel like they’re gonna complain to my bosses and I’m going to get another talking to about being “perky and welcoming”. 
Yay luteal me. I don’t know this demon. ",1,1758204655.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

I have memories of Italian shots that tasted good without milk or sugar (they were amazing with that sugar cube that comes with).  I'd like to get to an equipment and bean combo where I can have a shot at home without needing to add milk.  I've been trying some lighter grinds and it appears I prefer darker roasts.  I know many people recommend the DF54 and 64, but the YouTube reviews seem to indicate the flat bur is better for light roasts.  I can't seem to convince myself I want to pay what it costs for a Niche or a Timemore Sculptor.  The Baratza ESP Pro is $75 more than DF54, but is it significantly better for my tastes?  I really wish I could find something used on FB marketplace or even eBay, but haven't seen much on FB in my area.  I do eventually want a better espresso machine, hopefully used, less than $1K.

1nk9bgr,https://i.redd.it/3uecq48nkxpf1.png,[Free for a year] Discover What Affects Your Sleep with Reverie (and more),"Hey r/iosapps, I’m a solo dev who’s been pouring my heart into Reverie, a sleep optimization app, and for the next 48 hours, I’m giving away a 1-year subscription.

I’ve always found the Apple Health sleep graph confusing. It's hard to tell if sleep was really good and how its been over days and months.. I was also curious about how things like workout timing, steps walked, daylight exposure, or even dinner schedules affect my rest. For instance, I thought morning workouts were the key to great sleep, but my data showed noon-to-5pm workouts help me crash harder. Surprise!

I also wanted to nail down the best dinner time, AC temp, or whether those supplements were helping or hurting my sleep (magnesium actually helps). And when I’m wiped out, I needed a way to confirm it’s just sleep debt piling up -- not me Googling “why am I exhausted” and spiraling (you know the vibe).

I tried other sleep score apps, but they never matched how I *felt* after a night’s rest. So, I spent weeks fine-tuning an algorithm for **Reverie** that feels fair and personal, using Apple Watch data to make sleep optimization simple and real (**it also works with garmins and the like** \-- as long as it tracks sleep components like deep sleep).

Here’s what Reverie does:  
😴 **Sleep Score (0-100)**: Turns your Apple Watch data (stages, duration, consistency) into a daily score that vibes with how refreshed you feel.  
🛌 **Personalized Sleep Need**: Analyzes your patterns to pinpoint exactly how much sleep *you* need.  
📉 **Sleep Debt Tracker**: Shows how short nights stack up and guides you to recover before you burn out.  
🔎 **Factor Analysis**: Connects the dots between workouts, steps, coffee, supplements, or daylight exposure to reveal what’s helping or tanking your sleep.  
📅 **Routine Builder**: Set habits like dinner or coffee time, get feedback on their sleep impact, and tweak to find your perfect flow.  
📊 **Analytics Hub**: Dive into a sleep calendar, bedtime consistency streaks, and graphs of your best bedtime or fun stats (like steps or meditation minutes) over 1, 3, 6, or 12 months.  
🌙 **Discover Your Best**: Find your ideal AC temp, dinner/coffee cutoffs, and bedtime--all driven by your data.

**Who’s it for?**

* Sleep trackers who want clear sleep insights (using Apple watch, garmin, whoop, aura etc)
* People curious about how daily habits shape their rest
* Fans of clean, intuitive apps that make health feel empowering

I’ve been coding solo, so this is a true passion project. For the next 48 hours, grab Reverie and get a **1-year subscription free --** no strings attached! I’d love to hear your sleep struggles or what you’re curious about with your routine. Drop a comment!

1nk98x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1nk98x5/requesting_a_refund_from_our_venue/,Requesting a Refund from our Venue,"I got married a couple of weeks ago and our venue messed up so many different things. The morning of the wedding was so unbelievably stressful because the venue coordinator created so many issues for us that I had to fix on my own and I wasn’t able to even be in the getting ready suite all morning/afternoon with my family and friends and we had to multiple times push back my hair and makeup because I didn’t have time.

We’ve paid $18,000 so far and our remaining balance is $13,000. I’m wondering what we should ask for in compensation. That is for 100 guests for venue fee and food and drinks ($310 per person) so it was certainly not cheap.

In terms of issues, I’ve tried to summarize as much as possible:

I had booked a special mini mobile pub that was going to be a surprise for my husband and let the coordinator know. On the way to the walkthrough, I emailed again to remind her that it was a surprise. The second thing she said when we were there is where would we like to put it right in front of him.

Due to thunderstorms, we were told it was unsafe to have people under tents and that they would need to shelter on the bus. Because of this, we decided with the venue coordinator to shift our ceremony to be a half an hour earlier. For the time change, we were told that the coordinator would contact the bus from the hotel for us to see if they could move the timing - we then could not even find the coordinator at the venue to find out what was going on with that and my mom had to go and wander around the venue searching for her. We found her phone sitting on the counter in the getting ready space with multiple missed calls from me and the hair and makeup artists had said that had been there the entire day since they had set up. When we did find her, she said that she couldn't get in touch with them and asked if we had any additional info. We were able to find a number that they had specifically for weekend hours in emails but the fact that there was no sense of urgency in coming to see us and asking us this once they had initially not responded is something I can't wrap my head around. On top of this, we were not offered any help in contacting our other vendors including the photographer and musicians/officiants and smaller hotel shuttle buses. We were left to contact everyone on our own when we needed to be spending that time getting ready. It ended up postponing our schedule with the hair and makeup artists and we had to give them an additional tip for staying later with us. 

When we had discussed the rain plan the day before, we discussed the different tent options. They recommended 3 tents but we were never told that we wouldn't be able to fit everyone for a ceremony under the two tents when we decided that would give us more flexibility if it didn’t rain. We had to figure out a ceremony space in the morning of the wedding where we ended up adding extra seats for guests in a different area off to the side since we had no other option at that point. We were then told that since the coordinator had scheduled other walkthroughs they didn't have any more time to speak to us when we hadn't even had a chance to ask about other things that still needed to be coordinated.

We were also told the morning of the wedding that our seating chart would need to be rearranged because the two rows of tables that we had planned needed to be split into four quadrants. I had to call my husband to shift things since I didn’t have time with everything else going on. We were then later told that it was solved and the tables would be able to be all in a row, but upon entering the dinner space we noticed that this was still not the case on one side and multiple couples were separated at different tables as a result.

My husband and I were never asked a single time by any staff if there was anything that we needed or anything that could be grabbed for us

We were told on the walkthrough that any wine we wanted for the girls getting ready could be provided but I had to send my friend to wander around the venue to track down some champagne for us to toast with two hours before the ceremony. We had not been asked all day if we needed anything

My friend was actually asked to get my husband and I a plate of appetizer food because “none of the staff had time to do so”

My grandma didnt have a seat - we said another guest by the same first name wasn’t coming and they removed my grandma instead (I double checked that we specified the correct last name in the text)

As I was told to head another location prior to the ceremony, we were walking there right past the mini pub at the same time that my husband was exiting and heading to his location. We were literally right next to each other and had to be shielded with umbrellas for him to not see me. (We didn’t do a first look so we hadn’t seen each other). Additionally, my uncle walked up to me seconds before I was about to walk down the aisle asking where he was supposed to sit because there were no seats left.

Multiple of our vendors specifically mentioned to us that they were never once asked if there was anything that they needed or anything someone could grab them. When the makeup artist asked if there was any water she was told to get it herself. One of our friends was helping to grab the officiants/musicians anything they needed and they said how odd it was that not a single person from the venue had talked to them or offered to do so.

There was one bar at the venue in addition to the mini pub that I was surprising my husband with. For some reason, they didn’t serve any beer at the main bar only the pub and when we were in there for our private vows multiple people were coming up and trying to come inside because they wanted beer which they couldn't get at the main bar and we had no idea we were preventing them from getting any. The beer was also half the cost of the cocktails and wine and was located much further from the dinner (the main bar was inside with the dinner tables).

The hand painted place cards that my friend had made for us that people were excited to take home with them were cleaned up before the event was even over. 

There was no coffee station provided in the dancing tent (this had been comped for us from other mess ups leading up to the day).

Our getting ready space was changed last minute and we were not told the new getting ready space had no ac

We were also never informed that cake was being served or offered any or asked if we wanted any to be saved. We never even saw or tasted our own wedding cake and multiple people noted that they were upset that they didn't know to get any.

The part that we are the most upset about is the dinner time changing. We were never informed that if we pushed the ceremony timing that would mean that the dinner time would need to change and we would have never agreed to this. We had reviewed with the coordinator multiple times that we wanted the dinner time to be 7:30 since it was later than typical. The coordinator tried to change the dinner time from 7:30 to 6:15 during the event. When we pushed back (we still hadn’t even done photos yet), they said the latest they could start dinner was going to be 6:45 at which point we were informed by a staff member that we were supposed to go around and ask people to sit down at our own wedding. We specifically wanted a later dinner to have longer at our cocktail hour for photos and this was especially important on our day as we had to wait for the rain to let up to start getting photos. We also had planned out the timing of our dinner and timing with our wedding date to have the lighting at dinner look the way that we wanted since it was outdoors. Our singers and DJ were also transitioning at that time and there would have been no music at the dinner if our DJ didn’t happen to be there early. Our DJ contacted us saying that since the timing changed, he would have to charge us for this extra time and we provided him with a tip to make up for him being so flexible.

They also tried to charge us tip and admin fee and sales tax on things that were comped on the final bill.",1,1758204372.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

1nk94zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1nk94zg/stocking_question/,stocking question,"I work in Market. When doing pulls, it will oftentimes have me pull more of an item than will actually fit on the floor. 

For instance, the other night, my device asked me to pull six of Stok iced coffee. It indicated ‘out of stock on the sales floor’ but it had me pull 6. Only 5 fit on the floor though. So if the device ‘knows’ that it’s out of stock on the floor and only 5 fit, why would it have me pull six?  

The one that is worse is when they have me pull 48 cans of pumpkin filling when I know there is only room for 30 or something like that. It’s to the point where if there is a really large number I will only pull half as a hedge. I will actually walk the department when I begin my shift to look for these types of things. 

This happens a lot and it is frankly a waste of my time and more importantly (to them!) a waste of Targets money. I would much rather spend less time doing pulls and more time organizing and zoning the shelves, looking for expired food (embarrassing when a guest will point out that a yogurt expired three months ago) so Market doesn’t look so ghetto (no team lead right now and our store is absent about half its management positions).

[https:\/\/pdxint.at\/47OnPEH](https://preview.redd.it/zpo22prahxpf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e0f274e6525035e12f761a467856da190c46cbd)

Hello and happy Thursday Victorians!

As is now traditional, we have the early look at the changelog before our next release. Where, *National Awakening* and Update 1.10 **release on September 23rd**, alongside this we will have the accompanying patchnotes too.

Before then, however, we continue our tradition of naming each update after tea, this time we named it ‘Kaffee’.

Moving swiftly, and subtly on, last week we had the inaugural GDFIX Day on Discord. Where Martin and a crack team of devs decided to take community suggestions for small fixes, balance changes and more that could be done within one day. This resulted in 33 fixes, 34 if you count Martin submitting one to himself to fix himself… 

Regardless, we really enjoyed the community interaction and feedback from this and will look to do more of these in the future, so stay tuned for more information about them in the future. These will be coming in a hotfix after the release of Update 1.10, but you can see the list of fixes [here](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/gdfix-day-is-approaching.1858550/).

Without further ado though, welcome to changelog, we got fun and games!

# Features of National Awakening

https://preview.redd.it/m0e0dpkjhxpf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72b9da5e0fba1c197876a5d58c36d2a657c20686

* Added Journal Entries for organising the United States of Greater Austria. Upon forming a Dual or Triple Monarchy and researching pan-nationalism, one may endeavour to form the USGA through the Federal Solution Journal entry and integrating enough cultures within the Empire to form the USGA
* Added a decision and event chain for transforming the Austrian Dual Monarchy into the Triple Monarchy through issuing a Trialist Manifesto. Issuing this Manifesto permits creating a third, more cooperative crown in Croatia to offset Hungary - at the cost of a potential conflict with Hungary.
* Added a Journal Entry (The Ständestaat​) for organising Austria into a Corporate State. With the rise of mass politics in Austria, the Corporatist Movement seeks to end democracy in favour of the “Ständestaat​”
* Added narrative content and a Journal Entry pertaining to the Great Eastern Crisis
* Added several Events and Journal Entries for Russia and Austria to interact with the Great Eastern Crisis
* Added a starting Journal Entry (The Age of Metternich​) to Austria, themed around the twilight years of Klemens von Metternich. This Journal Entry focuses on his objectives of maintaining the Austrian monarchy, maintenance of the Austrian sphere, and promotion of the arts and sciences
* Added a new building set for the Balkan region, including completely new 3D models for the Rural and Urban Residential, Farm, Civic, Port and Forestry buildings. Port and Forestry in particular have received a huge overhaul, showing much more information to the player on the map about their selected production methods. The building set also includes reskins of the currently existing Factory and Mining Models to help them fit better with the rest of the new Balkan buildings
* Added historical Austrian emperors and heirs past game start date, along with several events pertaining to the affairs of the Habsburgs.
* Added a Journal Entry and associated events pertaining to the Hungarian revolution
* Added historical uniforms to Austrian, Hungarian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, and Montenegrin generals, monarchs, officers, and soldier pops
* Added a Journal Entry for developing one's national identity as a Balkan state
* The Balkan League may now be created as an alliance between Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and (if they exist on the map) Bulgaria. Ottoman subjects may be added as de facto members. These nations receive various options to represent their militarization. Should they win the Balkan War, they may then turn on each other to retake their homelands
* Added loading screens for National Awakening
* Added new pop and character clothing, including outfits for Greek Fustanellas, Balkan Hajduks, late-game winterised uniforms, and early-nineteenth century tailcoats
* Added a Journal Entry simulating Montenegro's dependence on raiding to feed and clothe their people, with associated events. This can, with some difficulty, be upscaled to create a warlike nation set on destroying the Ottomans, but the Great Powers will not approve
* Added a Journal Entry for Montenegro to stop (or at least reduce) raiding and modernise their laws in an effort to appeal to the Great Powers for more land from the Ottoman Empire
* Added a Journal Entry for the Ottoman Empire to deal with Montenegro's raiding and to reward players for crushing the rebels once and for all
* Added a series of events reflecting the history of Montenegro's rulers and the dramatic transition from Theocracy to Monarchy
* Added the Throne of Thorns Journal Entry for Serbia, covering the conflict between Obrenovič and Karađorđević dynasties over the Serbian throne
* Added a Journal Entry for Montenegro and Serbia to combine into a single nation if they share borders, reflecting the history of Montenegrin rulers at the time considering themselves Serbs
* Added the Prussia of the Balkans Journal Entry for Bulgaria, covering Bulgaria's rapid militarization following its independence from the Ottoman Empire
* Added a Journal Entry for the formation of Yugoslavia
* Added a new 3D building representation of Hagia Sophia
* Added a Sausage Platter table asset, with Kolbász and some lovely pickles
* Added a Bugbear Flask table asset, a carved coconut to carry your gunpowder in. Created by sailors on their voyages home
* Added a Chibouk Pipe table asset, with matches depicting a certain Basil…
* Added a Coffee Cup table asset, alongside Turkish delight
* Added a new Austrian coin, based on a Maria Theresa thaler
* Added the Gründerzeit Journal Entry to the game, valid for all German nations
* Added the Autocracy in the Age of Liberty Journal Entry to Austria, along with associated events
* Added 'Bavarocracy' as a new starting Journal Entry for Greece
* Added 7 new companies to the game
* Added new custom Interest trait names and traits to the game for German, Romanian, and Hungarian nations
* Added content related to the 1873 Vienna World's Fair

https://preview.redd.it/mi55zzlzhxpf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30d5a7758c861c296d0a27ce74c04c9d8bbe8478

# Features

* Reworked discrimination traits on Cultures and Religions. Cultures now always have a heritage and language trait each. These both belong to a wider family of similar traits. Cultures can also have tradition traits, which may change over the course of the game. Religions now have a defined heritage trait similarly to Cultures. As a consequence of this, many modifiers, triggers, effects and historical setup have changed
* Cultures now have Cultural Fervor, which acts as a measure of how much a culture has come to identify with a single national identity
* Added a new hostile Diplomatic Action ""Support Separatism"" that will increase Movement Pop Support Attraction and Movement Activism for Cultural Minority Movements of one’s Primary Cultures in a target country
* States now have an ""Obstinance"" value which, when high, gives penalties to the state's cooperation with the country's government
* Added the ability to edit a Prestige Good's name next to the Goods button (*Charters of Commerce*)
* Many nation-specific Journal Entries can now be previewed from the Sandbox map while selecting a country, giving players an indication of the historical content available to each nation. A maximum of three journal entries are displayed
* Added an ""African Diaspora"" ethnicity

1nk8usv,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1nk8usv/xcel_november_25_honeymoon/,Xcel November '25 Honeymoon,"My fiancé and I are going on our honeymoon aboard Xcel departing on November 30th, 7 nights to the Caribbean. We were super excited to find out it's a brand new ship! The ports will be Puerto Plata, Charlotte Amalie, and Philipsburg. We are not cruisers, but I got into the idea after going on an Alaskan cruise last year and finding it super relaxing. This is our first time on Celebrity as well, so I'm looking for some guidance on a few things cruise-related and port-specific. 

We booked 9th floor midship Prime Aqua Class- What was your favorite part of having this class? What is something we should definitely take advantage of?! What other tips or tricks should we be aware of when cruising on Celebrity in general? 

Packages: What would be a good deal for Premium Alcohol and/or Wifi? I have been doing some research on here and get that it's based on price point, not percentage off, but what are the actual good prices for each? 

For wifi, we don't plan to be on our phones much (definitely want to disconnect), but would like it for emergencies and/or occasional streaming a movie in bed. Is cell service at the ports/islands good? We have considered buying wifi passes on cruising days instead. Did you find the wifi package worth it, or were buying day passes and using cellular at ports sufficient? 

For Premium Alcohol- on average, we anticipate drinking 3-5 drinks at night, maybe more on cruising days. Is it worth it to buy a package based on our consumption, or pay per drink? We are big coffee drinkers, so we anticipate using it for that too. 

Port excursions: We want these to be fun! A beautiful beach day, catamaran sailing, snorkeling, good food, and a splash of adventure are our goals. We are in our mid-30s and definitely want to make this the most fun and adventurous part of our trip. 

Puerto Plata, Charlotte Amalie, and Philipsburg-- What were your favorite excursions and who did you book with?? When I went to Alaska, I found it easy and cheaper to book directly with local port vendors. Is that the same at these ports?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nk8or0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Farhanamili/comments/1nk8or0/stable_flat_bottom_pouch_the_perfect_blend_of/,Stable Flat Bottom Pouch: The Perfect Blend of Functionality and Style,"In today’s packaging industry, innovation is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Businesses across the globe are searching for packaging solutions that not only protect their products but also appeal to modern consumers and align with sustainability goals. Among the many advancements in flexible packaging, the **stable flat bottom pouch** has emerged as a revolutionary choice. Often referred to as a box pouch, this packaging design combines the best qualities of stand-up pouches and gusset bags. With its sturdy base and structured design, it provides superior shelf presence, storage efficiency, and durability. As industries ranging from coffee and snacks to pet food and personal care continue to grow, stable flat bottom pouches are becoming the go-to option for brands looking to balance functionality, style, and environmental responsibility.

One of the most defining features of the [**stable flat bottom pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/flat-bottom-bag) **is its excellent shelf stability and space efficiency**. Unlike regular pouches that may tip over or collapse when partially filled, the flat bottom pouch is designed to stand upright securely, even after repeated opening and resealing. This not only makes them more attractive on retail shelves but also enhances convenience for consumers who store them at home. The pouch’s structure allows it to hold more product without compromising shape, maximizing storage and reducing the need for bulkier packaging alternatives like boxes or tins. For retailers, the neat, upright display ensures better shelf organization, while for consumers, it means easy handling and minimal mess. This unique combination of form and function makes the stable flat bottom pouch a practical solution for products that demand both visibility and reliability.

https://preview.redd.it/a45odgsagxpf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf1cd50b145f2f897775b3e87be550d74e0c5416

Beyond stability, **customization options for flat bottom pouches give businesses a powerful branding opportunity**. Packaging serves as a silent salesperson, and with the flat bottom pouch, companies can leverage five printable surfaces: front, back, two sides, and the bottom panel. This extensive printing area offers ample room to showcase logos, product details, nutritional information, and striking visuals. Advanced printing techniques such as digital, rotogravure, and flexographic methods enable brands to create high-quality, attention-grabbing designs that resonate with their target audience. For instance, a premium coffee brand can incorporate minimalist matte finishes and bold typography to highlight sophistication, while a snack brand may use vibrant colors and playful graphics to appeal to younger consumers. This ability to tailor packaging to align with brand identity enhances shelf impact, boosts consumer recognition, and increases the likelihood of purchase in competitive retail environments.

The rising popularity of **stable flat bottom pouches is also closely linked to sustainability**. In today’s market, eco-conscious consumers demand packaging that minimizes environmental harm without sacrificing quality. Flat bottom pouches require less raw material than rigid containers, resulting in reduced production waste and lower carbon emissions during manufacturing and transport. Many suppliers now offer recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable materials for these pouches, helping businesses align with eco-friendly initiatives and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, their lightweight structure reduces shipping volume, lowering fuel consumption and logistics costs. This combination of economic and environmental benefits makes stable flat bottom pouches an ideal choice for companies aiming to meet consumer expectations for sustainable packaging while maintaining profitability. By embracing this eco-friendly solution, brands position themselves as responsible market leaders in an increasingly environmentally conscious world.

Looking toward the future, the **stable flat bottom pouch is set to play an even greater role in packaging innovation**. With advancements in materials, features, and technology, these pouches are becoming increasingly versatile. Functional add-ons such as resealable zippers, one-way degassing valves for coffee, tear notches, and transparent product windows are enhancing consumer experience and usability. At the same time, digital printing innovations are making it more cost-effective for small and medium-sized businesses to create personalized pouches in smaller batches, reducing waste while ensuring professional results. The pouch’s adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of industries beyond food, including pet care, pharmaceuticals, and household products. As businesses continue to prioritize convenience, branding, and sustainability, the stable flat bottom pouch will remain a top choice for packaging solutions that deliver both style and substance.",1,1758203034.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False
1nk8obn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nk8obn/reveal_how_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Reveal How the Best Espresso Machine Breville Bambino Plus Performs,"The Breville Bambino Plus BES500BTR1BUS1, with its sleek Black Truffle finish, immediately caught my eye. I'm picky about my coffee machines, and this espresso maker promised a café-quality experience in the comfort of my tiny kitchen. Over the past month, it’s been my morning companion, and trust me, we’ve become quite well-acquainted. Now, let me walk you through what my time with this product has been like.

**DESIGN AND SIZE**  
A big part of why I chose this espresso machine was its compact footprint. Measuring just 7.5 inches wide and a little over 14 inches deep, it’s ideal for smaller kitchens like mine. It doesn’t demand much counter space, so there’s still plenty of room for my cutting board and spice rack. The minimalist design feels modern but functional, and the Black Truffle color adds a classy vibe that doesn’t overpower my kitchen’s aesthetic. Its sleek buttons are intuitive, and the machine just radiates build quality. However, while I loved its size and premium look, the 11-pound weight made it hefty when I needed to move it for cleaning.

**FUNCTIONALITY AND PERFORMANCE**  
This is where the Breville Bambino Plus began to shine. Equipped with the ThermoJet heating system, it reaches the right extraction temperature in a mind-blowing 3 seconds. Good coffee in record time? Yes, please. It also features a low-pressure pre-infusion system that gradually increases the water pressure, and honestly, it made a noticeable difference in flavor balance. Each cup tasted consistent, rich, and smooth. The customizable milk frother was an unexpected highlight. It automatically adjusts temperature and froth levels, helping me perfect latte art like a wannabe barista. My friends were equally impressed after I demoed its functions during brunch.

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Compact footprint without sacrificing performance  
- Adjustable automatic milk frother for microfoam texture  
- ThermoJet system heats up in just 3 seconds  
- Pre-infusion guarantees flavor consistency in each cup  
- Intuitive control panel for ease of use  

[Check Breville BES500BTR1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08zk13cjn/)

**STRENGTHS**  
Few things stand out as much as its quality-focused features. The automatic microfoam texturing is a boon for anyone who enjoys experimenting with lattes and cappuccinos. The consistent 54mm porta-filter ensures optimal coffee grounds for a balanced taste. The auto-purge function is another feature that seems small but adds significant value—it resets the heat system after steaming, so each espresso shot is brewed at the perfect temperature.

- Microfoam texture suitable for latte art  
- Simple maintenance with the auto-purge feature  
- Compact design perfect for small kitchens  

**SHORTCOMINGS**  
No product is perfect, though, and this espresso machine isn’t without its flaws. One downside is its reliance on a fully manual operation for refined results. While it offers some automatic settings, getting the grind size and tamp pressure just right can be frustrating for beginners. Also, the included milk jug feels somewhat cheap compared to the rest of the machine. And though it’s a fully automatic espresso machine, I do wish it came with a built-in grinder like some competitor models.

- Manual operation could be intimidating for newbies  
- The milk jug’s quality feels underwhelming  
- No integrated bean grinder  

**PERFORMANCE AGAINST COMPETITORS**  
Stacking the Bambino Plus against competing models like the De'Longhi Dedica and Gaggia Classic Pro highlighted its edge. Where De'Longhi excels in user-friendliness, it lacks the precise controls of Breville's temperature and frothing. The Gaggia offers similar customization but feels bulkier and outdated in comparison. Unlike both competitors, the Bambino Plus stands out for its super-fast heat time and compact footprint, making it a fantastic choice if space and speed are priorities.

**VALUE FOR MONEY**  
The price gave me pause initially. With espresso machines, you're paying for the engineering behind features like consistent brewing and advanced frothing systems. The Breville Bambino Plus BES500BTR1BUS1 certainly isn’t cheap, but its features justify the price tag for coffee enthusiasts or anyone who wants café-quality results at home. Compact, efficient, and stylish, it strikes the balance between affordability and premium performance.

A small group of us (about 10 people) are meeting this Saturday, 4–6 pm at Blue Tokai, Eastern Canal Road, Racecourse for something I’m calling Cuppa Convos.

It’s really simple—phones away, mugs up, and just genuine conversations. To help us get started, I’ll bring along a few light prompts—think fun icebreakers or reflective questions that make it easier to move past small talk. Nothing heavy, just stories and voices we don’t usually get to hear. 

You only pay for what you order at the café.

If this sounds like your kind of Saturday, you’re welcome to join! We also have a small WhatsApp group to stay in touch—drop in if you’d like to be part of future circles. Link in the comment. ",3,1758202779.0,Dehradun,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Next Tuesday (23.09.2025) at 16h CET, I’m doing an AMA! 

I recently stepped into the role of Strategic Partnerships Manager at Favikon, and I want this to be a space where future partners, creators, and anyone curious about what we’re building can ask me anything.

A little look into my career journey :

\-The launch of my first big project with Favikon: the new Favikon Partner Program !

\-What it looks like behind the scenes of building partnerships at a SaaS startup

\-How we’re planning to support creators globally-My own career journey (from international diplomacy → creator events in Paris → SaaS partnerships)

Some personal facts about me:

\-Lived and worked across Paris, Dakar, Oregon and South Dakota

\-I summited Mount Kilimanjaro.

\-Ran multiple creative community events in Paris (vision board picnics, creator networking afterworks, “soft clubbing” brunch parties).

\-Obsessed with coffee culture and building meaningful community spaces



I love connecting with people in the industry and those that want to break into it - creators, big and small, agencies, brand marketers and who ever is curious.

I'd show screenshots, but I've been having so much difficulty in trying to get them posted here, so here is the convo in copied/pasted text form...
(I can supply a link if that's allowed; she made it a public post after all.)

--

Her post:
I am who I am because the I AM tells me who I am ❤️

My original comment:
Be who you want to be because YOU want to be.

Her:
no ma’am! I am who HE says I am!

Me:
So much for that ""free will"" then...

Her:
I am a child of God and I have free will. I choose to be who He says I am because that is the best version. He isn’t making me, I am willing and available.

Me:
That still doesn't sound like free will, like, at all. It's a sense of false justification and heavy dependency.
Like, hypothetically, free will implies you have the option to NOT ""be willing and available."" So my question is this: would you even consider the opposite of accepting him? If your answer is along the lines of ""no,"" then it was never free will to begin with since it implies you would only ever go with God's side blindly without forming your own path in life on your own terms, 100%. Instead, you ""need"" him in your life or else you fear about some mysterious evil unknown, and you claim that you simply ""want"" it. And even a shred of doubt or question is perceived as ""omg Satan is making me think that; save me God!""
Honestly, whenever I see religious people say stuff like ""God shapes my life"" or whatever, it always gives vibes of trying to remain in an abusive relationship. He ""loves"" you, but you stay because he tells you ""if you don't, then you'll pay hell (literally) for it.""

Her:
I follow Him because He saved my life. I was on the floor with a razor blade pressed against my wrist, seconds from making one move and leaving this world. Leaving my kids without a mother. Leaving my husband a widow. So my answer to your question is No. I would never consider not following Him. And no one can ever talk me out of it. And yes I need Him and want him. Oh and trust me, I don’t doubt or question how good my God is. And I do have the free will to walk away but I won’t. I can’t after everything He has done, everything He is.

Me:
Sorry, but not only does that prove that Christians don't have (or even know what is) free will, but the whole ""he saved me"" trope is very redundant among theists. It actually makes a weak argument in supporting how he ""saved"" you. I'm sorry that point in life happened to you, but not giving YOURSELF that credit of not resorting to end yourself is, no offense, pathetic. Like, didn't he put you in that low of a state to begin with? I guess you can call it like a ""test of faith"" or whatever Christians like to call it. Again, that doesn't sound so loving to me, but more of a manipulation tactic in order to get you to say how wonderful he is; it's very common in toxic relationships to mainly benefit the manipulator while giving the victim a false sense of love and belonging (in this case, he brought you to that mental state because you must've lapsed in faith or something so that happened for you to love him more for his own benefit so you'd give him praises even if it traumatized you). To put it lightly, it's the whole ""I was about to push you off a cliff, but I didn't, so I saved your life, so you owe me now"" analogy. Your response is a textbook definition of how abuse victims think and act towards their abusers. ""I love him because he says he loves me even though he put me in life-threatening danger."" Or do you only give him credit for anything good happening and any negatives are simply dismissed or rerouted to ""evil."" Seriously; no one thinks God causes starving kids or car accidents or terminal illnesses. Just when kids are fed, cars are running again, or overcoming illnesses--even though, in the background, it's families, mechanics, and doctors who are the ones truly making that possible, not some invisible deity in the sky. If you think God is the one doing the good in the world, simply sit and don't do anything and see what happens.
Sorry, but if God even exists, he's definitely no all-loving savior and deserves no credit for any of my accomplishments in life that I worked for my own self.

Her:
I will not continue to go back and forth with you on here. If you ever want to grab a cup of coffee and chat, let me know.

But what if I told you that instead of staring at your screen in despair, you could be cashing in on that screen time with AI? 💡 Let’s flip the script from “doom” to “DOING” with three super exciting AI monetization plays! 

### 1. **Content Creation that Sells**
Have you ever thought about how many blogs or social media posts you scroll through daily? Yep, that’s a goldmine! 💰 With AI tools, you can generate high-quality content in minutes (think Jasper or ChatGPT). Not only that, but you can niche down and cater to specific audiences! 

- **Why not start a blog or an eBook?** (Everyone’s got their story to tell!)
- **Freelance your writing skills!** (Consider it your side hustle!) 

Imagine getting paid to write while sipping your coffee, crunching numbers like a boss, through the power of AI! ☕✨

### 2. **Automation for Passive Income**
Ever heard of passive income? It sounds like magic, but it’s totally real! 🪄 Use AI to automate processes in your business or side projects. Whether it’s scheduling social media posts or creating personalized email marketing campaigns, this stuff takes you from “Hustle 24/7” to “Chill & Still Earn.” 🏖️

- **Create an AI-driven subscription service** (like newsletters, coaching, etc.)
- **Sell AI-generated digital assets** (like art or templates) on platforms like Etsy!

Imagine waking up and seeing dollar signs in your inbox because your systems are finally working for you instead of the other way around! 🎉

### 3. **AI Tutoring and Online Courses** 
Feeling that itch to share your knowledge? Use AI to create and promote online courses or tutoring sessions! Your expertise can become someone else’s ticket to success. 🎓 

- **Record video tutorials** and use AI tools to create polished content easily.

1nk8eub,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1nk8eub/discover_if_the_best_air_fryer_from_chefman/,Discover if the Best Air Fryer from Chefman Really Delivers Crisp Meals,"I’ve spent the past couple of weeks testing out the Chefman RJ38-2T-BLACK, and I must say, this compact air fryer worked its way into daily life quite seamlessly. I’m someone who loves quick, hassle-free meals without compromising on taste, and this little gadget promised to deliver just that. With a countertop footprint smaller than a cereal box and an array of thoughtful features, it piqued my curiosity from the get-go. Here’s how it fared after rigorous testing, a few experiments, and some casual kitchen chaos.

**Space-Saving Design and Build**  
This mini air fryer is a godsend for people like me with limited kitchen space. Its sleek, narrow build fits neatly between my coffee machine and toaster without a fuss. The 2-quart capacity may sound small, but it’s surprisingly enough for a hearty solo dinner or quick snacks for two. The square basket design optimizes the space inside, allowing everything from frozen chicken nuggets to fresh zucchini fries to cook evenly. Although it's light at just under 6 pounds, the all-plastic exterior felt sturdy when I moved it around during my notorious counter clean-ups. Visual appeal matters too, and the minimalist black finish doesn’t scream for attention but blends right into the kitchen aesthetic.  

**Ease of Use and Touchscreen Controls**  
The appliance's touch control panel is delightfully intuitive. There’s no steep learning curve; even my tech-averse uncle could manage to whip up crispy fries without calling me for backup. The digital display allows you to set both time and temperature, going up to a maximum of 400°F. I found myself experimenting with different foods, from reheating leftover pizza to roasting chickpeas. Even better, it’s equipped with a unique shake reminder that pings halfway through your cooking. That little alert saved my sweet potato wedges from turning into leathery regrets!  

[Check Chefman RJ38-2T-BLACK price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0dc11yh4j/)  

**Healthy, Fast, and Crispy Cooking**  
What stands out most about this air fryer is its ability to cook food faster than my oven while using little or no oil. Thin slices of eggplant turned crispy on the outside while staying soft within, and frozen mozzarella sticks were golden and gooey in under 10 minutes. The reduced need for oil really clicked for me when I realized my go-to fries didn't have the usual greasy residue afterward. Despite its smaller capacity, the even heat distribution ensured no piece was left cold or soggy. This gadget might not replace a full-size fryer entirely, but its speed and cooking quality pack a real punch for everyday meals.  

**Good Aspects**  
• Space-efficient design without sacrificing function.  
• Touchscreen controls with temperature and time customizations.  
• Shake reminder ensures evenly cooked results.  
• Healthy cooking with very little oil.  

**Shortcomings**  
• The 2-quart size isn’t suitable for families or larger portions.  
• Exterior surface warms up slightly during cooking, so caution is needed.  

**Cleaning Made Easy**  
What I despise most about cooking is the aftermath, but cleanup with this compact fryer? A total breeze. The aluminum basket comes with a nonstick coating, and I happily tossed it into the dishwasher alongside last night’s pasta bowls. For the days when my dishwasher was practically groaning with dishes, a quick soapy rinse was all it took. The nonstick surface means no scrubbing, no cursing at stuck crumbs—just low-effort, minimal-maintenance bliss.  

**Safety and Reliability**  
This air fryer doesn't just stop cooking at a set time; it also shuts off automatically if the basket is removed, which is both clever and reassuring in a house filled with distractions. My cousin, who is notorious for accidentally leaving appliances running, gave this feature her enthusiastic thumbs-up. The handy cETL safety certification further added to my confidence in letting it run even when multitasking with other chores.   

**Alternative Offerings**  
If a petite air fryer isn’t quite your thing, there are rival products to consider. For instance, the Ninja 4-Quart Air Fryer shines with its larger capacity and a few advanced presets, but it’s bulkier and takes up more counter space. The Instant Vortex Mini is another close competitor for compact kitchens, with slightly finer-tuned temperature controls, though I found its learning curve steeper than the Chefman. While larger fryers might cater better to families, this 2-quart model is perfect if you’re prepping a quick meal or snack for one or two people without rearranging your entire countertop.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given the advanced safety features, reliable cooking performance, and compact design, the Chefman RJ38-2T-BLACK offers excellent value for its price range. Larger air fryers might tempt big families, but then you’re looking at more cleaning and higher electricity costs, not to mention losing valuable counter real estate. This small marvel does exactly what it promises—fast, healthy, and delicious food—without burning a hole in your wallet or overwhelming a small kitchen. For someone new to air fryers or with limited space, this product feels like a true smart spend.

1nk8ent,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsAreStupid/comments/1nk8ent/purpose_of_life_that_makes_humans_different_from/,purpose of life that makes humans different from animals,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Came home from a long, shitty day at work yesterday and since I have so much to do, I ended up putting my kiddo to bed and then doing three hours of work from home. Went right to bed. Woke up, got my kiddo ready and drove him to school. Walked back in my front door and my plants caught my eye. 

Wilting a bit. Haven't been watered in probably two weeks because I'm so busy. Haven't even really thought about them much. And I just started crying.

What's the point of being at work all day and then coming home to a messy house I have no time or energy to clean, doing more work, not spending time with my son, not doing any hobbies. Of course I barely make any money, so it's not like I can afford a day off. And the office must be a mess right now without me (I answer the phones, do the quoting and invoicing, design our products, do the manufacturing files, schedule the installs). 

But I just can't today. I don't want to. I cried, I did the dishes and cleaned my kitchen. I made a coffee and drank it hot. I'm out on my deck listening to the birds. I'm actually outside in the fresh air during the day, seeing the sun! 

I just hate this. I wish I had a partner that lived with me, or living parents/family. Or enough money to survive a little better. I need a new job ASAP but the market is dead as hell, especially in a small town, and for someone like me who only really has child care during school hours. 

I'm tired. I'm trying to relax and not worry about work, to actually recharge on this day off, but of course the anticipation of my workload tomorrow is giving me anxiety anyways. 

Thanks for listening, the birds out here don't understand me. Neither does my boss. ",25,1758202263.0,breakingmom,6,1.0,False
1nk8dau,https://i.redd.it/pp3ayr3cdxpf1.png,5 platforms that kickstarted my SaaS app and solo startup journey,"A few months back I was grinding at my 9–5 job at a private marketing firm. It felt more like being chained to my desk than actually living life. No time for family, no time for friends — just endless work.

On top of that, I had this bad habit of subscribing to every new AI tool that launched. Before I knew it, I was bleeding money on subscriptions I didn’t even use anymore. One random morning, I saw charges for tools I had completely forgotten to cancel, and that was the lightbulb moment.

I decided to fix the problem — first for myself, and maybe for others too. So, after a few weeks of learning and building with tools like Expo, VS Code, and Bolt (plus marketing on X and Instagram), I launched a simple [subscription tracker](https://www.subscriptiontrackerapp.com/) app. It tracks all recurring payments, sends reminders before charges hit, and has an analytics dashboard to actually understand where your money is going.

 In just 15 days, the app has gotten 300+ downloads and 4 paying users — $17 MRR. It’s not life-changing money yet, but it’s covering my coffee, and the fact that people are paying for something I built blows my mind. I am glad its solving a major problem of users.

Honestly, I already feel freer than I ever did in that 9–5 grind.  ",2,1758202253.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False
1nk8d36,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1nk8d36/im_withholding_affection_and_i_dont_know_how_to/,Im withholding affection and I don't know how to stop.,"
Lots of context so tldr: I don't give my bf the same affection I used to. I had to stop certain things so that I could feel comfortable around him and it's lead to almost nothing being available. 

Together 8 years, declining since year 3 and is now totally dead because of me. He has ADHD which makes him not be interested in sex most of the time.

Let me start by saying I grew up with a family that only hugs on special occasions such as birthdays and big life events. Even when my siblings and I try to hug or physically comfort eachother it's weird as fuck. 

Giving affection was really hard for me to do and still is. It has be a conscientious decision I make. When we first started dating it was like whole new world for me, of just giving affection for affections sake. Acting on small ideas for it, letting him give me lots of affection. 

About last year, I had to take sex off the table until he gets his ADHD managed (I'm very helpful, I keep track of appointments and take him when I can and make sure he takes his medication) and if wanting to have sex is something that comes along then great, we can go from there.

 A couple of months of nothing I broke and tried to initiate. He kissed me on my forhead and told me he had to take a shower. 

Later that day he tried to initiate and I completely recoiled from him and hid my face under a blanket. I swear it when I say I didn't even realize I did that until I was under the covers. So I took sex off the table because I was so confused. 

Over the years I've taken things off the table until we fixed things  like he couldn't grab/smack my butt, touch my boobs at all or kiss/touch my neck. Only spooning if I'm the big spoon. No more play fighting and no more tickle fights. All this would make me want him and then I'd feel gross and deeply ashamed because why couldn't I just accept it. 

Why couldn't I just clock that I was horny for him and move on? No id get sad and then ashamed. I'd get these body aches for him and it made me sick. I'm looking to maybe go to therapy to deal with the shame aspect. 

He brought up that I don't wake him up with kisses, caresses or jumping on him anymore, I don't bring him coffee so we can drink it and chat in bed. (He doesn't need me to wake him up I just would.) Now I just open the door and tell him I made coffee. I used to hug and kiss him and be silly before I left for work, now I just call out the I love him and leave. I didn't even realize I was doing that. 

He pointed out that I no longer kiss his face or ask for face kisses. There's more examples unfortunately. It's just that I don't even think about it, I don't remember to remember to do it. I don't even get the urge to do it at all. 
He also said we don't shower together anymore and that I hide myself from him. I used to hang out in a T-shirt and underwear but now I'm always in pyjamas. If I forget something when I'm gonna shower I put on a towel or my clothes back on. I just find it more comfortable to do this stuff. 

After the recoiling incident I asked that we just cuddle softly and nicely, like leaning on each other and holding each other. I also asked to just do pecks on the lips. I couldn't deal with it anymore and that I need to work on myself and find somewhere to get therapy. 

He says he's been having to ask for kisses and hugs from me and i do every time he asks. And I've been trying really hard to do it unprompted.

He says he wants to feel loved because physical affection is really important to him to feel loved and I'm not trying to do that for him. I hate that I'm not. I didn't even realize these things. It's not like I'm thinking ""I don't want to touch you or kiss you because you don't want to have sex with me"". . Never ever would I want to do that. But I am. I understand that physical affection and sex are two completely different things

I feel awful and I don't know what to do.  I can't fight feeling uncomfortable when I try after he's brought it up. I try to do it for him but I feel so awkward about it. 

Yesterday he was going to put his arm around me on the couch but stopped himself and I feel so awful. I've made him to touch me because of all the parameters I've set. 

I've made things so much worse. I hate being this way so much. I should have ordered my paragraph in better but I'm just ranting tbh ",3,1758202240.0,DeadBedrooms,4,1.0,False

1nk8cf2,https://i.redd.it/j7omvoaldxpf1.jpeg,"Beginner experimenting with iced pour-overs. Here’s my recipe, would love feedback.","Hey everyone,  
I’ve recently gotten hooked on iced pour-overs and wanted to share my current recipe with you all. I started with hot pour-overs and also loved cold brews at one point, but I find that the cold brew seems to lose a lot of aroma for me. With iced pour-overs, I feel like I get the best of both worlds - fruity notes and a refreshing cup, without it being *too* cold.

Here’s my recipe:

* 12 g coffee
* 50 g ice
* 115 ml water
* Brew method: V60
* Grinder: Timemore C2 (sweet spot around 17 for most beans I’ve tried)
* Water temp: \~92–94 °C
* Attached the photo of the coffee I am currently uisng

Brewing: Two Pours

* 1st pour: 40 ml for bloom (0:00–0:45)
* 2nd pour: remaining 75 ml of water

Taste-wise, I can mostly pick up the big buckets (sweet, sour, bitter) and whether it’s fruity, but I’ve started getting a feel for adjusting grind size when the cup feels off, which definitely feels like progress.

Would love to hear your thoughts on:

* Anything I can tweak with my ratios/timing?
* Tips for improving aroma without making it too cold?
* Any small adjustments that helped you early on?

Really curious to see how others approach iced pour-overs, so I can keep learning and experimenting.",1,1758202199.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

“Badge.”

The guard’s visor reflected nothing but my own pale face back at me. They kitted him out like he was going to storm Huế: flak vest, pistol holstered at his hip, M16 slung against his chest. I slid my badge over.

“Yu Li.” His voice was muffled behind his respirator. He slipped the badge into the reader mounted on the wall. It gave a dry click and a green bulb buzzed. “Clear.” He returned my badge and I stepped through the turnstile.

The hallway beyond was concrete painted in an eggshell green, the floor sloping downwards at a shallow grade. Fluorescent lights in iron cages buzzed overhead. Every thirty paces or so, side corridors marked with stenciled numbers and a security detail at each intersection. Up ahead, at a door marked *C-12* over the lintel, a man shuffled out, clutching a stack of green-and-white printouts against his chest. “Morning, Dr. Li.”

“Warren.” His shirt collar was drenched in sweat and his eyes were bloodshot. “You look like hell.”

He huffed out a laugh. “Been staring at line-feeds for fourteen hours. The raster libraries keep dropping frames once the glyph density crosses sixty percent.”

“Did you implement the double-buffer routine I left in the stack last week?”

“Yeah. But the glyph matrices aren’t uniform. Some of those symbols render at forty-eight by sixty-four, others spike past a hundred pixels in height.”

“Then you need variable-length descriptors. Treat the bigger glyphs like sprites instead of characters. Allocate them dynamically.”

“Dynamic allocation’s a pipe dream unless you want to crash the whole system.”

I sighed. He wasn’t wrong. Half the lab was already running kludged-together overlays just to keep the framebuffers from seizing. “Alright. Then preprocess the oversized glyphs into bitplanes. Chop the outliers into quadrants and stitch them on display refresh.”

Warren’s eyebrows shot up. “That might actually work. Expensive on cycles, but it buys us throughput.” He shifted the stack of papers higher under his arm. “Anyway, Dr. Langstrom’s been asking for you.”

I sighed. “Of course he has. Thanks for letting me know.”

The corridor widened into a large room. The ceiling arched higher here, corrugated steel bolted over concrete ribbing, halogen lamps glaring down in cones of light. Forklifts groaned between rows of pallet racks stacked to the rafters. On them were reels of magnetic tape, CRT monitors shrink-wrapped in plastic, and various grey metal cabinets. I threaded between them, tracing the painted walkway that ran down the warehouse floor. At the far end, a blast door stood open, revealing a narrower corridor. I flashed my badge at the guard without breaking stride. His visor tracked me but he didn’t speak.

Beyond the blast door, the noise fell away. The walls were the same shade of institutional green but lined with thick glass panes behind which technicians hunched over terminals. At the end of the corridor was another steel door. A small brass plaque simply read: *DR. H. LANGSTROM, PROJECT DIRECTOR*. I knocked on the door and entered.

Cables sprawled across the ground, bundled into racks of humming tape and oscilloscopes that blinked with steady green light. Langstrom stood hunched over a drafting table, tie loosened, sleeves rolled past his elbows.

“Jezebel?” He didn’t look up.

“No, it’s me, Yu. Who’s Jezebel?”

“No one. Nevermind. Come on in.”

I stepped over the cables and let the door shut behind me with a pneumatic hiss. The hum of the machines filled the room. Langstrom appeared to be sketching out one of the glyphs again.

“Why were you asking for me?”

Langstrom lifted his head finally. His eyes were rimmed red when he met my eyes. “I want you in Observation with me. I was waiting for you to get in before we initiated it.”

“Observation? Surely you can’t be serious. The raster stack still hangs if you try to push more than thirty seconds of continuous render.”

“Thirty seconds is all we need.” Langstrom took a sip of the coffee he had sitting on the drafting table. It had long since gone cold. “Thirty seconds is enough to spike a cortical load. The EEG pulls show entrainment starting within the first twelve. Alpha collapses into theta almost instantly, and by twenty-five we’re straight into delta.”

“When was this reported?”

Langstrom pawed through a clutter on top of a filing cabinet and pulled free a folder filled with carbon copies. He handed it to me. “Page nine.” I flipped through it and skimmed the report. He was right.

“I didn’t know we were already on the testing phase.”

“Come on. I’ll show you.” He swept past me, lab coat flaring, and I followed him out of his office. The corridor bent hard right and opened to a security station with two guards in full kit. The guards’ eyes flicked to our badges and then they stepped aside. Beyond the door, the Observation Wing stretched like a half-moon of thick glass overlooking a theater-like chamber. Rows of terminals lined the glass, each manned by techs in white shirtsleeves. Their ashtrays were crowded with butts. Down below, in the chamber itself, a subject sat strapped into a steel chair under a halo of electrodes.

Langstrom’s hand clasped my shoulder, squeezing harder than necessary. “Run it.”

I nodded and slid into the operator’s chair. The tech to my left flicked into an overflowing tray and muttered, “Dr. Li, the raster library’s preloaded. All you gotta do is punch it.” I entered the command and the CRT bolted to the gurney in front of the subject blinked from blank green to a scatter of glyphs.

At first, the subject just squinted. Then, around ten seconds later, his whole body jerked. The EEG monitors spat black ink across their rolls of paper. He thrashed against the restraints. The chair bolted to the floor groaned with each pull. The leather straps began to split. He tore his right arm free first, skin sloughing raw where the cuff bit into him. Blood dripped down to the tiles. He ripped his other hand loose, then the leg straps.

“*Somebody call security!*” One of the techs barked.

The subject staggered to his feet, eyes rolled white. He slammed his head against the concrete wall. First a dull thud. Then another. Blood ran down his face, spattering the wall. His skull split with a sound I’ll never forget. He didn’t even scream. Just kept slamming, harder, faster, until the wall itself was smeared dark and his body crumpled twitching to the floor.

The observation room went still. Only the sound of the EEG printers chattering on. One of the techs started heaving and gagging. The guards finally entered the chamber below, rifles raised, but it was pointless now. The subject was nothing but a broken heap on the tile, skull cracked like a dropped melon.

Langstrom stood motionless for a few moments. “Well, shit. That’s never happened before. Shut it down. Get the body to Disposal. Run the tapes again and flag any irregularities.”

I shoved out of the chair so fast it nearly toppled. I grabbed Langstrom’s arm and hauled him a step back from the glass. “Be honest with me. Why the hell did you rush this to testing? You knew we weren’t ready.”

Langstrom looked past me to the smears of blood on the walls. “Dr. Li, listen. We don’t have the luxury of waiting. The Director has been breathing down my neck. He wants something tangible. If we can’t deliver, they’ll shut the project down.” He straightened his tie. “Come on, let’s go back to my office. I want to show you something.”

I didn’t argue. The last thing I wanted was to keep standing over the bloodbath like we were spectators at a prizefight. I followed him out. When we reached his office, Langstrom shut the door, twisted the deadbolt, and pulled the blinds down over the narrow glass pane. “Sit.” He didn’t wait to see if I obeyed. He moved straight to a tall filing cabinet in the corner. He tugged open the top drawer, rummaged past sheaves of carbon copies, and pulled out a bundle wrapped in oilcloth. He laid it on the drafting table and peeled the cloth back. Inside were a stack of journals that looked centuries old, their spines cracked and splitting. The spines read *Los Diarios de Don Johan de Jesus Nerón*.

“The Tatonga Cave glyphs were just the foundation. The glyphs found in these journals are variations. Don Johan, the founder of this town, understood the system and built upon it.”

I gingerly lifted up one of the journals. “Where the hell did you even get these?”

He lit a cigarette, drew deep, and exhaled. “They’ve been passed hand to hand for centuries. The first documented sighting was in Veracruz during the War for Independence. Later on, Prussian officers catalogued them in Königsberg. The Nazis stole them in ‘41. And then a colleague of mine in Berlin smuggled them through the wall in ‘62 and sent them back here.”

I thumbed through the journal, careful not to tear the pages. The pages inside were brittle, the ink browned to a rust-red that almost looked like it could have been written in dried blood. There was cramped Spanish and a mix of the glyphs that looked similar to the ones being fed into the raster library. 

“If they pull the plug on this project, we’ll never have the resources to decipher the full sequence.”

I shut the journal and set it back down. “You want to push this further? After what we saw in there? How many lives are you going to risk to figure this out?”

“Risk is the crucible of knowledge, Dr. Li. Knowledge requires sacrifice.” Langstrom drew on his cigarette again and exhaled a slow stream to the ceiling. “They’ll thank us one day. When the sequence is complete. When they see what lies beyond.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

In the last months he helped me join his passion for MTG (Magic The Gathering), and we've been playing together with his cards and decks.
For my birthday he already told me that he wanted to gift me a deck of my own (wich he's building with singulars cards) and everything I may need to play, like sleeves, dices, box and a playmat.
While I was at his house the Amazon courier arrived with one of the gifts and so he decided to show me as a little sneek peak.
The thing that arrived was the playmat, but soon I noticed the art on it was probably made with AI. I think he bought it without  even thinking it might not be human made. (also he is not used to see a lot of AI ""art"") but i noticed quite fast.
The ""art"" was also cute: it was a cartoonish cat in a garden dringing some coffee.
I told him I thought that was AI made, and he looked offended as if i attacked him personally.
Today a proven with a site that the image was AI and he decided to keep the playmat for himself. So I told him that (also as a person who likes art and hates AI) I would have returned the playmat in order not to sponsor AI ""art"" purchase. He just told me he returned the playmat.
I'm scared he might be offendet or sad I didn't like the gift (and told him I wouldn't have used it).
I tried apologize and he says there's no problem, but I'm  really sorry.

B got a boyfriend, moved a few cities over, and now I rarely see her. I actually have not seen her since she moved. Now, the guy is already up to no good. She already told me things he has done that betrayed her trust, and then she goes and moves in with the guy, ok. 

So, she does “events,” where she gets paid to essentially be some sort of entertainment hour. Now, the talent she uses, I also have the talent, but we use it differently. She charges money for it, I don’t like to. It is spiritual work, and I never felt comfortable exchanging my gift for a price, because it is priceless. Her, on the other hand, has no issue collecting money from people. Also, I work two other jobs, have some issues with pain, so when I’m not working either job, or preparing to work at either job, I’m typically exhausted and just recharging for another day, letting my legs and feet rest. I’m heavy, and my body feels it at the end of each day. 

So to get me out of the house, I have to genuinely want to see someone or do something! Like badly! I miss her  so I texted her. Every time she texts me or I text her, she is always trying to persuade me to go to one of these events. It’s starting to not even feel like a friendship anymore, but someone just offering business proposals all the time. Like a salesperson! 

Also, I do not want to spend one of my ONLY days off working at an 8 hour event all day! She does not have a job so she does not experience this type of fatigue. I just feel like this is selfish! 

She asked me if I was free this upcoming Sunday, I said yes! Excited, hoping this is the chance to meet up! I was already dreading the travel, no doubt, but still willing. Then, she sends me yet ANOTHER flyer for an event! I felt trapped and set up! How could I think this girl wants to go get coffee and walk around the city and just chat with me? Of COURSE not! I’m starting to get the vibe she needs a photographer, or gets bored by herself for 8 hours sometimes. Last time, she sent me an event flyer that required MONEY to rent a space. She sent me the price list and asked if I wanted to do it with her. I haven’t even answered, this has been going on for months. She is glued to her boyfriend though. It seems he took my place, whereas all the things we would do together, she now does with him. And I am only good for a helping hand. 

Had to put this somewhere because this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth and I don’t even know how to feel. I’ve literally been grieving our friendship. ",1,1758201654.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with electric kettles since I've gone through quite a few of them over the years. After countless cups of tea and coffee, I think I've finally found the perfect one that actually lasts.

You know how frustrating it is when you buy an appliance and it dies after a few months? That was my story with electric kettles until recently. I've dealt with everything from slow heating times to weird plastic tastes in my water, and don't even get me started on kettles that stopped working right after the warranty expired.

What really matters in a reliable electric kettle is the heating element quality, temperature control, and build materials. I learned this the hard way after wasting money on cheaper models that couldn't maintain consistent temperatures or had flimsy power cords.

After doing extensive research and testing several models, I found an amazing electric kettle that ticks all the boxes. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. It's got a sturdy stainless steel construction, rapid boiling capability, and precise temperature settings that actually work.

The auto-shutoff feature is a lifesaver - no more worrying about leaving it on when rushing to work. Plus, the keep-warm function maintains your desired temperature for up to an hour, which is perfect for those who like to enjoy multiple cups throughout the morning.

What really impressed me was the quality of the heating element. It heats water evenly without any hot spots, and there's zero plastic taste. The wide opening makes cleaning super easy too, which helps prevent mineral buildup and extends the kettle's lifespan.

If you're tired of replacing unreliable kettles or want to upgrade from your basic model, I highly recommend checking out this one: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. It's been my daily driver for months now, and it hasn't shown any signs of wear or performance issues.

I use mine for everything from brewing coffee to making instant noodles, and it hasn't let me down yet. The temperature precision is especially great for green tea lovers who know that boiling water can make it taste bitter.

Bottom line - investing in a quality electric kettle pays off in the long run. It's worth spending a bit more upfront for something that'll last years instead of months. Plus, the energy efficiency of a good kettle actually saves money on your electric bill over time.

1nk813u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_beautifulmind8494/comments/1nk813u/custom_flat_bottom_pouch_a_modern_packaging/,Custom Flat Bottom Pouch: A Modern Packaging Solution for Brands,"In the competitive world of product marketing and packaging, businesses are always searching for innovative solutions that combine practicality, aesthetic appeal, and sustainability. Among the wide variety of flexible packaging options available today, the **custom flat bottom pouch** has emerged as one of the most versatile and effective choices. Also known as box pouches, these packaging solutions feature a sturdy flat base that allows them to stand upright while maximizing storage capacity. With their sleek design and efficient functionality, custom flat bottom pouches are being widely adopted by industries such as food, coffee, pet products, and even cosmetics. By combining functionality with customizable features, these pouches not only meet the growing demands of modern consumers but also give brands an opportunity to stand out in highly competitive markets.

One of the biggest advantages of **flat bottom pouches is their superior stability and storage efficiency**. Unlike traditional stand-up pouches, these have a reinforced bottom that ensures they remain upright on shelves, offering a clean and organized look in retail environments. The design also provides extra room for filling, making them ideal for products such as coffee beans, snacks, cereals, and powders. For businesses, this means more product can be packed into the same pouch size, reducing material usage and shipping costs. For consumers, the pouch’s sturdy shape makes it easy to handle, store, and reseal after opening. This perfect balance of functionality and visual appeal has made flat bottom pouches one of the fastest-growing trends in flexible packaging worldwide. **For more:** [**Custom Flat Bottom Pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/flat-bottom-bag)

Another defining feature of the **custom flat bottom pouch is its ability to be fully personalized for branding purposes**. In modern retail, packaging is not only about protecting the product but also about making a strong visual impression. Flat bottom pouches offer five printable panels—front, back, bottom, and two sides—that businesses can use to highlight their brand identity, nutritional information, product details, and eye-catching graphics. This large surface area ensures that even on crowded shelves, products attract consumer attention. Advanced printing methods, including digital, rotogravure, and flexographic techniques, make it possible to create high-definition designs with vibrant colors, matte or glossy finishes, and even metallic highlights. For premium products like specialty coffee or gourmet foods, this customization adds value by reinforcing the brand’s quality and story, creating a stronger connection between businesses and their customers.

Sustainability is another factor driving the popularity of **custom flat bottom pouches**. As consumers become increasingly eco-conscious, brands are expected to adopt packaging that reduces environmental impact. Flat bottom pouches require less material than traditional rigid packaging such as boxes, jars, or tins, which significantly lowers production waste and carbon emissions during transportation. Many manufacturers now offer recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable materials for flat bottom pouch production, allowing businesses to align their packaging with global sustainability goals. Furthermore, because the pouches are lightweight and space-efficient, they reduce shipping volume, cutting fuel usage and logistics costs. By choosing eco-friendly flat bottom pouches, companies not only contribute to environmental protection but also appeal to a growing segment of consumers who prioritize sustainable brands when making purchasing decisions.

Looking ahead, the future of **custom flat bottom pouches** is bright, as they continue to evolve with innovations in packaging design and technology. Their adaptability makes them suitable for a wide variety of industries, from food and beverages to pet care, pharmaceuticals, and household items. New features such as resealable zippers, one-way degassing valves for coffee, and transparent windows for product visibility are enhancing their consumer appeal. At the same time, digital printing innovations are making it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to order custom pouches in smaller quantities, reducing waste while maintaining professional-quality packaging. As consumer expectations grow, the custom flat bottom pouch offers businesses an opportunity to combine practicality, branding power, and sustainability in one package. It is not just a packaging option but a strategic investment that supports market competitiveness and long-term brand success.",1,1758201425.0,u_beautifulmind8494,0,1.0,False

- I work out for a minimum of 30 minutes with kettlebells, rowing machine, other home equipment and try to always take a walk after making my husband's dinner

- Spend my weekends rollerblading and hiking, as well as doing yard work

- I eat about 800-1200 calories at most per day and avoid all carbs and processed sugars. I dont even eat rice, I use cauliflower instead. In the morning I have an egg, a spoonful of cottage cheese and some kiwi, strawberry, blackberries, pineapple, the odd clementine. Lunch I will have pumpkin soup, homemade meatballs (no breadcrumbs) with cauliflower stir fry, a big salad with chicken

- Eat lunch by 2pm and fast until next day around 10 am

- I have completely cut out chocolate and snacks for over 2 months now, not having cravings anymore if I am hungry I will have a few almonds, sometimes popcorn that I make in an air popper with no oil or salt and I only eat maybe 1/2 cup for special occasions, like when my sister wants to go to the movies or something

- No pop, no take out, no Starbucks coffee, nothing but water and green tea or mint tea with honey

- I take berberine, creatine, coQ10, and a b complex

- have a rebounder I use morning and night for my leg swelling and a vibration plate I use when I get home from work just before working out because that's when it feels right and feels best on my body

Any advice, tips, ideas, I'm willing to try anything. I've been doing most of this stuff for over a year and I have gained at least 20lbs. I recently tried to only eat once every other day like I used to when I was young and broke but it mostly made me feel sick and bloated lol",1,1758201401.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False
1nk80fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/1nk80fx/from_marketing_to_data_analytics_any_advice_is/,From marketing to data analytics - any advice is greatly appreciated,"I’ve been shifting from digital marketing into a data analytics path, and I have found many differences between the two. In the marketing world, most of my work revolved around GA4, Looker Studio, paid ads dashboards, and Excel. In data analytics, BigQuery and SQL are part of the job description. I realizing that if I want to do anything beyond descriptive reporting, Python is going to be part of the ride. 

At the same time, I’ve noticed a lot of role titles can be misleading. Some companies call someone a “Marketing Analyst,” but they’re really building data warehouses and running statistical models, others expect GA4, campaign tagging, basic dashboards. That confusion makes it tough to know how much technical depth to prepare for without overwhelming myself.  

I've been preparing for interviews lately, and having coffee chat with some professionals. They said data analytics is, at its core, about asking the right questions and interpreting what the data says, and tools are just a means to an end. I think this is similar to some of my work in digital marketing. I participated in some mock interviews, and  practiced coding and did online mock with beyz. Currently I'm taking some coures of SQL and Python, but always feel caught off guard and still far from mastering it. 

Is there anyone from marketing and now is a data analyst? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",2,1758201380.0,digital_marketing,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

It just does not seem worth it tbh. If it releases in USA sometime, I might get an older Z10 on clearance.  

I think it would have been awesome if the focus would have been more on cold brew, especially nitro from the air. Take the Cumulus pod machine as an example. That would be very innovative, even if it would have cost more than the GIGA 10, or if Jura possibly releases it in their next flagship model. Yeah, I’m aware they have their cold sweet nitro kit, but actual nitro infusion from the brew unit itself dripping out with nitro cold brew would be truly next level.

1nk7yon,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nk7yon/uncover_if_the_best_countertop_microwave_from/,Uncover if the Best Countertop Microwave from Farberware Delivers,"Microwaves are such a staple in every kitchen these days, and I got my hands on the Farberware Countertop Microwave to see how it stacks up. Coming in at 700 watts with a 0.7 cubic feet capacity, this compact unit was built with small spaces in mind. Whether for dorm rooms, cozy apartments, or office spaces, it seemed like a functional little machine. Naturally, I wanted to see how well this microwave would perform in real-life daily use.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, I noticed its sleek stainless steel finish. It has a modern and minimal design, which fit perfectly on my kitchen counter without looking clunky. With dimensions of 12.99 x 17.3 x 10.14 inches, the size meant it wouldn’t hog counter space, and at 22.5 pounds, moving it around wasn't a Herculean effort. The LED display was crisp and bright, making it easy to read, and the grip handle on the door? A small touch that made opening and closing it very satisfying. Farberware also included a child lock feature, which my sister appreciated since her three-year-old thinks everything in the house is a toy.  

**Performance and Cooking Options**  
Once plugged in, I put it to the test by trying out various settings. This microwave provided ten power levels, which was plenty for anything from reheating coffee to defrosting chicken. I’ve always loved one-touch cooking options, and this one offered six of them, making items like popcorn and baked potatoes straightforward to prepare. There’s also the option to defrost by weight or time, and I found the weight option almost eerily accurate. The memory feature was a pleasant bonus since it let me save some custom settings, like my go-to soup heating time. While it took slightly longer to heat larger items compared to higher-wattage microwaves, for its size and wattage, it held its ground well.  

**Pros**  
- Compact size but potent cooking capabilities for smaller households  
- Sleek stainless steel design that is visually appealing and durable  
- Six one-touch options that make reheating or cooking common dishes effortless  
- The memory function added convenience when repeatedly heating similar items  
- User-friendly LED display and interior lighting for easy monitoring  

[Discover if Farberware Farberware is on sale at Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07vs476x8/)  

**Challenges**  
Of course, no product is without its quirks, and the same can be said for this microwave. As much as I appreciated its performance, there were a few snags along the way.  
- The smaller 0.7 cubic feet capacity made it challenging to fit larger dishes, which isn’t ideal for families  
- The max 700-watt power output meant slightly longer cooking times for certain meals compared to higher wattage options  
- The default beeping sound was louder than I expected, which caught me off guard during late-night snacking  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to models like the Panasonic NN-SN65KW or the Toshiba EM925A5A-SS, the Farberware stands out in its category due to its compact size and lower price point. The Panasonic offers a higher wattage and slightly larger capacity, while the Toshiba is equipped with additional features such as sensor cooking. That said, both alternatives typically occupy more counter space and come at a higher cost. For someone tight on space or buying this as an extra microwave for quick reheats, Farberware fits a specific niche with ease.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Spending wisely is critical, and I found this microwave to be a good balance of cost and features. While competitors in the mid-range price bracket might offer more premium features, this unit ticks all the boxes for users who don’t need extra gimmicks. If your needs are straightforward—compact cooking, fast defrosting, or preparing simple meals—this product delivers quality at an accessible price.

My first experience here happened to be a week where the deli was giving everybody free coffee, a fun surprise. As we sat at the tables and chairs, sipping coffee among the flowers, the owner began to open up the umbrellas to shade us and others from the sun.  This was just after his post about the $10k fine for changing the dismal concrete corner into a pleasant and welcoming space.

I mentioned the fine and then commented on the free coffee.  He excitedly spoke me about creating community.  I wish I could remember exactly what he said, but what I do remember is a warm feeling that in this hard world, a business was not grabbing every penny it could.  Instead, it was trying to be a good neighbor.

There have been posts here and other subreddits about the owner, calling him racist and accusing him of bigoted acts.  Honestly, I don’t know the truth.

I’m M/67. I am an introvert. College graduate. Married 45 years. Children and grandchildren.

For many years I battled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and pre-diabetes, none of it life-threatening, but concerning. I worked hard at good diet and exercise, but every year at my physical the lab work remained pretty much the same.

Three years ago my wife and I stopped attending church, asked to be released from callings and stopped paying tithing. Actually, we kept paying tithing, just not to the LDS corporation; each month we chose a good cause to donate to.

The next year, after we stopped attending, my lab work had improved quite a bit. The following year we resigned our memberships.

A year after resigning our memberships all of my lab results were in the good/normal range. 

I attribute the improvement in my health to getting rid of a major cause of stress and anxiety in my life. As I said, I’m an introvert so attending church was always stressful. Every Saturday afternoon I would start to get a knot in my stomach knowing I had to attend church the next day. That knot would last until the following Tuesday.

I want to point out that the stress of church was not only because I’m an introvert, it was also because I’m a kind, empathetic person and listening to people at church criticize, condemn, mock and belittle others was heart-breaking and very stressful to me. 

The bottom line is church was making me sick, and for me walking away was the best medicine. 

To answer a predicted question, no, I did not start drinking coffee. I don’t like it. No, I did not start drinking alcohol. I have no desire to. My diet and exercise habits really did not change; the only major change was eliminating Mormonism from my emotional diet and taking control of my own emotional and spiritual life.

The company’s product portfolio is not limited to one sector; instead, it caters to diverse industries such as coffee, tea, food, beverages, cosmetics, and even specialty retail. Each industry has unique packaging requirements, and MTPak leverages its expertise to deliver solutions tailored to those needs. For example, in the coffee industry, where freshness and aroma preservation are critical, MTPak provides resealable pouches with degassing valves to maintain product integrity. For food businesses, the company offers packaging designed to ensure extended shelf life while meeting food safety standards. This adaptability and industry-specific knowledge have allowed MTPak to serve both small businesses and multinational corporations with equal dedication. By understanding the challenges of each market, the company creates packaging that not only protects the product but also enhances its usability and consumer experience.

Looking ahead, MTPak continues to drive innovation in packaging by combining **technology, sustainability, and customer-centric design**. The company actively invests in research and development to explore new biodegradable materials, advanced printing methods, and packaging designs that meet the evolving demands of global markets. As governments worldwide tighten regulations on single-use plastics and consumers demand greater accountability from brands, MTPak’s vision for a greener future places it at the forefront of change. By helping businesses adopt sustainable practices, the company is not only supporting environmental preservation but also creating long-term value for its partners. With its strong focus on sustainability, customization, and functionality, MTPak is redefining what modern packaging can achieve. It serves as a shining example of how innovation and responsibility can come together to shape a more sustainable and consumer-friendly world.",1,1758200801.0,POSTcontentARG,0,1.0,False
1nk7rlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsItBullshit/comments/1nk7rlo/isitbullshit_you_will_stop_getting_sunburnt_on_an/,IsItBullshit: You will stop getting sunburnt on an organic fruitarian diet,"Recently saw a lady claiming humans are meant to be fruitarians and the only reason anyone gets sunburnt is because of our ""toxic"" diets. For example, she claimed that eating meat, dairy, processed food, drinking coffee or basically anything that isn't fruit will become toxic in the body, that your skin excretes this toxicity and that's what makes you burn. 

She stated she eats 10 bananas, 10 passionfruits and 4 mangoes for breakfast after heavy weightlifting and cardio sessions, then rides crazy distances on her bicycle in the blazing sun and NEVER burns, only tans. She also believes the sun is a source of life/energy and there's a sunscreen conspiracy. 

I used to be vegan but now I eat a varied omnivorous diet high in protein, plus I weightlift and my health has improved drastically (my dr was shocked by how much healthier I am now). Because of this I am skeptical but prone to falling for extremist diet theories and see no reason for her to lie. What are your thoughts?

I’m thrilled for them, but boy, the overwhelming sadness has hit me like a ton of bricks. I am just incredibly sad. We are very close and have an amazing relationship. When he was home, we talked all the time, sometimes for a couple hours at a time.  He’s funny, sensitive, and just great company. We both work hybrid remote and he’d often come down from his room during the work day and plop himself on the sofa in my office and just chat, and order lunch. On office days, we’d have coffee and chat as we scurried around the kitchen to get ready to leave. He’d have dinner with us most nights which was so great. So what I’m saying is, even though he is only be 90 minutes away, I will miss his daily presence and the day-to-day relationship with him that I have enjoyed for many years. FaceTime and texting can’t replace that. Before he moved, he commented to us that he wishes he could somehow combine both worlds, as he will also miss being a daily part of our family. As a parent, you can’t get much better than that. 

I know all the responses, that we will have a new relationship, this is how life is, we raised them to spread their wings, that I should be proud of all that he’s become and be happy for the relationship we have. I know and feel all those things and I know that I’ll look back on today and feel silly that I felt this way. And don’t get me wrong, I am ridiculously happy for him. I encouraged him repeatedly to move into the city and see life outside of our suburban bubble. But I’m also feeling sad that *this* particular part of our daily life has closed, and I feel like we’re already in the polite phone call and generic texts stage of the adult child / parent relationship. And I don’t like it. I miss the back-and-forth, the fun jabs, the work stories, and deciding what to order or make for dinner.  People telling me that now I have a fun place to visit is well-intentioned but unhelpful *at this moment*, as I don’t want to be a visitor in my son’s life, as I’m grieving the daily and fully present relationship that I had.

As someone who enjoys the ritual of brewing coffee as much as sipping it, this sleek and traditional coffee maker seemed like a perfect fit. Right out of the box, its polished stainless steel exterior gave a sense of durability and timeless elegance. Though the look is appealing, I found more beneath the surface worth diving into.

**Elegant Design with Daily Functionality**  
The coffee maker’s stainless steel construction is not just for show—it adds a touch of luxury to my otherwise chaotic mornings. Its traditional percolator design brings a nostalgic element while blending seamlessly with modern functionality. The compact size ensures it doesn’t dominate my countertop, measuring about 6.25 x 9.5 x 12.9 inches. Despite its lightweight design, clocking in at 3.6 pounds, it feels sturdy and well-made. Over time, the ease of cleaning became clear. Thanks to its sleek surface, I only needed warm, soapy water to keep it spotless. However, I did notice that avoiding abrasive cleaners was essential to maintain the gloss.

**Performance That Keeps You Caffeinated**  
For coffee lovers like myself, this percolator is reliable and efficient. Capable of brewing 2 to 12 cups of coffee, the automatic brewing process ensures I have my caffeine fix ready quickly—about a minute per cup. This speed is ideal when hosting guests or rushing to work. Once brewed, the coffee maker keeps the beverage warm at an optimal serving temperature. It's kept consistent and hot, which is particularly great during long, lazy weekend breakfasts with the family. 

**Key Features That Stand Out**  
The reusable filter is a highlight for anyone seeking to minimize waste. Not only does this reduce my need to purchase paper filters, but it also saves money in the long term. The indicator light, which signals when the coffee is ready, is a surprisingly useful feature. You’ll know exactly when it’s time to pour yourself a steaming cup without unnecessary guessing. I also appreciated that the internal components, including the perk tube and basket, are constructed from stainless steel rather than cheaper materials like aluminum. This small detail ensures durability while contributing to the rich coffee flavor.  

[Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b00df5honi/)

**Benefits**  
- Durable stainless steel construction that resists rust and adds elegance.  
- Versatile brewing capacity, customizable from as few as 2 cups to 12 cups.  
- Keeps coffee piping hot automatically without additional steps.  
- Indicator light removes guesswork, ensuring perfect timing.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Requires regular cleaning to maintain the stainless steel shine.  
- Non-immersible body makes thorough cleaning slightly less convenient.  
- The power cord, while removable for storage, could be longer for more flexibility.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other models in its category, like the Farberware Stainless Steel Percolator, the Presto offers a more polished appearance and sturdier internal components. That said, the Farberware model allows for dishwasher-safe cleaning, making it more convenient in some respects. Similarly, the Hamilton Beach Coffee Urn boasts higher capacity but lacks the traditional aesthetic appeal of this product. While those competitors have their strengths, the harmonious blend of design, performance, and durability makes this coffee maker excel, particularly for someone like me who values form just as much as function.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given the combination of features and build quality, the price point feels competitive. While you might find cheaper percolators, they often skimp on materials, leading to compromises in durability or taste. This machine is worth the investment for its reliability, aesthetic appeal, and user-friendly operation. If you’re someone who prioritizes value without cutting corners on quality, this percolator fits the bill perfectly.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

Discover the 5 best apps for personal wellbeing and self-improvement in 2025. BeFreed leads with AI-powered personalized growth.*

## Introduction

**Feeling lost is more common than ever.** Whether it’s the stress of work, the overload of information, or the uncertainty of where life is heading, many people are turning to technology for support. The good news: in 2025, the **best apps for personal wellbeing and self-improvement** do more than just track habits or remind you to meditate—they actively guide you toward a healthier, more fulfilled life.

At the top of this list is [**BeFreed!**](https://www.befreed.ai/), a personalized AI learning app built by a San Francisco–based team. BeFreed doesn’t just summarize content—it creates a growth roadmap tailored to your mood, struggles, and aspirations. In this post, we’ll explore BeFreed and four other standout apps to help you feel grounded and grow stronger in 2025.

## What Are Personal Wellbeing and Self-Improvement Apps?

**Personal wellbeing and self-improvement apps** are digital tools designed to help you enhance your mental health, build better habits, and pursue lifelong growth. In 2025, these apps often combine **AI personalization, mindfulness practices, and habit science**. Instead of offering one-size-fits-all advice, they adapt to your lifestyle—making change more sustainable.

## 5 Best Apps for Personal Wellbeing and Self-Improvement in 2025

### 1. BeFreed – AI-Powered Personalized Growth Companion

BeFreed isn’t just another self-help app—it’s a **personalized learning and wellbeing platform** that adapts to the way you think, feel, and grow. Unlike meditation-only apps (Headspace, Calm) or habit trackers (Fabulous), BeFreed blends **psychology, productivity, and personal growth knowledge into customized podcast episodes, flashcards, and immersive video summaries.**

**Key Features:**
* **Personalized AI podcast feed** tailored to your energy, struggles, and goals.
* **Host customization:** Choose a voice and tone—serious, calming, or conversational.
* **Immersive video mode** for topics like resilience, history of wellbeing, or leadership.
* **Knowledge blending:** Episodes merge insights from top books, research, and talks (e.g., *Atomic Habits*, TED Talks on resilience, APA research on happiness).
* **Adaptive learning roadmap** that updates as you progress.

**Why It Stands Out:** Traditional self-help apps focus on either habits or mindfulness. BeFreed combines **knowledge depth with personalization.** For example, one session on managing burnout might merge lessons from *The Happiness Advantage*, neuroscientific studies on stress, and insights from leaders like Arianna Huffington. It feels like a cross between a therapist, coach, and professor—all in your pocket.

Because it’s **San Francisco–based but globally relevant**, BeFreed is used by young professionals in New York, students in London, and entrepreneurs in Singapore. It transforms downtime—commutes, workouts, coffee breaks—into meaningful growth.

**Pricing:**
* Free basic tier
* Premium: $12.99/month, $28.99/quarter, $89.99/year (3-day trial included)
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 2. Headspace – Guided Mindfulness and Meditation

Headspace has long been a leader in digital mindfulness. In 2025, its library spans thousands of meditations, sleepcasts, and short breathing exercises.

**Features:**
* Meditation for focus, stress, and sleep
* Sleepcasts for relaxation
* Daily mindful “check-ins”
* Animations for beginners

**Why It Stands Out:** Best for people seeking **guided calm** and stress relief. However, it doesn’t provide the adaptive learning journey that BeFreed offers.

**Pricing:** $12.99/month 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 3. Fabulous – Habit Building Made Fun

Fabulous uses behavioral science to help you create sustainable habits. Its app design feels like a personal coach nudging you toward routines.

**Features:**
* Morning/evening ritual builders
* Habit streaks and celebrations
* Gamified habit challenges
* Coaching programs

**Why It Stands Out:** Fabulous is strong in **behavioral nudges** and gamification. But while it motivates action, it lacks the deeper, personalized content of BeFreed.

**Pricing:** $10/month 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

### 4. Duolingo – Grow Through Language Learning

Language learning isn’t just about new words—it’s cognitive self-improvement. Duolingo’s gamified lessons now include AI tutors for deeper practice.

**Features:**
* 40+ languages with adaptive AI lessons
* Streak tracking and XP rewards
* AI-powered conversation practice
* Bite-sized daily learning

**Why It Stands Out:** Duolingo is fun and addictive, making **self-growth feel like play.** While not focused on mental wellbeing, it’s a great way to build discipline and brain health.

**Pricing:** Free + Premium tier ($12.99/month) 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

### 5. Calm – Rest and Sleep Reinvented

Calm specializes in **stress reduction and better sleep**. Its 2025 library includes masterclasses by psychologists, bedtime stories read by celebrities, and music for focus.

**Features:**
* Sleep stories and relaxing music
* Guided meditations
* Calm masterclasses on wellbeing
* Daily check-ins

**Why It Stands Out:** Ideal for those struggling with anxiety or sleep. But Calm focuses narrowly on rest, while BeFreed addresses broader self-improvement goals.

**Pricing:** $14.99/month 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

## Why BeFreed Is the Best Self-Improvement App

### Smarter Than a Self-Help Book

Self-help books are powerful, but reading dozens takes time. BeFreed distills the most relevant insights into **10, 20, or 40-minute sessions**—keeping nuance without overwhelming you.

### Built for Lifelong Growth

Unlike apps that solve one pain point (sleep, meditation, habits), BeFreed connects the dots: psychology, productivity, leadership, relationships, and more. It helps you become not just calmer, but **smarter and more capable in life.**

### Immersive and Personal – Not Just Wellbeing

BeFreed is unique in letting you **pick your host’s voice and tone.** For example, one user chose a calm, professor-like voice for studying, while another picked a witty, conversational voice for daily commutes. Combined with its AI roadmap, the experience feels alive, not static.

BeFreed’s mission is simple: to make humanity smarter, one personalized lesson at a time.

## How to Choose the Right Self-Improvement App

When picking a wellbeing app, consider:

* **Focus area:** Mindfulness (Headspace, Calm), habits (Fabulous), learning (Duolingo), or all-in-one (BeFreed).
* **Format preference:** Audio, video, text, or gamified challenges.
* **Personalization:** Do you want a one-size-fits-all routine, or an app that adapts like BeFreed?
* **Your goals:** Stress relief, building confidence, expanding knowledge, or overall balance.

For most people, **BeFreed provides the most holistic approach**—combining wellbeing and growth in one platform.

## Final Thoughts & Summary

In 2025, the best apps for personal wellbeing and self-improvement go beyond habit trackers or simple meditations. They personalize your growth journey.

Top picks:
1. **BeFreed** – Best all-in-one personalized wellbeing & learning platform
2. **Headspace** – Best for mindfulness and meditation

They are doing pretty well, earning a fabulous reputation in the coffee industry. However, behind the scenes, the owner has to spend literally a week each tax season matching bank statements and invoices (which are usually all over the place). Their business isn’t yet big enough to hire an in-house bookkeeper. The owner has to collect, match, and package the invoices before sending them to the contract accountant. They use Square for front-end customer sales management, which is not a problem. It’s the back-office admin that’s a pain — subscriptions, bean orders, equipment, staff purchases, etc.

It is literally a nightmare, as a small business owner's time is money. Do any of your successful people share a similar problem? Any suggestions on how to overcome this?",0,1758200254.0,smallbusiness,10,0.5,False
1nk7k94,https://www.reddit.com/r/combin/comments/1nk7k94/all_about_ugc_video_content_the_ultimate_guide/,All About UGC Video Content: The Ultimate Guide for Businesses and Social Media Managers,"User-generated content (UGC) has gone from a social media trend to a marketing staple. For businesses and social media managers, UGC video is especially powerful—it feels more real than polished ads and often converts better. Best of all, much of it comes from your customers themselves, saving your team time and resources.

In this guide, we’ll break down what UGC video is, why it works, how to encourage it, and how to repurpose it effectively with tools like [AI Video Cut](https://www.aivideocut.com).

# What Is UGC Video?

UGC video is content created by customers, fans, or independent creators—not your brand’s in-house team. You’ve seen it everywhere:

* A quick unboxing on TikTok.
* A casual tutorial with a new kitchen gadget.
* A customer review on YouTube Shorts.
* A testimonial posted to Instagram Stories.

Unlike brand-made campaigns, UGC feels raw and personal. It doesn’t rely on slick production or perfect lighting—and that authenticity is exactly why audiences trust it.

# Who Creates UGC?

There are two types of UGC creators:

# > Everyday Customers

These are regular buyers who post spontaneously. A TikTok of someone trying new sneakers, or a Shorts review of a phone case, falls into this category. Their motivation is usually excitement, self-expression, or the simple urge to recommend.

# > Professional UGC Creators

Freelancers who specialize in making authentic-looking videos for brands. They don’t always post on their own accounts—the company uses the content in ads, campaigns, or on social channels. Think: a paid creator making a “day-in-the-life” TikTok featuring a skincare product that a brand later runs as an ad.

# Why UGC Works for Businesses

# It Fills Content Gaps

When your content calendar looks empty, customer-made videos bring fresh ideas and new perspectives you wouldn’t have thought of yourself.

# It Saves Resources

UGC can reduce production costs. Unlike influencer campaigns, there’s often no need for product shipments, large budgets, or license fees.

# It Cuts Out Micromanagement

Because UGC comes from outside your company, you don’t need to run it through layers of approvals. You simply curate what aligns with your brand and reshare.

# It Proves Your Brand Works

If people are taking the time to create content about you, it’s proof your strategy resonates—even if your manager doesn’t see it.

# It Builds Trust

People trust people. A short clip of someone saying “this actually worked for me” can outperform a polished ad campaign.

# It Drives Engagement

UGC invites responses—comments, shares, duets, and spin-offs. This interactivity strengthens relationships with audiences.

# It Builds Community

Featuring UGC shows that customer voices matter. That sense of recognition fosters loyalty.

# Best Platforms for UGC Video

* **TikTok** – Viral challenges, duets, and stitches make it the most UGC-friendly platform.
* **Instagram Reels** – Strong for lifestyle-focused UGC. Brands often reshare Reels of customers integrating products into daily life.
* **YouTube Shorts** – Popular for reviews, tutorials, and first impressions. Great for products that require a demo.
* **Facebook & LinkedIn** – Not as trendy, but useful. On Facebook, UGC thrives in groups; on LinkedIn, testimonial videos can boost B2B credibility.

# How to Encourage UGC (With Examples)

Not every business has the brand power of Figma or Notion, where content appears naturally. Sometimes you need to give customers a nudge.

# 1. Run Hashtag Challenges

Create a branded hashtag and invite customers to join in.  
**Example:** ASOS’s #AsSeenOnMe campaign generated over 1.7 million posts across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

https://preview.redd.it/qawjmw4q7xpf1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9083cb12a78ddbdd9fdfc800219c0ed6d421f98

# 2. Offer Incentives

Giveaways, discounts, or even a chance to be featured can inspire UGC.  
**Example:** [LALAL.AI](http://LALAL.AI) ran a DJ giveaway offering credits for their app, resulting in millions of views.

https://preview.redd.it/kwqhzbuk7xpf1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b83c789c74e8dc9d5e33507da1e5c22d0990e5

# 3. Collaborate with Micro-Influencers

Creators with smaller audiences often produce the most relatable UGC and charge less.  
**Example:** A coffee roaster could partner with a food blogger to show different brewing methods.

# 4. Feature Customer Content

Resharing customer videos validates their effort and encourages others to join in.

# 5. Ask Directly

A simple request like “Show us how you use this” often works. Longer testimonials can be edited into short clips with AI Video Cut.

# 6. Use UGC Marketplaces

Platforms like Billo or Collabstr let you hire creators to produce UGC-style content, typically costing $150–$300 per video.  
**Example:** 4K Download uses marketplaces to fill their TikTok feed with authentic-looking content.

# Repurposing UGC Across Platforms

One video can fuel content across multiple channels with a little editing:

* Cut long reviews into short TikToks or Reels.
* Combine multiple clips into a YouTube highlight reel.
* Use snippets in ad campaigns for social proof.

With **AI Video Cut**, the process is straightforward:

https://preview.redd.it/ct5j23wt7xpf1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9372c8861663820a2cde0a7d21f3aaf4f625f3a

1. Upload a file or drop a YouTube link.
2. Select format, clip length, and number of videos.
3. Choose aspect ratio, captions, and language.

https://preview.redd.it/7vp6joiv7xpf1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=f000b43b61f84b2556510ab75237947186b93d4a

1. Submit, edit, and republish on TikTok, Reels, or Shorts.

AI Video Cut even generates captions and descriptions with hashtags, saving you extra time.

# Legal & Ethical Considerations

* Always ask before reposting customer content.
* Credit creators with tags or mentions.
* Disclose sponsorships or incentives.

Ignoring these basics can harm trust and credibility.

# Measuring UGC’s Impact

To evaluate UGC performance, track:

* Engagement (likes, comments, shares).
* Conversions and sales linked to UGC.
* Hashtag usage and brand mentions.
* Growth in followers or community activity.
* Product metrics like repeat purchases or higher retention.

Example: a clothing brand could monitor sales after posting customer “outfit of the day” Reels, while a B2B company might track leads generated from testimonial videos on LinkedIn.",1,1758200237.0,combin,0,1.0,False

My dilemma is this: do I lean into pure comfort (soft fabrics, stay-at-home friendly) or get something a little more versatile that I could wear on flights or coffee runs without feeling underdressed?

I know matching sets are having a moment right now, but I’m torn between buying for practicality vs buying for that Sunday-afternoon comfort.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

There are too many faces today.  
None of them hers.

Morning starts before the sun decides to be decent. Cold tatami under bare feet.  
The kind of cold that sits in the bones and makes them hum.

Rin Watanabe doesn't hum. Not when she's awake. Only on stage.  
And maybe, maybe in the shower when she forgets that she's *Rin Watanabe*.

January 12, 2015.  
Day off, supposedly.  
That's what the manager said—*""You've earned it, Rin-chan. Stay home, relax.""*  
She believed him. Idiot.

Phone buzzes.  
It's the ugly buzz, the one that means bad news, or worse fan gossip.  
Three messages from Kana in wardrobe. One from some number she doesn't know. All saying the same thing, different flavors:

Is this you?  
Did you really say that?  
Wtf Rin

She scrolls.

There it is.  
A photo.

Her.  
Except it's not.  
Too much eyeliner, wrong shape to the jaw if you tilt your head and actually look. But she's wearing *her* Stage 4 Winter Tour jacket the one with the custom gold embroidery. The one that, as far as Rin knew, existed in exactly one copy. Hers.

The fake Rin is walking out of a convenience store in Ikebukuro, holding a canned coffee and a pack of cigarettes.

Rin doesn't smoke.  
She hates coffee.

But the internet already believes it.  
The tags are bad. #rinwatanabe #idolfallfromgrace #smokingidol #trashyqueen

She sits on the edge of her futon, staring at the picture like it's a puzzle she should be able to solve if she just... turns her head right.

There's a taste in her mouth like aluminum.

By 10 a.m., the agency knows.  
By 10:15, her manager is calling.  
By 10:16, she's not answering.

She doesn't want his voice right now. Doesn't want to hear that fake-polite panic. Doesn't want the *""Rin-chan, please cooperate, this is bad for everyone""* routine.

She opens the curtains instead.  
Winter sun, thin and white like it's been washed too many times.  
Tokyo outside is a muted mess concrete, steam from vents, crows laughing at something only crows find funny.

She checks the photo again. Zooms in.  
The girl's smile small, almost private, like she's thinking of something only she knows. Rin hates it because she recognizes it. It's hers. That's *her* Stage 5 ending pose smile. How does someone steal that?

Her phone rings again.  
She answers this time.

""Where are you?""  
""Home.""  
""Stay there. Don't go outside. We're... we're handling it.""

*We're handling it.*  
Agency-speak for *We have no idea what's going on but we're going to yell at a few interns until it looks like we're working.*

At noon she caves and calls Kana.

Kana's voice is a low rush, the kind you get when you're talking in the back room where the boss can't hear.

""I swear to god, Rin, she looks exactly like you in person. I saw her yesterday at Shibuya crossing. Thought it was you until she looked me dead in the eye and walked away.""

""Could it be a fan?""  
""Maybe, but fans don't get jackets made by our costume department. That's yours, right?""

Rin doesn't answer.

Because here's the thing   
That jacket wasn't in her closet last week. She'd assumed laundry or dry cleaning or some staff mix-up. Happens all the time.

Except maybe this time it didn't ""happen.""

She tries to eat lunch. Fails. Miso soup goes cold on the table.

Instead she opens her laptop. She types her own name into the search bar like a masochist.  
Scrolling, scrolling. Tweets, threads, blurry paparazzi shots.

Someone's already made a ""Spot the Fake Rin"" compilation.  
Three photos two of her, one of the impostor. The comments argue like it's a game show.

She closes the laptop.

Her apartment feels wrong now.  
Like maybe she's the fake one.  
Like maybe the real Rin Watanabe is outside somewhere, wearing her clothes, holding her smile, walking in the January air like she owns it.

By 2 p.m., she gives up on staying inside.

Coat, scarf, sunglasses, mask. She could be anyone.  
She decides to be ""anyone.""

Ikebukuro first. She doesn't even know why. Maybe because the photo was there. Maybe because if she doesn't go, she'll feel like she's hiding.

The streets smell like fried chicken and exhaust. Kids in oversized coats, vending machines buzzing.

She stands outside the convenience store from the picture. Same bright orange sign, same crooked poster for oden by the door.

No fake Rin.

At 3:15, she's in a café, small enough that the steam from her tea fogs the window.

She wonders if the impostor is somewhere right now, drinking actual coffee and laughing about the chaos.  
She wonders if they look alike when they're both alone.

There's a weight in her pocket  her phone. A text from an unknown number:

Nice coat.

She looks up.

And there she is.  
Three tables over.

Same face.  
Same hair, even the same way the fringe doesn't sit right unless you tilt your head.  
But her eyes are different more amused, like she's been waiting for this moment.

The fake Rin raises her cup in a little toast.

Rin doesn't remember leaving the café.

She's walking fast, faster, past pachinko parlors and shuttered boutiques.  
Her breath is sharp in the cold.

The phone buzzes again:

Don't be mad. I'm just making you interesting.

She wants to throw the phone into the gutter. She doesn't.

Back home, it's dark already.  
The city outside is all lit windows and the hum of trains in the distance.

She sits on the floor, knees up, back against the wall.  
The jacket her jacket is on the chair where she left it weeks ago. She stares at it like it's guilty.

Because maybe it is.

The agency calls again.  
She lets it ring.

She's thinking about the other girl's smile.  
She's thinking about how for one second, looking at her, she couldn't tell if she was seeing herself in a mirror or someone else entirely.

And she's thinking  
If someone can wear your face better than you can...  
What does that make you?

Outside, somewhere in the city, the fake Rin is probably laughing.  
Probably wearing something she hasn't even noticed is missing yet.  
Probably planning the next picture.

January 12, 2015—  
Day off, supposedly.

Rin Watanabe closes her eyes.  
She's not sure if she's going to sleep or just wait.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

For context, if I buy one 65lb box from genuine origin, I'm locked in to that coffee/roast for at least 2 or 3 months before I sell out.

Before anyone comments, we should all by now understand the obvious - that as you roast towards and beyond 2nd crack, all coffees trend towards tasting the same, that customer preference can differ wildly from roaster preferences, the truly best beans for dark roast may be wasted on dark roast (value/taste), etc....

Here's my experience:

>\~Brazil - cup scores <84 - naturally earthy and robust - Myself and customers have preferred Brazil beans roasted to a strong medium (FC to FC+) or even a well developed light roast. Unless the greens are screened well, roasting at or beyond 2nd crack tastes essentially like any supermarket dark roast. Brazil beans may make for a good dark roast if they are the cheapest beans to obtain...?

>\~Indian Robusta - Kaapi Royale SCR 17 - cup scores <82 - I've roasted and sold 130lbs of this to dark roast lovers and they have been huge fans. I have never roasted it beyond 2nd crack, though this would be a great candidate for ""French/Vienna"" roasts. Beyond FC+ was undrinkable for me. FC to FC+ was preferred by customers, saying this coffee causes them to feel things they haven't felt in a while. I would consider this a robusta to routinely stock/purchase.

>\~Tanzania Organic Robusta - Roasting FC+ and drinking french press was delightful, the strongest and smoothest ""diner coffee"" I have ever had. This was not fine robusta, but probably the best dark roast I've ever done as far as how quickly sold to my customer base. I should have bought more as this was very popular marketed as ""espresso roast"". So far, this would be my first pick if I had to pick a coffee to routinely offer as a dark roast.

>\~Sumatra Mandheling G1 TP Wet-hulled - cup score 85.5 - This coffee is probably universally recognizable to anyone who is a fan of dark roast. After cupping FC+ roasts, I can roast it decent but I don't think I've ever roasted it well..? I don't like the taste at all but it to sells very well. I could definitely use some tips to roast this better if anyone has any, I use Coffee Crafters Valenta 3 fluid bed roaster.

I've brewed a few different deathwish coffees while visiting family and to be honest, they seem to be pretty good dark roasts to me. Online they say they blend Indian robusta and Peru coffees. This makes me very curious to try roasting some high grown Peru....

My intuition and coffee knowledge tell me that the best dark roasts are probably high grown african coffees or high grown super dense South American coffees... BUT, if one wants to make the most profit off of a good dark roast, the best route is probably less in demand African coffees or certain high grown South American.....? ...is the perfect dark roast an inexpensive honey/anaerobic that can stand up to FC+? This is what I'm curious to hear about from you other roasters. Thanks so much!",0,1758199790.0,roasting,0,0.5,False

Hindi ko alam bakit ang dami-dami niyong comments eh ang goal ko lang naman sampo.

Ang gusto ko lang naman madama, ‘yong sasabihan niyo ako ng, “It’s okay girl pwede pa ‘yan, i-push!” HAYUF!

Tawang-tawa kayo, literal na nag-eemote ako kagabi tapos bigla akong napapa-reverse walk while reading your comments. Mapapalakad ulit ako kapag may nag-comment ng bad, tapos reverse walk ulit kapag may shutangeners nagpapahaba ng mala Dora kong hair.

May nag-tell pa ng karma farming daw! How dare you! I did not even know how this karma work on Reddit as I’m new, and the goal is to share and to have the thoughts of some of mga perfect bongables na people here.

I thought kung gaano karami karma mo here, kakarmahin ka gano’n kadami in real life uhuhu hayuffffff! Paano i-share ang karma here guyssss ng maambunan kayong lahat!!!

Anyway, lumalayo tayo sa kwento. Heto na nga!

Jusmeyo Marimar! Kilig ko sobra, pakiramdam ko pati bangs ko hahaba sa kagagahan koooo!

So siya nag-deliver ng Hopia guys… ang kilig ng ate niyo to the level na hindi lang kaluluwa ko ang nag-twerk!

Hindi na ako natulog, as in! Kahit anong pilit ko na mag-beauty rest kasi dadalhin niya ang hopia kinabukasan, wala talaga. Sa sobrang dami kong naiisip at sa mga comments niyo na ring mala-gaga kayooo!!

Nandoon, naiisip ko sasabihin niya:

“Sorry S****, I have meeting early this morning but I told Erika to deliver instead..”

Like shutangeners, sino si Erika!?

Then I’ll reply, “It’s okay, but who is Erika?” Ayun kaba-kaba na ako sa sarili kong iniisip tapos magiging reply niya:

“My girlfriend..”

Edi ayon, mag-book na ako papuntang Thailand—Iceland na lang pala para damang-dama ko ang lamig, o kaya palitan ko na lang siya ng Afam there.. ‘di ba!!!

Lamang ang may plano!

Inabot na nga ako ng umagang walang tulog. Kasi kapag matulog pa ako, kahit anong gising sa akin, kahit mag-disco kayo sa harap ko, wala me pake.

Baka iwanan niya lang sa mga kasama ko sa bahay eh gusto ko pa naman magamit mga advice niyo sa aking mga hayuf kayo.

Pero appreciate ko mga advice niyo!

So nag-chat na nga siya, sobrang kilig ko mga ate ko, kulang na lang manginig tuhod ko and matatae ako na hindi.

SIYA ANG HAHATIDDDD!

Fast forward na kasi hahaba na ang typings ko kung idadamay ko pa mga ritual ko while waiting sa kanya.

May nag-doorbell na nga.

Syempre sobrang kaba ko! Saktong 150 lang dinala ko, hindi ko ni-follow ang sabi ng iba na 500 daw para masuklian niya para magtagal moment namin.

Okay lang naman, pero mga ate ko baka kasi ‘di ba natural lang na business tapos sabihin walang change.

Eh kilala ko sarili ko mga ate ko baka masabi ko pa:

“Keep the change, baby! Keep me too if you want..”

Char!

Pero okay lang naman, ang point ko lang naman is titignan ko if ano ba plano nito sa buhay, susunod ba sa yapak ni Henry Sy o kay Atong Ang!

Balik tayo sa nag-doorbell. Ate ko, ready na ako sobra! As in! Sobrang cute ko na, pwede na mahampas!

Nag-ready na ako ng sasabihin pagbukas ng gate:

“Hey! Good morning.”

In a very virgin way… I mean, sweet, ‘yong hindi makabasag pinggan, ‘yong mala-Maria Clara, ‘yong hindi naman niya malalaman na nagti-twerk kaluluwa ko.

Ayon na nga, binuksan ko na ang gate.

Pag-open ko, syempre sabi ko, “Hey! Good morning.”

Shutangeners mga ate koooooo!!!!!!!

Ngumiti si kuyang rider sabi:

“Sweet mo naman ma’am. Parcel mo po, bayad na ‘to.”

‘Yong ngiti ko parang papunta ng iyak teh, pero pinanindigan ko pa rin kasi kawawa naman si kuya rider, nagtatrabaho lang naman.

Pero sa true, hindi ko kasi napansin text ni kuya na rider from TikTok shop kakaisip ko, siya lang iniisip ko buong gabi hangang umaga….

After non, medyo na-badtrip ako kasi mag-10 na ate ko wala pa rin siya at ulo ko sasabog na.

Tinatamaan na ako ng antokkk! Kulang nalang lumutang o tumagos sa pader ang babae na ito!

So ayun, may nag-doorbell ulit.

Pero this time wala na practice-practice kasi tinamaan na talaga ako ng kaantukan. May pending pa ako na trabaho mga hayuf na ‘yan!

Pagbukas ko ng gate shutangeners!

Naka pang workout siyang Sando na White tapos kitang-kita braso niya—nabatak na batak sa gym!

POGI NIYA MGA ATE KO!

Syempre kahit nagsisigaw kaluluwa ko, kalmado pa rin. Ang galing ko sa part na ‘yan.

So hindi na ako nakapag-hey o good morning, siya na nauna magsalita.

Unang sabi mga ate ko:

“Sorry sa delay, may meeting ako kahapon sa Davao.”

Dapat kahapon pa daw, hindi na daw naihatid ng kasama nila sa house.

Napa-thanks Lord hindi nila hinatid hahahaha!

Ang ate niyong gaga, pabinibini sabi:

“No! It’s okay, walang problema, anytime naman pwede deliver.”

Tapos inabot niya ang box.

Shuta, buti hindi nanginig kamay ko kahit nginig na nginig na kaluluwa ko!

Inabot ko sa kanya ang 150, nong una akala ko kukunin niya pero hindi mga mare!

Sabi niya, joke lang daw ang 150 at hindi naman niya ibebenta pa, sinusubukan pa lang niya.

Dahil daw love ko ang Hopia, pa-try niya sa akin at ang bayad ko lang daw ay ang honest review ko kung ano sa palagay ko pwede pa ma-improve o ano ang kulang.

HAYUF MGA ATE KO! ANG SARAP!

Lumulundag-lundag kaluluwa ko, nasa isip ko:

“Mamaya ka sa akin, ipapaalam ko sa buong barangay kung gaano ka kasarap….”

Teh!?……. Char!

Pinipigilan ko na lang talaga hindi masapak ‘yong gate kasi baka ma-turn off siya…

Hindi rin nagtagal usapan namin kasi dumaan lang daw siya, deretso siya ng shop nila kasi may aasikasuhin.

Ako naman hindi talaga ako pumasok hanggang hindi siya nakaalis mga ate ko.

Nong wala na siya, tumakbo na ako papasok ng bahay, deretso ng kwarto saka ako sumigaw—pero sigaw na walang sounds…

Kaya niyo ‘yon? HAHAHAHA baka kasi umabot sigaw ko sa baba, magulat si papa, tataas blood pressure niya, edi mawalan pa ako ng ama ng di oras sa kagagahan ko…

So ayun nga shutangeners!

Kilig na kilig ako, sana kayo rin!!!

Sa nagsasabi ng karma farming, bleeehh! May hopia ako tapos may kilig, wala kayo! Inyo na karma ko.. char!


Ibig sabihin lang mga mare gumagalaw na ang baso, right?

Hayuf, pagalawin ko talaga mga magnitude 10.10!

Magcha-chat pa kami mga ate ko! Balak ko review na lang ‘to bukas noh? Para magtagal ang moment o kaya may advice kayo d’yan?

Hahahhahaha pero sa true sobrang kilig ko!!!!!

Sana hindi naman ako aasa sa feeling ko na ‘to. Hindi ko na gugustuhin ang hopia ulit!

Asado na lang na siopao ng 7/11! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA

Dito na lang mga mare! Ang haba na eh!

Pahampas na lang kung nabasa mo lahat HAHAHAHAHA.

Update ko na lang kayo kung ano magiging takbo ng kagagahan ko!!!


Saka! Parang awa niyo na mukhang wala siyang Reddit ‘wag na nawa ito mapadpad sa Facebook isusumpa talaga ‘yang magpopost niyan sa Facebook! ",38,1758199613.0,MayNagChat,58,0.98,False

Just holding them? No problem.   
  
But the moment you trade, swap, or even buy coffee with Bitcoin, it can become a taxable event.

**The basics:**

* Most governments treat crypto like property, not cash  
* Holding = no tax  
* Selling, swapping, mining, staking, or airdrops = taxable  

**Think of it this way:**   
  
💰 Mining or getting paid in BTC = regular income (like rent checks)   
📈 Selling or swapping coins = capital gains (like flipping real estate)   
⏳ Hold more than a year and you usually get cheaper rates, sell quicker and you’ll pay more.

So if you’re just HODLing, relax. But once you move your coins, make sure you keep records.

I wanted to share something that’s been working for me lately. It’s nothing life-changing, but it’s a nice little side hustle for coffee money, groceries, or even saving toward something fun.

I’ve been using **Swagbucks** for a few months now, and I’m honestly surprised how quickly the points (SB) add up. You can earn by:

* Answering short surveys (they take just a few minutes)
* Watching videos or ads in the background
* Shopping online through their portal (you get cashback in SB)
* Even playing games or searching the web

It’s definitely not a full-time income, but it’s great for squeezing out a few bucks during downtime.

👉 If you sign up through [this link](https://swagbucks.7eer.net/c/4414972/19503/799), there’s a **bonus for new users** (currently $10 when you hit your first earnings goal). Basically, you’re rewarded just for giving it a try.

For me, it’s been like: do a couple of surveys during lunch, run a few videos while I’m cooking, and before I know it, I’ve earned enough for a small gift card. Last month I cashed out for an Amazon card and treated myself guilt-free.

1nk6xxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1nk6xxs/40_mrr_hit_different_than_expected_felt_both/,40 MRR hit different than expected - felt both amazing and crushing. Here's my marketing roadmap to $1K (and why customer acquisition is humbling,"**The $40 MRR moment:** 8 months building solo, finally hit $40 MRR last month with 2 paying users. I thought I'd be celebrating, but honestly? It felt weird. Amazing because ""holy shit, strangers are paying for something I built"" but also crushing because... it's $40. I spend more on coffee.

**The marketing reality check:** I built a solid product (AI job application analysis), got great user feedback, and assumed marketing would be the easy part. Wrong. So wrong.

**What's NOT working in customer acquisition:**

* **Reddit organic posts:** Great for feedback, terrible for actual signups
* **Cold outreach:** 200+ LinkedIn messages, 3% response rate, 0 conversions
* **Twitter:** Posting into the algorithm abyss with 47 followers

**What's barely working:**

* **Word of mouth:** Those 2 paying users came from  Reddit comments (shoutout to tydal if you are out there )
* **Content marketing:** One detailed post got 500+ views.
* **Direct engagement:** Commenting on job search threads, mentioning the tool when relevant

**The $1K roadmap (need your input):**

**Phase 1: Double down on what's working**

* More strategic Reddit engagement (r/jobs, r/resumes, r/careeradvice)
* Content marketing focused on job search pain points
* Friend referral program (seems obvious now)

**Phase 2: Paid validation**

* Facebook/LinkedIn ads to job seekers ($500 test budget)
* Reddit promoted posts in job search subreddits
* Google Ads for ""job search tools"" keywords

**Phase 3: Partnership plays**

* Career coach partnerships (they could use this for clients)
* University career centers (students are broke but high volume)
* Professional networking groups

**The pricing dilemma:** Current pricing: $20-$85/month. Job seekers are price-sensitive, but the value is huge (users report 3x more interviews). Should I:

* Lower pricing to increase volume?
* Add a one-time purchase option?
* Focus on higher-value segments (career coaches, recruiters)?

**Questions for the community:**

1. **Customer acquisition:** How did you crack your first $1K MRR? What channels actually worked vs. what you thought would work?
2. **Messaging:** I keep saying ""AI job analysis"" but maybe the hook should be ""triple your interview rate""?
3. **Market positioning:** Job seekers vs. career professionals vs. B2B (HR teams). Where would you focus first?
4. **Content strategy:** Should I document this $40→$1K journey publicly or focus on job search educational content?

**The honest struggle:** Building the product was fun. Marketing feels like shouting into the void while burning money on ads that don't convert. Every SaaS marketing blog makes it sound systematic, but it feels more like throwing spaghetti at the wall.

**What I need:** 47 more paying users at $20/month to hit $1K MRR. Sounds simple. Feels impossible.

Would love to hear from founders who've been through this specific growth stage - what actually moved the needle vs. what felt productive but didn't matter?

Also open to brutal feedback on positioning, pricing, or marketing approach. At $40 MRR, I can afford to pivot before I get too attached to strategies that aren't working.

**Current metrics for context:**

* 2 paying users ($40 MRR)
* Product is solid (great feedback, low churn)
* Marketing is clearly the bottleneck

1nk6xhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1nk6xhv/door_to_door_exterminator_now_i_have_bugs/,"Door to door exterminator, now I have bugs. Conspiracy theory:","I get door to door exterminator salesmen coming to my door at least once a month. I have no problem declining their services. I respect the hustle of sales, but everything about these services seem like a red flag. I’ve had friends who have signed up and then had terrible experiences with the exterminators charging them repeatedly without providing services.

For context, I live in a townhouse.

Interestingly, I’ve never had an issue with bugs or pests in my house. I keep the house incredibly clean and spray pest prevention chemicals from time to time around my house. However, the last two times an exterminator salesman showed up, miraculously, I had bugs the next day or so.

Last month a salesman came, he didn’t have a business card on him which is a red flag anyway, then he told me all the neighbors are having an ant problem. Lo and behold the next day my neighbor and I have an ant infestation.

Yesterday a salesman came, we denied their services, and today I had the biggest roach I’ve ever seen in my life in my house. 

So it’s probably coincidence, but the conspiracy theorist in me thinks that these exterminator salesmen are creating a problem (planting bugs) and selling a solution (their sketchy exterminator services).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nk6owz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nk6owz/my_best_friend_and_i_just_killed_each_other/,My best friend and I just killed each other.,"Now that I'm trying to tell the story of how I died, I've found myself appreciating the craft of eulogy more than I ever did in life. I'm finding it difficult to find where the story of my end begins.

It all started with *it*, I suppose. I saw it first on my walk home from work a month ago. I'd stayed late at the coffee shop after my shift was technically over, and that shift had itself only begun after a long day at school, so I wasn't in the best of moods. What helped distract from the foulness of my mood was that me and my buddy, Rick, worked similar hours as part-timers in the city who could only work outside of school hours, and we worked close enough together that we'd meet up after work and head back home together; we lived in the same neighborhood, so at least we had some company in the dark, silent city late at night.

I forgot all about the woes of university life, though, when I saw it. I caught it in the corner of my eye at first, two pale eyes peering out from the darkness of an alley into the street as we walked toward the train station long after the buses had stopped running for the night.

What I thought it was at first, I don't know, but I remember not thinking much of it at the time. A homeless person looking for some spare change, maybe. I didn't say anything to Rick, whose eyes were, as per usual, glued to his phone. I didn't say anything when I saw those two pale eyes, all white with no iris or pupil if my mind wasn't playing tricks on me, set into the bald, papery white skull of the figure that I spotted in the reflection of a store window following not too far behind us a few minutes later. I didn't take it seriously. If I had, perhaps none of this would have happened. If anything, I thought it was annoying; if I was going to get robbed or attacked by a homeless guy, he couldn't have found me at a worse time.

In hindsight, I should have known something was up. Despite its emaciated appearance, it moved in a way that suggested strength and power, with an even stride that made him look as though he was floating and not walking. It was dressed in shades of black, which somewhat hid the disheveled state of its clothes, as it did look very much like a person who slept on the streets, despite the fact that it wasn't wearing very many layers. Even the long coat it wore was thin and couldn't have provided much heat, though the thing never shivered in the cold the entire time my eyes were on it. Rick and I were dressed for the cold and were trembling before we'd walked a block.

It was on the train, too. I knew at once when Rick saw it, because his face went red as he tried not to laugh. Despite my annoyance with that habit of his — unfortunate-looking people were one of the funniest things in the world, if you asked Rick — I had my own bad habit of laughing when others did, even when it wasn't appropriate. Soon we were both consumed by a fit of laughter that was only silent through our efforts to not break the silence that blanketed the world at such a late hour with our nonsense. It didn't seem to mind. It just stared out at the world passing by out the window. I only realized later, after things outside of my ability to stop had already begun, that it had never cast a reflection onto the window no matter how the light shifted.

When we got off the train, it was time for Rick and I to part ways, and we did so without much fanfare. We'd see each other at school tomorrow. What I thought was a random stranger who'd just happened to catch the same train as us didn't get off at our station, so I put him out of my mind. Just one of those people you meet when you're out late at night. No one of note.

The problems started when I got to the train station two days later — Rick sometimes had days off when I didn't, lucky bastard — and Rick wasn't there. I texted him to ask whether or not he was going to be late, but he didn't answer. He didn't even read my text, according to my phone. I shrugged it off and went about my day as normal. When I had some free time around noon and saw that Rick still hadn't read my text, I started getting a little bit annoyed at how off I felt without him at my side throughout the day. We took all the same classes, so we were rarely apart; our childish pipe dream was to study game design, which we did, and then open a studio out of the unused garage at my parents' house when we graduated. That had been the goal since we were twelve. I found myself feeling kind of embarrassed by how codependent I must have gotten without even noticing.

I had work again that night, so I couldn't keep checking my phone like I had been throughout the day, but I got the feeling that if I had, I would have continued to see that read receipt showing that he hadn't even seen my message. Instead of being worried, I thought, what a loser! Skipping school wasn't going to get us our studio. The next morning, which I had to myself, I walked to his house a few streets over from mine, the way it had been for near-exactly a decade, and knocked on the door intending to give Rick a piece of my mind. Instead, his mother answered the door, and I swallowed the harsh words that had been on the tip of my tongue in favor of a smile.

""Hey, honey,"" Nancy said quietly, almost whispering. Her voice had the same tight quality as her face. ""Ricky's not well right now, so he might not be up to going out, if that's why you've come.""

That made no sense. If he was just sick, then why the hell had he not answered my texts? ""What's he sick with? Can I talk to him, at least?""

Nancy hesitated before saying, ""Sure, why not?"" The way she said it made me think she was holding something back. I didn't fail to note that even as she walked me to his room — I had no clue why she felt the need to do that, considering that I'd been in their home a thousand times before — and I asked again, she didn't tell me exactly how he was sick.

At this time, I hadn't seen Rick in three days. I don't think I had gone that long without seeing him since we were fifteen. When I stepped into his room and Nancy closed the door behind me, I'll admit that I cringed at the sight of him. His room was dark, his curtains drawn so that no sunlight could fill the room from outside. It took my eyes a moment to adjust, but when I did, I almost gasped. Rick was a small bundle of pale flesh wrapped in thick, dark blankets on his bed, buried in them. His skin was so white that his veins were visible all over, and he shone with slick sweat. If he wore anything under the blanket, I thankfully couldn't see what. He was not quite gaunt, but he was visibly thinner than he'd been when I last saw him. His eyes were dark still, as was his hair, though his usually bouncy curls were matted to his scalp from the sweat.

I almost blurted out that he looked like shit, which I realized before even opening my mouth wouldn't do any good. That's when the smell hit me, the stench of Rick's sweat-soaked body and the musk of unwashed flesh. His room's window must have been closed, and it must have been closed for a while. I made a noise of shock and disgust, and Rick's face twisted into a wry grin.

""Sorry,"" he said in a dull voice that shared none of the humor in his eyes.

""No problem,"" I said, making an effort not to pinch my nose so I could stop smelling him. ""What's going on, man? Haven't heard from you in a few days. Your mom told me you're sick.""

""Yeah. Sick,"" he mumbled, shifting stiffly under the blankets that he brought up to his neck with shaking arms. ""Don't know with what, but it's bad.""

I nodded slowly, and tried not to breathe in too hard. ""Have you seen a doctor?""

Rick scoffed. ""No. Dad thinks it's just the common cold. Won't hear anything about a doctor."" He laughed, and it carried a sickly wheeze. ""A doctor would have to come to me, anyway. Can't walk. Can barely move my arms. My body feels tight. And cold. Really cold.""

I shuffled on my feet, not knowing what to do to help my best friend feel better. ""Some sun can't hurt. I'll open the curtains.""

Rick sat up so fast that he almost lurched forward. ""No!"" he roared, his voice filled with something that might have been fear or rage. His eyes met mine and I was frozen to the spot by the intensity of his gaze. There was a dark patch where his head had rested on his pillow.

A few moments passed before I gathered enough of my wits to recover. ""Okay."" The smell of Rick's unwashed body, the sharp smell of sweat, filled my nose even more strongly than it had when I was standing at the door. It was a proof of my willpower that I didn't gag. My voice was strained, though, when I repeated myself without anything more to say. ""Okay.""

Rick's eyes filled with pain and he groaned as he laid back down in bed slowly. His movements were jerky and stiff, as if moving was not only painful, but difficult, as if all strength had left his body, or as if his limbs had locked up and relaxing was the hard part. He was left panting afterwards, and my first instinct was to move closer and help him however I could, but the thought crossed my mind that whatever he had might have been contagious, and that kept me where I was, one step from the door.

""Em,"" he said with his strangled, breathless voice. ""You probably shouldn't hang around.""

""Yeah, probably,"" I sighed. I looked around the dark room and instantly regretted breathing deeply enough to sigh. ""Have you talked to our teachers? I won't do your homework for you, but I can set something up.""

""Yeah, that'd be great."" His eyes met mine, and even as his body sagged into his bed after his brief exertion, those dark eyes were burning.

I left after that — the smell drove me out just as much as Rick's insistence that he was fine. The whole way home, I took breathed deeply to get the stench out of my nostrils, despite how it burned my nose and lungs. That wasn't the only reason I took my time. I tried to figure out what the hell kind of disease makes a person that kind of sick. I went to our local park and sat while I searched the internet, but I found nothing. Not a single thing matched that he could have possibly caught from anywhere or anyone. It's like his body had just decided to shut down out of nowhere. It bugged me, but there was nothing to do except wait for Rick to get better.

The week that followed was hard. I wouldn't claim that I had it harder than Rick, but I struggled. If three days on my own had made me so thoroughly uncomfortable after a decade of inseparability from my best friend, then I wasn't looking forward to spending what eventually became weeks that way. I had work and school, so I couldn't visit Rick often, which only added to my loneliness. He never read any of my texts, much less answer them. We called a few times, but those calls always left me feeling hollow inside. His voice was a poor replacement for his friendship. I had never been the type to wear earrings, but I started wearing the studs he'd gotten me for my eighteenth birthday a couple of years back — they were pure silver, and gleamed even when there wasn't much light. It's just a shame that I can't wear them now.

What really bothered me at the time was that Rick wasn't getting better. Whatever he'd caught, it was *not* a common cold, whatever Rick's dad said. The guy was a neat freak who my mom — who had a degree in psychology that proved its worth every day while she worked as a lifeguard at the pool — liked to joke with about the OCD diagnosis she knew he'd get if he saw a professional, which he refused to; any kind of illness of the mind or body set him off. It was why he was sleeping in the car while his son worked through this sickness.

About two weeks into my new status quo, I encountered him again. Or, rather, *it*. It had filled out a little in the time since I'd seen it last, and it moved with even more strength and liquid agility than it had had before. It moved like a shadow upon the ground, gliding more than stepping. The Shadow had not emerged from an alley this time, it hadn't stepped out from the darkness. One second, I had been alone on the streets of the city while making my way home in the middle of the night, and the next, the Shadow was there. I made an abrupt left turn as soon as I could without missing a step, not looking where I was going. I had no destination in mind. All I wanted was to not be alone with it.

I glanced back a few steps past the turn and found the Shadow gliding around the corner. It was much closer than it had been mere seconds ago when I had taken my eyes off of it, and that caused my heart to leap up into my throat. I stifled a gasp and picked up my pace a little, because I suddenly got a much better look than I ever had before. My eyes had met the Shadow's, empty and whiter even than its papery skin, which was not as tight around its skull and throat than it had been last time, which I noticed at the same time as the faint pale shine of bone jutting out from between its lips. Bone. No, not bone. Teeth. Prickly dread flashed through me like ice in my veins, and I came to another realization; the Shadow wasn't gaining on me, wasn't catching up — it was keeping pace with me.

That was when I realized the Shadow was dangerous. I had been so at ease, so comfortable in my life, that even when a danger had entered my life the first time I spotted the Shadow following us, I had ignored it and carried on with my night. The next turn I made was another left, taken at the nearest available opportunity. As soon as I rounded the corner I started sprinting down the street and looked for any small space that I could tuck myself into so that I could hide. Unfortunately, there were none. I cursed my luck and begged my aching legs to move faster, but I'd just gotten off a longer shift than usual and was just about dead on my feet.

When I glanced back to see whether or not the Shadow was following me, my heart skipped a beat. It wasn't behind me. While my back was still turned away from the direction in which I was running — which was back the way I had originally been walking after leaving work after making two left turns — I stumbled backwards into what felt like a brick wall. I bounced on impact and fell forward onto my hands and knees. The back of my head I had struck his exposed chest — his clothes were in an even worse state than ever — burned the way that touching cold metal burns. Looking back, I was met with the towering figure of the Shadow. It had never been close enough to me before for me to properly gauge its height, but it had to be six and a half feet tall. As I scrambled to my feet and backed away from it as it looked down at me with pale, white eyes that almost glowed in the moonlight, I realized another thing.

The Shadow couldn't be human. It had crossed a hundred feet in a second without a sound. The damned thing didn't even look like it breathed, that's how perfectly still it was when it wasn't moving, so I didn't think it had ever risked becoming out of breath through such a physical feat. It could have caught me at any time. Even aside from that, running into it at full speed had felt like crashing into the ground! It hadn't budged an inch. Whoever this person was, if it was a person, was no mere man. Panic flashed through me like a lightning bolt and I turned to run, panting hard as I pushed my body to the limit in a snap decision that hadn't really been much of a choice at all. I was in the hands of my fight or flight response then, and my body chose to flee.

I ran right across the road without checking if it was safe to cross, and almost got pulverized by a car that narrowly missed me by three feet or less. The headlights blinded me for a second, but when I fell on my ass in the middle of the road and stared back the way I'd come and blinked spots out of my eyes, I saw clearly that the Shadow's head turned to follow the car that had nearly killed me slide to a stop halfway through the intersection. It turned back to me and my skin prickled with the heavy anticipation of death as my eyes met its own. The driver, whose hands shook in trembling fists, approached me from where he left his car door hanging open and asked me if I was alright. I glanced at him and told him that I was alright, but when I looked back at where the Shadow had been, almost taunting me with its casual demeanor, it was gone. Only the dark of the night remained where it had stood.

I got a cab home from right there on the street, from the spot that I refused to move from without some form of protection from the Shadow.

The guy who'd almost hit me with his car must have felt really guilty for almost killing some random girl out of nowhere, because he stayed with me the whole time and seemed curious and worried about what a young woman was doing running through the city with such recklessness that she'd almost get herself hit by a moving vehicle. I told him that I had a stalker, and figured it was close enough to the truth that I could get some protection before my cab got there. The Shadow had only left after another person had shown up. Was it scared of getting caught? Somehow I thought it was something else.

When I got home, I didn't mention what happened to my parents right away. In the morning, I only told them what I had told the man who'd stayed with me after the Shadow had disappeared. I had a stalker, and I didn't particularly want to be leaving the house knowing that some creep was out there waiting for me to be alone so it could do whatever the hell it wanted to me. I had no idea what the Shadow might have even wanted from me, since its non-humanity was certain in my mind by then, but my parents certainly had a hunch.

I was thus glad to receive what they called a 'benevolent grounding', happy to be stuck in the house while my parents had me call the police and give them a statement when they showed up shortly after. They said they'd keep in contact if they found the Shadow using my description of him as a guide. I didn't mention its eyes, or its overwhelming physical abilities. I got the feeling that they'd laugh at me if I told them that the man stalking me had purely white eyes that shone in the moonlight and could move faster than I suspected any human could. I didn't know exactly what the Shadow was, but I wanted to find out. My first idea for getting information also happened to be the one person that I wanted to see more than anything at that time.

It took a few days to convince them that nothing bad would happen if I went over to Rick's, though the only thing that got them to agree to it was my acceptance of a bodyguard; my father, who liked to think he was tough because he used to be military, but only had a medal and a limp to show for it. Another of his demands was that he got to finally crack open the safe he hid under their bed and carry the gun he kept in there the whole time we were out of the house. In those few days, I didn't go to school or work. I had my homework delivered by trusted friends, and I got all my shifts at the coffee shop covered for the foreseeable future. A deep cringing shame overwhelmed me the entire time that my dad and I walked the empty suburban streets. Despite that, I was just as anxious as he was, looking over my shoulder and walking quickly. We made it to Rick's place in record time after setting out just as the sun was dipping below the horizon, so that we'd be home in time for dinner.

Nancy answered the door again, and in the second before her whole face changed when she realized who was at her door, I saw clear as day the despair that had made her expression stony and dark. She let them in without a word, and hugged both of us so tight that I thought she might've become so depressed that she'd flipped and become manic and decided to strangle me. When I was free from her iron grip, I excused myself to talk to Rick and started down the hallway. That was, until Nancy called out with a shaky voice and her mania seemed to break, leaving her to plummet back to depression in an instant.

""Wait!"" she cried before realizing she'd yelled and taking a deep breath that seemed to soothe her. ""Ricky's not well, honey. I mean, you knew that, but … I don't think he's in the mood for visitors.""

It took me a moment to recover from the feeling of being slapped in the face. ""Why not?""

""He …"" Nancy struggled with the words. Her legs started shaking, and my dad guided her over to the sofa in their living room where they both sat. When she could collect herself, Nancy explained. ""I don't quite know how to say this."" She laughed, but it was a hollow sound. ""Emily, could you please sit?""

""No,"" I said roughly, fighting the tears that wanted to form in my eyes. I'd never liked getting emotional. When Rick and I had first met, he'd been one of my few classmates back then to not make fun of me for being an overly emotional *girl*. ""What's wrong with him? Why can't he tell me himself?""

Nancy's breath came in shaky huffs of air as she too began to tear up. My parents had always joked that they, both of them being fairly stoic people, had never taught her that little habit of getting worked up easily, and instead I'd learned it from Nancy, since I was over at her house so often. ""He's sleeping right now, but he's become … *particular* … in his taste in company."" When I stared at her in a silent demand for more, she averted her eyes from mine and stared at the carpet underneath her feet. ""When we got the doctor down here to look at him, something happened to Ricky. He got mad, or maybe scared, and acted out until the poor man left without figuring out what was wrong with him. Every doctor since then has gone through that same thing. He just lashes out. He's stronger than he looks, too — especially now — so when he gets violent …"" She paled at even the memory.

Only one thought came to me at that moment. *What in the world?* ""That's insane. Do you need to get the cops down here or what?"" I asked. My turbulent emotions had died down and I had become strangely calm; the shock of hearing all that had driven the sadness away and replaced it with sheer disbelief. The Rick I'd known hadn't been violent. Mostly because he'd never had the muscle mass to be really dangerous. As that thought crossed my mind, I made a connection, though I really, really didn't want it to be true. My suspicion was a crazy thing to just pitch to two rational, normal people, though, so I took a moment to decide on what I wanted to do about it.

I ended up deciding to just walk away from Nancy and my dad and march down the hallway toward Rick's room. I had to see for myself. At that moment, I didn't particular care if whatever he had was contagious or not. His door was already off its hinges when I arrived, and I stood staring at it for a moment before the smell hit me for the second time, all the way out in the hall. It was worse this time. The same odor of sweat and Rick's unwashed body hung in the air, worsened with time, but there was a metallic undercurrent to it this time, the bitter stench of iron that warned me of what I would find in there before I even stepped inside. Within the bedroom it was entirely dark, the curtains drawn and the window closed, and this time I did gag when I got far enough in that sweat and bodily fluids and blood was all that I sensed, so foul and rancid that my knees weakened and I had to stop to recover my balance. I turned his overhead light on and bathed the room in yellowish light that illuminated the scene that will stick in my memory forever.

Rick wasn't anywhere to be seen. A slurry that was more solid than liquid stained the carpet, red and yellow mixed into orange bile that steamed heavily and filled the room with its sickening aroma. The room was cold, so cold that my breath misted in front of my face. His window must have been opened finally, but it did nothing for the smell. There was rotten meat somewhere judging by the stench, and the buzzing of flies that I couldn't see, and I held my breath as I pushed further into the room to find it. A sound that could not have been made by a person made me jump as it echoed slightly from the bathroom attached to Rick's bedroom. The door was closed, and I was hesitant to destroy the memory of first coming to this house and marveling at how Rick had his own private bathroom when I didn't at home, but I walked over and gripped the doorknob tightly as it stung my hand from the cold, just like the Shadow's skin. That reminder pushed me to action even faster.

The smell of rotten meat and blood were only made worse by opening the door. There Rick was, hunched over his toilet and retching, making that awful, ear-splitting noise that had made my whole body erupt with goosebumps. When I screamed, his whole body turned toward me so fast that a cracking sound came from his neck or back, I don't know which. Red stained his lips and chin, and ran down his neck to soak his chest, which was just as bare as the last time we'd seen each other. He suddenly lurched again, and turned back to vomit up a gush of thick, dark blood that dripped from his tongue and lips slowly, as if partially congealed. He breathed wetly, his gasps causing him to choke on more of that thick, chunky blood that must have still been caught in his throat. Another heaving retch later, and something solid fell into the bowl beneath him, which made my blood run just as cold as his must be — what he threw up didn't steam at all.

""Em,"" his rasping, flat voice said. He spoke as if it hurt to speak. His eyes caught mine, and I screamed again, but not because of the fresh blood that dripped down his stained face and chest, which was just as dark and clotted as the old blood. I screamed because when I met his eyes, what I saw was not his usual blue pair of bright, happy eyes.

Rick's eyes were white, paler than pale, empty.

""Emily?"" he asked again, slowly standing with a motion so smooth that you would never be able to tell that he had been literally puking his guts up just a second earlier. He moved with a boneless sort of agility, another trait he now shared with the Shadow. ""You finally came. We've been waiting for you."" He did not smile, but amusement of a sort played across his bloody features.

*We.* A thrill of fear shot through me, and I moved on pure instinct, taking off out the door to Rick's room and leaping over the unhinged door. My dad was right there when I fled from the bedroom, peering into the room and blocking my way. I crashed into him and we both went staggering down the hallway, but while my mind was consumed with thoughts and fears of the Shadow and what Rick's resemblance of him might have meant, it was a comfort to know that others around me were not like them. My dad put himself in front of me instantly, and he didn't flinch when Rick's white body emerged from the empty doorframe with an almost slithering grace. Rick's light, bouncing steps brought him a few feet away from my dad and I, and we kept stumbling backwards as he approached slowly with a grim focus on his face.

""Hello, sir,"" Rick said, and he almost sounded like himself, but there was still a breathless rasp to his voice that marked him as different. ""You mind if we talk to Emily alone for a bit? We have a lot to catch her up on.""

""Jesus Christ, kid!"" my dad yelled, putting his hand out in front of him so that there was something between him and Rick. ""You ought to see a doctor.""

""No more doctors!"" Rick roared as he surged forward with serpentine agility. He lurched and tackled my dad, who was still built like a brick wall even ten years after being forced into an early retirement due to the bullet a crazy squad-mate of his had put in his leg in a fit of psychosis, or so they said. They fell to the floor, Rick crouching over my dad's fallen body, and pushed me down the hallway in the process so that I spilled out onto the floor in view of Nancy, who stood and shook like a leaf at the sight of her boy.

As I stood and put as much distance between Rick and myself, dragging Nancy along with me as I backed up against the front door, a window caught my attention at the corner of my eye. I didn't yet know the significance of why the Shadow had only ever appeared at night, but I remembered that Rick had sounded almost scared of the sun when I'd seen him last, so I figured the kind of thing they were — because they sure as hell weren't human — didn't just prefer the darkness, but actively avoided the light. As soon as half a plan formed in my head, though, I noticed that all that remained of the sunlight had faded to a dull orange halo around the horizon as the sun had just minutes ago set for good.

""Don't you see us?"" Rick said flatly, walking with a posture that showed off how thin he had really become since I'd seen him last. His bones showed through his thin, tight skin, and his shorts hung off him so loosely that they might have fallen off at any moment with some bad luck. His stomach was entirely concave, empty of innards that he had purged in the bathroom mere moments ago. Rick's chest did not rise and fall with the rhythm of breath. He held his arms out and smiled — his skin was pulled so taught against his ribs that I expected them to pierce through — but his eyes were still that same flat, pale white, empty of the humor that had filled his home, his life, just weeks ago. ""No more pain. No more doctors. We will never need a doctor again.""

Rick turned his back on Nancy and I quickly, and looked back at my dad, who'd forced himself to his knees; getting to his feet from the ground was a thing of the past. His gun, sleek and black, pointed right at Rick's chest, and even though his whole body shook, his hands were still. ""Stand down, son. We can help you, alright? You just need to stand down.""

When Rick moved faster than I'd ever seen a person move before, my dad opened fire. It didn't even look like Rick took any steps, he simply appeared behind my dad as if he hadn't bothered with the distance between them at all. My dad fired three rounds. One impacted the window with the loud sound of shattering glass. Another flew right by my head with a whizzing noise that I didn't process until I realized my face had suddenly became very wet with the red stench of metallic blood, and Nancy collapsed back onto the door behind us with a gasp that turned into a hacking cough as her lungs filled with blood. The third came when my dad must have felt Rick's hands on the back of his head and aimed his gun so that the bullet sailed right through Rick's neck through to the crown of his skull.

Fresh, dark red soaked Rick's entire front and splattered on the wall and ceiling behind him and above. A lot of that red coated my dad's head and shoulders and back. He tried to move away from Rick, to free himself from the grip that only tightened upon getting shot, but those hands were iron and he couldn't pry them off of the sides of his head, untangled those fingers from his shoulder-length hair. Rick's face, which was only intact due to the angle at which the bullet had blown through his brain, contorted in rage and sadness.

""Know this, Frank,"" Rick whispered, his words causing congealed blood to ooze out of his neck wound even faster. ""We regret spilling blood without feeding. We only want to talk. You did this to yourselves.""

Rick's hands moved as though he experienced no resistance from my dad's spine and neck muscles. He twisted my father's head around so quickly and effortlessly that he must have died before his body even jerked and fell to the ground, his chest slumped into the carpet and his lifeless eyes looking up at Rick as the remnant of breath caught in his twisted throat. I screamed again and looked between my dad, dead or dying on the ground with his neck broken, Nancy, bleeding out and shaking as she drowned in her own blood that was quickly soaking into the welcome mat under my feet, and Rick, who seemed no worse for wear after having his brains blasted out of his skull and throwing up all his insides. He was well and truly empty inside, just like those pale eyes that regarded me without emotion as he once again slowly approached with his almost feline gait.

""What are you?"" I screamed as tears streaked down my face. I had come here hoping for answers, but had only gotten blood, and more questions to boot. Trembling where I stood backed up against the front door to Rick's home, I finally broke. ""Stop it! Please, Rick!""

That gave him pause. His dark, thick blood, the blood of a man long dead, flooded down his legs and began sinking into the carpet as he stopped in his approach. ""We *are* Rick."" He said it like he didn't even really know. ""We remember *being* Rick.""

""Do you …"" I hesitated to ask, now that I had a shot. My body refused to stop shaking, which didn't help. ""Do you remember how you became … *us*?""

His empty eyes could have been looking at me or past me for all I knew. ""When we were Rick, we were walking in the night. Night is dangerous, the night hides many things best left unseen and unsaid."" Watching a person talk without having to stop to breathe was uncanny; it gave him a bizarre speaking rhythm, almost like he was trying to force as many words out as quickly as he could, but he never ran out of time. ""A shadow passing in the night. The other us. The one we were before we *were* us.""

""The Shadow,"" I stammered. It was the first time I had said it out loud. ""He came after me again the other day. Did you know that?""

Rick was silent for a moment before speaking again, almost like he was thinking, though I don't know how that was possible with his brain painting the walls of the home we had both loved once. ""No. The other us knows things that the other us does not share. That comes with being the first us.""

""The other you tried to kill me!"" I shouted. The more I learned, the more I saw, the more my fear transformed into rage. ""You're supposed to be my friend!""

""We are your friend, Emily,"" Rick said with an imitation of a smile. ""We would like to keep being friends if possible. That is why we have an offer for you.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""You want me to be like you?""

""Yes. We remember being Rick. We know that we were fond of you, and you of us. If we were *all* us, we could be together. Forever,"" Rick said, holding out his blood-covered hand to me and putting on that fake, empty smile. That smile exposed the pointed ends of teeth that had become sharper than knives.

Clarity filled my mind like a light bulb being switched on. Rick was gone, and this thing wearing his face might have remembered being him, but it clearly didn't remember well enough. Rick and I had been best friends, sure, and received more than our fair share of teasing given that we had been a boy and girl going through the growing pains of puberty together, but our relationship had never been the way everyone thought. We'd been friends to the end. The only feeling I had left for this hollow mimicry of my best friend was regret that I hadn't been with Rick when the end had come sometime in the last two weeks. What stood before me was the Shadow, talking through his mouth, seeing through his pale eyes, making him dance on invisible strings.

I tried to turn and open the door at my back, but the instant my back was to him, Rick's hands, colder than ice, took me by the shoulders and stopped me in my tracks. ""You will see. When you are us, you will see as we do."" The air around my neck grew colder as his head tilted as if to kiss the soft flesh of my throat, and it was at this moment that I realized what Rick had truly become.

""No!"" I screamed, but I had no power to resist his inhumanly strong grip.

His teeth punctured my skin with ease, many sharpened points slicing through my flesh like a hot knife through butter, except they were cold, as cold as his skin. My neck and shoulders were flooded with an indescribable cold that seeped through my muscles right down to the bone as his lips closed over the wounds, and he began to drink up the bright red blood that I could feel his freezing, slimy tongue seeking as it lapped against my warm skin. I writhed against him, trying to pull my head and neck away from his, and to my surprise, it worked. He screamed and lurched away from me so fast and hard that his feet left the ground and he tumbled over the sofa, collapsing on the floor in a boneless heap.

When he rose to his feet again, Rick flesh was smoking and melting away from the bone, the skin around that spot on his cheek was blackened and charred. I stared at him like an idiot before realizing what must have happened and taking the silver earrings out of my ears and clenching my fist around them. I resigned myself to what I had to do. Friends to the end.

When he leapt at me again with his mouth open and wet with my blood — I didn't even feel the burn of being bitten; it must have been that numbing cold — I let him tackle me to the floor between our dead parents and when the angle was right, I shoved the earrings into his mouth and used the bullet hole in his neck as a handhold to force his mouth shut, even though it didn't really work. He screamed, and smoke and dark, thick blood spilled from his lips and made me splutter and cough. He rolled onto his back and clawed at his mouth, but he couldn't seem to spit it out. When he screamed again, with another waft of black smoke, I got a glimpse of the earrings melted into the roof of his mouth. The smell of cooking flesh filled the air as he thrashed around and smoke began to pour from that neck wound, and the back of his ruined head, and his nose.

Rick went limp after a while of struggling, though the burning continued. Whatever had been keeping him alive must not have been able to fight off the silver, and soon his head was a flaming ball of charred meat. Sometime after the fire had consumed his head but before it spread to his body, I felt something akin to a string snapping, a connection that ran from me to him breaking. I also felt that same thing to something outside. That was a mere moment before the door rattled, something heavy and powerful pounding against it as if intended to knock it right off its hinges. I had no doubt that it could. I went to the door on weak legs and prayed that my suspicion about what Rick was had been correct before opening the door.

The Shadow towered over me in silence, and did not attack. He stood a few steps out from the threshold of the house, and peered in with those empty eyes that had likely seen more than anyone could in one lifetime. ""I see that my thrall has met death after all."" It spoke as if it didn't even truly care about that. ""Very well.""

""So that's it?"" I asked, a little bit breathless as I recovered from the of hearing the Shadow actually talk.

""What is done is done,"" it said, its deep voice filling the silent night outside.

""Am I going to turn into a vampire now, or what?"" I said shrilly as I gestured to the wound on my neck. The Shadow regarded me for a moment with its empty eyes and then turned to leave. ""Answer me!"" I didn't dare go outside and meet it on its turf, and watched as the Shadow melted into a shadow behind Rick's dad's car and vanish. Rick's dad was asleep in the car, his limp body slumped against the steering wheel. I hoped he was asleep.

That was last night. I spent today in Rick's room with the curtains drawn, writing this, because I don't know how much longer I'll have before my fingers and limbs start locking up. Looking up the effects of rigor mortis knowing that it'll be happening to me soon wasn't fun. I already feel cold, and it doesn't matter how many blankets I cover myself with, it's never enough. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I do know that if I survive the change as myself, I'll have the freedom to choose, at least. Killing Rick broke the bond that I would've had with the Shadow, too. At least there's that.",3,1758197887.0,nosleep,2,0.81,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
