# Best Bleached Tee 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

Bleached tees have surged in popularity, becoming a staple in modern wardrobes. They offer a unique blend of individuality and comfort, allowing wearers to express their personal style effortlessly. Each bleached tee is essentially a canvas,making it highly sought after by those who value originality in their clothing.

The appeal lies in the unpredictable nature of the bleaching process. No two tees are exactly alike, ensuring that each piece is truly one-of-a-kind. As we move into 2025, the demand for high-quality, creatively bleached tees continues to rise. This article reviews some of the top contenders in the market,offering insights into their key features,benefits,and overall value.

## Key Features Analysis

The best bleached tees of 2025 boast a combination of quality materials, unique designs, and durable construction.

**Material Quality**

The foundation of any good tee is its fabric.Look for 100% cotton or cotton blends that offer both comfort and breathability. Premium ringspun cotton is a top choice due to its softness and durability. Heavier weight fabrics, such as those around 5-6 oz, tend to hold up better over time and provide a more ample feel. Lower quality materials may fade or lose shape after onyl a few washes making the fabric of utmost importance.

**Bleaching Technique**

The artistry of a bleached tee lies in the bleaching process itself. Different techniques create different effects, from subtle tie-dye patterns to bold, graphic designs. Reverse tie-dye, ice dye, and bleach splatter techniques are all popular.The skill of the artisan directly impacts the tee's aesthetic appeal. Ideally, the bleaching process includes neutralizing agents to prevent further degradation of the fabric.

**seam Construction**

Durable seam construction is critical for a tee that will withstand repeated wear and washing. Look for double-needle stitching at the seams and hems.This reinforces the garment and prevents unraveling. Side-seamed construction is also preferable to tubular construction, as it provides a more tailored fit and prevents twisting after washing. Quality stitching ensures the longevity of the tee.**Color Fastness**

While bleaching inherently removes color, the base color of the tee should be fade-resistant. High-quality dyeing processes ensure that the base color remains vibrant, even after repeated washes. Some manufacturers pre-shrink their tees to minimize shrinkage and maintain the overall fit over time. Good color fastness is vital to maintain quality of the garment.

   Fade-Resistant Colors

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

She said,

Reminding me of the threads
that were neatly woven into my self 
Symmetrical, intricate and best.
Ah, a classic Persian rug,
Hung proudly on a wall
Across the Mashhad bazaar.

""Just be thyself,""
She said,
Not knowing that I would dread
When a remark like this is said.

Once dyed in red threads 
Fiery and passionate,
Like the flames curling
from a dragon's head.

And then I was dyed blue.
Red, extinguished by ocean‚Äôs hue.
Now I'm calm, tamed, and new.
From walls to under feet 
That‚Äôs how my fate reshaped me.

Once, I was fire.
Now, I am just blue.
Still pretty.
Then, trying to consume.
Now, wishing they'd drown
into my corals, my hues, my blues.

But coffee spilled.
People overstepped.
They made me lose my charm 
The ocean in me lost its depth.

Now I look somewhat brown,
An old queen without her crown.

Which ""one of me"" is me?
I ask myself again:

The red, the blue or now brown?
The fire, the water, or the sand?

Which one of me is me?
Just another Persian carpet,
Neatly woven then, now worn out,
Lying forgotten in a storeroom 

From where it overhears an echo
""Just be thyself.""

Which‚Ä¶ lol. Not happening with my ADHD brain.

But once I let go of doing it the ‚Äúright‚Äù way and made it ADHD-friendly, it actually started helping. Not perfect, but it‚Äôs made me less reactive, a bit more focused, and way nicer to myself.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for me:

üß† **3-Minute Breathing Space**  
‚Üí 1 min: Notice what‚Äôs going on (thoughts, feelings)  
‚Üí 1 min: Focus on your breath  
‚Üí 1 min: Expand awareness to body/surroundings  
(I walk around while doing this if sitting still is too much.)

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Walking meditation**  
Slow-ish walking while paying attention to your feet, breath, or steps.  
(Good for when your brain or body‚Äôs buzzing.)

üé® **Mindful activities**  
Cooking, music, petting my dog ‚Äî just doing one thing fully and noticing the senses. No multitasking.

üì± **Mini check-ins**  
Random phone reminders that just say ‚Äúbreathe.‚Äù I stop, take 3 breaths, ask: ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my mind right now?‚Äù

üò§ **Naming emotions**  
If I feel myself heating up, I pause and name it (‚Äúfrustration,‚Äù ‚Äúoverwhelm‚Äù). Somehow helps me not go full meltdown.

What helped me stick with it:

* Start tiny (60‚Äì90 seconds)
* Link it to existing habits (coffee, brushing teeth)
* No guilt if I forget ‚Äî that just adds stress
* Sometimes I call it ‚Äúpause time‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmindfulness‚Äù üòÖ

Not saying I‚Äôve got it all figured out, but it‚Äôs helped me ride the ADHD chaos with a little more awareness and a lot less self-criticism.

I told her that I sure could, but I don't have prior experience specifically with weddings. She said that she isn't expecting super high quality photos, she just wants photos that are better than her phone's photos.

While my camera photos will undoubtedly be better than theirs; what should I be looking for? What shots should I be taking or ask for? How much should I expect to be paid according toy skill? (Note: I do edit all of my photos AND print many of them out on fancy postcard sized paper.)

So mainly, I just have no idea what kind of photos I should be taking or when to take them. What should I expect?

1mkw4b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mkw4b6/i_got_blindly_accused_of_stealing_by_my_sil/,I got blindly accused of stealing by my SIL,"I don't even know how to start this. It will be a long post and I'm sorry for that.

Recently my husband and I got back from his sister's house. Since my husband is moving to my country, we took some of his belongings and his late father's belongings too. We stayed there for a few months. 

For some background, I come from a poorer country. I grew up very poor. We didn't have a lot at home. My parents had to make many sacrifices for me. 

However, everything I have accomplished was with honest, hard work. I worked abroad at the age of 18 to help my family and to get myself ready for graduation so they don't have to spend a lot of money on my dress and accessories. I worked long night shifts to pay for college even when my late grandpa helped with my tuition sometimes. I worked overtime and even weeks with no break in-between. For my master's degree, I also worked and paid for my tuition there too while studying. When I was younger, there would be temptations all around me to make ""dirty"" money. But I never gave into that. I was never raised that way. In school, I had good grades that landed me scholarships. When I graduated from high school, I had a good final grade and my high school gave me a final scholarship too. A small amount of money. All I wanted then was to do well in school, to get educated, to work hard, to make a career for myself and to make my parents proud of me. In my family, we pride ourselves on our hard work and honesty. 

 When my father (rest in peace) got sick, my teenage years were spent in hospitals, at pharmacies, helping him get groceries, etc while my mom worked her a$$ off to support us. I'd give 50% of my paychecks to them to afford medication, pay bills, put food on the table. The first time I actually went to a caf√©, was when I was 18 working abroad. I sat at the caf√© corner, with a bottle of coke and a cup of coffee and I felt like a normal human being. I cried that day.

When my father died when I was 22, my mom and I paid for the funeral, but I had to do most documentation, I had to go through hell and back alone while juggling work, social life (which at that point I barely had), university, home, helping my mom get through it all. Never, even at my lowest, would I ever think of stealing or committing any foul deed.

But. My parents raised me right. They raised me to obey rules and understand consequences, to be honest, to use my head and do the right thing, to never steal, to always ask before taking anything. 

When we were there at my SILs, I'd always ask if I can take anything. Even food. I would always ask. 

Everything I have taken back home with me was either things my husband bought me, things from free pantries/charities or things that were given to me when nobody wanted them. I was never there to take other people's belongings because I know that they've paid for them and worked for them. Despite some presumptions I'd hear about me from some of my husband's family. Things like I'm with him for a green card or money. I have my master's degree, I speak multiple languages, I have a lot of experience under my belt. If I wanted money, I can make it myself. I have a home. I am with my husband because he stayed with me through thick and thin. He loved me and still loves me as much as I love him too. We have a great relationship and communication. Many times when I'd ask to see something, out of curiosity or to see if I can fix something like a pair of sandals that were uncomfortable for my SIL, I'd be looked at like I'm there to steal their food, or items. 

So what happened is that instead of asking me like a human being if we had accidentally taken my mom-in-law's wedding band while packing, my husband and I got blocked off of every social media and in a text message aimed to me was ""Why did she take mom's ring?"" from my SIL

I love my mom in law, I helped take care of her when she lived with us in my country. She's going through a mental issue and sometimes I'd talk to her about her late husband whom she wholeheartedly loved. Just to reminisce about the times she was happier.


I never took anything without permission. Again, I was raised to always ask. My husband took his dad's wedding bands but he is my SILs brother. She knew about that. This is between them. 

I ask myself, why? Why reach out like that? Why directly assume it was me? After everything I've done for everyone, why assume such a horrible thing about me? Why couldn't she ask me if we took anything that we didn't ask for like I'm a human being?  Why did she made me trust her and believe she likes me and that we're friends and then spit in my face, and in my parents' faces, and my country like that? Why couldn't we just hold a normal conversation and clear things out instead of throwing such an accusation?

Is it because I'm from a poorer country? Is it the crap she may have heard from the same people who blindly before even meeting me has presumptions about me? Why would I throw sand in my MILs eyes like that and take something so valuable to her when I love her so much? What kind of a monster did she think I was? 

My husband defended me. He always has. I feel so bad that he'd be treated this way from his own flesh and blood he truly loved.

I don't know how to feel. I feel betrayed, hurt, disappointed. I feel like all my good deeds have gone unnoticed all because of an assumption. All the times I was there for them and done so much and she'd make me feel comfortable, liked, accepted for who I am and all of a sudden, without even reaching out and asking, she'd just spit in my face. All because of an assumption. I really feel hurt and sickened. I feel so much yet nothing at all. I don't know how to process this. 

My mom and dad made sure I have good morals, to empathize, and such an offense not only hurts me, but also the people who created me and made so many sacrifices and compromises to put me in the right way and teach me to do the right thing. 

I am sorry for the long post. If you are reading this, thank you for doing so. Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that. ",1,1754661880.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

+20,000 miles cycled
+1.5 million ft of elevation gain
 
In truth I‚Äôm so ready to be done. It‚Äôs like reaching your physical and mental capacity by noon each day, with no choice but to keep pushing past it over and over again without end. Things never got any easier. I wanted to give up in Guatemala, in Peru, in Bolivia. I laid down on the rocks and prayed for a truck to crush me, but they never came. I almost quit just days from the finish line when headwinds topped 60 mph [100 kmh]. Winds so strong that I could barely walk the bike upright, never mind pedaling. You just have to find a way to keep going.
 
Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions for those interested:
 
1. How did you cross the Dari√©n Gap?
 
Met up with a Colombian sailor on the Caribbean side of Panama. We lashed my bike to the mast and sailed to Cartagena. This added several hundred miles of extra cycling in the process, but Colombia‚Äôs Northeast Cordillera ended up being a highlight of the entire journey. I wrote about it for The Travel Almanac!
 
2. Did you have any dangerous encounters with wildlife or people?
 
Daily wildlife encounters up north including grizzlies, moose and rabid wolves (wrote about that for Men‚Äôs Fitness magazine, very scary), but no troubles thereafter.
 
Mexico and Colombia were supposed to be the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù countries, but ended up being my two favorite. It helps that I speak Spanish, but so often when I would stop to ask locals for directions or advice as to safe camping, they would invite me inside instead, offering food and a bed [their own bed]. Friendly drivers would get out of their vehicles at stoplights to gift snacks, water, or just plain uplifting conversation.
 
Petty theft and violent crime do still happen obviously, so I‚Äôd read all the horror stories and explored accordingly. Women of course might have a far different experience than a 6‚Äô4‚Äù white American male too, with exponentially greater potential dangers to balance en route. But the only times I‚Äôve ever been robbed or hit by a car were in the USA.
 
3. Can I read more about your journey somewhere, and what now?
 
I‚Äôve been writing a full book en route that tells the linear bike travelogue interwoven with a memoir regarding my estranged mom‚Äôs death while I was still in Alaska ‚Äì with whom I hadn‚Äôt spoken since escaping their religious cult as a teenager ‚Äì and how these two arcs converge in the peripatetic search for familial belonging. Meanwhile, started publishing a newspaper dispatch called Wayfaring Strangers for printed bits of kaleidoscopic travel writing and photography if interested in more (links ‚§¥Ô∏è in profile bio).
 
Glad to answer any further questions too if something comes to mind. Immense thanks for everyone‚Äôs kind words of encouragement en route üôåüèº Let‚Äôs get some coffee and go for a bike ride!",22,1754661626.0,gravelcycling,3,0.96,False

¬† EARLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR  
  
¬† Leslie slipped into her school uniform and got ready as quickly as she could. She closed her bedroom door softly, staying quiet so she could get out of the house before her father woke. Being retired wasn‚Äôt good for him. He‚Äôd been a decent father before‚Äîbefore Mom left, before he‚Äôd fallen into a bottle, be  
fore he‚Äôd started taking trips to Atlantic City and gods knew where else.  
  
¬† She headed to the kitchen, where she found her brother, Ren, at the table, pipe in hand. Wearing nothing but a pair of ratty jeans, his blond hair loose around his face, he seemed relaxed and friendly. Sometimes he even was.  
  
¬† He looked up and offered a cherubic smile. ‚ÄúWant a hit?‚Äù  
  
¬† She shook her head and opened the cupboard, looking for a tolerably clean cup. None. She pulled a can of soda from the meat drawer in the fridge. After Ren had doped a bottle‚Äîand thereby doped her‚Äîshe‚Äôd learned to drink only from still-sealed containers.  
  
¬† Ren watched her, content in his chemical cloud, smiling in a perversely angelic way. When he was friendly and just smoking pot, it was a good day. Ren-on-Pot wasn‚Äôt a problem: pot just made him mellow. It was Ren-on-Anything-Else that was unpredictable.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs chips over there if you want some breakfast.‚Äù He pointed to a mostly empty bag of corn chips on the counter.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She grabbed a couple and opened the freezer to get the toaster waffles she‚Äôd hidden. They were gone. She opened the cupboard and pulled out a box of the only type of cereal her brother didn‚Äôt eat‚Äîgranola. It was nasty, but his pilfering stopped at the healthy stuff, so she stocked up on it.  
  
¬† She poured her cereal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo milk left,‚Äù Ren mumbled, eyes closed.  
  
¬† Sighing softly, Leslie sat down with her bowl of dry granola. No fights. No troubles. Being home always made her feel like she was walking on a high wire, waiting for a gust of wind to knock her to the ground.  
  
¬† The kitchen smelled strongly of weed. She remembered when she used to wake up to the scent of eggs and bacon, when Dad would brew fresh coffee, when things were normal. It hadn‚Äôt been like that for more than a year.  
  
¬† Ren plunked his bare feet on the kitchen table. It was covered with junk‚Äînews circulars, bills to pay, dirty dishes, and a mostly empty bottle of bourbon.  
  
¬† While she ate, she opened the important bills‚Äîelectric and water. With relief, she saw that Dad had actually paid ahead on both of them. He did that when he had a good run of luck at the tables or a few sober days: sent extra on the big bills so it wouldn‚Äôt be a hassle later. It didn‚Äôt help for groceries or the cable bill, which was overdue again, but she could usually cover those when she had to.  
  
¬† Not this time, though. She‚Äôd finally decided to go through with it, to get a tattoo. She‚Äôd been wanting one for a while but hadn‚Äôt felt ready. In the last few months, she‚Äôd become near obsessed with it. Waiting wasn‚Äôt the answer, not anymore. She thought about that act far too often‚Äîmarking her body, reclaiming it as her own, a step she needed to take to make herself whole again.  
  
¬† Now I just need to find the right image.  
  
¬† With what she hoped was a friendly smile, she asked Ren, ‚ÄúDo you have any money for cable?‚Äù  
  
¬† He shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe. What‚Äôs it worth to you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bargaining. I just want to know if you can cover cable this month.‚Äù  
  
¬† He took a long hit off his pipe and exhaled into her face. ‚ÄúNot if you‚Äôre going to be a bitch about it. I have expenses. If you can‚Äôt do a guy a favor now and then, make nice with my friends‚Äù‚Äîhe shrugged‚Äî‚Äúyou pay it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know what? I don‚Äôt need cable.‚Äù She walked over to the trash and dropped the bill in the can, fighting back the sickness in her throat at the mention of making nice with his friends, wishing that someone in her family cared about what happened to her.  
  
¬† If Mom hadn‚Äôt taken off‚Ä¶  
  
¬† But she had. She‚Äôd bailed and left Leslie behind to deal with her brother and father. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be better this way, baby,‚Äù she‚Äôd said. It wasn‚Äôt. Leslie wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôd want to talk to her mom anymore‚Äînot that it mattered. She had no contact information at all.  
  
¬† Leslie shook her head. Thinking about that wouldn‚Äôt help her cope with her current reality. She started to walk past Ren, but he stood up and grabbed her for a hug. She was stiff in his arms.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? Are you on the rag again?‚Äù He laughed, amused by his crass joke, amused by her anger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNever mind, Ren. Just forget I‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay the bill. Relax.‚Äù He let go of her, and as soon as he let his arm drop, she stepped away, hoping the scent of pot and cigarettes wouldn‚Äôt cling to her too obviously. Sometimes she suspected that Father Meyers knew exactly how much things had changed for her, but she still didn‚Äôt want to walk into school reeking.  
  
¬† She put on her fake smile and murmured, ‚ÄúThanks, Ren.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of it. You just remember it next time I need you to come out with me. You‚Äôre a good distraction when I need credit.‚Äù He looked at her calculatingly.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt reply. There wasn‚Äôt an answer that would help. If she said no, he‚Äôd be a prick, but she wasn‚Äôt saying yes. After what his druggie friends did‚Äîwhat he let them do‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt going anywhere near them again.  
  
¬† Instead of rehashing that argument, she went and grabbed the bill out of the trash. ‚ÄúThanks for taking care of it.‚Äù  
  
¬† She handed it to him. Right now, it didn‚Äôt matter if he did it or not: she couldn‚Äôt pay the cable bill and get ink, and really, she didn‚Äôt watch cable enough to justify paying for it. Mostly, she paid it because she was embarrassed by the idea of anyone finding out that her family couldn‚Äôt pay a bill, as if by keeping it normal as long as possible maybe it‚Äôd get normal. It kept her from facing the inevitable pity and whispers if everyone found out how lame her father had become since Mom left, if they found out just how low her brother had gotten.  
  
¬† By fall she‚Äôd be in college, escaped from here, away from them. Just like Mom did‚Äîescape. Sometimes she wondered if her mother had been escaping something she didn‚Äôt want Leslie to know about. If so, her mother‚Äôs leaving made more sense‚Äîbut her leaving Leslie behind made less sense. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Leslie had already sent out her first-choice applications and applied for a bunch of scholarships. That‚Äôs what matters‚Äîgetting a plan and getting out. Next year she‚Äôd be safe, in a new city, in a new life.  
  
¬† But that didn‚Äôt stop the wave of terror she felt as Ren lifted his bourbon in a silent salute.  
  
¬† Without another word, she grabbed her bag.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCatch you later, sis,‚Äù Ren called, before he turned his attention to packing another bowl.  
  
¬† No. You won‚Äôt.  
  
¬† By the time Leslie walked up the steps to Bishop O‚ÄôConnell High School, her fears were safely tucked back in their box. She‚Äôd gotten better at watching for the warning signs‚Äîthe tense calls that meant Ren was in trouble again, the strangers in the house. She worked extra if there were too many warning signs. She‚Äôd put locks on her bedroom door. She didn‚Äôt drink out of open bottles. Her safeguards didn‚Äôt undo what was, but they helped avoid what could be.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeslie! Hold up,‚Äù Aislinn called out from behind her.  
  
¬† Leslie stopped and waited, schooling her face to be bland and calm, not that it mattered: Aislinn had been lost in her own world lately. A few months ago, she‚Äôd hooked up with the all-too-yummy Seth. They‚Äôd been practically dating anyhow, so that wasn‚Äôt so weird. What was weird was that Aislinn had simultaneously developed a very intense relationship with another guy, Keenan. Somehow neither guy seemed to object to the other.  
  
¬† The guys who‚Äôd walked Aislinn to school stood watching her from across the street while she caught up to Leslie. Keenan and Niall, his uncle, didn‚Äôt move from their post, seeming far too serious‚Äîand apparently oblivious to the number of people watching them like they were members of the Living Zombies. Leslie wondered if Niall played an instrument. He was sexier than any of the Zombies. If he played or sang too‚Ä¶he‚Äôd be halfway to success just by looking so delicious. He had a mysterious aura, plus he was a couple years older than Leslie and Aislinn‚Äîa college sophomore maybe. Add that oddly sexy responsibility thing‚Äîhe was one of Keenan‚Äôs guardians, an uncle, but still young‚Äîand he seemed like a perfect package, one she was staring at again.  
  
¬† When he smiled and waved, Leslie had to force herself not to go  
toward him. She always felt like that when he looked at her. There was an illogical urge to run toward him, like something was coiled too tightly inside her and the only way to ease the tension was to go to him. She didn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt about to make a fool of herself over a guy who hadn‚Äôt shown any genuine interest. Maybe he would, though. So far, their only contact had been under the watchful eye of Keenan or Aislinn, and that was usually interrupted by Aislinn‚Äôs flimsy excuses to go somewhere away from Niall.  
  
¬† Aislinn put her hand on Leslie‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù  
  
¬† And, like they had so often, they walked away from Niall.  
  
¬† Leslie turned her attention to Aislinn. ‚ÄúWow. Rianne said you were crazy tan, but I didn‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aislinn‚Äôs perpetually pale skin was perfectly tan, as if she‚Äôd been living on a beach, as tan as Keenan always was. It hadn‚Äôt been that way on Friday. Aislinn bit down on her lip‚Äîa nervous habit that usually meant she was feeling cornered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs some winter thing‚ÄîSAD, they called it‚Äîso I needed to get some sunlight.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Leslie tried to keep the doubt out of her voice and failed. Aislinn didn‚Äôt seem depressed at all‚Äîor to have reason to be depressed lately. In fact, she seemed like she‚Äôd become rather flush with money and attention. A few times when Leslie had seen her out with Keenan, both of them had been wearing matching twisted golden necklaces that fit snugly around their throats. The clothes that Aislinn wore, the new winter coats, the chauffeurs, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs not forget‚ÄîSeth‚Äôs being cool with all of it. Depressed? Yeah, right.

Did you go over the reading for Lit?‚Äù Aislinn pulled open the door and they joined the throng of people in the halls.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe had a dinner thing out of town, so I didn‚Äôt finish.‚Äù Leslie gave an exaggerated eye roll. ‚ÄúRen even dressed with all the required pieces of clothing.‚Äù  
  
¬† They both continued to steer the conversation away from topics they didn‚Äôt want to address. Leslie lied easily, but Aislinn seemed determined to direct the conversation toward neutral subjects. Eventually, she glanced behind her‚Äîas if there were someone there‚Äîand made another random topic switch: ‚ÄúAre you still working over at Verlaine‚Äôs?‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie looked: there wasn‚Äôt anyone there. ‚ÄúSure. It drives Dad mad that I wait tables, and you know, gives me a good excuse if I need to explain my weird hours.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie didn‚Äôt admit that she had to work or that her father didn‚Äôt have a clue what she did for money. She wasn‚Äôt sure her father knew she had a job or that she paid the bills. He might have thought Ren was doing it, although he probably didn‚Äôt realize Ren was dealing‚Äîor selling me‚Äîto get his money. Talking about money, home, and Ren was so not the sort of conversation she wanted to have, so she took a turn shifting the topic. With a conspiratorial grin, she looped her arm around Aislinn‚Äôs waist and assumed the facade she adopted with her friends. ‚ÄúSo, let‚Äôs talk about Keenan‚Äôs sexy uncle. What‚Äôs the scoop on him? Is he seeing anyone?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNiall? He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶he‚Äôs not, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Aislinn frowned. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to mess with him. There‚Äôs prettier‚Ä¶I mean, better‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI doubt that, sweetie. Your vision‚Äôs clouded by staring at Seth too long.‚Äù Leslie patted Aislinn‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúNiall‚Äôs top shelf.‚Äù  
  
¬† His face was as beautiful as Keenan‚Äôs but in a different way: Niall‚Äôs had character. One long scar ran from his temple to the corner of his mouth, and he wasn‚Äôt shy about it. His hair was cut so short that there was no chance of anything detracting from the beauty of that jagged line. And his body‚Ä¶wow. He was all sinew and length, moving like he had been training in some long-lost martial art since birth. Leslie couldn‚Äôt figure why anyone would notice Keenan when Niall was around. Keenan was attractive enough, with his unnatural green eyes, perfect body, and sandy-blond hair. He was gorgeous, but he moved in a way that always made Leslie think he wasn‚Äôt quite meant for civilization. He frightened her. Niall, on the other hand, was luscious and seemed sweet‚Äîkind in a way that Keenan wasn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Leslie prompted, ‚ÄúSo relationships‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt, umm, do relationships.‚Äù Aislinn spoke softly. ‚ÄúAnyhow, he‚Äôs too old.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie let it drop for the moment. Although Aislinn was spending much of her time ‚Äúnot-dating‚Äù Keenan, she kept her school friends separate from Keenan‚Äôs crowd as much as possible. When they did intersect, Aislinn clung to Leslie like an extra limb, giving no opportunities for Leslie to have conversations with anyone who hung around Keenan‚Äîmost especially Niall. For a moment, Leslie wondered if she‚Äôd be so intrigued by Niall if it weren‚Äôt for Aislinn‚Äôs playing keep-away. The more Aislinn acted as an obstacle, the more Leslie wanted nearer Niall. An older guy with a drool-worthy body and seemingly no bad habits to speak of and somehow forbidden: how could that not be appealing?  
  
¬† But Aislinn‚Äôs plate was overfilled with Seth and Keenan, so maybe she just wasn‚Äôt getting it. Or maybe she knows something. Leslie forced that thought away: if Aislinn had a legitimate reason to think Niall was bad news, she‚Äôd say something. They might be in the middle of this weird dance of secrecy, but they were still friends.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLes!‚Äù Rianne shoved through the crowd with her usual exuberance. ‚ÄúDid I miss seeing the dessert tray?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust two of the tasty treats today‚Ä¶‚Äù Leslie linked her arm through Rianne‚Äôs as they made their way toward their lockers. Rianne was reliably good at keeping things light.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo dark-and-pierced wasn‚Äôt on duty?‚Äù Rianne flashed a wicked grin at Aislinn, who blushed predictably.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo Seth. Today was blond-and-moody along with scarred-and-sexy.‚Äù Leslie winked at Aislinn, enjoying the brief moments of normalcy, of smiling. Rianne brought that in her wake, and Leslie was ever grateful for it. They stopped in front of Aislinn‚Äôs locker, and Leslie added, ‚ÄúOur little dessert hoarder was just going to tell me when we‚Äôre all going out dancing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, not‚Äî‚Äù Aislinn started.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSooner or later, you‚Äôre going to need to share the wealth, Ash. We‚Äôre feeling deprived. Weakened.‚Äù Rianne sighed and leaned heavily on Leslie. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling faint with it.‚Äù  
  
¬† And for a moment, Leslie saw a look of longing pass over Aislinn‚Äôs face, but then Aislinn caught her watching.  
  
¬† Aislinn‚Äôs face turned impassive. ‚ÄúSometimes I wish I could‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rianne opened her mouth to respond, but Leslie shook her head. ‚ÄúGive us a sec, Ri. I‚Äôll catch up.‚Äù  
  
¬† After Rianne left, Leslie caught Aislinn‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúI wish we weren‚Äôt doing this‚Ä¶.‚Äù She gestured between them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Aislinn grew so still and silent in the din of the hall, it was like the noise around them vanished for an instant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLying.‚Äù Leslie sighed. ‚ÄúI miss us being real friends, Ash. I‚Äôm not going to encroach on your scene, but it‚Äôd be nice to be straight-up again. I miss you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying. I‚Ä¶can‚Äôt lie.‚Äù She stared beyond Leslie for a moment, scowling at someone.  
  
¬† Leslie didn‚Äôt turn to see who it was. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not being honest, either. If you don‚Äôt want me around‚Ä¶‚Äù She shrugged. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aislinn grabbed her arms and held her close. Although she tried, Leslie actually couldn‚Äôt pull away.  
  
¬† A jerk passing in the hall called, ‚ÄúDykes.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie tensed, torn between the once-instantaneous urge to flip him off and the still-new fear of conflict.  
  
¬† The bell rang. Lockers slammed. Aislinn finally said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to see you get hurt. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶people and things‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSweetie, I doubt they‚Äôre any worse than what‚Äî‚Äù She stopped herself, unable to say the sentences that would follow. Her heart thunked at the thought of saying those words aloud. She shook her arm. ‚ÄúCan you let go? I‚Äôve still got to go to my locker.‚Äù  
  
¬† Aislinn released her, and Leslie left before she had to figure out how to answer the inevitable questions that would follow her almost admission. Talking won‚Äôt change it. But sometimes it was what she wanted most, to tell someone; often, though, she just wanted to not feel those horrid feelings, to escape herself, so there was no pain, no fear, no ugliness.  
  
¬† CHAPTER 2  
  
¬† After school Leslie headed out before Aislinn or Rianne had a chance to catch up with her. She‚Äôd spent her free period in the library reading more on the history of tattooing, the centuries-old traditions of marking the body. The reasons‚Äîranging from adopting a totem animal‚Äôs nature to marking life events to offering visual cues to identify criminals‚Äîfascinated her. More important, they resonated with her.  
  
¬† When she walked in the door of Pins and Needles, the cowbell clanged.  
  
¬† Rabbit glanced over his shoulder.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBe right with you,‚Äù he called. As the man beside him talked, Rabbit absently ran a hand over his white-and-blue-dyed hair.  
  
¬† Leslie lifted a hand in greeting and walked past him. This week he had left a tiny goatee directing attention to his labret piercing. It was that piercing under his lower lip that had caught her attention the first time Ani and Tish had brought her to the shop. Within a week, she‚Äôd had her own piercing‚Äîhidden under her blouse‚Äîand found herself spending time in the studio.  
  
¬† She felt safe there‚Äîaway from Bishop O.C., away from the unpleasantness of her father‚Äôs drunkenness, away from whatever letches Ren brought home to share his drug of the week. At Pins and Needles she could be safe, quiet, relaxed‚Äîall the things she couldn‚Äôt be most other places.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, always use new needles,‚Äù Rabbit repeated to the prospective customer.  
  
¬† As Leslie walked around the shop, sh  
e listened to the snatches of Rabbit‚Äôs comments that wound into the silence between songs: ‚ÄúAutoclave‚Ä¶sterile as a hospital.‚Äù  
  
¬† The man‚Äôs gaze drifted lazily over the flash on the walls, but he wasn‚Äôt there to buy. He was tense, ready to bolt. His eyes were too wide. His posture was nervous‚Äîarms folded, body closed in on itself. Despite the number of people who came through the shop, only a few would actually lay down money for art. He wasn‚Äôt one of them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a couple questions,‚Äù she called out to Rabbit.  
  
¬† With a grateful smile at her, Rabbit excused himself from the man, telling him, ‚ÄúIf you want to look around‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie walked over to the far wall, where she flipped through the flash‚Äîimages that could be bought by and put on as many people as liked them. Flowers and crosses, tribal patterns and geometric designs‚Äîmany were beautiful, but no matter how long she stared at them, none seemed right. The small rooms branching off the main room had other styles that were less appealing: old-school pinup girls, skeletal figures, cartoon characters, slogans, and animals.  
  
¬† Rabbit came up behind her, but she didn‚Äôt tense, didn‚Äôt feel that urge to turn so she couldn‚Äôt be cornered. It was Rabbit. Rabbit was safe.  
  
¬† He said, ‚ÄúNothing new there, Les.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù She flipped the poster frame board that rested against the wall. One image was of a green vine entwined around a half-human woman; she looked like she was being strangled but smiled as if it felt good. Idiotic. Leslie flipped again. Obscure symbols with translations underneath covered the next screen. Not my style.  
  
¬† Rabbit laughed, a smoker‚Äôs raspy laugh, although he didn‚Äôt smoke and claimed he never had. ‚ÄúWith as much time as you‚Äôve spent looking the past months, you‚Äôd have found it by now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie turned and scowled up at Rabbit. ‚ÄúSo design something for me. I‚Äôm ready now, Rabbit. I want to do this.‚Äù  
  
¬† Off to the side, the would-be customer paused to look at a couple of the rings in the glass case.  
  
¬† With an uneasy shrug, Rabbit said, ‚ÄúTold you before. You want custom work, you bring me an idea. Something. I can‚Äôt design without references.‚Äù  
  
¬† The bell clanged as the man left.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo help me find an idea. Please? You‚Äôve had my parental consent form for weeks.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt backing down this time. Getting ink felt right, like it would help her put her life in order, to move forward. It was her body, despite the things that‚Äôd been done to it, and she wanted to claim it, to own it, to prove that to herself. She knew it wasn‚Äôt magic, but the idea of writing her own identity felt like the closest she could get to reclaiming her life. Sometimes there‚Äôs power in the act; sometimes there‚Äôs strength in words. She wanted to find an image that represented those things she was feeling, to etch it on her skin as tangible proof of her decision to change.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRabbit? I need this. You told me to think. I‚Äôve thought. I need‚Ä¶‚Äù She stared out at the people passing on the street, wondering if the men who‚Äôd‚Ä¶if they were out there. She wouldn‚Äôt recognize them since Ren had drugged her before he gave her to them. She pulled her gaze back to Rabbit and was uncharacteristically blunt, telling him what she couldn‚Äôt tell Aislinn earlier: ‚ÄúI need to change, Rabbit. I‚Äôm drowning here. I need something, or I‚Äôm not going to make it. Maybe a tattoo isn‚Äôt the right answer, but right now it‚Äôs something I can do‚Ä¶. I need this. Help me?‚Äù  
  
¬† He paused, an oddly hesitant look on his face. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pursue this.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ani and Tish peeked around the corner, waved, and wandered over to the stereo. The song changed to something darker, with heavy bass and growling lyrics. The volume grew loud enough that Leslie could feel the percussion.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAni!‚Äù Rabbit shot a frown toward his sister.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShop‚Äôs empty now.‚Äù Ani cocked her hip and stared at him, unrepentant. She never cowered, no matter how grumpy Rabbit sounded. It wasn‚Äôt like he‚Äôd hurt her, though. He treated his sisters like they were the most precious things he‚Äôd ever seen. It was one of the things Leslie found comforting about him. Guys who treated their family well were safe and good‚Äîguys like her father and brother, not so much.  
  
¬† Rabbit stared at Leslie for several seconds before he said, ‚ÄúQuick fixes aren‚Äôt what you need. You need to face what you‚Äôre running from.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease? I want this.‚Äù She felt tears sting her eyes. Rabbit suspected too much, and she didn‚Äôt want pep talks. She wanted something she didn‚Äôt have words for‚Äîpeace, numbness, something. She stared at him, trying to figure out what to say to convince him, trying to figure out why he wouldn‚Äôt help her. All she had was ‚ÄúPlease, Rabbit?‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked away then and motioned for her to follow him. They stepped through the short hallway to his office. Rabbit unlocked it and led her into the tiny room.  
  
¬† She stopped just inside the doorway, less comfortable but still okay. The room was barely big enough for the things he had crammed into it. A massive dark wood desk and two file cabinets took up the back wall; a long counter cluttered with various artists‚Äô tools and media stretched the length of the right wall; the third wall had a matching counter with two printers, a scanner, a projector, and a series of unlabeled jars.  
  
¬† He pulled another key out of his pocket and unlocked a drawer on the desk. Saying nothing yet, he pulled out a thin brown book with words impressed into the cover. Then he sat down in his chair and stared at her until she felt like running, as if everything she knew about him had faded and he were somehow unsafe.  
  
¬† This is Rabbit.  
  
¬† She felt embarrassed by her brief fear. Rabbit was like the older brother she should‚Äôve had, a true friend. He hadn‚Äôt ever offered her anything other than respect.  
  
¬† She walked up to the desk and sat on it.  
  
¬† He held her gaze and asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you looking for?‚Äù  
  
¬† They‚Äôd talked enough that she knew he didn‚Äôt mean what sort of picture, but what it represented. A tattoo wasn‚Äôt about the thing itself, but what it meant.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeing safe. No more fear or pain.‚Äù She couldn‚Äôt look at him when she said it, but she had said it. That counted for something.  
  
¬† Rabbit flipped open the book to a section midway through and sat it in her lap. ‚ÄúHere. These are mine. They‚Äôre special. They‚Äôre like‚Ä¶symbols of change. If the one you need is in here‚Ä¶just‚Ä¶do any of these feel like what you need?‚Äù  
  
¬† Images cluttered the page‚Äîintricate Celtic patterns, eyes peering from behind thorny vines, grotesque bodies with wicked smiles, animals too unreal to look at for long, symbols her eyes darted away from as soon as she glanced at them. They were stunning and tempting and repulsive, but for one image that set her nerves on edge: inky-black eyes gazed up from within black-and-gray knotwork surrounded by wings like coalescing shadows, and in the middle was a chaos star. Eight arrows pointed away from the center; four of these were thicker, like the lines of a spiked cross.  
  
¬† Mine. The thought, the need, the reaction were overpowering. Her stomach clenched. She pulled her gaze away, and then forced herself to keep looking. She looked at the other tattoos, but her attention returned to that image as if compelled by it. That one‚Äôs mine. For a moment, some trick of light made it look as if one of the eyes in the image winked. She ran her finger over the page, feeling the slick-smooth plastic sheet covering it, imagining the feel of those wings wrapped around her‚Äîsomehow jagged and velvety all at once. She looked up at Rabbit. ‚ÄúThis one. I need this one.‚Äù  
  
¬† A strange series of expressions came over Rabbit, as if he weren‚Äôt sure if he should be surprised, pleased, or terrified. He took the book and closed it. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you think about it for a few days‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She put a hand on his wrist. ‚ÄúI am sure. I‚Äôm past ready, and this image‚Ä¶If it‚Äôd been on the wall, I‚Äôd already have it on me.‚Äù She shivered, not liking the idea of anyone else having her tattoo‚Äîand it was hers. She knew it. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a one-time-only tattoo. If you get it, no one else can, but‚Äù‚Äîhe stared at the wall behind her‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äôll change you, change things.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll tattoos change  
people.‚Äù She tried to keep her voice even, but she felt frustrated by his hesitation. He‚Äôd been stalling for weeks. This was her tattoo, right there within reach.  
  
¬† Studiously avoiding her gaze, Rabbit slid the book into its drawer. ‚ÄúThose things you were looking for‚Ä¶those changes‚Ä¶you need to be absolutely positive those are the ones you want.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù She tried to get him to look at her, bending down so her face was closer to his.  
  
¬† Ani poked her head in the doorway. ‚ÄúShe pick one?‚Äù  
  
¬† Rabbit ignored her. ‚ÄúTell me what you thought when you picked it. Were there any others that‚Ä¶called to you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. Just that one. I want it. Soon. Now.‚Äù  
  
¬† And she did. It felt like she was looking at a banquet and realizing she hadn‚Äôt ever eaten, like a craving that she needed to fill immediately.  
  
¬† After another long look, he pulled her into his arms for a quick hug. ‚ÄúSo be it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leslie turned to Ani. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs a chaos star and knotwork with these amazing eyes and shadow wings.‚Äù  
  
¬† Ani took one look at Rabbit‚Äîwho nodded‚Äîand then she whistled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stronger than I thought. Wait till Tish hears.‚Äù She left, calling out, ‚ÄúTish? Guess which one Leslie picked.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo shit?‚Äù Tish‚Äôs shriek made Rabbit close his eyes.  
  
¬† Shaking her head, Leslie told Rabbit, ‚ÄúYou realize that you‚Äôre all being √ºber-weird, even for people who live at a tattoo shop.‚Äù  
  
¬† Instead of acknowledging her remark, Rabbit brushed her hair back tenderly like he did with his own sisters‚Äô. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll need a couple days to get the right ink for this one. You can change your mind.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù She felt the unnatural urge to squeal like Tish had. Soon, she‚Äôd have it, the perfect ink. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk price.‚Äù  
  
¬† Niall watched Leslie walk out of Pins and Needles. When she walked through the city, she moved with her shoulders squared, pace steady. It was at odds with the fears he knew hid inside her. Today, though, her confidence seemed almost real.",1,1754661581.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

For background, I visited his country early last year, we met on an app, and then I l visited for the summer and moved here in January.  I want to know if anyone has experience with his type of behavior.  I can't figure out if my boyfriend is just oblivious to how his actions impact me, or if he just doesn't care about me that much.  I thought he might be on the autism spectrum, but he disagrees.

Here are some examples of his actions:

\-Invited me to a restaurant after he was already there.  I told him it would take 20 minutes to get there from work.  I arrive and he's eaten without me and doesn't see why I'm upset, and says that he was hungry.

\-Regularly asks me if I want to get coffee or ice cream or something.  Usually, that sounds fun to me, so I say yes and then he will respond with ""no, just kidding.""

\-Never answers a question directly.  Asks me questions sometimes and then says he doesn't want to answer if I ask the question back.

\-If we ride the metro together, we board together, but he'll usually walk away from me without saying anything or stand far away.

\-Once we went swimming, and I couldn't find him because he got in the pool after changing without trying to find me.  While swimming, he purposefully went in a lane away from me and then got out when he decided he was done swimming without saying anything to me, and I had to chase after him.  

  
Is this normal behavior?  Does anyone else have experience with these types of scenarios?  I don't know how to understand it, and I want to break up with him because his actions make me think he doesn't even like me, but he gets really upset and has cried thinking he's lost me because he knows he's hard to be with.  Does he want to make me break up with him, or is he genuinely clueless?",1,1754661480.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

1mkvw5m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mkvw5m,I was wrong about my Chemex [Update],"Made some adjustments from all of the comments from my post yesterday and it made the Chemex coffee so much better wow. Way less bitterness and burnt taste, more acidity and better flavour profile.

1. Made the grounds even coarser at 26 on my Baratza Encore
2. Changed to 1:15 ratio with less coffee at 30g to 450ml - brew time went down to 3:45
3. Even more thorough soaking of the filter paper
4. Searched online and folded the chemex filter so that you get even folding on each side vs 3:1 folding.
5. People suggested folding the paper on the spout to prevent possible sticking on the spout and that works beautifully as shown on the photo although the filter sits 90‚Äô rotated.

The top comment on my last post was that it was my technique that was the problem not the Chemex, and indeed it was.

That was until I found Tokyo Stories on Steam.

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2251970/Tokyo\_Stories/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2251970/Tokyo_Stories/)

This game has pretty much the vibe I'm looking for, despite it only being in development still right now as I'm typing this. It's not too busy, it's unique in setting and art style, it has that urban setting in Tokyo that I enjoy, and so far the story of it seems really interesting. It's that mellow/calm trance-like sensation that I really enjoy in these kinds of indie games. The music makes it even better too.

&#x200B;

What I want to ask is if there is any game that has this kind of vibe, almost like VA-11 Hall-A with how the writing is. It's those hidden gems that sadly never get enough attention but deserve it, but at the same time, you wish it didn't have much attention because it would ruin the amount of nostalgic value it has. I'm not making much sense here but in all honesty, I'd really like to find a game that has a beautiful void and mellow type vibe that isn't too flashy or all over the place. Just something like.. this. It doesn't have to be the same thing, but if you watch the trailer it might help with what I'm trying to say.

There are probably no other games like this one due to how braindead modern gaming is nowadays, no artistic freedom or expression, just copy and paste and nothing interesting sadly...

I've played VA-11 Hall-a, Night in the Woods, Coffee Talk, Stray, Hot Pot for One, Neo Cab, GRIS, Season, Haven, and other story-driven games that have something like this that I enjoy. ‚≠ê

I don't know if anyone here has seen the show Call of the Night, but that's what atmosphere I'm looking for :)

Sorry for making this post too long, I'm trying my best to explain properly of what I'm looking for from my perspective and hoping it makes sense.. I'm not sure what unique names for these kinds of games are (if there are any..)

One more example to describe the kinds of games I'm trying to look for is from the music I linked below, I hope it helps, I want to try finding some to make this accurate enough. :)

1mkvw0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlsWeekendGetaway/comments/1mkvw0k/3_days_in_santa_barbara_that_felt_like_a_reset/,3 Days in Santa Barbara That Felt Like a Reset Button,"Welcome to *Girls Weekend Getaway*! I wanted to kick things off by sharing one of my favorite solo getaways, a mapped 3-day trip to Santa Barbara that‚Äôs all about wine, beach walks, and easy recharge energy. I encourage you all to post some of your favorite weekend trips or let us know if we can help you plan!

I just got back from a solo trip to Santa Barbara and wanted to share what I did in case anyone else is planning a little beach escape. I‚Äôve been trying to do more short getaways that feel chill and recharging without being boring and Santa Barbara was perfect for that. It‚Äôs walkable, cute, not overwhelming, and has that kind of slow-luxury vibe without needing to do much planning.

Here‚Äôs a quick idea of how I structured my 3 days (I also made a mapped version with all the pins if you want to use it, linked below).

**Day 1:**¬†I stayed at the Hotel Californian which was a little splurge but totally worth it. Right between the Funk Zone and the beach so I could just walk everywhere. I did a little sunset walk to Stearns Wharf, grabbed wine and fish tacos, and just kind of eased into the trip.

**Day 2:**¬†Wine tour day Santa Ynez Valley. Honestly one of the prettiest drives I‚Äôve ever done. It felt safe and relaxed doing it solo since it was a group tour. I came back super zen, grabbed a late lunch at Brophy Bros. by the harbor, and later treated myself to a massage at FLOAT Spa. 10/10 recommend.

**Day 3:**¬†Woke up early and walked Butterfly Beach with coffee in hand, then had brunch at Boathouse (the views!!). Walked around downtown a bit more, stopped at La Arcada Plaza to poke around shops and galleries. I had a few hours to kill before heading out so I just chilled in the Mission Rose Garden with a book. It was the perfect slow sendoff.

A few random tips if you‚Äôre going solo:

* You honestly don‚Äôt need a car if you stay near downtown or the Funk Zone.
* The pace is slow in a good way. No pressure to over-schedule.
* It felt safe the whole time, even walking alone during sunset.
* Lots of chill moments built in spa time, beach, cafes with outdoor seating, wine tasting with new people if you want social energy without committing.

Anyway, I‚Äôve been sharing a few of my solo getaways lately, past and future and I put them into little 3-day mapped guides. They‚Äôre kind of like a shortcut if you want to skip the planning part but still have a stylish, easy trip.

Here‚Äôs the one I made for Santa Barbara if anyone wants it:

1mkvuua,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1mkvuua/drivers_behaving_well/,Drivers behaving well,"My walk today took me westbound along Regent from Park to the bike path.  I saw about 70 to 100 cars driving into the Sun.  Most of the drivers looked pained to be over-illuminated.

Almost every driver was a safe driver.  I would estimate 95% of them were.  Only one driver, a woman, trying apparently to perpetuate the woman driver stereotype, had no hands on the wheel as she manipulated her phone.

I saw no pedestrians trying to cross Regent, but in my experience down there, cars almost always will stop for you. ( I recall seeing a police sting there once, catching drivers who didn't.  That was satisfying.)  Of course,  you must be cautious.

Lots of drivers seemed to be eating.  One woman was picking her nose.

I stopped into Indie for Iced Coffee...Best in the city IMO.

As you might imagine, it's not simple to turn right onto Regent from the south side during the morning ""rush"", but the cars and trucks at Randall and Madison trying to do so yielded to me. I waited til I saw that they saw me, as any aggressive but prudent pedestrian does.

Then I was on the SW path, and people behaved there as expected as well.  Shout out to the West High girls XC team doing some training, and to the bikers who slowed down to get around them.  Also shout out to the biker with a trailer toting a suitcase and a big old box holding another bike, I think.  Or maybe a big flat screen. ü§î

1mkvu99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mkvu99/after_my_smoke_break_time_had_stopped_but/,"After my smoke break, time had stopped. But something was still walking around.","It was an ordinary Wednesday morning. Mid-winter, still well before Christmas, but the office was already deep in its usual off-season lull. Since our company‚Äôs busy period was in spring or early summer, by now only Christmas songs were playing, and our days mostly consisted of goofing off.

Then came 11:25 ‚Äî my usual pre-lunch bathroom and smoke break.

I smoked quickly; it was cold outside, and no one wanted to stand around too long. I was the only one who ducked into the restroom, while the others headed back to their desks to watch stupid videos.

Nothing out of the ordinary happened ‚Äî it was just another simple Wednesday.
Until I stepped out of the restroom.

The coworkers I'd just been smoking with were still standing in the hallway. Dressed in winter coats and hats, one of them was halfway through opening the door ‚Äî frozen mid-motion, as if time itself had paused.

They were just standing there. All of them‚Ä¶ frozen stiff.
At first, I thought they were joking. Maybe they‚Äôd seen some meme and were trying to prank me.
But as I walked closer, it all started to feel weirder. Four of them were standing in the doorway, completely still. None of them even twitched. Nothing.


""What the hell are you guys doing?"" I asked with a half-laugh.


But no one answered. They just stood there, completely still.


""Guys? What are you doing?""


Still nothing.
I reached out and grabbed one of my coworkers by the shoulder, gave him a shake.
It felt like I was trying to move a mannequin.
That‚Äôs when I started to freak out a little. What the hell was wrong with them? Had something happened? Were they sick?

No matter who I spoke to in the hallway, no one reacted. Their faces were frozen, staring blankly ahead ‚Äî like prisoners of the moment.

Panicked, I hurried into the main office. I had to tell someone ‚Äî something was wrong with the others.
But as soon as I pushed open the door to the large open workspace, I froze again.
No one moved. No one spoke. Not a sound.

It felt like I was trapped inside a model room. No one in the office moved ‚Äî everyone was frozen. They stayed in whatever position they were in when time stopped. The monitors were still on, everything kept working as normal‚Ä¶ only my coworkers looked like mannequins.

I rushed into my boss‚Äôs office, hoping maybe he was different. But no ‚Äî same deal.
He sat there, bored expression on his face, leaning on his desk ‚Äî not a single muscle moved. He was completely frozen too.

That‚Äôs when I really started to panic. Only one logical choice remained: get out of here. As fast as possible.


I bolted toward the elevator, nearly knocking over one of the coworkers frozen at the entrance. I jabbed the call button over and over ‚Äî nothing. It was like the button didn‚Äôt even exist. There was power ‚Äî the screen was lit ‚Äî but the elevator didn‚Äôt move.

Alright, plan B: the stairs.

I ran to the stairwell, but the door wouldn‚Äôt open. I yanked on it like a lunatic ‚Äî nothing.
Locked? Or was it broken just like the elevator?
What the hell is wrong with this place? And why am I the only one still moving?

Next idea: the window.
Even if I couldn‚Äôt climb out ‚Äî we were on the seventh floor ‚Äî at least I could try to signal someone. Or... something.

I hurried between the rows of desks. My coworkers were still just sitting there ‚Äî motionless.
Not a single part of them moved. Their frozen eyes stared blankly into nothing.

The window wouldn‚Äôt open either. I pulled and twisted the handle, but it didn‚Äôt budge. It felt like someone had sealed it shut.

I stood there, clutching my head in frustration. The office had never been this quiet, this calm ‚Äî and that only made it more disturbing. I was terrified, and I didn‚Äôt understand a single thing about what was happening.

Outside, the snow had started to fall.


I slumped down into my chair at my desk, hopelessly.
I tried all the company phones ‚Äî nothing but silence. Even my own mobile showed no signal at all.
What the hell happened? I just went out for a smoke and a quick bathroom break, and now it seems like time itself has stopped. And me‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt I freeze like the others? And more importantly: how the hell am I going to get out of here?

That‚Äôs when I heard a loud thud from the far back of the office, somewhere behind me.
I jumped up instantly ‚Äî both excited and terrified. Was someone else here after all? Or maybe the others were starting to wake up?

But no. There was no one there.
Everything and everyone was still exactly where I left them ‚Äî some sitting at their desks, others frozen mid-action by the printer.
Outside, the snow was still falling, and since the clock had slipped to 4 PM, darkness was slowly beginning to creep in.

I should be heading home soon. But I highly doubt I‚Äôm going anywhere today. I just hope help is on the way. Surely, someone will notice when an entire floor of people doesn't show up.

That‚Äôs when I noticed ‚Äî still standing next to my desk ‚Äî that one workstation was empty.
But the monitor was still on. If I remember right, that‚Äôs where Sandra sits. A kind, middle-aged woman. She always brings muffins at Christmas. We had coffee together just this morning. And now ‚Äî she was gone.

Could that thud have been her?

Cautiously, I hurried over to her desk. It was just a few rows down. No sign of Sandra.
Her chair was knocked over, and her cat-themed coffee mug lay on the floor ‚Äî the last bit of her drink spilled out across the tiles.


‚ÄúSandra?‚Äù I called out, loudly, hoping she was still nearby. ‚ÄúWhere are you, Sandra?‚Äù


But no reply came. Just the same graveyard silence as before.
The hum of the machines was the only sound ‚Äî until the fluorescent lights suddenly began to flicker.
And then it happened ‚Äî the thing I‚Äôd feared most. All the lights went out.
Outside, it was nearly pitch black. Massive snowflakes drifted down slowly, almost majestically.
Inside, the office was plunged into near darkness.
The overhead lights were dead, but the monitors still glowed, casting a grotesque, cold light across the quiet room. My coworkers‚Äô frozen bodies looked even more disturbing now, faintly illuminated in that ghostly glow.
It would‚Äôve been better if they were at least working. Or talking. Or if I could hear them breathing. But there was nothing.

Then I heard it ‚Äî The door to the supply closet at the back of the office creaked open.
Every part of me wanted to run. But‚Ä¶ where?

I crept back to my desk.
Of course, I immediately banged my shin on the corner of a table and knocked over a small trash bin in the dark. But at least there‚Ä¶ I felt a little more comfortable.
It was my desk. My spot. 
I stared at the supply closet door. There was only darkness beyond it. No movement. No sound since it had opened.

Maybe it just stayed ajar. Maybe a draft pushed it open.
But the windows didn‚Äôt open either‚Ä¶ So what did?

And then I saw it‚Äî The horror. 


I just stood there, frozen ‚ÄîLike the others around me. But I‚Ä¶ I was still conscious. Still very much awake.

In the corridor between the desks, a strange figure was shuffling toward me. 
It looked like a dried-out corpse: its skin was pure white, clinging tightly to its bones. Its face was sunken, eye sockets dark and hollow. It had no mouth at all.

But its bony arms were so long they reached the floor, ending in huge, knobby fingers.
From its hunched chest, smaller skeletal hands dangled forward ‚Äì reaching, twitching ‚Äì
and these tiny hands moved as if they were playing invisible piano keys in the air, or searching for something unseen.

I couldn‚Äôt move a muscle. I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt throw anything. I didn‚Äôt even try to hide.

I just stood there in my stupid shirt, staring as the monitors‚Äô glow lit up the grotesque figure, inching ever closer to my desk.

It was almost upon me when, with a sudden instinct, I ducked down and crawled under the desk. I don‚Äôt know what drove me. I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was a good hiding spot ‚Äî
but at the time, it felt like the only one I had.

My coworkers‚Äô frozen bodies still sat in place at their desks. It was all absurd ‚Äî at least, as much as I could make out in the dim light.


Then, in the blink of an eye‚Ä¶the creature was right there. Standing at my desk.

I saw its massive, bony feet ‚Äî the nails were like knives. Its body was tall and gaunt ‚Äî so skeletal, it seemed to stretch all the way to the ceiling.

I crouched under my desk, holding my breath.
Damn cables dangled around my neck, and between my bag and the chair, I barely had space to fit.
But the creature didn‚Äôt notice me. It just stood there‚Ä¶ waiting. 
Maybe for me. Maybe for something else.

Then it moved.
Its enormous hand rested on the head of the man who sat behind me ‚Äî Pete.
Pete was the guy in the desk right behind mine. A brown-nosing little machine ‚Äî no one really liked him. But even so‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to see what that thing was about to do to him.
I trembled as I waited to see what would happen.

The monster simply squeezed Pete‚Äôs frozen head‚Ä¶then tipped him out of his chair.
Pete lay on the floor ‚Äî staring at me.

I didn‚Äôt make a sound.

The creature reached down, feeling for Pete‚Äôs body. With its long, skeletal fingers, it grabbed hold of his face ‚Äî and dragged him away.

It turned and headed back the way it had come, shuffling slowly, just as before ‚Äî pulling Pete‚Äôs paralyzed body behind it.

Only one thought flashed through my mind:
I have to get out of here.


I sat trembling beneath my desk, listening as the grotesque creature shuffled across the office carpet.

What the hell was I supposed to do now? There was no way out ‚Äî none of the exits would open.
From under my desk, I could see clearly in the nighttime gloom: outside, snow was falling in heavy sheets.
Had time stopped out there too? Or was life continuing as usual?

Cautiously, I crept out from under the desk ‚Äî just enough to look around.

The creature was now shuffling near the opposite end of the office, far from the supply closet. Pete was no longer being dragged behind it ‚Äî I had no idea where he‚Äôd been left, or what had become of him.

The thing just wandered slowly, and the tiny skeletal hands hanging from its chest were twitching, pawing at the air, as if searching for something.

I couldn‚Äôt stay in the same room with it. It was only a matter of time before it found me.

I had one chance left: sneak into the lobby again ‚Äîtry the elevator or the stairwell door one more time.


The creature was still at the far end of the office. I crawled slowly on all fours, inching my way toward the door.
I made it surprisingly far, right to where my smoking buddies had been frozen.

One of them still held the office door open ‚Äî so I slipped through easily. The lobby was dark too. The elevator wasn‚Äôt even lit.
I rushed to it and jabbed the buttons ‚Äînothing. None of them worked.

Then I turned toward the stairwell door ‚Äî and out of the corner of my eye‚Ä¶ I saw it.

The creature was there. Standing in the doorway ‚Äî at the office entrance, looking out.
It was staring at me with those sunken, empty eyes.
It knew I was there. It wasn‚Äôt shuffling anymore. It ran. Straight at me.

I yanked the door handle, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was locked. This is where I‚Äôm going to die.

But then‚Ä¶ as the creature‚Äôs thundering footsteps shook the floor of the lobby,
I saw it: the light was on in the restroom.

With one desperate leap, I sprinted over, jumped inside, and slammed the door shut behind me. I darted into one of the stalls and locked it tight. The monster smashed through the restroom‚Äôs main door.
I was gasping for breath, crouching in the stall, trying to stay as silent as I could ‚Äî but the thing knew exactly where I was.
It started pounding on the stall door. Its massive hands slammed against the metal,
making the entire room tremble. The door bent inward ‚Äî it looked like it could burst open at any second.

There was nothing else I could do.
I screamed. Screamed from pure fear.
And then‚Ä¶ a familiar voice spoke.


‚ÄúMatt? Matt, are you okay in there?‚Äù


At first, I didn‚Äôt even notice. 
The creature‚Äôs pounding had stopped. The stall door no longer shook. There was silence.
Calm. Familiar. Just like the restroom always used to be.

And then someone spoke again from just outside the stall where I was hiding.


‚ÄúMatt? Is that you in there? What the hell are you doing?‚Äù


I was terrified.
My shirt was soaked with sweat, I was shaking like a leaf. With trembling hands, I opened the stall door. It creaked slowly outward ‚Äî and standing there was a familiar face.
Dave.
My friend. The guy I always went out for a smoke with. The same guy who, just a moment ago, had been frozen in place by the hallway door. Now he was standing there, staring at me with suspicion, holding a coffee mug.

I was crouched on the toilet seat, drenched in sweat, pale as a corpse, and shaking uncontrollably.

Slowly, without saying a word, I climbed down. I stumbled out of the stall, staggering toward the door. Dave didn‚Äôt say anything ‚Äî he just looked at me like I‚Äôd lost my mind.

I staggered back into the office. 
Everyone was back in place. Some were working. Others just chilling. The clock said 4:30 ‚Äî half an hour left until the end of the day.

Dizzy and disoriented, I started looking for the ones the creature had taken.

The chair behind my desk was empty. Pete‚Äôs stuff was gone. No picture of his dog. No stupid motivational calendar.

Dave and a few others stood behind me, staring, confused. What the hell is wrong with me? Suddenly, I spun around like a madman and whispered:


‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Pete?‚Äù


No one answered.
They just looked at each other, puzzled ‚Äî as if they didn‚Äôt even know who I meant.


‚ÄúDave,‚Äù I said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúDave‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs Sandra? Muffin Sandra. You know who I mean.‚Äù


Dave just shook his head.


‚ÄúMatt‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no one named Sandra who works here.‚Äù


I looked around, panic rising in my chest.
What the hell is going on? 

And then one single thought filled my mind.

So my friend basically roasted me the other day. I'm casually mentioning my morning Starbucks run and he goes ""Dude you're literally paying rent for coffee.""

At first I was like ""nah it's just a few bucks"" but then I actually did the math and HOLY S\*\*T. I have been spending like $180 a month on coffee. That's about $2160/year ON COFFEE. I could literally go on a nice vacation with that money!

So anyway, long story short, my friend recommend me to get an **OutIn Nano** and some decent beans. Now I'm making cafe-quality coffee for about $1 per cup instead of $7. The math is insane - went from $180/month to like $30/month and honestly? The coffee now tastes way better !

**I've been doing this for 3 months now and I've already saved $450. The machine is small enough to fit in my backpack, so I can bring it everywhere - work, trips, wherever. No more waiting in line at starbucks, no more ""sorry our machine is broken"", no more overpriced airport coffee that tastes like sadness.**

Best part? My coworkers thought I was weird at first but now like half of them have an **OutIn Nano** too and we're trading coffee beans like we're running some underground coffee cartel, LMAO!

Honestly, I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out. Coffee shops have really gotten us to think that paying $7 for something that costs them 50 cents is totally normal.

Yes, I still go to coffee shops sometimes when I'm meeting friends or whatever; I'm not a complete hermit. I'm just saying, for daily coffee, the portable machine is a game-changer.""

## Key Features Analysis

The key to a great bourbon cream lies in the quality of its ingredients and the skill with which thay are blended. We judged based on several key factors that contribute to the overall experience.

**Bourbon Quality:** The bourbon used is paramount. Look for creams that specify the type of bourbon used (e.g., wheated, high-rye) or mention its age. A higher-quality bourbon will impart smoother, more complex flavors with notes of caramel, vanilla, and oak. A poor-quality bourbon can result in a harsh or artificial taste that overpowers the cream.

**Cream Base:** The cream base should be rich and velvety without being overly heavy or greasy. A good bourbon cream uses real dairy cream instead of artificial substitutes, resulting in a cleaner, more authentic flavor. The cream should seamlessly integrate with the bourbon, creating a harmonious blend.

**Sweetness Level:** Sweetness is subjective, but the best bourbon creams strike a balance, allowing the bourbon's flavors to shine through without being cloyingly sweet. Some use natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, which can add depth and complexity.Excessive sweetness will mask the underlying bourbon character.

**Consistency and Texture:** Ideal bourbon cream has a smooth, silky consistency that coats the palate. It shouldn't be too thick or too thin. The texture should feel luxurious and inviting. Improper blending or inferior ingredients can lead to a grainy or separated texture.**Aromatic Profile:** A good bourbon cream will have an enticing aroma combining the vanilla and caramel notes of bourbon with the fresh, sweet scent of cream.Complex examples might also exhibit hints of spice, chocolate, or nuts. An artificial or muted aroma is a telltale sign of lower quality.

**Finish:** The finish should be long and lingering, leaving a pleasant warmth and sweetness on the palate. Bitterness, off-flavors, or a harsh alcoholic burn are undesirable. The best bourbon creams offer a smooth, satisfying finish that invites another sip.

Key features of top bourbon cream products include:

*  High-quality bourbon base
*  Rich and creamy texture
*  Balanced sweetness
*  Natural ingredients

1mkvmkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mkvmkz/delve_into_whether_the_best_coffee_urn_west_bend/,Delve Into Whether the Best Coffee Urn West Bend 58030 Is Worth It,"The West Bend 58030 coffee urn earned its spot in my kitchen after countless discussions at work about how frustratingly slow brewing setups can ruin the perfect coffee break at an event. Given that I'm often the ""coffee person"" tasked with bringing a reliable brewing solution to gatherings, I decided to put this 30-cup machine to the test. Here‚Äôs exactly how it stacks up in my eyes, after running it almost daily for several weeks.

**Sleek Yet Practical Design**  
The polished aluminum body of this coffee urn immediately caught my attention. It doesn't just look elegant sitting on a counter; it also feels sturdy enough to handle regular use. The handle and stay-cool base are well-thought-out additions, especially if you're like me and tend to shift appliances around in a cramped kitchen or during events. Despite its simple appearance, this machine doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúheavy-duty commercial!‚Äù It fits neatly into both professional and casual settings, which I appreciate for my office potlucks and family reunions alike.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
Brewing coffee at a rate of one cup per minute is a game changer. Hosting large groups often meant using slower coffee machines, which tested everyone‚Äôs patience. But using this machine, I could easily focus on other tasks because it reliably keeps up with demand. The automatic switch to a keep-warm mode after brewing is genius‚Äîcoffee stays at a drinkable temperature without burning, which is something I desperately needed after too many events full of scorched coffee.

**Perks**  
- Polished aluminum construction makes it durable yet attractive.  
- Handles high-volume brewing perfectly without slowing down.  
- Keep-warm mode ensures the coffee is at the perfect temperature for hours.  

[Check West Bend 58030 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b00008iha1/)  

**Ease of Use and Included Features**  
My favorite aspect of the West Bend urn is just how manageable it is to operate. The built-in in-basket measuring guide ensures I get the coffee-to-water ratio right. I never enjoyed guessing proportions, so this feature reduced my headaches significantly. Additionally, the spigot allows a drip-free pour (finally!), which is a godsend for anyone who values table cleanliness or despises sticky messes. Continuous flow from the spigot works wonders when filling larger coffee carafes too. Plus, clean-up is considerably easier than those stubborn coffee makers that require gentle scrubbing in awkward spots‚Äîthis unit simplifies the process thanks to its lightweight build despite brewing for large groups.

**Limitations**  
While the West Bend urn excels in many areas, I have to admit to finding a few small concerns.  
- Not suitable for heavy-duty, commercial-grade use, so it‚Äôs best kept for smaller events or personal gatherings.  
- No auto-shutoff feature if unplugged or left on for long hours (a minor handful for absent-minded folks like me).  

**Target Demographics**  
This coffee urn is perfect for those handling casual events or gatherings involving medium-sized crowds. In my case, it‚Äôs become a lifesaver during office coffee runs, church functions, and holiday dinners. However, if you‚Äôre running a caf√© or need a solution for large-scale events, I‚Äôd look for a commercial-grade option as this model is rated for light-duty use.

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to similar coffee urns like Presto and Hamilton Beach, the West Bend stands out with its polished finish and user-friendly brewing simplicity. The Presto model offers a comparable capacity but lacks the subtle aesthetic appeal this urn brings to the table. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach coffee urns offer programmable features but seem bulkier and harder to clean based on what my colleagues have shared with me. Translation: For style, portability, and practicality, the West Bend holds firm ground for personal and event use.

**Affordable Quality**  
Quality for price is ultimately what sells this coffee urn for me. It's genuinely affordable when measured up against other coffee urns, especially considering the consistent performance and the thoughtful design touches like the no-drip spigot. For the price range it falls into, you're definitely getting more than basic functionality‚Äîyou're getting reliability, ease, and a touch of elegance.

1mkvmbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1mkvmbn/do_you_personalize_linkedin_connection_requests/,Do you personalize LinkedIn connection requests or leave them blank? [N/A],"I was chatting with a recruiter friend over coffee and we ended up debating something that I think a few of us do without really thinking about, whether to personalize LinkedIn connection requests or not. 

I've been on LinkedIn forever but have never tracked which actually works better. 

She‚Äôs been experimenting with a tool called Klevere AI that uses AI to go to LinkedIn profiles, looks at recent posts, job experience etc and drafts really personalized intros based on the person‚Äôs profile.

 It saves her time but still makes each message feel relevant. She swears her acceptance rate is higher when she personalizes.

On the flip side, I‚Äôve heard from others who leave the request blank and still get solid acceptance rates. Does it depend more on the relevance/seniority of your profile? I think so. 

I mean if someone was more junior, had a profile that perhaps would not add the most value to my network and wanted to connect with me, if it was really personalized, I'd accept as I feel effort was put in. If I feel their profile probably won't add value to my network and the request is blank, I generally won't accept. 

Do you guys feel the same? Do you add a personalized message or leave it blank? I suppose the generic ""I'd like to add you to my professional network"" has been done to death. I feel that hardly works. ",1,1754660690.0,humanresources,3,1.0,False

Okay ‚Äî deep breath ‚Äî here‚Äôs the wildest part: I thought these ‚Äúget paid to test apps‚Äù deals were all scams, but nope. I literally tried some, and my coffee funds have never been so *robust.*

So, here‚Äôs my list of the Top 7 *LEGIT* apps (yes, really paying in 2025!) that blew my mind ‚Äî and my bank balance:

‚Ä¢ **GoodNovel TestLab** (yes, the *real* one)  
  I‚Äôve been SHOCKED. Test the latest wild reading features or voting on the next plot twists, and they pay you for *every* test. You just join on the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** page, give your review, and it‚Äôs instant payout! Uh, where has this been my whole life?? Did everyone else know before me???  
  (Note: they send new beta invites every week, and already paid me twice! **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**)

‚Ä¢ TryItFirst  
  I signed up assuming I‚Äôd maybe get a product test after six years of waiting. NOPE. Within an hour, they matched me to a beta test for a budget AI shopping assistant. $25 for ten minutes?! How, who, why??  

‚Ä¢ AppFeedback+  
  I SWEAR these guys are watching me get excited, because their surveys are all fresh, and you literally HAVE to use the feature before getting paid. Screenshots or it didn‚Äôt happen! Payments‚Ä¶ IMMEDIATE!!  

‚Ä¢ **GoodNovel TestLab** again because I could literally not believe the earnings. I mean, is publishing really this desperate for test users? All I do is click stories, give my best sarcastic feedback, and the payout is sitting there on the dashboard‚Ä¶ just go on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and see it for yourself.  

‚Ä¢ PreviewPerks  
  This one was a curveball. You join, review new menu layouts, and boom - Amazon money. I tried it half-asleep and still got accepted.

‚Ä¢ NewBetaPay  
  It‚Äôs an invite-only beta playground, but if you get in, the pay-per-feature is crazy. Some folks are getting $50 per feature ‚Äî ARE YOU SEEING THIS?!  
 
‚Ä¢ (You guessed it) ‚Äî ran GoodNovel on my mom‚Äôs phone AGAIN and got more bonus coins for coffee! The legitness is UNREAL. Are devs giving cash out for good karma? No idea. **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
   
If you‚Äôre like me (half skeptical, half broke, 100% curious), seriously, check any of the above, especially **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. I genuinely think we‚Äôre living in an era where side hustles are EASIER than ever ‚Äî just test the flashy new bits everyone else ignores, and the apps literally pay *you*.

Has anyone else been cashing in like this? Or am I stuck in a simulation where companies pay for fun?

* ¬†**Museums & History:**¬†Immerse yourself in art and history at Jacksonville‚Äôs excellent museums.

The Beaches area is party central on weekends, the strip of bars in Jacksonville Beach (around 1st Street) fills up with a fun-loving crowd bar-hopping in flip-flops. For a more eclectic night, check out¬†**Five Points in Riverside**, where you‚Äôll find craft cocktail lounges, a retro arcade bar (yes, you can play skee-ball with a beer in hand), and even the city‚Äôs secret speakeasies tucked behind unmarked doors. No matter your style, be it sipping a local IPA at a chill brewery or club-hopping until 2 AM; Jacksonville‚Äôs nightlife won‚Äôt disappoint. The city‚Äôs youthful energy really shines after dark.

At the oceanfront,¬†**Springing the Blues**¬†turns Jacksonville Beach into a massive beachside blues concert each April; feel the sand between your toes as you jam to talented bands. In late summer, the¬†**Jacksonville Caribbean Carnival**¬†brings a burst of color, culture, and calypso to town with costumed parades and island music. Fall is festival season too, with events like¬†**Jax River City Pride**¬†celebrating LGBTQ+ pride with parades and parties, and the eclectic¬†**PorchFest**¬†in Historic Springfield, where musicians perform on front porches for the community. From food truck festivals to art fairs, there‚Äôs¬†**always an event in Jacksonville**¬†to look forward to. 
* ¬†**Sports & Spectacles:**¬†Sports are a big deal here, and even if you‚Äôre not a die-hard fan, the festivities around them are worth experiencing. The annual¬†**Florida‚ÄìGeorgia Football Classic**¬†(a legendary college rivalry game between the University of Florida and University of Georgia) descends on Jacksonville every autumn, turning the whole city into one huge tailgate party. Downtown parking lots fill with BBQ grills and team flags as fans enjoy what many call¬†**the best tailgating in the NFL**¬†when the Jaguars play or college rivals meet. Speaking of the¬†**Jacksonville Jaguars**, catching an NFL game at TIAA Bank Field (soon to be renamed EverBank Stadium again) is a blast; keep an eye out for the¬†*two*¬†live mascots (jaguars) and the stadium‚Äôs unique pool cabanas! Jacksonville also hosts the annual¬†**TaxSlayer Gator Bowl**¬†in late December and welcomes elite golfers each spring at THE PLAYERS Championship in nearby Ponte Vedra. From minor-league baseball games to the Gate River Run (the nation‚Äôs biggest 15K race), there‚Äôs no shortage of athletic excitement. 
* ¬†**Seasonal & Holiday Events:**¬†The fun doesn‚Äôt slow down for the seasons; in fact, each time of year brings its own signature events. In spring, locals celebrate the¬†**Opening of the Beaches**¬†with a festive parade and sandcastle contests to officially kick off beach season. Summer means Fourth of July fireworks over the St. Johns River and the ocean. Jacksonville puts on¬†**free spectacular firework shows downtown and at the beach**¬†that light up the night sky. Fall brings pumpkin patches and the¬†**Spooktacular Halloween festival at the Jacksonville Zoo**, a not-so-scary celebration that‚Äôs perfect for families. As the year wraps up, Jacksonville goes all out for the holidays: the Downtown¬†**Light Boat Parade**¬†at Thanksgiving features dozens of boats decked in twinkling lights cruising the river, and the beach community of Jax Beach displays whimsical lighted sculptures during¬†**Deck the Chairs**, where lifeguard chairs get a merry makeover. No matter the season, Jacksonville loves to throw a good party! 

# Jacksonville Through the Seasons

One of the best things about Jax is that it‚Äôs truly a¬†**year-round city**.¬†There‚Äôs always something happening, and the weather (mostly) cooperates. Here‚Äôs a quick look at Jacksonville activities by season, so you can make the most of every time of year:

# Spring (March ‚Äì May)

Spring in Jacksonville is gorgeous. Mild temperatures (70s and low 80s) and low humidity make it perfect for outdoor fun. This is¬†**festival season**, kicking off with big events like the Jazz Festival downtown and Springing the Blues at the beach. Azaleas and wildflowers bloom across local parks, it‚Äôs a great time for a hike in the Timucuan Preserve or a picnic in Riverside Park under the oak trees. Sports fans have plenty to cheer for: the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (the city‚Äôs minor league baseball team) start their season, and college basketball fans flock to watch March Madness games when hosted here. Don‚Äôt forget to hit the¬†**Riverside Arts Market**¬†on Saturdays; in spring, it‚Äôs buzzing with fresh produce and local art, and you can often catch live music floating through the breezy air. Spring is all about new beginnings in Jax; and new adventures too.

# Summer (June ‚Äì August)

When summer arrives, Jacksonville turns into a¬†**water wonderland**. It does get hot (90¬∞F days are common), but that‚Äôs all the more reason to embrace the water activities. Spend your weekends cooling off at the beach. Mornings surfing or paddleboarding, afternoons swimming and sunbathing. Summer also brings some of the year‚Äôs biggest events. On July 4th, Jacksonville hosts spectacular fireworks downtown over the river and at the Jacksonville Beach Pier, drawing crowds for a dazzling patriotic show. Anglers won‚Äôt want to miss the¬†**Greater Jacksonville Kingfish Tournament**¬†each July; the nation‚Äôs largest kingfish fishing tournament that turns the Intracoastal Waterway into a sea of boats. By August, football fever is ramping up. The NFL‚Äôs Jaguars kick off preseason, and the city‚Äôs ready to¬†**‚Äú#DUUUVAL!‚Äù**¬†at home games. The tailgating is top-notch, so fire up the grill and join the party. Pro tip: summer nights often bring free outdoor concerts at venues like the Seawalk Pavilion or riverside parks, where you can enjoy music under the stars. Yes it‚Äôs warm out there, but summer in Jax is sizzling in the best way.

# Fall (September ‚Äì November)

Ask any local, and they‚Äôll tell you¬†**fall is one of the best times in Jacksonville**. The heat eases up, but the days are still sunny and pleasant. It‚Äôs a perfect season for sports and outdoor festivals. The Jaguars‚Äô regular season is in full swing, so every Sunday the city turns teal with team pride. In late October, the legendary¬†**Florida-Georgia college football game**¬†takes over; even if you don‚Äôt attend the game, the downtown energy with tens of thousands of fans (many who‚Äôve been tailgating for days!) is a spectacle in itself. Fall is also when some beloved festivals return: Oktoberfest events pop up around town, including the big¬†**Beaches Oktoberfest**¬†with bratwurst, beer, and live music at the oceanfront. October brings¬†**spooky fun**;¬†families love Zoo Spooktacular and the creative Halloween events, while artsy folks hit up the Northside‚Äôs Pumpkin Patch art festival or Haunted Brewery tours. As the holiday season nears, November offers treats like¬†**Kids Free November**, when many attractions let children in free all month (perfect for family outings). The weather in fall is arguably ideal. Plenty of sunshine, cooler evenings; so take advantage by dining outside at cafes, exploring weekend farmers markets, and maybe doing a little early holiday shopping at craft fairs.

# Winter (December ‚Äì February)

Winter in Jacksonville is a relative term, there‚Äôs no snow, and you‚Äôll get many days in the 60s or 70s¬∞F. In fact, it‚Äôs a fantastic season to enjoy the outdoors without breaking a sweat. The city dons its holiday spirit in December. Don‚Äôt miss the sparkling¬†**Jacksonville Light Boat Parade**¬†on the river Thanksgiving weekend, where boats big and small compete with extravagant light displays. At Jacksonville Beach, the annual¬†**Deck the Chairs**¬†display turns lifeguard chairs into artful holiday-light sculptures; an only-in-Jax tradition that‚Äôs pure magic at night. Winter is also a great time to visit the parks and do some hiking or biking since the weather is cool and bugs are minimal. Sports-wise, college football fans flock to the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl around New Year‚Äôs, and runners take on the¬†**Gate River Run**¬†15K in early spring (training for it during winter months). Culturally, winter is high season for the arts; the symphony and theaters have full schedules, and you can catch touring Broadway shows in town to escape the occasional chilly evening. By February, the camellias are blooming in places like the Cummer Gardens, hinting that spring is on its way again. Winter in Jacksonville is brief and mild, but oh-so-enjoyable. It‚Äôs the time to experience the city‚Äôs cozy side, from craft coffee shops to twinkling nights on the town.

¬†

Jacksonville truly offers the best of all worlds;¬†**sunny beaches, vibrant arts, delicious food, and a tight-knit community spirit**. Every day can bring a new adventure, whether you‚Äôre paddleboarding at sunrise or dancing in a rooftop bar after dark. It‚Äôs this mix of outdoor beauty and urban energy that makes Jax special. So grab your friends (and maybe a surfboard or a fork!), and start exploring these Jacksonville FL activities for yourself. You‚Äôll quickly see why locals are proud to call this city home. From winter to summer, weekday to weekend, there‚Äôs always another experience waiting just around the corner. Enjoy everything Jacksonville has to offer; we promise you won‚Äôt run out of things to do in this Bold City by the river!",1,1754660443.0,u_jaxhumor,0,1.0,False
1mkvhzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1mkvhzh/delve_into_best_wireless_headset_features_with/,Delve Into Best Wireless Headset Features with Jabra Evolve2 75,"Testing out the Jabra 27599-989-899 turned into a rather fascinating journey as I explored its features on a daily basis for both work and leisure. When I first got my hands on this wireless headset, the premium feel of the leatherette headband and the smooth ear cups immediately stood out. Its design felt thoughtful, particularly with the pressure-reduced ear cups offering some of the best ventilation I‚Äôve experienced in headphones. As someone who wears headsets for hours on end, my ears have never been this grateful.

**Comfort and Style**  
Sliding the headset on, the dual-foam technology honestly proved to be a game-changer. Unlike many headsets that start to feel like a clamp after extended use, the Jabra proved it was built for long-haul sessions. It was reassuring to know that despite its soft materials and lightweight build at just 6.9 ounces, durability didn‚Äôt take a backseat. The sleek black design and minimalist feel looked professional whether I used it in a bustling office or a casual remote setting.

**Audio Quality**  
Audio delivery on this device is stunning. Two powerful 40 mm speakers ensured that my music sessions had rich bass without muddling the mids or highs. Calls also had immaculate clarity, which was a noticeable improvement from the cheaper headsets I‚Äôve tried before. During meetings, the eight integrated microphones worked overtime, ensuring my voice was clear to the other side. The headset‚Äôs noise isolation helped eliminate that awkward ‚ÄúCan you repeat that?‚Äù moment during noisy office calls.

[Check Jabra 27599-989-899 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b09jzqkjk3/)

**Boosted Productivity with Active Noise Cancellation**  
One standout feature I absolutely love is the adjustable Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Whether I was in a caffeinated chaos of coffee-shop vibes or in an office setting where conversations fly across the room, ANC allowed me to tune everything out, leaving only the meeting or music in my ears. But I didn‚Äôt always want to block the world out. With the HearThrough button, I could blend my surroundings beautifully without the need to remove the headset altogether, making it practical while multitasking at work.

**Battery Stamina for the Modern Worker**  
Frequent charging is a personal pet peeve with wireless devices, but this headset delivered 36 hours of battery life which honestly saved me a lot of headache throughout long days. I even tried to drain the battery deliberately, but then the quick 15-minute charge meant I still pulled an additional four hours of use. Major win for anyone juggling back-to-back calls followed by late gaming or binge-watching sessions.

**Advantages**  
- Dual-foam ear cups are incredibly comfortable for prolonged wear.  
- Seamless integration with laptops and phones via the included USB-C Bluetooth adapter.  
- Eight microphones significantly boost call clarity in noisy environments.  
- ANC and HearThrough functions provide user flexibility to control background sounds.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Over-ear design might not suit folks who prefer lighter on-ear headsets.  
- Price point might feel steep compared to competitors like Audio-Technica or Sony in similar categories.  
- Limited color options‚Äîblack may not cater to individuals craving vibrant choices.  

**Competing Products**  
While the Jabra shines in features like ANC, battery performance, and mic quality, it has tough competition. Sony‚Äôs WH-1000XM5, for instance, leans heavy on audio finesse with a more immersive soundstage. That said, Sony‚Äôs design doesn‚Äôt quite match the lightweight comfort Jabra nails effortlessly. On the other hand, Bose QuietComfort 45 rivals it closely in ANC effectiveness but falls slightly short in multitasking flexibility across different devices. Jabra‚Äôs Bluetooth range of 30 meters also squeezes out a small victory over its peers.

**Price Performance**  
Balancing cost against its features, the headset offers fantastic value and practicality, especially for professionals spending long hours on calls or tight deadlines. Sure, it‚Äôs not budget-tier, but every now and then, a splurge on quality tools proves worthwhile. For users working remotely or in hybrid offices, its seamless integration with popular communication platforms like Microsoft Teams and Zoom ensures smooth operations without glitches. You‚Äôre paying for equipment that delivers.

As someone who drinks at least three cups of tea daily, having a kettle that balances speed, safety, and design in one package is a game changer. Still, no product is flawless, and this one has both upsides and areas worth noting. Let's dive into it. 

**Rapid Boiling: A Game-Changer**  
If there's one thing that stands out, it's how incredibly fast this electric kettle boils. Imagine this: you fill up its 1.8L capacity, and seven-ish minutes later, you've got steaming hot water ready for tea, coffee, or even instant noodles. I timed it out of curiosity, and it definitely delivered on its ""rapid boiling"" promise. For a busy morning rush or those moments when you just can‚Äôt wait for your caffeine dose, this feature hits the mark without fail.  

[Check AZEUS CX-817 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07yc2csby/)  

**Materials That Matter**  
The kettle is constructed with **304 stainless steel** and **borosilicate glass**, making it not only durable but also BPA-free. As someone really conscious about what materials come into contact with my food and drinks, this gave me peace of mind. There‚Äôs no funky ‚Äúplastic-like‚Äù taste in the water, a problem I‚Äôve run into with cheaper kettles. Even after frequent use every single day for over a month, the materials haven‚Äôt shown any signs of wear or tear.  

**Safety Features You‚Äôll Appreciate**  
One thing that quickly struck me about this kettle was its safety-first approach. The **auto shut-off** and **boil-dry protection** features are not just nice to have‚Äîthey‚Äôre lifesavers. I‚Äôve left it on once or twice (thanks, distracted brain), but the auto-shut-off kicked in and saved me from a potential disaster. It gives me peace of mind that even my forgetful tendencies won‚Äôt end in disaster.  

**Looks That Impress**  
Let‚Äôs not ignore how good this kettle looks sitting on my countertop. There‚Äôs a blue LED light that comes on when it‚Äôs boiling‚Äîa small touch, but it adds an aesthetic flair. The **360-degree swivel base** paired with its compact design ensures it doesn‚Äôt take up much space, which is perfect for smaller kitchens. Cleaning is just as effortless. Thanks to its wide opening, I never struggled to reach the awkward corners while scrubbing it clean after a hectic week.  

**Winning Points**  
‚Ä¢ Boils 1.8L of water faster than many competitors.  
‚Ä¢ High-quality, BPA-free stainless steel and glass construction.  
‚Ä¢ Easily portable and compact for small spaces.  
‚Ä¢ Safety features like auto-shutoff provide peace of mind.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
As much as I love this kettle, no product is without drawbacks. For example, it does get hot to the touch, especially near the stainless steel parts. If there are kids in the house, you‚Äôd want to ensure they don‚Äôt accidentally touch the kettle after use.  

‚Ä¢ Exterior gets hot during use.  
‚Ä¢ Cable length (40 inches) may feel short for certain kitchens.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other kettles like the **Hamilton Beach Glass Electric Kettle** or the **Cuisinart JK-17**, the AZEUS model excels in both speed and safety features. The Hamilton Beach kettle is also a solid contender featuring similar borosilicate glass construction but takes slightly longer to boil comparable quantities of water. Cuisinart‚Äôs JK-17 offers adjustable temperature settings, which is excellent for tea enthusiasts who want precision, though it falls short when it comes to energy savings. What sets the AZEUS apart is its affordability while still delivering solid performance and safety‚Äîa win in my book.  

**Cost Effectiveness**  
When viewed through the lens of cost compared to functionality, this electric kettle offers excellent **value for money**. Many kettles in this price range lack the combination of premium materials, rapid boiling, and safety features that this model offers. Sure, some premium brands come with customizable temperature options, but for the average user who simply needs efficiently boiled water every day, this kettle is a fantastic investment.

1mkvgfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/saunamarketplace/comments/1mkvgfi/what_to_drink_if_you_sauna_every_day/,What to Drink If You Sauna Every Day,"At Sauna Marketplace, we think a lot about the conditions inside a sauna that make you feel better and more energized when you leave. If you feel like you‚Äôre *enduring* the heat, it‚Äôs probably not the right sauna ‚Äî the best ones give you energy.  

Inside the sauna, it's all about heat distribution, CO2, and Oxygen.  Outside the sauna, it's all about hydration.  

That post-sauna high doesn‚Äôt happen by accident. Daily sweating drains your body of water **and** electrolytes. Skip replenishment and your ‚Äúahhh‚Äù turns into ‚Äúugh.‚Äù Let‚Äôs make sure your sauna habit keeps you feeling amazing, not wiped out.

# Why Hydration Matters More Than You Think

A 20-minute sauna can make you lose about a pint (0.5 L) of sweat along with sodium, potassium, magnesium, and more. Water alone won‚Äôt replace these minerals, and without them you risk cramps, headaches, and fatigue. Proper recovery means restoring both **fluid and electrolytes** right away so you can avoid negative effects and sauna again tomorrow feeling great.

# The Best Drinks for Sauna Recovery

üíß **Mineral Water** ‚Äì Foundation of rehydration. Save ultra-purified or distilled water for loyly, these dilute electrolytes. Go for natural mineral water or tap water. Aim for 2‚Äì4 glasses after your session.

‚ö° **Electrolyte Drinks** ‚Äì Replace sodium (biggest sweat loss), plus potassium and magnesium. Look for clean options like LMNT, Nuun, or Liquid I.V., or make your own with water, citrus, and sea salt. Electrolytes help your body hold onto water and recover faster.

ü•• **Coconut Water** ‚Äì Nature‚Äôs sports drink. High in potassium, with magnesium and sodium too. Choose 100% pure, no-sugar-added. One carton (11‚Äì16 oz) is plenty for most.

üçµ **Herbal Tea** ‚Äì Caffeine-free peppermint, chamomile, rooibos, or hibiscus rehydrate gently and add calming or cooling effects. Great warm or iced. Skip coffee and alcohol right after ‚Äî both dehydrate.

üç≤ **Broths & Miso Soup** ‚Äì Warm, salty, and packed with sodium to lock in hydration. Easy on the stomach if you‚Äôre not ready for solid food.

ü•§ **Smoothies** ‚Äì Hydrate and refuel at once. Blend high-water fruits (watermelon, pineapple, cucumber) with coconut water or almond milk, add a pinch of salt, and you‚Äôve got a cool, mineral-rich recovery shake.

# Timing Is Everything

* **Before**: Drink 1‚Äì2 glasses of water (add salt if you‚Äôve been sweating earlier in the day).
* **During**: Sip water for long or back-to-back rounds.
* **After**: In the first 30 minutes, drink at least 16‚Äì20 oz ‚Äî ideally with electrolytes.
* **All Day**: Keep sipping to fully restore hydration; aim for light-colored urine.
* **Avoid**: Alcohol, caffeine, and heavy, sugary drinks until rehydrated.

# Pro Tips for Daily Sauna Users

* Electrolytes aren‚Äôt just for athletes, if you sauna daily, make them part of your ritual.
* Coconut water or a salty broth can rehydrate better than plain water alone.
* Trace mineral drops are an easy way to boost any drink.
* Listen to your body: cramps, dizziness, or fatigue mean you need more fluids and salts.

**Bottom line:** The sauna is the easy part. The magic happens when you *also* replace what you‚Äôve lost. Replenish right, and every session will leave you stronger, clearer, and ready for the next round.",1,1754660288.0,saunamarketplace,0,1.0,False

¬† Everything had gone horribly wrong.  
  
¬† None of Safiya fon Hasstrel‚Äôs hastily laid plans for this holdup were unfolding as they ought.  
  
¬† First, the black carriage with the gleaming gold standard was not the target Safi and Iseult had been waiting for. Worse, this cursed carriage was accompanied by eight rows of city guards blinking midday sun from their eyes.  
  
¬† Second, there was absolutely nowhere for Safi and Iseult to go. Up on their limestone outcropping, the dusty road below was the only path to Ve√±aza City. And just as this thrust of gray rock overlooked the road, the road overlooked nothing but turquoise sea forever. It was seventy feet of cliff pounded by rough waves and even rougher winds.  
  
¬† And third‚Äîthe real kick in the kidneys‚Äîwas that as soon as the guards marched over the girls‚Äô buried trap and the firepots within exploded ‚Ä¶ Well, then those guards would be scouring every inch of the cliffside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHell-gates, Iz.‚Äù Safi snapped down her spyglass. ‚ÄúThere are four guards in each row. Eight times four makes‚Ä¶‚Äù Her face scrunched up. Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs thirty-two,‚Äù Iseult said blandly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThirty-two thrice-damned guards with thirty-two thrice-damned crossbows.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult only nodded and eased back the hood of her brown cape. The sun lit up her face. She was the perfect contrast to Safi: midnight hair to Safi‚Äôs wheat, moon skin to Safi‚Äôs tan, and hazel eyes to Safi‚Äôs blue.  
  
¬† Hazel eyes that were now sliding to Safi as Iseult plucked away the spyglass. ‚ÄúI hate to say ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚Äîbut,‚Äù Iseult finished, ‚ÄúEverything he said to you last night was a lie. He was most certainly not interested in a simple card game.‚Äù Iseult ticked off two gloved fingers. ‚ÄúHe was not leaving town this morning by the northern highway. And I bet‚Äù‚Äîa third finger unfurled‚Äî‚Äúhis name wasn‚Äôt even Caden.‚Äù  
  
¬† Caden. If ‚Ä¶ no, when Safi found that Chiseled Cheater, she was going to break every bone in his perfect rutting face.  
  
¬† Safi groaned and banged her head against the rock. She‚Äôd lost all of her money to him. Not just some, but all.  
  
¬† Last night had hardly been the first time Safi had bet all of her‚Äîand Iseult‚Äôs‚Äîsavings on a card game. It wasn‚Äôt as if she ever lost, for, as the saying went, You can‚Äôt trick a Truthwitch.  
  
¬† Plus, the winnings off one round alone from the highest-stake taro game in Ve√±aza City would have bought Safi and Iseult a place of their own. No more living in an attic for Iseult, no more stuffy Guildmaster‚Äôs guest room for Safi.  
  
¬† But as Lady Fate would have it, Iseult hadn‚Äôt been able to join Safi at the game‚Äîher heritage had banned her from the highbrow inn where the game had taken place. And without her Threadsister beside her, Safi was prone to ‚Ä¶ mistakes.  
  
¬† Particularly mistakes of the strong-jawed, snide-tongued variety who plied Safi with compliments that somehow slipped right past her Truthwitchery. In fact, she hadn‚Äôt sensed a lying bone in Chiseled Cheater‚Äôs body when she‚Äôd collected her winnings from the in-house bank ‚Ä¶ Or when Chiseled Cheater had hooked his arm in hers and guided her into the warm night ‚Ä¶ Or when he‚Äôd leaned in for a chaste yet wildly heady kiss on the cheek.  
  
¬† I will never gamble again, she swore, her heel drumming on the limestone. And I will never flirt again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to run for it,‚Äù Iseult said, interrupting Safi‚Äôs thoughts, ‚Äúthen we need to do so before the guards reach our trap.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say.‚Äù Safi glared at her Threadsister, who watched the incoming guards through the spyglass. Wind kicked at Iseult‚Äôs dark hair, lifting the wispy bits that had fallen from her braid. A distant gull cried its obnoxious scree, scr-scree, scr-scree!  
  
¬† Safi hated gulls; they always shit on her head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMore guards,‚Äù Iseult murmured, the waves almost drowning out her words. But then louder, she said, ‚ÄúTwenty more guards coming from the north.‚Äù  
  
¬† For half a moment, Safi‚Äôs breath choked off. Now, even if she and Iseult could somehow face the thirty-two guards accompanying the carriage, the other twenty guards would be upon them before they could escape.  
  
¬† Safi‚Äôs lungs burst back to life with a vengeance. Every curse she‚Äôd ever learned rolled off her tongue.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre down to two options,‚Äù Iseult cut in, scooting back to Safi‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúWe either turn ourselves in‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOver my grandmother‚Äôs rotting corpse,‚Äù Safi spat.  
  
¬† ‚Äú‚Äîor we try to reach the guards before they trigger the trap. Then all we have to do is brazen our way through.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi glanced at Iseult. As always, her Threadsister‚Äôs face was impassive. Blank. The only part of her that showed stress was her long nose‚Äîit twitched every few seconds.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôre through,‚Äù Iseult added, drawing her hood back into place and casting her face in darkness, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll follow the usual plan. Now hurry.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi didn‚Äôt need to be told to hurry‚Äîobviously she would hurry‚Äîbut she bit back her retort. Iseult was, yet again, saving their hides.  
  
¬† Besides, if Safi had to hear one more I told you so, she‚Äôd throttle her Threadsister and leave her carcass to the hermit crabs.  
  
¬† Iseult‚Äôs feet hit the gritty road, and as Safi descended nimbly beside her, dust plumed around her boots‚Äîand inspiration struck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait, Iz.‚Äù In a flurry of movement, Safi swung off her cape. Then with a quick slash-rip-slash of her parrying knife, she cut off the hood. ‚ÄúSkirt and kerchief. We‚Äôll be less threatening as peasants.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult‚Äôs eyes narrowed. Then she dropped to the road. ‚ÄúBut then our faces will be more obvious. Rub on as much dirt as you can.‚Äù As Iseult scrubbed her face, turning it a muddy brown, Safi wound the hood over her hair and wrapped the cape around her waist. Once she‚Äôd tucked the brown cloak into her belt, careful to hide her scabbards beneath, she too slathered dirt and mud over her cheeks.  
  
¬† In less than a minute, both girls were ready. Safi ran a quick, scrutinizing eye over Iseult ‚Ä¶ but the disguise was good. Good enough. Her Threadsister looked like a peasant in desperate need of a bath.  
  
¬† With Iseult just behind, Safi launched into a quick clip around the limestone corner, her breath held tight ‚Ä¶ Then she exhaled sharply, her pace never slowing. The guards were still thirty paces from the buried firepots.  
  
¬† Safi flashed a bumbling wave at a mustached guard in the front. He lifted his hand, and the other guards came to an abrupt stop. Then, one by one, each guard‚Äôs crossbow leveled on the girls.  
  
¬† Safi pretended not to notice, and when she reached the pile of gray pebbles that marked the trap, she cleared it with the slightest hop. Behind her, Iseult made the same, alm  
ost imperceptible leap.  
  
¬† Then the mustached man‚Äîclearly the leader‚Äîraised his own crossbow. ‚ÄúHalt.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi complied, letting her feet drag to a stop‚Äîwhile also covering as much ground as she could. ‚ÄúOnga?‚Äù she asked, the Arithuanian word for yes. After all, if they were going to be peasants, they might as well be immigrant peasants.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you speak Dalmotti?‚Äù the leader asked, looking first at Safi. Then at Iseult.  
  
¬† Iseult came to a clumsy stop beside Safiya. ‚ÄúWe spwik. A litttttle.‚Äù It was easily the worst attempt at an Arithuanian accent that Safiya had ever heard from Iseult‚Äôs mouth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe are ‚Ä¶ in trouble?‚Äù Safi lifted her hands in a universally submissive gesture. ‚ÄúWe only go to Ve√±aza City.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult gave a dramatic cough, and Safi wanted to throttle her. No wonder Iz was always the cutpurse and Safi the distraction. Her Threadsister was awful at acting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe want a city healer,‚Äù Safi rushed to say before Iseult could muster another unbelievable cough. ‚ÄúIn case she has the plague. Our mother died from it, you see, and ohhhh, how she coughed in those final days. There was so much blood‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlague?‚Äù the guard interrupted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù Safi nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúMy sister is very ill.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult heaved another cough‚Äîbut this one was so convincing, Safi actually flinched ‚Ä¶ and then hobbled to her. ‚ÄúOh, you need a healer. Come, come. Let your sister help you.‚Äù  
  
¬† The guard turned back to his men, already dismissing the girls, already bellowing orders: ‚ÄúBack in formation! Resume march!‚Äù  
  
¬† Gravel crunched; footsteps drummed. The girls trudged onward, passing guards with wrinkled noses. No one wanted Iseult‚Äôs ‚Äúplague‚Äù it would seem.  
  
¬† Safi was just towing Iseult past the black carriage when its door popped wide. A saggy old man leaned his scarlet-clad torso outside. His wrinkles shook in the wind.  
  
¬† It was the leader of the Gold Guild, a man named Yotiluzzi, whom Safi had seen from afar‚Äîat last night‚Äôs establishment, no less.  
  
¬† The old Guildmaster clearly didn‚Äôt recognize Safi, though, and after a cursory glance, he lifted his reedy voice. ‚ÄúAeduan! Get this foreign filth away from me!‚Äù  
  
¬† A figure in white stalked around the carriage‚Äôs back wheel. His cape billowed, and though a hood shaded his face, there was no hiding the knife baldric across his chest or the sword at his waist.  
  
¬† He was a Carawen monk‚Äîa mercenary trained to kill since childhood.  
  
¬† Safi froze, and without thinking, she eased her arm away from Iseult, who twisted silently behind her. The guards would reach the girls‚Äô trap at any moment, and this was their ready position: Initiate. Complete.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúArithuanians,‚Äù the monk said. His voice was rough, but not with age‚Äîwith underuse. ‚ÄúFrom what village?‚Äù He strolled a single step toward Safi.  
  
¬† She had to fight the urge not to cower back. Her Truthwitchery was suddenly bursting with discomfort‚Äîa grating sensation, as if skin were being scratched off the back of her neck.  
  
¬† And it wasn‚Äôt his words that set Safi‚Äôs magic to flaring. It was his presence. This monk was young, yet there was something off about him. Something too ruthless‚Äîtoo dangerous‚Äîto ever be trusted.  
  
¬† He pulled back his hood, revealing a pale face and close-cropped brown hair. Then, as the monk sniffed the air near Safi‚Äôs head, red swirled around his pupils.  
  
¬† Safi‚Äôs stomach turned to stone.  
  
¬† Bloodwitch.  
  
¬† This monk was a rutting Bloodwitch. A creature from the myths, a being who could smell a person‚Äôs blood‚Äîsmell their very witchery‚Äîand track it across entire continents. If he latched onto Safi‚Äôs or Iseult‚Äôs scent, then they were in deep, deep‚Äî  
  
¬† Pop-pop-pop!  
  
¬† Gunpowder burst inside firepots. The guards had hit the trap.  
  
¬† Safi acted instantly‚Äîas did the monk. His sword swished from its scabbard; her knife came up. She clipped the edge of his blade, parrying it aside.  
  
¬† He recovered and lunged. Safi lurched back. Her calves hit Iseult, yet in a single fluid movement, Iseult kneeled‚Äîand Safi rolled sideways over her back.  
  
¬† Initiate. Complete. It was how the girls fought. How they lived.  
  
¬† Safi unfurled from her flip and withdrew her sword just as Iseult‚Äôs moon scythes clinked free. Far behind them, more explosions thundered out. Shouts rose up, the horses kicked and whinnied.  
  
¬† Iseult spun for the monk‚Äôs chest. He jumped backward and skipped onto the carriage wheel. Yet where Safi had expected a moment of distraction, she only got the monk diving at her from above.  
  
¬† He was good. The best fighter she‚Äôd ever faced.  
  
¬† But Safi and Iseult were better.  
  
¬† Safi swooped out of reach just as Iseult wheeled into the monk‚Äôs path. In a blur of spinning steel, her scythes sliced into his arms, his chest, his gut‚Äîand then, like a tornado, she was past.  
  
¬† And Safi was waiting. Watching for what couldn‚Äôt be real and yet clearly was: every cut on the monk‚Äôs body was healing before her eyes.  
  
¬† There was no doubt now‚Äîthis monk was a thrice-damned Bloodwitch straight from Safi‚Äôs darkest nightmares. So she did the only thing she could conjure: she threw her parrying knife directly at the monk‚Äôs chest.  
  
¬† It thunked through his rib cage and embedded deep in his heart. He stumbled forward, hitting his knees‚Äîand his red eyes locked on Safi‚Äôs. His lips curled back. With a snarl, he wrenched the knife from his chest. The wound spurted ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† And began to heal over.  
  
¬† But Safi didn‚Äôt have time for another strike. The guards were doubling back. The Guildmaster was screaming from within his carriage, and the horses were charging into a frantic gallop.  
  
¬† Iseult darted in front of Safi, scythes flying fast and beating two arrows from the air. Then, for a brief moment, the carriage blocked the girls from the guards. Only the Bloodwitch could see them, and though he reached for his knives, he was too slow. Too drained from the magic of healing.  
  
¬† Yet he was smiling‚Äîsmiling‚Äîas if he knew something that Safi didn‚Äôt. As if he could and would hunt her down to make her pay for this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Iseult yanked at Safi‚Äôs arm, pulling her into a sprint toward the cliffside.  
  
¬† At least this was part of their plan. At least this they had practiced so often they could do it with their eyes closed.  
  
¬† Just as the first crossbow bolts pounded the road behind them, the girls reached a waist-high boulder on the ocean side of the road.  
  
¬† They plunked their blades back into scabbards. Then in two leaps, Safi was over the rock‚Äîand Iseult too. On the other side, the cliff ran straight down to thundering white waves.  
  
¬† Two ropes waited, affixed to a stake pounded deep into the earth. With far more speed and force than was ever intended for this escape, Safi snatched up her rope, hooked her foot in a loop at the end, gripped a knot at head level ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† And jumped.  
  
¬† TWO  
  
¬† Air whizzed past Safi‚Äôs ears and up her nose as she sprang out ‚Ä¶ down toward white waves ‚Ä¶ away from the seventy-foot cliff ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Until Safi reached the rope‚Äôs end. With a sharp yank that shattered through her body and tore into her gripping hands, she flew at the barnacle-covered cliffside.  
  
¬† This was about to hurt.  
  
¬† She hit with a crash, teeth ramming her tongue. Pain sizzled through her body. Limestone cut her arms, her face, her legs. She snapped out her hands to grip the cliff‚Äîjust as Iseult slammed into the rocks beside her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIgnite,‚Äù Safi grunted. The word that triggered the rope‚Äôs magic was lost in the roar of ocean waves‚Äîbut the command hit its mark. In a flash of white flame that shot up faster than eyes could travel, their ropes ignited ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† And disintegrated. A fine ash kicked away on the wind. A few specks settled on the girls‚Äô kerchiefs, their shoulders.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúArrows!‚Äù Iseult roared, flattening herself against the rock as bolts zipped past. Some skittered off the rocks, some sank into waves.  
  
¬† One sliced through Safi‚Äôs skirt. Then she‚Äôd managed to dig her toes in cracks, grab for han  
dholds, and scramble sideways. Her muscles trembled and strained until at last, she and Iseult had ducked beneath a slight overhang. Until at last, they could pause and let the arrows fall harmlessly around them.  
  
¬† The rocks were wet, the barnacles vicious, and water swept at the girls‚Äô ankles. Salty drops battered over and over. Until eventually the arrows stopped falling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre they coming?‚Äù Safi rasped at Iseult.  
  
¬† Iseult shook her head. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still there. I can feel their Threads waiting.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi blinked, trying to get the salt from her eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to swim, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù She rubbed her face on her shoulder; it didn‚Äôt help. ‚ÄúThink you can make it to the lighthouse?‚Äù Both girls were strong swimmers‚Äîbut strong didn‚Äôt matter in waves that could pummel a dolphin.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù Iseult said. She glanced at Safi with a fierceness that always made Safi feel stronger. ‚ÄúWe can toss our skirts left, and while the guards shoot those, we dive right.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi nodded, and with a grimace, she angled her body so she could remove her skirt. Once both girls had their brown skirts free, Iseult‚Äôs arm reared back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReady.‚Äù Safi heaved. The skirt flew out from beneath the overhang‚ÄîIseult‚Äôs right behind it.  
  
¬† And then both girls stepped away from the rock face and sank beneath the waves.  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† As Iseult det Midenzi wriggled free from her sea-soaked tunic, boots, pants, and finally underclothes, everything hurt. Every peeled-off layer revealed ten new slices from the limestone and barnacles, and each burst of spindrift made her aware of ten more.  
  
¬† This ancient, crumbling lighthouse was effective for hiding, but it was inescapable until the tide went out. For now, the water outside was well above Iseult‚Äôs chest, and hopefully that depth‚Äîas well as the crashing waves between here and the marshy shoreline‚Äîwould deter the Bloodwitch from following.  
  
¬† The interior of the lighthouse was no larger than Iseult‚Äôs attic bedroom over Mathew‚Äôs coffee shop. Sunlight beamed in through algae-slimed windows, and wind tugged sea foam through the arched door.  
I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Safi said, her voice muffled as she squirmed from her sodden tunic. Then her shirt was completely off, and she tossed it on a windowsill. Safi‚Äôs usually tanned skin was pale beneath her freckles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt apologize.‚Äù Iseult gathered her own discarded clothes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who told you about the card game in the first place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is true,‚Äù Safi replied, her voice shaking as she hopped on one foot and tried to remove her pants‚Äîwith her boots still on. She always did that, and it boggled Iseult‚Äôs mind that an eighteen-year-old could still be too impatient to undress herself properly. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù Safi added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who wanted the nicer rooms. If we‚Äôd just bought that place two weeks ago‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôd have rats for roommates,‚Äù Iseult interrupted. She shuffled to the nearest water-free, sunlit patch of floor. ‚ÄúYou were right to want a different place. It costs more, but it would‚Äôve been worth it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWould‚Äôve been being the key words.‚Äù With a loud grunt, Safi finally wrestled free of her pants. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be no place of our own now, Iz. I bet every guard in Ve√±aza City is out looking for us. Not to mention the‚Ä¶‚Äù For a moment, Safi stared at her boots. Then, in a frantic movement, she tore off the right one. ‚ÄúSo will the Bloodwitch.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blood. Witch. Blood. Witch. The words pulsed through Iseult in time to her heart. In time to her blood.  
  
¬† Iseult had never seen a Bloodwitch before ‚Ä¶ or anyone with a magic linked to the Void. Voidwitches were just scary stories after all‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt real. They didn‚Äôt guard Guildmasters and try to gut you with swords.  
  
¬† After wringing out her pants and smoothing each fold on a windowsill, Iseult shuffled to a leather satchel at the back of the lighthouse. She and Safi always stowed an emergency kit here before a heist, just in case the worst scenario unfolded.  
  
¬† Not that they‚Äôd held many heists before. Only every now and then for the lowlifes who deserved it.  
  
¬† Like those two apprentices who‚Äôd ruined one of Guildmaster Alix‚Äôs silk shipments and tried to blame it on Safi.  
  
¬† Or those thugs who‚Äôd busted into Mathew‚Äôs shop while he was away and stolen his silver cutlery.  
  
¬† Then there were those four separate occasions when Safi‚Äôs taro card games had ended in brawls and missing coins. Justice had been required, of course‚Äînot to mention the reclamation of pilfered goods.  
  
¬† Today‚Äôs encounter, though, was the first time the emergency satchel had actually been needed.  
  
¬† After rummaging past the spare clothes and a water bag, Iseult found two rags and a tub of lanolin. Then she hauled up the girls‚Äô discarded weapons and trudged back to Safi. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs clean our blades and come up with a plan. We have to get back to the city somehow.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi yanked off her second boot before accepting her sword and parrying knife. Both girls settled cross-legged on the rough floor, and Iseult sank into the familiar barnyard scent of the grease. Into the careful scrubbing motion of cleaning her scythes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did the Bloodwitch‚Äôs Threads look like?‚Äù Safi asked quietly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice,‚Äù Iseult murmured. ‚ÄúEverything happened so fast.‚Äù She rubbed all the harder at the steel, protecting her beautiful Marstoki blades‚Äîgifts from Mathew‚Äôs Heart-Thread, Habim‚Äîagainst rust.  
  
¬† A silence stretched through the stone ruins. The only sounds were the squeak of cloth on steel, the eternal crash of Jadansi waves.  
  
¬† Iseult knew she seemed unperturbed as she cleaned, but she was absolutely certain that her Threads twined with the same frightened shades as Safi‚Äôs.  
  
¬† Iseult was a Threadwitch though, which meant she couldn‚Äôt see her own Threads‚Äîor those of any other Threadwitch.  
  
¬† When her witchery had manifested at nine years old, Iseult‚Äôs heart had felt like it would pound itself to dust. She was crumbling beneath the weight of a million Threads, none of which were her own. Everywhere she looked, she saw the Threads that build, the Threads that bind, and the Threads that break. Yet she could never see her own Threads or how she wove into the world.  
  
¬† So, just as every Nomatsi Threadwitch did, Iseult had learned to keep her body cool when it ought to be hot. To keep her fingers still when they ought to be trembling. To ignore the emotions that drove everyone else.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think,‚Äù Safi said, scattering Iseult‚Äôs thoughts, ‚Äúthe Bloodwitch knows I‚Äôm a Truthwitch.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult‚Äôs scrubbing paused. ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù her voice was flat as the steel in her hands, ‚Äúwould you think that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause of the way he smiled at me.‚Äù Safi shivered. ‚ÄúHe smelled my magic, just like the tales say, and now he can hunt me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhich means he could be tracking us right now.‚Äù Frost ran down Iseult‚Äôs back. Jolted in her shoulders. She scoured at her blade all the harder.  
  
¬† Normally, the act of cleaning helped her find stasis. Helped her thoughts slow and her practicality rise to the surface. She was the natural tactician, while Safi was the one with the first sparks of an idea.  
  
¬† Initiate, complete.  
  
¬† Except no solutions came to Iseult right now. She and Safi could lie low and avoid city guards for a few weeks, but they couldn‚Äôt hide from a Bloodwitch.  
  
¬† Especially if that Bloodwitch knew what Safi was‚Äîand could sell her to the highest bidder.  
  
¬† When a person stood directly before Safi, she could tell truth from lie, reality from deception. And as far as Iseult had learned in her tutoring sessions with Mathew, the last recorded Truthwitch had died a century ago‚Äîbeheaded by a Marstoki emperor for allying herself with a Cartorran queen.  
  
¬† If Safi‚Äôs magic ever became public knowledge, she would be used as a political tool ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Or eliminated as a political threat.  
  
¬† Safi‚Äôs power was that valuable and that rare. Which was why, for Safi‚Äôs entire life, she‚Äôd kept her magic secret. Like Iseult, she was a heretic: an unregistered witch. The back of Safi‚Äôs right hand was unadorned, and no Witchmark tattoo proclaimed her powers. Yet one of these days, someone other than one of Safi‚Äôs closest friends would figure out what she was, and when that day came, soldiers would storm the Silk Guildmaster‚Äôs guest room and drag away Safi in chains.  
  
¬† Soon, the girls‚Äô blades were cleaned and resheathed, and Safi was pinning Iseult with one of her harder, more contemplative stares.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOut with it,‚Äù Iseult ordered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe may have to flee the city, Iz. Leave the Dalmotti Empire entirely.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult rolled her salty lips together, trying not to frown. Trying not to feel.  
  
¬† The thought of abandoning Ve√±aza City ‚Ä¶ Iseult couldn‚Äôt do it. The capital of the Dalmotti Empire was her home. The people in the Northern Wharf District had stopped noticing her pale Nomatsi skin or her angled Nomatsi eyes.  
  
¬† And it had taken her six and a half years to carve out that niche.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù Iseult said quietly, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs worry about getting into the city unseen‚Äîand let‚Äôs pray, too, that the Bloodwitch didn‚Äôt actually smell your blood.‚Äù Or your magic.  
  
¬† Safi huffed a weary sigh and nestled into a beam of sunlight. It made her skin glow, her hair luminescent. ‚ÄúTo whom should I pray?‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult scratched at her nose, grateful to have the subject shift. ‚ÄúWe were almost killed by a Carawen monk, so why not pray to the Origin Wells?‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi gave a little shudder. ‚ÄúIf that person prays to the Origin Wells, then I don‚Äôt want to. How about that Nubrevnan god? What‚Äôs His name?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNoden.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one.‚Äù Safi clasped her hands to her chest and stared up at the ceiling. ‚ÄúNoden, God of the Nubrevnan waves‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs all waves, Safi. And everything else too.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúGod of all waves and everything else too, can you please make sure no one comes after us? Especially ‚Ä¶ him. Just keep him far away. And if you could keep the Ve√±aza City guards away too, that would be nice.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is easily the worst prayer I have ever heard,‚Äù Iseult declared.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWeasels piss on you, Iz. I‚Äôm not done yet.‚Äù Safi heave  
d a sigh through her nose and then resumed her prayer. ‚ÄúPlease return all of our money to me before he or Habim get back from their trip. And ‚Ä¶ that is all. Thank you very much, oh sacred Noden.‚Äù Then, she hastily added, ‚ÄúOh, and please ensure that Chiseled Cheater gets exactly what he deserves.‚Äù  
  
¬† Iseult almost snorted at that last request‚Äîexcept that a wave crashed into the lighthouse, sudden and rough against the stone. Water splattered Iseult‚Äôs face. She swiped it away, agitated. Warm instead of cool.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, Noden,‚Äù she whispered, rubbing sea spray off her forehead. ‚ÄúPlease just get us through this alive.‚Äù  
  
¬† THREE  
  
¬† Reaching Mathew‚Äôs coffee shop where Iseult lived proved harder than Safi had anticipated. She and Iseult were exhausted, hungry, and bruised to hell-flames, so even the basic act of walking made Safi want to groan. Or sit down. Or at least ease her aches with a hot bath and pastries.  
  
¬† But baths and pastries weren‚Äôt happening anytime soon. Guards swarmed everywhere in Ve√±aza City, and by the time the girls had straggled into the Northern Wharf District, it was almost dawn. They‚Äôd spent half the night hiking blearily from their lighthouse to the capital and then the other half of the night slinking through alleys and clambering over kitchen gardens.  
  
¬† Every flash of white‚Äîevery dangling piece of laundry, every torn sailcloth or tattered curtain‚Äîhad punched Safi‚Äôs stomach into her mouth. But it had never been the Bloodwitch, thank the gods, and right as night began fading into dawn, the sign to Mathew‚Äôs coffee shop appeared. It poked out of a narrow road branching off the main wharf-side avenue.  
  
¬† REAL MARSTOKI COFFEE  
  
¬† BEST IN VE√ëAZA CITY  
  
¬† It was not, in fact, real Marstoki coffee‚ÄîMathew wasn‚Äôt even from the Empire of Marstok. Instead, the coffee was filtered and bland, catering to, as Habim always called it, ‚Äúdull western palates.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mathew‚Äôs coffee was also not the best in the city. Even Mathew would admit that the dingy hole-in-the-wall in the Southern Wharf District had much better coffee. But up here on the northern edges of the capital, people didn‚Äôt wander in for coffee. They came in for business.  
  
¬† The sort of business Wordwitches like Mathew excelled at‚Äîthe trade of rumors and secrets, the planning of heists and cons. He ran coffee shops all across the Witchlands, and any news about anything always reached Mathew first.  
  
¬† It was his Wordwitchery that had made Mathew the best choice for Safi‚Äôs tutor, since it allowed him to speak all tongues.  
  
¬† More important, though, Mathew‚Äôs Heart-Thread, Habim, had worked for Safi‚Äôs uncle her entire life‚Äîboth as a man-at-arms and as a constantly displeased instructor. So when Safi had been sent south, it had only made sense for Mathew to take over where Habim had left off.  
  
¬† Not that Habim had completely abandoned Safi‚Äôs training. He visited his Heart-Thread often in Ve√±aza City‚Äîand then proceeded to make Safi‚Äôs life miserable with extra hours of speed drills or ancient battle strategies.  
  
¬† Safi reached the coffee shop first and after hopping a puddle of sewage that was frighteningly orange, she began tapping out the lock-spell on the front door‚Äîa recent installment since the stolen cutlery incident. Habim could complain to Mathew all he wanted about the cost of an Aetherwitched lock-spell, but as far as Safi could see, it was worth the money. Ve√±aza City had a hefty crime rate‚Äîfirst because it was a port, and second because wealthy Guildmasters were just so appealing to piestra-hungry lowlifes.  
  
¬† Of course, it was those same elected Guildmasters who also paid for an extensive, seemingly endless collection of city guards‚Äîone of whom was pausing right at the alleyway‚Äôs mouth. He faced away, scanning the moored ships of the Northern Wharf District.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFaster,‚Äù Iseult muttered. She prodded Safi‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúThe guard is turning ‚Ä¶ turning‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† The door flew wide, Iseult shoved, and Safi toppled into the dark shop.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the rut?‚Äù she hissed, rounding on Iseult. ‚ÄúThe guards know us around here!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Iseult retorted, shutting the door and bolting the locks. ‚ÄúBut from afar, we look like two peasants busting into a locked up coffee shop.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi mumbled an unwilling, ‚ÄúGood point,‚Äù as Iseult stepped forward and whispered, ‚ÄúAlight.‚Äù  
  
¬† At once twenty-six bewitched wicks guttered to life, revealing bright, curly Marstoki designs on the walls, the ceiling, the floor. It was overdone‚Äîtoo many rugs of clashing patterns leapt at Safi‚Äîbut, like the coffee, westerners had a certain idea about how a Marstoki shop ought to look.  
  
¬† With the sigh of someone finally able to breathe, Iseult strode toward the spiral staircase in the back corner. Safi followed. Up, up they went, first to the second story, where Mathew and Habim lived. Next, to the slope-ceilinged attic that Iseult called home, its narrow space crowded with two cots and a wardrobe.  
  
¬† For six and a half years now, Iseult had lived and studied and worked here. After she‚Äôd fled her tribe, Mathew had been the only employer willing to hire and lodge a Nomatsi.  
  
¬† Iseult hadn‚Äôt moved away since‚Äîthough not for a lack of wanting to.  
  
¬† A place of my own.  
  
¬† Safi must‚Äôve heard her Threadsister say that a thousand times. A hundred thousand times. And maybe if Safi had grown up sharing a bed with her mother in a one-room hut as Iseult had, then she‚Äôd want a wider, more private, more personal space as well.  
  
¬† Yet ‚Ä¶ Safi had ruined all of Iseult‚Äôs plans. Every single saved piestra was gone, and all of the Ve√±aza City guards were actively hunting Safi and Iseult. It was literally the worst-case scenario possible, and no emergency satchel or hiding in a lighthouse was going to get them through this mess.  
  
¬† Gulping back nausea, Safi staggered to a window across the narrow room and shoved it open. Hot, fish-saturated air wafted in, familiar and soothing. With the sun just rising in the east, the clay rooftops of Ve√±aza City shone like orange flames.  
  
¬† It was beautiful, tranquil, and gods below, Safi loved that view. Having grown up in drafty ruins in the middle of the Orhin Mountains‚Äîhaving been locked away in the eastern wing whenever Uncle Eron was in one of his moods, Safi‚Äôs life in the Hasstrel castle had been filled with broken windows and snow seeping in. With frozen winds and dank, slithering mold. Everywhere she looked, her eyes would land on carvings or paintings or tapestries of the Hasstrel mountain bat. A grotesque, dragon-like creature with the motto ‚ÄúLove and Dread‚Äù scrolling through its talons.  
  
¬† But the bridges and canals of Ve√±aza City were always sunbaked and smelling wonderfully of rotten fish. Mathew‚Äôs shop was always bright and crowded. The wharves were always filled with sailors‚Äô deliciously offensive oaths.  
  
¬† Here, Safi felt warm. Here, she felt welcome, and sometimes, she even felt wanted.  
  
¬† Safi cleared her throat. Her hand fell from the latch, and she turned to find Iseult changing into a gown of olive green.  
  
¬† Iseult dipped her head to the wardrobe. ‚ÄúYou can wear my extra day gown.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll show these, though.‚Äù Safi rolled up a salt-stiffened sleeve to reveal scrapes and bruises peppering her arms‚Äîall of which would be visible in the short, capped sleeves that were in style.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs lucky for you I still have‚Ä¶‚Äù Iseult swept two cropped black jackets from the wardrobe. ‚ÄúThese!‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi‚Äôs lips crooked up. The jackets were standard attire for all Guild apprentices‚Äîand these two in particular were trophies from the girls‚Äô first holdup.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI still maintain,‚Äù Safi declared, ‚Äúthat we should‚Äôve taken more than just their jackets when we left them tied up in the storeroom.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, well, next time someone ruins a silk shipment and blames you, Saf, I promise we‚Äôll take more than just their jackets.‚Äù Iseult tossed the black wool to Safi, who swooped it from the air.  
  
¬† As she hastily tore off her clothes, Iseult settled on the edge of her cot, lips pursed to one side. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking,‚Äù she began evenly. ‚ÄúIf that Bloodwitch is really after us, then maybe the Silk Guildmaster could protect you. He‚Äôs your technical guardian after all, and you do live  
in his guest room.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll harbor a fugitive.‚Äù Safi‚Äôs face tightened with a wince. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be right to drag Guildmaster Alix into this anyway. He‚Äôs always been so kind to me, and I‚Äôd hate to repay him with trouble.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Iseult said, her expression unchanging. ‚ÄúMy next plan involves the Hell-Bards. They‚Äôre in Ve√±aza City for the Truce Summit, right? To protect the Cartorran Empire? Maybe you could appeal to them for help since your uncle used to be one‚Äîand I doubt even the Dalmotti guards would be stupid enough to cross a Hell-Bard.‚Äù  
  
¬† Safi‚Äôs wince only deepened at that idea. ‚ÄúUncle Eron was a dishonorably discharged Hell-Bard, Iz. The entire Hell-Bard Brigade now hates him, and Emperor Henrick hates him even more.‚Äù She snorted, a disdainful sound that skittered off the walls and rattled in her belly. ‚ÄúTo make it worse, the Emperor is looking for any excuse to hand over my title to one of his slimy sycophants. I‚Äôm sure that holding up a Guildmaster is sufficient reason to do so.‚Äù  
  
¬† For most of Safi‚Äôs childhood, her uncle had trained her like a soldier and treated her like one too‚Äîwhenever he‚Äôd been sober enough to pay attention, at least. But when Safi had turned twelve, Emperor Henrick had decided it was time for Safi to come to the Cartorran capital for her education. What does she know of leading farmers or organizing a harvest? Henrick had bellowed at Uncle Eron, while Safi had waited, small and silent, behind him. What experience does Safiya have running a household or paying tithes?  
  
¬† It was that last concern‚Äîthe paying of exorbitant Cartorran taxes‚Äîthat had Emperor Henrick the most concerned. With all of the nobility wrapped around his ring-clad fingers, he wanted to ensure he had Safi ensnared too.  
  
¬† But Henrick‚Äôs attempt to nab one more loyal domna had fallen apart, for Uncle Eron hadn‚Äôt sent Safi to study in Praga with all the other young nobles. Instead, Eron had packed her off to the south, to the Guildmasters and tutors of Ve√±aza City.  
  
¬† It was the first and last time Safi had ever felt anything like gratitude for her uncle.

1mkv9qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mkv9qw/should_you_switch_to_best_laundry_detergent_power/,Should You Switch to Best Laundry Detergent Power Paks Arm and Hammer,"Using the Arm & Hammer 033200942122 detergent packs daily has genuinely changed the way I approach laundry. The first thing I noticed is their convenience. These little Power Paks are a dream for someone like me who tends to either over-pour or under-measure. No more second-guessing how much detergent I should use, spilling liquid everywhere, or dealing with sticky caps‚Äîjust toss a pak in the washer, and it‚Äôs ready to go. This pre-measured format is a huge plus for chaotic mornings or when you‚Äôre juggling multiple tasks.  

The cleaning power of these paks is no joke. From kids' stained soccer jerseys to greasy kitchen towels, they‚Äôve handled everything with ease. Stains that typically required extra treatment‚Äîlike grass, mud, or even that accidental coffee spill‚Äîdisappeared after just one wash. Bright whites truly look brighter, and my colored fabrics maintain their vibrancy. There‚Äôs also a noticeable crisp, fresh scent that lingers for days‚Äînothing overpowering, just a pleasant aroma that makes your laundry feel extra clean.  

**Pluses**  
- Extremely convenient pre-measured Power Paks.  
- Tackles tough stains like food, grime, and mud effortlessly.  
- Works for both regular and HE washers.  
- Leaves a refreshing scent without being too strong.  

[Check Arm & Hammer 033200942122 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b076gsjv59/)  

The only initial hiccup I had was adjusting to the two-pak recommendation for heavily soiled loads because occasionally, I forgot and ended up with some dirt lingering. For massive laundry days, like post-camping, it‚Äôs necessary to follow that suggestion religiously. Additionally, these Power Paks don‚Äôt dissolve entirely in cold washes on rare occasions. I found a stray shell a couple of times, which could be slightly frustrating, though switching to warm or hot water fixed the issue.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Doesn‚Äôt fully dissolve in all cold water cycles.  
- Bigger loads may require extra paks, increasing usage.  

One of the most helpful aspects of these detergent packs is their adaptability. Whether you‚Äôre loading a standard washing machine or a high-efficiency one, these work seamlessly. I‚Äôve also tested their performance across various temperatures, and while warm and hot cycles yield the best results, they still perform decently in cooler settings‚Äîjust as long as there‚Äôs proper water flow.  

Compared to similar products like Tide Pods or Gain Flings, these packs hold their own. While Tide excels at tougher odor control (think gym clothes), and Gain brings in its signature strong scent, I feel Arm & Hammer straddles a sweet spot of powerful cleaning with a balanced fragrance. Moreover, the lack of any unnecessary gimmicky flamboyance in fragrance makes it great if you prefer a neutral smell for your laundry. In terms of tackling variety, the addition of OxiClean really elevates this from being just detergent to being a stain-fighting powerhouse. The cost per load is generally more budget-friendly compared to some competing detergent paks in the same category.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the performance, these packs deliver excellent value for their price. They handle more than 100 stains, leaving whites whiter and colors vibrant, which saves me from buying separate stain removers or specialty detergents. It‚Äôs the kind of product that balances affordability with reliability, making it a solid choice for households that care about both their wallet and their wardrobe.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a slide clip depend on several key features, including the material, size, grip strength, ease of use, and overall design. Understanding these aspects is crucial for selecting a slide clip that meets your particular requirements.

**Material Composition:** Slide clips are typically constructed from either metal or plastic.Metal clips, frequently enough made of stainless steel or spring steel, offer superior durability and grip strength, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. Plastic clips, conversely, are lighter, more resistant to corrosion, and often come in a wider variety of colors and designs.

The choice between metal and plastic depends on the intended use. For tasks requiring a secure hold and long-lasting performance, metal clips are generally preferred. Though, for lighter tasks or environments where corrosion is a concern, plastic clips might potentially be a more suitable option.In 2025, advanced plastic polymers offer enhanced durability, blurring the lines between the two categories.

This is steadfast by the strength of the spring mechanism and the design of the jaws.Clips with stronger springs provide a tighter grip, while those with textured or serrated jaws offer enhanced friction.The required grip strength depends on the weight and texture of the items being clipped. For holding delicate materials in place, a clip with a gentler grip is preferable to prevent damage. Though, for securing heavier items, a clip with a strong and reliable grip is essential.**Ease of Use and Ergonomics:** A good slide clip should be easy to open and close, even with one hand. The design of the handles or levers should provide a comfortable grip and require minimal effort to operate.Consider the frequency with which you will be using the clip. If you anticipate needing to open and close the clip repeatedly, prioritize models with ergonomic designs and smooth operation. Some clips also feature rubberized or padded grips for added comfort.

We went through a lot of misunderstandings and near break‚Äëups before we figured it out. Back then I assumed she was overreacting, and her startled jumps after every little noise felt like some kind of act to make things dramatic. My understanding has changed completely, and it‚Äôs brought us closer.

After nine years together, I can usually spot other HSPs, and I‚Äôve watched them get accidentally traumatized by strangers, colleagues, and even friends who have no idea how sensitive they are.

I always meant to write a guide on caring for HSPs, but a WA community admin beat me to it, btw they sharing many things like that, if someone need https://chat.whatsapp.com/DmBpa5sQJ01Dc9uwYUnnkB?mode=ac_t 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an HSP, and I‚Äôm tired of explaining why I ‚Äòoverreact,‚Äô what‚Äôs wrong, and why I leave the middle of a great party. Sharing this manual is my best hope that one day someone will say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not weird. I know you‚Äôre highly sensitive; I read the guide‚Ä¶.‚Äô‚Äù

A highly sensitive person‚Äôs senses and nervous system operate on a higher ‚Äúgain‚Äù setting. Think of the movie Senseless (1998): one ping on a coworker‚Äôs phone, and the coffee goes flying; a pigeon swoops overhead, and panic sets in; a raised voice during a silly pumpkin‚Äësoup debate, and everything freezes. Each shock lands harder and lingers longer, so flashbacks aren‚Äôt rare for us.

If you notice someone flinch at a clap, reread a text a dozen times before hitting send, freeze in a crowded room, or tear up when someone else cries, you may be looking at an HSP. Here‚Äôs how not to hurt us:

Start low and go slow with any activity, such as gym sessions, hikes, or parties. A friend once invited me on a moderate, newbie‚Äëfriendly 14‚Äëkm hike. I puked at the end because it was still too intense. And don‚Äôt get me started on the 48‚Äëhour Berlin party, I left after six hours, completely fried.

Please don‚Äôt prank or scare us for laughs. In school, I was the target: people loved my wide‚Äëeyed freeze or shrill scream. In my thirties, surprise jump‚Äëscares still nearly give me a heart attack, and I‚Äôve reflex‚Äëkicked more than one would‚Äëbe prankster, including my partner, who once popped up in a latex mask for a ‚Äúsexy surprise.‚Äù

Introduce new experiences and substances very carefully, and test one‚Äëthird of the recreational dose before giving an HSP the full amount. My worst experiences were my first roller coaster (at Disneyland, age 25) and a supposedly low dose of LSD, 70 ¬µg. While others had fun, I was in hell.

Don‚Äôt pity us. If I‚Äôm sitting in the corner at a party, nothing is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù; I‚Äôm just letting my overstimulated senses cool down.

Just let us cry. I can cry for any reason like smelling fresh bread that reminds me of my hometown bakery, being too empathetic and crying with a stranger at a caf√© after their breakup, kind words, harsh words‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how HSPs process strong emotions.

Sarcasm isn‚Äôt always obvious. It doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt read sarcasm; we can, but at first we take it seriously.

Give us time to think. When I say those words, I‚Äôm not stalling; I‚Äôm running a deep simulation. Friends who give me overnight to mull things over get thoughtful feedback. Friends who demand instant answers usually get a flustered yes that turns into a no after midnight rumination.

The good thing is that we experience joy and other pleasant emotions more intensely as well. Make us happy and we‚Äôll share double the joy right back.‚Äù

1. Open a Dedicated Business Bank Account

Start here. Having a separate account for all business income and expenses creates a clear paper trail, simplifies bookkeeping, and protects your business structure (especially for LLCs and corporations).



2. Get a Business Credit or Debit Card

Use a dedicated business card for all work-related purchases, no exceptions. This not only avoids accidental crossovers but also helps build business credit.



3. Pay Yourself a Salary or Owner's Draw

Instead of dipping into business funds whenever you need cash, set a consistent pay schedule. This reinforces separation and gives you a predictable personal income.



4. Keep Clean Records (Even for Small Stuff)

Track every transaction (even minor ones like subscriptions or coffee meetings). Use accounting software like QuickBooks Online to automatically categorize expenses.



5. Set Boundaries with Shared Tools or Subscriptions

The landing bays haven't gotten any less chaotic since the Bridger family had made their grand entrance and exit. If anything, it‚Äôs getting more energetic as various loved ones emerge from one ship or another. Marian‚Äôs holding onto Boone‚Äôs large, muscular arm for support as her heart tries to violently escape from her chest; to her left are Avia and Tyler, her boss and now apparent son-in-law.

She‚Äôs hardly even aware of them.

No one had told her.¬†

No one.

Not one fucking person had told her.¬†

Not till this very day.¬†

Not a word. Not a hint. Not a whisper.¬†

No one had said a damn thing about her father and brother apparently having managed to finagle some favors to book a one way trip on the Inevitable!¬†

She tries to calm herself down. Hyperventilating isn't going to help with any of this shit. It‚Äôs the opposite of helping! She needs to calm down.¬†

Oh, god.¬†

It all unravels for her in an instant. How insane had her life become?

She‚Äôs about to marry an alien man who could bench press a truck. She has a robot daughter. Said daughter is already technically a century old and has doctorates in disciplines Earth bound academics don't even know exist, and said daughter is already marrying a Human fighter pilot.¬†

That last note was a pretense of normalcy. At least for Marian's family. Considering she was from a lineage of fighter pilots stretching back to some of the first American combat pilots. A daughter of the Le Faes marrying a fighter pilot? Normal as could be.¬†

Not so fast, however! Said Human fighter pilot was married five times already to two literal angels, two dragon princesses and a four armed Playboy bunny who did gun kata for exercise... oh, and he had a girlfriend. Another dragon princess, but one who had near caramel skin, perfect blonde hair and was a complicated coffee order and a couple extra 'likes' in her speech away from being a Californian stereotype.¬†

Right through some sort of normal anything in what Marian's life had become since leaving Cruel Space and back to the deep weirdness.¬†

That‚Äôs not even mentioning that her fianc√© had recently been a slave to a band of truly evil space pirates, she'd taken part in the operation to help rescue him, and he had a passel of wives and daughters ranging from infants to girls or young women who were just shy of adulthood in their own right.¬†

She's back to hyperventilating again.¬†

How in the hell is her family going to DEAL with all that? Now that she has it all in front of her, how the hell is SHE dealing with all that, for that matter?¬†

And where the hell is her mother?

Jenny Le Fae had never been a fighter pilot, but she‚Äôs a veteran Marine spouse, and Marine mother. She'd always been there for and with her family, even if she had strongly objected to Marian joining the Dauntless mission. Surely Scott Senior, Marian's father, never would have left his dearly beloved wife back on Earth for a one way trip. Right? So why wasn't she mentioned in the message she'd received?¬†

Maybe her weird isn't the only weird going on around here. Marian isn't sure whether that makes the emotions she‚Äôs feeling better or worse.¬†

Marian lets out a soft groan and buries her face in her hands for a second.¬†

""I swear on the Morrigan's delicate brow, if someone specifically hid this little visit from me, I'm going to kill them.""¬†

""Mom... Chill. I'm sure Grandpa Scott and Uncle Scott will be fine. I mean, they're out here, right? Reasonable odds suggest Uncle Scott's already picked me up a new Auntie between here and Centris.""

Boone chuckles, shifting his arm a bit to let a big hand slide behind Marian, stroking her lower back, a warming comfort that Marian had been learning to appreciate from the big man. Say what you will about Nagasha, but no one gave hugs like Cannidor in Marian's book.

""Avia speaks well. No need to invite or invent trouble that hasn't come before us just yet. There's plenty of real trouble to deal with without... what was the idiom the Khan used... ah. Without tilting at windmills. Did I use that right?""

Marian lets out another groan before letting herself laugh. ""Yeah. You used it right... and you're both right. Though God only knows what type of alien wife Scotty would pick up. At least I know my Dad's safe on that front. Mom wouldn't be down for polygamy, no matter how normal it is out here.""¬†

There's a sharp whistle across the public address system.¬†

""Undaunted Passenger Transit from Centris, USFV Mercury now arriving, stand clear of pad three, bay 01-37C. Repeat, stand clear...""

The voice fades into the background noise for Marian as the Undaunted transport comes into view: a perfectly normal lighter with a few extra weapons and some armor.¬†

Not every Undaunted vessel could be a super ship in the end.¬†

Marian's eyes wander the area and a flash of red hair and a glittering crown draws her eye to a woman she recognized as Miri'Tok, one of the Apuk battle princesses. Married to the boss commando on the ship if she recalled correctly.

And there he is, too. Marian doesn't know Colonel Forsythe very well, only supporting him on the ground a few times as 'push knife six' or 'dagger six', but the stately gentlemen... also seems a bit nervous. Is he waiting on the same transport? For what? Or for who?¬†

It isn't her business, but she‚Äôs latching on to just about anything and everything to keep her mind distracted as the Mercury kills her engines and the boarding ramp starts to slide down. Her emotions are all over the place, her heart racing.¬†

Her dad always tried to be the first off any form of transport he was on... and sure enough, here he comes down the boarding ramp. A face Marian knows so well... except, instead of the distinguished old gentleman Marian knew as her father, a man in his mid sixties enjoying his retirement after serving as a three star general, he looks more like she and Scotty had another brother.¬†

But it‚Äôs him. It‚Äôs in his posture. In his stupid goofy smile. Her emotional mess settles on excitement and Marian races over and hugs her father. It‚Äôs only due to an act of divine mercy that she hasn't let out a sound somewhat like Cindy Bridger made on seeing her father again. It‚Äôs the situation. He looks... young. He‚Äôs 'returning' from another tour. It makes her feel like she‚Äôs seven all over again and she's been waiting for her daddy to make port after a long time at sea.

""Dad!""

""Hey there, tiger.""

His voice is still the same, Marian notes as she releases her father and gives Scotty a hug. He looked almost exactly the same as the last time Marian had seen him, save for slightly less weathering on his skin and he was wearing an Undaunted flight suit and jacket instead of Marine Corps standard issue.

""Scotty! I like the flight suit. Did you sign up? Again?""¬†

Scott Jr. chuckles. ""Yep. Sure did. Got to keep my rank even. I'll be joining the other Huscarl squadron on the ship, the Valkyries. Admiral Cistern said they needed an experienced executive officer and considering I just finished my XO tour the other year...""¬†

Marian chuckles.¬†

""Uh huh. Looking pretty young, too. Got youthened up a bit like Dad, old man? Well I have good news, I can introduce you to your new boss pretty easily‚Ä¶ but come on, let's get out of the way.""¬†

Marian leads the two men over to what is, in reality, the rest of her family. Her fianc√©, her daughter, her son in law... and her daughters in law... plus one girlfriend.¬†

""Dad, Scotty. Let me introduce you to everyone. This is Avia, your granddaughter and niece respectively.""¬†

Avia steps forward with a slight bow, unable to keep the nervous look off her face. Scott Senior peers at her for a second before saying, ""Ah, to hell with it,"" and bundling Avia up in a bear hug. ""Didn't get to give you them when you were growing up or however that works, so I guess we can start now!""¬†

Avia manages to giggle while laughing, ""Graaandpa!""¬†

Scott Senior lets Avia go and mimes staggering back like he's been wounded.¬†

""Oh, god. I apparently wasn't ready for that. So... who is everyone else?""¬†

Scott Senior's eyes follow along the group, a look on his face suggesting he already knew the score.¬†

Avia gestures to Tyler. ""This is my husband, Captain Tyler Sarkin, he's the air group commander on the ship, and also my pilot. Cascade, though she goes by Cassie. She is Tyler's first wife, and also flies with me as my WSO.""

Scott Senior and Scott Junior exchange a look.

""Guess that video wasn't too crazy after all, Dad. We have enough fighter pilots in the family, why not a fighter jet?""

""I've heard of being married to your ride but I gotta admit this one's a new one for me. Scott."" Scott Senior says, offering Tyler a firm handshake.¬†

Tyler shakes back, smiling.¬†

""Tyler. Yeah, can't say I was expecting that one either, but Avia's full of surprises.""¬†

He then shakes Scott Junior's hand.¬†

""Nice to meet you. Nice to have an extra set of surnames all over the place besides my own and the Bridgers.""¬†

There's a slight lull as Tyler finishes introducing his wives, with Scott Junior pointing out it's pretty convenient having your new boss and new boss's boss be your sister in law and brother in law respectively.¬†

Still, something‚Äôs bothering Marian. She'd gotten caught up in the rush of seeing her father and brother again, but Jenny Le Fae is conspicuous by her absence - something that overtakes even introducing Boone in importance when she finally finds a quiet moment to ask, ""...Dad. Not that I'm not happy to see you, but... How are you and Scotty here? I thought the Inevitable was here to hold us all in judgement, not bring tourists out of Cruel Space - and if you're here where's Mom? Didn't she come with you? Is she okay?""

The older Le Fae wilts suddenly, some of the spark coming out of him and reminding Marian just how old her father actually is.¬†

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ Well. Your. Jenny. Didn‚Äôt want to make the trip. She. Divorced me. Shortly after the Dauntless left.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did what!?‚Äù

Marian‚Äôs eyes open wide, shock coloring her. Sure she was a grown woman but her parents were suddenly divorced?¬†

‚Äú...Dad, what the hell happened?‚Äù

Scott Senior makes a pained noise as if remembering something unpleasant.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ want this to sound like I‚Äôm blaming you or like you‚Äôre at fault but I think you leaving Earth was the straw that broke the camel's back for her. She'd put up with so many deployments, so many times seeing her husband and her children go to sea or deploy to combat, and here I'd gone and 'let you' go off on a suicide mission to die in space. Maybe there was something else there, but I... Well. Suffice to say‚Ä¶ It. We probably shouldn‚Äôt. Talk about this here.‚Äù

The distinguished and newly young again gentleman pulls a kerchief from his pocket wiping his face for a moment before he continues;

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alright at least. Again we should talk about that in private. So that happened and then you all made first contact and the Inevitable was announced, Scotty and I talked and I called in some favors. There were a few hundred people on the Inevitable that weren't part of the crew.""

Scotty takes over, letting his father compose himself.¬†

""Yep. I was pretty fed up with the US government after some of the shit they pulled with the Dauntless, then trying to call you all traitors! I was at the end of my commitment so I was going to try out for the crew of the Inevitable, but Dad convinced me to go as a passenger. It was the right call once we found out what the Inevitable‚Äôs actual mission was.‚Äù

Scotty laughs, a slightly bitter tone to his voice that brightens with his eyes as he starts thinking about better times.

‚ÄúOn the plus side. It was an interesting transit for us. The secret cargo. All families. Ended up helping out a lot with various kids during the Zero G part of the trip. So I guess I qualified as a proper uncle, even if my only niece is a bit too old and way too tall for babying.‚Äù

Scotty and Avia exchange a look that almost spooks Marian for a second‚Ä¶ there was a photo of her exchanging that same grin with her brother. A potent reminder of just how ‚Äòher‚Äô Avia was, and a reassurance of her new life as elements of the old started to come together with it.¬†

‚ÄúAll sorts of back room deals went down to make that happen. The craziest one was Admiral Cistern's sons. Speaker Ticanped, the peacock lady who's the speaker for the entire Council? Yeah, she sent enough rare resources and technology on a null safe drone ship to Earth that it could reshape the entire planetary economy with a simple message. If Humanity wanted the goods... send her husband's sons to her. I spoke with them. The boys volunteered.""

""So what about you two? Not like you had anyone paying economy-altering amounts of raw material to get you out here.""

Scott Senior clears his throat gently. ""Ah. Well I still had some pull on Capitol Hill. I called in a lot of old favors, sold everything. Scotty and I don't have much more than the clothes on our back...""

Scotty elbows his father in the ribs lightly.¬†

""Well, until I swore my oath and took a position with the Undaunted... this old codger was going to play retiree... but then he took a job with the Undaunted late last week.""

""...Are you gonna be flying again, Dad?""

Scott Senior shakes his head. ""No, I took a ship command. Being just a captain is a bit of a demotion but you couldn't pay me to take flag rank again. On the plus side, I do have quite a bit of command experience and Admiral Cistern had a combatant craft come up that needed a skipper who could handle a few... pirates on his crew. Not sure if that's a metaphor or not, but the rest of my crew's inbound from Centris.""

Marian chuckles. ""They're probably being literal. Lots of former space pirates have been taken into Undaunted service. Never mind the actual privateers. I-""

Marian stops dead, covering her mouth. She hadn't introduced Boone!¬†

""Oh, my god. I didn't. Fuuuuuck. Dad this is-""

Before she can say anything a Cannidor woman pads up to the group, pushing a cart with a decent amount of luggage.

""Alright, boys, I got all our gear. These are the folks we're here to meet?""

Marian isn't exactly into girls, but she figures the Cannidor woman is beautiful to male eyes. To Marian she‚Äôs more what her mother would have called handsome. A rugged, natural beauty with a rich sable coat set off by red highlights and a pair of bright golden eyes to go with the standard issue titanic Cannidor curves.¬†

She has to be at least ten feet tall, with long, dark red hair down to her waist. The hints of silver in her fur suggest she's on the more 'mature' side, though for Cannidor that could mean anything from five hundred years old to a thousand.¬†

""...Uh. Dad. Scotty? Who‚Äôs this?""

""Oh. Uh.""¬†

Instead of Scotty like she'd been expecting, her father's face was looking about as red as Marian's face felt.¬†

""Don't worry, handsome. I can introduce myself."" The Cannidor woman grins. ""Ishana. I'm your new stepmom!""¬†

Shock hits Marian like a cold bucket of water and she can only say one thing: ""What!?""

1mkv4xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1mkv4xd/how_to_communicate_with_highly_sensitive_people/,How to communicate with highly sensitive people,"My wife (yeah I have a wife) is a highly sensitive person, and at the beginning of our relationship neither of us knew that. We went through a lot of misunderstandings and near break‚Äëups before we figured it out. Back then I assumed she was overreacting, and her startled jumps after every little noise felt like some kind of act to make things dramatic. My understanding has changed completely, and it‚Äôs brought us closer.

After nine years together, I can usually spot other HSPs, and I‚Äôve watched them get accidentally traumatized by strangers, colleagues, and even friends who have no idea how sensitive they are.

I always meant to write a guide on caring for HSPs, but a WA community admin beat me to it, btw they sharing many things like that, if someone need https://chat.whatsapp.com/DmBpa5sQJ01Dc9uwYUnnkB?mode=ac_t 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an HSP, and I‚Äôm tired of explaining why I ‚Äòoverreact,‚Äô what‚Äôs wrong, and why I leave the middle of a great party. Sharing this manual is my best hope that one day someone will say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not weird. I know you‚Äôre highly sensitive; I read the guide‚Ä¶.‚Äô‚Äù

A highly sensitive person‚Äôs senses and nervous system operate on a higher ‚Äúgain‚Äù setting. Think of the movie Senseless (1998): one ping on a coworker‚Äôs phone, and the coffee goes flying; a pigeon swoops overhead, and panic sets in; a raised voice during a silly pumpkin‚Äësoup debate, and everything freezes. Each shock lands harder and lingers longer, so flashbacks aren‚Äôt rare for us.

If you notice someone flinch at a clap, reread a text a dozen times before hitting send, freeze in a crowded room, or tear up when someone else cries, you may be looking at an HSP. Here‚Äôs how not to hurt us:

Start low and go slow with any activity, such as gym sessions, hikes, or parties. A friend once invited me on a moderate, newbie‚Äëfriendly 14‚Äëkm hike. I puked at the end because it was still too intense. And don‚Äôt get me started on the 48‚Äëhour Berlin party, I left after six hours, completely fried.

Please don‚Äôt prank or scare us for laughs. In school, I was the target: people loved my wide‚Äëeyed freeze or shrill scream. In my thirties, surprise jump‚Äëscares still nearly give me a heart attack, and I‚Äôve reflex‚Äëkicked more than one would‚Äëbe prankster, including my partner, who once popped up in a latex mask for a ‚Äúsexy surprise.‚Äù

Introduce new experiences and substances very carefully, and test one‚Äëthird of the recreational dose before giving an HSP the full amount. My worst experiences were my first roller coaster (at Disneyland, age 25) and a supposedly low dose of LSD, 70 ¬µg. While others had fun, I was in hell.

Don‚Äôt pity us. If I‚Äôm sitting in the corner at a party, nothing is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù; I‚Äôm just letting my overstimulated senses cool down.

Just let us cry. I can cry for any reason like smelling fresh bread that reminds me of my hometown bakery, being too empathetic and crying with a stranger at a caf√© after their breakup, kind words, harsh words‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how HSPs process strong emotions.

Sarcasm isn‚Äôt always obvious. It doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt read sarcasm; we can, but at first we take it seriously.

Give us time to think. When I say those words, I‚Äôm not stalling; I‚Äôm running a deep simulation. Friends who give me overnight to mull things over get thoughtful feedback. Friends who demand instant answers usually get a flustered yes that turns into a no after midnight rumination.

The good thing is that we experience joy and other pleasant emotions more intensely as well. Make us happy and we‚Äôll share double the joy right back.‚Äù

Picked up a cheap electric moka pot for work, 6 cup KITfanz. Bought a ""used, good condition"", overpaid maybe at $30. 

The boil dry protection thermostat doesn't work at all, but taking it off the base drops it from a boil pretty quickly. If you let it get about 1/2 full and remove from power it coasts to gentle stop without blowing the last bit of steam into the pot.

Makes a pretty good cup, light years better than any other coffee available at work and arguably just as good as my Grosche at home. 

Am going to replace the 125‚Å∞C thermostat with a 100‚Å∞ one to see if I can get it to come to a slightly more gentle boil (a 110‚Å∞C thermostat yielded no change). All in all a pretty good little pot for self-heating. ",4,1754659406.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1mkv2ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weirdstories/comments/1mkv2ze/the_burning_man/,The Burning Man,"The workmen were seated at the table beside hers, their long, tanned arms spread out behind them. The little food they'd ordered was almost gone. They had gotten refills of coffee. ‚ÄúNo, I'm telling you. There was no wife. He lived alone with the girl,‚Äù one was saying. 

Pola was eating alone.

She'd taken the day off work on account of the anticipated news from the doctor and the anxiety it caused. Sometime today, the doctor‚Äôd said. But there was nothing when she'd called this morning. We usually have biopsy results in the afternoon, the receptionist had told her. Call back then, OK? OK. In the meantime, she just wanted to take her mind off it. It's funny, isn't it? If she was sick, she was already sick, and if she was healthy, she was healthy, but either way she felt presently the same: just fine,‚Äù she told the waiter who was asking about the fried eggs she hadn't touched. ‚ÄúI like ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere *was* a wife, and it was the eighth floor they lived on,‚Äù one of the workmen said.

‚ÄúSixth floor, like me. And the wife was past tense, long dead by then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he went in *to get the wife*.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I heard too.‚Äù

‚Äú*Dead*. What he went in to get was the wife's ring.‚Äù

Although Pola was not normally one to eavesdrop, today she'd allowed herself the pleasure. Eat eggs, listen in on strangers‚Äô conversation, then maybe get the laundry to the laundromat, take a walk, enjoy the air, buy a coat. And make the call. In the afternoon, make the call.

She gulped. The cheap metal fork shook in her hand. She put it down on the plate. *Clink.* 

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said to the workmen‚Äîwho looked immediately over, a few sizing her up‚Äîbecause why not, today of all days, do something so unlike her, even if did make her feel embarrassed: ‚Äúbut would it be terribly rude of me to ask what it is you're disagreeing about?‚Äù

One grabbed his hat and pulled it off his head. ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam. Wouldn't be rude at all. What we're discussing is an incident that happened years ago near where Pete, who would be that ugly dog over there‚Äî‚Äù He pointed at a smiling man with missing teeth and a leathery face, who bowed his head. ‚Äú‚Äîan incident involving a man who died. That much we agree about. We agree also that he lived somewhere on a floor that was higher than lower, that this building caught fire and burned, and that the man burned too.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy gosh. How awful,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúA man burned to death‚Ä¶‚Äù (And she imagined this afternoon's phone call: the doctor's words (‚ÄúI'm very sorry, but the results‚Ä¶‚Äù) coming out of the receiver and into her ear as flames, and when the call ended she would walk sick and softly to the mirror and see her own face melting‚Ä¶)

‚ÄúWell, ma‚Äôam, see, now that part's something we don't agree on. Some of us this think he burned, others that he burned *to death*.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell it better,‚Äù said another workman.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù said Pola.

He downed the rest of his coffee. ‚ÄúOK, there was this guy who lived in a lower east side apartment building. He had a little daughter, and she lived there too. Whether there was a wife is apparently up in the air, but ultimately it doesn't matter. Anyway, one day there was a fire. People start yelling. The guy looks into the hall and smells smoke, so he grabs his daughter's hand and they both go out into the hall. ‚ÄòWait here for daddy,‚Äô he tells her. ‚ÄòNo matter what, don't move.‚Äô The little girl nods, and the guy goes back into the apartment *for some reason we don't agree on.* Meanwhile, somebody else exits another apartment on the same floor, sees the little girl in the hall, and, thinking she's alone, picks her up and they go down the fire escape together. All the time the little girl is kicking and screaming, ‚ÄòDaddy, daddy,‚Äô but this other person figures she's just scared of the fire. The motivation is good. They get themselves to safety.

‚ÄúThen the guy comes back out of the apartment, into the hall. He doesn't see his daughter. He calls her name. Once, twice. There's more smoke now. The fire‚Äôs spreading. A few people go by in a panic, and he asks them if they've seen a little girl, but nobody has. So he stays in the hall, calling his daughter‚Äôs name, looking for her, but she's already safe outside. And the fire is getting worse, and when the firemen come they can't get it under control. Everybody else but the guy is out. They're all standing a safe distance away, watching the building go up in flames. And the guy, he refuses to leave, even as things start collapsing. Even as he has trouble breathing. Even as he starts to burn.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever did find a body, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù said the first workman.

‚ÄúWhich is why we disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm telling you, he just burned up, turned to ash. From dust to dust. That's all there is to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I'm telling you they would have found something. Bones, teeth. Teeth don't burn. They certainly would've found teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúA tragedy, either way,‚Äù said Pola, finding herself strangely affected by the story, by the plight of the man and his young daughter, to the point she started to tear up, and to concentrate on hiding it. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the daughter?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you believe there was a wife‚Äîthe little girl‚Äôs mother‚Äîand believe she wasn't in the building, the girl ends up living with the mother, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you believe there was no mother: orphanage.‚Äù

Just then one of the workmen looked over at the clock on the wall and said, ‚ÄúI'll be damned if that half hour didn't go by like a quarter of one. Back to work, boys.‚Äù

They laid some money on the table.

They got up.

A few shook the last drops of coffee from their cups into their mouths. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, thank you for your company today. While brief, it was most welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúThank you for the story.‚Äù

With that, they left, arguing about whether the little girl‚Äôs name was Cindy or Joyce as they disappeared through the door, and the diner got a little quieter, and Pola was left alone, to worry again in silence.

She left her eggs in peace.

The laundromat wasn't far and the laundry wasn't much, but it felt heavy today, burdensome, and Pola was relieved when she finally got it through the laundromat doors. She set it down, smiled at the owner, who never smiled back but nevertheless gave the impression of dignified warmth, loaded a machine, paid and watched the wash cycle start. The machine hummed and creaked. The clothes went round and round and round. ‚ÄúI didn't say he only shows up at night,‚Äù an older woman was telling a younger woman a couple of washing machines away. ‚ÄúI said he's *more often seen at night*, on account of the aura he has.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, but I ain't never seen him, day or night,‚Äù said the younger woman. She was chewing bubble gum. She blew a bubble‚Äîit burst. ‚ÄúAnd I have a hard time believing in anything as silly as a candle-man.‚Äù

‚Äú*Burning* man,‚Äù the old woman corrected her. 

‚ÄúJeez, Louise. He could be the flashlight-monk for all I care. Why you take it so personal anyway, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's the trouble with your generation. You don't believe in anything, and you have no respect for the history of a place. You're rootless.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh, cause we ain't trees. We're people. And we do believe. I believe in laundry and getting my paycheque on time, and Friday nights and neon lights, and perfume, and handsome strangers and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw him once,‚Äù said Louise, curtly. ‚ÄúIt was about a decade ago now, down by the docks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just what was a nice old lady like you doing in a dirty place like that?‚Äù

Bubble‚Äîpop.

‚ÄúI wasn't quite so old then, and it's none of your business. The point is I was there and I saw him. It was after dark, and he was walking, if you can call it that, on the sidewalk.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust like that, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on, tell your fariy tale. What else am I going to listen to until my clothes is clean?‚Äù

Louise made a noise like an affronted buffalo, then continued: ‚ÄúWe were walking in opposite directions on the same side of the street. So he was coming towards me, and I was going towards him. There was hardly anyone else around. It must have been October because the leaves were starting to turn colours. Yellow, orange, red. And that's what he looked like from a distance, a dark figure with a halo of warm, fiery colours, all shifting and blending together. As he got closer, I heard a hiss and some crackles, like from a woodfire, and I smelled smoke. Not from like a cigarette either, but from a real blaze, with some bacon on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you scared?‚Äù asked the younger woman. ‚ÄúIn this scenario of yours, I mean. Don't think for a moment I believe you're saying the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, at first. Because I thought he was a wacko, one of those protesters who pour gasoline on themselves to change the world, but then I thought, He's not saying anything, and there's no one around, so what kind of protest could this be? Plus the way he was moving, it wasn't like someone struggling. He was calm, slow even. Like he was resigned to the state he was in. Like he'd been in it for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was all on fire but wasn't struggling or screaming or nothing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's right.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo suffering at all, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not externally. But internally‚Äîmy gosh, I've never seen another human being so brooding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I bet it was all in the eyes. Am I right, Louise?‚Äù

Pola was transfixed: by the washing machine, its spinning and its droning, by the slight imperfections in its circular movements, the way it had to be bolted down to prevent it from inching away from its spot, like a dog waiting for a treat, edging closer and closer to its owner, and out the door, and down the street, into a late New Zork City morning. 

‚ÄúEyes? Why, dearie, no. The Burning Man has no eyes. Just black, empty sockets. His eyes long ago melted down to whatever eyeballs melt down to. They were simply these two holes on either side of his nostrils. Deep, cavernous openings in a face that looked like someone's half-finished face carved out of charcoal. His whole body was like that. No clothes, no skin, no bones even. Just burnt, ashy blackness surrounded by flames, which you could feel. As we passed each other, I could feel the heat he was giving off.‚Äù

‚ÄúLouise, that's creepy. Stop it!‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm simply telling you what I experienced. You don't believe me anyway.‚Äù

The younger woman's cycle finished. She began transferring her load from the washer to a dryer. ‚ÄúDid he‚Äîdid he *do* anything to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe nodded at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat all?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's all, dearie. He did open his mouth, and I think he tried to say something, but I didn't understand it. All I heard was the hiss of a furnace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you *scared?* I get scared sometimes. Like when I watch a horror movie. Gawd, I hate horror movies. They're so stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not when he was close. If anything, I felt pity for him. Can you imagine: burning and burning and burning, but never away, never ending‚Ä¶‚Äù

The younger woman spat her bubble gum into her hand, then tossed it from her hand into a trashcan, as if ridding herself of the chewed up gum would rid her of the mental image of the Burning Man. ‚ÄúI ain't never seen him, and I don't plan to. He's not real. Only you would see a thing like that, Louise. It's your old age. You're a nutty old woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlenty of New Zorkers have seen the Burning Man. I'm hardly the only one. Sightings go back half a century.‚Äù

The dryer began its thudding.

‚ÄúWell, I ain't never even heard of it l till now, so‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's because you're not from here. You're from the Prairies or some such place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a *city* girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúDearie, if you keep resisting the tales of wherever you are, you'll be a *nowhere* girl. You don't want to be a nowhere girl, do you?‚Äù

The younger woman growled. She shoved a fresh piece of bubble gum into her lipsticked mouth, and asked, ‚ÄúWhat about you‚Äîever heard of this Burning Man?‚Äù

It took Pola a few moments to realize the question was meant for her. Both women were now staring in her direction. Indeed, it felt like the whole city was staring in her direction. ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù she said finally, just as her washing machine came to a stop, ‚ÄúI believe I have.‚Äù

Louise smiled. 

The younger woman made a bulldog face. ‚ÄúYou people are all crazy,‚Äù she muttered. 

‚ÄúI believe he had a daughter. Cindy, or Joyce,‚Äù said Pola.

‚ÄúAnd what was *she*, a firecracker?‚Äù said the younger woman, chewing her bubble gum furiously.

‚ÄúI believe, an orphan,‚Äù said Pola.

They conversed a while longer, then the younger woman's clothes finished drying and she left, and then Louise left too. Alone, Pola considered the time, which was coming up to noon, and whether she should go home and call the doctor or go pick out a coat. She looked through the laundromat windows outside, noted blue skies, then looked at the owner, who smiled, and then again, surprised, out the windows, through which she saw a saturation of greyness and the first sprinklings of snowfall. Coat it is, she thought, and after dropping her clean clothes just inside her front door, closed that door, locked it and stepped into winter.

Although it was only early afternoon, the clouds and falling snow obscured the sun, plunging the city into a premature night. The streetlights turned on. Cars rolled carefully along white streets.

Pola kept her hands in her pockets.

She felt cold on the outside but fever-warm inside.

When she reached the department store, it was nearly empty. Only a few customers lingered, no doubt delaying their exits into the unexpected blizzard. Clerks stood idle. Pola browsed women's coats when one of them said, ‚ÄúMiss, you must really want something.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù said Pola. 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said the clerk, ‚ÄúI just mean you must really want that coat to have braved such weather to get it.‚Äù He was young; a teenager, thought Pola. ‚ÄúBut that *is* a good choice,‚Äù he said, and she found herself holding a long, green frock she didn't remember picking up. ‚ÄúIt really suits you, Miss.‚Äù

She tried it on and considered herself in a mirror. In a mirror, she saw reflected the clerk, and behind him the store, and behind that the accumulating snow, behind which there was nothing: nothing visible, at least. 

Pola blushed, paid for the frock coat, put it on and passed outside. 

She didn't want to go home yet. 

Traffic thinned.

A few happy, hatless children ran past her with coats unbuttoned, dragging behind them toboggans, laughing, laughing.

The encompassing whiteness disoriented her.

Sounds carried farther than sight, but even they were dulled, subsumed by the enclosed cityscape.

She could have been anywhere.

The snowflakes tasted of blood, the air smelled of fragility.

Walking, Pola felt as if she were crushing underfoot tiny palaces of ice, and it was against this tableaux of swirling breaking blankness that she beheld him. Distantly, at first: a pale ember in the unnatural dark. Then closer, as she neared.

She stopped, breathed in a sharpness of fear; and exhaled an anxiety of steam.

Continued.

He was like a small sun come down from the heavens, a walking torchhead, a blistering cat‚Äôs eye unblinking‚Äîits orb, fully aflame, bisected vertically by a pupil of char.

But there was no mistaking his humanity, past or present.

He was a man.

He was the Burning Man.

To Pola‚Äôs left was a bus stop, devoid of standers-by. To her right was nothing at all. Behind her, in the direction the children had run, was the from-where-she‚Äôd-come which passes always and irrevocably into memory, and ahead: ahead was he.

Then a bus came.

A woman, in her fifties or sixties, got off. She was wearing a worn fur coat, boots. On her right hand she had a gold ring. She held a black purse.

The bus disappeared into snow like static.

The woman crossed the street, but as she did a figure appeared.

A male figure.

‚ÄúHey, bitch!‚Äù the figure said to the woman in the worn fur coat. ‚ÄúWhatcha got in that purse. Lemme take a look! Ya got any money in there? Ya do, dontcha! What else ya got, huh? What else ya got *between yer fucking legs, bitch?*‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Pola yelled‚Äî*in silence.*

The male figure moved towards the woman, stalking her. The woman walked faster, but the figure faster-yet. ‚ÄúHere, pussy pussy pussy‚Ä¶‚Äù

To Pola, they were silhouettes, lighted from the side by the aura of the Burning Man.

‚ÄúHere, take it,‚Äù the woman said, handing over her purse.

The figure tore through it, tossing its contents aside on the fresh snow. Pocketing wads of cash. Pocketing whatever else felt of value.

‚ÄúGimme the ring you got,‚Äù the figure barked.

The woman hesitated.

The figure pulled out a knife. ‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll cut it off you, bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll fuck you with this knife. Swear to our dear absent God‚Äîya fucking hear me?‚Äù

It was then Pola noticed that the Burning Man had moved. His light was no longer coming from the side of the scene unfolding before her but from the back. He was behind the figure, who raised the hand holding the knife and was about to stab downwards when the Burning Man‚Äôs black, fiery fingers touched him on the shoulder, and the male figure screamed, dropping the knife, turning and coming face-to-face with the Burning Man‚Äôs burning face, with its empty eyes and open, hissing mouth.

The woman had fallen backwards onto the snow.

The woman looked at the Burning Man and the Burning Man looked at her, and in a moment of utter recognition, the Burning Man‚Äôs grip eased from the figure‚Äôs shoulder. The figure, leaving the dropped knife, and bleeding from where the Burning Man had briefly held him, fled.

The woman got up‚Äî

The Burning Man stood before her.

‚Äîand began to cry.

Around them the snow had melted, revealing wet asphalt underneath.

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù she whispered.

When her tears hit the exposed asphalt, they turned to steam which rose up like gossamer strands before dissipating into the clouds.

The Burning Man began to emit puffs of smoke. His light‚Äîhis *burning*‚Äîfaltered, and the heat surrounding him weakened. Soon, flakes of snow, which had heretofore evaporated well before reaching him, started to touch his cheeks, his coal body. And starting from the top of his head, he ashed and fell away, crumbling into a pile of black dust at the woman‚Äôs boots, which soon the snowfall buried.

And a great gust of wind scattered it all.

After a time, the blizzard diminished. Pola approached the woman, who was still sobbing, and helped pick up the contents of her handbag lying on the snow. One of them was a driver‚Äôs license, on which Pola caught the woman‚Äôs first name: Joyce.

Pola walked into her apartment, took off her shoes and placed them on a tray to collect the remnants of packed snow between their treads.

She pushed open the living room curtains.

The city was wet, but the sky was blue and bright and filled the room, and there was hardly any trace left of the snowstorm.

She sat by the phone.

She picked up the handset and with her other hand dialed the number for the doctor.

She waited.

‚ÄúHello. My name is‚Äî,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I understand. Tuesday at eleven o‚Äôclock will be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said, and put the handset back on the telephone switch hook. She remained seated. The snow in the shoe tray melted. The clock ticked. The city filled up with its usual bustle of cars and people. She didn‚Äôt feel any different than when she‚Äôd woken up, or gone to sleep, or worked last week, or shopped two weeks ago, or taken the ferry, or gone ice skating, or‚Äîexcept none of that was true, not quite; for she had gained something today. Something, ironically, *vital.* On the day she learned that within a year she would most probably be dead, Pola had acquired something transcendentally human.

Not entirely sure where life will take me next (I like keeping my options open), but Brazil feels like home for now. I work as a QA analyst during the day and I'm starting to study more to advance my career. My days are pretty packed with work, but evenings and nights are my time to unwind and connect with people.

**What makes me happy:**

* üçù Cooking (and yes, I'll cook for you if we ever meet!)
* üé¨ Getting lost in mystery movies and series
* üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Long walks where the best conversations happen
* üåç Traveling > 14 countries down, so many more to go!

I'm someone who thrives on deep conversations and hearing different perspectives on life. What I'm really hoping to find is someone who's kind, emotionally available, and excited about creating memories together, whether that's planning adventures around the world or just talking about everything and nothing over coffee (or wine, I don't discriminate üòÑ).

**What I'm looking for:**

* Age range: 27-40
* Location: Anywhere! I love the idea of LDR and travel is always a good excuse to visit (and I'd absolutely love to show someone around Brazil too!)
* Someone genuine who's also looking for something real and meaningful
* Someone who enjoys voice notes and long calls ‚Äî I love that personal touch
* Someone who appreciates giving and receiving special attention
* Bonus points if you're in tech and could share some career wisdom with me!
* Extra bonus points if you're curious about the world and open to new experiences

If you're the type who believes in authentic connections and isn't afraid of a little adventure (even if it starts with late-night messages across time zones), I'd love to hear from you ‚ú®

1mkv16e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mkv16e/sp_the_burning_man/,[SP] The Burning Man,"The workmen were seated at the table beside hers, their long, tanned arms spread out behind them. The little food they'd ordered was almost gone. They had gotten refills of coffee. ‚ÄúNo, I'm telling you. There was no wife. He lived alone with the girl,‚Äù one was saying. 

Pola was eating alone.

She'd taken the day off work on account of the anticipated news from the doctor and the anxiety it caused. Sometime today, the doctor‚Äôd said. But there was nothing when she'd called this morning. We usually have biopsy results in the afternoon, the receptionist had told her. Call back then, OK? OK. In the meantime, she just wanted to take her mind off it. It's funny, isn't it? If she was sick, she was already sick, and if she was healthy, she was healthy, but either way she felt presently the same: just fine,‚Äù she told the waiter who was asking about the fried eggs she hadn't touched. ‚ÄúI like ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere *was* a wife, and it was the eighth floor they lived on,‚Äù one of the workmen said.

‚ÄúSixth floor, like me. And the wife was past tense, long dead by then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he went in *to get the wife*.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I heard too.‚Äù

‚Äú*Dead*. What he went in to get was the wife's ring.‚Äù

Although Pola was not normally one to eavesdrop, today she'd allowed herself the pleasure. Eat eggs, listen in on strangers‚Äô conversation, then maybe get the laundry to the laundromat, take a walk, enjoy the air, buy a coat. And make the call. In the afternoon, make the call.

She gulped. The cheap metal fork shook in her hand. She put it down on the plate. *Clink.* 

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said to the workmen‚Äîwho looked immediately over, a few sizing her up‚Äîbecause why not, today of all days, do something so unlike her, even if did make her feel embarrassed: ‚Äúbut would it be terribly rude of me to ask what it is you're disagreeing about?‚Äù

One grabbed his hat and pulled it off his head. ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam. Wouldn't be rude at all. What we're discussing is an incident that happened years ago near where Pete, who would be that ugly dog over there‚Äî‚Äù He pointed at a smiling man with missing teeth and a leathery face, who bowed his head. ‚Äú‚Äîan incident involving a man who died. That much we agree about. We agree also that he lived somewhere on a floor that was higher than lower, that this building caught fire and burned, and that the man burned too.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy gosh. How awful,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúA man burned to death‚Ä¶‚Äù (And she imagined this afternoon's phone call: the doctor's words (‚ÄúI'm very sorry, but the results‚Ä¶‚Äù) coming out of the receiver and into her ear as flames, and when the call ended she would walk sick and softly to the mirror and see her own face melting‚Ä¶)

‚ÄúWell, ma‚Äôam, see, now that part's something we don't agree on. Some of us this think he burned, others that he burned *to death*.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell it better,‚Äù said another workman.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù said Pola.

He downed the rest of his coffee. ‚ÄúOK, there was this guy who lived in a lower east side apartment building. He had a little daughter, and she lived there too. Whether there was a wife is apparently up in the air, but ultimately it doesn't matter. Anyway, one day there was a fire. People start yelling. The guy looks into the hall and smells smoke, so he grabs his daughter's hand and they both go out into the hall. ‚ÄòWait here for daddy,‚Äô he tells her. ‚ÄòNo matter what, don't move.‚Äô The little girl nods, and the guy goes back into the apartment *for some reason we don't agree on.* Meanwhile, somebody else exits another apartment on the same floor, sees the little girl in the hall, and, thinking she's alone, picks her up and they go down the fire escape together. All the time the little girl is kicking and screaming, ‚ÄòDaddy, daddy,‚Äô but this other person figures she's just scared of the fire. The motivation is good. They get themselves to safety.

‚ÄúThen the guy comes back out of the apartment, into the hall. He doesn't see his daughter. He calls her name. Once, twice. There's more smoke now. The fire‚Äôs spreading. A few people go by in a panic, and he asks them if they've seen a little girl, but nobody has. So he stays in the hall, calling his daughter‚Äôs name, looking for her, but she's already safe outside. And the fire is getting worse, and when the firemen come they can't get it under control. Everybody else but the guy is out. They're all standing a safe distance away, watching the building go up in flames. And the guy, he refuses to leave, even as things start collapsing. Even as he has trouble breathing. Even as he starts to burn.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever did find a body, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù said the first workman.

‚ÄúWhich is why we disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm telling you, he just burned up, turned to ash. From dust to dust. That's all there is to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I'm telling you they would have found something. Bones, teeth. Teeth don't burn. They certainly would've found teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúA tragedy, either way,‚Äù said Pola, finding herself strangely affected by the story, by the plight of the man and his young daughter, to the point she started to tear up, and to concentrate on hiding it. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the daughter?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you believe there was a wife‚Äîthe little girl‚Äôs mother‚Äîand believe she wasn't in the building, the girl ends up living with the mother, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you believe there was no mother: orphanage.‚Äù

Just then one of the workmen looked over at the clock on the wall and said, ‚ÄúI'll be damned if that half hour didn't go by like a quarter of one. Back to work, boys.‚Äù

They laid some money on the table.

They got up.

A few shook the last drops of coffee from their cups into their mouths. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, thank you for your company today. While brief, it was most welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúThank you for the story.‚Äù

With that, they left, arguing about whether the little girl‚Äôs name was Cindy or Joyce as they disappeared through the door, and the diner got a little quieter, and Pola was left alone, to worry again in silence.

She left her eggs in peace.

The laundromat wasn't far and the laundry wasn't much, but it felt heavy today, burdensome, and Pola was relieved when she finally got it through the laundromat doors. She set it down, smiled at the owner, who never smiled back but nevertheless gave the impression of dignified warmth, loaded a machine, paid and watched the wash cycle start. The machine hummed and creaked. The clothes went round and round and round. ‚ÄúI didn't say he only shows up at night,‚Äù an older woman was telling a younger woman a couple of washing machines away. ‚ÄúI said he's *more often seen at night*, on account of the aura he has.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, but I ain't never seen him, day or night,‚Äù said the younger woman. She was chewing bubble gum. She blew a bubble‚Äîit burst. ‚ÄúAnd I have a hard time believing in anything as silly as a candle-man.‚Äù

‚Äú*Burning* man,‚Äù the old woman corrected her. 

‚ÄúJeez, Louise. He could be the flashlight-monk for all I care. Why you take it so personal anyway, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's the trouble with your generation. You don't believe in anything, and you have no respect for the history of a place. You're rootless.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh, cause we ain't trees. We're people. And we do believe. I believe in laundry and getting my paycheque on time, and Friday nights and neon lights, and perfume, and handsome strangers and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw him once,‚Äù said Louise, curtly. ‚ÄúIt was about a decade ago now, down by the docks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just what was a nice old lady like you doing in a dirty place like that?‚Äù

Bubble‚Äîpop.

‚ÄúI wasn't quite so old then, and it's none of your business. The point is I was there and I saw him. It was after dark, and he was walking, if you can call it that, on the sidewalk.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust like that, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on, tell your fariy tale. What else am I going to listen to until my clothes is clean?‚Äù

Louise made a noise like an affronted buffalo, then continued: ‚ÄúWe were walking in opposite directions on the same side of the street. So he was coming towards me, and I was going towards him. There was hardly anyone else around. It must have been October because the leaves were starting to turn colours. Yellow, orange, red. And that's what he looked like from a distance, a dark figure with a halo of warm, fiery colours, all shifting and blending together. As he got closer, I heard a hiss and some crackles, like from a woodfire, and I smelled smoke. Not from like a cigarette either, but from a real blaze, with some bacon on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you scared?‚Äù asked the younger woman. ‚ÄúIn this scenario of yours, I mean. Don't think for a moment I believe you're saying the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, at first. Because I thought he was a wacko, one of those protesters who pour gasoline on themselves to change the world, but then I thought, He's not saying anything, and there's no one around, so what kind of protest could this be? Plus the way he was moving, it wasn't like someone struggling. He was calm, slow even. Like he was resigned to the state he was in. Like he'd been in it for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was all on fire but wasn't struggling or screaming or nothing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's right.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo suffering at all, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not externally. But internally‚Äîmy gosh, I've never seen another human being so brooding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I bet it was all in the eyes. Am I right, Louise?‚Äù

Pola was transfixed: by the washing machine, its spinning and its droning, by the slight imperfections in its circular movements, the way it had to be bolted down to prevent it from inching away from its spot, like a dog waiting for a treat, edging closer and closer to its owner, and out the door, and down the street, into a late New Zork City morning. 

‚ÄúEyes? Why, dearie, no. The Burning Man has no eyes. Just black, empty sockets. His eyes long ago melted down to whatever eyeballs melt down to. They were simply these two holes on either side of his nostrils. Deep, cavernous openings in a face that looked like someone's half-finished face carved out of charcoal. His whole body was like that. No clothes, no skin, no bones even. Just burnt, ashy blackness surrounded by flames, which you could feel. As we passed each other, I could feel the heat he was giving off.‚Äù

‚ÄúLouise, that's creepy. Stop it!‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm simply telling you what I experienced. You don't believe me anyway.‚Äù

The younger woman's cycle finished. She began transferring her load from the washer to a dryer. ‚ÄúDid he‚Äîdid he *do* anything to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe nodded at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat all?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's all, dearie. He did open his mouth, and I think he tried to say something, but I didn't understand it. All I heard was the hiss of a furnace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you *scared?* I get scared sometimes. Like when I watch a horror movie. Gawd, I hate horror movies. They're so stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not when he was close. If anything, I felt pity for him. Can you imagine: burning and burning and burning, but never away, never ending‚Ä¶‚Äù

The younger woman spat her bubble gum into her hand, then tossed it from her hand into a trashcan, as if ridding herself of the chewed up gum would rid her of the mental image of the Burning Man. ‚ÄúI ain't never seen him, and I don't plan to. He's not real. Only you would see a thing like that, Louise. It's your old age. You're a nutty old woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlenty of New Zorkers have seen the Burning Man. I'm hardly the only one. Sightings go back half a century.‚Äù

The dryer began its thudding.

‚ÄúWell, I ain't never even heard of it l till now, so‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's because you're not from here. You're from the Prairies or some such place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a *city* girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúDearie, if you keep resisting the tales of wherever you are, you'll be a *nowhere* girl. You don't want to be a nowhere girl, do you?‚Äù

The younger woman growled. She shoved a fresh piece of bubble gum into her lipsticked mouth, and asked, ‚ÄúWhat about you‚Äîever heard of this Burning Man?‚Äù

It took Pola a few moments to realize the question was meant for her. Both women were now staring in her direction. Indeed, it felt like the whole city was staring in her direction. ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù she said finally, just as her washing machine came to a stop, ‚ÄúI believe I have.‚Äù

Louise smiled. 

The younger woman made a bulldog face. ‚ÄúYou people are all crazy,‚Äù she muttered. 

‚ÄúI believe he had a daughter. Cindy, or Joyce,‚Äù said Pola.

‚ÄúAnd what was *she*, a firecracker?‚Äù said the younger woman, chewing her bubble gum furiously.

‚ÄúI believe, an orphan,‚Äù said Pola.

They conversed a while longer, then the younger woman's clothes finished drying and she left, and then Louise left too. Alone, Pola considered the time, which was coming up to noon, and whether she should go home and call the doctor or go pick out a coat. She looked through the laundromat windows outside, noted blue skies, then looked at the owner, who smiled, and then again, surprised, out the windows, through which she saw a saturation of greyness and the first sprinklings of snowfall. Coat it is, she thought, and after dropping her clean clothes just inside her front door, closed that door, locked it and stepped into winter.

Although it was only early afternoon, the clouds and falling snow obscured the sun, plunging the city into a premature night. The streetlights turned on. Cars rolled carefully along white streets.

Pola kept her hands in her pockets.

She felt cold on the outside but fever-warm inside.

When she reached the department store, it was nearly empty. Only a few customers lingered, no doubt delaying their exits into the unexpected blizzard. Clerks stood idle. Pola browsed women's coats when one of them said, ‚ÄúMiss, you must really want something.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù said Pola. 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said the clerk, ‚ÄúI just mean you must really want that coat to have braved such weather to get it.‚Äù He was young; a teenager, thought Pola. ‚ÄúBut that *is* a good choice,‚Äù he said, and she found herself holding a long, green frock she didn't remember picking up. ‚ÄúIt really suits you, Miss.‚Äù

She tried it on and considered herself in a mirror. In a mirror, she saw reflected the clerk, and behind him the store, and behind that the accumulating snow, behind which there was nothing: nothing visible, at least. 

Pola blushed, paid for the frock coat, put it on and passed outside. 

She didn't want to go home yet. 

Traffic thinned.

A few happy, hatless children ran past her with coats unbuttoned, dragging behind them toboggans, laughing, laughing.

The encompassing whiteness disoriented her.

Sounds carried farther than sight, but even they were dulled, subsumed by the enclosed cityscape.

She could have been anywhere.

The snowflakes tasted of blood, the air smelled of fragility.

Walking, Pola felt as if she were crushing underfoot tiny palaces of ice, and it was against this tableaux of swirling breaking blankness that she beheld him. Distantly, at first: a pale ember in the unnatural dark. Then closer, as she neared.

She stopped, breathed in a sharpness of fear; and exhaled an anxiety of steam.

Continued.

He was like a small sun come down from the heavens, a walking torchhead, a blistering cat‚Äôs eye unblinking‚Äîits orb, fully aflame, bisected vertically by a pupil of char.

But there was no mistaking his humanity, past or present.

He was a man.

He was the Burning Man.

To Pola‚Äôs left was a bus stop, devoid of standers-by. To her right was nothing at all. Behind her, in the direction the children had run, was the from-where-she‚Äôd-come which passes always and irrevocably into memory, and ahead: ahead was he.

Then a bus came.

A woman, in her fifties or sixties, got off. She was wearing a worn fur coat, boots. On her right hand she had a gold ring. She held a black purse.

The bus disappeared into snow like static.

The woman crossed the street, but as she did a figure appeared.

A male figure.

‚ÄúHey, bitch!‚Äù the figure said to the woman in the worn fur coat. ‚ÄúWhatcha got in that purse. Lemme take a look! Ya got any money in there? Ya do, dontcha! What else ya got, huh? What else ya got *between yer fucking legs, bitch?*‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Pola yelled‚Äî*in silence.*

The male figure moved towards the woman, stalking her. The woman walked faster, but the figure faster-yet. ‚ÄúHere, pussy pussy pussy‚Ä¶‚Äù

To Pola, they were silhouettes, lighted from the side by the aura of the Burning Man.

‚ÄúHere, take it,‚Äù the woman said, handing over her purse.

The figure tore through it, tossing its contents aside on the fresh snow. Pocketing wads of cash. Pocketing whatever else felt of value.

‚ÄúGimme the ring you got,‚Äù the figure barked.

The woman hesitated.

The figure pulled out a knife. ‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll cut it off you, bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll fuck you with this knife. Swear to our dear absent God‚Äîya fucking hear me?‚Äù

It was then Pola noticed that the Burning Man had moved. His light was no longer coming from the side of the scene unfolding before her but from the back. He was behind the figure, who raised the hand holding the knife and was about to stab downwards when the Burning Man‚Äôs black, fiery fingers touched him on the shoulder, and the male figure screamed, dropping the knife, turning and coming face-to-face with the Burning Man‚Äôs burning face, with its empty eyes and open, hissing mouth.

The woman had fallen backwards onto the snow.

The woman looked at the Burning Man and the Burning Man looked at her, and in a moment of utter recognition, the Burning Man‚Äôs grip eased from the figure‚Äôs shoulder. The figure, leaving the dropped knife, and bleeding from where the Burning Man had briefly held him, fled.

The woman got up‚Äî

The Burning Man stood before her.

‚Äîand began to cry.

Around them the snow had melted, revealing wet asphalt underneath.

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù she whispered.

When her tears hit the exposed asphalt, they turned to steam which rose up like gossamer strands before dissipating into the clouds.

The Burning Man began to emit puffs of smoke. His light‚Äîhis *burning*‚Äîfaltered, and the heat surrounding him weakened. Soon, flakes of snow, which had heretofore evaporated well before reaching him, started to touch his cheeks, his coal body. And starting from the top of his head, he ashed and fell away, crumbling into a pile of black dust at the woman‚Äôs boots, which soon the snowfall buried.

And a great gust of wind scattered it all.

After a time, the blizzard diminished. Pola approached the woman, who was still sobbing, and helped pick up the contents of her handbag lying on the snow. One of them was a driver‚Äôs license, on which Pola caught the woman‚Äôs first name: Joyce.

Pola walked into her apartment, took off her shoes and placed them on a tray to collect the remnants of packed snow between their treads.

She pushed open the living room curtains.

The city was wet, but the sky was blue and bright and filled the room, and there was hardly any trace left of the snowstorm.

She sat by the phone.

She picked up the handset and with her other hand dialed the number for the doctor.

She waited.

‚ÄúHello. My name is‚Äî,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I understand. Tuesday at eleven o‚Äôclock will be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said, and put the handset back on the telephone switch hook. She remained seated. The snow in the shoe tray melted. The clock ticked. The city filled up with its usual bustle of cars and people. She didn‚Äôt feel any different than when she‚Äôd woken up, or gone to sleep, or worked last week, or shopped two weeks ago, or taken the ferry, or gone ice skating, or‚Äîexcept none of that was true, not quite; for she had gained something today. Something, ironically, *vital.* On the day she learned that within a year she would most probably be dead, Pola had acquired something transcendentally human.

1mkv0yq,https://i.redd.it/o6ubpomoqshf1.jpeg,First time boarding with Rover,"So before going into my boarding experience over rover, I'd like to say that I boarded a family members dog not over Rover, and that was an utter nightmare. Unexpected separation anxiety, couldn't leave the dog alone for more than 3 minutes, and she was jealous of my baby. I had to seperate myself and the dog for 16 days to one side of the house (small room with a coffee table only to sit on, kitchen, back garden). I felt imprisoned in my own house, unable to see my kids, and it really took a toll on my mental health. I thought, I can't do this again.

But... I did lol.
I did a meet and greet with this gorgeous Akita mix, who didn't pull my arm off on the lead as they expected, and we agreed to do a one nighter. They said she'd been in a kennel overnight once since they got her, and the poor thing had a terrible time. So anxious she vomited, diarrhea and howled constantly when no one was by her side. So, they were fairly anxious to leave her with me because of this, but we still did. As forewarned, she did a nervous dump on my floor, and howled and barked for maybe thirty minutes, before she settled, and that was it. After that, beautiful, beautiful temperament. I was prepared to seperate her like I did with the other dog if she showed signs of jealousy around my kids, but it was nothing like that at all. She let my 1 year old boop her nose gently, and let my 6 year old cuddle with her on the couch. Such a relief to be able to spend time with my kids and the dog, she fit in perfectly, and the owners jokingly asked if they were ever gonna get her back. Needless to say, I got a lovely review, and had a wonderful time.",12,1754659205.0,RoverPetSitting,2,1.0,False
1mkv016,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1mkv016/find_out_if_the_arxus_travel_duffel_bag_is_worth/,Find Out if the Arxus Travel Duffel Bag is Worth Buying Review,"The Arxus Travel Lightweight Waterproof Duffel Bag (model B0754GYWCZ) instantly caught my attention with its promise of practicality and versatility. I‚Äôve used it multiple times in various scenarios‚Äîweekend getaways, gym visits, and as a backup carry-on during flights. This bag has an interesting mix of strengths and a few slight quirks, making it worth breaking down my experiences with it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This duffel‚Äôs design feels refreshingly simple yet sturdy. Made from lightweight yet durable nylon, it gave me confidence it could handle the rough-and-tumble of travel without easily tearing. I especially loved that this fabric is waterproof, which saved my stuff when my swim gear didn‚Äôt dry completely before being tossed inside. The structural integrity is commendable. Despite being feather-light at just 11.2 ounces, it can hold over 50 pounds without straining the fabric or zippers‚Äîwhich I can confirm after lugging my gym gear in it for weeks.

**Portability and Foldable Design**  
One feature that genuinely impressed me is the foldable design. When folded, it packs into a compact 7 x 7 x 1.5-inch square‚Äîsmall enough to throw in your suitcase or even stash in your handbag. Expanded, it offers a generous 25L capacity (dimensions: 18 x 12 x 6 inches), making it perfect as an emergency bag for extra shopping while traveling. I used it once as a spare bag for souvenirs during a trip, and the convenience factor cannot be overstated.  

[Check Arxus B0754GYWCZ price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b07569d1fl/)

**Ease of Use and Everyday Convenience**  
A feature that surprised me in its functionality was the clever luggage sleeve at the back. It slides over my suitcase handles perfectly, meaning no more awkwardly balancing an additional bag at the airport. The strap stays in place, and I could maneuver through terminals with one hand. I also appreciate the detachable shoulder strap, especially when my hands were full of coffee cups and boarding passes. As someone who hates digging through a deep, cluttered bag, the multiple pockets (two zippered and three mesh) were a lifesaver for keeping travel essentials organized. My passport, earphones, and snacks each had a dedicated spot, leaving the main compartment free for bulkier items like toiletries.

**Strengths**  
The advantages are numerous and made this bag a favorite for frequent use:  

- Lightweight yet durable construction ensures easy portability without compromising strength.  
- Thoughtful design elements like the luggage sleeve and multiple organizational pockets elevate its travel-friendliness.  
- Waterproof nylon material makes it suitable even for outdoor trips or gym sessions with wet clothes.  

**Weaknesses**  
Despite its impressive design, I did notice a few areas for improvement:

- While the bag feels sturdy, the zippers sometimes snag, an issue I‚Äôd encountered twice, especially when packed to full capacity.  
- It lacks structure when empty, meaning it can feel ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù when not entirely filled with items.  
- The shoulder strap‚Äôs padding is minimal, and if you‚Äôre carrying a heavier load, it can dig into your shoulders during long hauls.  

**Product Competitors**  
While the Arxus bag holds its own, similar products in the market do provide tough competition. I‚Äôve tried the Gonex Packable Travel Duffle, which shares a similar foldable feature but comes in larger sizes. While the Gonex wins in capacity, I found its stitching less resilient for everyday use compared to this duffel. Another rival, the Samsonite Tote-a-Ton, offers equally good durability but lacks the compact folding design that makes the Arxus bag so versatile. If you prioritize portability in your travel gear, this bag competes well with pricier options, even though it sits among budget-friendly alternatives.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, this duffel is pretty tough to beat. It delivers on the promise of versatility without breaking the bank. You‚Äôre getting a durable, lightweight, waterproof bag with smart organization options. Given its multifunctional use‚Äîfrom gym expeditions to weekend getaways‚Äîit feels worthy of investment. The foldable design is the cherry on top, making it a handy addition whether you‚Äôre a frequent traveler or just need an extra bag for emergencies.

almost no side effects from it. He tolerates it extremely well, only minor numbness in finger the first day after infusion (after that day no side effects). So far, he has received 3 infusions (on two week schedule) out of 6; than he will go more some examination to see if the treatment is ‚Äúbiting‚Äù.

My question is if FOLFOX will not be effective, what are the alternative cancer chemo treatment? FLOT?
What about HIPEC treatment?
Are there any other you are aware of?

I forgot I'd asked him to call. 

I forgot he'd promised he would.

The harsh buzz of notifications dragged me from sleep like claws. My phone's screen blazed angry white in the dim morning light.

I jolted upright, cursing myself for sleeping through Ray's call, fingers fumbling for the device when my bedroom door burst open without a knock.

My mother stood frozen in the doorway in her white cotton nightgown, backlit by the hallway light. She never came into my room without knocking first, not since I turned fifteen and demanded privacy. She stared at me with wide, hollow eyes that looked like they'd seen something terrible. Her face had drained of all colour.

""What is it, Mom?"" The words came out sharper than intended. My phone was still buzzing on the nightstand.

She remained silent, just standing there like a statue. I could see her hands shaking at her sides.

""Mom, what is it?"" This time I was yelling, panic creeping into my voice because she never acted like this.

My mother finally stepped closer on unsteady legs, reaching out to cup my face like I might disappear if she wasn't careful enough.

""Oh, Evelyn, my darling...""

Is she crying? Those were definitely tears, real tears streaming down her cheeks. My mother never cried. Not when Grandpa died, not ever in front of me.

A terrible thought struck me. ""Where's Dad? Did something happen to him? Is he okay?""

""Mom, what is it?"" I started to spiral, that familiar panic clawing up my throat. ""Why are you crying? Where's Da-""

Dad appeared in the doorway then, and he looked terrible. Unlike Mom's nightgown, he was fumbling with the buttons of his work shirt. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his hair was sticking up like he had been running his hands through it. He looked like he'd aged ten years overnight.

""Dad?"" The word came out strangled.

""I'll take her, Mary,"" he said gently, resting a protective hand on my mother's shoulder. His voice sounded hoarse, like he'd been talking all night. ""You should rest.""

""Take me where? What the hell is going on?!"" I never swore in front of my parents, but nothing about this morning was normal.

Dad's shoulders sagged like someone had piled rocks on them. When he spoke, he looked at the floor instead of at me. 

""Sweetheart... Ray had an accident last night. He wanted to see you before we need to go to the hospital.""

""What?!"" The word exploded from me. My phone vibrated off the nightstand and clattered to the floor. ""What do you mean Ray had an accident? What kind of accident? Is he okay? Tell me he's okay!""

""Yes, yes, he is,"" my mother rushed to say, but her voice was shaking and she was still crying, which didn't make any sense if he was okay. Her hands moved frantically through my hair. ""He is, dear. He is.""

""Then why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why are you both acting like this? What aren't you telling me, Dad?""

Dad looked at Mom, and something passed between them one of those silent conversations parents have when they're trying to protect you from something.

Dad said finally. ""We'll explain everything in the car.""

But they didn't explain anything in the car.

The drive to the hospital passed in heavy silence. Dad's knuckles were white against the steering wheel, and he kept checking the rearview mirror like he was afraid of something following us. Neither of us spoke every time I opened my mouth to ask a question, the look on his face stopped me.

I burst through the hospital's automatic doors, my sneakers squeaking against the polished floor. The smell hit me immediately cleaning supplies and something medicinal that made my nose burn. It was too bright inside, all fluorescent lights and white walls that hurt to look at.

""Which room is Raymond Cooper in?"" I demanded of the first nurse I saw, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and tired lines around her mouth.

My father's footsteps echoed behind me, and I could hear him breathing hard like he'd been running.

The nurse's face shifted when she heard Ray's name. Her expression became careful, professional. ""Are you family?""

""I'm his girlfriend. This is my dad."" The word 'girlfriend' felt, too small for what Ray and I actually were to each other.

She pointed toward the ICU with a gentle gesture that made my stomach drop. ""Third floor. But honey, you should speak with his family first. They're waiting up there.""

No. No, no, no.

The ICU was for serious things. Ray had an accident, but he was okay. Mom said he was okay.

The elevator ride to the third floor felt like it took forever. Dad stood beside me, his jaw clenched tight. I could see the muscle jumping underneath his skin.

""Dad,"" I whispered as we reached the third floor. ""What kind of accident?""

He looked at me with eyes that seemed older than they had been yesterday. ""Car accident, sweetheart.""

The elevator doors opened with a soft ding that sounded too cheerful for where we were.

Ray's family clustered outside the ICU like they'd been there all night. His mother was sobbing into his father's chest, not quite crying, but the kind of raw, choking sounds that come from somewhere deep inside. Her whole body shook with each breath. His father held her tight, his face buried in her hair, and his shoulders were trembling too.
Ray's little brother, Jake, sat in a plastic chair that was too big for him, his hands on his lap, his face red and swollen, and he looked so much smaller than the last time I'd seen him.

This wasn't right. None of this was right.

Ray's grandmother sat next to Jake, her weathered hands folded in her lap. She was the strong one in their family, the one who made everyone laugh at dinner and told stories about the old country. But now she looked ancient, like she'd collapsed if the breeze was a bit too strong.

I was an overthinker. Always had been. Always seeing disasters where there weren't any, making up worst-case scenarios in my head.

This was just another one of my spirals. Had to be.

We approached the family like we were walking underwater, everything slow and distorted.

Ray's uncle Tom, whose eyes usually crinkled when he smiled, stepped forward. Those same eyes were now red and hollow, like he hadn't slept in days.

""Hey, Eve..."" His voice was rough, unused.

""Ray,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Where is he? Can I see him? Are his injuries bad? What happened exactly? When did it happen? Why is everyone so upset if he's okay?""

Tom looked away, toward my dad, and I saw his eyes fill with fresh tears.

""Eve..."" His voice broke on my name like it was too heavy to say.

""He's in there, right?"" I pointed toward the ICU doors. ""I can see him, right? Did he break his legs? His arms? Is he unconscious? When will he wake up? Did they say when he'll wake up?""

The questions kept pouring out because if I stopped talking, if I let there be silence, then someone might tell me something I didn't want to hear.

""Ray broke his ribs, didn't he? That's why Mrs. Cooper is crying? Because it hurts and she doesn't like seeing him in pain? 
That's it, right?""

""Evelyn..."" Tom's voice was barely a whisper.

He swallowed hard, and I could see his throat working like he was trying not to throw up.

""Ray... Ray didn't make it, honey.""

The words hung in the air like smoke. I could see them, almost, floating between us, but they didn't make sense. They were in English, but they might as well have been in a foreign language.

I laughed.

It was a sound I'd never heard from myself before sharp and hollow and completely wrong.

""Oh. Oh! I'm dreaming, right? This is just a really bad dream,"" I heard myself say as something hot started running down my face. ""These dreams have been getting so realistic lately... It's crazy how real they feel...""

I spun toward my father and grabbed his shirt sleeve, bunching the fabric in my fists.

""Dad, you can wake me up, right? I'm sleeping upstairs in my bed, can you come wake me up? Please, Dad. I don't like this dream anymore. Please wake me up.""

""Oh, my darling,"" he whispered, wrapping his arms around me tight enough that I couldn't move. His voice sounded broken too. ""I'm here. I'm right here with you.""

But nothing was right. Ray was supposed to call me last night. Ray was supposed to pick me up at four this evening. We were supposed to go get coffee, find a poetry book for Adam, and go to the birthday party. Ray was supposed to be here, teasing me about the dress I was going to wear today, stealing sips of my coffee and complaining about having to accompany me to the bookstore on a Saturday.

""What happened?"" I asked against Dad's shirt, my voice muffled and strange. ""How did it happen?""

Tom cleared his throat. ""He‚Ä¶left early morning, saying he had an errand to run. Around five-thirty in the morning. A drunk driver ran a red light and hit him at the intersection on Pine Street.""

Pine Street. We'd walked past that intersection a thousand times. There was a stop sign there that was always crooked, and a pothole that Ray always swerved around because he was paranoid about his car.

""Was he..."" I couldn't finish the question.

""He died an hour before we called for you"" Tom said quietly.

I cried until my throat was raw, until my eyes were swollen shut, until there was nothing left inside me but an empty ache where my heart used to be. Dad held me the whole time, and I could feel him crying too, his tears falling into my hair.

Ray said he'd never leave me. He promised he'd be here even when I got old and lost my teeth. 

My Ray. My sun. The person who made everything brighter just by existing.

1mkux0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1mkux0e/the_hollow_hours/,The Hollow Hours,"Chapter 21 ‚Äì October 28th

Dennis woke before dawn, sitting upright on the edge of his bed. He didn‚Äôt remember getting there. His shirt was buttoned with mechanical precision ‚Äî every seam aligned, every fold sharp, as though ironed while on his body. His hands rested perfectly still in his lap, fingers interlaced, and his breathing was unnervingly even. He sat like that for several minutes before realizing he wasn‚Äôt choosing to. When he finally stood, his legs moved with smooth, practiced steps, like someone had rehearsed his walk for him.

The humming was back.

It pulsed faintly through the walls, not loud, but steady ‚Äî a low electrical vibration you could feel more in your teeth than your ears. He pressed his palm to the drywall, expecting nothing but the cold smoothness of paint. Instead, it was warm.

It was never warm.

Dennis followed the sound through the hall, the air carrying that faint metallic tang you get when wires overheat. Each step brought him closer to the noise until it grew into a layered thrum, almost alive. The trail led him to the far corner of the basement ‚Äî a place he rarely went because the ceiling there sloped so low you had to crouch.

Something was wrong with the wall itself.

Up close, the paint was‚Ä¶ different. Not the same shade. He ran a finger along it and felt a faint seam. The plaster here wasn‚Äôt plaster. With growing dread, he hooked his fingernails under the edge and pulled. A panel shifted, revealing a narrow cavity lit by a dull orange glow.

Inside was‚Ä¶ not wiring. Not anything recognizable.

Thin, metallic strands ran in precise, organic patterns, almost like veins, weaving into the wood studs. They pulsed faintly with light. From somewhere deep inside, a muffled click-click-click joined the hum, irregular but constant, like the sound of distant typing. Dennis‚Äôs stomach churned. This wasn‚Äôt machinery ‚Äî or at least, not any kind built for a house.

Then, his vision blinked.

It wasn‚Äôt a blackout ‚Äî not yet ‚Äî but the world flickered. One moment he was crouching in front of the cavity, the next he was in his kitchen, arranging silverware into perfect parallel lines. He hadn‚Äôt even felt himself move.

He gripped the counter to steady himself.

That‚Äôs when the knock came.

Trevor.

Dennis opened the door, half expecting ‚Äî half fearing ‚Äî to see the version of Trevor who smiled too easily, spoke too calmly. Instead, Trevor‚Äôs face looked more drawn, his eyes lined, almost‚Ä¶ human.

‚ÄúYou look like hell,‚Äù Trevor said quietly, glancing over Dennis‚Äôs shoulder as if checking for someone else.

‚ÄúI need answers,‚Äù Dennis said, voice cracking. ‚ÄúI found something in my walls. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not wires. It‚Äôs not plumbing. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs real. And the humming‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor held up a hand. ‚ÄúSlow down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt slow down, Trevor. Every time I think I‚Äôm doing something, I‚Äôm somewhere else. I wake up in the middle of it ‚Äî folding laundry, mowing the lawn, cleaning windows ‚Äî and everything is perfect. I‚Äôm not even aware I‚Äôm doing it. And when I try to leave‚Äî‚Äù He stopped, swallowing the lump in his throat. ‚ÄúI black out. I wake up here.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have gone looking in the walls.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it, Trevor?‚Äù

For a long time, Trevor didn‚Äôt answer. Then he sighed. ‚ÄúYou ever wonder why I‚Äôm the only one who talks to you like this? Why Lena still draws those pictures for you?‚Äù

Dennis‚Äôs breath caught. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre different.‚Äù

Trevor shook his head. ‚ÄúNot different enough.‚Äù He stepped inside, shutting the door behind him. ‚ÄúI came here years ago. I thought I was moving to a place where everything worked, where people cared. That‚Äôs how it starts. They make it easy to stop questioning. They make you want to fit in. The rest happens on its own.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rest?‚Äù

Trevor glanced toward the hallway, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúThe integration. Once it finishes, you stop noticing what‚Äôs wrong. You stop wanting to leave. And you stop‚Ä¶ being you.‚Äù

Dennis felt the air leave his lungs. ‚ÄúThen why are you still you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúNot entirely.‚Äù

Before Dennis could press him, something in his vision went black.

When it came back, he was standing at the kitchen sink, scrubbing a glass in slow, perfect circles. The counter was spotless. His breathing was even again. Trevor was still talking ‚Äî mid-sentence ‚Äî but Dennis hadn‚Äôt heard what came before.

‚Äú‚Ä¶and if you keep pushing, they‚Äôll finish it sooner.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting them‚Äî‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice broke. ‚ÄúTrevor, the walls. The humming. What is it?‚Äù

Trevor looked at him with a strange mixture of pity and warning. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open it again. It‚Äôs not for you to understand.‚Äù

Dennis‚Äôs nails dug into the countertop. ‚ÄúThen tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Trevor said simply. ‚ÄúSome things don‚Äôt belong to us anymore.‚Äù

The thrum in the walls swelled ‚Äî louder now, almost rhythmic. For a dizzy second, Dennis thought he could hear faint voices under it, like dozens of people murmuring in a language he couldn‚Äôt place.

He closed his eyes.

When he opened them again, the sun was lower in the sky. Trevor was gone. His house was immaculate. And his hands were folded neatly in his lap, just like that morning.


Chapter 22 ‚Äì October 29th

The hum had changed.

It was no longer the soft, background vibration Dennis had once been able to ignore. Now it carried a rhythm, like a mechanical heartbeat ‚Äî low, steady, and deliberate. And layered under it, in the stillness between pulses, were whispers. Not words exactly, but the suggestion of them.

He hadn‚Äôt slept. The sound filled the house, seeping through walls, floors, and the very air. Every now and then, the pulse would slow, then speed up, as though tracking something inside him.

By morning, Dennis knew ‚Äî without reason or proof ‚Äî that if he stayed another day, it would finish whatever it had started.

He called Trevor.

Trevor arrived faster than he should have been able to, stepping inside like he‚Äôd been waiting nearby. He didn‚Äôt smile. His eyes went to the corners of the room, to the walls, as though he could see the hum.

‚ÄúI need you to come with me,‚Äù Dennis said, pacing. ‚ÄúWe leave now. We get in my car and we don‚Äôt stop until‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve tried before,‚Äù Trevor interrupted, voice low.

‚ÄúNot with you. You know things. Maybe you can‚Äî‚Äù Dennis stopped, his throat tight. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it alone. And if you stay here, you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ waiting for it to happen.‚Äù

Trevor studied him for a long, unblinking moment. ‚ÄúIt already happened to me, Dennis.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen help me before it happens to me.‚Äù

A muscle in Trevor‚Äôs jaw twitched. He looked toward the kitchen, where the hum seemed thickest. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try.‚Äù

Dennis grabbed his keys, his hands trembling. The car felt foreign when they slid inside, as if it had been cleaned by someone who didn‚Äôt understand it ‚Äî no dust, no smell of him, just sterile perfection.

The streets of Grayer Ridge were empty, though the houses stood pristine as ever. Curtains hung straight, lawns unblemished, no one visible. It was a ghost town wearing the skin of a neighborhood.

The first turn came without incident. Then the second. Dennis kept his eyes on the horizon, where the road seemed to shimmer faintly in the autumn air. The hum was still in his head, but softer now, as if muffled.

Trevor sat rigid in the passenger seat.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll notice,‚Äù Trevor murmured.

‚ÄúLet them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey always notice.‚Äù

A shadow crossed the road ‚Äî not a person, not an animal, just‚Ä¶ a shift, like something massive had passed unseen. Dennis gripped the wheel tighter, trying to ignore it.

Half a mile later, the air felt heavier. The houses thinned. The trees along the roadside looked wrong ‚Äî each leaf perfectly in place, every branch balanced, no sign of wind despite the occasional movement.

Then the world blinked.

One second they were rolling toward the edge of town, the next Dennis was parked in front of his own house, the engine idling. His knuckles were white on the wheel.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was the easy part,‚Äù Trevor said flatly.

Dennis‚Äôs breathing grew rapid. ‚ÄúNo. No, I‚Äôm not stopping.‚Äù He threw the car into reverse and backed out again.

This time they made it farther ‚Äî almost to the gas station at the edge of Grayer Ridge ‚Äî when Dennis‚Äôs vision folded in on itself. Not a fade, not a blur ‚Äî just gone, like a page torn from a book.

When he came to, he was walking up his porch steps, keys in hand, Trevor behind him like nothing had happened.

Dennis spun. ‚ÄúYou saw that. You saw what they did!‚Äù

Trevor didn‚Äôt answer immediately. His gaze drifted past Dennis, toward the street. ‚ÄúEvery road here leads back. You can‚Äôt outrun the center.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you think is possible!‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice cracked, his chest tight. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying again.‚Äù

Trevor sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt understand. The roads aren‚Äôt the only thing pulling you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs eyes met his. ‚ÄúPart of you is already here. The rest just hasn‚Äôt caught up.‚Äù

The hum surged through the ground beneath them. Dennis swore he felt it in his bones. The air thickened, his thoughts scattering.

Another blackout.

This time, when he woke, he was sitting in Trevor‚Äôs living room, a cup of tea in his hand, the steam curling upward. He didn‚Äôt remember making it. He didn‚Äôt remember sitting down. Trevor was across from him, Lena absent ‚Äî her absence heavier than her presence ever was.

‚ÄúYou see why it‚Äôs harder the closer you get,‚Äù Trevor said softly.

Dennis set the cup down, his hands shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving up.‚Äù

Trevor gave a small, tired smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I said.‚Äù

The hum rose again, drowning out the silence between them.



Chapter 23‚Äì October 29th

The hum was no longer in the walls ‚Äî it was in him.

Dennis woke that morning to find it thrumming in his chest, pulsing behind his eyes. Each vibration seemed to pull the room in tighter, as if the walls were breathing with him. He could feel it in the bones of the floor, in the metal of the doorknob, even in the cool air between his teeth when he breathed.

He didn‚Äôt have time left. He knew it.

Trevor showed up without being called, leaning in the doorway with that unreadable look. His eyes tracked something invisible along the ceiling before landing on Dennis.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù Dennis said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said that before.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis time you‚Äôre coming with me.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs lips pressed into a thin line. ‚ÄúIf you think that changes anything‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I can‚Äôt do this alone.‚Äù

A silence stretched between them. Then Trevor gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. ‚ÄúFine. But don‚Äôt blame me when we‚Äôre right back here.‚Äù

The streets were too clean, too symmetrical as they drove. Every mailbox straight. Every trash can perfectly aligned. No one in sight.

At first, the hum receded with distance, like static falling away. Dennis‚Äôs shoulders eased. Maybe, this time‚Äî

The road ahead shimmered faintly, as though heat warped the air despite the cool October morning.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look too long,‚Äù Trevor muttered.

Half a mile later, the air grew heavy. The gas station ‚Äî the same one from his last attempt ‚Äî came into view. The hum began to rise again, almost impatient now.

And then‚Äî

Black.

Dennis came to parked in front of his own house, engine idling. His heart thundered, the hum roaring in sync with it.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dennis whispered. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs voice was calm. ‚ÄúThat was the easy part.‚Äù

Dennis threw the car into gear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying again.‚Äù

They made it farther this time ‚Äî past the station, past the faded ‚ÄúLeaving Grayer Ridge‚Äù sign.

The world bent.

The next thing Dennis knew, he was on his porch steps, keys in hand, Trevor behind him.

‚ÄúYou saw that!‚Äù Dennis shouted.

Trevor looked almost sad. ‚ÄúEvery road leads back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice broke. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWait why does this seem like I‚Äôve already been through this‚Äù Dennis wondered 

The hum surged up from the ground like a wave. The sky went gray.

Black.

‚∏ª

Dennis woke to warmth.

A soft blanket over him. The faint smell of coffee. The quiet murmur of morning news on the TV.

He blinked, his chest tight ‚Äî and there she was.

Allie. His ex-wife. Sitting on the edge of the bed, hair pulled into the messy bun he remembered, smiling like nothing had ever happened.

‚ÄúYou were talking in your sleep again,‚Äù she teased. ‚ÄúSomething about‚Ä¶ perfect lawns?‚Äù

Dennis sat up slowly. The walls ‚Äî they were their old apartment‚Äôs walls. No hum. No impossible symmetry. No Grayer Ridge.

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúIt was just this crazy dream. A town. Too perfect. People who weren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ right.‚Äù

Her hand found his. ‚ÄúSounds awful.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was.‚Äù He leaned forward, pressing his forehead to hers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

And for weeks, it was.

Thanksgiving came. He saw his family. He laughed. The air was never too still. The days never vanished. And he stopped thinking about Grayer Ridge altogether.

‚∏ª

December 15th

The moving truck looked too big for the narrow streets, but the driver maneuvered it carefully to the neat little house at the corner.

Elliot and Marissa Lane had only just arrived in Grayer Ridge that morning, and already the place seemed too‚Ä¶ polished. Not in a bad way, not exactly ‚Äî but every hedge looked trimmed by the same hand, every driveway spotless.

They spent the afternoon unpacking, then decided to meet the neighbors.

Most answered quickly, smiling, welcoming them in that warm-but-slightly-scripted way small towns often did. There was Mrs. Halbrook with her plate of sugar cookies, the Whitehursts with their overly excited golden retriever.

As the sun dipped, they approached the last house on the block.

The porch light was on, the paint flawless. No cars in the drive.

Marissa knocked.

The door opened.

A man stood there ‚Äî tall, neatly dressed, posture straight. His smile was‚Ä¶ perfect. Not too wide, not too small. Just right.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said warmly. ‚ÄúWelcome to the neighborhood. I‚Äôm Dennis.‚Äù

The handshake was firm, practiced. His eyes didn‚Äôt leave theirs, not for a second.

Something about the precision of it all prickled at the back of Elliot‚Äôs neck.

Marissa returned the smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Elliot and Marissa. Just moved in down the street.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs wonderful,‚Äù Dennis said, voice smooth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find Grayer Ridge to be‚Ä¶ exactly what you need.‚Äù

Footsteps approached behind him. Another man emerged from the hallway ‚Äî broad-shouldered, relaxed, with eyes that seemed to look through you.

Trevor.

He clapped a hand on Dennis‚Äôs shoulder, smiling at the couple.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be happy here. We always are.‚Äù

And for a moment, it felt less like a greeting and more like a fact.

Dennis held their gaze for a moment longer, watching the faint flicker in their expressions ‚Äî the same flicker he once had.

1mkuwyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenagersButBetter/comments/1mkuwyx/2nd_part_of_a_story_im_writing_rest_on_my_profile/,2nd part of a story I'm writing (rest on my profile),"I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, Ray's promise to call still warm in my ears.

I forgot I'd asked him to call. 

I forgot he'd promised he would.

The harsh buzz of notifications dragged me from sleep like claws. My phone's screen blazed angry white in the dim morning light.

I jolted upright, cursing myself for sleeping through Ray's call, fingers fumbling for the device when my bedroom door burst open without a knock.

My mother stood frozen in the doorway in her white cotton nightgown, backlit by the hallway light. She never came into my room without knocking first, not since I turned fifteen and demanded privacy. She stared at me with wide, hollow eyes that looked like they'd seen something terrible. Her face had drained of all colour.

""What is it, Mom?"" The words came out sharper than intended. My phone was still buzzing on the nightstand.

She remained silent, just standing there like a statue. I could see her hands shaking at her sides.

""Mom, what is it?"" This time I was yelling, panic creeping into my voice because she never acted like this.

My mother finally stepped closer on unsteady legs, reaching out to cup my face like I might disappear if she wasn't careful enough.

""Oh, Evelyn, my darling...""

Is she crying? Those were definitely tears, real tears streaming down her cheeks. My mother never cried. Not when Grandpa died, not ever in front of me.

A terrible thought struck me. ""Where's Dad? Did something happen to him? Is he okay?""

""Mom, what is it?"" I started to spiral, that familiar panic clawing up my throat. ""Why are you crying? Where's Da-""

Dad appeared in the doorway then, and he looked terrible. Unlike Mom's nightgown, he was fumbling with the buttons of his work shirt. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his hair was sticking up like he had been running his hands through it. He looked like he'd aged ten years overnight.

""Dad?"" The word came out strangled.

""I'll take her, Mary,"" he said gently, resting a protective hand on my mother's shoulder. His voice sounded hoarse, like he'd been talking all night. ""You should rest.""

""Take me where? What the hell is going on?!"" I never swore in front of my parents, but nothing about this morning was normal.

Dad's shoulders sagged like someone had piled rocks on them. When he spoke, he looked at the floor instead of at me. 

""Sweetheart... Ray had an accident last night. He wanted to see you before we need to go to the hospital.""

""What?!"" The word exploded from me. My phone vibrated off the nightstand and clattered to the floor. ""What do you mean Ray had an accident? What kind of accident? Is he okay? Tell me he's okay!""

""Yes, yes, he is,"" my mother rushed to say, but her voice was shaking and she was still crying, which didn't make any sense if he was okay. Her hands moved frantically through my hair. ""He is, dear. He is.""

""Then why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why are you both acting like this? What aren't you telling me, Dad?""

Dad looked at Mom, and something passed between them one of those silent conversations parents have when they're trying to protect you from something.

Dad said finally. ""We'll explain everything in the car.""

But they didn't explain anything in the car.

The drive to the hospital passed in heavy silence. Dad's knuckles were white against the steering wheel, and he kept checking the rearview mirror like he was afraid of something following us. Neither of us spoke every time I opened my mouth to ask a question, the look on his face stopped me.

I burst through the hospital's automatic doors, my sneakers squeaking against the polished floor. The smell hit me immediately cleaning supplies and something medicinal that made my nose burn. It was too bright inside, all fluorescent lights and white walls that hurt to look at.

""Which room is Raymond Cooper in?"" I demanded of the first nurse I saw, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and tired lines around her mouth.

My father's footsteps echoed behind me, and I could hear him breathing hard like he'd been running.

The nurse's face shifted when she heard Ray's name. Her expression became careful, professional. ""Are you family?""

""I'm his girlfriend. This is my dad."" The word 'girlfriend' felt, too small for what Ray and I actually were to each other.

She pointed toward the ICU with a gentle gesture that made my stomach drop. ""Third floor. But honey, you should speak with his family first. They're waiting up there.""

No. No, no, no.

The ICU was for serious things. Ray had an accident, but he was okay. Mom said he was okay.

The elevator ride to the third floor felt like it took forever. Dad stood beside me, his jaw clenched tight. I could see the muscle jumping underneath his skin.

""Dad,"" I whispered as we reached the third floor. ""What kind of accident?""

He looked at me with eyes that seemed older than they had been yesterday. ""Car accident, sweetheart.""

The elevator doors opened with a soft ding that sounded too cheerful for where we were.

Ray's family clustered outside the ICU like they'd been there all night. His mother was sobbing into his father's chest, not quite crying, but the kind of raw, choking sounds that come from somewhere deep inside. Her whole body shook with each breath. His father held her tight, his face buried in her hair, and his shoulders were trembling too.
Ray's little brother, Jake, sat in a plastic chair that was too big for him, his hands on his lap, his face red and swollen, and he looked so much smaller than the last time I'd seen him.

This wasn't right. None of this was right.

Ray's grandmother sat next to Jake, her weathered hands folded in her lap. She was the strong one in their family, the one who made everyone laugh at dinner and told stories about the old country. But now she looked ancient, like she'd collapsed if the breeze was a bit too strong.

I was an overthinker. Always had been. Always seeing disasters where there weren't any, making up worst-case scenarios in my head.

This was just another one of my spirals. Had to be.

We approached the family like we were walking underwater, everything slow and distorted.

Ray's uncle Tom, whose eyes usually crinkled when he smiled, stepped forward. Those same eyes were now red and hollow, like he hadn't slept in days.

""Hey, Eve..."" His voice was rough, unused.

""Ray,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Where is he? Can I see him? Are his injuries bad? What happened exactly? When did it happen? Why is everyone so upset if he's okay?""

Tom looked away, toward my dad, and I saw his eyes fill with fresh tears.

""Eve..."" His voice broke on my name like it was too heavy to say.

""He's in there, right?"" I pointed toward the ICU doors. ""I can see him, right? Did he break his legs? His arms? Is he unconscious? When will he wake up? Did they say when he'll wake up?""

The questions kept pouring out because if I stopped talking, if I let there be silence, then someone might tell me something I didn't want to hear.

""Ray broke his ribs, didn't he? That's why Mrs. Cooper is crying? Because it hurts and she doesn't like seeing him in pain? 
That's it, right?""

""Evelyn..."" Tom's voice was barely a whisper.

He swallowed hard, and I could see his throat working like he was trying not to throw up.

""Ray... Ray didn't make it, honey.""

The words hung in the air like smoke. I could see them, almost, floating between us, but they didn't make sense. They were in English, but they might as well have been in a foreign language.

I laughed.

It was a sound I'd never heard from myself before sharp and hollow and completely wrong.

""Oh. Oh! I'm dreaming, right? This is just a really bad dream,"" I heard myself say as something hot started running down my face. ""These dreams have been getting so realistic lately... It's crazy how real they feel...""

I spun toward my father and grabbed his shirt sleeve, bunching the fabric in my fists.

""Dad, you can wake me up, right? I'm sleeping upstairs in my bed, can you come wake me up? Please, Dad. I don't like this dream anymore. Please wake me up.""

""Oh, my darling,"" he whispered, wrapping his arms around me tight enough that I couldn't move. His voice sounded broken too. ""I'm here. I'm right here with you.""

But nothing was right. Ray was supposed to call me last night. Ray was supposed to pick me up at four this evening. We were supposed to go get coffee, find a poetry book for Adam, and go to the birthday party. Ray was supposed to be here, teasing me about the dress I was going to wear today, stealing sips of my coffee and complaining about having to accompany me to the bookstore on a Saturday.

""What happened?"" I asked against Dad's shirt, my voice muffled and strange. ""How did it happen?""

Tom cleared his throat. ""He‚Ä¶left early morning, saying he had an errand to run. Around five-thirty in the morning. A drunk driver ran a red light and hit him at the intersection on Pine Street.""

Pine Street. We'd walked past that intersection a thousand times. There was a stop sign there that was always crooked, and a pothole that Ray always swerved around because he was paranoid about his car.

""Was he..."" I couldn't finish the question.

""He died an hour before we called for you"" Tom said quietly.

I cried until my throat was raw, until my eyes were swollen shut, until there was nothing left inside me but an empty ache where my heart used to be. Dad held me the whole time, and I could feel him crying too, his tears falling into my hair.

Ray said he'd never leave me. He promised he'd be here even when I got old and lost my teeth. 

My Ray. My sun. The person who made everything brighter just by existing.

Gone.

October 3rd ‚Äì 9:42 PM

Dennis sat on the bathroom floor, his shirt damp with sweat despite the chill from the tile. The mirror above the sink was fogged, even though he didn‚Äôt remember taking a shower. A towel lay crumpled on the floor beside him. Damp. Used.

But he didn‚Äôt remember using it.

His hair was wet. The smell of some herbal soap clung faintly to his arms, but it wasn‚Äôt the kind he‚Äôd bought. There was an open toothbrush on the counter‚Äîbristles still wet, toothpaste cap missing.

None of it made sense.

The clock ticked on the wall, louder than it should have. It filled the silence like a metronome, rhythmic, pulsing in sync with something in his chest.

He blinked and looked down. A note had been slipped under the bathroom door.

Folded neatly. No name. No handwriting on the outside.

Inside, a short phrase printed in narrow black ink:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time.‚Äù

No context. No explanation. He didn‚Äôt know how long it had been there.

‚∏ª

October 4th ‚Äì 11:10 AM

Trevor wasn‚Äôt home that morning. But Lena was outside again, drawing on the sidewalk with chalk. She looked up at Dennis as he passed and handed him a piece of paper without a word.

A drawing. Of his house again.

Only the windows were blacked out. Every one of them. Not shaded, not scribbled‚Äîblacked out with such dense charcoal that the paper crinkled from the pressure.

Above the roof: a narrow, long shape, like a tower. Or a spire. Twisting. Out of proportion.

Dennis felt it immediately‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there.

The shape seemed to hum in the back of his brain.

‚∏ª

October 5th ‚Äì 12:34 AM

He laid out every drawing Lena had given him on his living room floor. Over a dozen now, each more frantic than the last.

A spiraling staircase that descended into a single dark room.

A face behind his kitchen window. No eyes, no mouth‚Äîjust pale skin.

A long corridor with doors on either side‚Äîbut no walls to hold them.

At first, they seemed like children‚Äôs nonsense.

But the longer he stared, the more they looked like‚Ä¶ instructions.

Patterns.

Each one contained recurring symbols‚Äîa circle with a vertical slash through it. Sometimes tucked in corners. Other times embedded in the drawings like part of the architecture.

He started cataloging them, trying to connect the pieces. But nothing held.

The shapes shifted. Not literally, but perceptually.

One night, he thought he saw a floorplan across three different pages. The next morning, the lines looked wrong again‚Äîtoo abstract. Too fragmented.

Like trying to read an unfamiliar language mid-sentence.

‚∏ª

October 6th ‚Äì 1:37 AM

He went to Trevor‚Äôs again.

The door opened slowly. Trevor blinked at him, wearing a calm expression, but something behind his eyes looked dull, unfocused.

Dennis stepped inside.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúYou look like you haven‚Äôt slept.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to talk about it?‚Äù

Dennis sat down on the couch, rubbing his face.

‚ÄúDo you ever feel like‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not driving the car? Like something else is deciding for you?‚Äù

Trevor tilted his head, like the question was strange but not unexpected.

‚ÄúI think everyone feels that way sometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen they‚Äôre stressed.‚Äù

Dennis hesitated. Trevor‚Äôs voice was kind. Familiar. The kind you trust.

But his body didn‚Äôt match. His fingers drummed out an odd rhythm on the armrest. His feet shifted like they wanted to leave.

Dennis caught a glimpse of Lena‚Äôs latest drawing on the coffee table. He hadn‚Äôt brought it here.

‚ÄúWas this yours?‚Äù Dennis asked.

Trevor glanced at it. ‚ÄúNo. Looks like Lena‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I had it. At home. On my kitchen table.‚Äù

Trevor shrugged. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always drawing. Maybe she made another one.‚Äù

Dennis stared at the page.

It was identical.

‚∏ª

October 7th ‚Äì 10:01 AM

Dennis tried leaving town.

Not far. Just to the next city.

He got on the highway. Watched the welcome sign disappear in the rearview mirror.

Then blinked.

And he was sitting on his couch. A cup of tea in his hand. Warm.

The TV was on‚Äîsome old movie he didn‚Äôt remember starting.

No missed calls. No proof of the drive. Just the scent of asphalt and motor oil faintly on his shirt.

‚∏ª

October 8th ‚Äì 9:17 PM

The drawings wouldn‚Äôt leave him alone.

He tried correlating the symbols‚Äîmapping their positions, overlaying them with tracing paper. For a few moments, a logic seemed to emerge: doorways, paths, movement patterns.

But it broke down again the second he looked away.

When he returned to the floor, nothing aligned. He could swear some drawings had changed position.

He flipped the paper over. Held it to the light. Rubbed the edges. Some lines looked newer. Sharper. As if added recently.

But he hadn‚Äôt touched them.

And the more he stared‚Äîthe more certain he became:

The drawings were reacting to him.

Not with movement. Not with animation. But with disobedience.

He wasn‚Äôt interpreting them wrong.

They were designed to mislead him.

‚∏ª

October 9th ‚Äì 2:55 AM

He sat alone, floor cluttered with pages, spiraling in silent dread.

The symbols meant something.

But they refused to stay still.

He tried translating them again. Convinced himself they were architectural‚Äîblueprints for some hidden structure.

Then he saw it.

The same house. His house.

Drawn in impossible configurations. A second floor that didn‚Äôt exist. A hall that curved into itself. A room where the staircase should be.

He flipped another sheet.

The house again‚Äîbut buried, surrounded by scribbles like roots, or tunnels, or veins.

He felt it then‚Äîlike a migraine in his soul.

They weren‚Äôt drawings.

They were instructions.

For what?

He didn‚Äôt know.

Only that it was getting harder to remember what Lena looked like.

And when he tried to picture Trevor‚Äî

He couldn‚Äôt remember if he‚Äôd ever seen him blink.



Chapter 17: The Shape of Normal

October 18th ‚Äî 7:09 AM

Dennis found himself scrubbing the kitchen sink.

The sponge moved in steady, even circles‚Äîperfect clockwise loops, no wasted motion. The citrus smell of bleach and lemon was sharp in his nose, clean in a sterile, hotel-lobby kind of way.

The faucet gleamed. No spots. No grime. He had aligned the soap bottle‚Äôs label perfectly toward the front of the counter, next to a folded towel‚Äîcreased precisely, corners symmetrical.

He blinked.

Snapped out of it.

His heart kicked.

He didn‚Äôt remember starting. Didn‚Äôt know why he was doing it.

His hands trembled as he dropped the sponge into the basin.

He backed away from the counter, eyes scanning the kitchen like it might accuse him.

He hadn‚Äôt cleaned like this since‚Ä¶ ever.

It wasn‚Äôt just the cleaning‚Äîit was how perfect it looked. Like he‚Äôd staged the room for a real estate photo. His body had moved on its own. His limbs had remembered what his brain did not.

And worse‚Äîhe liked how it looked.

That disturbed him most of all.

‚∏ª

October 18th ‚Äî 10:41 AM

Main Street.

The sky was a little too blue.

The clouds above looked computer-rendered‚Äîlight and puffy, placed almost mathematically apart. The breeze was the perfect chill. Leaves scattered just enough for charm but never mess. A seasonal decoration on every door.

Dennis‚Äôs boots hit the pavement in a rhythm that didn‚Äôt feel like his own.

He passed the bakery. The same three croissants sat in the window as they had for the last five days. Not stale, not fresh. Unchanging.

The barber across the street was trimming the same man‚Äôs hair as last week‚Äîsame haircut, same angle, same smile between snips.

Dennis tried asking people questions.

‚ÄúWhat year did you move here?‚Äù he asked the mailman.

‚ÄúLong enough ago,‚Äù the man replied, still smiling. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs settled now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember who lived in the white house before the Petersons?‚Äù

The woman watering plastic flowers paused just slightly.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always been Petersons,‚Äù she said without turning.

He stopped by the church, then the small pharmacy. Asked more questions. Each answer made less sense. Details didn‚Äôt line up. Dates changed. Names reversed. Faces looked familiar and unfamiliar at once, like a dream he‚Äôd had too many times to know what was real anymore.

His body itched to go home and clean something. He resisted.

But his feet didn‚Äôt take him home.

They took him there.

‚∏ª

October 18th ‚Äî 2:12 PM

Trevor‚Äôs house sat quiet.

Not abandoned. Just too quiet.

The lawn was too short. Not a blade out of place. The mailbox was dustless. No newspapers stacked. No toys in the yard.

Dennis hesitated at the front door.

He knocked once.

Trevor opened it before the second knock landed.

He smiled. ‚ÄúDennis. You alright?‚Äù

Dennis swallowed.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ yeah. I think. I just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù Trevor said.

Inside was unchanged. The scent of strong coffee. Lena‚Äôs scribbles still clinging to the fridge, but fewer now. Fewer than he remembered.

The living room was immaculately staged. Nothing out of place. Nothing warm.

Lena sat on the floor with a blank sheet of paper.

Not drawing.

Just staring at the pencil.

‚ÄúHey, Lena,‚Äù Dennis said softly.

She looked up and smiled.

But didn‚Äôt speak.

No drawing. No silent handoff. No cryptic art today.

Dennis frowned. ‚ÄúNo drawing today?‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs voice came from behind him. ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt really drawn in a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not true,‚Äù Dennis said, turning. ‚ÄúShe gave me one just a few days ago.‚Äù

Trevor gave a slow, warm blink. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôd remember.‚Äù

Dennis studied him.

Everything in Trevor‚Äôs posture was calm. Too calm. His hands folded like a therapist. His voice unhurried. Like this was a conversation they‚Äôd rehearsed before he arrived.

Dennis looked back at Lena.

She was still smiling. Still not moving.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù Dennis muttered.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Trevor said gently.

Dennis turned to him, his voice harder now. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening to me?‚Äù

Trevor didn‚Äôt answer at first.

He poured tea into two cups.

Not coffee.

When he handed it over, his hand lingered on Dennis‚Äôs shoulder a little too long.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying too hard,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúYou keep digging and fighting and chasing things that don‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù

Dennis stared at the tea.

Steam rising. No reflection in it.

Trevor continued. ‚ÄúWhat if you just‚Ä¶ stopped? Let it go. Let it settle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it I‚Äôm supposed to let go?‚Äù Dennis asked. ‚ÄúThe truth? My memories? You?‚Äù

Trevor took a deep breath. ‚ÄúEverything, Dennis. It will work out in due time.‚Äù

Dennis laughed, but it came out wrong. Hysterical. Empty.

‚ÄúYou sound like everyone else,‚Äù he said, voice thin.

Trevor‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt break.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI care about you. I always have. You‚Äôre making this harder than it needs to be.‚Äù

Lena stood then.

She walked slowly out of the room.

No drawing. Not even a glance.

Dennis sat there with the tea growing colder in his hands, heart pounding, unsure if the friend he once trusted was someone he ever really knew.

‚∏ª

October 18th ‚Äî 6:46 PM

At home, Dennis stared at the newest note on his fridge.

He hadn‚Äôt written it.

He didn‚Äôt know when it appeared.

But it was his handwriting.

‚ÄúConform. Or forget.‚Äù

The lights in the house flickered.

No‚Äîdimmed.

His reflection in the darkened glass of the microwave didn‚Äôt match his movements for a half-second.

And when he turned to leave the room, he caught himself smiling.

Too wide.

Too long.

Like the others.

Like them all.



Chapter 18: The Shape of the Answer

October 20th ‚Äî 4:41 AM

Dennis awoke in the living room.

He wasn‚Äôt lying down. He was sitting up ‚Äî back straight, hands folded neatly in his lap, like he‚Äôd been waiting.

The TV was on. Static filled the screen, but there was no sound. Just a faint vibration in the floorboards, as if the house itself was humming beneath him.

He had no memory of walking here. No dream he could recall. He had gone to bed sometime around 10:30 ‚Äî he was sure of that. Brushed his teeth. Turned off the lights. Laid down.

But now‚Ä¶ his shirt was tucked in. His sleeves rolled. His hair was combed back like he was expecting company.

A glass of water sat on the table.

Half empty.

His own handwriting on a note beneath it:

‚ÄúStay calm. Let it finish.‚Äù

‚∏ª

October 20th ‚Äî 10:16 AM

Dennis stood outside the town archives again. The librarian gave him that same flawless smile ‚Äî the one that always seemed painted on.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for old records,‚Äù Dennis said, trying to steady his voice. ‚ÄúHouse registrations. Ownership transfers. Anything on the McKenna family or Trevor Lang.‚Äù

Her smile didn‚Äôt falter. ‚ÄúThat name doesn‚Äôt appear in the system, Mr. Calloway.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt did before,‚Äù Dennis said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read it here. You let me look at them.‚Äù

She tilted her head just slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre mistaken.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù he stopped himself. Arguing never worked in this place.

The shelves behind her looked different today. Not just rearranged ‚Äî rebuilt. As if someone had taken the original layout and recreated it from memory‚Ä¶ but slightly off. Too many blue binders. Too few dust jackets. Labels typed in a font Dennis didn‚Äôt recognize.

He walked the aisles. Touched spines that felt thinner than they should. He pulled a familiar book off the shelf ‚Äî one he remembered flipping through weeks ago.

Inside, all the pages were blank.

‚∏ª

October 22nd ‚Äî 3:00 PM

Dennis walked down Main Street, hoping for something solid ‚Äî anything. But the signs on the buildings had changed again. The hardware store was now ‚ÄúHandy Town,‚Äù and the pharmacy had turned into a smiling pastel box labeled only ‚ÄúCare.‚Äù

He passed the bench where the old lady usually sat ‚Äî the one who fed imaginary birds. Today, she just stared ahead, eyes blank.

But her lips moved, whispering something.

Dennis crouched beside her. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt blink.

‚ÄúDid you say something?‚Äù

She smiled.

Whispered it again.

Dennis leaned in closer.

‚ÄúThe ones who remember always break.‚Äù

‚∏ª

October 22nd ‚Äî 6:34 PM

Trevor answered the door before Dennis even knocked.

‚ÄúYou look tired,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCome in. I‚Äôve got tea on.‚Äù

Inside, the house was colder than usual. There were fewer pictures on the walls now ‚Äî some of the empty frames still hung there, as if the memories had been plucked out.

Lena was sitting at the table, coloring with a red crayon. Just one crayon. Just red. Her hands moved slowly, methodically. She didn‚Äôt look up.

Dennis sat across from her. ‚ÄúWhat are you drawing?‚Äù

She pushed the page toward him wordlessly.

It was a tangle of lines at first. Dense and chaotic. But the more he looked, the more patterns emerged ‚Äî faces hidden in the intersections, buildings shaped like letters, a figure that might‚Äôve been himself standing on a street that didn‚Äôt exist.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù he whispered.

Lena didn‚Äôt answer. She was already drawing another one.

Trevor set the tea down. ‚ÄúYou need to stop chasing this,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hurting you.‚Äù

Dennis didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù He tapped the drawing, his breath quickening. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

Trevor placed a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúNot everything makes sense, Dennis. That‚Äôs not a flaw. It‚Äôs a kindness.‚Äù

Dennis jerked away. ‚ÄúSo you do know what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôre breaking yourself in two trying to put it all together,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúLet it go. Just let it be.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Dennis muttered. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt pretend this is normal. You‚Ä¶ you vanished. Your house moved. Everyone changed. And I changed. I‚Äôm not even me anymore.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs eyes softened ‚Äî not sad, not afraid. Something else. Like pity.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre adapting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust slower than the rest.‚Äù

‚∏ª

October 25th‚Äî 2:03 AM

Dennis woke in his backyard.

It was raining, but he was dry.

He looked down. He was in new clothes ‚Äî khakis and a navy polo. There was a badge pinned to his chest: ‚ÄúNeighborhood Coordinator.‚Äù

He tore it off.

The porch light flickered when he stepped inside. In the mirror by the door, his face looked exactly like his father‚Äôs. But only for a second.

He stumbled to the kitchen. Another note on the fridge, in the same handwriting as before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting there. Stay still.‚Äù

He threw it across the room.

‚∏ª

October 25th ‚Äî 11:44 AM

Back at Trevor‚Äôs again.

Dennis sat on the edge of the couch, the new drawing in his lap. He tried comparing it to Lena‚Äôs others ‚Äî he‚Äôd brought them in a folder now, each marked and numbered.

Lines connected in impossible ways. Some formed outlines of symbols he‚Äôd seen before ‚Äî on the note, on the sticker, even carved faintly into the bottom of his own coffee mug.

Some lines moved the longer he stared. Not literally ‚Äî but in a way the brain couldn‚Äôt quite fight. One second it was a house. The next, a face. Then a sentence he couldn‚Äôt read.

‚ÄúWhat do they mean?‚Äù he whispered to himself.

But no one answered.

Trevor had stepped outside ‚Äúto take a call.‚Äù Lena had gone silent again.

And Dennis, hands trembling, sat alone, staring at lines that made no sense ‚Äî and yet felt true.

He turned the last drawing upside down.

It didn‚Äôt help.

The shapes looked back at him now.



Chapter 19: Ghost Town

October 26th ‚Äì 8:12 AM

Dennis walked into town again, hands in his coat pockets, shoulders tight with unease he couldn‚Äôt quite name. The kind of tightness that sits in your bones before your brain catches up. His mouth was dry, his breath shallow, and his tongue tasted like he‚Äôd been chewing aluminum foil.

Something was different.

Something was off.

The street looked the same, technically‚Äîsame clean sidewalks, same identical hedges trimmed at exactly the same height, same banners fluttering from antique lamp posts reading Fall into Grayer Ridge! But every face that passed him wore the exact same smile. Not similar.

Exact.

He passed the house with the ever-smiling couple‚Äîthe ones who‚Äôd moved in without boxes, without effort, without time. The woman was there again. Her hair unmoved by the wind. Her pie, still in hand, as if she‚Äôd been holding it since the first day.

He was going to keep walking, ignore her like he had so many times before.

But something drew his eyes down.
To the crust.

And there it was.

Burned into the center‚Äîdeep into the golden ridges of the pie, darker than the rest‚Äîthe symbol. A circle, with a line drawn through it.

He stopped walking.

Stared.

The woman tilted her head at him like a curious dog. Still smiling.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, dear?‚Äù she asked, voice too sweet, too sharp around the edges.

Dennis blinked.

The pie was normal again.

No symbol. No mark. Just a perfectly ordinary lattice crust, gleaming with sugar and egg wash.

His jaw tightened. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he muttered.

He kept walking.

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì 8:45 AM

The shop windows were as fake-looking as ever. The same cardigan in the window of the men‚Äôs shop. The same bicycle, still positioned just slightly crooked, in front of the hardware store. The same posters in the coffee shop window announcing an event that already passed two weeks ago.

Nothing in this town ever changed.

Except for the things that did‚Äîbut only when you weren‚Äôt looking.

He ducked into the bakery. The same bell rang. The same woman stood behind the counter. And on the display‚Äî

The same five muffins.

They hadn‚Äôt sold a single one since Monday. Dennis had counted.
He‚Äôd even tried buying one.
It tasted like nothing.

He looked closer.

There.
On the side of one muffin, half-obscured by its wax paper liner.

The symbol again.

Circle. Line.

He leaned in.

Blink.

Gone.

It was just a shadow now. A trick of the light.

‚ÄúCan I help you, Dennis?‚Äù the woman behind the counter asked. Her voice didn‚Äôt match her face. It was a shade too high, a fraction too slow. Like a bad overdub.

He turned without answering and walked out.

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì 10:03 AM

He passed the bookstore. The church. The library. Nothing changed. Everything changed.

He couldn‚Äôt tell anymore.

A child passed him on the sidewalk, smiling. Holding a red balloon. A drawing fluttered in their hand before slipping into the wind.

Dennis turned to follow it‚Äî

And stopped mid-step.

His hand was raised.

Waving.

Smiling.

Perfect posture. Warm, polite, disconnected smile. Just like them.

He‚Äôd been waving at no one.

He dropped his hand immediately, took a sharp breath, and looked around. No one seemed to notice. But the panic was already there, crawling up his throat.

Why did I do that?

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì 12:38 PM

Dennis found himself standing in front of the old woman‚Äôs house again. The one next to his. The one with the withered hydrangeas and the blinds that never opened.

He didn‚Äôt remember walking there.

Didn‚Äôt remember leaving Main Street.

The front door was slightly ajar.

He stepped closer. Knocked gently.

No answer.

He pushed the door open an inch further. The smell of dust and potpourri spilled out. The air was thick, unmoving.

He called out. ‚ÄúMrs. Edden?‚Äù

No answer.

There was no sound at all. Not even a ticking clock. No radio. No creaking. No life.

He stepped inside.

And then‚Äî

Snap.

Black.

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì Time Unknown

He woke up in his living room.

Again.

Lights off.

Curtains drawn.

His shoes were muddy.

He checked his phone.

No calls. No messages. No timestamps.

Only his calendar was open.
Tomorrow‚Äôs date was circled.
Under it, in an event he didn‚Äôt make, it read:

‚ÄúFINALIZE INTEGRATION.‚Äù

His mouth went dry.

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì 4:16 PM

Dennis stood in front of his hallway mirror, gripping the edge of the frame so tightly his knuckles went white.

He smiled again.

Perfectly.

Effortlessly.

He didn‚Äôt try to.
He just did it.

And then he saw it.

His reflection blinked‚Äîtwice.

Too fast.

And not in sync.

Dennis backed away slowly.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

But he couldn‚Äôt stop smiling.

‚∏ª

October 27th ‚Äì 5:03 PM

He stood outside Trevor‚Äôs house again.

It looked‚Ä¶ different. Not dramatically. Just slightly. The trim was darker. The windows had curtains. The lawn looked freshly cut, even though Dennis hadn‚Äôt seen anyone mowing it.

He knocked.

Trevor answered quickly, too quickly, like he‚Äôd been waiting.

‚ÄúDennis,‚Äù he said, smiling gently. ‚ÄúWas wondering when you‚Äôd come by.‚Äù

Dennis stepped inside. Everything smelled too clean. Like bleach and lemon. Sanitized reality.

‚ÄúHave you been seeing them?‚Äù Dennis asked.

Trevor raised a brow. ‚ÄúSeeing what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe symbols. The pie. The muffins. The reflection.‚Äù Dennis was breathing heavier now. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong. Something‚Äôs changing me. I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt even tell when I‚Äôm doing it anymore. The perfection. The smiling. The‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired, Dennis.‚Äù

Dennis stopped.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been looking for something that‚Äôs not meant to be found,‚Äù Trevor continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the problem. But you keep acting like there is one.‚Äù

Dennis‚Äôs heart thumped harder.

‚ÄúI am the problem now, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù he said, barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Trevor said softly. ‚ÄúYou just need to let go. Stop pulling at the thread. It‚Äôll all work out in due time. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù

Dennis sat down on the sofa.

The light dimmed slightly.

Outside, the sky was orange now. Not quite sunset. But not normal, either.

‚ÄúYou believe that?‚Äù he asked.

Trevor looked at him for a long time.

Then nodded.

‚ÄúYes. I do.‚Äù

Dennis wasn‚Äôt sure if that was Trevor talking anymore.

But he stayed seated.

And kept smiling.


CHAPTER 20
October 28th ‚Äì Late Afternoon into Evening

Dennis sat at the edge of his bed, elbows on knees, palms pressed hard into his eye sockets. For the past week, reality had thinned like cheap wallpaper‚Äîpeeling in places, showing seams where there should be none. Each time he closed his eyes, he felt less himself, more like a borrowed script filling in an empty role. His handwriting had changed. The same cup kept reappearing in the sink no matter how many times he cleaned it. And worse: sometimes, when he looked in the mirror, his own smile startled him.

He hadn‚Äôt smiled.

Not intentionally, anyway.

On the nightstand sat a stack of Lena‚Äôs drawings, curling at the edges like dried petals. He had organized them in every configuration he could think of‚Äîchronologically, by color palette, by subject, by emotional tone. None of it made sense. No matter how he aligned them, some part always changed‚Äîlines that hadn‚Äôt been there before, tiny symbols moving to a different corner.

There were the symbols again.

That looping spiral. The sharp, jagged grid. The circle inside a triangle inside a square. They repeated in her work, in odd scrawls on town signs, in cracks of sidewalk, in flour dust on bakery counters. At first he thought it was paranoia. But now, he wasn‚Äôt so sure. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt his brain that was breaking. Maybe something was pushing against it, squeezing.

Trying to fit him in.

‚∏ª

Dennis stood in the hallway outside Trevor‚Äôs home, fists clenched, the air strangely still.

The porch light flicked on before he could knock.

Trevor opened the door as if he had been expecting him. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

Dennis didn‚Äôt answer right away. His throat was dry. ‚ÄúI need to talk.‚Äù

Trevor nodded solemnly and stepped aside. Lena was upstairs, drawing quietly. The house had that too-perfect silence again‚Äîlike a staged photo, like time had been paused and painted around them.

They sat at the kitchen table. Trevor brewed coffee without asking. Dennis watched his movements‚Äîmechanical, precise. Too smooth.

Too perfect.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been distant,‚Äù Trevor said, sliding a mug toward him.

Dennis didn‚Äôt drink it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been putting things together,‚Äù he muttered.

Trevor leaned back, arms crossed loosely. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think the drawings are messages. Not just childish nightmares. I think they‚Äôre‚Äîreminders‚Äîthings she can‚Äôt say out loud. Maybe things she doesn‚Äôt even understand consciously.‚Äù

Trevor was quiet for a long beat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been spiraling, Dennis. You look like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI found the spiral symbol in the center of the town square. In the ironwork. It wasn‚Äôt there before.‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice trembled. ‚ÄúI know it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre seeing what you want to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw it in the woman‚Äôs pie crust,‚Äù Dennis snapped. ‚ÄúI saw it in the bakery‚Äôs flour. I saw it scratched into the back of my own doorframe. Are you telling me I imagined all of that?‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs jaw twitched. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôre trying to make sense of something that shouldn‚Äôt be made sense of.‚Äù

Dennis pushed the cup away. ‚ÄúWhy are you saying that?‚Äù

Trevor exhaled. ‚ÄúBecause I think you‚Äôre closer to the edge than you realize.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed, Trevor.‚Äù

A flicker of something‚Äîuncertainty? fear?‚Äîcrossed Trevor‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúSo have you.‚Äù

Dennis leaned forward, voice low. ‚ÄúI think the town is doing something to us. To me. I think I‚Äôm being rewritten‚Äîbit by bit. Blackouts. Perfect behavior. The smiling. God, the smiling. I can feel it. It‚Äôs not me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being erased and replaced.‚Äù

Silence.

Then Trevor said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier if you let go.‚Äù

Dennis stared. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre holding on to something that‚Äôs already gone, Dennis. You. You‚Äôre already‚Ä¶ slipping. The more you fight it, the worse it feels.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you talking like that?‚Äù

Trevor finally met his eyes, and for a moment, Dennis saw something in them‚Äîdeep weariness. Pity. Or maybe guilt. ‚ÄúBecause I went through it too.‚Äù

The words stopped time.

Dennis sat frozen, blood draining from his fingers.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI fought it. Years ago. Before I moved to Grayer Ridge. Before I was Trevor.‚Äù His voice was almost a whisper. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt win. I just forgot I was fighting.‚Äù

Dennis stood up so fast his chair toppled backward. ‚ÄúNo. No, that‚Äôs not real. That‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor remained seated, hands open. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I stayed close to you. I saw it happening again. I saw it in your eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew this was happening to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought maybe if someone could remember, maybe something could change. Maybe you‚Äôd find a way out that I couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Dennis backed toward the door, chest tight. ‚ÄúWhat even are you?‚Äù

Trevor blinked. And for the briefest moment, the smile faltered. The mask slipped.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anymore.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dennis ran. The streets blurred around him in clean, symmetrical lines. The town was too perfect. The houses didn‚Äôt have cracks. The lawns didn‚Äôt have weeds. The cars never rusted. The sky never changed.

He made it back to his home, panting, eyes wild.

He pulled out the drawings again. One by one. Searching. Connecting lines. Drawing over symbols. He created a map. Then he turned it upside down. Then sideways. It didn‚Äôt make sense. Why didn‚Äôt it make sense?!

He tried to remember the first time he saw the spiral. He couldn‚Äôt. Not exactly. He tried to remember what Lena‚Äôs voice sounded like. That, too, was slipping.

The drawings pulsed with conflicting meaning. A child‚Äôs house with too many windows. A stick figure with no face, then too many. A field that was also a maze. A dark smudge with the word ‚Äúremember‚Äù written over it again and again.

Then, finally, the last drawing Lena had given him.

He hadn‚Äôt looked at it yet.

Hands trembling, Dennis turned it over.

A perfect mirror image of his own house. But the windows weren‚Äôt drawn in. They were blacked out. The door was sealed shut. Above it, written in her scrawled childish hand:

YOU‚ÄôRE ALREADY INSIDE.

Dennis stared at it for a long time, unable to breathe.

The lights in the house didn‚Äôt flicker.

Nothing moved.

Nothing needed to.

Because the truth wasn‚Äôt outside.

It was him.

And the integration?

It was almost complete.

I forgot I'd asked him to call. 

I forgot he'd promised he would.

The harsh buzz of notifications dragged me from sleep like claws. My phone's screen blazed angry white in the dim morning light.

I jolted upright, cursing myself for sleeping through Ray's call, fingers fumbling for the device when my bedroom door burst open without a knock.

My mother stood frozen in the doorway in her white cotton nightgown, backlit by the hallway light. She never came into my room without knocking first, not since I turned fifteen and demanded privacy. She stared at me with wide, hollow eyes that looked like they'd seen something terrible. Her face had drained of all colour.

""What is it, Mom?"" The words came out sharper than intended. My phone was still buzzing on the nightstand.

She remained silent, just standing there like a statue. I could see her hands shaking at her sides.

""Mom, what is it?"" This time I was yelling, panic creeping into my voice because she never acted like this.

My mother finally stepped closer on unsteady legs, reaching out to cup my face like I might disappear if she wasn't careful enough.

""Oh, Evelyn, my darling...""

Is she crying? Those were definitely tears, real tears streaming down her cheeks. My mother never cried. Not when Grandpa died, not ever in front of me.

A terrible thought struck me. ""Where's Dad? Did something happen to him? Is he okay?""

""Mom, what is it?"" I started to spiral, that familiar panic clawing up my throat. ""Why are you crying? Where's Da-""

Dad appeared in the doorway then, and he looked terrible. Unlike Mom's nightgown, he was fumbling with the buttons of his work shirt. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his hair was sticking up like he had been running his hands through it. He looked like he'd aged ten years overnight.

""Dad?"" The word came out strangled.

""I'll take her, Mary,"" he said gently, resting a protective hand on my mother's shoulder. His voice sounded hoarse, like he'd been talking all night. ""You should rest.""

""Take me where? What the hell is going on?!"" I never swore in front of my parents, but nothing about this morning was normal.

Dad's shoulders sagged like someone had piled rocks on them. When he spoke, he looked at the floor instead of at me. 

""Sweetheart... Ray had an accident last night. He wanted to see you before we need to go to the hospital.""

""What?!"" The word exploded from me. My phone vibrated off the nightstand and clattered to the floor. ""What do you mean Ray had an accident? What kind of accident? Is he okay? Tell me he's okay!""

""Yes, yes, he is,"" my mother rushed to say, but her voice was shaking and she was still crying, which didn't make any sense if he was okay. Her hands moved frantically through my hair. ""He is, dear. He is.""

""Then why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why are you both acting like this? What aren't you telling me, Dad?""

Dad looked at Mom, and something passed between them one of those silent conversations parents have when they're trying to protect you from something.

Dad said finally. ""We'll explain everything in the car.""

But they didn't explain anything in the car.

The drive to the hospital passed in heavy silence. Dad's knuckles were white against the steering wheel, and he kept checking the rearview mirror like he was afraid of something following us. Neither of us spoke every time I opened my mouth to ask a question, the look on his face stopped me.

I burst through the hospital's automatic doors, my sneakers squeaking against the polished floor. The smell hit me immediately cleaning supplies and something medicinal that made my nose burn. It was too bright inside, all fluorescent lights and white walls that hurt to look at.

""Which room is Raymond Cooper in?"" I demanded of the first nurse I saw, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and tired lines around her mouth.

My father's footsteps echoed behind me, and I could hear him breathing hard like he'd been running.

The nurse's face shifted when she heard Ray's name. Her expression became careful, professional. ""Are you family?""

""I'm his girlfriend. This is my dad."" The word 'girlfriend' felt, too small for what Ray and I actually were to each other.

She pointed toward the ICU with a gentle gesture that made my stomach drop. ""Third floor. But honey, you should speak with his family first. They're waiting up there.""

No. No, no, no.

The ICU was for serious things. Ray had an accident, but he was okay. Mom said he was okay.

The elevator ride to the third floor felt like it took forever. Dad stood beside me, his jaw clenched tight. I could see the muscle jumping underneath his skin.

""Dad,"" I whispered as we reached the third floor. ""What kind of accident?""

He looked at me with eyes that seemed older than they had been yesterday. ""Car accident, sweetheart.""

The elevator doors opened with a soft ding that sounded too cheerful for where we were.

Ray's family clustered outside the ICU like they'd been there all night. His mother was sobbing into his father's chest, not quite crying, but the kind of raw, choking sounds that come from somewhere deep inside. Her whole body shook with each breath. His father held her tight, his face buried in her hair, and his shoulders were trembling too.
Ray's little brother, Jake, sat in a plastic chair that was too big for him, his hands on his lap, his face red and swollen, and he looked so much smaller than the last time I'd seen him.

This wasn't right. None of this was right.

Ray's grandmother sat next to Jake, her weathered hands folded in her lap. She was the strong one in their family, the one who made everyone laugh at dinner and told stories about the old country. But now she looked ancient, like she'd collapsed if the breeze was a bit too strong.

I was an overthinker. Always had been. Always seeing disasters where there weren't any, making up worst-case scenarios in my head.

This was just another one of my spirals. Had to be.

We approached the family like we were walking underwater, everything slow and distorted.

Ray's uncle Tom, whose eyes usually crinkled when he smiled, stepped forward. Those same eyes were now red and hollow, like he hadn't slept in days.

""Hey, Eve..."" His voice was rough, unused.

""Ray,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Where is he? Can I see him? Are his injuries bad? What happened exactly? When did it happen? Why is everyone so upset if he's okay?""

Tom looked away, toward my dad, and I saw his eyes fill with fresh tears.

""Eve..."" His voice broke on my name like it was too heavy to say.

""He's in there, right?"" I pointed toward the ICU doors. ""I can see him, right? Did he break his legs? His arms? Is he unconscious? When will he wake up? Did they say when he'll wake up?""

The questions kept pouring out because if I stopped talking, if I let there be silence, then someone might tell me something I didn't want to hear.

""Ray broke his ribs, didn't he? That's why Mrs. Cooper is crying? Because it hurts and she doesn't like seeing him in pain? 
That's it, right?""

""Evelyn..."" Tom's voice was barely a whisper.

He swallowed hard, and I could see his throat working like he was trying not to throw up.

""Ray... Ray didn't make it, honey.""

The words hung in the air like smoke. I could see them, almost, floating between us, but they didn't make sense. They were in English, but they might as well have been in a foreign language.

I laughed.

It was a sound I'd never heard from myself before sharp and hollow and completely wrong.

""Oh. Oh! I'm dreaming, right? This is just a really bad dream,"" I heard myself say as something hot started running down my face. ""These dreams have been getting so realistic lately... It's crazy how real they feel...""

I spun toward my father and grabbed his shirt sleeve, bunching the fabric in my fists.

""Dad, you can wake me up, right? I'm sleeping upstairs in my bed, can you come wake me up? Please, Dad. I don't like this dream anymore. Please wake me up.""

""Oh, my darling,"" he whispered, wrapping his arms around me tight enough that I couldn't move. His voice sounded broken too. ""I'm here. I'm right here with you.""

But nothing was right. Ray was supposed to call me last night. Ray was supposed to pick me up at four this evening. We were supposed to go get coffee, find a poetry book for Adam, and go to the birthday party. Ray was supposed to be here, teasing me about the dress I was going to wear today, stealing sips of my coffee and complaining about having to accompany me to the bookstore on a Saturday.

""What happened?"" I asked against Dad's shirt, my voice muffled and strange. ""How did it happen?""

Tom cleared his throat. ""He‚Ä¶left early morning, saying he had an errand to run. Around five-thirty in the morning. A drunk driver ran a red light and hit him at the intersection on Pine Street.""

Pine Street. We'd walked past that intersection a thousand times. There was a stop sign there that was always crooked, and a pothole that Ray always swerved around because he was paranoid about his car.

""Was he..."" I couldn't finish the question.

""He died an hour before we called for you"" Tom said quietly.

I cried until my throat was raw, until my eyes were swollen shut, until there was nothing left inside me but an empty ache where my heart used to be. Dad held me the whole time, and I could feel him crying too, his tears falling into my hair.

Ray said he'd never leave me. He promised he'd be here even when I got old and lost my teeth. 

My Ray. My sun. The person who made everything brighter just by existing.

Pola was eating alone.

She'd taken the day off work on account of the anticipated news from the doctor and the anxiety it caused. Sometime today, the doctor‚Äôd said. But there was nothing when she'd called this morning. We usually have biopsy results in the afternoon, the receptionist had told her. Call back then, OK? OK. In the meantime, she just wanted to take her mind off it. It's funny, isn't it? If she was sick, she was already sick, and if she was healthy, she was healthy, but either way she felt presently the same: just fine,‚Äù she told the waiter who was asking about the fried eggs she hadn't touched. ‚ÄúI like ‚Äòem just fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúSixth floor, like me. And the wife was past tense, long dead by then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he went in *to get the wife*.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's what I heard too.‚Äù

‚Äú*Dead*. What he went in to get was the wife's ring.‚Äù

Although Pola was not normally one to eavesdrop, today she'd allowed herself the pleasure. Eat eggs, listen in on strangers‚Äô conversation, then maybe get the laundry to the laundromat, take a walk, enjoy the air, buy a coat. And make the call. In the afternoon, make the call.

She gulped. The cheap metal fork shook in her hand. She put it down on the plate. *Clink.* 

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said to the workmen‚Äîwho looked immediately over, a few sizing her up‚Äîbecause why not, today of all days, do something so unlike her, even if did make her feel embarrassed: ‚Äúbut would it be terribly rude of me to ask what it is you're disagreeing about?‚Äù

One grabbed his hat and pulled it off his head. ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam. Wouldn't be rude at all. What we're discussing is an incident that happened years ago near where Pete, who would be that ugly dog over there‚Äî‚Äù He pointed at a smiling man with missing teeth and a leathery face, who bowed his head. ‚Äú‚Äîan incident involving a man who died. That much we agree about. We agree also that he lived somewhere on a floor that was higher than lower, that this building caught fire and burned, and that the man burned too.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy gosh. How awful,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúA man burned to death‚Ä¶‚Äù (And she imagined this afternoon's phone call: the doctor's words (‚ÄúI'm very sorry, but the results‚Ä¶‚Äù) coming out of the receiver and into her ear as flames, and when the call ended she would walk sick and softly to the mirror and see her own face melting‚Ä¶)

‚ÄúWell, ma‚Äôam, see, now that part's something we don't agree on. Some of us this think he burned, others that he burned *to death*.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell it better,‚Äù said another workman.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù said Pola.

He downed the rest of his coffee. ‚ÄúOK, there was this guy who lived in a lower east side apartment building. He had a little daughter, and she lived there too. Whether there was a wife is apparently up in the air, but ultimately it doesn't matter. Anyway, one day there was a fire. People start yelling. The guy looks into the hall and smells smoke, so he grabs his daughter's hand and they both go out into the hall. ‚ÄòWait here for daddy,‚Äô he tells her. ‚ÄòNo matter what, don't move.‚Äô The little girl nods, and the guy goes back into the apartment *for some reason we don't agree on.* Meanwhile, somebody else exits another apartment on the same floor, sees the little girl in the hall, and, thinking she's alone, picks her up and they go down the fire escape together. All the time the little girl is kicking and screaming, ‚ÄòDaddy, daddy,‚Äô but this other person figures she's just scared of the fire. The motivation is good. They get themselves to safety.

‚ÄúThen the guy comes back out of the apartment, into the hall. He doesn't see his daughter. He calls her name. Once, twice. There's more smoke now. The fire‚Äôs spreading. A few people go by in a panic, and he asks them if they've seen a little girl, but nobody has. So he stays in the hall, calling his daughter‚Äôs name, looking for her, but she's already safe outside. And the fire is getting worse, and when the firemen come they can't get it under control. Everybody else but the guy is out. They're all standing a safe distance away, watching the building go up in flames. And the guy, he refuses to leave, even as things start collapsing. Even as he has trouble breathing. Even as he starts to burn.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever did find a body, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù said the first workman.

‚ÄúWhich is why we disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm telling you, he just burned up, turned to ash. From dust to dust. That's all there is to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I'm telling you they would have found something. Bones, teeth. Teeth don't burn. They certainly would've found teeth.‚Äù

‚ÄúA tragedy, either way,‚Äù said Pola, finding herself strangely affected by the story, by the plight of the man and his young daughter, to the point she started to tear up, and to concentrate on hiding it. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the daughter?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you believe there was a wife‚Äîthe little girl‚Äôs mother‚Äîand believe she wasn't in the building, the girl ends up living with the mother, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you believe there was no mother: orphanage.‚Äù

Just then one of the workmen looked over at the clock on the wall and said, ‚ÄúI'll be damned if that half hour didn't go by like a quarter of one. Back to work, boys.‚Äù

They laid some money on the table.

They got up.

A few shook the last drops of coffee from their cups into their mouths. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, thank you for your company today. While brief, it was most welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù said Pola. ‚ÄúThank you for the story.‚Äù

With that, they left, arguing about whether the little girl‚Äôs name was Cindy or Joyce as they disappeared through the door, and the diner got a little quieter, and Pola was left alone, to worry again in silence.

She left her eggs in peace.

The laundromat wasn't far and the laundry wasn't much, but it felt heavy today, burdensome, and Pola was relieved when she finally got it through the laundromat doors. She set it down, smiled at the owner, who never smiled back but nevertheless gave the impression of dignified warmth, loaded a machine, paid and watched the wash cycle start. The machine hummed and creaked. The clothes went round and round and round. ‚ÄúI didn't say he only shows up at night,‚Äù an older woman was telling a younger woman a couple of washing machines away. ‚ÄúI said he's *more often seen at night*, on account of the aura he has.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, but I ain't never seen him, day or night,‚Äù said the younger woman. She was chewing bubble gum. She blew a bubble‚Äîit burst. ‚ÄúAnd I have a hard time believing in anything as silly as a candle-man.‚Äù

‚Äú*Burning* man,‚Äù the old woman corrected her. 

‚ÄúJeez, Louise. He could be the flashlight-monk for all I care. Why you take it so personal anyway, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's the trouble with your generation. You don't believe in anything, and you have no respect for the history of a place. You're rootless.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh, cause we ain't trees. We're people. And we do believe. I believe in laundry and getting my paycheque on time, and Friday nights and neon lights, and perfume, and handsome strangers and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw him once,‚Äù said Louise, curtly. ‚ÄúIt was about a decade ago now, down by the docks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just what was a nice old lady like you doing in a dirty place like that?‚Äù

Bubble‚Äîpop.

‚ÄúI wasn't quite so old then, and it's none of your business. The point is I was there and I saw him. It was after dark, and he was walking, if you can call it that, on the sidewalk.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust like that, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on, tell your fariy tale. What else am I going to listen to until my clothes is clean?‚Äù

Louise made a noise like an affronted buffalo, then continued: ‚ÄúWe were walking in opposite directions on the same side of the street. So he was coming towards me, and I was going towards him. There was hardly anyone else around. It must have been October because the leaves were starting to turn colours. Yellow, orange, red. And that's what he looked like from a distance, a dark figure with a halo of warm, fiery colours, all shifting and blending together. As he got closer, I heard a hiss and some crackles, like from a woodfire, and I smelled smoke. Not from like a cigarette either, but from a real blaze, with some bacon on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you scared?‚Äù asked the younger woman. ‚ÄúIn this scenario of yours, I mean. Don't think for a moment I believe you're saying the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, at first. Because I thought he was a wacko, one of those protesters who pour gasoline on themselves to change the world, but then I thought, He's not saying anything, and there's no one around, so what kind of protest could this be? Plus the way he was moving, it wasn't like someone struggling. He was calm, slow even. Like he was resigned to the state he was in. Like he'd been in it for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was all on fire but wasn't struggling or screaming or nothing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's right.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo suffering at all, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not externally. But internally‚Äîmy gosh, I've never seen another human being so brooding.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I bet it was all in the eyes. Am I right, Louise?‚Äù

Pola was transfixed: by the washing machine, its spinning and its droning, by the slight imperfections in its circular movements, the way it had to be bolted down to prevent it from inching away from its spot, like a dog waiting for a treat, edging closer and closer to its owner, and out the door, and down the street, into a late New Zork City morning. 

‚ÄúEyes? Why, dearie, no. The Burning Man has no eyes. Just black, empty sockets. His eyes long ago melted down to whatever eyeballs melt down to. They were simply these two holes on either side of his nostrils. Deep, cavernous openings in a face that looked like someone's half-finished face carved out of charcoal. His whole body was like that. No clothes, no skin, no bones even. Just burnt, ashy blackness surrounded by flames, which you could feel. As we passed each other, I could feel the heat he was giving off.‚Äù

‚ÄúLouise, that's creepy. Stop it!‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm simply telling you what I experienced. You don't believe me anyway.‚Äù

The younger woman's cycle finished. She began transferring her load from the washer to a dryer. ‚ÄúDid he‚Äîdid he *do* anything to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe nodded at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat all?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's all, dearie. He did open his mouth, and I think he tried to say something, but I didn't understand it. All I heard was the hiss of a furnace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren't you *scared?* I get scared sometimes. Like when I watch a horror movie. Gawd, I hate horror movies. They're so stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not when he was close. If anything, I felt pity for him. Can you imagine: burning and burning and burning, but never away, never ending‚Ä¶‚Äù

The younger woman spat her bubble gum into her hand, then tossed it from her hand into a trashcan, as if ridding herself of the chewed up gum would rid her of the mental image of the Burning Man. ‚ÄúI ain't never seen him, and I don't plan to. He's not real. Only you would see a thing like that, Louise. It's your old age. You're a nutty old woman.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlenty of New Zorkers have seen the Burning Man. I'm hardly the only one. Sightings go back half a century.‚Äù

The dryer began its thudding.

‚ÄúWell, I ain't never even heard of it l till now, so‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's because you're not from here. You're from the Prairies or some such place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm a *city* girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúDearie, if you keep resisting the tales of wherever you are, you'll be a *nowhere* girl. You don't want to be a nowhere girl, do you?‚Äù

The younger woman growled. She shoved a fresh piece of bubble gum into her lipsticked mouth, and asked, ‚ÄúWhat about you‚Äîever heard of this Burning Man?‚Äù

It took Pola a few moments to realize the question was meant for her. Both women were now staring in her direction. Indeed, it felt like the whole city was staring in her direction. ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù she said finally, just as her washing machine came to a stop, ‚ÄúI believe I have.‚Äù

Louise smiled. 

The younger woman made a bulldog face. ‚ÄúYou people are all crazy,‚Äù she muttered. 

‚ÄúI believe he had a daughter. Cindy, or Joyce,‚Äù said Pola.

‚ÄúAnd what was *she*, a firecracker?‚Äù said the younger woman, chewing her bubble gum furiously.

‚ÄúI believe, an orphan,‚Äù said Pola.

They conversed a while longer, then the younger woman's clothes finished drying and she left, and then Louise left too. Alone, Pola considered the time, which was coming up to noon, and whether she should go home and call the doctor or go pick out a coat. She looked through the laundromat windows outside, noted blue skies, then looked at the owner, who smiled, and then again, surprised, out the windows, through which she saw a saturation of greyness and the first sprinklings of snowfall. Coat it is, she thought, and after dropping her clean clothes just inside her front door, closed that door, locked it and stepped into winter.

Although it was only early afternoon, the clouds and falling snow obscured the sun, plunging the city into a premature night. The streetlights turned on. Cars rolled carefully along white streets.

Pola kept her hands in her pockets.

She felt cold on the outside but fever-warm inside.

When she reached the department store, it was nearly empty. Only a few customers lingered, no doubt delaying their exits into the unexpected blizzard. Clerks stood idle. Pola browsed women's coats when one of them said, ‚ÄúMiss, you must really want something.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù said Pola. 

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said the clerk, ‚ÄúI just mean you must really want that coat to have braved such weather to get it.‚Äù He was young; a teenager, thought Pola. ‚ÄúBut that *is* a good choice,‚Äù he said, and she found herself holding a long, green frock she didn't remember picking up. ‚ÄúIt really suits you, Miss.‚Äù

She tried it on and considered herself in a mirror. In a mirror, she saw reflected the clerk, and behind him the store, and behind that the accumulating snow, behind which there was nothing: nothing visible, at least. 

Pola blushed, paid for the frock coat, put it on and passed outside. 

She didn't want to go home yet. 

Traffic thinned.

A few happy, hatless children ran past her with coats unbuttoned, dragging behind them toboggans, laughing, laughing.

The encompassing whiteness disoriented her.

Sounds carried farther than sight, but even they were dulled, subsumed by the enclosed cityscape.

She could have been anywhere.

The snowflakes tasted of blood, the air smelled of fragility.

Walking, Pola felt as if she were crushing underfoot tiny palaces of ice, and it was against this tableaux of swirling breaking blankness that she beheld him. Distantly, at first: a pale ember in the unnatural dark. Then closer, as she neared.

She stopped, breathed in a sharpness of fear; and exhaled an anxiety of steam.

Continued.

He was like a small sun come down from the heavens, a walking torchhead, a blistering cat‚Äôs eye unblinking‚Äîits orb, fully aflame, bisected vertically by a pupil of char.

But there was no mistaking his humanity, past or present.

He was a man.

He was the Burning Man.

To Pola‚Äôs left was a bus stop, devoid of standers-by. To her right was nothing at all. Behind her, in the direction the children had run, was the from-where-she‚Äôd-come which passes always and irrevocably into memory, and ahead: ahead was he.

Then a bus came.

A woman, in her fifties or sixties, got off. She was wearing a worn fur coat, boots. On her right hand she had a gold ring. She held a black purse.

The bus disappeared into snow like static.

The woman crossed the street, but as she did a figure appeared.

A male figure.

‚ÄúHey, bitch!‚Äù the figure said to the woman in the worn fur coat. ‚ÄúWhatcha got in that purse. Lemme take a look! Ya got any money in there? Ya do, dontcha! What else ya got, huh? What else ya got *between yer fucking legs, bitch?*‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Pola yelled‚Äî*in silence.*

The male figure moved towards the woman, stalking her. The woman walked faster, but the figure faster-yet. ‚ÄúHere, pussy pussy pussy‚Ä¶‚Äù

To Pola, they were silhouettes, lighted from the side by the aura of the Burning Man.

‚ÄúHere, take it,‚Äù the woman said, handing over her purse.

The figure tore through it, tossing its contents aside on the fresh snow. Pocketing wads of cash. Pocketing whatever else felt of value.

‚ÄúGimme the ring you got,‚Äù the figure barked.

The woman hesitated.

The figure pulled out a knife. ‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll cut it off you, bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it or I‚Äôll fuck you with this knife. Swear to our dear absent God‚Äîya fucking hear me?‚Äù

It was then Pola noticed that the Burning Man had moved. His light was no longer coming from the side of the scene unfolding before her but from the back. He was behind the figure, who raised the hand holding the knife and was about to stab downwards when the Burning Man‚Äôs black, fiery fingers touched him on the shoulder, and the male figure screamed, dropping the knife, turning and coming face-to-face with the Burning Man‚Äôs burning face, with its empty eyes and open, hissing mouth.

The woman had fallen backwards onto the snow.

The woman looked at the Burning Man and the Burning Man looked at her, and in a moment of utter recognition, the Burning Man‚Äôs grip eased from the figure‚Äôs shoulder. The figure, leaving the dropped knife, and bleeding from where the Burning Man had briefly held him, fled.

The woman got up‚Äî

The Burning Man stood before her.

‚Äîand began to cry.

Around them the snow had melted, revealing wet asphalt underneath.

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù she whispered.

When her tears hit the exposed asphalt, they turned to steam which rose up like gossamer strands before dissipating into the clouds.

The Burning Man began to emit puffs of smoke. His light‚Äîhis *burning*‚Äîfaltered, and the heat surrounding him weakened. Soon, flakes of snow, which had heretofore evaporated well before reaching him, started to touch his cheeks, his coal body. And starting from the top of his head, he ashed and fell away, crumbling into a pile of black dust at the woman‚Äôs boots, which soon the snowfall buried.

And a great gust of wind scattered it all.

After a time, the blizzard diminished. Pola approached the woman, who was still sobbing, and helped pick up the contents of her handbag lying on the snow. One of them was a driver‚Äôs license, on which Pola caught the woman‚Äôs first name: Joyce.

Pola walked into her apartment, took off her shoes and placed them on a tray to collect the remnants of packed snow between their treads.

She pushed open the living room curtains.

The city was wet, but the sky was blue and bright and filled the room, and there was hardly any trace left of the snowstorm.

She sat by the phone.

She picked up the handset and with her other hand dialed the number for the doctor.

She waited.

‚ÄúHello. My name is‚Äî,‚Äù she said quietly.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I understand. Tuesday at eleven o‚Äôclock will be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said, and put the handset back on the telephone switch hook. She remained seated. The snow in the shoe tray melted. The clock ticked. The city filled up with its usual bustle of cars and people. She didn‚Äôt feel any different than when she‚Äôd woken up, or gone to sleep, or worked last week, or shopped two weeks ago, or taken the ferry, or gone ice skating, or‚Äîexcept none of that was true, not quite; for she had gained something today. Something, ironically, *vital.* On the day she learned that within a year she would most probably be dead, Pola had acquired something transcendentally human.

September 13th ‚Äì 8:03 AM
Dennis woke in a park he didn‚Äôt remember walking to.

Shoes soaked. Dew on his sleeves. Birds in the trees chirped like nothing was wrong.

He was sitting on a bench beside a newspaper dated yesterday. A thermos was beside him‚Äîhalf empty. His fingerprints were on it.

He didn‚Äôt own a thermos.

The smell of coffee still clung to his breath. It tasted sweet, like how he used to take it years ago‚Äîbefore he stopped drinking it altogether.

His phone said he‚Äôd called someone at 6:22 AM.
Trevor (Unknown Number)

Dennis stared at the screen. He didn‚Äôt remember having a signal here. The number was gone now. Just blanked out. No log of the call. Just a missing gap in his call history, like a skipped heartbeat.

When he stood, his knees buckled slightly, like he‚Äôd been sitting there a long time. But it didn‚Äôt feel like long. His legs were cold. His hands, trembling.

There was something scribbled on the inside of his wrist:

‚ÄúReturn before reset.‚Äù

In his own handwriting.

But he hadn‚Äôt written it.

‚∏ª

September 13th ‚Äì 11:41 AM

He wandered the neighborhood for hours.

Every house had something just slightly off.

The Bouchards‚Äô house had never had a second-floor balcony, but now it did‚Äîsmall, jutting out awkwardly over their garage. It looked fake. Too shallow. Too clean. Like it had been added for visual consistency.

A dog barked behind a hedge. But when Dennis looked, there was no dog.

Only an empty leash, looped around the post.

Still swinging.

The new neighbors waved from their plastic garden again. Same pie. Same clothes. Same unblinking smiles. A film of dust now coated their porch swing, like no one had used it in weeks.

He knocked on a few doors. Asked about Trevor. About the people who used to live here. About the mailbox that appeared in front of his own house overnight.

Everyone gave answers.

All of them different.

All of them wrong.

‚∏ª

September 14th ‚Äì 3:57 AM

He woke in his car.

Parked outside the old community library, half an hour out of town. Key still in the ignition. Tank half full.

The passenger seat held a stack of papers, all torn from different books. All handwritten notes. None in his handwriting.

Most of them were phrases:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúReplicated roles must remain unaware.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stabilizing, but inconsistently.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTrevor reset: failed attempt. Host still bonded.‚Äù

And one circled repeatedly:

‚ÄúConscious bleed = high risk of collapse.‚Äù

Dennis stared until his vision blurred.

The paper on top bore a familiar symbol:
A circle. A line through it.

He started the engine.

Drove home without thinking.

He didn‚Äôt remember the trip.

‚∏ª

September 14th ‚Äì 8:16 PM

Dennis tried to stay awake.

He set alarms. Drank cold water. Paced. Watched the news with the volume on high.

It didn‚Äôt help.

He blinked‚Äî

And the room was different.

Furniture moved. TV off. Alarm clock unplugged.

He checked the time on his phone. Two hours had passed. And in the middle of his living room floor, a small red cube sat perfectly centered.

It wasn‚Äôt his.

When he picked it up, it was heavy. Metallic. Smooth like surgical steel.

No seams. No buttons.

But when he turned it in his hand, it made a soft click, and a message flashed across the black mirror of his turned-off television:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

‚∏ª

September 15th ‚Äì 12:22 PM

Dennis stopped trusting reflections.

The mirror in his bathroom didn‚Äôt show the same expressions he felt. His face looked too calm. Like it didn‚Äôt know what he was thinking.

He caught himself watching himself too long.

And sometimes, the reflection was looking back‚Ä¶ before he turned.

He covered the mirrors with towels.

But at night, they were uncovered again.

‚∏ª

September 15th ‚Äì 9:40 PM

Dennis walked to Trevor‚Äôs house again, though he didn‚Äôt remember deciding to.

The forest was colder tonight. Soundless. The path seemed longer.

Trevor‚Äôs house was exactly the same.

And yet, it wasn‚Äôt.

The chimney was gone. Again. The trim was white now. The stone darker. The doorknob colder.

Dennis knocked.

No answer.

He stepped inside anyway.

No family portraits. Just those neutral stranger-faces again, dozens of them. A photo sat slightly tilted on a shelf‚Äîit was him, Dennis, sitting on Trevor‚Äôs couch. Laughing. Holding a mug.

He didn‚Äôt remember it.

But he was wearing the exact shirt he had on now.

Down the hall, the door to the child‚Äôs room was cracked.

He heard a voice inside.

Small. Familiar.

Lena.

Singing.

He crept closer, heart pounding, knees weak.

But when he pushed the door open‚Äî

Nothing.

Just the book again, sitting neatly on the bed.

Now open to the last page.

This time, no name.

Only a phrase written at the bottom in tight, perfect print:

‚ÄúYour compliance has been noted.‚Äù


Chapter 12: A Quiet Return

September 16th ‚Äì 4:18 AM
Dennis opened his eyes.

He was lying in bed. On top of the covers. Fully clothed. The window was open, letting in a cold breeze that felt like it didn‚Äôt belong in late summer.

His heart thudded with a deep, anxious pulse.

He sat up slowly, scanning the room. Everything looked exactly as he remembered‚Ä¶ but something about the silence felt placed. Not natural. As if someone had arranged it.

He looked down at his arm.

The words were gone.

Nothing written on his wrist.

No cube. No book. No whispers. No trace of the last twelve hours.

He stood and stepped out into the hallway. His body ached with the weight of unearned exhaustion‚Äîlike he‚Äôd lived a full day somewhere else.

He didn‚Äôt remember falling asleep.

He remembered the book.
The phrase.
‚ÄúYour compliance has been noted.‚Äù

And then‚Äî

Nothing.

‚∏ª

September 16th ‚Äì 7:12 AM

The morning was too bright. The sky painted in clean, artificial blues. No clouds. No birds.

Dennis stood barefoot in his front yard, arms crossed, staring down the street.

Trevor‚Äôs house‚Äîthe one he used to live in‚Äîwas back.

Perfectly normal. White picket fence, red door, rose bushes pruned just the same. The wind chimes hanging on the porch were back too, swaying gently without a sound.

And the house in the woods?

Gone.

No stone. No chimney. No path.

Dennis walked two blocks toward the woods, just to check.

There was no break in the trees now. No clearing. No trail. Just an unbroken wall of pines and thorns, thick and impenetrable like it had always been that way.

But it hadn‚Äôt.

He knew it hadn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

September 16th ‚Äì 8:03 AM

Trevor was outside, watering the roses.

Dennis approached slowly.

His voice came out hoarse, hesitant. ‚ÄúTrevor?‚Äù

Trevor turned, smiled casually like nothing had ever been wrong. He looked exactly the same‚Äîslightly wrinkled button-up, jeans a little too clean, faint smell of wood and mint.

‚ÄúMorning, Dennis. You‚Äôre up early.‚Äù

Dennis stared. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ back.‚Äù

Trevor blinked. Tilted his head. ‚ÄúBack from where?‚Äù

Dennis took a step closer. ‚ÄúYou moved. I saw you. You and Lena. You were living in the woods. There was a house. You‚Äîyou said something about it being safer‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor laughed lightly, brushing dirt off his hands. ‚ÄúHouse in the woods? That doesn‚Äôt sound like us.‚Äù

Dennis‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúTrevor, I went inside it. Multiple times. I found‚Äîpictures. Letters. Your daughter‚Äôs drawings. A book that said‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor raised a hand gently, almost condescendingly. ‚ÄúI think you might‚Äôve had a bad dream, Dennis.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúI have things. Memories. I saw the furniture. The portraits. You were gone. Everyone said you didn‚Äôt exist anymore!‚Äù

Trevor looked at him with a polite, puzzled expression‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lived here this whole time, Dennis. Maybe you‚Äôve been working too hard.‚Äù

Dennis stared at him, suddenly aware of the absurd quiet around them. No cars. No breeze. Not even a single insect. Just the soft hiss of water from Trevor‚Äôs hose, arcing over dirt that didn‚Äôt seem to absorb it.

‚ÄúYou said‚Äî‚Äù Dennis‚Äôs voice dropped, almost to a whisper, ‚ÄúYou said she was drawing things she couldn‚Äôt explain. Do you remember that? Lena‚Äôs pictures. They kept changing.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs smile stayed fixed. His eyes sharpened slightly, but only for a moment.

Then he said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a child, Dennis. You shouldn‚Äôt worry so much about what children draw.‚Äù

‚∏ª

September 16th ‚Äì 9:10 AM

Dennis walked home, throat dry, mind spinning.

The entire neighborhood looked‚Ä¶ cleaner. Too clean. Every lawn trimmed with precision. Every flower in perfect bloom. Cars parked exactly even. Windows polished.

When he reached his own porch, something caught his eye.

A small package sat at the door.

Plain brown box.

No return address.

He picked it up. Light. Taped shut.

Inside:
A single object wrapped in white cloth.

He unfolded it carefully.

A black and white photograph.

Himself.
Sitting in Trevor‚Äôs old kitchen. Holding Lena‚Äôs drawing. Smiling.

In the photo, Trevor sat beside him, staring directly into the camera.

But Lena wasn‚Äôt in the picture.

Instead, the chair where she should‚Äôve been?

Empty.

Only a small drawing tacked to the wall behind it‚Äî

A crude sketch of a man with no face.
Standing in a forest.
Pointing at a house that wasn‚Äôt there anymore.



Chapter 13: Every Road Leads Home

September 18th ‚Äì 9:44 AM

Dennis sat at the kitchen table, staring at Lena‚Äôs drawing for the third hour straight.

He hadn‚Äôt even noticed the paper in his hand that morning. It was just‚Ä¶ there. Folded on the counter beside his keys, like it had been left for him ‚Äî or by him. He couldn‚Äôt remember.

It was drawn in soft pencil: a house ‚Äî not his, not Trevor‚Äôs. A house with no doors. The windows were smeared black, as if they‚Äôd been erased. Surrounding it, stick-figures with oversized heads stood in a circle, their necks bending at impossible angles. Their eyes were all wrong ‚Äî wide, with too many lashes, and hollow in the middle. No pupils. Just rings.

But it was the sky that disturbed him most.

Drawn in jagged, frantic strokes, the sky above the house was filled with eyes. Hundreds. All staring down, some crying, some bleeding.

One corner of the paper had been torn off. Like someone had tried to remove something.

Dennis turned it over.

In the bottom corner, scribbled in faint graphite:
‚ÄúShe said we can‚Äôt leave until we forget.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt know who she was.

And he didn‚Äôt want to ask.

‚∏ª

September 18th ‚Äì 2:21 PM

Dennis stood across from Trevor on the lawn.

The original house. The old white colonial that had sat empty for weeks was now exactly as it had been. Porch swing, chipped paint, potted fern ‚Äî even the mailbox with the little iron bird. Trevor was crouched down, helping Lena plant yellow marigolds like nothing had changed.

Dennis approached slowly, unsure whether to speak or run.

‚ÄúHey, stranger,‚Äù Trevor said without looking up. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to see you out today. You look like hell.‚Äù

Dennis didn‚Äôt respond at first. He stepped forward, blinking. The marigolds were already blooming. They‚Äôd been planted minutes ago.

‚ÄúTrevor‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice cracked. ‚ÄúThe other house. The one in the woods‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor looked up, brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat house?‚Äù

Dennis tried to stay calm. ‚ÄúYou know what I‚Äôm talking about. The white stone one. I came there. You were there. Your daughter was there.‚Äù

Trevor tilted his head, smiling slightly. ‚ÄúDennis, we‚Äôve lived here since the start. You feeling alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou showed me a room,‚Äù Dennis continued, breath quickening. ‚ÄúWith portraits. There was a book. The hallway kept changing. Your house moved. You‚Äî‚Äù He stopped.

Trevor stood.

He stepped forward gently, voice soft. ‚ÄúHave you been sleeping?‚Äù

Lena stood in the doorway behind him, watching. Her face was calm, polite ‚Äî like a student waiting to be called on.

‚ÄúYou invited me there,‚Äù Dennis muttered. ‚ÄúYou said they were watching me.‚Äù

Trevor chuckled, warm and empty. ‚ÄúYou need a break, man. Stress does weird things to memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no. Don‚Äôt do that. Don‚Äôt gaslight me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you are.‚Äù Dennis stepped closer. ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd explain. That day in the woods‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been in the woods since last winter,‚Äù Trevor said, arms crossed. ‚ÄúHunting season ended. You know that.‚Äù

Dennis opened his mouth.

But the words were gone.

Like they‚Äôd never been there at all.

‚∏ª

September 20th ‚Äì 8:08 AM

Dennis packed a small bag. He wrote a note for himself: ‚ÄúGoing to visit Mom. Do not turn around.‚Äù
He slipped it into his wallet.

The drive out of Grayer Ridge was slow, too quiet. As he passed the edge of town, the buildings thinned, and the roads narrowed. Trees blurred past his window like wet paint on glass. He kept his hands at ten and two. Eyes forward. Radio off.

But then‚Äî

A blink.

And suddenly he was pulling into his own driveway.

The engine ticking softly.

Bag still in the back seat.

He looked at the clock.

8:12 AM.

Four minutes had passed.

The road out of town was twenty-five miles long.

‚∏ª

September 21st ‚Äì 6:33 PM

He tried again.

This time on foot. He walked fast, cutting through backyards, avoiding main roads. He made it past the gas station, past the welcome sign, even onto the stretch of highway with no shoulder.

He kept walking.

Eventually the sky turned pink. Then orange. Then‚Äî

Dark.

He opened his eyes in the bathtub.

Water cold.

Clothes dry.

Shivering.

The lights in the bathroom flickered once, then held steady.

A note was taped to the mirror.

His own handwriting.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. You came back on your own.‚Äù

He ripped it down, stared at it.

It wasn‚Äôt the handwriting that disturbed him ‚Äî it was the tone.
It didn‚Äôt sound like him. It sounded like someone impersonating him. Someone who knew how he wrote, but not why.

‚∏ª

September 23rd ‚Äì 10:01 PM

Trevor stopped by that night.

Dennis didn‚Äôt remember inviting him. But there he was, on the porch, holding a beer, wearing that same unbothered grin.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been around lately,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúLena misses you.‚Äù

Dennis nodded slowly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ sorting some things out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm being monitored.‚Äù

Trevor took a sip. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we all?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean‚Äî‚Äù Dennis hesitated. ‚ÄúEvery time I try to leave town, I wake up here. Back in this house. I don‚Äôt even remember turning around. It‚Äôs like‚Äîlike someone‚Äôs editing my life. Trimming it.‚Äù

Trevor smiled faintly.

‚ÄúDo you ever feel like your choices aren‚Äôt your own?‚Äù

Trevor set the beer down. ‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù He looked Dennis in the eye. ‚ÄúI try not to think about things like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it doesn‚Äôt matter. Whether it‚Äôs you making the decisions or someone else‚Äîeither way, you‚Äôre still here. You still end up where you‚Äôre supposed to be.‚Äù

Dennis looked at him hard. ‚ÄúDid you write the note on my mirror?‚Äù

Trevor blinked. Once. Slowly. ‚ÄúWhat note?‚Äù

Dennis stepped back.

‚ÄúI should go,‚Äù Trevor said suddenly. ‚ÄúBig day tomorrow. Come by sometime. We‚Äôll grill.‚Äù

And then he was gone, walking into the night with no flashlight, no sound of steps, just absence.

‚∏ª

September 24th ‚Äì 3:00 AM

Dennis tore apart the hallway closet looking for his old journals.

They were gone.

He opened a drawer to find a pair of shoes he didn‚Äôt remember buying. A sweater he would never wear. In the kitchen, a loaf of bread was open‚Äîbut he didn‚Äôt eat bread. Hadn‚Äôt for years.

Inside the fridge: a container labeled ‚ÄúTuesday.‚Äù

But it was Wednesday.

He opened it.

Empty.

Except for a folded slip of paper.

One sentence:

‚ÄúStop trying to leave. You‚Äôll ruin it.‚Äù



Chapter 14: Integration
September 24th ‚Äì 6:41 AM

Dennis stood in the bathroom mirror, toothbrush in hand, foam clinging to his bottom lip.

He smiled.

Perfectly.

Too perfectly.

The smile had happened before the thought. Before the muscle told itself to move. His hand raised, too‚Äîa little wave to no one. Then the smile dropped. His brow furrowed.

He didn‚Äôt remember deciding to do it.

‚∏ª

7:58 AM

Lena‚Äôs latest drawing sat on the kitchen table.

Dennis had been flipping through her old sketches again‚Äîhe kept them in a worn folder now, half out of guilt, half out of obsession. They had started simple: houses, animals, lopsided stick people.

But now the lines were cleaner. More symmetrical. Symbols repeated, always hidden in the corners: concentric circles, a shape like an inverted triangle nested inside a square. One page had what looked like a layout of Grayer Ridge‚Äîbut the streets twisted wrong. They overlapped like layers that weren‚Äôt supposed to exist at the same time.

And in the center: a house.

Not his house.

Trevor‚Äôs.

Except‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

‚∏ª

9:12 AM

Dennis caught himself saying good morning to Marcy.

Her name had left his mouth before he even looked up.

She was smiling on her porch in her robe and slippers, just like every morning.

‚ÄúWonderful day, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she called.

Dennis paused. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he replied, then immediately regretted it.

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúI heard you got new neighbors.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Dennis said again. His voice sounded strange in his ears. Like someone else was practicing being him.

‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs new, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù Marcy added.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

He looked toward the Perry house‚Äînow with perfectly trimmed hedges, new shutters, the same damn pie in the same woman‚Äôs hands. Still uneaten.

The couple waved at him in perfect sync.

He looked back at Marcy.

She wasn‚Äôt there.

The porch was empty.

He hadn‚Äôt heard her go inside.

‚∏ª

12:43 PM

Dennis found another note.

It was folded neatly into his wallet, tucked behind a grocery store receipt. Same handwriting as the others.

It read:
‚ÄúStop pretending. We see you.‚Äù

His hands started shaking.

He hadn‚Äôt written that.

Had he?

He grabbed a pen from the counter and scribbled on the back of a takeout menu. Same pen. Same flow. Different feel.

Something was off.

He tossed the note in the trash.

When he walked by again ten minutes later, it was gone.

‚∏ª

2:27 PM

Trevor was mowing his lawn.

The exact same push mower. The exact same gray T-shirt. Lena sat on the steps, sketchbook open, humming quietly.

Dennis crossed the street, slow. Unsure.

Trevor looked up and waved. ‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like hell.‚Äù

Dennis stood there. ‚ÄúYou were gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt here. Your house was in the woods. And then you weren‚Äôt. And now you‚Äôre back. Why?‚Äù

Trevor blinked at him. The mower idled behind him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always lived here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dennis said. ‚ÄúNo, you haven‚Äôt. You‚Ä¶ you invited me to that place. With the stone porch and the white frame, near the creek. You‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDennis,‚Äù Trevor said gently, ‚Äúyou feeling okay? Maybe get some rest.‚Äù

Lena looked up from her drawing.

Dennis caught a glimpse of it.

It was his house.

But the windows were different. There were eyes in them.

Not people.

Eyes.

Watching.

‚∏ª

5:05 PM

Dennis sat in his living room, lights off.

He could hear something scratching again. But not in the walls this time‚Äîin the ceiling.

He didn‚Äôt move.

His reflection in the blank TV screen looked calmer than he felt. Too calm. Mouth neutral. Hands still.

When he blinked, the reflection didn‚Äôt.

Then it did.

Twice.

Faster than his own.

He stood suddenly.

His hand knocked over a coaster.

Same symbol: a circle, line through it.

He picked it up and threw it across the room.

It landed face-up.

‚∏ª

9:33 PM

He tried writing down everything‚Äîeverything he remembered about Trevor, about Lena, about the new couple, the pie, the symbols, the strange ‚Äúcoincidences.‚Äù

But the words on the page didn‚Äôt make sense when he re-read them.

Whole phrases vanished when he looked away and looked back.

One sentence repeated, though.

He hadn‚Äôt written it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing so well.‚Äù

‚∏ª

September 25th ‚Äì 3:12 AM

Dennis woke up on the sidewalk in front of the town hall.

Shoes on the wrong feet.

A perfect smile frozen on his face.

He wiped it off with the back of his sleeve, trembling.

Something rustled behind him.

A paper, pinned to the bulletin board. He didn‚Äôt remember it being there.

It read:

‚ÄúOrientation begins soon.‚Äù

He turned.

The town was still.

No cars. No crickets. No lights.

He looked down at his hands again.

Perfectly clean. Fingernails trimmed.

But he didn‚Äôt remember doing that.


Chapter 15: The Shape That Doesn‚Äôt Fit

September 23rd ‚Äì 6:41 AM

Dennis caught himself staring into the mirror.

Mouth curled into a tight, flawless smile. Eyes wide. Chin tilted upward slightly, like he was posing for a photo.

He blinked and it broke.

His shoulders relaxed. His face fell back into place.

He didn‚Äôt remember why he was standing in front of the mirror to begin with. The sink was dry. No toothbrush. No towel. Just him. His reflection. And that perfect grin that hadn‚Äôt felt like his.

He touched the glass.

It felt cool, solid.

But something behind his eyes didn‚Äôt match.

‚∏ª

September 24th ‚Äì 3:03 PM

He kept seeing the symbol.

Not just in the drawings or the mirror, but everywhere. Etched lightly into the corner of receipts. Carved into the base of a streetlamp. Once, even scratched into the condensation on his bathroom mirror.

A circle. With a single line cut through the center‚Äîdiagonal, imperfect.

It wasn‚Äôt just a symbol anymore. It felt personal. Like it was following him. Like it was a question someone kept asking that he didn‚Äôt know how to answer.

He started keeping a notebook. Drawing it. Repeating it. Hoping it might unlock something. But the more he stared at the sketches, the more the shape seemed to move, subtly, in his peripheral vision. Like the angles changed depending on how much he believed in it.

Trevor noticed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been out of it lately,‚Äù he said, leaning on Dennis‚Äôs kitchen counter that evening. ‚ÄúAre you sleeping?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think?‚Äù

Dennis hesitated. ‚ÄúSometimes I wake up in the living room. Sometimes in the hallway. Once‚Ä¶ once in the neighbor‚Äôs yard. I don‚Äôt remember walking there.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs face twitched. A flicker of discomfort. But it smoothed itself quickly, too quickly.

‚ÄúStress does strange things,‚Äù Trevor said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been through a lot. New place. New people. Maybe you‚Äôre not adapting as well as we thought.‚Äù

Dennis latched onto the word.

‚ÄúWe?‚Äù

Trevor didn‚Äôt answer at first.

Then he laughed softly and shook his head. ‚ÄúSorry. Just a figure of speech.‚Äù

‚∏ª

September 25th ‚Äì 1:29 PM

Lena handed Dennis another drawing.

No words. Just silently slipped it into his hand while he sat on the porch steps.

Trevor was inside, talking to someone on the phone in low tones.

The drawing looked like a map.

But not of any place Dennis recognized.

There were roads‚Äîyes‚Äîbut they bent at impossible angles, looping in on themselves. Symbols lined the paths‚Äîcircles, spirals, the same diagonal-cut shape, and one that looked like an eye half-closed.

At the center of the map: a house.

His house.

He stared at it until the page blurred. The longer he looked, the less the drawing made sense. Roads disappeared. Reappeared. The house rotated slowly on the page without moving.

‚ÄúWhat is this, Lena?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúI drew it yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just remember it.‚Äù

Dennis looked up at her.

Her expression was blank, not afraid‚Äîjust resigned, like she was used to not understanding the things that came out of her own hands.

She walked away without another word.

‚∏ª

September 26th ‚Äì 9:08 PM

Dennis woke up again in the kitchen, the front door open.

His feet were muddy. The floor was wet.

A trail led from the door to the couch.

He didn‚Äôt remember walking anywhere.

He shut the door. Cleaned his feet. But the mud didn‚Äôt smell like dirt. It smelled like copper and pine.

He found a folded note on the counter.

You‚Äôre almost there.

It was in his handwriting.

He didn‚Äôt remember writing it.

He flipped it over. Nothing on the back. But the paper felt warm, like it had just been held. Someone had pressed it tight. The corners were softened.

He kept all the notes in a drawer now. Twenty-two of them.

Most were brief.

Don‚Äôt tell Trevor yet.

You‚Äôre not finished.

He knows what you forgot.

Remember the smell of bleach.

He hadn‚Äôt written any of them. And yet‚Ä¶ they were all written by him.

‚∏ª

September 27th ‚Äì 10:14 AM

Trevor found Dennis sitting on the floor of the garage, staring at the pattern of oil on concrete.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt called,‚Äù Trevor said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs mine anymore,‚Äù Dennis replied.

Trevor crouched next to him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the first person this has happened to,‚Äù he said.

Dennis looked up sharply. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

But Trevor only sighed. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre trying too hard. You‚Äôre forcing something open that‚Äôs supposed to stay closed until it‚Äôs time. You have to let it happen naturally.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

Trevor shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúJust breathe. Try to‚Ä¶ stop digging.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I have to,‚Äù Dennis whispered.

Trevor didn‚Äôt argue. He just stood, dusted off his pants, and walked back toward the house.

‚∏ª

September 28th ‚Äì 11:03 PM

Dennis sat on his bed, the map-drawing from Lena laid out in front of him.

He‚Äôd redrawn it five times.

Each version came out different. The roads curved wider or narrower. The lines darkened or softened. The house at the center changed shape.

It was like trying to copy a dream from memory.

He stared at one particular road that twisted back onto itself and ended in a circle with a slash.

That symbol again.

He traced it with his finger.

He whispered aloud: ‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù

He blinked.

And he was standing in the middle of his street.

Shoes unlaced. Shirt inside-out.

A full minute passed before he could breathe again.

He didn‚Äôt remember getting up.

Didn‚Äôt remember leaving the house.

Didn‚Äôt remember deciding to speak.

‚∏ª

He‚Äôs forgetting his choices now.

Forgetting the line between observation and participation.

Trevor says to trust him‚Äîbut he‚Äôs started using words Dennis doesn‚Äôt understand.

Integration.

Adaptation.

Synchronization.

Dennis wants to believe in something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîbut the world is bending sideways, and even his own reflection is starting to look like a man he wouldn‚Äôt trust.

There‚Äôs another drawing folded in his mailbox now.

This time, it‚Äôs not from Lena.

The symbol is drawn in thick black ink.

Underneath it, a single phrase:

‚ÄúThis is who you are now.‚Äù",1,1754658886.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

I forgot I'd asked him to call. 

I forgot he'd promised he would.

The harsh buzz of notifications dragged me from sleep like claws. My phone's screen blazed angry white in the dim morning light.

I jolted upright, cursing myself for sleeping through Ray's call, fingers fumbling for the device when my bedroom door burst open without a knock.

My mother stood frozen in the doorway in her white cotton nightgown, backlit by the hallway light. She never came into my room without knocking first, not since I turned fifteen and demanded privacy. She stared at me with wide, hollow eyes that looked like they'd seen something terrible. Her face had drained of all colour.

""What is it, Mom?"" The words came out sharper than intended. My phone was still buzzing on the nightstand.

She remained silent, just standing there like a statue. I could see her hands shaking at her sides.

""Mom, what is it?"" This time I was yelling, panic creeping into my voice because she never acted like this.

My mother finally stepped closer on unsteady legs, reaching out to cup my face like I might disappear if she wasn't careful enough.

""Oh, Evelyn, my darling...""

Is she crying? Those were definitely tears, real tears streaming down her cheeks. My mother never cried. Not when Grandpa died, not ever in front of me.

A terrible thought struck me. ""Where's Dad? Did something happen to him? Is he okay?""

""Mom, what is it?"" I started to spiral, that familiar panic clawing up my throat. ""Why are you crying? Where's Da-""

Dad appeared in the doorway then, and he looked terrible. Unlike Mom's nightgown, he was fumbling with the buttons of his work shirt. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his hair was sticking up like he had been running his hands through it. He looked like he'd aged ten years overnight.

""Dad?"" The word came out strangled.

""I'll take her, Mary,"" he said gently, resting a protective hand on my mother's shoulder. His voice sounded hoarse, like he'd been talking all night. ""You should rest.""

""Take me where? What the hell is going on?!"" I never swore in front of my parents, but nothing about this morning was normal.

Dad's shoulders sagged like someone had piled rocks on them. When he spoke, he looked at the floor instead of at me. 

""Sweetheart... Ray had an accident last night. He wanted to see you before we need to go to the hospital.""

""What?!"" The word exploded from me. My phone vibrated off the nightstand and clattered to the floor. ""What do you mean Ray had an accident? What kind of accident? Is he okay? Tell me he's okay!""

""Yes, yes, he is,"" my mother rushed to say, but her voice was shaking and she was still crying, which didn't make any sense if he was okay. Her hands moved frantically through my hair. ""He is, dear. He is.""

""Then why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why are you both acting like this? What aren't you telling me, Dad?""

Dad looked at Mom, and something passed between them one of those silent conversations parents have when they're trying to protect you from something.

Dad said finally. ""We'll explain everything in the car.""

But they didn't explain anything in the car.

The drive to the hospital passed in heavy silence. Dad's knuckles were white against the steering wheel, and he kept checking the rearview mirror like he was afraid of something following us. Neither of us spoke every time I opened my mouth to ask a question, the look on his face stopped me.

I burst through the hospital's automatic doors, my sneakers squeaking against the polished floor. The smell hit me immediately cleaning supplies and something medicinal that made my nose burn. It was too bright inside, all fluorescent lights and white walls that hurt to look at.

""Which room is Raymond Cooper in?"" I demanded of the first nurse I saw, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and tired lines around her mouth.

My father's footsteps echoed behind me, and I could hear him breathing hard like he'd been running.

The nurse's face shifted when she heard Ray's name. Her expression became careful, professional. ""Are you family?""

""I'm his girlfriend. This is my dad."" The word 'girlfriend' felt, too small for what Ray and I actually were to each other.

She pointed toward the ICU with a gentle gesture that made my stomach drop. ""Third floor. But honey, you should speak with his family first. They're waiting up there.""

No. No, no, no.

The ICU was for serious things. Ray had an accident, but he was okay. Mom said he was okay.

The elevator ride to the third floor felt like it took forever. Dad stood beside me, his jaw clenched tight. I could see the muscle jumping underneath his skin.

""Dad,"" I whispered as we reached the third floor. ""What kind of accident?""

He looked at me with eyes that seemed older than they had been yesterday. ""Car accident, sweetheart.""

The elevator doors opened with a soft ding that sounded too cheerful for where we were.

Ray's family clustered outside the ICU like they'd been there all night. His mother was sobbing into his father's chest, not quite crying, but the kind of raw, choking sounds that come from somewhere deep inside. Her whole body shook with each breath. His father held her tight, his face buried in her hair, and his shoulders were trembling too.
Ray's little brother, Jake, sat in a plastic chair that was too big for him, his hands on his lap, his face red and swollen, and he looked so much smaller than the last time I'd seen him.

This wasn't right. None of this was right.

Ray's grandmother sat next to Jake, her weathered hands folded in her lap. She was the strong one in their family, the one who made everyone laugh at dinner and told stories about the old country. But now she looked ancient, like she'd collapsed if the breeze was a bit too strong.

I was an overthinker. Always had been. Always seeing disasters where there weren't any, making up worst-case scenarios in my head.

This was just another one of my spirals. Had to be.

We approached the family like we were walking underwater, everything slow and distorted.

Ray's uncle Tom, whose eyes usually crinkled when he smiled, stepped forward. Those same eyes were now red and hollow, like he hadn't slept in days.

""Hey, Eve..."" His voice was rough, unused.

""Ray,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Where is he? Can I see him? Are his injuries bad? What happened exactly? When did it happen? Why is everyone so upset if he's okay?""

Tom looked away, toward my dad, and I saw his eyes fill with fresh tears.

""Eve..."" His voice broke on my name like it was too heavy to say.

""He's in there, right?"" I pointed toward the ICU doors. ""I can see him, right? Did he break his legs? His arms? Is he unconscious? When will he wake up? Did they say when he'll wake up?""

The questions kept pouring out because if I stopped talking, if I let there be silence, then someone might tell me something I didn't want to hear.

""Ray broke his ribs, didn't he? That's why Mrs. Cooper is crying? Because it hurts and she doesn't like seeing him in pain? 
That's it, right?""

""Evelyn..."" Tom's voice was barely a whisper.

He swallowed hard, and I could see his throat working like he was trying not to throw up.

""Ray... Ray didn't make it, honey.""

The words hung in the air like smoke. I could see them, almost, floating between us, but they didn't make sense. They were in English, but they might as well have been in a foreign language.

I laughed.

It was a sound I'd never heard from myself before sharp and hollow and completely wrong.

""Oh. Oh! I'm dreaming, right? This is just a really bad dream,"" I heard myself say as something hot started running down my face. ""These dreams have been getting so realistic lately... It's crazy how real they feel...""

I spun toward my father and grabbed his shirt sleeve, bunching the fabric in my fists.

""Dad, you can wake me up, right? I'm sleeping upstairs in my bed, can you come wake me up? Please, Dad. I don't like this dream anymore. Please wake me up.""

""Oh, my darling,"" he whispered, wrapping his arms around me tight enough that I couldn't move. His voice sounded broken too. ""I'm here. I'm right here with you.""

But nothing was right. Ray was supposed to call me last night. Ray was supposed to pick me up at four this evening. We were supposed to go get coffee, find a poetry book for Adam, and go to the birthday party. Ray was supposed to be here, teasing me about the dress I was going to wear today, stealing sips of my coffee and complaining about having to accompany me to the bookstore on a Saturday.

""What happened?"" I asked against Dad's shirt, my voice muffled and strange. ""How did it happen?""

Tom cleared his throat. ""He‚Ä¶left early morning, saying he had an errand to run. Around five-thirty in the morning. A drunk driver ran a red light and hit him at the intersection on Pine Street.""

Pine Street. We'd walked past that intersection a thousand times. There was a stop sign there that was always crooked, and a pothole that Ray always swerved around because he was paranoid about his car.

""Was he..."" I couldn't finish the question.

""He died an hour before we called for you"" Tom said quietly.

I cried until my throat was raw, until my eyes were swollen shut, until there was nothing left inside me but an empty ache where my heart used to be. Dad held me the whole time, and I could feel him crying too, his tears falling into my hair.

Ray said he'd never leave me. He promised he'd be here even when I got old and lost my teeth. 

My Ray. My sun. The person who made everything brighter just by existing.

Gone.

September 2nd

Dennis hadn‚Äôt slept. He spent the night at the kitchen table, surrounded by papers‚Äîmaps, receipts, sketches. He drew a layout of Grayer Ridge by memory, labeled who lived where, and began compiling a timeline.

But the pieces didn‚Äôt fit. His notes from last week‚Äîthe ones where he‚Äôd written down Trevor‚Äôs favorite brand of coffee, Lena‚Äôs birthday‚Äîwere gone from his journal.

Torn out? Misplaced? Forgotten?

No. They‚Äôd been removed.

He was sure of it.

He wrote in capital letters on a fresh page:

I AM NOT CRAZY.

He underlined it. Twice.

‚∏ª

3:47 p.m.

Dennis walked to the far end of town to speak to the only person he hadn‚Äôt yet approached‚ÄîPastor Emory Cain, who ran the tiny church that squatted near the woods.

The chapel was white. The steps creaked. A perfect little Americana postcard. Too perfect.

The inside smelled like varnish and flowers that weren‚Äôt real. The pews were empty.

‚ÄúDennis,‚Äù Pastor Cain said, emerging from a side room with his sleeves rolled up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

Dennis blinked.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen newcomers start digging, they always come to me eventually.‚Äù
He smiled, but it didn‚Äôt feel welcoming. It felt prepared.

‚ÄúI have a question,‚Äù Dennis said. ‚ÄúAbout Trevor Lang.‚Äù

Pastor Cain walked slowly to the front altar and sat on its edge, folding his hands.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one here by that name.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people bring their pasts with them, Dennis. They create shadows where there are none.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre experiencing is perfectly natural.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not seeing things.‚Äù

Pastor Cain nodded slowly.

‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù

He stood, brushed imaginary dust from his sleeves.

‚ÄúWe all find peace here, Dennis. You will too. Eventually.‚Äù

Dennis left before he said something he‚Äôd regret.

Behind him, the church bell rang. Once. Sharp.
He turned back.

There was no bell tower.



Chapter 8: Echo House 

September 4th ‚Äì 6:42 PM

Dennis walked aimlessly, his breath fogging in the sharp evening air. He didn‚Äôt want to go home yet. Home felt like a lie now‚Äîlike something designed to look comforting.

He drifted toward the western ridge, where the woods thinned and the town‚Äôs perfection faltered.

That‚Äôs when he saw it: a house.

White stone, black shutters, clean angles. Like it had been sketched by a child trying to draw ‚Äúhome.‚Äù It hadn‚Äôt been there before. He was sure of it. It sat at the top of a gentle slope, surrounded by unnaturally trimmed hedges, not a single leaf out of place.

The air around it felt denser. Not cold‚Äîbut somehow heavier.

He approached slowly.

The windows were too clean. Nothing behind them. Not even curtains. Just flat glass like mirrors that didn‚Äôt want to reflect.

He stepped onto the porch.

Knocked.

Silence.

He stepped around the side. Saw something through the back window‚Äîa movement. A flicker of shadow. A shape.

He crouched, peering into the glass.

No furniture. No rugs. The inside was just blank space‚Äîlike a showroom that hadn‚Äôt yet been dressed.

And then someone stepped into the frame.

Dennis jumped back.

The door creaked open behind him.

He turned slowly.

Trevor was standing in the doorway.

Same hoodie. Same worn work boots. Same half-smile‚Äîbut it was too still, like his face was waiting for instructions.

‚ÄúDennis,‚Äù Trevor said.

Dennis stared at him.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

Trevor stepped aside slightly, holding the door open.

‚ÄúCome inside.‚Äù

Dennis didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúYou‚Äîpeople say you‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

Trevor blinked. Once. Slowly.

‚ÄúPeople say a lot of things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere have you been? I‚Äôve been looking for you. Your name isn‚Äôt even in the town records. Your house is gone. The store clerks act like they‚Äôve never heard of you. Your daughter‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been asking too many questions.‚Äù

Dennis felt cold rise in his chest.

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe to dig, Dennis. You don‚Äôt like what you‚Äôll find. Neither do they.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs they?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already know.‚Äù

Dennis looked past Trevor into the house.

The inside was wrong.

Walls that seemed too flat. A hallway that looked painted on. No smells‚Äîno furniture polish, no food, no dust. It didn‚Äôt feel lived in. It didn‚Äôt feel real.

‚ÄúIs this your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Trevor said calmly.

‚ÄúThen what is it?‚Äù

Trevor looked down for a long moment. When he looked back up, his voice was quieter.

‚ÄúSometimes the town makes things that look familiar. It helps people‚Ä¶ adjust.‚Äù

Dennis took a step back.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about, Trevor? Why are you talking like this?‚Äù

Trevor tilted his head slightly, as if listening to something Dennis couldn‚Äôt hear.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much time. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome back from where?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey erase you if you remember too much. You‚Äôre not supposed to keep people. You‚Äôre not supposed to form attachments.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs erasing who? Is this a cult? Some experiment?‚Äù

Trevor didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúWhat is this town?‚Äù

That made Trevor pause.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a process, Dennis.‚Äù

Dennis shook his head.

‚ÄúNo. No. That‚Äôs not an answer.‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs eyes were calm. Too calm. The eyes of someone who‚Äôd stopped resisting a long time ago.

‚ÄúYou need to be careful now. They know you‚Äôve started connecting things. You need to stop.‚Äù

Dennis stared at him, throat dry.

‚ÄúDid you ever even have a daughter?‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs face twitched. Just once.

‚ÄúShe was‚Ä¶ something close to that.‚Äù

Dennis‚Äôs stomach turned.

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs eyes locked on his.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking like an old world person. This town isn‚Äôt built for that. It‚Äôs not a place you live. It‚Äôs a place you become.‚Äù

Dennis stepped back again.

‚ÄúWhat do they want?‚Äù

‚ÄúObedience. Order. Forgetting.‚Äù

A breeze pushed through the trees. When Dennis looked up, clouds had swallowed the sky. The light had shifted. Like time had jumped.

When he looked back‚Äî

Trevor was gone.

The house door was shut.

He knocked again.

Nothing.

He turned the knob. Locked.

He cupped his hands to the window.

Now there was furniture. Rugs. A lamp glowing faintly in the corner.

But no people.

No Trevor.

Just a photograph sitting on the mantle.

A photo of Dennis.
Smiling.
Standing next to Trevor and Lena.
All three looking perfectly happy.

He stumbled back from the glass, breath short.

And realized‚Äî

He was wearing the same clothes as in the photo.


Chapter 9: Under Review

September 4th ‚Äì 10:33 PM

Dennis didn‚Äôt remember walking home. The streetlights blinked on one by one as he moved through the perfect little town, too fast, heart racing.

He didn‚Äôt look at the houses.
Didn‚Äôt want to see what had changed.
He just wanted to be inside. Alone.
Safe‚Äîif such a thing still existed in Grayer Ridge.

He locked every door behind him. Twice. Drew the curtains. Shut off the lights and paced the living room, running the same questions through his head like a scratched record.

Trevor had been there.
He‚Äôd spoken in riddles‚Äîwords soaked in quiet fear.
He‚Äôd said:

‚ÄúThe town isn‚Äôt a place. It‚Äôs a process.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey erase you if you remember too much.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to keep people.‚Äù

What the hell did that mean?

And that photo‚Äî
Dennis standing next to Trevor and Lena, smiling like he belonged.

But he didn‚Äôt remember the picture being taken.
He didn‚Äôt remember ever posing for it.
And his smile had looked off. Too wide. Like it had been designed.

He didn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôd been holding his breath until he exhaled‚Äîshaky, cold.

Somewhere deep in the walls, the house gave a faint creak.

Then another.

Then a knock at the door.

Dennis froze.

He hadn‚Äôt heard footsteps. No car. No gravel shifting.

Just the knock.
Soft. Rhythmic.
Three slow taps.

He didn‚Äôt move.

Another knock.

He crossed the living room and peered through the peephole.

A man in a black wool coat stood on the porch. Tall. Clean-shaven. Thin, but not sickly. His hair was dark and slicked, parted precisely. Hands clasped behind his back.

He wasn‚Äôt from the town. Dennis was certain of that.

But he smiled like someone who belonged.

Dennis hesitated. Then opened the door just a crack, leaving the chain on.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù the man said warmly, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre Dennis.‚Äù

His voice was smooth. Neutral. Like it had been practiced.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust someone checking in. May I come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right. I don‚Äôt mind talking from here.‚Äù

Dennis narrowed his eyes.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not with the HOA, are you?‚Äù

The man laughed softly.

‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what do you want?‚Äù

The man tilted his head slightly, studying Dennis like he was a puzzle missing one final piece.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve noticed you‚Äôve been a bit‚Ä¶ active lately. Asking questions. Visiting places that weren‚Äôt on your initial map.‚Äù

Dennis said nothing.

The man continued.

‚ÄúUnderstand, Dennis, the town operates best when its residents accept the rhythm. When they become part of the flow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this town?‚Äù Dennis asked.

The man offered a smile that never reached his eyes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a structured environment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only one that fits.‚Äù

Dennis felt his pulse pounding behind his eyes.

‚ÄúTrevor was real. He was here. His daughter was too. I remember them.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù the man asked. ‚ÄúMemory is malleable. Especially here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù

The man leaned forward, just slightly.

‚ÄúNothing. Yet.‚Äù

His eyes gleamed‚Äîsomething inhuman behind them, not supernatural, but clinical. As if Dennis were data being analyzed in real-time.

‚ÄúYou are currently under review. That‚Äôs all. No need for alarm.‚Äù

‚ÄúReview for what?‚Äù

The man looked past Dennis, into the house. His smile widened just a hair.

‚ÄúFor compatibility.‚Äù

The phrase hit Dennis in the chest like a cold splash.

‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAdjustment takes time. Some residents never fully integrate. Some resist. That‚Äôs natural.‚Äù

Dennis gripped the doorframe.

‚ÄúI want to leave.‚Äù

The man nodded, as if that was expected.

‚ÄúMany do, at first. But departures are rarely productive. The system requires continuity. You‚Äôre part of a structure now, Dennis.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt agree to this.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

That question stayed in the air far too long.

The man straightened his coat.

‚ÄúNo further action is required at this time. Continue your routine. Be social. Eat well. Sleep. Try not to fixate on inconsistencies. They have a way of multiplying.‚Äù

He stepped back from the porch.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be in touch.‚Äù

And then he turned and walked‚Äînot down the driveway, but into the yard, disappearing behind the hedges. No sound. No crunch of grass. Just gone.

Dennis stood at the door for nearly a full minute, then slammed it shut and bolted every lock.

In the silence of the house, he heard something faint‚Äîbarely audible.

A mechanical hum.

Not from outside.

From inside the walls.

Almost like‚Ä¶ cooling fans.

Or a server rack.

He put his ear to the drywall.

The hum stopped instantly.

He sat on the couch in the dark, hands trembling, the words echoing:

‚ÄúYou are currently under review.‚Äù

And on the window, barely visible in the reflection of the TV screen, he saw a new sticker he hadn‚Äôt noticed before‚Äîplaced perfectly in the corner of the glass:

A circle with a line through it.

Chapter 10: Unremembering

September 9th ‚Äì 7:02 AM

Dennis woke up standing.

In the kitchen.

The kettle was hissing. A mug was already on the counter. The spoon inside clinked softly, as though it had just stirred itself.

His phone sat face down beside it, screen still glowing.

A text was open:

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôll be a little late. Don‚Äôt wait on me. -T‚Äù

T?

Trevor?

He hadn‚Äôt texted Trevor. Trevor didn‚Äôt even have a number anymore.

Dennis stared at the message, his thumb hovering just above it, hesitant to touch.

What had he been doing for the last hour?

He‚Äôd gotten out of bed, clearly. Boiled water. Texted someone. But he remembered none of it. Like it had been done for him, through him.

His coffee was scalding when he drank it. Too hot. He hadn‚Äôt poured cream or sugar. But his stomach turned as if he had‚Äîlike his body remembered a choice he hadn‚Äôt made.

He looked at the time again.

7:02 AM.

The last thing he remembered was brushing his teeth at 5:38.

‚∏ª

September 9th ‚Äì 2:12 PM

Dennis stepped outside for air.

Three houses down, where the Perrys had lived, a moving truck sat in the driveway. But it was parked backwards, engine still idling, no one in the cab.

Boxes were on the lawn. All sealed with white tape. Not brown. White. Not labeled.

A couple stood on the porch, chatting with Marcy from next door. The man wore a deep burgundy cardigan and smiled without blinking. The woman held a pie, unmoving in her hands, like a prop.

They both turned toward Dennis in perfect unison.

Smiled.

Held the smiles for too long.

He forced a wave and went back inside.

‚∏ª

September 10th ‚Äì 6:45 PM

Trevor‚Äôs house still stood at the edge of the woods.

Dennis didn‚Äôt remember the path there. Just found himself walking it, as if something in him had decided it already.

He paused at the edge of the trees, watching the white stone glow faintly in the fading daylight.

It looked different again.

Now there was a chimney, though he didn‚Äôt remember one before. And the color of the trim had changed‚Äînow a pale, sterile green, the same as the clinic back in town.

The air around the house always felt heavy. But tonight it was worse. Not just thick‚Äîdense with something intentional, like the space itself was folded.

He knocked.

No answer.

He turned the knob. Unlocked.

Inside was colder than he expected.

The walls had pictures now. Not family photos, but portraits of strangers‚Äîdozens of them, all framed identically. Neutral expressions. Almost like ID photos. None smiling.

The furniture was arranged like a waiting room. Identical armchairs facing a central rug. No personal touches. No toys. No mail. No fingerprints.

But a faint warmth lingered in the air, like someone had just left.

He stepped deeper.

Down the hallway, a door was open that hadn‚Äôt been open before.

Inside was a child‚Äôs bedroom.

The walls were powder blue. A small bed in the corner. A single book on the floor, spine cracked: Names for the New Century.

He reached for it.

Footsteps.

Behind him.
Soft.
Deliberate.

He turned‚Äî

Nothing.

The air shifted behind him, and he turned back.

The book was gone.

The bed made.

Room silent.

Dennis stood frozen, the cold of the room settling in layers beneath his skin. He hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt blinked, but everything was different. The book was gone. The bed made. Even the faint impression on the carpet where he‚Äôd stepped in was no longer there, as though the room had reset.

He slowly backed into the hallway.

But now, the hallway was longer.

It stretched deeper into the house than he remembered. Much deeper. A faint hum echoed from somewhere ahead‚Äîlow, pulsing, mechanical, but not like any machine he could name. The air here buzzed against his skin like static. He could smell‚Ä¶ ozone, or maybe disinfectant. His own breath sounded too loud.

He turned back toward the front door‚Äîonly it wasn‚Äôt there.

Just wall.

He wasn‚Äôt sure when it had vanished.

Behind him, the hum grew sharper, like it was tuning itself to him.

Dennis moved, or thought he did. The hallway blurred. He passed doors that hadn‚Äôt existed a moment ago‚Äîeach one identical, evenly spaced. He tried to open one‚Äîlocked. Another‚Äîlocked. On the third, he pressed his ear against the wood and heard nothing, then suddenly‚Äî

His own voice.

Speaking.

From inside.

He stumbled back, heart pounding.

The door opened on its own.

Inside: a dining room, but not his own. Not Trevor‚Äôs either. A long wooden table, perfectly set for twelve, untouched. Every chair had a name card in elegant script.

He stepped closer.

The name in front of the nearest chair read: DENNIS CALLOWAY

The rest were blank.

He reached for the card, but just as his fingers brushed it‚Äî

Darkness.

A blink? A blackout?

When Dennis opened his eyes again, he was lying on his couch at home. Fully clothed. Shoes on.

The TV was on, playing static.

The coaster with the circle-and-line symbol sat on the coffee table, but now there were two.

And next to them:

The book.

Names for the New Century.

Its spine was still cracked.

And it was open now.

To a page he didn‚Äôt remember flipping to.

A page with one name, underlined multiple times in faded ink:
Dennis Calloway

He hadn‚Äôt written it. The handwriting was too neat, too formal. But the ink looked‚Ä¶ old. Almost like it had been there before the book even reached him.

He closed it slowly, the weight of the paper cold in his hands.

It wasn‚Äôt the book that unsettled him. It was the feeling he‚Äôd seen it before‚Äîmaybe not here. Maybe not in this house. But somewhere.

Somewhen.

And Dennis‚Ä¶
Dennis didn‚Äôt remember coming home.
Didn‚Äôt remember leaving the house.
Didn‚Äôt even remember falling asleep.

Just static. And a whisper of a thought he couldn‚Äôt pin down‚Äî

August 9th

Trevor Lang became the first person Dennis truly liked in Grayer Ridge.

It started with the porch railing.

‚ÄúThat corner post is loose,‚Äù Trevor said casually, leaning on the fence one morning. ‚ÄúHouse‚Äôll look at you funny if you let that go too long.‚Äù

Dennis laughed.

‚ÄúYou think the house has opinions?‚Äù

‚ÄúMost places do. But this one‚Ä¶ yeah. Definitely.‚Äù

Trevor returned later with tools. Said he wouldn‚Äôt take payment. He had the quiet, focused energy of a man used to doing things with his hands. When he worked, he whistled‚Äînot tuneless, not loud, but careful. Like he didn‚Äôt want to disturb something listening nearby.

Dennis offered him iced tea. They sat on the porch.

‚ÄúYou grew up here?‚Äù Dennis asked.

Trevor nodded.

‚ÄúLeft for a while. Came back when my girl was born. She‚Äôs the only reason I stuck around.‚Äù

He said it like a confession. Like someone telling you they didn‚Äôt believe in ghosts‚Äîbut always turned on a light before walking into a dark room.

‚∏ª

August 13th ‚Äì Dinner

Trevor invited Dennis over for dinner the following week.

His house, just a short walk away, was modest. Cozy. Lived-in. A faded blue exterior. Wind chimes on the porch made from old silverware. Inside, everything smelled like rosemary and warm bread.

His daughter, Lena, was 11. Sharp-eyed, quiet, watching Dennis like he was a puzzle piece that didn‚Äôt fit yet.

‚ÄúYou really live in the Hollow House?‚Äù she asked between bites of stew.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they‚Äôre calling it now?‚Äù Dennis smirked.

‚ÄúThey always call it something,‚Äù Trevor said, setting down his glass. ‚ÄúBack when I was a kid, they just called it The Last Stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds dramatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is. Town likes its stories.‚Äù

Lena didn‚Äôt laugh. She stared into her bowl.

‚ÄúDo you hear it at night?‚Äù she asked, not looking up.
‚ÄúThe sound like someone sweeping upstairs?‚Äù

Dennis felt a chill in his throat.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he lied. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt heard anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said, still not smiling. ‚ÄúThat means it hasn‚Äôt started yet.‚Äù

Trevor put a hand on her shoulder. She flinched‚Äîjust slightly.

‚∏ª

Chapter 5: Familiar Faces

August 16th ‚Äì August 28th

Dennis began spending more time with Trevor. Not daily‚Äîbut often enough that it became a rhythm. Sometimes they walked in the woods behind the Ridge. Sometimes they shared coffee on the porch.

Trevor was the only one who didn‚Äôt perform friendliness. He never asked questions that felt rehearsed. He never smiled too long. He cursed when he stubbed his toe. He rubbed his eyes when he was tired.

Normal.

‚∏ª

Trust

‚ÄúEveryone here pretending?‚Äù Dennis asked one night over a beer.
‚ÄúFeels like a play I wasn‚Äôt cast in.‚Äù

Trevor looked up at the moon.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing. Everyone here wants to be in the play. You‚Äôre just not reading the script.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt trust them either?‚Äù

Trevor hesitated. That pause again. Carefully timed.

‚ÄúI trust them to do what they‚Äôre told. That‚Äôs worse, in some ways.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Lena

Lena started walking over after school. Sometimes she‚Äôd read on Dennis‚Äôs porch swing while he worked on his manuscript. Other times she‚Äôd ask odd, clipped questions:

‚ÄúHave you found the room yet?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you dream in color or not here?‚Äù
‚ÄúWould you stay if they told you not to?‚Äù

Dennis chalked it up to imagination. Or trauma. Or both.
She was a quiet kid in a quiet town. Who wouldn‚Äôt act a little weird?

Still, one afternoon, he asked:

‚ÄúWhy do you always ask me questions like that?‚Äù

She looked up, entirely blank-faced.

‚ÄúBecause they want to know.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The Growing Dread

Dennis started to notice more.
	‚Ä¢	The same man watering the same lawn looked identical from three houses down‚Äîbut his clothes were never wrinkled, and he never spoke.
	‚Ä¢	The caf√© now served the same soup every day. When he asked if it changed, the server blinked, then said: ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs ever asked that before.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	When Dennis walked into the florist one morning, the woman inside stopped mid-conversation, turned to him, and smiled too wide.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here a month,‚Äù she said, though he hadn‚Äôt told her.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the time it starts.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Trevor‚Äôs Garage

One night, Dennis stepped into Trevor‚Äôs garage looking for him. Trevor wasn‚Äôt home, but the door was open.

There were shelves of tools. Blueprints. Maps of the town. Dozens of them. All annotated in pencil‚Äîdates, numbers, circled intersections. Red lines led to spots labeled:

‚ÄúENTRY?‚Äù
‚ÄúDOOR?‚Äù
‚ÄúVOICE?‚Äù

He found a drawer full of Polaroids. All of them showed the same view: Dennis‚Äôs front porch. Taken at night. From a distance. One had a date‚ÄîJuly 28th‚Äîa day before Dennis had officially moved in.

Another showed him standing in his upstairs window.
He didn‚Äôt remember ever standing there.

Trevor returned just as Dennis was shutting the drawer.

‚ÄúSorry. Door was open. I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî‚Äù

Trevor‚Äôs eyes didn‚Äôt narrow. His tone didn‚Äôt change. But something in his face went still.

‚ÄúSome things you look for because you‚Äôre curious,‚Äù he said slowly.
‚ÄúSome things you look for because you want them to look back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are there pictures of my house?‚Äù Dennis asked.

‚ÄúYou should go home now, Dennis.‚Äù

‚∏ª

But He Didn‚Äôt

That night, Dennis stayed up past 3 a.m., watching the woods from his bedroom window.

He saw Lena. Alone. Standing just beyond the edge of the trees.
Motionless. Staring at the house.

Not waving.
Just watching.

He called Trevor the next morning.
No answer.

He walked to their house.
Empty.

Not ‚Äúmoved out‚Äù empty.
Stripped.

No furniture. No curtains. No smell of rosemary.
Like they‚Äôd never lived there.


Chapter 6: Echoes

August 30th
Dennis knocked on Trevor‚Äôs door again that morning, even though he knew no one would answer. The house looked wrong now. Not empty‚Äîunclaimed.

The windows were shut. The curtains gone. A thin film of dust coated the doorknob.

But yesterday, just yesterday, there had been bread baking. Lena had been sitting on the porch swing reading Bridge to Terabithia. The wind had chimes in it.

Now: nothing. No swing. No sound.

Dennis walked around the house. Every window showed the same thing‚Äîbare floors, clean walls. No sign that anyone had ever lived there.

He circled the property three times before finally walking into town.

‚∏ª

Inquiries

The Sill Caf√©. 10:42 a.m.

Dennis approached the counter. The same barista as always‚Äîshort brown hair, freckles, name tag that read Anna. Always smiling.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ weird question,‚Äù Dennis said, trying to keep it light.
‚ÄúDo you know where Trevor Lang is?‚Äù

She tilted her head slightly. Smile held. No blink.

‚ÄúTrevor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Guy who lives near the Hollow House. Has a daughter named Lena.‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I know who that is.‚Äù

‚ÄúTall guy. Kind of quiet. Fixes stuff. You‚Äôve definitely seen him. He‚Äôs been in here with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must be thinking of someone else.‚Äù
Smile. Slight lean forward. ‚ÄúYou should try the cinnamon muffins today. They‚Äôre fresh.‚Äù

Dennis stared at her.
She didn‚Äôt break eye contact. Not once.

‚∏ª

The Delling Garden

12:15 p.m.

Mara Delling was pruning stalks of something purple and crawling when Dennis approached her fence.

‚ÄúMara,‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúDid you know Trevor Lang?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt turn.

‚ÄúTrevor,‚Äù he said again. ‚ÄúLives three houses down. Blue-gray house. Daughter named Lena.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat house has been empty since the McAllisters left,‚Äù she said, not looking at him.
‚ÄúBefore you arrived.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she asked, standing upright finally. She turned slowly to face him.
Her eyes‚ÄîDennis noticed it then. Something behind them. Like looking into the surface of a lake that was too still.
No depth. No reflection. Just‚Ä¶ a screen.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I like these questions, Dennis,‚Äù she added gently. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe fixed my porch,‚Äù Dennis snapped. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had dinner in his house. I‚Äôve talked to his daughter. You talked to him too.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must be remembering something else,‚Äù she said, and smiled so softly it made his chest ache.
‚ÄúPeople like us need quiet.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The General Store

Dennis tore through shelves looking for something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat connected Trevor to the town. A receipt. A note. A posted photo. A mention. Nothing.

He grabbed the store owner‚Äîa man with a waxed mustache and perfect posture‚Äîby the counter.

‚ÄúTrevor Lang,‚Äù Dennis demanded. ‚ÄúYou know that name. He buys parts from here. Screws. Nails. Oil for his truck. You‚Äôve seen him.‚Äù

The man blinked once, twice. Then again‚Äîtoo fast.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou should rest.‚Äù

Dennis stormed out.

‚∏ª

Proof

That night, Dennis tore apart his home. He knew there had to be something.

And he found it.

In the back of a kitchen drawer, beneath a phone charger and old batteries, was a photo. A Polaroid. Slightly faded.

Dennis and Trevor. On the porch. Holding beers. Laughing.

Dennis stared at it for ten minutes. His fingers trembled. This was real. It had to be.

He flipped it over. On the back, in blocky handwriting:

‚ÄúJuly 30th. Looks like you‚Äôll settle in just fine.‚Äù ‚Äî T.

Dennis sat down hard in the middle of the kitchen floor.

And then he noticed something.

His own face in the photo was clear. Smiling.

Trevor‚Äôs face, though‚Äî

‚Äîblurred.

Not out of focus. Not motion blur. But like it had been smeared. Soft-edged. Smudged‚Äîas if the camera couldn‚Äôt decide what to show.

He ran his thumb across the image.

It was smooth. Not damaged.

Just‚Ä¶wrong.

‚∏ª

The People

The next day, Dennis walked through town watching people. Really watching them.

And he saw it.

Not a feature. Not a gesture. But a kind of absence. The eyes‚Äîyes‚Äîbut more than that. Like the people here were wearing their faces instead of having them.

He passed a man watering his lawn who turned slightly too late when Dennis called his name.
The man waved‚Äîbut not at him.
At nothing. Then went back to watering.
There was no hose.

At the library, a woman filed the same book three times in a row‚Äîalphabetically wrong each time.

At 2:17 p.m., everyone in town turned their heads east at the same time. Held it for three seconds. Then moved on like nothing happened.

Dennis counted. Eighteen people. Same second. All turned. All turned back.

No one else reacted.",1,1754658853.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Visit

July 27th

Dennis Whitaker didn‚Äôt think of it as running away‚Äîjust repositioning. Resetting.

After the divorce, the layoff, and that one week in May where he didn‚Äôt leave the apartment except to buy coffee and return to bed, something had snapped. Not in a dramatic way. Quietly. Like a rubber band losing its tension.

He found the ad on a forum for vintage architecture. A user named H. Dreven had posted about a house:

‚Äú1880s Victorian in pristine condition. Located in Grayer Ridge, WA. Ideal for quiet living. Great light, great bones. Ideal for writers, artists, and solitary types.‚Äù

No phone number. Just an email.
Dennis sent a message on a whim. Got a reply that same night.

‚ÄúCome see it for yourself. House shows better in person.‚Äù
Directions were attached. Hand-written. Strangely specific.
‚ÄúAvoid GPS. Turn left at the white fence, not the stone one. You‚Äôll see a red mailbox‚Äîignore it.‚Äù

‚∏ª

July 29th ‚Äì Grayer Ridge, Washington

The first thing Dennis noticed was the air‚Äîcleaner than he was used to, like it had just rained even though the skies were clear.

Grayer Ridge emerged through a bend in the road, tucked into a green hollow surrounded by forest. At first glance, it was idyllic. Almost aggressively so.

The houses were color-coordinated‚Äîcheerful yellows, soft blues, pale greens. Lawns were perfectly trimmed. No weeds. Flower boxes overflowed with bright, chirping color. Even the sidewalks looked swept.

There was a vintage barbershop with a rotating pole. A general store with candy in glass jars. A caf√© where every umbrella was perfectly centered above each table.

No chain stores. No traffic. Just people. Walking. Smiling. Waving.
Too friendly. Too‚Ä¶timed.

‚∏ª

The House on Ashbone Lane

Dennis followed a narrow drive to the end of Ashbone Lane, where the houses thinned into a grove of silver pines. His future home stood proudly behind a black iron gate:

Number 38.

It was beautiful. Three stories, cream-colored siding, hunter-green trim, deep wraparound porch with two white rocking chairs that didn‚Äôt creak or sway. The glass was clean. The roof looked new.

Perfect. Too perfect.
He felt like he was stepping into a catalog.

The key was under a stone frog statue on the porch.
Exactly where Dreven had said it would be.

‚∏ª

Inside

The inside smelled faintly of cedar and lemon polish. Not a speck of dust. The hardwood floors gleamed. The walls were pale eggshell and crisp white. Every room was flooded with natural light.

There was a sunroom with tall, arched windows. A reading nook built into the stairwell. A fireplace framed in green tile, flanked by shelves stocked with hardcovers. It looked like it belonged in a magazine‚Äîstaged, but not lived in.

Dennis ran a hand across the countertop in the kitchen. Granite. Not a single fingerprint. The fridge was unplugged. The pantry empty. But everything was clean. Ready.

The attic door didn‚Äôt budge when he tried it, but it didn‚Äôt feel threatening. Just old. Settled.

The perfection of it all made something tighten in his stomach. It felt prepared. Like it had been waiting for him.

‚∏ª

Meeting Dreven

He met H. Dreven at a shaded patio table outside the caf√©. The man was tall, long-faced, with thin fingers and a low, precise voice. He wore an old-fashioned pocket watch and never looked directly at Dennis.

‚ÄúThe house suits you,‚Äù Dreven said. ‚ÄúYou seem like someone who likes things in order.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù Dennis admitted. ‚ÄúHonestly, I expected it to be falling apart for this price.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been taken care of,‚Äù Dreven said, brushing something invisible from the table.
‚ÄúHomes like this‚Äîold ones‚Äîthey do better when someone‚Äôs watching over them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù

Dreven didn‚Äôt laugh. He just blinked slowly.

‚ÄúNo catch. Just rules. Keep the windows shut on windy nights. And don‚Äôt dig in the back garden.‚Äù

Dennis waited for more, but Dreven stood. Transaction over.

‚ÄúPeople here value quiet,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll fit in.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Chapter 2: Settling In

August 2nd

Dennis arrived with a moving van and a checklist. He didn‚Äôt bring much‚Äîbooks, clothes, a turntable, his writing setup. He was going to take this seriously. Focus. Finish the novel he hadn‚Äôt touched in two years.

Grayer Ridge welcomed him with sunshine and polite nods.

The same children rode bikes past the same picket fences. Same man watering the same roses. Same couple walking a fluffy white dog‚Äîmorning, noon, and night.

No one seemed hurried. No one ever looked at their phones.

‚∏ª

The House

The house was exactly as he left it. No strange noises. No cold spots. No creaks. Just space and light. It didn‚Äôt feel haunted. It didn‚Äôt feel alive.

It felt‚Ä¶ ready.

By the third night, he noticed something odd.

Every night at 9:06 PM, the porch light clicked on by itself. He hadn‚Äôt set a timer.

He told himself it was probably on a sensor. Nothing unusual.

Still, he logged it in his notebook.

‚∏ª

Chapter 3: The Neighbors

August 5th

That morning, Dennis met Mara Delling‚Äîa sharp-eyed woman in her 60s with silvery hair and long skirts. She offered him a jar of plum preserves.

‚ÄúFor your mornings. Helps the dreams settle,‚Äù she said with a small smile.

‚ÄúYou make this yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy late sister‚Äôs recipe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe still watches the stove, I think.‚Äù

Dennis laughed lightly, but Mara didn‚Äôt. She just nodded and looked up at the house.

‚ÄúThat place always finds someone.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt ask what she meant.

‚∏ª

Later that week, he met Trevor Lang, a mechanic who lived three houses down. He was tall, balding, and always seemed to be wearing gloves‚Äîeven when drinking coffee.

‚ÄúPlace looks good,‚Äù Trevor said, eyeing the house.
‚ÄúBetter than it used to. Funny how it cleans up for some folks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know who lived there before?‚Äù

Trevor shook his head.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter now. You‚Äôre here. That‚Äôs the important part.‚Äù

He stared at Dennis for a moment too long before adding:

‚ÄúYou sleep okay? First few weeks can be‚Ä¶ loud.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs been quiet,‚Äù Dennis said.

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù Trevor smiled.
‚ÄúGive it time.‚Äù

‚∏ª

More Neighbors

On August 7th, Dennis met Lyle and Catherine Wren, a couple in their early 40s who lived across the green.

They were nice. Too nice.

They brought him a covered dish‚Äîcasserole of some kind‚Äîand asked to come inside.

‚ÄúWe just love what you‚Äôve done with it already,‚Äù Catherine said, though he hadn‚Äôt changed a thing.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think the house would choose someone so young,‚Äù Lyle added with a warm smile.
‚ÄúUsually takes to widows. Or quiet types.‚Äù

Dennis laughed, uncertain.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòchoose‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, just neighborhood talk,‚Äù Catherine said, brushing her hand through the air like smoke.
‚ÄúOld houses have character. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù

They stayed too long. When they finally left, Dennis watched them walk in perfect unison down the street until they rounded the corner and vanished‚Äîtoo fast.

‚∏ª

Things That Don‚Äôt Sit Right
	‚Ä¢	Every morning, the birds outside chirp in the same rhythm. Like a loop.
	‚Ä¢	The mailman walks by but never delivers anything.
	‚Ä¢	A black cat appears on the porch at 3:33 AM. It doesn‚Äôt leave paw prints.
	‚Ä¢	A humming sound comes from the walls. Not loud. Just there.

Dennis tries to ignore it. He tells himself it‚Äôs just the stress of the move. The silence after city life. But something isn‚Äôt settling right.

Not with the neighbors.
Not with the town.
And especially not with the house that doesn‚Äôt need fixing.",1,1754658833.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1mkuucu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mkuucu/could_aeropress_go_be_the_best_portable_french/,Could AeroPress Go Be the Best Portable French Press Coffee Maker Review?,"Testing out the AeroPress 15A01 Coffee Maker has been an unexpectedly delightful journey. As someone who cares deeply about their morning coffee ritual, finding a product that combines portability, versatility, and legitimate coffee quality isn‚Äôt easy. This little coffee press claims big things‚Äîlike brewing a full-bodied cup of joe without bitterness or grit‚Äîeven while on the go. Naturally, I had to see if it lived up to the hype, and believe me, I went all-in on testing its features.

**Design and Built Quality**  
The compact design of this coffee press is the first thing that caught my eye. Measuring just 4.2‚Äù x 4.2‚Äù x 7.3‚Äù and weighing only 11.2 ounces, it‚Äôs extremely travel-friendly. The included mug and lid doubling as a travel case is a thoughtful touch, and I found it super convenient, especially on camping trips and vacations. The material feels sturdy, with a matte exterior finish that's both stylish and practical‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt show smudges easily. The BPA- and phthalate-free materials give me confidence in using it day in and day out without worrying about health risks. Simple to pack, durable enough for hikes, and just the right size to toss in a bag, the design screams portability without feeling flimsy.

**Performance: Brewing the Perfect Cup**  
I‚Äôve experimented with countless brewing methods over the years, from traditional French presses to high-tech espresso machines, but the process with this coffee maker is undeniably easy and quick. You just add coffee and water, give it a stir, and press. Brewing time is about a minute for hot coffee or a quick two minutes for cold brew. The result? A rich, grit-free cup of coffee that‚Äôs genuinely smooth. Unlike traditional French presses, it avoids bitterness, delivering a clean-tasting espresso-style coffee with remarkable consistency. I even used it to make lattes and cappuccinos by pressing out espresso shots, and the results were satisfying every single time. I have to say, controlling the coffee-water ratio allowed me to create a strong brew one day and a milder, more mellow cup the next.  

[Time to see AeroPress 15A01 cost on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07yvl8sf3/)

**Pros**  
There‚Äôs a lot to praise about the coffee press, particularly when it comes to its standout features.  

- Lightweight and portable design is perfect for travel or outdoor activities.  
- Hassle-free cleaning takes just seconds‚Äîno complicated maintenance.  
- Versatile brewing options: hot coffee, espresso shots, and cold brew.  
- Produces coffee with a smooth finish‚Äîno bitterness or leftover grit.  
- Durable and BPA-free materials make it feel safe and reliable.  

**Drawbacks**  
That being said, no product is without its flaws, and I found a few quirks worth mentioning:  

- The use of paper filters can create waste if you're not careful about disposal.  
- Its small size limits larger batch brewing; you can only make 1-3 cups at a time.  
- Manual pressing can be awkward initially, especially for someone new to this method.  

**Ease of Use: A True Beginner-Friendly Device**  
Being entirely manual, the AeroPress Go doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with choices or buttons. My niece, who‚Äôs never used a coffee maker before, managed to whip up a passable cup with no help from me! All you need is ground coffee (I recommend medium-fine), water, and 60 seconds. The minimal cleanup effort afterward is the cherry on top‚Äîit‚Äôs ideal for anyone with a tight morning schedule.

**Competing Brands**  
I‚Äôve tried other portable coffee makers, like the Wacaco Nanopresso and Bodum Travel Press, both of which have their merits. The Wacaco is slightly more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù in its feel and is tailored explicitly for those chasing a true espresso shot. However, the effort to grind beans fine enough and clean it afterward isn‚Äôt for everyone. On the other hand, the Bodum Travel Press is just as portable but can leave behind some gritty residue since it lacks the AeroPress‚Äô paper filter system. Compared to these, the AeroPress excels in producing clean, grit-free coffee with minimal effort. That said, those wanting a larger capacity might lean towards other options.

**Value for Money**  
Assessing what this little coffee press delivers versus its cost, I‚Äôd have to say it‚Äôs worth every penny. Its versatility in brewing methods, portability, and overall build quality offer solid justification for its price point. For campers, road trippers, or anyone seeking an instant caffeine fix without compromising flavor, it‚Äôs a reasonably priced gadget that pays for itself in convenience and flavor.

## Key features Analysis

The modern 5-gallon water cooler boasts a range of features designed to enhance user experience and functionality.Here's a detailed look at some of the most important specifications.**Cooling capacity:** The cooling capacity of a water cooler is paramount, especially in environments with high demand. this refers to the amount of cold water the cooler can dispense per hour.

A high-performance cooler should be able to chill at least 1.5 gallons of water per hour to a temperature range of 40-50¬∞F (4-10¬∞C). this ensures a continuous supply of cold water, even during peak usage times.Consider models with adjustable temperature settings to customize the coolness to your preference. The cooling capacity is directly related to the compressor size and insulation quality, so opting for models with efficient components is crucial.**Heating Capacity:** For those who enjoy hot beverages, the heating capacity is equally critically important. This specifies how much hot water the cooler can dispense per hour and the temperature range it can achieve.A typical 5-gallon water cooler should be able to heat at least 1 gallon of water per hour to a temperature between 180-200¬∞F (82-93¬∞C). This is ideal for making tea,coffee,or instant soups. Look for models with safety features like childproof hot water taps to prevent accidental burns.Advanced models may offer programmable heating schedules to conserve energy during off-peak hours.**Material and Construction:** The materials used in a water cooler's construction impact its durability, hygiene, and overall aesthetic.

High-quality water coolers typically feature food-grade stainless steel water tanks and BPA-free plastic components. Stainless steel tanks are resistant to corrosion and bacterial growth, ensuring clean and safe drinking water. The outer casing should be made of durable, impact-resistant plastic to withstand daily wear and tear.Consider models with removable drip trays for easy cleaning and maintenance.

**Filtration System:** Many modern water coolers incorporate filtration systems to improve water quality and taste.

These systems often use activated carbon filters to remove chlorine, sediment, and other impurities from the water. Some advanced models employ multi-stage filtration, including sediment filters, carbon block filters, and UV sterilization, for superior purification. the filtration system's effectiveness depends on the type of filter used and the frequency of filter replacement. Regularly replacing filters is crucial to maintain optimal water quality.**Energy Efficiency:** Energy efficiency is a growing concern for consumers, and water coolers are no exception.

Look for models with Energy Star certification, which indicates they meet strict energy efficiency guidelines. These coolers often incorporate features like improved insulation, efficient compressors, and programmable timers to minimize energy consumption. Consider models with sleep modes or automatic shut-off features to further reduce energy waste when the cooler is not in use.

**dispensing Mechanism:** the dispensing mechanism should be user-pleasant, hygienic, and durable.

Water coolers typically feature button, lever, or touchless dispensing systems. Button and lever systems are common and reliable, while touchless dispensing offers enhanced hygiene by reducing contact with the cooler. Look for models with spill-proof dispensing nozzles and removable drip trays for easy cleaning. the dispensing mechanism should be robust enough to withstand frequent use without leaking or malfunctioning.

1mkuqo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mkuqo8/i_think_i_am_done/,I think i am done.,"Ive spent the last decade rebuilding my life from the ashes of a long term relationship that ended at the altar. Got a better job, therapy, friends, and life has been good. Peaceful. Didnt date or talk to the opposite gender or interact with them because i was just done and ready to be alone. I was happy. Or maybe isolated. 

Life always throws us a curveball doesnt it? I saw someone. He was like me. Spoke to no one. Kept to himself. He was a wallflower, or so he thought. But i watched him (yeah like a joe goldberg) for months at work. He was kind. Patient. Hurt. He was me. We are so similar. Its crazy how it was like we were living parallel lives. I spoke to him. Who knew it'd be the downfall that was waiting for me all along. Years of avoidant walls fell in 3 seconds the first time we had coffee. Years of avoiding love and people caught up and opened up like a burst dam. I was in love that first time. I thought it was an unrequited crush, or worse, limerence. Wrong. He likes me too. Alot it seems. But he too is recovering from a toxic relationship. Fresh off the boat so he couldn't attach to me any more than a close friend. Didnt stop him from being physical with me that night. I dont regret it. Maybe i should. 

We spend time together now. We act like a couple behind closed doors. But i can tell he is just here so that im not alone. Not because he wants to. I feel like a charity case. I should walk away but im so addicted to his presence. And im a world class champion at cutting everyone off so i dont understand why i cant do it to him. 

Few weeks have passed. My life has become a mess. I have unpaid bills. A wrecked home. I havent been to work. I havent seen any of my friends. I havent eaten in days. I think im having a nervous breakdown. I feel suicidal every moment. And im so tempted to jump off the ledge. 

Im being pathetic rn i know. I should be able to pull myself together like a proper adult that i was but i think ive lost the battle against life. People have actual problems and here i am whining about wanting to die because my unhealed parts finally surfaced. I dont know if ill go thru with offing myself. But i wanted someone to hear me out.  I hope I get better soon. But i think i am done.",2,1754658476.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.75,False
1mkuqls,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mkuqls/find_out_if_hamilton_beach_the_scoop_single_serve/,Find Out If Hamilton Beach The Scoop Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Delivers Quality,"**Testing the Hamilton Beach 49981A Single-Serve Brewer**  

I‚Äôve been brewing coffee every single morning for years, and the Hamilton Beach 49981A Single-Serve Brewer quickly became a fascinating addition to my kitchen. Its stainless steel construction caught my eye immediately. There‚Äôs something about the metallic finish that suggests durability while still looking sleek on my countertop. I decided to put this coffee maker to the test‚Äîand boy, was it an experience worth talking about!

**Design and Build Quality**  

One of the first things I noticed was its compact and modern design. Measuring only 6.7‚ÄùD x 8.35‚ÄùW x 8.67‚ÄùH, it slips onto my kitchen counter snugly, even in tight spaces cluttered with other appliances. The stainless steel body not only looks premium but also wipes clean with ridiculous ease, which is great for someone like me who spills coffee grounds precisely 100% of the time.  

I was particularly impressed by the built-in stand that adjusts seamlessly for different cup sizes. From 8oz cups to my trusty 14oz travel mug, everything fit without hassle. It‚Äôs a massive win for anyone who ditches bulky machines for something that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice function. Oh, and did I mention the satisfaction from using the reusable mesh filter that doubles as a scoop? Game-changer.  

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  

This machine is fast; I‚Äôm talking under three minutes fast, regardless of whether I brewed regular or bold coffee. As someone who occasionally stumbles toward my coffee maker half-asleep, the automatic shutoff feature was surprisingly helpful. Just hit the button, wander off zombie-style, and not worry about whether I‚Äôve left it brewing eternally. Speaking of customizations, the bold/regular strength selector was a revelation ‚Äì I tested both modes, and each delivered distinctly flavorful coffee. If you‚Äôre particular about your coffee strength, this feature hits the sweet spot.

**Advantages**  

- Eco-friendly reusable mesh filter eliminates single-use pods  
- Compact, stylish stainless steel design fits tight spaces  
- Adjustable stand accommodates various mug sizes  
- Quick brew time saves precious morning minutes

**User Experience and Ease of Use**  

Simplicity defines the usability of this coffee maker. I didn‚Äôt feel swamped by confusing settings. Fill the water, scoop coffee grounds directly using the built-in filter, and press a button. Unlike bigger restaurant-style machines or fiddly kettles, the intuitive design ensures that even my none-too-tech-savvy friend figured it out reasonably fast. It‚Äôs worth noting, due to the smaller tank capacity, frequent refills are unavoidable if you‚Äôre making several cups back-to-back. However, for single servings, this isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker‚Äîjust something to keep in mind.  

**Shortcomings**  

- Frequent refill needed for consistent usage  
- No programmable features like delayed brew  

**Other Options**  

While testing, I compared it with some popular alternatives like the Keurig K-Mini and Black+Decker Single-Serve Coffee Maker. The Keurig, although famous for pod-based convenience, doesn‚Äôt offer the same eco-friendliness as this machine. On the other hand, Black+Decker felt slightly clunkier in setup though, to its credit, it had a marginally larger water reservoir. Where Hamilton Beach clearly outperformed was brewing speed and the inclusion of a reusable filter‚Äîarguably two of the primary things any coffee drinker prioritizes daily.  

**Smart Spending**  

For its feature set, this coffee maker feels like a thoughtful investment. Rather than shell out additional dollars on wasteful pods or paper filters, the reusable scoop saves your wallet in the long run while helping the planet‚Äîyou basically pay for itself. Whether you appreciate the compact size or depend on its quick brewing ability during chaotic mornings, it proves itself thoroughly worth every penny.

So, you finally did it. You left behind the suburban sprawl, HOA rules, and $6 drip coffee in the States and landed in your own Eat, Pray, Love chapter.

Except now you‚Äôre in Bali or Barcelona or Bangkok, and you realize one tiny bureaucratic nightmare has followed you across the ocean like a clingy ex: your mail.

Yep. Good old-fashioned envelopes stuffed with IRS threats, bank statements, and mystery packages from Amazon you drunkenly ordered two months ago.

Because while your soul may be free and your passport full of stamps, the U.S. Postal Service still thinks you‚Äôre on Maple Street in Ohio‚Äîand it's going to keep sending you crap until you figure out how to deal with it.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about keeping your mail situation under control without it turning into a Kafkaesque spiral of lost documents and missed jury duty summons.

# Step One: Accept That the Mail System Wasn‚Äôt Built for Expats

Let‚Äôs be real: The postal system is still designed for people who live in one place. Preferably with a white picket fence and a dog named Max. If you‚Äôre country-hopping every three months and haven‚Äôt had a permanent address since pre-pandemic times, you‚Äôre gonna need a workaround.

The good news? You‚Äôve got options. The bad news? Most of them suck unless you do some planning.

# Option 1: Bribe a Friend (or Your Mom)

The old-school solution is to just reroute your mail to someone you trust back home. Your mom, your best friend, your ex that‚Äôs still oddly supportive‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt really matter, as long as they‚Äôre responsible and don‚Äôt throw out envelopes labeled ‚ÄúIMPORTANT TAX DOCUMENT.‚Äù

You can set this up with the USPS fairly easily. Just go online, fill in the address, and boom‚Äîyour physical life now lives in someone else‚Äôs hands.

**The catch:** Unless your friend is weirdly into sorting other people‚Äôs mail, there‚Äôs a strong chance they‚Äôll forget, ghost you, or toss what they *think* is junk mail that was actually a court summons. Also, mailbox theft is a thing, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîmost people don‚Äôt have Fort Knox-level security on their front porch.

# Option 2: Forward It All Abroad (AKA Light Your Wallet on Fire)

If you‚Äôve got cash to burn and an address abroad, USPS will technically forward your mail internationally. It‚Äôll cost you. It‚Äôll be slow. It‚Äôll still get lost sometimes. But if you just *have* to get your Bed Bath & Beyond coupons in the jungles of Costa Rica, this is the way.

Also, heads up: USPS forwarding only lasts 18 months. After that, it‚Äôs back to square one. Or square...zero?

# Option 3: Stop It All Cold Turkey

You can halt your mail for up to 30 days if you‚Äôre dipping out of the country for just a bit. Great if you‚Äôre testing the expat waters and want to delay the panic.

Just log onto the USPS Hold Mail page, verify your ID, and you‚Äôll at least stop the onslaught. Temporarily. This is not a long-term fix‚Äîbut neither is dating a local surf instructor who says he‚Äôs ""between apartments.""

# Option 4: Go Digital, Baby

Honestly, you should‚Äôve already done this. Almost every bank, utility, and institution lets you switch to paperless statements. Do it before you leave.

But‚Äîand it‚Äôs a big but‚Äîsome crucial stuff still requires snail mail:

* **IRS letters** (they only do old-school threats, no DMs)
* **Debit/credit cards** (you‚Äôll need a physical address to get replacements)
* **Jury summons** (yes, even 8,000 miles away, you might still get called)
* **Passports and government IDs** (because of course)

So while going paperless cuts down on the flood, it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for an actual mailbox. Which brings us to...

# Option 5: Enter the Era of Virtual Mailboxes

This is where things get *actually good*. Services like [Traveling Mailbox](https://travelingmailbox.com/?ref=288) (don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre not trying to sell you anything‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt suck) give you a legit U.S. street address. Your mail gets sent there, they scan the outside (and the inside if you tell them to), and you manage it all online like the digitally-literate wanderer you are.

You can have them:

* Open and scan documents
* Forward packages to wherever you are
* Shred sensitive stuff
* Even deposit checks (yes, checks still exist)

It‚Äôs kind of like having a personal mail assistant who doesn‚Äôt ask you why you‚Äôre dodging the IRS or what‚Äôs in the suspiciously thick envelope from that one subscription box you forgot to cancel.

It‚Äôs not free, obviously‚Äîbut compared to missed tax deadlines and forgotten student loan paperwork, it‚Äôs a damn bargain.

# What to Look for in a Mail Forwarding Service (So You Don‚Äôt Get Scammed)

If you‚Äôre shopping around for a service, ask yourself:

* **Is it secure?** Do they shred, encrypt, and guard your info like it's the nuclear codes?
* **Is it easy to use?** Can you manage everything online without needing to call a bored customer rep in the middle of your Wi-Fi blackout?
* **Is the pricing transparent?** No sneaky fees for scanning your own letter from grandma?
* **Do they forward packages globally?** Some don‚Äôt. Some do. Some charge more than your flight.
* **Is the address a real one?** You want an actual street address‚Äînot a sketchy P.O. box in the back of a vape shop.

[Traveling Mailbox](https://travelingmailbox.com/?ref=288), for example, ticks most of those boxes and has been around since 2011, so they‚Äôre not just gonna disappear with your W-2 forms. Again, not sponsored, just... not terrible.

# Final Thought: Your Freedom Doesn‚Äôt Mean Your Mail Disappears

Living abroad is sexy on Instagram but messy in real life. Your mail may seem like a small problem‚Äîbut in reality, it connects you to everything from your financial survival to your legal obligations. Don‚Äôt let that chaos snowball because you ‚Äúmeant to deal with it later.‚Äù

You already got out. You already took the leap. Don‚Äôt let a couple of missed letters be the thing that screws it up.

Now go live your expat dream. Just check your inbox (both of them) every once in a while.

**TL;DR for the Chronically Distracted**

* Forwarding your mail to your mom is fine... until it‚Äôs not.
* USPS international forwarding is expensive and temporary.
* Stopping mail is a short-term fix, not a lifestyle.
* Paperless is great but not foolproof‚Äîsome stuff still comes on dead trees.
* Virtual mailboxes like Traveling Mailbox are probably your best bet.
* Take mail seriously. It doesn‚Äôt care how far away you are.

Go forth, expat. Just don‚Äôt ghost your mailbox.",1,1754658333.0,DeliveryWoes,0,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I am dealing with a major case of ‚ÄúHyper Heidi-ism.‚Äù All of the Jammy girls are coming up next weekend and Professor Kurtz has arranged for them all to have auditions a week from Monday!

Once she‚Äôs inside of the cycle, it‚Äôs impossible for her to step outside of it. Susan, where are you when we need you?

Last night we home visited Lori and her parents. They live in a very small RV but I can‚Äôt imagine a happier family. Their living conditions approximate the space allotted to a family in the Haudenosaunee longhouse. It‚Äôs tiny but every square inch has purpose. And then there‚Äôs the outdoors right outside! And here is Pippi Longstocking conquering her world. Now, how do we capture that in Longhouse Elem?

>The life of our School of Joy was not cramped by strict regulations. It was not stipulated how much time the children should spend under the open sky. The main thing was that the children should not tire of it, that they should never long for the teacher to tell them it was time to go home. I tried to end our lessons when the children showed heightened interest in what we were observing or doing. I wanted the little ones to look forward to the next day with anticipation of new joys. I wanted them to see the sun scattering silver sparks in their dreams. One day the children might spend an hour or an hour and a half, the next day four hours. It all depended on how much joy the teacher was able to bring the children on that day. It was also very important that each child not only experienced joy, but also created it, making their own little contribution to the life of the class (p. 43). 

Sometimes I feel that my partners are not listening to me or Uncle Vasyl. But we reached a compromise. At least an hour a day will be unstructured time outdoors and for telling stories. If this works out, we can expand it to more time. It‚Äôs a start. And it will be my responsibility to be the outdoors educator.

We do have a great idea for ‚ÄúCommunity Studies.‚Äù The local health department inspected the new kitchen and it passed. Dee is all licensed up. Starting on the first day, we are going to tour every inch of the kitchen and Dee is going to start teaching them to be ‚Äújunior sous chefs.‚Äù

1mkuo4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1mkuo4o/this_accessible_fjord_adventure_is_nextlevel/,This Accessible Fjord Adventure is Next-Level,"There‚Äôs a melody in accessible travel. Gently ramped docks, elevators whispering into galleries, and train seats with priority tags like reserved altars to dignity and design. In Oslo, the city has scrubbed itself into the future, making museums and public transit truly inclusive, a pavement symphony for mobility aids that opens up culture with the ease of pouring aquavit.

Tourism exploded in 2024. Norway recorded a record-shattering 38.6 million overnight stays, climbing 4.2 percent over the previous year and sending foreign overnight stays skyward to 12.4 million, up 12 percent, according to Statistics Norway via Wataha News. Tourist spending hit $7.8 billion, a 30 percent leap from 2023, as reported by RoadGenius. The travel sector is pushing nearly 500 billion Norwegian kroner into Norway‚Äôs GDP and fueling thousands of jobs, Statista notes.

The pulse of it all here is not just quantity but quality. Imagine stepping from your accessible van onto a dock where a wheelchair ramp glides into a fjord cruise vessel. Elevators glide you into public galleries. The Fl√•m Railway hands you a priority seat as the rails wind through hairpin turns that feel like cinematic breaths of mountain air. These aren‚Äôt bullet points, they are polished sentences in the story of inclusion.

A day in Oslo delivers coffee strong enough to jolt a moose, pastries dusted with cardamom that sing of centuries. Walkable streets, ferry runs across glass-grey waters, and museums full of viking longship bones and modern art brilliance. An average visitor spends $125 to $130 per day on food, lodging, transit, and sightlines, putting the weeklong costs near $888, says RoadGenius. Accessible doesn‚Äôt mean sterile. Caf√©s offer oat lattes, cured salmon on rye, open-flame grilled cheese. Flavors that warm your teeth.

Then the fjords open. The world leans back as accessible cruise vessels arc into valleys carved by time, accordioning between vertical cliffs, waterfalls dangling like liquid threads from icy heights. A cruise ticket might run $200 to $300 for a day. You sip gl√∏gg or local craft beer on deck accessible by elevator, feel brine whip your cheeks, and watch seals and eagles pose just for you.

Food-pop infusions happen at every stop. Quayside lunches where fish soup tastes like essence of sea and bone, brown cheese on crispbread that flips your tongue inside out. Backpackers on Reddit swear Norway‚Äôs simple fares punch above expectations. Ramen bowls or flatbread under local prices, train cafes offering cod plates for under 300 NOK, supermarket meals for 100 NOK. It‚Äôs approachable adventure with a price tag you remember without wincing.

The best season to chase light and access is May through August, when midnight sun drapes the land in gold and trails are dry. That‚Äôs when museums hum and fjord gasps open wide to warm days. Wind and weather lean soft, perfect for wheelchairs, walkers, or anyone who expects Earth to be a stage dressed in green, not a gauntlet.

This is a country that knows how to say yes. Yes to tourists and to those who require calm ramps and priority seats. Yes to flavor that‚Äôs both rustic and refined. Yes to wild scenery that doesn‚Äôt ask you to climb, only to lean in and taste what patience has sculpted over eons of cold and tide.

This tour through Oslo into the fjords isn‚Äôt just accessible, it‚Äôs alive. It is proof that narrative, cuisine, and terrain can all bend kindly toward inclusion while still demanding awe.

Yeah, I've been there too. That's when I stumbled across the¬†**Lifepro Waver**¬†and its incredible lymphatic drainage exercises. Trust me, this isn't another fitness fad that promises the world and delivers a paper airplane‚Äîthis machine actually works, and I'm here to spill all the tea on why it might just be the game-changer you've been looking for.

# What's the Deal with Lymphatic Drainage Anyway?

Let me break this down for you without getting all medical textbook-y on you. Your¬†**lymphatic system**¬†is basically your body's cleanup crew. Think of it as the sanitation department that hauls away cellular waste, toxins, and excess fluid that your tissues don't need hanging around. When this system gets sluggish (which happens more often than we'd like), you end up feeling bloated, tired, and generally blah.

The Lifepro Waver uses¬†**whole-body vibration therapy**¬†to give your lymphatic system the gentle kick in the pants it needs. The vibrations create a pumping action that helps move lymph fluid throughout your body, essentially turbocharging your natural detox process.

Here's what happens when you hop on this bad boy:

* Muscle contractions increase lymph flow
* Blood circulation gets a major boost
* Your body starts flushing out toxins more efficiently
* Swelling and inflammation can decrease

Pretty neat, right? But here's where it gets interesting‚Äîyou don't just stand there like a statue. There are specific exercises that maximize these benefits.

# The Science Behind Vibration Plate Magic

Ever wonder why this whole vibration thing actually works? Well, buckle up because the science is pretty cool. When you stand on the Lifepro Waver, it sends¬†**controlled vibrations**¬†through your body at frequencies typically ranging from 15-50Hz. These vibrations force your muscles to contract and relax dozens of times per second.

Your lymphatic vessels have tiny muscles in their walls called¬†**smooth muscles**. When these get stimulated by vibration, they contract more efficiently, pushing lymph fluid along its journey back to your bloodstream. It's like giving your internal plumbing system a really good flush üòÉ

The¬†**acceleration forces**¬†created by the vibration plate also help squeeze interstitial fluid (that's the stuff hanging out between your cells) back into circulation. Think of it as wringing out a sponge‚Äîexcept the sponge is your entire body, and you're doing it from the inside out.

# Essential Lymphatic Drainage Exercises on the Lifepro Waver

# Basic Standing Position

Let's start simple because nobody likes to feel overwhelmed on day one. The¬†**basic standing position**¬†is your foundation, and honestly, it's more effective than you might think.

**How to do it:**

* Stand with feet hip-width apart
* Keep your knees slightly bent (don't lock them‚Äîyour joints will thank you later)
* Engage your core gently
* Let your arms hang naturally at your sides
* Start with 30-60 seconds

The beauty of this position is that it targets your¬†**lower body lymph nodes**‚Äîparticularly those in your groin and behind your knees. IMO, this should be everyone's starting point because it's practically foolproof.

# Upper Body Pump

Now we're getting somewhere! This exercise specifically targets the lymph nodes in your armpits and chest area, which can get pretty congested if you spend most of your day hunched over a computer (guilty as charged).

**The technique:**

* Stand in basic position on the Waver
* Raise your arms to shoulder height
* Make gentle pumping motions with your arms
* Alternate lifting your arms up and down
* Continue for 1-2 minutes

I like to think of this as conducting an invisible orchestra, except the music you're making is actually your lymph system getting its groove back. The¬†**rhythmic arm movements**¬†combined with the vibrations create a double whammy effect that really gets things moving.

# Calf Raises for Lower Limb Drainage

Your calves are like the heart of your lower body's circulatory system. When you do calf raises on the Lifepro Waver, you're essentially creating a¬†**muscle pump**¬†that helps push lymph and blood back up toward your heart.

**Here's the play:**

* Stand on the vibration plate
* Rise up onto your toes
* Hold for 2-3 seconds
* Lower back down slowly
* Repeat 15-20 times

The vibrations amplify the pumping action of your calf muscles, making this exercise way more effective than doing regular calf raises on solid ground. Plus, it feels pretty awesome‚Äîlike getting a massage while working out.

[**Buy the Lifepro Waver Vibration Plate on Amazon**](https://amzn.to/4m7etba)

# Side Steps for Hip and Thigh Drainage

This one targets the¬†**lymph nodes in your groin area**, which can get really backed up, especially if you sit a lot. Side steps on the Waver help create movement in these crucial drainage points.

**The movement:**

* Start in basic standing position
* Step to one side while staying on the plate
* Bring the other foot to meet it
* Step to the other side
* Keep the movement controlled and rhythmic
* Continue for 2-3 minutes

The lateral movement combined with the vibrations helps squeeze lymph through the vessels in your inner thighs and hip area. It's like giving your lower body plumbing a really thorough cleaning.

# Gentle Squats for Maximum Impact

Okay, before you roll your eyes and think ""great, more squats,"" hear me out.¬†**Squats on the Lifepro Waver**¬†are a completely different beast from regular squats. The vibrations make every muscle fiber work harder while also providing that lymphatic pumping action we're after.

**Proper form:**

* Feet shoulder-width apart on the plate
* Lower down as if sitting in an invisible chair
* Keep your chest up and core engaged
* Don't go too deep‚Äîshallow squats work just fine
* Hold for 3-5 seconds, then rise up
* Repeat 10-15 times

The¬†**quadriceps contractions**¬†during squats help squeeze lymph vessels in your thighs, while the vibrations ensure your entire lower body gets involved in the drainage party.

# Advanced Techniques for Lymphatic Optimization

# The Bounce and Shake Method

Once you've mastered the basics, it's time to level up. The bounce and shake method is exactly what it sounds like, and yes, you might look a little silly‚Äîbut who cares when you feel this good afterward?

**The technique:**

* Start in basic standing position
* Add gentle bouncing movements
* Let your whole body be loose and relaxed
* Shake your hands and arms gently
* Continue for 2-3 minutes

This approach helps create¬†**mechanical lymphatic drainage**¬†throughout your entire body. The combination of vibrations and intentional movement creates a full-body flush that's particularly effective for people dealing with chronic inflammation or fluid retention.

# Targeted Lymph Node Activation

Different positions on the Lifepro Waver can target specific lymph node clusters. Here's where you can get strategic about your approach:

**For neck and head drainage:**

* Stand and gently roll your shoulders
* Add slow head movements (be careful here!)
* Focus on relaxing your jaw and facial muscles

**For arm and chest drainage:**

* Swing your arms gently while standing
* Cross your arms over your chest and uncross rhythmically
* Make circular motions with your shoulders

**For abdominal drainage:**

* Place hands on your lower ribs
* Breathe deeply while the vibrations work
* Add gentle twisting movements from your waist

# Getting the Most Out of Your Sessions

# Timing is Everything

When should you hop on the Lifepro Waver for maximum lymphatic benefits? I've found that¬†**timing really does matter**. Here's what works best in my experience:

**Morning sessions**¬†(5-10 minutes) help kickstart your lymphatic system for the day. It's like hitting the reset button on your body's drainage system before you even have your coffee.

**Evening sessions**¬†(10-15 minutes) can help your body process the day's accumulated toxins and reduce any swelling that's built up. Plus, many people find it relaxing before bed.

**Post-workout sessions**¬†are golden. When you've been moving and sweating, your lymphatic system is already active. The Waver helps finish the job and can reduce post-exercise soreness.

# Frequency and Duration Sweet Spots

You don't need to go crazy here.¬†**Quality over quantity**¬†is the name of the game. I recommend:

* **Beginners:**¬†5-10 minutes, 3-4 times per week
* **Intermediate:**¬†10-15 minutes, 4-5 times per week
* **Advanced:**¬†15-20 minutes, daily (with rest days as needed)

Your body will tell you if you're overdoing it. Start conservative and build up gradually. The vibrations are more intense than they might initially seem!

# Hydration is Non-Negotiable

Here's something people often overlook:¬†**you need to drink water**¬†before and after using the Lifepro Waver. Think about it‚Äîyou're essentially helping your body flush out toxins and waste products. If you're not properly hydrated, you're just moving sludge around instead of actually clearing it out.

I aim for at least 16-20 ounces of water about 30 minutes before my session, and another 16-20 ounces afterward. Trust me, your kidneys will thank you for this.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# Going Too Hard, Too Fast

I get it‚Äîyou want results yesterday. But¬†**starting with high intensity vibrations**¬†and long sessions is a recipe for feeling pretty crappy. Your lymphatic system needs time to adapt to the increased workload.

Start with lower vibration settings and shorter sessions. You can always increase intensity as your body adjusts. There's no prize for making yourself miserable on day one.

# Ignoring Your Body's Signals

Pay attention to how you feel during and after sessions. Some¬†**mild fatigue or increased urination**¬†is normal as your body processes and eliminates toxins. But if you feel dizzy, nauseous, or unusually exhausted, dial it back.

# Skipping the Warm-Up

Even though the Lifepro Waver provides vibration, your body still benefits from a gentle warm-up.¬†**Light stretching or walking**¬†for 2-3 minutes before stepping on the plate helps prepare your muscles and joints for the vibrations.

# The Real-World Benefits You Can Expect

After using lymphatic drainage exercises on the Lifepro Waver consistently, here's what you might notice:

**Within the first week:**

* Reduced bloating and feeling less ""puffy""
* Improved energy levels
* Better sleep quality

**After 2-4 weeks:**

* Noticeable reduction in cellulite appearance
* Less muscle soreness after workouts
* Improved circulation (warmer hands and feet)

**Long-term benefits:**

* Enhanced immune function
* Better skin tone and texture
* Reduced inflammation throughout the body
* Improved recovery from illness or injury

FYI, everyone's timeline is different, so don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Your lymphatic system has probably been sluggish for a while‚Äîgive it time to remember how to work efficiently again.

# Making It Part of Your Routine

The key to success with the Lifepro Waver is¬†**consistency over perfection**. I'd rather see you use it for 5 minutes every other day than go all-out for an hour once a week and then forget about it for a month.

Consider pairing your lymphatic drainage sessions with other healthy habits:

* Do it while watching your morning news
* Use it as a transition between work and relaxation time
* Make it part of your pre-workout routine
* Combine it with meditation or deep breathing

The goal is to make it feel like a natural part of your day rather than another item on your to-do list that you'll eventually start avoiding.

# Wrapping This Up

Look, I'm not going to pretend the Lifepro Waver is some miracle cure-all that'll solve every health issue you've ever had. But when it comes to¬†**supporting your lymphatic system**¬†and helping your body's natural detox processes work more efficiently? This thing really delivers.

The lymphatic drainage exercises I've outlined here aren't complicated or time-consuming, but they can make a real difference in how you feel day-to-day. Whether you're dealing with chronic inflammation, feeling sluggish, or just want to support your body's natural healing processes, these techniques are worth incorporating into your routine.

Remember, your lymphatic system has been working 24/7 to keep you healthy‚Äîmaybe it's time to return the favor and give it some well-deserved support. Your body will definitely thank you for it, and honestly, you might just find yourself wondering why you waited so long to try this approach. Now get out there and give your lymphatic system the boost it's been waiting for!",1,1754657962.0,Fitnessplates,0,1.0,False

The salted caramel cr√®me cold brew has been my daily go to for years. Every morning on my way to work, I‚Äôd stop and order the same thing.

But over the past few months, I‚Äôve noticed a change. The cold foam is much thinner, and by the time my drink is handed to me, it‚Äôs already dissolved into the cold brew. At first, I thought maybe it was just an issue at my usual location, maybe a new barista learning the ropes.

Then I tried a Starbucks across town. Same thing. A week later, I stopped at another store nearly 30 miles away. Same thing again. Unless the same barista is magically working at all three locations for months on end, something has clearly changed in the process.

Is the cold foam being thinned out to cut costs? Today was my final straw.. or rather, my final cold brew. I watched them make it, and before it even reached my hands, it looked more like a latte than a cold brew with cold foam. When I mentioned it didn‚Äôt seem right, I was told, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been like that.‚Äù

It hasn‚Äôt. üò©

By combining key amino acids, vitamins, and plant-based extracts, it aims to address fundamental male-function concerns in an easy-to-follow routine. For those seeking elevated stamina and energy without sacrificing convenience, Nitric Boost could serve as a meaningful, practical addition to daily life.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

Spurred on by Jack‚Äôs improvements, a small group of testers began sampling the same formula‚Äîeventually named Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äîto determine if it could address their own concerns about wellness and connection. Many participants observed positive outcomes in daily energy, endurance, and general well-being, all while bypassing more aggressive or artificial interventions.

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**







Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate* In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine* Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder* Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)* Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder* Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3* Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.  

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy**:**¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection**:**¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.
* Flexibility**:**¬†Nitric Boost does not require significant changes in diet or exercise, allowing individuals to add it to their lifestyle with minimal disruption.  

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost**.**¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements**:**¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets**:**¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.  

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.  

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.  

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels**:**¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.  

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†[**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website,**,](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net)¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

*Potential Bundles*

1. **Starter Package**¬†‚Äì A single container for those who want to test the product for about a month.
2. **Value Package**¬†‚Äì Three containers, typically offered at a reduced per-container cost.
3. **Best Value Package**¬†‚Äì Six containers intended for consistent, long-term use (up to six months). Many who leave Nitric Boost reviews mention more pronounced results after several weeks of ongoing supplementation.  

Nitric Boost coupon codes or seasonal Nitric Boost promo deals may be launched at different times of the year. Checking the official site allows consumers to see up-to-date discounts, possible free shipping, and occasional bonus materials such as e-books or supplemental guides.

*Nitric Boost Secure Online Ordering*

* **Official Nitric Boost Website**: Ensures authentic product quality, safe transactions, and real-time pricing updates.
* **Money-Back Guarantee**: The brand often provides a 180-day refund window, offering a risk-free opportunity to evaluate Nitric Boost.
* **Customer Support**: Dedicated email or phone assistance remains available for inquiries on usage, shipping, or product details.  

**Nitric Boost vs. Other Methods: Why Natural Support May Matter**

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.  

By¬†[**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net), users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.  

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.  

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

Nitric Boost Official Support: A designated customer service channel can assist with returns, order tracking, or basic product questions. Refund windows (often up to 180 days) let people evaluate how well Nitric Boost fits into their lifestyle.

*Steps to Secure Nitric Boost Online*

1. Visit the¬†[**Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net).
2. Choose from single, three-container, or six-container packages.
3. Complete a secure checkout via credit card or other payment method.
4. Track shipment updates via email or the brand‚Äôs official contact page.

**Nitric Boost: Clearing Misunderstandings About Side Effects**

Given its natural, non-habit-forming ingredients, Nitric Boost side effects are reportedly minimal. Still, everyone‚Äôs body is different, and mild digestive adjustments might occur as the system adapts to new nutrients.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.  

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

Spurred on by Jack‚Äôs improvements, a small group of testers began sampling the same formula‚Äîeventually named Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äîto determine if it could address their own concerns about wellness and connection. Many participants observed positive outcomes in daily energy, endurance, and general well-being, all while bypassing more aggressive or artificial interventions.

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**

Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate*¬†In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine*¬†Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder*¬†Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)*¬†Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder*¬†Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3*¬†Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy\*\*:\*\*¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection\*\*:\*\*¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost\*\*.\*\*¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements\*\*:\*\*¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets\*\*:\*\*¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels\*\*:\*\*¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website**,¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

*Potential Bundles*

1. **Starter Package**¬†‚Äì A single container for those who want to test the product for about a month.
2. **Value Package**¬†‚Äì Three containers, typically offered at a reduced per-container cost.
3. **Best Value Package**¬†‚Äì Six containers intended for consistent, long-term use (up to six months). Many who leave Nitric Boost reviews mention more pronounced results after several weeks of ongoing supplementation.

Nitric Boost coupon codes or seasonal Nitric Boost promo deals may be launched at different times of the year. Checking the official site allows consumers to see up-to-date discounts, possible free shipping, and occasional bonus materials such as e-books or supplemental guides.

*Nitric Boost Secure Online Ordering*

* **Official Nitric Boost Website**: Ensures authentic product quality, safe transactions, and real-time pricing updates.
* **Money-Back Guarantee**: The brand often provides a 180-day refund window, offering a risk-free opportunity to evaluate Nitric Boost.
* **Customer Support**: Dedicated email or phone assistance remains available for inquiries on usage, shipping, or product details.

**Nitric Boost vs. Other Methods: Why Natural Support May Matter**

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.

By¬†**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**, users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

Nitric Boost Official Support: A designated customer service channel can assist with returns, order tracking, or basic product questions. Refund windows (often up to 180 days) let people evaluate how well Nitric Boost fits into their lifestyle.

3. Complete a secure checkout via credit card or other payment method.
4. Track shipment updates via email or the brand‚Äôs official contact page.

**Nitric Boost: Clearing Misunderstandings About Side Effects**

Given its natural, non-habit-forming ingredients, Nitric Boost side effects are reportedly minimal. Still, everyone‚Äôs body is different, and mild digestive adjustments might occur as the system adapts to new nutrients.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website**,¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**

Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate*¬†In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine*¬†Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder*¬†Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)*¬†Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder*¬†Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3*¬†Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy\*\*:\*\*¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection\*\*:\*\*¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.
* Flexibility\*\*:\*\*¬†Nitric Boost does not require significant changes in diet or exercise, allowing individuals to add it to their lifestyle with minimal disruption.

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost\*\*.\*\*¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements\*\*:\*\*¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets\*\*:\*\*¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels\*\*:\*\*¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

Spurred on by Jack‚Äôs improvements, a small group of testers began sampling the same formula‚Äîeventually named Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äîto determine if it could address their own concerns about wellness and connection.

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**

Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate*¬†In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine*¬†Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder*¬†Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)*¬†Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder*¬†Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3*¬†Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

For those looking to optimize circulation, endurance, and daily vitality, Nitric Boost offers a scientifically backed solution\*\*.\*\*¬†Learn more about its powerful blend of ingredients and how it can elevate your performance.

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy\*\*:\*\*¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection\*\*:\*\*¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.
* Flexibility\*\*:\*\*¬†Nitric Boost does not require significant changes in diet or exercise, allowing individuals to add it to their lifestyle with minimal disruption.

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost\*\*.\*\*¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements\*\*:\*\*¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets\*\*:\*\*¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels\*\*:\*\*¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website**,¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

*Potential Bundles*

1. **Starter Package**¬†‚Äì A single container for those who want to test the product for about a month.
2. **Value Package**¬†‚Äì Three containers, typically offered at a reduced per-container cost.
3. **Best Value Package**¬†‚Äì Six containers intended for consistent, long-term use (up to six months). Many who leave Nitric Boost reviews mention more pronounced results after several weeks of ongoing supplementation.

Nitric Boost coupon codes or seasonal Nitric Boost promo deals may be launched at different times of the year. Checking the official site allows consumers to see up-to-date discounts, possible free shipping, and occasional bonus materials such as e-books or supplemental guides.

*Nitric Boost Secure Online Ordering*

* **Official Nitric Boost Website**: Ensures authentic product quality, safe transactions, and real-time pricing updates.
* **Money-Back Guarantee**: The brand often provides a 180-day refund window, offering a risk-free opportunity to evaluate Nitric Boost.
* **Customer Support**: Dedicated email or phone assistance remains available for inquiries on usage, shipping, or product details.

**Nitric Boost vs. Other Methods: Why Natural Support May Matter**

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.

By¬†**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**, users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

Nitric Boost Official Support: A designated customer service channel can assist with returns, order tracking, or basic product questions. Refund windows (often up to 180 days) let people evaluate how well Nitric Boost fits into their lifestyle.

*Steps to Secure Nitric Boost Online*

3. Complete a secure checkout via credit card or other payment method.
4. Track shipment updates via email or the brand‚Äôs official contact page.

**Nitric Boost: Clearing Misunderstandings About Side Effects**

Given its natural, non-habit-forming ingredients, Nitric Boost side effects are reportedly minimal. Still, everyone‚Äôs body is different, and mild digestive adjustments might occur as the system adapts to new nutrients.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost**.**¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements**:**¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets**:**¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.  

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.  

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.  

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels**:**¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.  

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†[**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website,**,](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net)¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

2. **Value Package**¬†‚Äì Three containers, typically offered at a reduced per-container cost.

* **Customer Support**: Dedicated email or phone assistance remains available for inquiries on usage, shipping, or product details.  

**Nitric Boost vs. Other Methods: Why Natural Support May Matter**

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.  

By¬†[**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net), users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.  

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.  

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

Nitric Boost Official Support: A designated customer service channel can assist with returns, order tracking, or basic product questions. Refund windows (often up to 180 days) let people evaluate how well Nitric Boost fits into their lifestyle.

*Steps to Secure Nitric Boost Online*

1. Visit the¬†[**Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net).
2. Choose from single, three-container, or six-container packages.
3. Complete a secure checkout via credit card or other payment method.
4. Track shipment updates via email or the brand‚Äôs official contact page.

**Nitric Boost: Clearing Misunderstandings About Side Effects**

Given its natural, non-habit-forming ingredients, Nitric Boost side effects are reportedly minimal. Still, everyone‚Äôs body is different, and mild digestive adjustments might occur as the system adapts to new nutrients.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.  

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**







Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate* In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine* Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder* Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)* Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder* Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3* Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.  

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.  

By¬†[**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net), users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.  

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.  

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.  

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

Inspired by the real-life story of ‚ÄúJack,‚Äù a committed paramedic who regained his daily energy using a simple, natural method, Nitric Boost strives to broaden access to these benefits. Beyond physical improvements, it emphasizes emotional well-being, stronger connections, and renewed self-assurance.

For those seeking elevated stamina and energy without sacrificing convenience, Nitric Boost could serve as a meaningful, practical addition to daily life.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

Spurred on by Jack‚Äôs improvements, a small group of testers began sampling the same formula‚Äîeventually named Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äîto determine if it could address their own concerns about wellness and connection. Many participants observed positive outcomes in daily energy, endurance, and general well-being, all while bypassing more aggressive or artificial interventions.

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**







Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate* In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine* Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder* Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)* Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder* Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3* Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.  

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy**:**¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection**:**¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.
* Flexibility**:**¬†Nitric Boost does not require significant changes in diet or exercise, allowing individuals to add it to their lifestyle with minimal disruption.  

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost**.**¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements**:**¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets**:**¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.  

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.  

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.  

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels**:**¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.  

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies.

Nitric Boost Ultra sets itself apart from the glut of rapid-fix products by embracing a more holistic philosophy: harnessing clinically studied botanical ingredients that may elevate nitric oxide levels and support healthy blood flow. Inspired by the real-life story of ‚ÄúJack,‚Äù a committed paramedic who regained his daily energy using a simple, natural method, Nitric Boost strives to broaden access to these benefits. Beyond physical improvements, it emphasizes emotional well-being, stronger connections, and renewed self-assurance. With many individuals facing fatigue, stress, and diminishing vitality, Nitric Boost offers a straightforward yet comprehensive avenue for boosting overall health.

Nitric Boost is explored in greater detail throughout this press release, covering its ingredient science, user feedback, and how to buy Nitric Boost at special discounts. By combining key amino acids, vitamins, and plant-based extracts, it aims to address fundamental male-function concerns in an easy-to-follow routine. For those seeking elevated stamina and energy without sacrificing convenience, Nitric Boost could serve as a meaningful, practical addition to daily life.

**Nitric Boost: The 7-Second Approach That Aims to Elevate Daily Energy**

Nitric Boost stands out in the wellness space with its deceptively simple ‚Äú7-second morning remedy.‚Äù While many male health solutions rely on intrusive procedures, pricey equipment, or uncomfortable routines, Nitric Boost Ultra takes a gentler approach. Users stir a single scoop of its signature ‚Äúpurple tonic‚Äù into water or juice once daily, aiming to support energy and vitality without the burden of complex interventions.

*Jack‚Äôs Motivating Journey*

The story behind Nitric Boost begins with Jack, a paramedic dealing with low energy, diminished motivation, and eroding self-confidence. Rather than turning to high-risk measures, Jack consulted a friend knowledgeable in biomedical science. Through carefully formulating botanical extracts, amino acids, and vitamins, they created a purple beverage consumed each day‚Äîa drink that Jack credits with restoring his vitality, physical strength, and emotional closeness with loved ones.

*The Early Rise of Nitric Boost*

Spurred on by Jack‚Äôs improvements, a small group of testers began sampling the same formula‚Äîeventually named Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äîto determine if it could address their own concerns about wellness and connection. Many participants observed positive outcomes in daily energy, endurance, and general well-being, all while bypassing more aggressive or artificial interventions.

**Nitric Boost Supplement Facts and Proprietary Insights**







Nitric Boost emphasizes transparency by showcasing a carefully curated blend of ingredients recognized for supporting nitric oxide production, healthy blood flow, and total wellness. Although the precise dosage remains proprietary to protect Nitric Boost Ultra‚Äôs uniqueness, each component is chosen for its specific contribution to circulation, stamina, and daily vitality.

* *L-Citrulline DL-Malate* In Nitric Boost, L-Citrulline DL-Malate is included for its widely studied role in promoting nitric oxide levels. By aiding the conversion of L-arginine in the body, this amino acid may help optimize circulation, energy output, and exercise performance.
* *L-Arginine* Another cornerstone of Nitric Boost, L-Arginine is an amino acid that can further boost nitric oxide production. It‚Äôs often associated with improved blood flow, making it a popular choice for those looking to sustain energy and physical endurance.
* *Beet Root Powder* Renowned for its natural nitrates, Beet Root Powder in Nitric Boost may help support cardiovascular health and endurance. Its high antioxidant content also contributes to overall wellness, potentially aiding in muscle recovery and oxygen utilization.
* *Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium)* Added to Nitric Boost for its tradition of supporting energy, drive, and male vitality, Horny Goat Weed contains icariin. This compound may act as a natural PDE5 inhibitor, helping blood vessels remain relaxed and promoting healthy circulation.
* *Ginkgo Biloba Powder* Ginkgo Biloba in Nitric Boost is valued for its potential to enhance circulation and mental clarity. Its antioxidant properties may further contribute to protecting cells from everyday stress and promoting a balanced mood.
* *Niacin (Vitamin B3*) Present in Nitric Boost to assist with energy metabolism, Niacin can help regulate cholesterol levels and promote healthy blood flow. It‚Äôs also linked to supporting the function of various enzymes involved in bodily processes.
* *Vitamin D3* Included in Nitric Boost for its wide range of health benefits, Vitamin D3 may positively influence immune function, bone density, and testosterone levels. By maintaining proper vitamin D status, individuals can support multiple aspects of well-being.  

By bringing together amino acids, vitamins, and plant extracts in a convenient powder form, Nitric Boost aims to address various factors that can lead to low energy and decreased performance. Quick absorption from mixing with water or another favorite beverage helps optimize each ingredient‚Äôs potential to activate nitric oxide pathways.

*Why Nitric Oxide Matters*

Nitric oxide is frequently referred to as the ‚Äúmanhood molecule‚Äù because of its key role in muscle function, blood circulation, and overall male vitality. In Nitric Boost, building blocks like L-citrulline and L-arginine supply the body with tools to support healthy nitric oxide levels. Additionally, the presence of icariin in Horny Goat Weed may naturally inhibit PDE5, an enzyme that can undermine nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits when left unchecked. This strategic combination helps ensure proper blood flow and supports a fundamental aspect of well-being for those seeking a boost in daily energy and stamina.

For those looking to optimize circulation, endurance, and daily vitality, Nitric Boost offers a scientifically backed solution**.**¬†Learn more about its powerful blend of ingredients and how it can elevate your performance‚Äî[**visit the official website here!**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net)

**Nitric Boost Ingredients and the Power of a Simple Daily Ritual**

Nitric Boost distinguishes itself by integrating seamlessly into a user‚Äôs routine. Often referred to as a ‚Äú7-second remedy,‚Äù this approach requires only a quick scoop, mix, and drink‚Äîno complicated steps or specialized equipment.

*Balancing Energy, Confidence, and Social Well-Being*

* Physical Energy**:**¬†By supporting healthy circulation, Nitric Boost may help enhance muscle performance and reduce day-to-day fatigue.
* Emotional Connection**:**¬†Many users report improved mood and confidence, suggesting that better physical wellness can foster deeper interactions with family, friends, or partners.
* Flexibility**:**¬†Nitric Boost does not require significant changes in diet or exercise, allowing individuals to add it to their lifestyle with minimal disruption.  

Numerous Nitric Boost reviews praise this straightforward routine for keeping them consistent, like taking a daily vitamin or sipping a cup of coffee each morning. According to the brand, this steady adherence allows the formula‚Äôs potential benefits to build and strengthen over time.

**Nitric Boost: ‚Äú7-Second Home Remedy‚Äù for a More Reliable Daily Boost**

Many products claim to solve male-function challenges or low motivation, but few are as simple and sustainable as Nitric Boost**.**¬†Jack‚Äôs personal story reveals how a gradual loss of energy, self-confidence, and emotional connection can creep up over time‚Äîand how a brief, daily routine can make a meaningful difference in overall well-being.

*Nitric Boost: A Simpler Alternative to Traditional Approaches*

Historically, people seeking male vitality have often turned to methods that come with substantial drawbacks:

* High-Stimulant Supplements**:**¬†Can trigger anxiety, restlessness, or energy crashes.
* Prescription Injections: Expensive, sometimes painful, and requiring frequent doctor visits.
* Restrictive Diets**:**¬†Hard to maintain and may not directly address nitric oxide production or blood flow.  

In contrast, the ‚Äú7-second home remedy‚Äù from Nitric Boost fits effortlessly into a busy schedule‚Äîmixed into water, juice, or a morning shake. According to both user feedback and brand information, it generally avoids harsh side effects linked to more aggressive solutions. By requiring minimal effort, Nitric Boost offers a practical path to enhanced energy, endurance, and confidence without unnecessary complications.

**Nitric Boost: Jack‚Äôs Renewed Sense of Confidence and Connection**

One of the most compelling stories tied to Nitric Boost involves Jack, a paramedic whose energy levels and overall enthusiasm for life were gradually slipping away. Despite trying standard advice‚Äîlike eating healthier or cutting back on alcohol‚ÄîJack found these measures alone weren‚Äôt enough. He needed a more targeted nutritional strategy to restore his vitality and rekindle his drive.

*The Breakthrough Moment*

After confiding in a biomedical engineer friend, Jack was introduced to a mix of amino acids, vitamins, and herbs aimed at bolstering nitric oxide levels. Upon sticking to this regimen for just two weeks, he noticed:

1. Greater stamina throughout his day (and night).
2. A more positive mood, fostering stronger connections and deeper conversations with loved ones.
3. Heightened self-confidence, which improved both his work interactions and personal goals.  

Word of Jack‚Äôs success soon spread to those around him, prompting a handful of individuals to test the same formula. Their encouraging results led to a more refined version, now known as Nitric Boost Ultra. Many early users echoed Jack‚Äôs reports‚Äîciting renewed physical performance, a better daily outlook, and a revitalized sense of well-being‚Äîhighlighting the potential that consistent nitric oxide support holds for boosting energy, resilience, and overall quality of life.

**Nitric Boost, Dr. Simon‚Äôs Research, and Underlying Science**

Nitric Boost gained a personal touch through Jack‚Äôs story, yet its broader credibility stems from well-established nutritional studies. The combination of L-citrulline, beet root powder, and various cofactors is based on documented research, rather than guesswork. Scientific findings indicate that:

* Beet root nitrates may help elevate nitric oxide levels, contributing to healthier circulation and improved endurance.
* Amino acids like L-citrulline and L-arginine are known precursors to nitric oxide, supporting cGMP‚Äîa molecule essential for robust blood flow.
* Natural PDE5 inhibitors (such as icariin in horny goat weed) can potentially amplify nitric oxide‚Äôs benefits.
* Vitamin D3 is linked to testosterone regulation, crucial for muscle health, mood, and overall male wellness.
* Niacin plays a role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and promoting better vasodilation.  

*Nitric Boost: Synergy That Extends Beyond a Quick Fix*

Single-ingredient supplements can provide a temporary energy boost, but often overlook the interplay between circulation, hormonal balance, and mental clarity. Nitric Boost seeks to unite these factors into a unified formula. By delivering multiple supportive nutrients in precisely measured ratios, it aims to encourage consistent stamina, emotional steadiness, and an overall smoother daily experience‚Äîrather than relying on short-lived fixes.

**Nitric Boost Results: Customers Share Quick Turnarounds and Sustained Energy**

Although formal, product-specific clinical trials remain unpublished, user experiences and existing ingredient data inform the brand‚Äôs confidence in Nitric Boost. Across numerous Nitric Boost reviews, several consistent themes emerge:

* A Notable Shift in Energy Levels**:**¬†Some men report reduced afternoon fatigue and less morning grogginess once they commit to the daily routine.
* Heightened Emotional Closeness: Improved mood and calmness often lead to more open communication and stronger connections with family or partners‚Äîmirroring Jack‚Äôs own transformation.
* Support for Age-Related Challenges: Men in their 60s and 70s claim renewed vigor and a greater inclination to stay active, underscoring the potential for wider demographic appeal.  

*‚ÄúDoes Nitric Boost Work for Me?‚Äù ‚Äî Adapting to Individual Lifestyles*

Professionals from all walks of life‚Äîteachers, office staff, and retirees note that an uncomplicated, once-daily practice integrates easily into packed schedules. Nitric Boost is designed to require only consistent use, without mandating strict diets or intense workout routines. Rather than insisting on a single lifestyle formula, the product focuses on supporting nitric oxide production and natural PDE5 inhibition. Ultimately, this core synergy remains beneficial regardless of how users choose to incorporate additional fitness or dietary strategies.

**Nitric Boost: Where to Buy, Pricing, and Promotional Bundles**

Growing interest in Nitric Boost Ultra often leads prospective customers to ask about costs, authenticity, and shipping policies. The¬†[**brand recommends purchasing directly from the official Nitric Boost website,**,](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net)¬†where buyers can find current pricing and special offers that may not be available elsewhere.

*Potential Bundles*

1. **Starter Package**¬†‚Äì A single container for those who want to test the product for about a month.
2. **Value Package**¬†‚Äì Three containers, typically offered at a reduced per-container cost.
3. **Best Value Package**¬†‚Äì Six containers intended for consistent, long-term use (up to six months). Many who leave Nitric Boost reviews mention more pronounced results after several weeks of ongoing supplementation.  

Nitric Boost coupon codes or seasonal Nitric Boost promo deals may be launched at different times of the year. Checking the official site allows consumers to see up-to-date discounts, possible free shipping, and occasional bonus materials such as e-books or supplemental guides.

* **Customer Support**: Dedicated email or phone assistance remains available for inquiries on usage, shipping, or product details.  

**Nitric Boost vs. Other Methods: Why Natural Support May Matter**

Comparisons often arise between Nitric Boost and stronger interventions. Traditional medication, injections, or high-stimulant pills can sometimes create short-lived improvements but carry the risk of harsh side effects or medical complications. By focusing on cGMP, PDE5, and nitric oxide pathways, Nitric Boost takes a gentler route, aiming to:

* Bolster the body‚Äôs own capacity for healthy blood flow.
* Assist in controlling stress and boosting mood through adaptogens like Ginkgo Biloba or Horny Goat Weed.
* Reduce reliance on synthetic stimulants, thereby minimizing jitters or crashes.
* Provide user-friendly usage that can align with daily life for the long haul, rather than a fleeting fix.

The brand underscores that ‚Äúfeeling great every day‚Äù is more realistic (and safer) when a solution complements natural physiology.

**Nitric Boost for Different Ages and Lifestyles**

One reason behind the rising popularity of Nitric Boost is its adaptability. While older men often seek support for male function or consistent energy, younger men‚Äîwhether college students, busy professionals, or new fathers‚Äîcan also benefit from extra stamina and mental clarity.

*Older Adults Embrace Gentle Support*

As men step into their 50s, 60s, or beyond, they may experience gradual dips in hormone levels and circulation efficiency. Nitric Boost aims to help stabilize these changes without resorting to invasive processes. The brand references personal accounts from men in their 70s who found renewed interest in physical activities and everyday tasks after a few weeks of usage.

*Younger Individuals Seek Daily Energy*

Younger demographics sometimes face fatigue from hectic schedules, long work hours, or stress from balancing multiple responsibilities. By fueling the body with nitric oxide‚Äìenhancing nutrients, Nitric Boost may support a stable sense of alertness, making it easier to remain productive, exercise, or enjoy social events. The brand‚Äôs disclaimers still advise checking with a healthcare professional if there are pre-existing conditions, but for healthy adults, daily use is described as straightforward.

**Nitric Boost Cost: Comparisons and Potential Savings**

Nitric Boost discount deals or bundle packages commonly highlight reduced per-container prices. The brand frequently references that many men choose a three- or six-month supply to achieve the best results.

* **Single Container**: Approximately $69 + shipping (pricing can vary).
* **Three Containers**: \~$177 (with possible free shipping).
* **Six Containers**: \~$294, dropping the unit price significantly and often including extra guides or freebies.  

By¬†[**purchasing from the Nitric Boost official website**](https://0a9fd7f0k-ha3l5kzas8wefv8h.hop.clickbank.net), users can access the Nitric Boost Ultra supplement guide, special e-books, or an extended refund policy‚Äîdepending on ongoing promotions.

**Nitric Boost: Ongoing Studies and Ingredient Integrity**

While Nitric Boost as a blend has not published peer-reviewed research, many of its constituents (L-citrulline, beet root powder, epimedium, etc.) have been individually assessed in nutritional science. Researchers globally examine how to enhance circulation through dietary nitrates or how PDE5 inhibition can support certain aspects of male wellness without drug-level side effects.

*Potential Expansion of Nitric Boost*

Given the growing attention on integrative health solutions, there could be future opportunities for Nitric Boost to collaborate with experts in urology, cardiology, or nutritional science. The brand suggests it is open to exploring new ingredient forms or researching complementary ways to enhance nitric oxide production. Yet, the current formula remains consistent with the success stories that built Nitric Boost momentum.

*Quality Assurance*

* GMP-Compliant Facilities: Manufacturing typically follows Good Manufacturing Practices.
* Third-Party Testing: Potential checks to ensure correct potency and absence of major contaminants.
* Ingredient Transparency: The brand highlights what goes into Nitric Boost to give customers confidence about purity and origin.  

**Maximizing Nitric Boost Results: Tips from Real Users**

For those eager to optimize Nitric Boost Ultra usage, community insights can be valuable. Common suggestions:

1. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration can amplify the benefits of amino acids and vitamins.
2. Gentle Exercises: Even light walks or bodyweight exercises could complement circulation gains.
3. Regular Sleep Patterns: Good rest often harmonizes with nitric oxide production and hormone balance.
4. Mindful Eating: While Nitric Boost does not require strict dieting, adding wholesome foods helps maintain consistent wellness improvements.
5. Daily Consistency: Because the formula accumulates in the system, skipping days can slow progress. Users often see the best outcomes when they make the ‚Äú7-second remedy‚Äù a non-negotiable habit every morning.  

Those with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to consult a physician before starting any new supplement, including Nitric Boost.

**Nitric Boost: Community Feedback and Future Directions**

As with any rising product, Nitric Boost Ultra has garnered a dedicated user community. People trade success stories, share dosage timing tips, and occasionally post about how they overcame initial skepticism. This organic communication fuels brand loyalty and draws newcomers interested in a gentler path to everyday vitality.

*Potential for Broader Wellness Applications*

Though primarily positioned as a male vitality supplement, some see Nitric Boost expanding its reach. The formula‚Äôs focus on healthy circulation, mild PDE5 support, and nutrient synergy may resonate with anyone seeking additional daily energy or stable mood support. The brand remains cautious about making broad claims, emphasizing that the formula is not intended to cure any specific medical condition.

**Nitric Boost Where to Buy, Money-Back Guarantee, and Customer Support**

Where to Buy Nitric Boost: The brand strongly encourages purchasing only from the official site to avoid imitations. Online marketplaces occasionally feature unauthorized sellers, leading to compromised quality or absent money-back guarantees.

Nitric Boost Official Support: A designated customer service channel can assist with returns, order tracking, or basic product questions. Refund windows (often up to 180 days) let people evaluate how well Nitric Boost fits into their lifestyle.

4. Track shipment updates via email or the brand‚Äôs official contact page.

Given its natural, non-habit-forming ingredients, Nitric Boost side effects are reportedly minimal. Still, everyone‚Äôs body is different, and mild digestive adjustments might occur as the system adapts to new nutrients.

* Caffeine Jitters? Unlike high-stimulant supplements, Nitric Boost Ultra contains no added caffeine.
* Allergenic Concerns? Users with specific allergies should read the ingredient list carefully‚Äîparticularly if they have sensitivities to certain herbs or vitamins.
* Medication Interactions? As with any supplement, individuals on prescription meds should consult a healthcare provider to rule out interactions.  

**Nitric Boost: A Vision for Empowered Living**

Though the brand‚Äôs name might imply a narrow focus, the deeper story revolves around people regaining confidence and well-being by working with their bodies rather than against them. Jack‚Äôs journey‚Äîbridging personal frustration to renewed optimism‚Äîbecame a catalyst for the broader conversation on how to naturally support circulation and male health.

Nitric Boost is anchored in the principle that small daily actions can lead to significant, life-affirming changes. With the brand‚Äôs emphasis on synergy, it encourages everyday folks to approach challenges‚Äîsuch as low drive, diminishing confidence, or general fatigue‚Äîin a balanced, mindful way.

*Encouraging Openness About Wellness*

Culturally, conversations about male vitality can carry stigma. The Nitric Boost story invites more openness, suggesting that seeking gentle, home-based support for daily energy is as normal as taking a multivitamin or morning jog. By framing these issues as part of overall health, the brand hopes to reduce the discomfort that sometimes stops individuals from exploring solutions.

For a few weeks I tested two options:  
**1. A 20‚Äì30 min gym session (weights + short cooldown)**  
**2. A 20‚Äì30 min jog outside (low pace, headphones on)**

Here‚Äôs what I noticed:

**Gym Breaks**:  
They feel efficient. I‚Äôd throw on a playlist, hit a few machines, and come back feeling like I ‚Äúaccomplished something.‚Äù But my brain wasn‚Äôt¬†*really*¬†clearer afterward ‚Äî I was more physically pumped than mentally refreshed. That said, it helped on days when I felt sluggish or frustrated from long flashcard sessions.

**Jogging Outside**:  
Honestly, this wins. The combo of fresh air, sunlight, and light cardio cleared my head better than anything else. Especially if I was stuck on a concept or overwhelmed by info-dense subjects (looking at you, biochem). I also started passively reviewing stuff in my head ‚Äî sometimes I‚Äôd even get little ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments mid-run.

The real game-changer though was pairing my breaks with focused review. I started using this AI app called¬†[QuizRevolt](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/quizrevolt-study-ai/id6744120654?l=en-GB)(it turns my lecture slides into flashcards and mind maps), and reviewing the cards right after coming back from a jog felt way more effective. Like my brain was just¬†*more absorbent*¬†after moving outside.

In the end, I still mix both ‚Äî gym if I want a boost of energy, jog if I need a reset. But if you‚Äôre looking for a brain-based break, go with the jog.

Curious if anyone else has found a sweet spot for study breaks that¬†*actually*¬†help retention? Would love to hear how others handle burnout or brain fog.",0,1754657331.0,studying_in_germany,4,0.33,False

Married with 3 kids.  Here are some decisions I made in the last 14 months (listed in order of extremeness IMO) that seemed to make sense for the good of our family.... wondering if I'm just being a good steward as intended or if I'm actually just being cheap?

1.  Had my wife quit her $40k/year job in June 2024 so she can be with the kids full time and homeschool them. I always expected her to work because that's nice extra money to live life with. But peace from crazy schedules seems to outweigh the cash.

2.  I bought a brand new Chevy Silverado in 2022 for $60k cash (we vowed to never do debt again).  Last month, after 3 years of ownership and only 11,000 mi.... I sold it to carvana for $46k.  Replaced it with a 2004 Toyota Sienna single owner with 170k miles.  I barely did any truck stuff with it, and I knew depreciation would eventually eat the entire 60k that I spent....

3.  Sold our two paid for jet skis that we used once or twice a season 

4. Sold our Kia Sorrento that was worth 30k and picked up a Tesla Model 3 for 19k instead, And we daily drive that thing like crazy.  It's basically free to drive when you look at price per mile compared to gas. This was the main driver - plus it's just a super fun car honestly! 

5.  Stopped paying for lawn care service this year as the price per cut was going up to $60 a cut, so I was looking at a minimum of $240 a month but sometimes $300 a month when there are five cuts.  Picked up a used riding mower for 400 bucks and spend about 2 hours a week total on lawn care. 

6.  Completely cut out overpriced coffee shops. My wife and I were each getting a Starbucks or dunkin' everyday to the tune of almost $15 total.  For some reason once I heard Kevin O'Leary won't pay for coffee and he's a billionaire, something clicked and I won't go back lol.

So there's no doubt that all of these moves added up to a ton of money saved each month and a stockpile of extra cash that I didn't have before.... But we obviously downsized our lifestyle quite a bit in the process.  

So for the wives out there..... Do you think like my wife thinks that I'm being cheap? This isn't a trick question... She hasn't accused me of that.  And the fellas out there, does any of this resonate as solid choices? Or do you think I should be lightening up and enjoying life more?",13,1754656630.0,Money,84,0.81,False

And I‚Äôll make sure of it. Time is my domain, and I know how to stretch it to make your procrastination feel *extra painful*. So, stop putting things off and just do the work.

**5. Be Useful to Someone Else**¬†You want to score points with me? Help someone who‚Äôs struggling. Volunteer, donate, or just be a decent human being. Also, if you‚Äôve got a closet full of junk, clear it out and give it to someone who needs it.

**6. Mantras Work. So Does Effort.** If you‚Äôre really feeling the heat from me, chant:*""****Om Sham Shanicharaya Namaha****""* Say it like you mean it. But let me be clear: You can chant all day, but if you‚Äôre still ghosting your responsibilities, I‚Äôm not budging. Effort + mantra = results.

**7. Fasting Is Basically Saturnian Gold** Skip a meal or two on Saturdays. You don‚Äôt have to starve-just show some restraint.

* Hardcore? Go water-only.
* Moderate? Fruit all day.
* Newbie? Eat khichdi (split mung beans + rice).

The point is to voluntarily restrict yourself before I *make* you feel restricted.

**8. Stop Blaming Me for Everything** Yes, I‚Äôm the planet of delays, challenges, and tough lessons. But guess what? I don‚Äôt *create* your problems-I just hold up a mirror to your karma. If you don‚Äôt like what you see, stop pointing fingers at me and start making better choices.

Look, I‚Äôm not here to make your life miserable. I‚Äôm here to make you better. Stronger. Wiser. If you can handle my lessons with grace, I‚Äôll reward you. And trust me, my rewards? They last.

Now, go forth and adult properly. And remember: every time you take responsibility or stick to a plan, somewhere in the sly, I‚Äôm nodding my approval. Just don‚Äôt expect a smile. I‚Äôm Saturn, not Jupiter.",1,1754656210.0,align27,0,1.0,False

1mktu2s,https://i.redd.it/slw7wxzahshf1.jpeg,Anyone know the title / author or have a link to this story?,"I‚Äôm supposed to be at work today, but I traded shifts with a coworker. Instead, I‚Äôm kneeling on the floor of one of the upstairs rooms, elbow deep in boxes I‚Äôve meant to clear out for months. Sunlight slants through the window, dust swirling in the beams, and I‚Äôm humming to myself, half-lost in the rhythm of an old song looping in my head.

Then the crunch of tires on gravel cuts through my reverie. Curious, I push up onto my knees and peer through the glass. Balen‚Äôs car rolls into the driveway. My heart lifts, silly with anticipation‚ÄîI‚Äôm home, unexpectedly, and maybe today he‚Äôll actually be glad to see me. Maybe this time, he‚Äôll want me again. It feels like forever since he last touched me with anything close to tenderness.

I‚Äôm about to step away from the window when another engine purrs up behind his. I blink, surprised. Cyrene‚Äôs car. My twin. The two of them, home together. For a brief, naive moment, I feel a childish surge of happiness. Funny, looking back, how nothing about this strikes me as odd‚Äînot then. I‚Äôm too trusting, always have been.

I linger by the window, invisible behind the curtain, watching as Balen steps out and turns toward Cyrene. He‚Äôs always kept his distance from her at family gatherings, their glances strange and unreadable, but nothing could have prepared me for what I see now. Cyrene launches herself into his arms, legs locking around his waist, and he catches her easily, kissing her with a hunger that leaves me hollowed out in an instant. A kiss so deep, so desperate, it makes my stomach drop and rage surge hot through my veins.

An affair. Of course. Is this why he hasn‚Äôt touched me in months? I choke on a sob, betrayal slicing through me, sharp and raw.

My mind scrambles for proof‚Äîanything to stop them from gaslighting me again, from twisting the story until I‚Äôm the one left doubting my own eyes. My hands fumble for my phone. I snap photos through the glass, capturing the two of them locked together, oblivious. He lifts her, her legs still cinched around his waist, carrying her toward the house, hands splayed on her thighs, her back. They don‚Äôt even try to hide.

Questions spiral: How many times have they done this? How far will they go, right here, in our home? In hindsight, the truth is obvious‚Äîthey‚Äôve been at this for a long time. But in the moment, I‚Äôm frozen, watching the lie of my life unravel with brutal clarity.

I slip from the window and crack open the upstairs door, heart pounding. Downstairs, Cyrene‚Äôs laughter rings up the stairwell, light and carefree. I pad quietly to the balcony, holding my breath, peering down at the lounge below. If I need to, I can dart into a spare room. But I need to see.

They don‚Äôt make it to the bedroom. I watch, unseen, as they tumble onto the living room floor, hands everywhere, mouths pressed together, discarding clothes in a frantic rush. My phone trembles in my hand. I flip to video, desperate to record it all before they have a chance to lie or deny. My tears smear the screen and my hands shake, but anger keeps me steady‚Äîanger at myself, at them, at years wasted on a man who never loved me at all.

Cyrene‚Äôs moans echo up the stairs. Balen is stripped down to his boxers, already on his knees between her legs, his head buried in her thighs.

He never did that for me. He always said he found it disgusting, that he couldn‚Äôt stand going down on a woman. So it was only me he found repulsive. The tears dry on my cheeks, replaced by a cold, burning fury. How long have they laughed about me behind my back? How long have I been the punchline to their secret?

I force myself to breathe, to steady my grip. I need this evidence.

‚ÄúOh, god, I am going to cum,‚Äù Cyrene cries out, voice shrill and unashamed. Balen doesn‚Äôt stop; he just kisses his way up her body, lavishing her breasts with the kind of attention he never wasted on me. His boxers hit the floor. He doesn‚Äôt bother with a condom. For me, there was always a condom‚Äîhe said he wasn‚Äôt ready for kids, that neither of us was. But for her, nothing. He thrusts into her bare, and I feel sick.

They writhe together on the carpet, a mess of limbs and sweat and breathless noise. Cyrene climbs on top, riding him with wild abandon. He urges her on, voice low and eager, ‚ÄúRide me, baby.‚Äù He used to complain when I tried to take control, claimed he hated it. Now, watching him with her, I realize he only ever hated it with me.

She cries out again, shuddering, and he flips her over, driving into her harder, sweat glistening down his back as he gives her everything he never offered me. Their pleasure is raw and unrestrained‚Äînothing like the cold, mechanical sex I endured. For Balen, I was a chore, a duty. For Cyrene, he is a lover.

When he finally collapses, spent, he gathers her close, kissing her gently, murmuring in her ear. He hasn‚Äôt held me like that in years. Maybe never. Jealousy stabs at me, then drains away, leaving only emptiness. Why should I envy her, anyway? She always got everything‚Äîmy toys, my clothes, my parents‚Äô affection. Now she has my husband, too.

He strokes her hair, voice thick with longing. ‚ÄúSweetheart, why won't you let me divorce Brielle and move in with you? I told you before‚Äîit was always you I wanted. Not her. You pushed me to marry her. I need you.‚Äù

My jaw clenches at the sound of my own name, at the revelation that I was never more than a consolation prize.

Cyrene laughs, rolling away from him, unashamed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you before‚Äîshe‚Äôs loaded. I‚Äôve burned through all my inheritance. I need you here. You don‚Äôt spend your paycheck on anyone but me, and she pays for everything else. No bills, no worries, and you get to buy me pretty things on her credit card. Why would I give up the best of both worlds? I get you and her money. Why change a good thing?‚Äù

He grins, teasing, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs harsh. You only want me for my money?‚Äù They both dissolve into laughter, a private joke I was never meant to hear.

Cyrene stands, slowly dressing, making a show of stretching and smoothing her clothes, as if daring me to watch.

‚ÄúBaby, I have to get back to work. See you later?‚Äù She leans down, pecks him on the lips, and heads for the door.

He calls after her, ‚ÄúWe still on for this weekend?‚Äù She pauses, tapping her finger on her lips, pretending to think.

‚ÄúOf course. You told her you had a seminar, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôve got a bag packed in the car. I‚Äôll call her, say I‚Äôm leaving early, and meet you at your place.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she says, blowing him a kiss, and skips out the door, light as air.

Balen dresses quickly, tidies the lounge, sprays air freshener in wide, guilty arcs. The scent is sharp and unfamiliar‚Äîone I‚Äôve never bought, never liked. Now the memory clicks into place. I‚Äôve smelled it before, lingering in the house, even before we married. How long has this been going on? Years? My entire relationship with him?

He leaves, locking the door behind him, and I am left standing on the balcony, shattered. Tears spill down my cheeks, but beneath the grief, a small, fierce satisfaction stirs. He signed a prenup before we married. I wonder if he ever told Cyrene about that little detail.

I square my shoulders, wiping my face. I have work to do. It‚Äôs still early‚Äîenough time to call my lawyer, to visit the bank, to cancel every card and close every account he‚Äôs siphoning from. I need to get ahead of them, to reclaim what‚Äôs left of my life before the weekend arrives. I refuse to see either of them again‚Äîat least, not until I‚Äôm ready.

Time to make plans.

Chapter 2
  
Brielle's POV

‚ÄúMr. Halborough, could I schedule an appointment for, say, two o‚Äôclock this afternoon?‚Äù My voice comes out steady, polite‚Äîno hint of the tears that wracked me for half an hour as I tried to process what I‚Äôd just witnessed. I‚Äôve forced the grief down deep, hidden the ache. Now there‚Äôs only business left: end this farce of a marriage, and maybe, if I‚Äôm lucky, find a way to make Cyrene pay for her part.

‚ÄúTwo o‚Äôclock? I can make that work. Could you give me a heads-up about the purpose of the appointment?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm filing for divorce,‚Äù I reply, flat and cold, the words suddenly real and tangible as they leave my lips. I feel the sting of fresh tears, but I clamp down hard. Not today. Not in public. I‚Äôm a doctor‚Äîtrained to keep my composure with the dying and the grieving. I can do it now, too. Treat the end of my marriage as just another death, and wall away the part of me that wants to scream.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I‚Äôll see you at two.‚Äù One task complete. What‚Äôs next?

I strip off my sweats and pull on a suit, wanting to look composed, untouchable. As I zip up the skirt, the song from our wedding plays through the house. My throat tightens and, despite my best intentions, tears streak down my cheeks again. Not for him‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt deserve that. It‚Äôs just for all I believed I had, for the story I told myself. But really, I‚Äôve lost nothing but my own wounded pride.

I reapply my makeup; as I‚Äôm brushing on mascara, a different song comes on‚Äîone that feels more honest, more like the woman I am now: ‚ÄúI See Red,‚Äù by Everybody Loves an Outlaw. The raw, vengeful lyrics pulse through me, and I start singing along‚Äîloud, off-key. Balen always claimed I couldn‚Äôt carry a tune, but right now, I don‚Äôt care. I belt out the words, mangling the verses and laughing at my own wildness. It helps, this rage. It steadies me. I want to hurt them as much as they hurt me.

The drive to the bank is strangely quiet, the city thinned out in the late morning. But inside, the line snakes back and forth, a slow, shuffling crawl. I wait, arms folded, until a concierge spots me and ushers me away from the crowd, into a glass-walled office.

‚ÄúWhat can we do for you today, Ms. Pendry?‚Äù the banker asks, all smooth politeness. He‚Äôs been warned; he knows I‚Äôm here to do something significant.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to close my account. Please issue a bank cheque for the balance,‚Äù I say, keeping my voice formal and even. He blinks, startled, as he realizes I‚Äôm closing out over a million dollars. For this little branch, I might as well be a visiting monarch. I hold his gaze and smile.

This is the first real step‚Äîa clean break, a severing of the last financial thread between me and the man who betrayed me. No more credit cards, no more automatic payments to his accounts. The cow is dry. Let Balen and Cyrene scramble now. I hope whatever he siphoned off was worth it.

I stride out onto the sunlit street, my mind buzzing with next steps. I‚Äôm so focused I nearly miss Calitha, ducking into a caf√© across the intersection. My feet carry me toward her as if I‚Äôm being pulled by a riptide.

‚ÄúHey, Calitha!‚Äù I call out, spotting her in a corner booth. She looks up, startled‚Äîher eyes red, mascara smudged. She‚Äôs been crying.

‚ÄúOh, hi Brielle. How are you?‚Äù Her voice is small, raw. I slide in beside her and wrap her in a quick, fierce hug, needing the comfort as much as she does. The waitress appears, hovering, so I shift back into my seat and force a bright smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have a peppermint tea. Calitha, coffee and cake? My treat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, please,‚Äù she says, managing a grateful nod. The waitress scribbles the order and retreats, muttering under her breath. I shake my head, banishing the negativity.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I ask gently. ‚ÄúWhy the tears?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy boss yelled at me this morning. It‚Ä¶ it just got to me, that‚Äôs all. No big deal.‚Äù She tries to laugh it off, but her hands twist in her lap.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still in real estate, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But the market‚Äôs slow right now. I‚Äôm hustling at the bottom end, while everyone else gets the big-ticket listings. I have to sell four or five properties just to meet my quota, while the favorites hit theirs in a single deal. It‚Äôs exhausting. And every time a high-priced home comes in, the boss hands it to someone else. I‚Äôm thinking about leaving, honestly. I‚Äôm not even sure he likes me.‚Äù

I reach across the table and squeeze her hand. ‚ÄúWell, today‚Äôs your lucky day. I need your help.‚Äù

She blinks at me, surprise flickering in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you? I feel like I‚Äôm always the one needing a hand.‚Äù

The drinks arrive. I wait for the waitress to leave, then glance around the caf√© to make sure we‚Äôre alone. I lower my voice.

‚ÄúMy husband cheated. With Cyrene.‚Äù

Her gasp is sharp and immediate. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt. That scumbag‚Ä¶ with her, of all people?‚Äù

I nod, jaw clenched. ‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs what I need: I want you to list my house. I don‚Äôt even see it as home anymore. Get your auctioneer guy to clear out the junk I don‚Äôt want. You can take everything in the fridge and freezer‚Äîshould last you a while. I‚Äôll need a moving van, some muscle to move what I‚Äôm keeping to my next place, and Balen‚Äôs stuff to Cyrene‚Äôs garage.‚Äù

She stares at me. ‚ÄúWhat new place? You‚Äôve already moved?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet, but I‚Äôm heading to work right now. There‚Äôs an offer on the table at a private hospital‚Äîif it stands, I‚Äôll take it. If I get the job, I‚Äôll come back to sign whatever you need to list the house. I want you to have the listing, Calitha. If any of your colleagues try to poach it, I‚Äôll refuse. This one‚Äôs yours. And I need a new place‚Äîgated, three bedrooms minimum, house or penthouse, near the hospital.‚Äù

Calitha‚Äôs eyes fill again, but this time it‚Äôs not from sadness. ‚ÄúFurnished or unfurnished?‚Äù She‚Äôs all business now, tablet out, fingers flying.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting from scratch. I don‚Äôt mind, as long as I‚Äôm not hauling old beds and couches. If it‚Äôs a penthouse, at least semi-furnished would be great.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me send you this,‚Äù I say, thumbing through my phone to find the land deed from my home purchase. I forward it to her.

‚ÄúThank you. Give me a couple hours‚ÄîI‚Äôll pull some listings and have the paperwork ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy lawyer appointment‚Äôs at two. I‚Äôll come by after?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù Calitha‚Äôs smile is bright, shaky‚Äîlike she‚Äôs just been handed a lifeline.

‚ÄúCan you have the auctioneer come over after we‚Äôre done? You handle the details. The sooner it‚Äôs over, the better. I can stay in a motel if I have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you the details later,‚Äù she promises.

I drain my tea, give Calitha another hug, and walk out into the bright day, hope flickering in my chest for the first time. There‚Äôs work ahead, and I‚Äôm not sure what the future holds, but I have a plan‚Äîand, for now, that is enough.

Chapter 3
  
Brielle‚Äôs POV

Fortunately, my boss isn‚Äôt busy when I arrive at the hospital. He looks up from his desk, warm and unflappable as ever, his easy charm undimmed by the stress of the job.

‚ÄúWhat brings you in on your day off, Brielle?‚Äù he asks, the corners of his eyes creasing with genuine concern. I‚Äôve always liked him‚Äîhe‚Äôs a straight shooter, compassionate without ever being sentimental.

I steady my voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going through‚Ä¶ a rough patch, personally. I wanted to ask if the private hospital job you mentioned is still open?‚Äù

He leans back and sighs. ‚ÄúThe one I offered you last month? That‚Äôs been filled, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù The floor seems to drop from under me for a split second‚Äîmy last hope for a clean break, gone.

But then he offers a lifeline. ‚ÄúHowever, I do have something else, if you‚Äôre interested. The research division of the heart clinic needs a manager. We‚Äôre running multiple trials; I need someone who can take charge and run with it. You‚Äôd work alongside Dr. Myndale, who manages the surgical clinic.‚Äù

I blink, stunned by the offer. ‚ÄúAre you serious? I‚Äôd love that‚Äîthank you. Yes, I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôve got the paperwork right here‚Äîtake your time, read it over and sign. Would a month be enough for you to get your personal affairs in order before starting?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs perfect,‚Äù I say, almost breathless with relief. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure having you here, Brielle. Why don‚Äôt you take the next two weeks off to get settled in Preston and start fresh?‚Äù

I stand, shaking his hand with a gratitude that‚Äôs hard to put into words. He never once mentions the mess in my personal life, and I am grateful for that, too.

‚ÄúTwo weeks is plenty,‚Äù I assure him, scanning the contract. I sign, almost in disbelief‚ÄîI‚Äôm about to earn more money than I did as a heart surgeon. The irony isn‚Äôt lost on me. I tuck the contract into my bag just as the receptionist appears.

‚ÄúMr. Halborough will see you now.‚Äù I‚Äôm ushered into my lawyer‚Äôs office. He‚Äôs older now, hair gone mostly gray, but still sharp-eyed and handsome in a dignified way. His son‚Äîmore youthful, but with the same steady gaze‚Äîsits beside him, quietly absorbing everything.

‚ÄúTalk to me, Brielle,‚Äù Mr. Halborough prompts. He‚Äôs been my lawyer since my grandfather‚Äôs day, always in my corner.

I draw a slow breath. ‚ÄúLet me show you something first. Then you can tell me if there‚Äôs any way I can get a quick divorce today.‚Äù I send the video across, watching as father and son view the damning evidence, my stomach twisting with every silent second.

‚ÄúWith this video and your prenup, we can have this in front of a judge within hours,‚Äù he assures me. ‚ÄúIf all goes smoothly, you‚Äôll be free by tonight. Any other issues?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I need to amend my will. Everything to charity, at least for now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted. Give me twenty minutes and I‚Äôll have the paperwork ready for you to sign.‚Äù

I hand over my bank statements, heart pounding. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt even supposed to have access to this much‚ÄîBalen had a ten-thousand-dollar daily limit, but he‚Äôs been draining the account over that, and the bank must be helping him. I closed it, threatened a lawsuit if they didn‚Äôt comply. Some of those purchases‚Äîgifts for Cyrene‚Äîwere made against my wishes. Can I get the expensive ones back?‚Äù

He‚Äôs already scowling. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs theft. The prenup is clear. We can threaten criminal charges if they don‚Äôt return them. Leave it to me.‚Äù He almost seems to relish the prospect; he never liked how Balen wormed his way into my life.

‚ÄúAnything we can do to make Cyrene sweat?‚Äù I ask, my voice tight. ‚ÄúYou saw the video.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing immediate, but I‚Äôll speak to the judge tonight‚Äîsee if there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve missed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait outside while you draft everything.‚Äù I step into the corridor and dial Calitha.

‚ÄúCalitha Serevan speaking, how can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúCalitha, I‚Äôll be over in about half an hour. Get everyone together‚Äîwe‚Äôre heading to Preston.‚Äù

She sounds relieved. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the papers ready, and I‚Äôve found a few places I think you‚Äôll love. Merek says he can be at your place around six. He wants pizza.‚Äù

I laugh, picturing Merek‚Äîour auctioneer‚Äîalways ready with a joke and an appetite. I could use some of his humor right now.

‚ÄúHow many are coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúTen. Is that enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than enough. See you soon.‚Äù I sign the legal papers, thank Mr. Halborough, and head for Calitha‚Äôs office.

As I enter, a sales rep I‚Äôve always disliked approaches, all shark-smile and calculation. ‚ÄúMs. Pendry, what can we do for you today?‚Äù To him, I‚Äôm just a commission check in designer heels.

Before I can reply, Calitha appears, stepping from behind a screen. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my guest, Mr. Jorlan.‚Äù The man scowls, slinks away, and watches us through the glass. I follow Calitha to her desk, glad I never had to work with him.

She slides the listing agreement across the table, along with a folder of property details. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the paperwork for your house at the price you wanted,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúand here are the houses and penthouses you might want to tour.‚Äù

I sign the listing, then scroll through the virtual tours on her screen. The second penthouse catches my eye‚Äîsemi-furnished, walking distance from the new hospital. ‚ÄúHow many units are on that floor?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúTwo. The other is owned by a young guy, quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll take this one. It‚Äôs listed at three and a half, right? Offer three million, cash. I want to rent it until settlement.‚Äù

Calitha dials the owner, her face lighting up as she speaks. ‚ÄúShe accepts‚Äîno charge for immediate move-in.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I pause, then hand Calitha a business card. ‚ÄúOnce you get your commission, leave this place. They don‚Äôt appreciate you. Try this agency‚ÄîI used them before, settling my grandfather‚Äôs estate. Use my name. You‚Äôll fit in better there.‚Äù

The rest of the afternoon blurs into a flurry of boxes and decisions. I pack my clothes, a few treasured things, and toss Balen‚Äôs belongings into suitcases and cartons. When Merek arrives, I hand him the key to Cyrene‚Äôs garage and the address, asking him to drop off everything of Balen‚Äôs.

By nightfall, the house is gutted, my car loaded with essentials, everything else en route to my new place. I book a motel and spend the evening out with Calitha and a handful of girlfriends, letting the laughter and noise drown out the ache.

Saturday dawns with the chatter of strangers in the motel hallway. Today is family lunch‚Äîan old tradition, whenever I‚Äôm not working. This time, it‚Äôs just me, my brother and his wife, and my parents. Time to break the news.

‚ÄúHello, dear, you‚Äôre looking well,‚Äù Mother greets as I step into the kitchen. She‚Äôs fussing over the stove, Dad and my brother already seated at the table. Lunch is a blur of small talk‚Äîmy brother and his wife are expecting their first, and everyone seems genuinely happy for them.

Then my mother turns to me, eyes sharp. ‚ÄúSo, Brielle, when will you and Balen give me a grandchild?‚Äù

I set my coffee down, gaze level. ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù

She blinks, startled. ‚ÄúNever? Why not?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more likely Cyrene will have his child first.‚Äù

Her lips curl with disdain. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt even have a boyfriend,‚Äù she snaps, missing the emphasis.

‚ÄúOh, but she does. Didn‚Äôt you know?‚Äù I feign surprise.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù she demands.

‚ÄúLet me show you.‚Äù I open my laptop, queue up the video, and turn it so everyone can see. Silence falls, thick and electric, as the footage plays. My mother‚Äôs face goes pale; my father‚Äôs eyes widen in disbelief.

‚ÄúWhen did this happen? It can‚Äôt be true,‚Äù she gasps.

‚ÄúYesterday. And it is true. As of last night, I‚Äôm divorced from that lying, cheating bastard.‚Äù

She clings to her fantasy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you could forgive him, Brielle. Cyrene must have her reasons‚Ä¶‚Äù

I cut her off. ‚ÄúYou heard their reasons, Mother. And where do you think they are now? They‚Äôre not at a seminar‚Äîthey‚Äôre on a dirty weekend, one they started yesterday. Your precious daughter‚Äôs been sleeping with my husband for years, burning through my money. When they come back, you can comfort her all you want‚ÄîI‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I rise and leave the house‚Äîthe house I grew up in, the house that never truly felt like home. No more playing the dutiful, forgiving daughter. No more sacrificing myself for their comfort.

Hours later, as I‚Äôm driving toward Preston, my phone rings. It‚Äôs Dad.

‚ÄúBrielle‚Ä¶I just want you to know, I‚Äôm proud of you. I always suspected something was off between those two. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt there for you. Your mother always took Cyrene‚Äôs side, told me to stay out of it. Maybe, when you‚Äôre ready, we can start over. I‚Äôd like that.‚Äù

I smile through sudden tears‚Äîthese, at last, are for something real.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that too, Dad.‚Äù

Chapter 4
  
Brielle's POV

The penthouse sprawls wide and open, every detail polished to modern luxury. But what truly catches my breath is the view‚Äîa glittering expanse of city lights stretching far into the horizon. Sitting out on the balcony, soaking in the pulse of nightlife, is a habit I know I‚Äôm going to love. The virtual tour didn‚Äôt do this place justice.

After a quick trip out to stock up on groceries, I step back into the private elevator, my arms full of bags covering every inch of skin. The soft ding of the elevator doors opening doesn‚Äôt prepare me for what‚Äôs next: stepping directly into a wall of solid warmth that most definitely does not belong there.

Caught off guard, I juggle the groceries, desperate to prevent wild oranges or rogue jars from escaping to splatter dramatically on the marble floor. Before I can fully panic, a hand reaches out and steadies me. The unexpected help eases the weight from my grip as the stranger takes a couple of bags from me.

Looking up, I find myself locked in a pair of stunning blue eyes set into a face that feels like the answer to a question I didn‚Äôt know I was asking. The grin he flashes splinters the tension, but it does something quieter too‚Äîsomething that warms places I‚Äôd long forgotten existed. His messy brown hair, like he just rolled out of a steamy bed, and his towering, muscular frame render me speechless. How had I wasted so much energy lamenting Balen when men like this exist in the same universe? My inner turmoil over the divorce evaporates under the weight of his physical magnetism. This man could resuscitate every dormant nerve I thought I‚Äôd buried.

‚ÄúNeed a hand?‚Äù His voice is casual but rich with warmth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tim. You must be my new neighbor?‚Äù

Tim. A name to go with all that visual poetry. As he turns effortlessly towards my door, the grace with which he balances the remaining sacks in his arms offers me a moment to memorize the taut line of his back. The man looks like every indulgent daydream I never had the courage to entertain.

Fumbling for words, I finally blurt, ‚ÄúBrielle. My friends call me Brie.‚Äù

His easy grin deepens. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Brie. Welcome to the top floor. So, tell me‚Äîdo you cook?‚Äù

The abrupt question startles a laugh out of me. ""I guess you could say so. Enough to keep myself fed. Nothing Michelin-star worthy.‚Äù I chuckle, appreciating the playful lilt in his demeanor.

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù he replies with genuine enthusiasm. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt cook to save my life. Maybe we strike a deal‚Äîyou cook some days; I order takeout for the others. Fair?‚Äù

I smirk back, finding an ache of amusement releasing tension I hadn‚Äôt noticed in my shoulders. ‚ÄúFast worker, are we?‚Äù

His laugh is low, but it ripples with good-natured mischief as he deposits the groceries onto my kitchen counter. Taking a moment to survey my penthouse, his gaze lingers over the space I‚Äôve already started making my own. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made it cozy already. The last tenant barely cared about decorating. She married some loaded guy not long before she left. But the view here‚Äîit‚Äôs incredible. You should swing by my place sometime. Ocean view. The sunset‚Äôs something else entirely.‚Äù

My heart hesitates, unsure where to place his invitation on the spectrum between casual neighborliness and something more. But before I can read too deeply into it, he announces he‚Äôs late for dinner with someone named Freyara and breezes out the door, leaving me blinking in his wake. A strange mix of longing and jealousy prickles at the edges of my thoughts, but I shove it away instantly, resolving not to turn this into an unrequited crush. Still, his parting grin lingers, tucked away in some vulnerable corner of my mind.

As his footsteps fade down the hall, I shake myself free and carry on until my phone interrupts the quiet. When I see the number, my chest tightens slightly‚Äîrecognizing Calitha‚Äôs effort to break some formality by calling instead of texting.

""You‚Äôre not going to believe this,"" Calitha blurts out excitedly as I answer. ""Five million, four hundred thousand! That‚Äôs the offer for your house.""

It takes a moment to process, but laughter bubbles in response. ‚ÄúAccept it. I don‚Äôt need the extra hundred thousand‚ÄîI just want that chapter of my life over.‚Äù

Within minutes, she drives over with the papers, and after cooking her a chicken stir-fry, we pop open a bottle of wine. Together, we celebrate‚Äîalbeit with guarded joy‚Äîa new beginning. Sleeping arrangements are resolved fast, and I finally collapse into bed, feeling lighter than I have in years. By morning, Calitha departs with assurances of handling all the details.

As the city gradually wakes, I sip a three-quarters warm cup of coffee on the balcony‚Äîentertaining fresh possibilities of freedom‚Äîwhen, without warning, my front door swings quietly open. Tim appears, his ease radiating a different flavor of confidence. My inner alarm should flare‚Äîwhy hadn‚Äôt I locked the door?‚Äîbut apprehension dissolves instantly into reluctant amusement.

""Good morning, sunshine,"" Tim teases with a grin so maddening it should be illegal. ‚ÄúLonely night?‚Äù

Raising an eyebrow, I counter sharply, ‚ÄúHow often did you walk into *her* place without knocking?‚Äù

It‚Äôs petty, but the question bursts out before I stop myself. His reply catches me off-guard. ""Never. She kept that locked tighter than a vault. And trust me, I‚Äôm not into gate-crashing sugar daddy arrangements, so don‚Äôt lump me in with that crowd."" For the first time, bitterness colors his tone.

Curiosity itches but remains buried for now. When he lounges at the kitchen counter a moment later, conversation shifts to lighter topics. By the time I‚Äôm cracking eggs to make a simple breakfast, my tension has thawed again, replaced tentatively by surprising comfort.

Chapter 5
  
Brielle's POV

Tim leaves with a cheerful goodbye, thanking me for a great start to the morning before heading off to work. His words linger in my mind as I finish loading the dishwasher, thoughts of the spots he mentioned sparking my curiosity. I decide to take a walk, explore the area, and map the route to my workplace. It‚Äôs practical too‚ÄîI want to know how much shelter the streets offer during winter‚Äôs inevitable downpours. Fifteen minutes later, I find that the path to work is short and manageable, flanked by storefronts and trees that promise some cover from the rain.

I decide on an impromptu visit to my new boss. As the overseer for both sections of the hospital, I want to introduce myself before my official start. I take the elevator to the fifth floor, unsure if he‚Äôll actually be in the office on a Sunday‚Äîmy previous boss was notorious for being a nearly permanent fixture in his. Outside the office, I pause to read the name engraved boldly on the placard: Dr. M Rellan.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù calls a deep, commanding voice from the other side. I step in, my eyes landing on a man in his sixties seated behind a desk cluttered with papers. His sharp, well-trimmed beard and sparkling eyes lend him a dignified charm, despite my usual indifference to facial hair.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I start with a smile, ‚ÄúI was passing by and thought I‚Äôd come introduce myself. I‚Äôm‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBrielle Pendry,‚Äù he finishes, standing to shake my hand before sitting again. I flush, embarrassed that he knows me while I struggle to recall him.

‚ÄúTwo years ago, you gave a brilliant presentation at Rosemount comparing open-heart surgeries to keyhole procedures. Cutting-edge stuff‚Äîyour articulation was impressive.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! That was a while ago. Honestly, I don‚Äôt remember you being there.‚Äù I stammer, my usual skill with names and faces betraying me.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt‚Äîtheater audience members seldom make an impression in reverse. Since then, I‚Äôve been nudging your former boss to transfer you here. Now that you‚Äôre finally on board, I‚Äôve no intention of letting you leave.‚Äù His laughter is warm, contagious, and I find myself chuckling along as he gestures to the chair opposite him. Settling into it, I wait for him to continue.

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs pre-arranged with your transfer from our sister hospital. No forms to fill out, fortunately,‚Äù Rellan explains. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be heading the research side while Dr. Morris focuses purely on surgery‚Äîthe job was too much for one person. He‚Äôs an exceptional surgeon and, frankly, so are you. You‚Äôll still find yourself in the operating theater often despite your research role, but we‚Äôll see how time and workload balance out. I suspect Morris and you will work well together. He‚Äôs in surgery now, so introductions will have to wait.‚Äù

He rises, smiling as he says, ‚ÄúLet me show you to your office and introduce you to the team.‚Äù

The hospital sprawls across five floors‚Äîits patient rooms resemble well-appointed motel accommodations, though some simpler ward options exist for those who can‚Äôt afford private suites. The canteen resembles more of a cozy restaurant, its enticing aromas filling the air. As we walk, I meet several staff members, all polite, their demeanor shifting to subdued awe when they realize who I am. My office is spacious, even sporting a window I doubt I‚Äôll have time to notice once work ramps up. Then, the research lab steals my heart. It‚Äôs immaculate, equipped for detailed autopsy analysis of hearts donated to science, complete with photographs and patient histories. My excitement crescendos‚ÄîI can‚Äôt wait to dive into work.

By the time I return home, the day has slipped toward evening, and the clock reads seven. Dinner beckons, so I reach for the steak and begin peeling vegetables, only to freeze as the front door swings open. Tim steps in, damp-haired and weary, as though fresh from a shower. His tired eyes tell more than his composed manner, though I resist the temptation to ask about the details of his Sunday workload. He‚Äôs off-limits‚Äîthanks to Freyara‚Äîwhether as anything beyond a friend or even a fleeting source of happiness. I remind myself sternly that rebound entanglements lead nowhere good.

‚ÄúGot enough for two?‚Äù he asks, already making a beeline for the coffeemaker.

‚ÄúSure, grab another steak from the fridge,‚Äù I reply, watching him comply. With practiced ease, he adds the second steak to the marinade before joining me at the counter, peeling potatoes alongside me. As we work, I tell him about my walk, omitting mention of my visit to the hospital and office. I mention the quaint caf√© I discovered, and Tim lights up‚Äîapparently, they serve his favorite cheesecake. Challenge accepted, I tell myself‚ÄîI‚Äôll prove my culinary prowess and best their recipe. I‚Äôd missed having foodie competitions since Balen, who steadfastly refused anything beyond steak and fries, dulling my creative streak.

Dinner is served on the balcony, paired with wine Tim produces from his stash. I rarely indulge in alcohol alone, untouched by the habit, but decide a vacation mindset warrants exception. Naturally, I ensure Tim enjoys more of the wine than I do‚Äîhis tipsy grin surfacing as I shepherd him toward the door.

‚ÄúBehave, or I‚Äôll start locking this,‚Äù I tease as he finally leaves, no resistance offered. Moments later, my phone buzzes, distracting me as I turn the lock. Without checking the caller ID, I answer.

‚ÄúHey, honey. Won‚Äôt be home tonight‚Äîflights are canceled because of the storm here. I‚Äôll call when I‚Äôm heading back. Talk later.‚Äù The words tumble out like an afterthought before he hangs up, the din of a party in the background impossible to miss. My chest tightens briefly; he clearly hasn‚Äôt gotten wind of the divorce.

Exhaustion creeps in, the toll of roaming, meeting people, and processing emotional baggage settling over me. Doctors learn to compartmentalize feelings for the sake of their patients‚Äô families‚Äîa defense mechanism I lean on now to separate myself from the pain of my dissolved marriage. A flawed approach, perhaps, but effective. The reminders to stay strong come unbidden. I‚Äôve endured enough gaslighting and secondhand emotions‚ÄîI refuse to let my past dictate my future. What I feel, I own, and I intend to keep it that way.

Chapter 6
  
Tim's POV

Running into Brie feels like an unexpected gift. She‚Äôs nothing like the last tenant of that penthouse, thankfully. When I wandered into her apartment earlier this morning‚Äîadmittedly, after barely knocking‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt kick me out. Instead, she invited me to share breakfast with her. There‚Äôs something there, something magnetic about her. She pulls me in like a moth drawn to a flame. Brie carries an air of vulnerability, like someone nursing old wounds, and I try to steer clear of anything too personal. Not that I have much to offer in that regard. My own personal life is practically nonexistent. My last relationship ended in a train wreck. She cheated on me, tired of the unpredictable hours of a surgeon‚Äôs life and the missed dates. She wanted more attention than I could give. One day, after a brutal shift, I walked into her apartment and found her tangled up with the neighbor. That was it‚ÄîI left and never looked back.

Brie doesn‚Äôt strike me as the gold-digging type, unlike the previous occupant of her suite. That woman snagged herself a tycoon old enough to be her father. But who am I to judge? Brie, though... there‚Äôs something genuine about her, something refreshing. I want to spend time with her, maybe share a few dinners.

Eating alone has its way of wearing you down. I‚Äôm not looking for another girlfriend, just a companion‚Äîsomeone to talk to, someone to break bread with. If it leads to more, that‚Äôs fine, but I don‚Äôt need it. There‚Äôs no shortage of women looking my way, but that sort of attention doesn‚Äôt appeal to me. I prefer doing the chasing. And truthfully, with the money I make and the lifestyle I‚Äôve built, I‚Äôve grown wary of intentions. A heart surgeon might as well walk around with dollar signs stamped on his forehead.

Today feels off‚Äîthere‚Äôs a dull headache, likely the wine Brie was generous with last night. She kept filling my glass more than hers; I noticed but let it slide. No harm done. I‚Äôm off work today, and an Advil should take care of the rest.

I decide a swim on the rooftop might clear my head. The space is private, shared only between Brie and me. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs explored it yet, but I‚Äôd like to mention it over breakfast‚Äîif she‚Äôs up for cooking again, perhaps she‚Äôll join me sometime. Taking the stairs two at a time, I swing open the rooftop door and freeze.

There she is.

She‚Äôs slicing through the pool with strokes that are hypnotic, perfect. Her body is toned, lithe, powerful. For a moment, all I can do is stand there, captivated. I toss my towel onto a deck chair and wait for her to reach the shallow end before diving in myself.

Swimming alongside her feels natural, easy. Her rhythm sets a good pace, not bad for someone who isn‚Äôt a professional athlete. Don‚Äôt misunderstand me; it‚Äôs not about her being a woman. But men tend to have stronger strokes, faster laps‚Äîit‚Äôs just biology. If I keep my usual pace, I would pull ahead of her easily, but that‚Äôs not what I want right now. Staying beside her feels better.

We swim for ten laps, neither of us breaking stride. Then Brie climbs out, water tracing her sleek frame. I push through twenty more laps before I follow her, stepping out of the pool dripping and energized. She‚Äôs already seated on a deck chair watching me.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she says with a smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got good form. And thanks for pacing yourself with me‚ÄîI know you could‚Äôve taken off.‚Äù

Caught. She‚Äôs sharp, this one‚Äîan astute observer who registers things most people overlook.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. Your form is impressive too‚Äîlong, measured strokes. It made matching your pace easy,‚Äù I reply. Her poise continues to surprise me. She‚Äôs neither flirty nor distant but strikes a rare balance. There‚Äôs no pretense in her demeanor, no attempts to impress me, and she isn‚Äôt hiding behind arrogance or defensiveness. She‚Äôs calm, accepting, somehow untouchable in her composure.

1mktsyu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mktsyu,Help! Crate training nightmare.,"This is Moose. He‚Äôs 14 weeks old. We have crate trained him since bringing him home at 10 weeks. He‚Äôs smart, full of crazy puppy energy, and a little love bug. But he‚Äôs going to make us lose our collective sanity. 

We have done the crate training thing before and we have owned difficult dog breeds (Rhodesian ridgeback, Anatolian shepherd). We expected a few days of adjustment but expected him to start to adjust to crate training within a week or two. Nope. He has multiple accidents at night despite us setting multiple overnight alarms to take him out. His behavior in the crate seems to be regressing since we started the overnight alarms and the accidents are worse. We know he *can* hold it overnight- he‚Äôs done it a few times. He will settle pretty quickly when we put him in his crate to go to sleep around 8:30, however he has now started to not settle nicely when coming back in from his overnight potty trips, despite us making it as quiet and calm as possible and doing nothing to get him worked up. Perhaps he‚Äôs just lonely in his crate, but we can‚Äôt have maniac behavior at 2:30am that lasts for 30+ minutes. 

Things we have done: 
- ensured the crate is the correct size. 
- multiple overnight alarms (currently 11:30p and 3a. We get up at 5:30a to start our day). When we get up we stay calm, lights stay off, no talking, no playing, just a quick trip outside to potty and quietly back in to bed. 
- remove water at 7pm unless very active
- last meal before 6pm, we try for earlier
- play session/walk outside before bed to help tire him out 
- vet check (he‚Äôs perfectly healthy, no medical cause for the regression)
- we have also tried just leaving him all night. This worked about 50% if the time, however we couldn‚Äôt just leave him to lay in his own filth so we started the overnight alarms.

Does anyone else have this experience. I am not knowledgeable about coffee. Is it the type of bean used in fashionable coffee shops?

The other day I was with my lady and we went to Fat Cactus in Gardens. The place was not full and the service was terrible. The women who was our waiter forgot she had us as her table and left us waiting for 20 minutes to get our drinks then other 1.5 hours to get our food. At the end of the meal when I asked for the bill she said ""so how much would you like to tip?"" Which left me speechless, I know it isn't a 5 star restaurant and things are less formal but she could've said ""here is the bill, how much would you like to make it?"" But now everyone in Cape Town is so entitled they think getting tipped is a right and not a reflection of good service. This wasn't just a one time thing, I've noticed it at several coffee shops and other restaurants at Waterfront. As a former waiter I understand how much tips help but this new younger generation of waiters are solely focused on getting tipped rather than serving. I even noticed it at Hudson's in Claremont the other night when I was out. The bill was R870 so I just rounded it up to R900 and the waiter looked disappointed. Am I sounding like an asshole?

As someone who starts every day with a fresh cup of coffee, this machine has completely redefined my coffee routine. This well-built, drip-style coffee maker feels premium everywhere you look, and its performance justifies its reputation. Crafted in the Netherlands, it‚Äôs obvious this isn‚Äôt your average coffee machine‚Äîit‚Äôs almost like it was designed by someone who truly understands coffee aficionados.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unpacked this coffee maker, I noticed how sleek yet classic its design was. It comes in a sophisticated off-white finish that complements just about any kitchen aesthetic. Its dimensions‚Äî6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches tall‚Äîmean it fits snugly on my countertop without overwhelming it. What stood out most to me was how durable it feels; this is not some flimsy appliance you're replacing in a year. The glass carafe and metal exterior are thoughtfully combined for durability and aesthetics.

**Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee with this unit couldn't be more straightforward. The single switch operation is almost comically easy when compared to many of today‚Äôs overly complicated machines. Its Brew-Volume Selector allows you to choose between half or full carafe brewing. Testing both configurations gave consistent results. Even when I was only brewing half a pot, the coffee tasted just as robust and flavorful as when I brewed a full 40 oz carafe.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b093dzt2rs/)  

**Performance and Brewing Time**  
This coffee maker heats water to the ideal temperature for coffee extraction, something many machines fail to perfect. It promises to brew a full pot in 4-6 minutes, which it delivered without fail every single time I used it. Plus, it‚Äôs surprisingly quiet while operating. I could hardly hear it brewing unless I paid close attention‚Äîwhich, frankly, is a blessing for those early mornings when I‚Äôm not fully awake yet. What truly sealed the deal for me is its hot plate. It keeps the coffee perfectly warm for an extended period, thanks to its independent heating mechanism.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Impressive coffee flavor consistency in both full and half pot modes.  
- Reliable hot plate feature that doesn‚Äôt burn the coffee but keeps it perfectly warm.  
- Extremely quiet operation, making it ideal for shared spaces or early mornings.  

**Bad Points**  
- The upfront cost might be steep for casual coffee drinkers.  
- It only works with paper filters, which may not appeal to those who prioritize reusable filter options.  

**Quiet Brewing for Busy Mornings**  
Given the automatic shut-off feature included, I never have to worry about accidentally leaving it on. This feature kicks in 100 minutes after brewing‚Äîa thoughtful touch for someone like me, who's often rushing in the mornings. The fully automatic operation mode also makes everything seamless; it‚Äôs literally as easy as pressing a button. No tinkering or additional steps required. 

**Competing Options**  
When evaluating this coffee maker, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to some alternatives. Machines from brands like Breville and Bonavita also promise high-quality coffee, but I‚Äôve used both, and they‚Äôre not quite in the same league. While Breville‚Äôs models often include complex interfaces, they can feel unnecessarily complicated. Bonavita‚Äôs coffee makers sometimes struggle with temperature consistency‚Äîsomething the Moccamaster excels at. That said, those other brands tend to provide more affordable units than this one, which is worth considering.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The price of the Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 KBGV Select is definitely on the higher side, but the five-year warranty is a safety net that ensures you‚Äôre getting your money‚Äôs worth. Machines like this aren‚Äôt just coffee makers‚Äîthey‚Äôre long-term investments for serious coffee lovers. I think about the cost per cup of brewing exceptional coffee at home versus buying from a caf√© every day; the value equation quickly starts to make sense.

1mkto8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mkto8y/sibling_rivalry_is_alive_and_well_even_when_its/,Sibling rivalry is alive and well‚Ä¶ even when it‚Äôs between skaters.,"When I first got sober, I started spending time at a little community center where people in recovery hung out. It wasn‚Äôt fancy, think broken couches, mismatched mugs, and a coffee pot older than I was, but it was full of good people trying to stay out of trouble.

One of the guys who really looked out for me was Danny. He was this wiry, tattoo-covered skateboarder in his 40s who could ollie over anything‚Ä¶ except his own pride. He‚Äôd been clean for a decade and had a knack for helping rookies like me get through the early days without losing our minds.

Then there was his younger brother, Troy. Troy was also a skater, but he had a chip on his shoulder the size of a half-pipe. He wasn‚Äôt exactly my biggest fan, I think he figured I was just playing at the ‚Äúclean life‚Äù thing and didn‚Äôt deserve Danny‚Äôs time.

One afternoon, Danny was helping me fix up an old skateboard I‚Äôd bought second-hand. I‚Äôd brought over some killer BBQ sandwiches for us to eat while we worked, and Danny cracked open a jar of homemade ghost pepper pickles his girlfriend had made. I‚Äôd grown up eating spicy stuff, so we were just sitting there happily sweating bullets and talking about grip tape when Troy walked in.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked. No heads-up, no ‚Äúhey, you busy?‚Äù Just waltzed in. I knew he‚Äôd want food, and sure enough, his eyes landed on the sandwiches.

Danny and I locked eyes, I swear the man can communicate full sentences without saying a word. The message was clear: *Don‚Äôt say a thing. Just follow my lead.*

Danny handed him a sandwich, then popped another pepper in his mouth. I did the same, making a show of how good they were. Troy squinted at the jar.

‚ÄúYou guys acting like that‚Äôs hot?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúDepends on if you can hang, man.‚Äù

Troy took the bait. He bit into one like it was a cucumber. Three seconds later, his face turned the exact shade of the pickle jar label. He started coughing, chugging water like it might save him from spontaneous combustion.

Danny nearly fell off his chair laughing. I was crying into my sandwich. It was the perfect prank, harmless, quick, and fueled entirely by that unspoken sibling competition that never dies.

I use a stovetop moka pot to make espresso, then dilute it with cold water, so I kinda drink one ""normal"" cup of black coffee (an americano prettymuch). I'm not a huge fan of hot coffee, so it's perfect for me.

However, I don't actually *like* the taste of coffee that much - I'm just used to drinking it. I have oat milk/sugar I could add so I'd enjoy it more, but the extra steps and variables are too much in the morning.

So, every morning, I dump a strong-ass cup of acidic coffee straight into my empty stomach ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My boyfriend (30M) , in the US. We've never met in person, but I've followed him on Instagram long before we spoke, because I loved his art. He is an amazing artist that has worked with some well known rappers in the past etc.

Two years of following him, I reached out. We started talking. One thing led to another, and three months ago, we became long-distance boyfriend and girlfriend. We are together for three month now, and we speak about closing the gap soon.

At first, it was amazing. We'd spend hours on FaceTime, watching movies together, talking about life, ordering food for each other through uber eats, discussing our traumas and achievements. We fell asleep on the phone, talked about our dreams and goals in life, discussed philosophy and our favourite books. He was funny, smart, charismatic, and he really listened to me, he was very consistent in showing up and spending time with me. I felt understood in a way I hadn't in my life. I have had boyfriends that lived in the same city as me and I still didn't feel as connected to them as much as I did with my current partner, despite being so far away, despite a 6 hour time difference and having very different cultures and upbringings. I've been abandoned by men my whole life and was cheated on and neglected by my partners in the past. Me have always betrayed me and left, including my father and I tend to have PTSD around relationships.

I am from the Middle East (Living in Germany for 10 years), first generation immigrant, raised by a single mom that was extremely poor but hard working. My mom would work all the time and still does. Growing up I was always scared and alone and never had someone who gave me that much time and attention, especially a man. Being a daughter to a single immigrant mom, her expectations of me are very high. I have moved countries three times and always had to start in pure poverty and in fear. Whenever I got attached to a place and felt like having roots, we had to move. I was not able to call a place home, stopped making friends and had a poor mental health. I faced racism and discrimination, I was betrayed by loved ones. This information might explain why I am not ready to let go of this man.

My problem in the relationship started when i got ""suggested accounts"" on Instagram. They were suddenly flooded with women that very extremely attractive and some of them where very sexual and semi naked. Women with big curves, perfect waists, posting very provocative pictures. I found out those accounts were suggested to me, because my boyfriend was following them. I am talking about the type of women who live the LA life, they could easily date NBA players. They were 10/10 and they looked nothing like me. They had piercings and pictures with their Nipples showing, and my boyfriend had liked most of their pictures before we got together. They weren't celebrities. Most were just regular people with small followings. Some were OnlyFans models. Many were Black but most of them are Japanese and Korean women, very short and petite, some of them wear lots of makeup and had plastic surgery such as BBLs. All of this made me feel even more insecure because I'm Middle Eastern, very tall, and skinny. Small chest, small butt. I work out and have abs and muscles, I dont think I am ugly but I am definitely very different from those women he follows. I am the  complete opposite of the type he seems drawn to. I also found out he paints a lot hentai female characters and has even purchase hentai NFTS before we got together.

One thing all women he follows have in common is the fact that they are very alt, and artsy. They work as models, photographers, djs, artists. They are all ‚Äúinstagram baddies‚Äù. I wear suits and button up shirts, I have 14 followers on my  instagram account that is private, I spend my free time studying mathematics and programming. I work at a doctors office as an assistant and on the weekends I work at a coffee shop as a barista to save money. l am currently working towards becoming a programmer and my school starts in a few weeks. The girls he follows are into partying, money, designer bags, drugs,travelling to expensive locations and art.

I decided to bring all of this up, when I saw he liked some of their provocative pictures when we were talking and he told me it was on accident, that he probably sat on his phone. After arguing a lot and almost breaking up over it, he promised to unfollow them. He did... maybe a couple hundred. But out of the ~2000 accounts he follows on Instagram alone, half are still these women. He also follows similar accounts on Twitter (he follows a lot of people over there, mostly women and he used to even repost them). I started wondering if this pointed to a corn problem, which for me is a boundary.

After three month of seeing no real improvements about this situation. We had another argument and broke up. He tried really hard to prevent it by crying and telling me to give him more time, that if he starts unfollowing all of them at once he might lose his platform and get shadow banned. He even said I am trying to destroy his art career. But I still chose to break up with him. That's when he showed me a helium tank (which he has purchased way before we even met) and told me he planned to kill himself. He's mentioned having suicidal thoughts during every argument, but I didn't realize how far it went and that he actually had tools for it stored. I panicked and told his parents, even though he told me not to. He told me if I told them, they will hate me. He said that I have ruined his life and now I am about to ruin his family life and that I should leave him alone. I decided to tell them anyways and they didn't react, which made me wonder if they'd heard this from him before and are used to him acting this way.

During our no-contact period, I told my mom everything, i showed her the women he follows, the hentai NFTs he purchased, the helium tank, even some unnecessary strange lies. Now my mom dislikes him. She thinks he's manipulative, a love bomber, a narcissist, a liar, and possibly has a sex addiction. She's convinced he's dangerous, especially since he still keeps the helium tank in his room. She says he probably did this to all of his ex partners and even threatened to kill them if they tried to leave, or he thought about killing them at least without mentioning it to anyone. She believes he's only with me because he's in a low point in his life, and that once he gets better, he'll leave for the type of women he actually desires.

She also doesn't like what she's heard about his family. For example, his mom used to buy him Playboy magazines so he could cut out pictures of naked women for his art. My mom says that's inappropriate and that our family values don't align.

My boyfriend also has a history of failed relationships where, according to him, he's always the victim. He's told me stories about exes who cheated, physically abused him, did things to him physically that he didn‚Äôt consent to, tried to stab him, unalive him or tried to ruin his career. In every story, he's innocent and unlucky, and his only fault is that he chose bad people and that he is such a hopeless romantic and these women took advantage of the fact that he didn't want to leave them. His last relationship was two years ago. 

His ex girlfriend slept with his best friend and made a video and sent it to him after they had broken up. When he showed no signs of emotion towards the betrayal, she started using other tactics to make him upset. She told him that she was r___ in those videos. he tells me the reason why they broke up was because she wouldn't go to work and he had to financially support her and pay for the rent of the apartment they shared together, had to clean and buy food. Her parents were against her dating a black man (She was south Asian and according to him a very small petite girl, for some reason he had to include that description lol) so they had abounded her, made her choose between them and him. So he decided to end things with her for good and that's when she started sending him those types of videos. After the last relationship, he fell into a hard depression and has gained a lot of weight, stopped painting and selling art, eventually he lost his apartment and had to move in with his mother at age of 28. He currently lives in his mom's basement, has no friends, doesn't go out, doesn't do sports. Art is the only thing he does, but when he's upset, he stops doing it altogether. Even his mom told him she's afraid, because it seems like he only thrives and does things when he is in a relationship, and if this were to end he'd end up in the same situation again. Depressed and suicidal. That's why my mom thinks he is narcissistic. She says he has nothing going on for him and he makes women his only purpose and if he doesn't have a partner, he doesn't have a reason to do anything. She says he is a weak man and can never make a good husband and be a good father. And because he depends on women romantically, he could potentially be dangerous. She says that he is going to use me mentally and physically, and when he is finally at a place where he is more confident in his body and career, he will leave me. She says it's not normal for a 30 year old to cry after every fight and threaten to kill himself. She thinks he might even harm me if I tried to leave.

Despite everything, I went back to him after a few days of ignoring his calls. I love him. He feels like my best friend. But now my mom has given me an ultimatum: if I stay with him, l won't be able to mention his name to my mother and if I ever end up meeting him IRL, she'll cut me off completely. She told me every time she hears me speak to him, her skin crawls and her heart aches. She asks herself ""why is my daughter so naive and broken that she chooses this man, who will cause her a lifetime of suffering and will eventually stop her from growth?"".

There are a few things I am leaving out because I can't think of everything atm.

I'm torn. I see the red flags. But I also have hope when it feels like I shouldn't. I keep thinking maybe, if we communicate enough, things could work.

Keep in mind him and I talk about getting married and moving in together eventually sometime in the future. I have been very serious about this person up until now.

Am l ignoring obvious danger signs? Or is my mom judging him too harshly because of her past relationships? I need advice. Please be kind.

TL;DR: TL;DR: I (25F, Germany) have been dating a man (30M, US) long-distance for 3 months after meeting on Instagram. He follows hundreds of provocative women online, made suicidal threats (showed me a helium tank) when we briefly broke up, because he didnt manage to unfollow these women on his social media, and has a history of painting himself as the victim in all past relationships. My mom says he‚Äôs manipulative, possibly dangerous, and will cut me off if I stay with him. I love him, but I‚Äôm torn between him and my mom‚Äôs warnings",1,1754655430.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

Everything seems to light up, the chrome coloured cars parked on the edge of the road emit a glare which distracts me from the straight path in front of me. The windows look like paintings containing people smiling and reminiscing to each other as they sip their coffee, distracting me from the picture I hold in my hand, also in front of me. I shuffle through the crowds of colourfully clothed people standing next to comfortable yet pretentious stone buildings. The buildings which now contrast their previous selves, in all the years I've lived in this city anyway. Looking at the unbothered faces, sitting outside, enjoying themselves. Today is irregular.¬†

I was starting to believe this could become normal, until I saw his face. The man in my picture, the picture I was distracted from looking at, and suddenly the facade had begun to slip. Although it pains me, I suppose I'll have to rip the curtain down, as it's the only way I'll get paid. I approach the man sitting beside what seems to be his family, enjoying his irregular day by their side. Holding the picture up, the connection becomes clear. I ask him if his name is Humbert as I reach for my left inner jacket pocket. His response is the trigger as I reach for my gun. Now I'm holding it pointed directly at his chest. My weapon is chrome yet it doesn't emit any glare, it doesn't distract me. Three shots and his blood splatters along the windows, the painting is ruined. The movements of foreigners become frantic as the locals' faces revert back to their former mold. Amidst the chaos I slip into the crowd, amidst the screams my footsteps are masked. Now, today is regular.¬†

I'm just like everyone else, I think, I feel. I work at a job, one that's like any other. One that's simple. Others around me say stuff like ‚Äúim an accountant‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI work in a restaurant‚Äù whatever. These jobs may be different, yet it's only one certain thing. Accountants work with numbers, chefs work with food. Yet they both have in common the fact that doing them correctly, following the instructions, means you get paid. My job is the same, I follow the instructions, I get paid. The only difference is I kill people.¬†",1,1754655406.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False
