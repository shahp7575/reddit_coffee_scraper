1m2hxi1,https://i.redd.it/r2f3xchorhdf1.png,"Shattered by the Alpha, Stronger Than Ever","Chapter 1

The moment that slap landed, the world went eerily silent.



Alpha Kael Creed’s hand sliced through the air like a blade. And then a sharp crack echoed through the room.



My head snapped to the side. A metallic taste flooded my mouth, and a ringing noise exploded in my ears like a swarm of bees trapped in my skull.



I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the desk, my fingers trembling.



My left cheek went numb before it began to burn—hot, sharp, humiliating.



When I looked up, Kael’s hand was still hanging midair, his knuckles bone-white with tension.



My mate. My fiancé. And now the man who’d just struck me in front of everyone—to defend his precious Beta—Riley.



For a brief second, Kael’s expression faltered. A flicker of guilt. But it vanished, swallowed by rage and impatience.



“Talia, can you stop making a scene for once?”



Someone snorted. A few others chuckled under their breath. No one stepped in.



Riley stood beside him, chestnut curls catching the light like strands of honey. Her red lips curled into a lazy, mocking smile.



“Kael, don’t be so harsh. Look—you’ve scared your little mate. Poor thing’s about to cry.”



Kael’s jaw tightened, his eyes still smoldering, but he reined in his tone, voice sharp yet measured. “Talia, this is Ashveil Pack, not Silverclaw. Try to remember where you are.”



The room buzzed with murmurs and half-stifled laughter.



I touched the corner of my mouth. It came away wet, though I couldn’t tell if it was blood or tears.



Eighteen years of knowing this man. I’d seen every side of his temper—but I never knew a slap could sting this bad.



Humiliation, rage, and heartbreak twisted together like barbed wire in my chest.



I dug my nails into my palms, swallowing the scream lodged in my throat.



Kael started to say something else, but I didn’t care anymore.



I turned on my heel, grabbed my bag, and shoved the glass doors open.



Behind me, someone let out a sharp whistle. “Look at her run. She waddles like a damn penguin!”



I had no idea where I was going—I just knew I couldn’t stay here.



I couldn’t stand one more minute in Ashveil Pack. Not with those eyes on me. Not with that handprint burning on my face.



Sure, Kael never had much patience with me. But he’d never hit me before.



This wasn’t just a slap. It was the first time in my life someone had ever struck me.



Not even when my world first fell apart at six years old.



Back then, Silverclaw Pack was attacked, and my parents moved us into the Ashveil Pack for safety.



That’s when I first saw Kael.



He was sitting in the yard, playing with a toy truck. Sunlight streamed down, stretching his shadow long across the ground until it brushed the tips of my shoes.



We grew up next door to each other.



My mom used to say we were like two saplings growing side by side. Only… Kael grew faster. Stronger.



When we were in grade school, a boy named Tommy stuck a wad of chewed-up gum in my ponytail.



The class burst into laughter.



The teacher tried to smooth it over. “He just likes you, sweetheart. Boys tease girls they like. Don’t cry.”



Those words stung worse than the gum.



After school, I cried all the way home.



Kael’s father, David Creed, heard what happened. He called out to his son, who was doing homework on the floor.



“Kael. Tomorrow. Go have a word with Tommy in second grade.”



The next day, Kael stormed into my classroom and kicked the back door open.



He moved like a wild little beast, charging Tommy with his tiny fists clenched. He slammed a fist on the boy’s desk.



“Listen up,” he growled, grabbing Tommy by the collar—still speaking in that soft, childish voice. “Talia’s my little sister. If you ever mess with her again, I’ll end you.”



Before leaving, he patted my head.



And from that moment on, I became Kael’s shadow.



Chapter 2

Back in middle school, Kael would always hit the field after class to play soccer. His teammates would drag him off for ice cream, and I’d squat on the sidelines with my backpack, waiting so long that my stomach would start growling.



He’d grumble and yank me up by the arm. “Talia, are you glued to me or something?”



But he’d still break his strawberry popsicle in half and give me the bigger piece.



As I remembered, he hated when people said he ""hung out with girls.""



One time I went looking for him, and his buddies started teasing, “Look, Kael brought his little mate!”



He got so pissed he chucked his whole bag of marbles down the storm drain.



But when I missed school the next day with a fever, he skipped class, climbed the fence, and showed up outside my window.



He tossed crumpled notes through the screen, each one scrawled with a messy little joke meant to make me laugh.



By high school, I caught him staring at me more times than I could count—when I was chewing on a pen while solving equations; when I tucked my hair behind my ear; even when I dozed off on my desk.



His gaze would land softly on me like the brush of a summer breeze—barely there, but impossible to ignore.



One morning, I turned around suddenly and caught him in the act.



“Kael,” I said, locking eyes with him, “how do you solve this problem?”



His pen slipped right out of his hand.



Sunlight poured in through the windows, lighting up the tips of his ears until they looked like they were glowing.



“I, uh...” He scrambled to pick up his pen, his bangs brushing my fingers. “It’s just... I mean...”



His voice trailed off into a mumble.



I rested my chin on my hand and just watched him.



Turned out, the same boy who once punched another kid for bullying me—would tremble just from being near me.



Outside the window, moonflower petals drifted down like snow onto his open textbook.



On the night I turned eighteen, under the glow of the full moon, our wolves finally recognized each other.



My wolf had no doubt: he’s the one. He’s our mate.



Our parents were overjoyed and immediately proposed a union between the packs.



And Kael? He pulled me into the fire escape and slammed the door behind us.



The motion-sensor lights flickered overhead. His palm was clammy, but his grip on my fingers was so tight it almost hurt.



“Think this through,” he said hoarsely. “You’re still young. What if... What if someone better comes along someday?”



I reached up on tiptoe and pressed my fingers over his lips.



“There’s no one better than you, Kael.”



He flinched like I’d shocked him—then kissed me like he was finally letting go of every hesitation he’d ever had.



In the dark, I touched the scar on the back of his neck—the one he got in eighth grade, shielding me from falling debris.



That night, moonlight filtered through the iron grates, casting broken shadows over us both.



And his amber eyes shimmered like something out of a dream.



After college, I joined the Ashveil Enterprises—a company long controlled by Kael’s family, and ended up working under Kael.



Everything was perfect.



Right up until we were about to get engaged.



That’s when she showed up.



Riley.



An Omega transfer. Kael’s new Beta.



From day one, she played the sweet girl card hard—handing out coffees with a megawatt smile.



“Nice to meet you all! I’m looking forward to working with you!”



But when she reached my desk, she froze.



“Oh my god...” she covered her mouth with a giggle. “Are people still using Hello Kitty thermoses?”



I didn’t say anything.



She bit her lip. “Oops, I didn’t mean it in a bad way! I just say what’s on my mind. No offense, okay?” She leaned closer. “But seriously... aren’t you a little old for all this cutesy stuff? I thought women in the workplace were supposed to be, like, elegant and put-together.”



It felt like the whole office turned to stare at me at once.



My Hello Kitty keyboard, the figurines on my desk, the pink dust covers around my monitor...



Kael used to call these things “Talia’s fortress.”



Now, under those judgmental eyes, they felt like a childish display begging to be laughed at.



My ears rang like someone had poured acid into my skull.



Riley's constant laugh drilled straight through me, loud and shrill, like a jackhammer cracking open the little world I’d built for myself—cute, safe, and stupidly naive.



“Geez, relax. It’s just a joke, grandma. Don’t tell me you can’t even take a little teasing?”



My knuckles went white, fingers digging into the hem of my skirt.



“Enough.”



Kael’s voice rang out behind me.



I turned and saw his mouth curled in a sharp, dangerous smile—his signature tell when he was pissed.



The sun backlit him from the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving his profile a golden edge.



For a second, he looked just like the boy who once beat up a classmate for gluing gum in my hair.



Riley pouted. “Sorry, I was just joking. You’re not really going to overreact like this, are you?”



“This isn’t a coffee shop. If you want to gossip, Riley, then maybe you should quit and go start a podcast.”



She slunk back to her desk, face stiff with barely concealed rage.



Chapter 3

I don’t even know when things changed between Kael and Riley.



It was like I blinked, and suddenly… the lunch our housekeeper sent over from home came with three sets of utensils.



I stared at the takeout bags, my voice shaking. “There’s nothing here I even like.”



Kael didn’t even look up from his reports.



“We’re doing salads today. Riley says it’s good to cleanse the system once in a while…”



Riley slid into the seat next to me, holding her designer coffee like it was a prop in a rom-com.



“Oops! My bad, Talia\~”



Her manicured nails tapped on the lid, sending out a hollow rhythm.



“I forgot you’re not into salads. But hey, grown-ups do need to eat healthy sometimes, right?”



She left the rest unsaid—but the smug curve of her lips finished it for her.



I looked at her, my voice quiet but steady.



“You keep saying my name like we’re best friends or something. Newsflash—you're older than me. Should I be calling you grandma?”



The office went dead silent.



For a second, Riley looked like I’d slapped her. Her perfectly winged eyeliner twitched.



That’s when Kael finally looked up from his desk—just to frown at me.



“Talia, that was uncalled for.”



Once upon a time, he punched a kid for calling me a crybaby.



Now, he was scolding me—for bruising another Omega’s ego.



I laughed once, short and sharp, and turned on my heel to leave.



Kael instinctively reached for me.



But when he pulled me into his arms this time, I caught a different scent on his shirt—Riley’s perfume.



Even his compromise felt dismissive.



“Alright, alright. I’ll tell the housekeeper to make you steak tomorrow, okay?”



Riley’s face twisted for a split second.



And that was the beginning of the end.



From the next day on, Riley turned it up a notch.



I walked into the office with my light pink tote, a tiny Lina Bell charm dangling off the zipper.



The moment she saw it, she gasped dramatically and pitched her voice to theatrical levels. “Oh. My. God. A Chanel tote and a cartoon keychain? That’s… a bold combo, babe.”



A few of the male coworkers chuckled behind their screens.



At lunch, I pulled out a disinfectant wipe and gave my disposable chopsticks a quick swipe.



Riley leaned over, smiling like we were besties. “Aw, that’s cute. You still do that?”



She turned to the guy next to her and added in a stage whisper, “I swear, she treats everything like it’s biohazard season.”



They both laughed like it was the funniest thing they’d heard all week.



Then came the annual department reshuffle at Ashveil Enterprises.



I was lugging my monitor across the room, arms aching, when I finally stopped to catch my breath.



Riley slammed her desk for attention like she was about to break into a comedy routine. “Everyone look! Disney princess down! Any brave knight wanna help our damsel in distress?”



She and the others burst out laughing. Some even clapped.



It was humiliating.



Kael—at least at first—would frown and mutter,



“Cut it out. Don’t go too far.”



But Riley always laughed sweetly and brushed it off. “C’mon, I’m just joking! Talia’s always so uptight—I’m just helping her loosen up!”



And Kael… paused. Then nodded. “She has been kinda sensitive lately. Girls these days, I guess…”



Riley grinned and playfully punched his shoulder.



“Hey! Don’t lump me in with her. I’m not the same.”



Kael chuckled, his eyes softening.



Like she was something special.



My chest tightened.



So that’s how he saw me now—delicate, moody, too much.



To Kael, anime was childish.



Being tidy meant I had “issues.”



Quiet meant I was “too shy.”



But once, just once… he used to call all those things my sparkle.

Both were solid—but one was an easy favorite.

**Brew setup for both:**

* 18.5g in → 37g out
* 30–32 seconds
* Rancilio Silvia + Baratza Sette
* Tasted as straight shots, 4oz cortados with whole milk, and iced oat milk lattes

# [Decaf Asterisk – Olympia Coffee](https://go.shopmy.us/p-21373481)

Origin: Colombia, La Plata

Process: EA Sugar Cane Decaf

Roast: Light-Medium

Roaster Notes: Milk chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker

**Rating: 5/5**

This one’s a home run. Smooth, sweet, and comforting. One of the few decafs I’d happily keep in regular rotation.

**Straight shot:**

Milk chocolate and marshmallow are front and center. Really clean and cozy—great texture, no weird decaf tang.

**Cortado:**

Basically s’mores in espresso form. Balanced, chocolatey, and deeply satisfying. Zero bitterness.

**Iced oat latte:**

Leans into the hot cocoa profile. Think chocolate milk with structure. Super approachable and mellow.

[La Angostura Decaf – Civil Coffee](https://go.shopmy.us/p-21373435)

Origin: Chiapas, Mexico

Process: Mountain Water Decaf

Roast: Medium

Roaster Notes: Dry berries, sugarcane, cocoa, citrus zest, burnt caramel

**Rating: 3.5/5**

More complex, but harder to love. Some fun flavor notes, but it felt a bit inconsistent and didn’t mesh as well with milk.

**Straight shot:**

Lots going on—bright citrus, cocoa, and a kind of sweet potato depth. Interesting, but a little sharp.

**Cortado:**

Milk softens the edges, but it loses definition. Not bad, just doesn’t quite come together the way you want it to.

**Iced oat latte:**

Hints of caramel and citrus, but kind of disjointed. Not as smooth or comforting as Asterisk.

**Final Thoughts:**

If you want a decaf that works effortlessly across espresso styles and really shines with milk, **Olympia’s Decaf Asterisk** is the clear winner.

**Civil’s La Angostura** is a fun option for more adventurous palates—interesting and layered, but not as dialed-in for daily espresso use.",1,1752782918.0,u_sprodoe,0,1.0,False

When I got home, I saw my daughter lying in bed with a fever and unconscious because of the shock. My heart was broken.

My daughter frowned and cried nightmarishly, ""Dad, help me … ""

The helpless whine, like an abandoned beast cub, made my heart bleed.

I went back to the bedroom and found the divorce agreement from the deep of the cabinet. When David came out of the bathroom, I had wiped away my tears. The half-open white shirt revealed a strong chest and a few fresh lipstick marks.

When he saw me, he was stunned for a moment.

However, he did not feel guilty about his daughter's experience at all as he quickly yelled at me in the first sentence he talked to me, ""Did you know that returning to the ship without permission almost destroyed Yates Corporation's business worth hundreds of millions?!""

""You and our daughter were really selfish.""

My heart clenched and I bit my lip.

""Did you want me to watch my child being bullied by others?""

A trace of surprise flashed across his face and then he changed the subject with a cold look.

""There was a very important party next month and you and Charlotte needed to attend together.""

I paused, shook my head and said, ""I couldn't go.""

After all, next month, I would no longer be his wife as he wished.

""Why couldn’t you go?""

David frowned and then he seemed to understand something.

""Was this it because Charlotte said bad things about Jessica, so I gave her a little lesson and you were giving me a face now?""

""Besides, I told you on the first day of our marriage that I had someone I liked. Don't forget it.""

My heart felt like it had been stabbed and waves of continuous pain emerged. Ten years ago, when my mother told me that David and I were engaged, I had been ecstatic because I had had a crush on him since I was a child. But on the happiest day, David had given me the heaviest blow.

""I had a lover, but she was just an ordinary girl from an ordinary family, so I couldn’t marry her.""

That night, he had been drunk and stared at me coldly.

""I would control the Yates Family within ten years and then no one could stop me! So don’t expect me to fall in love with you. We would automatically divorce after ten years.""

That night, I had signed the contract but cried all night in the cold yard. In the second week of our marriage, Jessica boarded a plane to a foreign country because of a quarrel with David. So, he went on to find her.

At that time, David didn’t go home all night and when he came back, he was always drunk and treated me like nothing. Until that night, he came back drunk again and hugged me passionately. But when he kissed me on the bed, he called Jessica’s name over and over again.

""Jessica, I wouldn’t let you marry anyone else! You could only be mine!"" I cried under him with tears, nails dug into my palms and blood dripped into the sheets.

That was our first night, but David frantically called out another person’s name all night. When I woke up the next day, David saw my red and swollen eyes. He was stunned for a moment and finally got out of bed without saying a word.

I also pretended that nothing had happened, prepared breakfast and work documents for him and sent him out to work. Since then, I had been more considerate.

David was tired and had a stomach disease, so I learned about healthy food and prepared his three meals in person. He was under great pressure at work, so I took the initiative to give up my career, became his subordinate and took on the most tiring work.

Later, we had a daughter and gradually, David seemed to treat me as his wife.

David began to bring me various gifts when he came back from a business trip. He would bring me a glass of milk when I couldn’t sleep. He would even accompany me and my daughter to watch the stars on the terrace late at night.

His hot body temperature covered me from behind like a close lover.

Gradually, it seemed as if we had never signed any divorce agreement. I had naively thought that he might have really fallen in love with me. But more than three months ago, Jessica suddenly returned to the UK with her adopted son, Gregory.

David returned to her side as soon as he heard the news. He spent her birthday with her and accompanied her and Gregory to watch the meteor shower.

He even gave up an important business trip just because Jessica said, ""I had a nightmare … ""

When I saw David letting his daughter suffer such torture for Jessica, I woke up. He had never loved us, his wife and daughter. I gave everything for him, but it couldn’t match the look of his first love. The dream was over and it was time to leave.

""Remember to dress Charlotte nicely when the time comes. Don’t embarrass me and the Yates Family.""

David's voice pulled my thoughts back and I looked at him in a daze.

Didn’t he remember that we automatically canceled the engagement in half a month?

Chapter 2

In the past ten years, the closer I had gotten to the day when the contract expired, the more afraid I had been, fearing that he would abandon me without hesitation when the deadline came. But as the date approached, David never mentioned it.

Just when I had hesitated about whether to take the initiative to ask for a divorce, David's phone suddenly rang with a series of unique ringtones. I had known that he had set it up for Jessica, to ensure that he could receive her call as soon as possible.

As soon as the call connected, Jessica's crying voice came from the other end and David's face suddenly changed.

""Don’t worry, I’ll be there soon.""

David rushed out while speaking. Because he had been too anxious, his shoulder had hit me heavily. I had hit the wall and felt dizzy from the back of my head. But David had ignored it and disappeared quickly.

Half a day later, I recovered and felt a big swelling on the back of my head. I went back to the room silently to apply medicine to myself and tried my best to endure not crying.

I had stayed by my daughter's bed, staring at her sleeping face in the darkening sky, until a burst of laughter came from the yard.

""David, fortunately you arrived in time and rescued me from the broken elevator. Otherwise, the baby might have miscarried.""

Through the window, I saw David holding Jessica's hand and holding Jessica's adopted son with his other strong arm.

He kissed her forehead like kissing his favorite little girl.

""With me protecting you and your son, you never have to be afraid.""

I noticed that the boy, who was about the same age as Charlotte, had a pair of emerald green eyes that were almost the same as Jessica's. He was wearing a well-made tailored clothes, from head to toe, all of them were luxury brands.

My daughter had grown up so big, but she had never worn any luxury goods, just because David always said that he didn’t want others to think we were extravagant.

Jessica's voice came again, ""Do you really want us to move in? What if Catherine is angry? I don’t want to destroy your relationship.""

David paused, his eyes moved slightly and then he said, ""She had no right to say no! As long as I was here, this was your home with the children.""

I grabbed my clothes tightly, laughed at myself and retracted my gaze.

Soon, the familiar footsteps came upstairs. David walked into the house and threw a green skirt into my hand.

""This was for Charlotte. Didn’t she like green the most?""

But my daughter liked blue and hated green the most. He hadn’t understood it at all after seven years. I stared at the skirt without saying anything. David’s face showed a trace of confusion and then he seemed to understand something.

He hugged me from behind and kissed my hair gently.

""I knew I had neglected you and our daughter during this period. I would make it up to you.""

""Jessica had just returned to the UK and had no place to live. I would take her and Gregory over and let them live in our house for a while.""

As my arms tightened, a strong perfume smell came from his body, which made me want to vomit. I pushed him away and smiled coldly.

""Whatever, let whoever you love live.""

My coldness made David frown unhappily and suddenly, a unique ringtone came from his waist.

He immediately loosened his arms around me and answered the phone.

""I had work.""

He turned around, with an irrepressible smile on his face and walked out quickly.

Half an hour later, I received a message from David on my phone.

""Bring me a box of stomach medicine to Yates Club.""

Knowing that he had stomach problems, I didn’t doubt him. When I rushed to the familiar door of the box, I saw through the crack in the door at first glance that in the dim space, Jessica was sitting on David's lap and the two of them were intimately entangled like an inseparable vine.

Several of David's buddies were there.

Suddenly someone asked, ""Now Jessica is back with you and she is pregnant with your child. What if Catherine finds out?""

David frowned slightly and then I heard him sneer.

""She had been like a dog to me since high school. She couldn’t even be forced to leave. So what if she knew?""

Chapter 3

A burst of laughter almost overturned the roof.

Only one man stared at Jessica on David's legs and asked disdainfully, ""Catherine had devoted a full ten years to you. You treated her like this for the woman who had abandoned you in the past. It was too heartless, wasn’t it?""

The next second, the man was hit hard in the face by David.

""I didn’t allow anyone to say that about Jessica! She had been forced to do it in the past. Her parents had married her to someone else, but she never consummated the marriage with that incompetent old man!""

Back then, David had no say in the Yates Family. He had had an elder brother with outstanding abilities. He had thought Jessica left because of jealousy.

But he hadn’t known that it was when Jessica found out that he was not the first heir of the Yates Family that she had left him without hesitation and went abroad.

After I had married David, in order to help him, I had accompanied clients to discuss business and drank so much that my stomach was perforated. I had attended every important meeting with a high fever and negotiated countless big deals.

I had even worked overtime for several weeks while pregnant, just to let him attend the international industry summit with a presentation ...

Over time, his parents had finally favored him. Ten years later, when he had finally taken control of the Yates Corporation business empire, she came back. And I was still just a bootlicker who came and went at his call, a complete joke in his eyes.

I felt a sharp pain in my chest and I instinctively hid in the corridor next to me. In order to protect Jessica, David had abandoned his usual calmness and his furious look with red eyes made everyone in the box dare not breathe.

Then, he picked up Jessica, who was crying in grievance and just as he reached the door, he stopped.

""None of you were allowed to say a word in front of Catherine!""

His voice was cold and firm as he said, ""You must not let her know that the child in Jessica's belly was mine.""

Then, he had hugged his crying mistress and left.

But where he couldn’t see, Jessica had cast a smug and arrogant look at me. I finally understood that the text message had been sent to me by Jessica on his phone so that I could see it all. I had walked on the street in a daze for a long, long time.

When I got home, I was stopped by Jessica in the corridor.

""Did you know? Every year on my birthday, he flew to accompany me just to give me a gift. Last year it was a Chanel necklace and the year before it was the latest limited edition Patek Philippe watch …""

""Those were all the styles I mentioned on social platforms that I liked and he actually remembered them all the time.""

""But I had deliberately gotten angry with him and thrown those gifts to him directly. In the end, I could get something more valuable than them. This man’s hot, vigorous, sexy body and his heart that was always in love with me and couldn’t stop.""

My fingers suddenly tightened and my nails sank deeply into my palm.

I remembered clearly that on those days every year, David had said he was going on a business trip abroad even though I didn’t see any arrangements on his work schedule.

Last year, he had brought a Chanel necklace. The year before, an expensive Patek Philippe watch …

I had been so happy that I put them all in my cabinet and couldn’t bear to wear them. But it turned out that he gave them to me after Jessica didn’t want them anymore.

Jessica continued to hurt my eardrums, ""Also, eight years ago on Christmas, I had a big fight with my then-husband and he actually flew over overnight and stayed outside my house in the snow for a whole night.""

I remembered that Christmas Eve. David had asked me for sex many times, contrary to his usual behavior and I had thought he finally started to fall in love with me.

When I woke up the next day, the pillow had already been cold and he had said he was on an urgent business trip and I hadn’t doubted it at all. It was also on that night that we had a daughter …

Now, I finally knew that David had forgotten to give me the contraceptive pill that day, just because he had been in a hurry to see Jessica?!

Chapter 4

Jessica raised a thick stack of letters in her hand,

""Over the years, I had deliberately not contacted him. But he had never forgotten me for a day and wrote me love letters every day, even though I never replied.""

I felt breathless. How many late nights had I seen him writing in the study, thinking he was handling official business, so I made coffee for him and sent it in.

It turned out that he had been telling Jessica his heart. It turned out that from beginning to end, the heart I had thought was finally warmed up had never had me. I couldn’t listen anymore and suddenly wanted to shake her off and turn away.

But Jessica grabbed my wrist and a gleam of light flashed across her face.

""Catherine, what did you have to fight me?""

After saying that, she grabbed my hand and pushed it to her shoulder. Then, she screamed and fell to the ground. I looked at everything in front of me in shock and before I could react, my shoulder was hit hard by someone.

It was David. He rushed over and picked up Jessica, his eyes full of pity. ""Jessica, are you okay?!""

Jessica buried her head in his shoulder sadly and cried aggrievedly, ""I just wanted to explain to Catherine that there was nothing wrong between you and me, but she called me a shameless bitch and said she wanted to kill me.""

Instantly, David yelled at me with red eyes, ""Are you crazy? Jessica was pregnant! Why are you so vicious?""

""I didn’t … ""

""Enough!"" David interrupted my explanation.

""If anything happens to Jessica and her child, I will make you pay!""

After saying that, he ignored my lips that were difficult to open, hugged Jessica and ran out, shouting to the bodyguard, ""Go to the hospital immediately!""

After a long time, I wiped away the tears of disappointment, slowly crawled upstairs and walked towards the bedroom. I began to pack my luggage silently, just waiting for the divorce agreement to take effect. Until the phone rang.

It was David who called me, ""Come to Yates Hospital immediately.""

I hurried to the hospital and saw David standing in the corridor from a distance and Jessica leaned on his arms, crying. My head suddenly shook and I felt dizzy. Now, they didn’t even pretend.

I walked over and moved my eyes away from David’s big hand holding Jessica’s shoulders with difficulty.

""David, what’s wrong?""

""Gregory suddenly suffered from renal failure and needed a kidney donation immediately.""

I was stunned for a moment.

""So?""

""There was no suitable kidney source now,"" David said lightly. ""I did a matching test and the result was a match.""

My heart was suddenly tightened by someone and I looked at him in disbelief.

""You wanted to donate a kidney to him?! But this would have a lifelong impact on your body …""

""I called you here just to inform you that the operation required family members to sign.""

I looked at him straight. Yes, now his wife was still me. But in his heart, his family members had always been the people he was holding in his arms now.

I bit my lips tightly to prevent others from seeing my red eyes.

""I’ll sign.""

When I wrote my name, every stroke seemed to make my heart bleed.

David changed into a surgical gown and lay on the operating cart. I watched him being wheeled away from a distance and finally couldn’t help shouting to him, ""David, the operation went well!""

He raised his head, his eyes moved slightly, but he just nodded.

When he disappeared in the operating room, my tears finally fell. Although I didn’t want to admit it, David’s love for Jessica was so deep that he could risk his future half of his life. I walked out of the hospital in a daze and took a taxi back home.

David didn’t come back that night and he didn’t come back for many days. But every day I could see David’s recent situation from Jessica’s circle of friends.

The operation was successful, but he ignored his wounds and was busy arranging the best ward for Jessica’s adopted son and even transferred top medical teams from all over the world, just for Gregory to recover soon.

For so many years, he had never been so considerate and thorough to his daughter. Even when his daughter had chickenpox and kept asking for her dad, he still hung up the phone and worked overtime in the brightly lit office. In the end, he just asked his assistant to send a toy to his daughter.

Jessica’s latest circle of friends was a photo posted in the morning. \[I would never meet a man who loved us mother and son so much again.\]

David leaned against the head of the bed, kissing her belly devoutly while receiving an IV and his handsome face showed a cherishing look that I had never seen before. My heart ached fiercely and tears fell on the screen of the mobile phone, blurring David’s gentle profile.

Chapter 5

""Mum, was Dad on a business trip again?""

Suddenly, my daughter's voice at the door called me back to my senses.

I woke up at once. Told myself it didn’t matter. Although he didn’t love us, I would love my daughter and myself twice as much.

I opened my arms and hugged her as I answered, ""Yes, baby, he was very busy at work.""

A trace of sadness flashed across my daughter's eyes and she suddenly raised her little face and asked me, ""Mum, were you leaving Dad?""

I was stunned. In fact, I had been so afraid that Charlotte would be hurt that I hadn’t figured out how to tell her about this yet.

I asked in a panic, ""How did you know, baby?""

""That day, I heard you talking to a lawyer on the phone.""

My daughter lay on my legs tightly, as if she were afraid of being abandoned by me, ""Mom, I love you and I always want to stay with you forever.""

Tears fell and I kept kissing her cute little face, ""Of course, Mom would always love you.""

After dinner, I packed Charlotte's luggage and coaxed my daughter to sleep. Suddenly, familiar footsteps came from downstairs, which seemed particularly hurried. Soon, David's face appeared at the door. He rushed in with a chill all over his body and grabbed my arm.

""Hurry up and let Jessica go! Just because I let her move in and I donated bone marrow to her adopted son, you kidnapped her?!""

David gritted his teeth, as if he wanted to bite me to pieces.

My arm seemed to be broken and I was in so much pain that I could not see anything, ""I did not kidnap her!""

Ignoring my excuses and pleas, David dragged me to an amusement park and tied me to the bungee jumping machine that I was most afraid of. Soon, I was in the air and the air under my feet made my eyes black and my heart almost stop beating.

He stood below, staring at me with a more ferocious look than a beast, ""Tell me now and I will let you down, Catherine.""

""David, I really didn’t know where Jessica went! Please, don’t do this to me!""

But he didn’t believe me. On the contrary, he looked cold,

""This was your last chance, Catherine.""

David had known that I was afraid of heights and that I didn’t dare to sit by the window even though it was just an office on the fifth floor. Now, he was going to use the method that I was most afraid of, regardless of my fear, just for his first love and their child.

I was weak all over as I told him, ""I swear, I really didn’t know anything! I was scared, David!""

The next second, he turned around and made a gesture to the staff. Then, I felt a feeling of falling that was more terrible than hell. The moment I fell from the sky at high speed, the overwhelming darkness came and the appearance of this man finally became completely blurred and distorted.

Even if he didn’t love me, but I had never thought that he would treat me so coldly and cruelly.

Ten years of love was ultimately misplaced.

Chapter 6

The smell of disinfectant pierced my nose and before my consciousness was completely restored, a man's low sigh came into my ears.

""You had been in a coma for two days.""

It was David. He sat on a chair beside the bed, working on his mobile phone. Sensing my movement, a soft thing passed through his deep eyes.

David put down his mobile phone, picked up the steaming soup on the bedside table, scooped a spoonful and handed it to my lips. But I subconsciously closed my lips and even slightly turned my head away.

The softness instantly shattered, replaced by a diffuse coldness.

He tightened his fingers around the spoon handle and his voice sank, ""Were you still making trouble? Catherine, I had taught you this lesson because you’d gone too far! You even taught my daughter to slander Jessica. I had been tolerant enough of you, don’t be ungrateful.""

I stared at this face that had been filled with all my youth and love and the corners of my mouth pulled out an arc that I didn’t know whether it was mockery or self-mockery, ""Yes, it was me who was vicious and jealous and I was deliberately trying to harm her! Are you satisfied with this answer?""

My eyes were uncontrollably sour, but I held back and didn’t let a single tear fall.

David looked at my red eyes and felt an inexplicable stab in his heart. He remembered that many years ago, when I had a high fever and curled up in his arms, I also looked at him with red eyes like this. At that time, the look in my eyes had been an inseparable dependence and admiration.

But at this moment, there was only desolation left.

A trace of guilt flashed through his eyes, but it was soon swallowed by the evil fire of disobedience.

""Catherine!"" he raised his voice, eager to prove his correctness.

""Did you know that Jessica had nightmares every night after I rescued her? It was obviously you who caused her … why were you pretending to be a victim here?!""

It was useless to defend myself and it only added to the humiliation. I turned my head silently and looked at the sky outside the window. My disregard angered him and he was about to explode when his cell phone rang.

David quickly turned sideways, but I still saw the screen. Jessica was wearing almost transparent lace underwear, lying seductively on the big bed in the hotel. I didn’t know what was said on the other end, but David’s breathing became rapid.

And the corners of his mouth even raised an arc uncontrollably. He stood up suddenly and said, ""I would pick you up when you were discharged from the hospital. When the time came, apologize to Jessica. She was soft-hearted. As long as you were sincere, she would forgive you.""

Before he finished speaking, his tall figure had disappeared at the door of the ward.

The next day I was discharged from the hospital, but only the driver came to pick me up.

David called, ""Today was Gregory’s birthday. He had suffered in an orphanage since he was a child. I was going to go to the amusement park with Jessica.""

He seemed to remember something and added in a gentle tone of pitiness, ""Don’t worry, I would bring gifts back for you and my daughter.""

The time on the phone reminded me that today was also Charlotte’s birthday.

At the same time, it was the date when the divorce certificate between him and me took effect. Of course, he hadn’t remembered it. I hung up the phone silently, sent the driver away and went to get the divorce decree alone.

My fingertips stroked the two cold jet-black words of ‘divorce’, but my heart was calm without a ripple, as if it were just an insignificant document. When I returned to the villa, I found that David and his friends had not left the house yet.

""Where did you go? The driver said you didn’t let him pick you up.""

He stood in the middle of the living room, looking at me in a straight suit.

Jessica, wearing an exquisite dress, held the equally well-dressed Gregory, leaning against him like a little bird.

I opened my mouth, but before I could say anything, he suddenly raised his eyebrows and said, ""Today was our wedding anniversary. Did you go out to prepare a gift?""

Chapter 7

I was slightly startled and then suddenly realized. Today was indeed also our wedding anniversary. Every year in the past, this day had been the day I spent all my effort to prepare a gift for David even if he never took it to heart.

This year, why had he suddenly ‘remembered’ it?

Did David remember that today was the day when the ten-year contract came to an end and we legally terminated our relationship?

My thoughts were surging and in the end, I just clenched the judgment on my chest and nodded lightly, ""Yes, I went to the mall.""

A trace of satisfaction flashed across his eyes and the corners of his lips curled slightly, ""Well, then I’d take Jessica and Gregory out first. When I came back in the evening, I’d accompany you ... to celebrate.""

""Well.""

My voice was cold.

The butler reminded David carefully, ""The amusement park had been booked as you ordered. Miss Charlotte had been talking about wanting to play the carousel. Did you want to … ""

David hesitated for a moment, then looked at me, ""Then you go and call Charlotte … ""

Before he finished speaking, Jessica trembled suddenly, grabbed his arm tightly, tears in her eyes and trembled in fear, ""David, I was afraid … what if Catherine did something more terrible to me and Gregory in the amusement park?""

David's body stiffened and he hugged her tightly, ""Okay, don’t take them. Let’s go.""

He didn’t look at me again, hugged her with one hand and held her son with the other hand and walked toward the garage.

My heart was calm and I turned and went upstairs. My daughter was standing on the terrace on the second floor, looking at the black Rolls-Royce carrying her father and other children out of the door.

I felt a sharp pain in my heart and I squatted down in front of her to explain to her, ""Dad had something urgent to do, so—""

""It’s okay, Mum!""

But my daughter interrupted me and smiled sweetly at me sensibly, ""I didn’t need Dad, it was enough to have Mum to celebrate my birthday with me!""

My eyes were warm as I said, ""Okay, Mom would make the baby the happiest little birthday star!""

I put on my daughter’s favorite princess dress and took her to my favorite Italian restaurant for a big meal. After lunch, both Charlotte and I went to visit the Museum Victoria and Albert that we both liked.

As night fell, I posted my daughter’s happy little face making a wish on the cake on Instagram.

\[Happy seventh birthday to my little princess!\]

Not long after I posted it, my phone vibrated wildly.

David’s voice was panic and condemnation, ""Why didn’t you remind me that today was my daughter’s birthday?""

Was it necessary?

When my daughter was looking forward to her parents accompanying her to blow out birthday candles and open gifts, her father was spending millions to set off grand fireworks for someone else’s son in the amusement park.

The drones formed a huge confession, shining over the city.

\[Jessica, the girl I love my whole life.\]

Under the bright fireworks, he kissed Jessica passionately.

This scene was captured and broadcast live by countless cameras and instantly swept the hot searches on major platforms around the world.

\#DavidYatesShowsLoveWithMillionsofFireworks

I calmly retracted my gaze from the TV screen and my voice was as cold as ice, ""David, Charlotte was your biological daughter, but did you need me to remind you of her birthday?""

This time, I hung up the phone without waiting for his answer.

""Beep … ""

A mechanical busy tone came from my ears. I didn’t know why, but David’s heart was hit by that inexplicable panic again. I put the divorce decree in the drawer that David often used and wiped off the fingerprints of the password lock for myself and my daughter.

In the living room, those expensive gifts that he had thrown at random. Jewelry, bags, artworks ... I swept them into the trash can expressionlessly. Then, I held my daughter’s hand, dragged the luggage and got into a car waiting on the roadside.

The car started and I took off the ring on my ring finger and threw it out of the car window. Passing an intersection, a black Rolls-Royce passed by us and drove in the opposite direction ...

Picture this- you're constantly thinking about food. Maybe it's a nagging hunger that just won't quit, or those relentless cravings for something sweet, salty, or super indulgent. We've all been there, right? For years, my relationship with food felt like a never-ending battle. Then, Semaglutide entered the chat, and let me tell you, it completely rewrote the rules of engagement with my appetite.

It's one thing to hear that Semaglutide reduces hunger, but it's another thing entirely to *experience* it. And the craving changes? That's a whole other ball game. If you're on Semaglutide, or thinking about it, you might be wondering what it's really like when your hunger quietens down and those old cravings start to vanish. Here's my honest take on navigating this new, fascinating landscape.

**The Quiet Revolution: What Hunger Feels Like Now**

One of the first things you'll notice on Semaglutide is that the constant buzz of hunger starts to fade. It's not like you never feel hungry again- that's a myth. Instead, it's a much more subtle, manageable sensation.

In my experience, hunger now feels:
- **Less urgent:** Before, hunger felt like an emergency alarm going off in my stomach. Now, it's more like a gentle reminder.
- **Easier to ignore:** I can go hours without thinking about food, which was simply unthinkable before.
- **Different:** It's often a quiet rumble, not a gnawing emptiness. Sometimes it's just a general feeling of needing fuel, rather than a specific craving.

This shift is actually pretty cool, but it also means you have to learn to listen to your body in a new way. You might find yourself forgetting to eat, or just not feeling the urge to grab a snack ""just because.""

**Cravings - Gone or Just Different?**

This is where it gets really interesting, at least for me. My cravings didn't just disappear overnight- they evolved. And some of them, well, they truly did vanish.

**The Vanishing Act: What I Stopped Craving**

It's almost surreal to think about how much my taste buds have changed. Foods I used to obsess over now hold very little appeal.

Here are some common culprits that lost their magic for me:
- **Sugary drinks:** Sodas, sweet teas, even fancy coffee drinks. They just taste overly sweet and unappealing now.
- **Fast food:** The greasy, heavy feeling after eating it just isn't worth it. The smell alone can sometimes be a deterrent.
- **Ultra-processed snacks:** Chips, cookies, candy bars- they don't call to me anymore. The texture or artificial taste often feels off.
- **Large portions:** That feeling of needing to ""clean my plate"" is gone. I get full much faster.

This isn't to say I never have a treat, but the intense, uncontrollable desire for these things is largely gone. It's freeing, honestly.

**The Subtle Shift: What I Still Enjoy (in Moderation)**

Some cravings don't vanish entirely, but they definitely change. You might find yourself enjoying old favorites, but in much smaller quantities or with less frequency.

For me, this includes:
- **Chocolate:** A small piece of dark chocolate is satisfying, whereas before I'd want the whole bar.
- **Comfort foods:** Things like pasta or pizza are still enjoyable, but a few bites are often enough. The desire to overeat them is gone.
- **Salty snacks:** Sometimes I still want something savory, but a small handful of nuts or a few crackers do the trick.

It's about finding that new balance and recognizing that a little goes a long way.

**Navigating the New Normal: Strategies for Eating**

So, your hunger is quieter, and your cravings are different. What now? This is where you get to build new, healthier habits. It's not just about what you *don't* want, but what you *do* choose to eat.

**Listen to Your Body's New Signals**

This is probably the most important tip. Your body is talking to you differently now.
- **Eat when you're truly hungry:** Not just because it's ""mealtime"" or because others are eating.
- **Stop when you're satisfied, not stuffed:** That feeling of uncomfortable fullness is a thing of the past. Embrace feeling comfortably full.
- **Hydrate first:** Sometimes what feels like hunger is actually thirst. Try a glass of water and wait a few minutes.

**Prioritize Nutrient-Dense Foods**

Since you're eating less, every bite counts more. Make sure those bites are packed with goodness.
- **Focus on protein:** This is key for satiety and muscle maintenance. Think lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant-based proteins.
- **Load up on fiber:** Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains help you feel full and support digestion.
- **Include healthy fats:** Avocados, nuts, seeds- they contribute to satisfaction and overall health.

**Plan Your Meals (Even if You Don't Feel Like It)**

It might sound counterintuitive when you're not hungry, but planning helps ensure you get enough nutrition.
- **Prep easy options:** Have pre-cut veggies, cooked chicken, or hard-boiled eggs ready to go.
- **Schedule loose meal times:** Even if you just aim for three main opportunities to eat, it helps.
- **Don't skip meals entirely:** Even if you're not ravenous, a small, balanced meal is important for energy and nutrient intake.

**Beyond the Plate: Emotional & Social Shifts**

Coping with less hunger and changing cravings isn't just about what's on your plate- it impacts your whole life. You might notice some interesting emotional and social changes too.

**Emotional Freedom from Food**

For many of us, food was tied to emotions- comfort, stress relief, reward. When the intense pull of food lessens, it can be incredibly liberating.
- **Less food noise:** That constant chatter about what to eat next, when to eat, or what you ""shouldn't"" eat really quietens down.
- **Reduced guilt:** The cycle of craving, giving in, and then feeling guilty often breaks.
- **Finding new coping mechanisms:** You might start leaning into hobbies, exercise, or connecting with friends instead of turning to food.

It's a chance to build a healthier emotional relationship with yourself, separate from eating.

**Navigating Social Situations**

Eating is a huge part of our social lives, and this can be an adjustment.
- **Restaurant outings:** You might order less, take home leftovers, or opt for lighter choices. Don't feel pressured to keep up with others.
- **Family gatherings:** People might comment on your smaller plate. A simple ""I'm just not as hungry these days"" usually suffices.
- **Food as a social glue:** Find other ways to connect with friends and family that don't revolve solely around eating. Maybe it's a walk, a movie, or a game night.

It takes a little practice, but you'll find your rhythm. Remember, your journey is unique, and it's okay to set new boundaries around food in social settings.

The shift in hunger and cravings on Semaglutide is profound, and it offers an incredible opportunity to redefine your relationship with food. It's not just about weight loss- it's about gaining control, understanding your body's new signals, and building a sustainable, healthier lifestyle. Embrace the change, listen to your body, and enjoy the newfound freedom that comes with a quieter appetite.",1,1752782483.0,SemaglutideGuide,0,1.0,False
1m2hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1m2hole/i_might_have_a_problem/,I might have a problem…,"26M. I recently had a blood test and found that my total testosterone level exceeded 1000 ng/dL, which raised some concerns. My levels have typically been on the higher side (most recently 740 ng/dL in May 2024), but this spike feels abnormal.

Over the past three months, I’ve been very sexually active (3–4 times per week) and masturbating frequently—around twice daily—mostly as a way to cope with stress. Recently, I’ve started experiencing difficulty ejaculating after sex, which is a new and noticeable change.

My diet is relatively clean: primarily poultry, occasional salads/greens (like cucumbers and spinach), and daily coffee. I practice intermittent fasting and don’t take any supplements besides omega-3. However, I’ve realized I’ve likely been underhydrated. I’ve also been dealing with frequent mood swings and possible insomnia, likely tied to stress and disrupted sleep patterns.

I’ve reviewed the results with my doctor. An MRI is scheduled, and I’ll be seeing an endocrinologist soon. Hoping for clear answers and nothing unexpected.

1m2hoie,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1m2hoie/attempted_to_boil_down_peating_for_an_interested/,"Attempted to boil down peating for an interested friend, how’d I do with this summary?","Ray Peat’s core theories rest on the idea that health and disease are governed by the body’s ability to produce and use energy efficiently, primarily through oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria. Bioenergetics. He believed that when the body favors sugar metabolism over fat oxidation, particularly glucose in the presence of thyroid hormone (T3) and sufficient CO₂, it supports robust function, tissue regeneration, also emotional stability. Peat viewed oxygen, sugar, thyroid hormone, carbon dioxide, and light as primary life-supporting forces. And anything that shifts metabolism toward inefficient energy use such as polyunsaturated fats particularly linoleic acid (main or major component of many seed and nut oils such as soy and canola and peanut), excess estrogen, serotonin, nitric oxide (iirc Peat viewed even the endothelial nitric oxide synthas/ eNOS enzyme as problematic), and hypoxia, he considered inherently pathological.

Peat hypothesized many modern diseases from cancer to depression to hypothyroidism are consequences of metabolic suppression, chronic stress responses, and inappropriate hormonal signaling. Strongly rejects the widespread medical use of antidepressants, estrogen therapies, and PUFA-rich diets, argues that these interventions amplify biological stress and suppress mitochondrial respiration. He proposed that serotonin, long considered a “happiness chemical,” is actually a stress transmitter, elevated during learned helplessness, inflammation, and tissue damage. he viewed estrogens, or at least excess estrogens (maybe he was referring to one estrogen in particular like estradiol/E2) not as a feminizing or essential hormones, but as a pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive stress compound that builds up under liver dysfunction and metabolic inefficiency.

The recommendations center around supporting metabolism with easily-digestible sugars (eg fruit and honey, particularly orange), saturated fats, gelatin, thyroid hormone T3 (if needed), adequate calcium, and red light exposure. He emphasized the protective role of CO₂ and progesterone (in men too), both of which reduce oxidative stress and stabilize cell function. His work highlighted the damage caused by iron excess, radiation, environmental toxins, and iirc unsupportive social environments. Tbh often dismissed as fringe. However, Peat’s ideas are grounded in a deep synthesis of endocrinology, physiology, biochemistry, and 20th-century experimental biology. He’s rally just radically in favor of harnessing the organism’s inherent regenerative potentials, and perhaps radical only because the last several decades of nutrition and dietetics research (in US & North America at least) has been such a nasty cesspool of interested parties duplicity massaging and sometimes outright fabricating data, for example when even very carefully designed experimental frameworks lead to results that bely negative effects of linoleic acid, haha sorry to digress. 

Peat nutritional framework: vitamin and mineral requirements are oriented around maximizing metabolic rate, supporting thyroid function, and counteracting stress mediators. While exact dosages vary based on individual context, some common targets include 5,000–10,000 IU of vitamin A (from liver or egg yolks) to support thyroid sensitivity and steroid synthesis, 1,000–2,000 mg of calcium (from dairy, not supplements) to balance phosphate and suppress parathyroid hormone, and 400–800 mg of magnesium, ideally from food or well-absorbed forms like glycinate or bicarbonate, to support ATP stability and calm the nervous system. Potassium should be at least 3,000–5,000 mg to aid glucose metabolism, sodium should be liberally included to sustain adrenal resilience and avoid aldosterone-driven stress physiology. Trace elements like zinc (15–30 mg) and copper (1–2 mg) must be balanced to preserve thyroid hormone conversion and dopamine stability, emphasis on bioavailable forms from shellfish, eggs, or liver.

In terms of macronutrient ratios, Peat advocated a diet that skews carbohydrate-dominant, something like 45–60% carbs, 20–35% fat, and 15–20% protein, & he emphasized context over strict numbers. Carbohydrates particularly from ripe fruit, honey, orange juice, and root vegetables  are the preferred energy source for maintaining high metabolic output and minimizing cortisol and adrenaline. Protein intake should prioritize gelatin, dairy, eggs, and shellfish, keep muscle meats lower to reduce excess tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine, which can promote serotonin and oxidative stress. Fats should come mainly from saturated sources like dairy and coconut oil with strict avoidance of PUFAs, which he considered antimetabolic due to their tendency to promote lipid peroxidation, suppress thyroid function, and accumulate in tissues. More controversially, this includes EPA and DHA, two popularly lauded and well-researched omega 3 fatty acids.

Among the most essential “Peaty” foods are ripe fruits (especially oranges and tropical varieties) for sugar, potassium, and flavonoids; milk and cheese for calcium, protein, and fat-soluble vitamins; coffee with sugar and cream to stimulate metabolism and liver detoxification; bone broth or gelatin to balance the amino acid profile of muscle meats; coconut oil for antifungal, pro-thyroid effects; liver (once weekly) for vitamin A, copper, and B vitamins; eggs for choline and saturated fat; and shellfish for highly bioavailable zinc and selenium without iron overload. Salt is liberally used to stabilize blood pressure and adrenal tone, and red light or sunlight exposure is considered nearly as important as food. Oh carrots too, raw carrots maybe with vinegar and coconut oil, contains non-fermentable fiber Peat rally liked for iirc gut health and microbiome management. Fundamentally it is about selecting foods that reinforce the body’s energetic competence, hormonal balance, and resistance to chronic stress signaling",3,1752782440.0,raypeat,2,1.0,False

We ran in to a spot of bad luck and a wonderful family let us stay in their home for the day. They wanted nothing from us and we're honestly so kind and down to earth. (Actually most of the people we have met are so friendly, it's refreshing).

As a thank you, I would love to send them a gift basket filled with goodies (teas, biscuits, coffee etc).

Any recommendations for where I could order online!  I've googled and there are stacks of companies, i'd really like one that isrecommended though and I'd love to support local if I could. I know sometimes the best ones don't appear on the first few pages of Google.

I'm trying to come up with a coffee cocktail. The issue I'm running into is it feels like they should have cream or some sort of milk. Won't that curdle if it's sitting in a batch all night? Any creamy drinks I've ever made were served immediately. What are some smart cream alternatives? I have requests for coffee cocktails semi regularly. 

The venue owners are pretty picky about certain things like:

-They don't want super strong drinks, so there needs to be more mixer than alcohol. 

- They will not buy liqueurs as they don't want to keep the extra inventory.

- They will only serve a more complex cocktail, or cocktail that needs extra ingredients(outside of what the venue has) if it's prebatched.

This translates to no kahlua, no Irish cream, and the bartenders will pour at most two things into a drink. (Event bartend..) 

I'm thinking cold brew as the main base, and a liquor, but I would like to make it a little bit nicer.

There’s a girl in my workplace that I really fancy, we’ve had a few minutes of small talk here and there and the vibe was always good. Yesterday, I asked her out for coffee next weekend (I’m on holiday this weekend) and she seemed excited about it. I understand work can be a risky place for stuff like. I didn’t want her to feel pressured or uncomfortable, so I deliberately asked if she wanted my number, instead of me asking for hers. My thinking here was basically giving her an easy bail out card, if she secretly weren’t interested then she could just not text me and that’d be that. (Side note - our work place is huge, we can very easily go a whole week without seeing one another, so the chances of us crossing paths and it being all awkward is pretty low).

She text me not long after, and I responded later on. I didn’t get a response from her for about 12 hours, but she had to stay late in work so all good, also her response was a positive one, it didn’t seem like a half assed response. I last text her 24hrs ago and I still haven’t had a response.  

It’s cool if she’s not in to me, but it’d just be nice to know. What should I do? Do I give her a follow up text tomorrow and say something like “hey are you still up for going out tomorrow? It’s absolutely fine if not, I just want to plan my weekend :)” OR do I just take the hint, not follow up, and move on?",0,1752782158.0,dating,4,0.5,False

My name is Steve. I'm a developer, but for the past year, I've also been a host, renting out a small apartment I own. 

I love hosting, but I'm sure you all know the feeling... the constant, repetitive questions from guests, often at the most inconvenient times.

""What's the Wi-Fi password?"" (even though it's on the router, in the welcome book, and in the Airbnb message thread).
""How does the coffee machine work?""
""Where's the nearest grocery store?""
""Can I check out 3 hours late?""

It felt like I was spending more time as a 24/7 support line than actually managing my property. The mental load was getting to be too much.

Since I'm a developer, I decided to build a solution for myself. I created a simple platform where I could dump all the information about my apartment—check-in instructions, appliance manuals, house rules, local recommendations, you name it. Then, the platform generates a unique link that I share with my guests when they book.

Here's the cool part: when guests click the link, they get a simple chat window with an AI-powered assistant. They can ask it anything, and it instantly provides answers based on the info I uploaded.
The result? It's been a game-changer for me. My late-night and early-morning interruptions have dropped by what feels like 80%. My guests seem happier because they get instant answers without having to wait for me to reply. My last few reviews have even specifically mentioned how easy and clear all the instructions were.

I was thinking this tool could be useful for other hosts too. I'd love to get some real-world feedback from the community.
Would any of you be interested in trying it out for your own listing, completely for free, in exchange for your honest opinion? I want to know what you think, what features are missing, and if it genuinely helps you as much as it has helped me.

Let me know in the comments or shoot me a DM if you're interested!

Recently, I decided to experiment with making noodles and ramen in my kettle, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.

First off, it's important to note that not all electric kettles are suitable for cooking noodles. Some are designed solely for boiling water and may not have the capacity or features needed for this task. However, if you have a kettle with a wide mouth and a decent capacity, you're in luck.

I started with a simple packet of instant ramen. I poured enough water into the kettle to cover the noodles, added the noodles and seasoning packet, and turned it on. In about 3-4 minutes, the water was boiling, and I let it sit for another minute or two. To my delight, the noodles were perfectly cooked and ready to eat.

For regular noodles, the process is similar. Just make sure to break them into smaller pieces if they're too long for your kettle. Add water, turn on the kettle, and wait until the noodles are soft. Drain the water carefully, and you're good to go.

One thing to keep in mind is that cooking noodles in your kettle might leave residue, so it's essential to clean it thoroughly afterward. I usually rinse it out with hot water and a bit of dish soap, then do a final rinse with clean water.

While this method works in a pinch, it's not ideal for everyday use. Electric kettles are primarily designed for boiling water, and using them frequently for cooking might shorten their lifespan. Plus, some kettles have exposed heating elements that could be damaged by noodles sticking to them.

If you find yourself often wanting to make quick meals like noodles or ramen, you might want to consider investing in a dedicated electric kettle that's designed for more versatile use. These kettles often have wider mouths, larger capacities, and features that make them suitable for cooking small meals.

I recently came across a great selection of electric kettles that could be perfect for this purpose. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have various options that might suit your needs, whether you're looking for something basic or a more advanced model with multiple temperature settings.

In conclusion, while it's possible to make noodles or ramen in an electric kettle, it's not the ideal method for regular use. It's a handy trick to know for emergencies or when you're short on cooking equipment, but for frequent noodle-making, you're better off using a pot on the stove or investing in a more versatile electric kettle.

Remember, whatever method you choose, always prioritize safety and follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific appliance. Happy cooking!",1,1752781950.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

And *nothing* makes sense here.

The girl was alone. The apartment was locked. Then, she was gone.

No forced entry. No struggle. No body.

Just a sealed apartment, and coffee still steaming in the dark.

The cops take off as soon as I arrive. They always do.

I don’t blame them.

They’re not equipped to deal with what lies inside.

But I am.

I cross the threshold. The door whispers shut behind me.

Hidden bolts slide into place. The edges glow green.

Secure lock.

Penthouse unit. A thousand stories high. Pristine. Expensive.

Designed to make rich people feel safe.

But I know better.

The air here tastes of copper and ozone.

It has *weight*.

Rain batters the full-length window at the far end —

discreet holographic displays flickering: Storm Warning: Persistent Cell — Duration: Indefinite.

Red neon pulses against the glass.

Crimson lightning arcs in the boiling storm clouds.

Police drones sweep past in tight formation.

I walk through the apartment.

My stiletto boots click on the black marble floor.

Half a sandwich on the table.

Her comms pad on the counter.

No disturbance. No blood.

Just emptiness.

I reach into my coat. Unbuckle the Lens from its brace.

The Asphodel Lens isn’t standard.

I built it myself.

Blackglass core. Pattern-binding etched by hand.

It doesn’t show the past. Not exactly.

It shows the places where reality’s been carved open.

When someone performs a ritual —

when they cut through —

Deeplight flows in.

It moves through the tear in a specific shape.

The pattern determines what happens.

The cuts scar over eventually.

But the residue lingers.

That’s what the Lens sees.

I power it up.

The hum is low. Just above silence.

The air shifts. The windows flicker.

Blue light spills across the walls in thin arcs.

And then I see it.

A scar in the floor. Just beneath the table.

The edges glow faintly — not with light, but with something deeper.

A cold, slow pulse.

Fresh.

Still bleeding.

I kneel. Scan the sigils.

The cuts are sharp. Intentional.

Clean burn lines where reality’s been split open and stitched back together.

But the pattern—

I don’t know it.

Not Old-World.

Not Chaosborn.

Not proto-Synoptic.

Not a distortion or inversion.

Just… unfamiliar.

I stare for a long time. Let the Lens hover. Let the scar speak.

The shape is precise. The energy is real.

But I can’t read it.

That *doesn’t happen*.

I know every invocation.

Every curse, every veiled structure, every drifted fragment

recovered from drowned archives or dead minds.

But I don’t know what *this* is.

I stand slowly.

And I feel it.

The pull.

A hum behind my thoughts.

A weight above me.

I look up.

And there it is.

Another scar.

Massive.

Spanning the ceiling.

Almost invisible unless you’re looking for it.

Etched glyphs.

Wound marks.

Burned logic that’s old — but not dead.

Faded like smoke that never left the room.

I zoom the Lens. Focus tight.

The cuts are wide.

Deeper than anything I’ve seen.

Too deep.

Too old.

The shape isn’t just complex —

it’s foreign.

The *power* it took to cut something like that…

I can’t calculate it.

The room is silent.

I shut the Lens down. The glow dies.

But the sense remains.

The ceiling still feels alive.

I step back. Close the case. Leave.

Outside, the city is still screaming.

Rain cuts sideways across neon glass.

Ads flicker in the puddles.

Traffic drones buzz the upper lanes.

My trench drips.

My boots leave trails on the glowing sidewalk.

I breathe slow.

Try to ground myself.

But something’s wrong.

That glyph on the floor —

it isn’t recorded anywhere.

Not even in the burned books.

And the ceiling scar —

It’s structural. It’s old.

I keep circling the same questions.

What kind of working needs *that much* Deeplight?

Who — or what — could even *handle* that much power?

1m2hbgt,https://i.redd.it/uk4byh7fnhdf1.png,Love After Heartbreak - My hands were both at noon on the steering wheel and I pressed my head to them while I sat at the red light.,"A strange text message on my phone caught my attention: Want to know what your man was doing while he was deployed? Or should I say \*who\* he was doing? Right after that, I received a video. Don't press play.......

Chapter 1

My hands were both at noon on the steering wheel and I pressed my head to them while I sat at the red light. Just for a second I allowed myself to let go of the breath I'd been holding for what felt like months. Four more hours to get home and then my fianc's plane would be landing three hours after that, bringing him home for the first time in a year.



And what a year it'd been.



His deployment had seemed endless, and so much had happened while Padon had been gone. Life had been difficult here, but I knew it'd been even worse for him where he was, a highly volatile area that seemed ready to ignite at any moment. Every time we talked, I could see the stress etched into his face, and the last four months, it'd only gotten worse.



Between the time difference and my crazy work schedule, even finding opportunities to talk had been a challenge, and the conversations we did manage were sometimes difficult as I held back what had been going on with me. Guilt, sadness and anger made me stilted, and I wondered if I'd made the right decision to wait until he was home to tell him everything. But every time I saw his exhausted, tense face, I knew I needed to hold off and not add anything to his burden over there.



He was my person, had been since the moment we met, and I wouldn't do anything to endanger him. Had he known, Padon would have been stressing about what I was going through, possibly shifting his focus when he needed every bit of it for the job. All I wanted was to be able to talk with him and not worry for his safety. Feel his arms around me as I poured out everything that had occurred. Lifting my head from my hands, I moved them to my belly, still feeling the emptiness, the loss Padon hadn't even known about, the despair when my body hadn't been able to hold on to our precious child. Padon wouldn't know about the baby until I could tell him face-to-face, along with all of the other things that had happened.



Padon was the first person in my life I was fully invested in and he'd become my best friend and lover -- and what an incredible combination that was. For the first time in my life, I understood what making love meant. He made everything deeper, more meaningful, more beautiful. he was my connection to the world.



If I was being honest, he was the only real friend I'd ever had. Although I'd had friendships, it was more one-sided. I'd learn about my friends, but I always had my barriers up and didn't share much about myself. In essence, I was their friend but they weren't really mine; until Padon, no one knew the whole me. But with him, I'd readily given him all of me, every bit of knowledge about me that there was and he'd taken it and protected it, handling it with care. He'd shared everything with me as well. He let me in, told me the ugliest things about himself and saw I accepted every part of him just as easily as he accepted every part of me.



Being without him had been unbearable, and then, about six weeks after he left for his deployment, I'd discovered that our last night together had not only resulted in us becoming engaged but had also created a baby. Suddenly, I didn't feel so lonely. I had Padon's baby growing inside me, and although the pregnancy had happened ahead of our schedule, this baby was a welcome surprise, loved from the first moment I suspected.



From the start, it'd been a difficult pregnancy, and I'd had a number of scares, which reinforced my decision not to tell him about the baby. He'd only worry about both of us and get frustrated he wasn't there to take care of us. And when I'd had a stillbirth at six months, I'd borne that loss and pain alone, knowing he would lose his mind that he hadn't -- couldn't -- be there for me. It had been the darkest point of my life, and that darkness cast a long shadow. The loss was still curled around my heart, squeezing it so tightly at times that I was sure it would stop beating from the pain, leaving me gasping and trying to breathe.



No, Padon didn't need to experience that while he was deployed; he could join me in mourning when he returned and his life wasn't on the line every moment. I couldn't bear it if anything happened to him, too, especially if I was the one who caused him to lose focus.



I'd used the excuse of my work to limit our conversations, and when we did talk, I knew I wasn't my normal self with him, though I'd tried. That was the problem with knowing someone so well. Padon knew something was off. When he asked me what was wrong a number of times, I just used work, exhaustion and missing him as an excuse. And slowly, after about two months of me being distant, he became more distant, and he'd claimed work was getting more intense. For the last four months of his deployment, things had been tense between us on the phone, but I knew we'd get everything ironed out when he returned home. When he was safe.



My phone chimed just as the light turned green, and I knew it wasn't my fianc because he was still in the air for at least seven more hours. Thinking it might be one of my customers, I pulled into the nearest parking lot and parked. It was an unknown number, and I opened the text, thinking it could be a potential client.



The message chilled me, causing me to suck in so much air I had a coughing fit.



We women need to have one another's back. Want to know what your man was doing while he was deployed? Or should I say \*who\* he was doing? I just wanted you to know.



Then another text followed, but there wasn't a message. Just a video. A video that would turn out to be worth a thousand disgusting words.



Don't press play. Don't press play. My heart was begging me not to do it, but my head had taken the wheel.



Pressing play, I saw a beautiful brunette smiling into her camera. A topless, pretty brunette whose surgically-enhanced breasts left mine in the dust if we were having a competition for perkiness and size.



""God you are so good at that, Padon.""



Hit pause! Hit pause! Wait until Padon gets home and ask him to explain.



I had to let it play, feeling like I was going to get sick. He wouldn't have. There was just no way he would have cheated on me.



The camera turned to a man, his face between the woman's legs. Maybe it was a different Padon, but his hair color was the same and...oh, God help me, I knew those strong hands that were clamped around her thighs, holding her in place because he was that good at what he was doing.



""Smile for the camera, baby. I've got a month here all by myself before I get to go home and I'm going to need a reminder of you and all the delicious things you've been doing to me.""



He lifted his head and any hopes I had that it really wasn't Padon died along with anything else inside me that had survived the loss of my baby. He wasn't smiling and he was irritated.



""Put the camera away, Kayla.""



He even sounded annoyed.



Fumbling for the door handle and my seat belt release, I opened the car door and launched myself out seconds before I threw up until I had nothing left to give. After rinsing my mouth with water, I got back in the car, shaking, crying, nose gooey and dripping.



Then, as if pressing play hadn't been enough of a mistake, I compounded it.



Chapter 2

Wiping my nose with the back of my hand, not even caring how gross it was, I texted back this mystery woman.



How long was this going on?



About four months



So he'd begun this after I'd lost our baby. The tears just kept coming, sobs bursting from deep within me, ripping and tearing through me like a chainsaw. Anyone passing by my car must have thought I had a wounded animal in here with all the howling and screaming erupting from me and they wouldn't have been wrong. I opened the car door again to get sick for the second time, barely able to keep from falling down on the ground I was shaking and shuddering so violently. All this time, all this time, I'd been worried about distracting him from his job and keeping him safe, while he was distracting himself by having an affair with no thought to me. I'd been suffering with the agony of losing our baby, trying to survive each day until he, my safe space, returned...and he'd been fucking another woman.



My mind was an absolute mess, and without thought, I proceeded to vomit again, only this time, it was word vomit as I texted back this stranger who had been decent enough to let me know what Padon was doing behind my back.



How could he do this to me? We just got engaged before he left for his deployment. He asked me to marry him! We bought a home together three months before that. We have a house and a mortgage! And I found out I was pregnant six weeks after he left and I didn't tell him because the pregnancy was rough and I didn't want to worry him. I didn't want him to lose his focus for one minute. Then I lost the baby at just six months and I didn't want to upset him because I knew he'd worry and he was in a dangerous place where his life was on the line. Why would he do this?



I hadn't thought things through very carefully. In my confusion and pain I'd poured all of that out to her. Did I say she'd been decent enough? I'd been very wrong about that.



Because in response to my oversharing text, she turned nasty, revealing her true self, and I could have kicked myself for my naivety in my moment of weakness and confusion. One after the other, her texts rolled in, each one finding a new insecurity of mine to exploit, each poison dart hitting the mark, her toxins spreading through me and paralyzing me with pain.



So, you failed to keep your baby alive. Like he needs a woman who can't even manage that simple task.



If you weren't so shitty in bed, he never would have turned to me. He needs me because I can give him what he wants in bed like you never could.



You have no idea what it takes to be with a military man of his caliber and keep him from finding someone better than you.



Face it. You're seven years older than he is which means he doesn't want your old ass any longer. Trading you in for the new, improved model. LOL



He'd told her about our age difference?



You don't do enough for him. You thought once you hooked him, you didn't need to put the work in, but, honey, you were so fucking wrong about that and now he's mine.



What on earth had he been telling her? I didn't do enough for him? I worked sixty hour weeks and my job required travel between four states. He'd never even hinted he wanted me to do things for him over and above what we already did for each other. And now he was telling her I didn't do enough?



He always laughed when I referred to you as the Fat, Ugly Bitch back home. After looking at your SM, I can see I wasn't wrong. Be prepared tonight when he asks to buy out your half of the house so I can move in when my deployment's over in a month. Bye bye, FUB.



For the third time, I was stumbling out of the car, but there wasn't anything left in me. I dry heaved so hard, I was sure my body was now trying to dispel my internal organs, and I had to brace myself on the hood of the car to stay upright. This...this vile creature was the reason he'd been so distant the last four months. I'd thought he'd just been horribly busy and stressed about work, or even responding to my distance, but no. He'd been cheating on me and making plans for a future with her in our home. No wonder he'd been distant.



Would these fucking tears ever stop? That just made me cry harder. I couldn't think, couldn't focus, couldn't do anything but choke on my tears.



I'd been working like a crazy woman on the house so Padon could come back to a home. After I'd lost our baby and recovered, I'd thrown myself into updating the house so I didn't have time to think about the baby and everything else that was going on. On the nights I wasn't out of state for work and on the weekends, I'd painted walls and cabinets, caulked, tiled the backsplashes, and had paid for laminate floors to be put in. I washed windows, hung light, breezy curtains and installed faux wooden blinds that I knew Padon preferred over Roman shades.



I started laughing hysterically when I realized my life had just been shredded and I was thinking about wooden blinds versus Roman shades. The laughing led to more tears and it took me a couple of hours to calm down so I wouldn't be a danger to anyone on the road. I still had four hours of driving ahead of me, a life to figure out and a murder to plan.



Well, not literally because felonies had a tendency to be forever. But it helped to envision revenge scenarios.



I needed to contact a lawyer to see how two unmarried people had to go about splitting up a house they jointly owned if one of them wanted to keep it. To see if I could prevent my former fianc from allowing the vile creature he'd cheated on me with from moving in until we'd figured out how to handle the house. To ask if the repairs and improvements I'd made were something that could be figured into the value of the house if he wanted to buy me out. To see if setting fire to the house could get me in trouble since it was half mine.



I wouldn't actually do that. Unless he was in it with her. Kidding. Kind of.



The dark humor was helping me get through the drive home. Halfway there, my phone started chiming, and I refused to look until I was back at the house because if she'd somehow gotten another number to call me from after I'd blocked her, I had no interest in whatever toxic shit she wanted to add to the hazmat pile she'd already dumped on me.



And if it was Padon, I was in no mood to talk with him yet. Fortunately, because of where he'd come from, there was a mandatory quarantine for the returning servicemen. That gave me a two week reprieve from having to see him, and I was thinking it would take that long to be able to speak to him without breaking down in tears. He may have broken me into little pieces, but I wouldn't let him see that.



He was the first person I'd allowed full access to my heart, and in the end, he hadn't cared. It hadn't mattered, I hadn't mattered, we hadn't mattered. His promises to me had turned out to be hollow words that crumbled into dust at the first opportunity.



I wouldn't forget this lesson. I wouldn't even bother trying to put all my broken pieces back together. I'd just erect barriers around them and no one would ever be let in again.



Chapter 3

I made it home well after dark. Once I parked in the garage and turned off the car, I threw my head back and sighed, exhausted, thinking of all there was to be faced. Picking up my phone that I'd turned off when even the vibrating had gotten annoying with text after text and call after call, I debated turning it back on. Ultimately, I decided against it. I wasn't ready to face anything, especially at this hour, and I was feeling sufficiently numb, which meant I might be able to grab a few hours of sleep. The night before in the hotel, I hadn't slept much because I was so excited that Padon would be coming home today.



Even if I couldn't see him because of the quarantine, at least he was back and physically closer, out of danger. Two weeks would fly and then I'd finally be in his arms, pressed to his chest, able to tell him everything. He'd hold me, cry with me over our tiny boy, and we'd help each other through it. I'd delayed much of my grief so we could share it when he returned. Then, I could fill him in on other things that were going on and everything would be out in the open.



Turning on the phone could wait until tomorrow. I'd dealt with enough horror today. I walked into the house, enjoying the fresh, lemony scent that meant I was home. For a while longer, at least. I had no desire to stay in the house, and if Padon wanted to buy me out, I'd let him. And hide rotting fish all over the house right before I moved out. That I might actually do since I was fairly certain it didn't constitute a felony.



I got a glass of water and walked to the master bedroom before detouring to the guest bedroom. I'd decorated this room with soft, muted florals, pale yellow walls and bright white furniture I'd bought for practically nothing at a thrift store and painted myself. Almost as if I'd known I'd eventually be sleeping in here.



A knock on my front door scared the hell out of me. It was eleven o'clock and this neighborhood shut down by no later than ten. Hurrying to the door, I checked the peephole and opened it to my neighbor on the right.



""Sasha, are you OK?""



""I was making sure you were,"" she said. Sasha was in her mid sixties and had been very welcoming when Padon and I had moved in.



That was odd.



""Padon's been calling me,"" she explained, ""and I've been stopping by every hour or so. He said you weren't answering your phone and he was worried.""



Hadn't the vile creature filled him in so he'd know why I wasn't answering? Maybe the huge time difference had prevented her from getting in touch.



""Oh, my phone must have died when I was driving home and I didn't notice,"" I lied to her, feeling a twinge of guilt because she was so sweet. ""I'm so sorry he's been bothering you.""



""It's not a problem, hon. He was really worried, so I didn't mind checking in on you.""



I'm sure he was was worried, but not for the reasons you might think. If he knew his side piece had gotten to me, he was probably worried I was too busy burning his possessions to answer the phone.



""Thanks for checking, Sasha. I'll find my phone and charge it so this doesn't happen again.""



""I'm just glad you're OK, Adira. Have a good night.""



""You, too. Thanks again.""



I watched to make sure she got into her house, then closed the door. I needed to go to sleep and put this day behind me.



He was really worried. Bullshit. By now, he probably realized he'd been caught and wanted me to answer so we could discuss the situation calmly, like adults. Make sure I wasn't going to do anything crazy. Probably suggest that we be friends, like mature, rational people. Since I'd already (jokingly, I swear) thought of murder and arson and then dialed it back to smelly fish mischief, I wasn't sure I was mature and rational enough to discuss Padon cheating on me. With Kayla.



I trudged to the kitchen, made myself a cup of Sleepytime Extra tea that would knock me out, and sat on the couch while I drank it, trying not to think or hurt. For the record, I was unsuccessful at both.



Noticing my engagement ring, I twisted it off my finger, remembering how happy I'd been when Padon had slipped it on my finger the night before he left. He'd had his head on my stomach and all of a sudden there was a ring box there, too.



""I want you to marry me, Dira. Nothing I want more in life, no one I've ever loved like you.""



I'd opened the box, all power of speech fleeing. Never did I think I'd be engaged, but there was a ring in front of me and Padon's statements hanging between us. He reached in and held out the pretty diamond and emerald ring to me.



""Do you want to wear my ring?""



I nodded, my eyes watering, my mouth trembling as he slid the ring onto my finger.



""You're officially mine now, Dira. You've given me all of you, and that's the best gift I've ever been given. So now that you've said yes, just so you know, there are no takebacks.""



Then he made love to me and I knew that was when he'd given me our son. It'd been slow and beautiful, and he'd looked into my eyes the entire time. Unfortunately, he didn't honor the gift I'd given to him, and I couldn't keep the gift he'd given to me. We'd been on a collision course with heartbreak from that moment on while thinking our future held only beauty.



I was no longer Padon's, not anymore, and I sure as hell could do a takeback when he had given to some other woman what I'd thought was exclusively mine. I could feel the tears forming again and got frustrated with myself.



Stop it, Adira. Go to bed. Forget for a while. No more crying tonight.



Following my very wise advice, I went to bed. I slept somehow (thank you Sleepytime tea), and I woke up in the morning, enjoying that brief moment of amnesia before I became fully awake and the prior day's events hit me with a spiked bat several hundred times.



""It was real,"" I said out loud. ""Yesterday wasn't a dream.""



Since no one jumped out of the closet to contradict me, I had no choice but to accept that it was true.



I'd gone to bed with my phone beside me but turned off. I was afraid to turn it on and see the messages that had rolled in while I was refusing to engage with anyone with the names of Padon the cheating low-life dickhead or Kayla the vile creature bitch.



I got dressed, needing a hit of caffeine, and left the house. I saw Sasha out weeding her flowers as I backed down the driveway, and she waved me down. I rolled down my window as she came over.



""Adira, Padon called me this morning and said he was worried because he still hadn't been able to reach you.""



Dammit, Padon, quit making me lie to to Sasha.



""Oh, that's because I discovered my phone isn't working."" Technically the truth. A phone can't work if it's turned off. ""In fact, I'm heading to the phone store now.""



Also not technically a lie because it happened to be next to the coffee shop.



""At this hour? Are they even open?""



""I'm getting coffee first so I'll be right next door. You can just tell him I'll call him as soon as my phone gets fixed and to please stop bothering you.""



""He's just worried and so anxious to talk with you.""



""Awww,"" I said. I just bet he's anxious.



""Well, I'll see you later, Sasha! Thanks for letting me know.""



She waved and headed back to her weeding, while I took off. Once I got my coffee, I sat at an outside table and turned on my phone. It was time to face reality.

As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast with an arsenal of coffee-related gadgets, I was pretty eager to test out the BUNN 33200.0015 VPR-2GD 12-Cup Pourover Commercial Coffee Brewer. This sleek, stainless-steel behemoth isn’t your everyday coffee maker—it claims to be built for businesses, but I was curious to see how it would perform in everyday use. After using it consistently for several weeks, I have plenty to share, both good and not-so-good. Let’s dive into the details.

**Design That Blends Utility and Elegance**

The first thing I noticed about this coffee brewer is its solid and compact design. With dimensions of 16.2""D x 8""W x 20.2""H, it fit remarkably well on my kitchen countertop, though it leans towards the larger side. The black and stainless-steel construction gives it a professional and clean look, which I personally appreciate in my kitchen appliances. The machine's two warmers—upper and lower—are excellent features, especially when hosting guests or serving a crowd. These keep your coffee hot without burning it, which is a godsend during marathon work-from-home sessions.

**Ease of Setup and Use**

Setting up the coffee brewer didn’t involve any elaborate instructions, which was a relief. There’s no plumbing required thanks to its pourover feature, meaning I only had to pour water manually into the tank. As someone who prefers appliances with a straightforward operation, I found it convenient. However, its commercial roots show—if you’re used to more automated systems, you might feel there’s an extra step or two here.

**Advantages**

- Built with sturdy stainless-steel and black accents, blending style with toughness.  
- Upper and lower warmers to serve multiple pots of coffee, great for multitasking.  
- No need for plumbing; the portability is a serious plus for occasional rearranging or hosting events.  

[Check BUNN 33200.0015 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0037xip22/)

**Performance: The Coffee Experience**

When it comes to brewing, this machine doesn’t mess around. It brews a full pot of coffee in under three minutes, which is jaw-droppingly fast for a manual pourover. This impressed not only me but also my coffee-loving coworkers when I tested it during a small office get-together. The coffee had a rich, clean taste—unsurprising given BUNN’s reputation for well-calibrated brewing systems.

The machine comes with two 64-ounce glass decanters, which were unexpectedly light yet durable. I found them particularly handy when hosting brunch for some family members. However, there’s no automatic off feature, so I had to remind myself to turn off the warmers when done. It’s small things like this that make you miss the creature comforts of modern automated appliances.

**Target Users: Who is This For?**

This coffee brewer isn’t just for commercial spaces like cafes or diners. While it’s excellent for high-volume brewing needs, I see its appeal for coffee aficionados who host frequently or have large families. If you’re someone who makes multiple pots of coffee daily or needs a versatile, durable brewing system, this might be up your alley. However, solo coffee drinkers—or those without ample counter space—might feel this machine is overkill.

**Drawbacks**

- No automatic shut-off feature, which some may find inconvenient.  
- The design might feel bulky in a smaller home kitchen setting.  

**Competing Products**

In the same category of commercial coffee brewers, the Zojirushi EC-YTC100X and Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select are key competitors worth mentioning. While the Zojirushi achieves nearly the same robust performance, I find it doesn’t match the BUNN model in terms of speed and simplicity. On the other hand, the Technivorm Moccamaster stands as a slightly more automated alternative, with features like auto-off and a sleeker industrial design. If automation is a priority for you, the Moccamaster edges out. However, when it comes to reliability in a fast-paced environment, this machine is hard to beat.

**Smart Spending**

Given its durability and high brewing speed, the price feels appropriate, especially if you regularly brew large quantities of coffee. While not the cheapest on the market, its features and reliability justify the cost for those who entertain often or run small-scale catering/coffee events. For the casual home coffee drinker, however, you may want to explore more affordable, smaller models.

I have just recently got a 1zpresso ZP6 as I heard it was the best grinder for pourover but I am struggling to dial it in. I am using a light roasted washed coffee with supposed notes of summer fruits which from what I have read appears ideal for the zp6. 

However, I am finding that my coffee tastes very empty, papery, and leaves a dry sensation on the tongue and throat. This was the case when I used grind size 4.5 and, assuming over extraction, I moved up to 5.5 but got similar results. 

I have checked the calibration of the grinder and everything appears to be fine there. From what I have read 4.5-5.5 appears to be the sweet spot so I am unsure why I am getting absolutely no flavour.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",2,1752781431.0,pourover,11,0.75,False

Hey there,

I’m a 33-year-old guy from Southeast Michigan (Thumb area), and I’m looking to meet a woman who’s down for an easygoing, fun, and real connection—no pressure, no drama, just good energy and honest vibes.

A little about me:
By day, I’m living the hybrid work life—flexible schedule, weird hours, and plenty of time to sneak away for a coffee, a hike, or an impromptu road trip. Weeknights, I’m all about keeping it low-key: trash TV, sports, a good book, or zoning out with a drink after a long day.


But weekends? That’s when I thrive. I’m big on anything outdoors—camping, kayaking, beachcombing, breweries, hiking, biking, getting lost somewhere scenic. I like being active, but I’m not out here trying to climb Everest. It’s more about soaking up the good weather and good company.

Vibes & personality:
Think laid-back with a sarcastic edge. I’m the kind of guy who can have you cracking up one minute and getting deep the next. I’m loyal, touchy-feely (in a good way), and I genuinely enjoy getting to know people. My love language is physical touch and witty banter—so if you like to tease, flirt, and dish it right back, we’ll get along just fine.

Physically:
5'10"", green eyes, brown hair, athletic build. No smoking, no drugs, social drinker, and disease-free. I keep myself in good shape and appreciate someone who takes care of themselves, but perfection isn’t the goal—authenticity is.

What I’m looking for:
A woman who’s confident, kind, and doesn’t take life (or herself) too seriously. Curvy? Outdoorsy? A little sarcastic or delightfully weird? Total win. I’m not looking to collect chats or ghost people—I’d rather have one or two solid, ongoing connections with someone who’s down for both fun and depth. We can start flirty and playful and just see where things go.

This isn’t a mass casting call—just one real connection that feels good, whether it’s daily texts, venting after work, sharing memes, or planning to meet up.

If you made it this far, shoot me a message that tells me a little more than “hey.” What’s your perfect lazy Sunday? What show do you secretly binge when no one’s watching? Or just throw a sarcastic one-liner at me—I’ll throw one back.

Let’s keep it light, honest, and fun—and if something more grows from it, even better.

Yes, this is a real post. No, I am not trying to sell you anything or recruit you to a pyramid scheme disguised as a candle business.

I’m just a human person from the southeastern US who would really like a friend. Not the kind where someone says “hey” and then vanishes into the void forever. A real one. Who wants to talk about horror movies that are either actually scary or accidentally hilarious? Or debate book endings. Or send each other weird little internet finds. Or talk about the state of our coffee addictions like it’s a weather update.



Some facts about me:

• I love horror movies (if it’s creepy or chaotic, I’ve probably watched it)

• I read a lot (fiction, mostly, so give me something dark and character-driven)

• I “run” (the quotes are doing a lot of work here)

• I am emotionally dependent on coffee

• I am friendly but mildly skeptical of most people, which makes friendship feel like a miracle



I’d love to actually chat with someone and build a real back-and-forth. I also like putting a face to the person I’m talking to, so I’m totally happy to swap photos early on. Not because looks matter — just because it’s nice to know who’s on the other end.

Just friendship here. If you’re secretly looking for more, this will be awkward for both of us. I’ve met a few people on here before, and most were either creepy or… let’s say not great. So, please just be normal. Or weird in the fun way.

My love language is physical touch and witty banter—so if you like to tease, flirt, and dish it right back, we’ll get along just fine.

Physically:
5'10"", green eyes, brown hair, athletic build. No smoking, no drugs, social drinker, and disease-free. I keep myself in good shape and appreciate someone who takes care of themselves, but perfection isn’t the goal—authenticity is.

What I’m looking for:
A woman who’s confident, kind, and doesn’t take life (or herself) too seriously. Curvy? Outdoorsy? A little sarcastic or delightfully weird? Total win. I’m not looking to collect chats or ghost people—I’d rather have one or two solid, ongoing connections with someone who’s down for both fun and depth. We can start flirty and playful and just see where things go.

This isn’t a mass casting call—just one real connection that feels good, whether it’s daily texts, venting after work, sharing memes, or planning to meet up.

If you made it this far, shoot me a message that tells me a little more than “hey.” What’s your perfect lazy Sunday? What show do you secretly binge when no one’s watching? Or just throw a sarcastic one-liner at me—I’ll throw one back.

Let’s keep it light, honest, and fun—and if something more grows from it, even better.

1m2h4uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relocating/comments/1m2h4uy/thinking_about_moving_to_north_georgia_single_mom/,"Thinking about moving to North Georgia, single mom looking for community, creativity, and a fresh start","Hey y’all! I’m a single mom to a hilarious, big-hearted 9-year-old girl, and I’m looking at North Georgia as our fresh start. Life's thrown a few curveballs (okay, maybe a whole batting cage), but I'm ready to build something more stable, more peaceful, and hopefully more me.

I'm looking for a town that feels like home, not just four walls, but a community. A place where my daughter can thrive in a great school, and I can grow, too, as a mom, an educator, and a creative person trying to reclaim her peace and spark.

A little about us:

* My daughter is 9 going on 30. She’s wildly creative, emotionally wise beyond her years, and always trying to make someone laugh. Think: comedian meets empath with a dash of chaos.
* We both love being outdoors — hiking, parks, nature walks — anything that gets us outside and moving.
* I’m studying to become a teacher and would love to find a district with a para-to-teacher program (any educators out there with insight?).
* I’m also a photographer, so any area with some local charm, nature, or seasonal events is a huge plus for me creatively.
* I love bookstores, hole-in-the-wall coffee shops, craft nights, live music, and anything that feels a little quirky or artsy.
* I’m also pretty social when I’m not burnt out, I’d love a town with chances to get involved, or just meet people who aren’t terrible humans.

What we’re looking for:

* Good schools for my daughter, first and foremost.
* Reasonable rent, we don’t need a lot. A downtown studio or small place within walking distance would be perfect.
* Walkability and things to do, parks, libraries, art spots, even just a good neighborhood vibe where we can make memories.
* Kid-friendly but still mom-friendly, somewhere that isn’t just about kids, but also gives me a chance to find peace, joy, and maybe even a little fun.

If you live in North Georgia and love it or even kinda like it, I’d love to hear about your area. What’s the vibe? Is it welcoming? What should I look out for? Any towns you’d recommend that don’t break the bank?

I’m not trying to be fancy, I just want a better life for my daughter and a more balanced one for me. Thanks so much for reading. 💛",1,1752781153.0,relocating,0,1.0,False

So a couple months ago, I learned Hawaii grows kola nuts. I contacted a farm and bought a bag. And made a mostly-Hawaiian kola using those nuts, cane sugar from Maui. And citrus, coffee cascara, mango, coriander and vanilla from the Big Island. (Cascara is the peel of the ripe coffee cherry. Interesting flavor, and another source of caffeine.) Imported ingredients: cinnamon stick, star anise, nutmeg.

Caramelized the sugar, infused my zest and juice, added the powders, reduced a bit and filtered into a swing-top bottle with scraped vanilla and the pod. Initial batch was rather bitter. Kept adding more cane sugar until it tasted right. Next time, half the kola nuts.

You've been on Zepbound for a bit now, maybe you've settled into a rhythm, and suddenly, it's time to talk about moving up to the next dose. If you're like me, you might feel a mix of excitement (hello, more progress!) and a tiny bit of apprehension (what if the side effects come back with a vengeance?). It's a completely normal feeling, and honestly, it's a big part of the Zepbound journey for most people.

Stepping up a dose isn't just about getting ""more"" medication; it's a carefully considered part of your treatment plan. It's about finding that **just right** level that helps you achieve your goals while keeping potential discomfort to a minimum. So, let's pull back the curtain and talk about what you can typically expect when your Zepbound dose gets a little boost.

**The ""Why"" Behind the Climb: Understanding Dose Escalation**

First things first, why do doctors recommend increasing your Zepbound dose in the first place? It's not just to shake things up, I promise! There's a very intentional process behind it.

**It's All About Titration**

Think of it like this: Zepbound isn't a one-size-fits-all medication where everyone starts and stays on the same dose. Instead, it uses a process called **titration**.

* **Starting Low:** You begin on a lower dose to allow your body to gradually adjust to the medication. This helps minimize initial side effects.
* **Gradual Increase:** Over time, your doctor will likely recommend increasing your dose step-by-step. This is typically done in four-week increments.
* **Finding Your Balance:** The goal is to find the **lowest effective dose** that provides the benefits you need without causing intolerable side effects.

**Finding Your ""Sweet Spot""**

Every body is different, right? What works perfectly for one person might be too much or too little for another. That's why titration is so important. It helps you and your doctor:

* **Maximize Efficacy:** As you go up in dose, you're usually increasing the medication's ability to:
 * Suppress appetite.
 * Reduce food cravings and ""food noise.""
 * Slow gastric emptying (making you feel fuller longer).
* **Minimize Side Effects:** By increasing gradually, your body has time to adapt, which can help lessen the intensity of any new or returning side effects. It's a balancing act, for sure.

**What to Expect When You Level Up**

So, you've got your new dose in hand. What's likely to happen after that first shot at a higher level?

**The Good Stuff: Enhanced Effects**

For many people, moving up a dose brings a noticeable increase in the positive effects of Zepbound. This is often what we're hoping for!

* **Stronger Appetite Suppression:** You might find yourself feeling less hungry, even at times you used to feel ravenous. Those usual hunger cues could be significantly diminished.
* **Quieter Food Noise:** That constant chatter in your brain about food - what to eat, when to eat, what you shouldn't eat - often gets quieter, or even completely silent. It's actually pretty amazing how much mental space this frees up.
* **Increased Satiety:** You'll likely feel full much faster when you eat, and that feeling of fullness tends to last longer. This can make it easier to eat smaller portions without feeling deprived.

**The Not-So-Fun Stuff: Potential Side Effects**

Now, let's be real. While the benefits often increase, so too can the potential for side effects, at least initially. It's not a guarantee, but it's good to be prepared.

Common side effects that might pop up or intensify with a dose increase include:

* **Nausea:** This is probably the most common one I hear about. It can range from a mild queasiness to something more pronounced.
* **Fatigue:** You might feel a bit more tired than usual for the first day or two after your shot.
* **Digestive Issues:** Constipation or diarrhea are also common. It's your gut adjusting to the new level of medication.
* **Headaches:** Some people report mild headaches.

Here's the thing about these side effects: **they often subside within a day or two**, or at least become much milder as your body adjusts to the new dose. It's usually a temporary phase, but it's important to acknowledge it.

**It's Not Always Linear**

I've found that sometimes, one dose increase might feel completely smooth, and the next one might bring a few more bumps in the road. And then, sometimes, you might go up a dose and actually experience *fewer* side effects than you did on a previous one! It's not a perfectly linear progression, and that's okay. Your body is unique, and its response will be too.

**Navigating the Transition: Tips for a Smoother Ride**

While you can't completely eliminate the possibility of side effects, there are definitely things you can do to make the transition to a higher dose a bit smoother.

**Hydration is Your Best Friend**

Seriously, I can't stress this enough. Staying well-hydrated is absolutely crucial.

* **Drink Water Constantly:** Keep a water bottle with you and sip throughout the day.
* **Electrolytes Help:** If you're feeling nauseous or experiencing diarrhea, consider adding an electrolyte drink.
* **Avoid Dehydrating Beverages:** Coffee and sugary drinks won't hydrate you effectively.

**Prioritize Protein and Fiber**

What you eat (and don't eat) can significantly impact how you feel on Zepbound.

* **Lean Protein:** Focus on lean proteins at every meal. This helps keep you full and can ease nausea.
* **Fiber-Rich Foods:** To combat constipation, make sure you're getting enough fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
* **Small, Frequent Meals:** Instead of large, heavy meals, try eating smaller portions more often. This can be easier on your digestive system.
* **Avoid Greasy/Spicy Foods:** These can often exacerbate nausea and other GI issues, especially when you're adjusting to a new dose.

**Listen to Your Body**

This might sound obvious, but it's easy to push through discomfort.

* **Rest When Needed:** If you feel fatigued, take it easy. Don't push yourself too hard.
* **Pace Yourself:** Don't try to cram in a massive workout on the day you take your shot if you're feeling off.
* **Adjust as Needed:** If a certain food makes you feel unwell, avoid it for a while.

**Timing Your Shot**

Some people find that the timing of their injection can make a difference, especially when adjusting to a new dose.

* **Evening Shot:** Many prefer to take their shot in the evening, so any initial fatigue or nausea happens while they're asleep.
* **Weekend Shot:** Taking it on a Friday evening, for example, gives you the weekend to adjust if you anticipate feeling some side effects.

**When to Connect with Your Healthcare Provider**

While some mild side effects are common and often temporary, there are definitely times when you should reach out to your doctor.

**Persistent or Severe Side Effects**

If you experience any of the following, it's time to make that call:

* **Severe Nausea or Vomiting:** If you can't keep food or liquids down.
* **Intense Abdominal Pain:** This could indicate something more serious.
* **Severe Dehydration Symptoms:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased urination.
* **Side Effects That Don't Improve:** If mild side effects persist for more than a few days and are significantly impacting your quality of life.

**Lack of Expected Changes**

On the flip side, if you've been on a higher dose for a few weeks and aren't noticing any of the expected benefits - like appetite suppression or reduced food noise - that's also a good reason to chat with your doctor. They might suggest staying on that dose longer, or discuss other options.

Ultimately, going up a Zepbound dose is a step forward in your journey. It's about optimizing your treatment to help you reach your health goals. It might come with a few temporary bumps, but with preparation and open communication with your healthcare team, you've got this!",1,1752780637.0,ZepboundGuide,0,1.0,False

A month ago, id just gotten an internship doing machine learning stuff for an actual cool looking startup (not one of the slop ones). Unpaid, but that was okay because i already got bread from my research and desk work jobs. Id sit at my dorm's front desk and work from 8am-1pm a few days a week, spending maybe ten minutes logging packages and the rest drinking coffee and working. then, id work a little more and/or see friends and/or work out. I was about to get bangs and, a week from then, on the morning of my birthday, my friends would tell me that they were throwing me a party, and we would all dance the night away while people took turns djing, even though it was a weekday. I had friends from everywhere doing everything (from working 12 hours a day at some startup in nyc under a deeply evil boss to doing a marine conservation program in portugal), and i was secretly sharing my summer housing with my lovely boyfriend, and i was planning a trip to the western u.s. my only problems were 1. a really bad spell of brain fog that lasted for a few weeks (sounds like zoomer tik tok disease but i swear something was wrong with me i still locked in though everything would just take me like 3x longer) 2. i was not speaking to my mom or sister. Now, everything is even better. i am talking to my mom again and my parents met and love my boyfriend and i went West and ran around the mountains. my internship is making me do web development now which i hate and suck at, but thats my only real complaint.

however, one day in my mountain trip i just started hating my work and not wanting or knowing how to do any of it. everyone was working remotely so we spent a few days of the trip just hanging out in the living room and working from 9-5 and then going on adventures until the sun set (so at like 10, wowowow) then making dinner then watching a movie. but my 9-5 was just spent locked in my room staring at the ceiling. i got back, had a fun weekend, and now its more of the same. I have done barely any work since my trip and i know its going to catch up to me. Not only do i usually love work, i also know that i have a 99th percentile life, and while i got it largely through luck it is my work that keeps it alive. But i just cant stop destroying it. I feel deeply flawed and stupid and evil and like i have no future and am not good at anything, and you can guess what that kind of thinking leads me to want to do. Also, after years of turning my nose up at the overuse of meds of such nature i got a Wellbutrin prescription  as easily as one might get candy from cvs. Seriously, ridiculous stuff. It's so easy. ive had my fair share of fuckups and have crashed out over being significantly less smart than those around me, but nothing ever like this, even when i was doing spiritually destructive things like going on social media and trying to go into finance. It's like the part of my brain that knows that effort -> happiness has stopped working and i dont know how to turn it back on. Maybe i just need to force myself back into the gym (i have completely stopped going after three and a half years of consistency which is definitely not helping me).

Now, when i go to my desk job, all i do for five hours is forward mail. There is a large buildup of mail, both from the week i went West (NO ONE HERE DOES THEIR JOB BUT ME i do get late often though) and from the school year, since many people simply dont check their mailboxes. I used to have a strategy for looking like i handled 80% of new mail while only actually only handling 20%, because I hated thinking about how wasteful it all was, everything i had to RTS and everything that would simply get tossed, unopen. But now i cant stop. It's like a disease. I have the forwarding addresses of people who get a lot of mail memorized so, when new mail gets here, it's gone in seconds. Im generational, the best to ever do it. I should spend the rest of my shift doing anything else. But instead i keep forwarding and forwarding and forwarding.",1,1752780495.0,redscarepod,0,0.67,False

when i really want to think about it, i think it’s because he was everything i never allowed myself to dream of. i grew up on the romance of book love, where an unsuspecting girl always ends up with the beautiful talented man who would burn the world down for her. in my mind that’s the love i’ve always craved for myself, but after i got badly heartbroken from my first relationship and a string of bad ones after that, i gave up on it completely. i spent the last few years thinking i was just unlucky, that i found my love as a teenager and lost it, and i had no choice but to settle for best. but when i met him, he was so perfect in all the ways that mattered. 

he was so hot, that was the first thing i noticed about him. he was hot in a way that was attractive to ME, not the conventionally attractive way that has never appealed to me at all. he had curly hair, he was tall, he was muscled with tattoos and he had kind eyes. he made the effort to talk to me first, and he gave me a discount on coffee because i worked in the area (which i later found out was a lie, he just wanted an excuse). when i gave him my number, he texted me after 3 minutes. we chatted for hours that first day, and he kept the conversation going. he made me laugh, and we had the same sense of humour. when i got my daily coffee before work, he gave me up to 10 pumps of caramel because he knew i loved it. he told me i was out of his league and made me feel beautiful every day. he loved listening to me rant about anything. he called me “his girl.” he wanted to take photos of me when he thought i was pretty. when things got more serious, he was kind and kissed my forehead, and he cuddled me with so much adoration that i allowed myself to fall in love. there was no way a man this loving towards me didn’t want to not commit to me. 

as all things did, it ended. too quickly. i blame myself, even though i know it was for the best. i’m still so disappointed and hurt. i wanted him to commit to me. not being able to call him my boyfriend hurt. i met his entire family. they had heard us in bed. i had told my family all about him. we were talking about going on a holiday in a few months. i had started learning about anime just to be able to talk to him about it. i didn’t know what was stopping him. he didn’t have anyone else. all his friends were on a different continent. i wanted to be his friend as well as his girlfriend so he wouldn’t be alone. he said i was too good for him. i still don’t know what that means, but i know it’s not true. 

i’ve tried meeting other men on Tinder but they’re not him. I look for him in every man. His hair, his cap, his eyes. i’m disappointed when i never see him. we work in the same area and he avoids me like the plague. i don’t understand. i miss him. i want to know he’s okay. i haven’t seen him in weeks. i’m scared he’s changed jobs and ill never be able to see him again, even though the sight of him freezes my blood and makes my heart beat out of my chest. i want to feel his eyes on me again. 

i’ve spent my life feeling like the in-between. never mixing in fully with a friend group. being friends with both the popular kids and the weird kids but never really being either. liking the boys cuter than me but only get attention from boys less attractive to me. being “too much” for one person and “too little” to another. always switching masks to fit the situation to the point where i don’t know who i am without one. being essentially unlabeled. he made me feel like i fit with him. like he was just like me. like i had a place in the world, because someone else was there with me. i have never clicked with someone the way i did with him. he understood me and my thoughts. he knew how i would react before i did. he read me like an open book. i never felt like i needed to pretend. he just threw it all away. 

i’m fighting the urge to talk to him. my heart strongly believes this is only temporary, and that love like this couldn’t be for nothing. that it’s only a matter of time before he reaches out. even writing this down makes me feel stupid. but i genuinely believe it. i can’t accept that it’s over. it was done so fast. he must regret it. i don’t believe that it was all an act, and that he did all of this to hurt me. he was crying on the phone the last time we talked. i keep waiting for his text. i feel like an idiot. there have been worse losses but i feel like im just incredibly weak and pathetic. i want to move away to lessen the pain but i think the distance would just make me more upset. i thought i had met someone that felt like home. i can’t believe i had it for such a wonderful but short period of time before it got ripped away from me. this feels like a cruel, cruel joke with my constant and lingering pain being part two.

I’m in my early 30s and was just diagnosed ADHD in May of this year. Was referred by my PCP to behavioral therapy where I was assessed and diagnosed by therapist and psychiatrist team. The Psychiatrist recommended Adderall XR 10mg with the option to titrate up by 5mg per week to a max of 30mg. My pcp was the prescribing physician and prefers to go a month on a dose before going up. I did one month at 10mg generic adderall XR and noticed a positive difference at first but after a week or two I seemed to plateau and no longer felt a noticeable change. I was then prescribed 15mg of generic adderall XR and have been taking it for about 7 weeks. While the 15mg seemed to really be helping with my adhd symptoms and binge eating, it also caused anxiety and irritability. I basically have no patience, I hate everyone (can’t stand to be around my family and just want to be left alone), and have crippling anxiety. These side effects are definitely worsened by caffeine, but I still experience them even when I avoid caffeine. I have never tolerated caffeine well and although I’m a daily coffee drinker as of a few years ago, I can typically only handle one cup of coffee. Before I was a daily coffee drinker, and since becoming a daily coffee drinker, I get shaky, anxious, irritable, and headaches if I have too much caffeine. My pcp and I agree I don’t seem to tolerate stimulants very well. The problem is the generic adderall XR was helping my adhd symptoms that had been negatively impacting my daily life before my diagnosis so I don’t want to give up on meds all together. I just can’t stay on the generic adderall with the negative side effects because it’s not fair to my husband and children for me to be impatient, anxious, and miserable all day. Anyone else unable to tolerate stimulants and found another med that worked well for them? I’m desperate!

TLDR: 32F newly diagnosed adhd and seem to be unable to tolerate stimulant meds (generic adderall XR 15mg). Looking for other medications that have worked for people unable to tolerate stimulants.",1,1752780269.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

My Alpha mate cheated on me with my sister— and now, he gave her the only chance to survive… again! ""Get my niece the hell out of this goddamn hospital!"" A massive figure appeared. The ground seemed to shake. A Lycan. ""Fiona, I’ve searched for you for years. Today, I fulfill your father’s dying wish— To return everything he built… to his Alpha heiress.""Chapter 1: Broken PromisesFiona’s POVI couldn’t stop smiling as I sped down the road toward home. My wolf was practically howling with joy, pacing under my skin like she couldn’t wait to tell him either. After everything—years of negative tests, hormone treatments, failed full moon blessings—it had finally happened. I was pregnant.Pregnant. With Alpha Dorian’s pup.The two pink lines on the test still felt unreal. I’d taken three more just to be sure. And now, here I was, heart thudding like war drums, a storm of dreams and baby names filling my head. He was going to be so happy. This was the miracle we’d been waiting for. Our second chance. Our forever.I pulled into the driveway of our packhouse and grabbed my purse, the test still zipped up safely inside like a fragile secret. My boots crunched over gravel as I rushed to the front door, already picturing the stunned joy on Dorian’s face when I told him.But the moment I stepped inside, something felt... off.The air was too still. No scent of dinner. No firewood burning in the hearth. Just the faint whiff of perfume—sickly sweet and definitely not mine.I frowned and looked around. The living room was a mess—cushions scattered, a wine glass half-full on the table, and clothes tossed around. My wolf stirred uneasily.And then I saw it.A lacy black bra I didn’t recognize, draped right across the back of our couch.My breath caught. I stepped forward and picked it up, the fabric trembling in my hands. It smelled like her. Not just any she—Cecilia. My sister.A chill crawled down my spine. My wolf let out a low growl deep inside me, the sound laced with confusion and dread. I tried to shake it off. Maybe she was just visiting. Maybe she changed here, went for a run, something—anything.But I already knew.I dropped the bra and followed the trail of clothes—Dorian’s shirt, a pair of jeans, a heel—down the hall. My pulse roared in my ears, drowning out everything but the low, unmistakable sounds coming from the bedroom.Moans. Soft and hungry.I froze at the doorway, one hand gripping the frame like it could hold me together. My heart pounded so loud . But I pushed the door open anyway, praying I was wrong.And then I saw them.Dorian. My mate. My Alpha.In bed.With Cecilia.They were tangled together.The pregnancy test slipped from my fingers, landing on the floor with a tiny thud.“What the hell is this?” I choked out. My voice cracked, part sob, part snarl. My wolf was reeling, snapping, trying to understand why our mate—our mate—had betrayed us.Dorian scrambled out of bed, panic on his face as he grabbed for the nearest blanket. “Fiona, this isn’t—”“Save it!” I snapped, my throat tight, lungs burning. My gaze shifted to Cecilia, lounging on the bed like she owned the place.She gave me a smile that made my skin crawl. “Don’t look so shocked, Fiona,” she said, voice dripping venom. “Did you really think you were enough for an Alpha?”Rage and heartbreak collided inside me.“Dorian,” I whispered, turning to him, hoping—begging—for a flicker of regret in his eyes. “After everything... after all we’ve survived together... how could you?”He couldn’t even look at me. He yanked on his shirt, eyes fixed somewhere over my shoulder. “It’s not what you think,” he muttered.“Not what I think?” I laughed, but it came out broken. “You’re in bed with my sister, Dorian. Tell me—was this your plan all along? While I was bleeding and praying to the Moon Goddess for a pup, you were screwing her?”Cecilia stretched, smug and unbothered. “We’ve been together for months,” she said, watching my reaction like it was entertainment. “He’s sick of you, Fiona. All that crying, all that desperate clinging... he needed someone who made him feel like a real Alpha again.”Her eyes flicked to the test on the floor. “And I’m guessing that didn’t go the way you wanted, either.”I instinctively wrapped a hand around my belly, as if I could shield the tiny life growing inside me from their poison. My wolf growled, a deep, vibrating sound of grief and fury.“You don’t know anything about me,” I spat. “You never did. You’re both traitors.”Dorian stepped forward, reaching out.I recoiled.“Don’t touch me,” I warned, my voice low. “I can’t believe I ever loved you. Either of you.”His hand dropped. So did any remaining pretense.Cecilia laughed. “So dramatic,” she said. “You were always good at playing the victim. But Dorian’s mine now. And you? You were just a discarded shewolf.”My fists clenched so hard my claws threatened to break skin.“I gave you everything,” I said to Dorian, barely above a whisper. “My love. My loyalty. My whole damn life. And you threw it all away for this?”He said nothing. Not a word. Just looked away like a coward.And that was it. That was the moment I felt something inside me break. A clean, cold snap. Whatever bond we once had—it was gone. The mate pull still hummed faintly between us, but I knew in my bones it would never feel the same again.“Maybe it’s best if you just leave,” he said finally, voice flat. “Cecilia and I... we’re together now. You deserve better than this.”I stared at him, the final blow landing like a silver dagger straight to the heart.There it was—the last nail in the coffin of my marriage, hammered in by the very Alpha I had once trusted with my life, my body, my soul. I backed away slowly, legs trembling, but I kept my head high. He wasn’t going to see me break. Neither of them were.“I hope you both rot,” I said, voice calm, too calm. The tears burned hot behind my eyes, but I didn’t let them fall.I turned and walked out, leaving behind the wreckage of everything I’d ever believed in. The bond between us was nothing but ash now.The moment I stepped outside, the cold air hit me like a slap. I slammed the door shut behind me so hard the frame rattled. My hands were shaking as I climbed into my car, still clutching the pregnancy test like a fragile piece of hope. The engine roared to life, and I drove. No destination. No plan. Just... away.Away from that cursed house, now a graveyard for every dream I’d ever had.Away from the scent of betrayal that still clung to my skin.Away from the Alpha who had sworn to protect me and instead ripped me apart from the inside out.City lights streaked past in a blur, my wolf snarling low and furious in my chest. She wanted to run, to shift and rip something to shreds. But we both knew we couldn’t—not yet. We weren’t just angry. We were wounded.My phone buzzed on the seat next to me. His name lit up the screen: Dorian.My stomach twisted. I didn’t want to hear his voice. But fury got the better of me. I snatched up the phone and answered, my voice sharp and venomous.“What the hell do you want?”His voice came through cold, almost bored. “I’ve instructed my lawyer to send over the divorce papers. Sign them. It’s over.”I blinked. For a moment, I couldn’t breathe. Just like that? After everything? After every full moon we spent curled together, every promise whispered into my hair?“You think you can just mail me a piece of paper and wipe your hands clean?” I snapped. “You think it ends like that? You’re a pathetic, spineless coward, Dorian.”He sighed. That lazy, arrogant sigh he used whenever something annoyed him. “Fiona, don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Cecilia and I are moving forward. You should too.”“Moving forward?” I nearly laughed. “You mean crawling into bed with my sister like a rabid mutt? You don’t know the first damn thing about love or loyalty. You make a mockery of the title Alpha.”His silence cracked, and suddenly, his voice flared sharp and cruel.“At least she satisfies me better than you, bitch!”The words hit me like claws to the chest, tearing through muscle, through bone, right into the heart of me. I gasped, my hand flying to my sternum as if I could physically stop the pain from spreading. It was like being punched in the lungs. For a second, I thought I might pass out.But then the fire returned. My wolf surged forward, claws dragging against my ribs, begging to be let loose. I didn’t let her take over, but I used her rage.“You take that back!” I roared, my voice shaking with fury. “You think that pathetic excuse for an insult means anything coming from you? You’re nothing, Dorian! A spineless, low-grade mutt of a man who couldn’t handle a real she-wolf, so you settled for trash.”He didn’t respond, but I didn’t need him to. I wasn’t done.“You think Cecilia’s some kind of prize?” I spat. “She’s a two-faced, venom-tongued snake who feeds on attention. She’s playing you, Dorian. Just like she’s played every other fool who’s ever looked twice at her. You’re not special. You’re just the next idiot on her list.”Still nothing from his end. Not even a breath.“You betrayed the only person who actually loved you. You broke the mate bond—not just spiritually, but morally. You threw away your Luna, your pack's respect, everything, for what? A few cheap thrills and a bitch who couldn’t hold loyalty if you tied it to her wrist?”He finally scoffed, but I cut him off before he could say another word.“You know what? I pity you,” I hissed. “Because one day, when Cecilia leaves you high and dry, when your pack loses faith in you and you realize you’ve built your life on lies—you’ll look in the mirror and see what I see. A weak, pathetic male who let everything good slip through his claws.”My chest heaved with every word.“So enjoy your trash heap of a life, Dorian. You and Cecilia are perfect for each other—two toxic souls destined to ruin whatever they touch. But don’t come crawling back. Don’t ever speak my name again. You are nothing to me now. Nothing. And you never will be again.”I ended the call.My hand was still trembling as I threw the phone onto the passenger seat. But it wasn’t fear or heartbreak anymore—it was release.His words had stung like hell. But mine? Mine had scorched the earth. And now, there was nothing left of us but ash.Let him wallow in his own mess. Let him rot beside the woman who helped him tear it all down.Because I was done with Alpha Dorian.For good.And this time, I wasn’t looking back.Chapter 2: Breaking PointFiona’s POVI sank into the couch, the cushions swallowing me whole. My hand moved on autopilot, fishing for chips and chocolate from the mountain of junk food I'd piled on the coffee table. I shoved a fistful of salt and grease into my mouth, not even tasting it anymore. Just... chewing. Existing. Barely.It had been a month.A month since my mate—Alpha Dorian—shattered my life with a single betrayal. A month since my sister, Cecilia, carved out my heart with her poisonous smile and took what wasn’t hers. A month of pretending I was okay while bleeding out behind closed doors.Every day blurred into the next. Wake up. Cry. Eat. Vomit. Sleep. Repeat.I’d shifted only once in that time, and my wolf hadn’t spoken to me since. She was grieving too, locked in some dark place inside me. She was quiet in a way that scared me more than Dorian’s cruelty. We used to be fierce. Now we were both just... numb.I’d forgotten how to take care of myself. My glow had dimmed. I’d gained weight. My wolf’s connection to the baby kept me grounded, but just barely. Most days, I felt like a shell—bloated with regret and sadness and salt-crusted tears.The front door creaked open, and I didn’t even flinch. My nose picked up Chloe’s scent—lavender, pine, and cinnamon. Comfort. My best friend. My pack-sister by bond if not blood.“Fiona…” Her voice dropped when she saw me. “You look like a sad little potato that’s been left out in the sun.”I snorted, a wet, snot-filled sound that might’ve been a laugh. Maybe. “Thanks,” I croaked, wiping my face with the back of my sleeve.Chloe tossed her bag onto the armchair and crossed her arms, glaring at me. “You can’t keep doing this, Fi. You’ve got a pup in your belly , you’re not meant to rot on a damn couch.”I shook my head, more tears falling. “I don’t know how to stop. Everything hurts. It’s like... every breath is a reminder that he’s betraying.”Her expression hardened. “It’s been a month, babe. A whole-ass lunar cycle. And you’re still crying over that spineless excuse of an Alpha?”I curled inward, the sobs crashing down again like a tidal wave I couldn’t hold back. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Chloe!” My voice cracked, hoarse with grief. “I have a baby growing inside me and no mate. No pack. No one but you.”My shoulders shook violently as I gasped for air. The pain, the betrayal, the abandonment—it all came out in one messy, snot-covered meltdown.Chloe was beside me in seconds, her arms wrapping around me. “There, there, baby. It’s okay,” she whispered, stroking my hair like I was a child. Her wolf reached out to mine instinctively, offering comfort where mine had gone silent.I wanted to believe her. I really did. But part of me still clung to the delusion that Dorian would walk through that door, apologize, beg, say it was all a mistake. That he’d snap out of whatever spell my sister had him under and come back to me.But he wasn’t coming back.He’d marked her. Claimed her. He’d tossed away the Luna of his pack for my sister—the same one who used to pull my hair and lie to our parents about me. He’d made his choice. And it wasn’t me.“You’re not alone,” Chloe said softly, pressing her forehead to mine. “You’ve got me. And you’ve got that baby. That little heartbeat you’re growing? That’s proof you’re stronger than you think.”I nodded weakly. It was all I could manage.After a while, Chloe brushed my wild hair out of my face like I was a kid who’d just woken from a nightmare. “Come on,” she coaxed, standing and holding out her hand. “Let’s go make something real to eat. Something that doesn’t come in a crinkly bag.”I hesitated. Every cell in my body wanted to stay curled up and dissolve into the couch. But then I looked at her—my only constant since everything fell apart—and I let her pull me up.We shuffled into the kitchen, the silence between us warm, not awkward. Chloe was the only one who hadn’t abandoned me. Hell, she’d practically moved in. Slept on my floor. Cooked. Cleaned. Held me when I screamed into the night like a feral thing. She was everything Cecilia had never been—a true sister.I stood at the counter, half-aware of the knife in my hand as I robotically chopped a tomato. My eyes glazed over, and Chloe must’ve noticed, because she stopped stirring the pot and glanced over.There was a lot of pain in her gaze. And not just for me—with me. She understood. She saw me. Not just the mess, but the woman who used to laugh too loud and chase deer on full moons.“You know,” she said after a long pause, “we should get away for a bit. Just us girls. A cabin near the river maybe, or a spa in Crescent Hollow. You need a break. And your wolf needs to run.”I tried to smile, but it felt cracked. “I don’t know, Chloe. I feel so heavy. I can’t pretend to be okay when I’m not. Every shadow in this house reminds me of what I lost. It’s like he’s still here, haunting me.”Chloe set the spoon down with a soft clink, wiped her hands on a dish towel, and crossed the kitchen to me. Before I could flinch, she gently took the knife from my trembling hands and wrapped me in a hug so tight it almost cracked the walls I’d built around myself.“You don’t have to be okay right now,” she whispered against my hair. “But you do have to keep going. For yourself. For your pup. You’re not defined by the people who broke you, Fiona. You’re more than what they left behind.”I clung to her like a lifeline, my face pressed against her shoulder. She smelled like lavender, pine, and cinnamon. Safe. Steady. My wolf stirred faintly for the first time in days, nudging me from within like she remembered what comfort used to feel like.“I just…” I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat like a stone. “I don’t know how to be anything other than this mess. I really thought Dorian and I—” My voice cracked, heat flaring behind my eyes. “I thought we were forever. But then Cecilia—”Her name tasted like poison in my mouth.“She took everything, Chloe. Everything. And now I’m just… empty. Like a house no one wants to live in anymore.”Chloe pulled back, her hands cupping my face with gentleness. “She didn’t take everything. You still have you. And you’ve got me. And you’ve got that strong little heartbeat inside you.” She looked down, placing a hand gently on my belly. “That’s not nothing, Fi. That’s a beginning.”I was about to answer,but then the TV blared behind us, interrupting the fragile quiet we’d created.The screen lit up with flashing red graphics:BREAKING NEWS: AMBERSY PACK ALPHA DORIAN SEEN WITH CECILIA BLACKWOOD—BABY BUMP ON DISPLAY WHILE SHOPPING FOR INFANT CLOTHES. IS HE THE FATHER? WHERE’S HIS FIRST LUNA?The words hit me harder than any rogue’s claws ever could.I turned in slow motion, my heart already shattering before I even saw it. But then, there they were. Dorian and Cecilia. Strolling through a boutique, hand in hand, smiling.Cecilia’s belly was round and unmistakable beneath a tight ivory dress. Dorian had his hand on the small of her back, his expression soft and proud in a way that used to be mine. I’d seen that look before—when he promised we’d be a family. When he said I was his mate.I staggered back, my wolf howling inside me like she’d been stabbed. The kitchen spun, blurring at the edges as if the world itself had snapped out of orbit.“No…” The word tore from my throat, broken and small. “No, no, no—this can’t be happening!”My knees gave out, and I collapsed onto the cold tile floor. I pressed both hands to my chest like I could physically hold my heart together, but the cracks were everywhere. My sobs came out in violent waves, half-growl, half-grief.“What the fuck!” I screamed, the words burning in my throat. “What the actual fuck is happening?!”Chloe dropped beside me, grabbing my hands. Her wolf aura flared, trying to anchor mine. “Fiona, breathe—breathe with me, okay? They’re not worth this. You can’t let them destroy you.”But her voice felt far away.All I could see was Cecilia, radiant and smug, stealing everything I loved. All I could feel was Dorian’s betrayal—his lies, his mark on my neck that still hadn’t faded, even though he had already replaced me.My wolf howled again, louder now, wild and unhinged. She wanted blood. She wanted answers. She wanted revenge.“How could he do this to me?” I sobbed, tears blinding me. “I gave him everything, Chloe. My loyalty. My body. My soul. I was his Luna, his mate. And now he’s having a pup with her?”I curled in on myself, shaking with the kind of sorrow that claws its way into your bones and stays there.Chloe wrapped her arms around me like a shield, rocking me gently. “You are so much more than this moment,” she whispered fiercely. “I know it hurts like hell right now, but you will survive this. Alpha Dorian is a liar, and Cecilia—she’s not even worth hating.”I pulled away slightly, trying to wipe my tears but they kept coming. “Why wasn’t I enough?” I rasped. “Why her? Why wasn’t I enough to keep him?”She held my gaze, her own eyes glistening with unshed tears. “This isn’t about you, Fiona. It never was. This is about two selfish, broken people who don’t know how to love anything but themselves. You didn’t fail. They did.”Her words hit somewhere deep, but I couldn’t absorb them yet. Not while my heart was still bleeding all over her kitchen floor. Every breath I took felt like I was swallowing glass. Every second that passed was one more I had to live with this truth.Chloe’s voice felt far away, like she was calling to me from the bottom of a canyon. Her words echoed and blurred.“One step at a time,” she said gently, her eyes searching mine, her voice laced with worry. “We’ll get through this together.”But I couldn’t answer her.Everything around me was spinning—too fast, too loud, too bright. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, wild and erratic like a cornered wolf. My skin burned hot, then cold, then hot again, as if my body didn’t know what to feel anymore.I tried to steady myself, blinking hard, willing my legs to cooperate. But they betrayed me—just like he had.I reached out for the counter, desperate for something solid, something real. My fingers brushed the edge but slipped. My hands were trembling so badly I couldn’t even hold myself up.“Fiona?” Chloe’s voice sharpened, panic rising. She stepped closer, but she sounded like she was underwater now.I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. My wolf whimpered inside me, weak and curled up, barely hanging on.And then... everything tilted.The room flipped sideways and my knees gave out completely. I collapsed—hard and fast—onto the floor. My body hit the tile like a rag doll dropped from a cliff.The last thing I heard was Chloe screaming my name.“FIONA!”And then…Darkness.Complete, suffocating black.Chapter 3: Desperate MeasuresFiona’s POVEverything was dark.Not the peaceful kind of dark, the kind that wraps you up and lets you sleep. This was the kind that felt like drowning. Heavy. Suffocating. Endless.I could hear voices. Chloe’s voice was the loudest, full of fear and urgency, but I couldn’t make out the words. I wanted to answer her. I tried to move. I couldn’t. My body felt like stone.Then came the scent—Disinfectant, herbal scent. An unfamiliar male werewolf.Chloe must’ve called someone. Smart girl.The darkness slowly peeled back. I was drifting upward, toward the surface.By the time my eyes fluttered open, I saw Chloe kneeling beside me, her face etched with worry, and a man crouched over me—mid-thirties, silver-rimmed glasses slipping down his nose, a stethoscope looped around his neck. A human doctor. No... not quite. His scent carried the faintest trace of wolf. Not a warrior. A medic.“Fiona?” Chloe’s voice cracked as she touched my arm. “Hey, you’re okay. You collapsed, but you’re safe. Dr. Harper’s here.”I blinked up at them, trying to focus, but my brain felt like it had been run through a meat grinder. “What… happened?”“You fainted,” Chloe said gently. “Shock, stress, exhaustion—you name it.”Dr. Harper gave me a tight-lipped smile. “Your vitals are stable now, but you’re severely depleted. Whatever you're going through, it's pushing your body to its limit. We need to monitor you more closely. And… I’ll need to speak to your mate.”At that word—mate—my heart twisted.Chloe hesitated, her eyes darting toward me. “Alpha Dorian’s… he’s gone,” she said tightly. “He left her.”Dr. Harper’s eyebrows rose, just slightly. “I see.” His tone shifted. “Well, then, I need someone close to her—someone who understands what she’s going through. She shouldn’t be doing this alone. The emotional strain is affecting not just her health, but the pup’s.”Pup.That word still sounded foreign in my ears, even though it was growing inside me. Half mine. Half his.When Dr. Harper finished his examination, he looked down at me with the kind of concern. “There are several tests I’d like to run. They’re important—for both of you. But they’ll cost. When you’re ready, come to the clinic, and we’ll begin. Until then, rest. Don’t push yourself, Miss.”With that, he gathered his things and left. Chloe watched him go, chewing her lip, probably already worrying about the money, the stress, the spiraling mess I was dragging her into.I sat up slowly, my head still throbbing. But something inside me had snapped back into place. Maybe it was desperation. Maybe it was instinct. Maybe it was just plain old stupidity. But I knew what I had to do.“This is it,” I said quietly. “I have to go to Dorian. Tell him what the doctor said. Maybe… maybe if he knows how serious this is, he’ll come back.”Chloe spun toward me like I’d slapped her. “Are you kidding me?”I flinched.She threw her hands in the air, pacing the kitchen. “Fiona, Alpha Dorian left you. He’s with Cecilia. You don’t get to just waltz into his life and expect a fucking miracle.”“I just—” My voice cracked. “I need to try, Chloe. The doctor said the father needs to be involved. I can’t just sit here doing nothing.”Chloe’s eyes narrowed, her hands on her hips. “Try what? Getting ripped to shreds all over again? Fiona, have you seen yourself lately? You’re a wreck. You’re not eating. You’re not sleeping. Your wolf is hiding. And now you want to go back to the alpha who humiliated you?”My throat burned. “I know it sounds crazy, but if there’s even a chance he’ll come back—if he sees how serious this is—”“NO!” she snapped. “He’s not going to swoop in and save you, Fiona. He already made his choice. He picked her. And what about your pup, huh? You really want to drag your unborn baby back into that toxic mess?”“I’m not doing this for me,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I’m doing this for the pup. If Dorian’s involved, we might get the resources for the tests. I just... I need him to know.”Chloe stared at me, her jaw clenched tight. “So what if he slams the door in your face? What if he laughs in your face with Cecilia on his arm? Are you ready for that?”“No,” I admitted. “But I have to try anyway. He deserves to know what’s at stake. And maybe, just maybe, he’ll realize what he’s walking away from.”Chloe was breathing hard, pacing the room like a wolf locked in a cage. Her anger crackled in the air, hotter than a silver brand.“You’re going to lose yourself trying to fight for someone who’s already made his choice,” she snapped, her voice rising like a growl. “What happens when he turns you away? You’ll be right back where you started—only more broken than before! Use your damn head, Fiona. Stop acting like some desperate bitch. There are plenty of dicks out there, for Moon’s sake! Forget about him, girl!”Her words stung, even though I knew they came from a place of love. That was the thing about Chloe—she didn’t sugarcoat a damn thing. And normally, I’d thank her for that. But not today.I swallowed the lump in my throat. My hands were clenched at my sides, my wolf stirring uneasily beneath my skin. “I don’t know what else to do,” I said quietly, trying to hold myself together. “If I don’t try… I’ll never forgive myself. I need to know I did everything I could—for our pup.”She stopped pacing. Her shoulders dropped, and for a second, all the fire left her eyes. “Fiona…” Her voice was softer now, tinged with something that hurt even worse than anger—pity. “You’re not thinking clearly. You’re spiraling. This isn’t just about Dorian anymore. It’s about your pup. About your health. You look like hell. You smell like sorrow and missed meals.”I flinched. My wolf did too.She stepped closer, her hands braced on the desk. “You’re a mess. And the last thing you need is to go chasing a male who threw you away like last season’s omega.”“I can’t just give up,” I whispered, my voice breaking.“Why the hell not?” she snapped again, but this time her tone wasn’t fiery—it was broken. “Let him go, Fiona. You owe him nothing. He left you. Chose Cecilia. He didn’t even look back. And now you want to crawl back to him like some fairytale’s broken heroine? Get real.”“I can’t let him think there are no consequences,” I said, wiping at my face uselessly. “He needs to know what he did. He needs to face this.”Chloe stared at me . Then she blew out a breath, long and loud, trying to calm herself. “Okay, fine. If you’re set on doing this, at least promise me something.”I nodded, my jaw tight.“Promise me you won’t expect him to come running. Promise me you won’t fall apart if he slams the door in your face. And promise me that if you come crawling back here in tears, I get to say ‘I told you so.’ Out loud. With snacks.”Despite everything, I let out a shaky laugh. “I promise.”Tears were still falling, but there was a flicker of something inside me—hope or delusion, I couldn’t say. “I just need to know that I tried. I need to look my pup in the eye someday and say I did everything I could.”Chloe sighed, rubbing her temple like she had a headache the size of a mountain troll. “Alright. But be ready. This could end badly. Don’t let that stubborn hope of yours blind you to reality.”“I know.” My voice was barely above a whisper. “But I have to do this.”A surge of adrenaline pushed through my veins. Maybe it was stupid. Maybe it was reckless. But it felt right. “I’m gonna put on some makeup,” I said suddenly, wiping my cheeks dry. “I need to look like I’m not dying inside.”I turned and bolted for the stairs, my bare feet thudding against the hardwood. Halfway up, I tripped on a step and caught myself with the railing.“Careful!” Chloe shouted after me, her voice sharp with concern. “You’re pregnant, you idiot!”I ignored her and kept going, my heart pounding. I knew exactly what I was doing, even if no one else did.Back in my room, I stood in front of the mirror, staring at the girl looking back at me. Hollow eyes. Pale skin. I didn’t recognize her.But I still had a little fire left in me.I brushed my hair, applied the foundation to hide the exhaustion, and dusted on the blush like war paint. Red lips.Downstairs, Chloe was pacing again, talking to someone on the phone. I caught snippets.“Emily, it’s Chloe… Yes, it’s bad… She’s really lost it this time. Can you come over?”I heard her sigh, then her voice dropped into a mutter. “She’s really gone. This woman is acting like she’s in some twisted Luna fairytale.”Maybe I was. But it was my fairytale—and I had to see it through to the end.Even if it ended in ashes.Chapter 4: Crumbling CourageFiona’s POVThe taxi pulled away, and I stood there on the curb, staring up at the building like it might swallow me whole.Alpha Dorian’s apartment complex hadn’t changed—it was still the same clean brick facade with its wrought-iron balcony and glossy windows. But today, it loomed. The place used to feel warm to me, like a second den. Now it was a fortress, and I was an outsider trespassing.I clutched my bag tighter, trying to stop the shaking in my hands. My wolf paced restlessly inside me, whining, uncertain. She didn’t want to be here either.But I had to do this. For our pup. For me.I walked in slowly, each step echoing down the stairwell like the tick of a countdown. The smell of the building brought it all back—the way Dorian’s arms had once felt around me, the way he used to whisper my name like it meant something. Moon, I wanted to forget.But I couldn’t.By the time I reached the door, I could hear them laughing inside. Her laugh. My stomach turned.I knocked, soft at first. Then again, louder, as the panic rose in my chest. My knuckles were pale against the wood.The door opened, and there he was—Alpha Dorian. Still beautiful. Still cold. His eyes flicked over me, and I saw it: surprise, followed by a frost that settled on his face like winter had moved in behind his eyes.I didn’t even get a word out before my gaze darted over his shoulder. There she was.Cecilia.Her face twisted the second she saw me. She stood slowly, hand protectively curled over her stomach.No. No, no, no.My eyes dropped to the swell beneath her palm, almost the same size as mine.She was pregnant.My heart cracked wide open. The betrayal hit me like a blade. She was carrying his pup too.“What the hell are you doing here?” she barked, already snarling. Her voice was acid, and she was enjoying this. I could see it in the way her lips curled, the fire in her smug eyes.I didn’t answer. Couldn’t. I just looked at her, then at Dorian. His jaw was tight, his scent unreadable.“Fiona,” he said, stepping forward. “You shouldn’t have come.”I tried to speak. The words came out shaky. “I just… I needed to talk. About the pup. About us.”“There is no ‘us,’” he snapped.Just like that. Like we never mattered.Behind him, I saw her parents. I hadn’t even realized they were there. Cecilia’s mother sat like a queen on a throne, looking at me like I’d dragged mud through her perfect little pack gathering.Gods, this was a setup.“You can’t just show up here and think you can mess things up,” Cecilia spat. “Dorian’s moved on. And you should too.”Tears burned behind my eyes, but I didn’t let them fall. Not yet.“I’m not here to mess anything up,” I said, my voice trembling. “The doctor said—”“I don’t care what the doctor said,” Dorian cut in, voice cold. “It’s not my problem anymore. You need to deal with your own mess.”My wolf whimpered inside me, wounded.I took a shaky breath, tried to hold my ground, even though every word they flung at me hit like claws.“You’ve got some nerve,” Cecilia sneered. “Showing up like a stray. You think your little sob story’s gonna change anything? Dorian never wanted you. He was just too nice to say it.”I flinched. That one cut deep.But I stood tall. “I’m not here to beg,” I said, though my voice betrayed me with a tremor. “He has a right to know—”“To know what?” she snapped, stepping closer like a wolf circling prey. “That you can’t handle rejection? That you can’t face reality? Look at you. You’re pathetic.”Cecilia’s mother finally rose from the couch. Her face twisted like she’d smelled something rotten.“I never understood what Dorian saw in you,” she said, her voice sharp as broken glass. “You’re a gold-digging tramp. I told him from the beginning you were trouble. Now you’re here flaunting that bastard child like it means something. Disgusting.”I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My cheeks burned, and I felt the blood pounding in my ears.“I’m not here to cause trouble,” I whispered.But it didn’t matter.Cecilia shoved me, hard. “You are the trouble,” she snapped. “You’re a leech. Do us a favor and crawl back into the gutter where you came from.”I stumbled, barely catching myself on the arm of a chair. My wolf growled softly inside, but she was tired. We both were.“Don’t you get it?” her mother hissed, and shoved me again. “You weren’t ever part of this family. You’re just trash he outgrew.”Her hand slammed into my shoulder, and I slipped.Everything slowed. My foot caught the carpet. The room tilted.Then I fell.My belly hit the hardwood with a sickening thud, and all the air left my lungs.Pain flared, sharp and electric. My hands instinctively cradled my stomach. My heart screamed, my wolf howled inside me.I didn’t care about pride anymore. Or Dorian. Or even Cecilia.All I could think was: please, Moon Goddess, not the baby.Pain tore through my stomach like claws raking from the inside. I gasped and curled around my bump, my knees barely holding me upright as I fought for breath. Tears blurred my vision—some from the pain, but most from the cruelty I’d just endured.I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe him.Alpha Dorian just stood there, staring at me like I was nothing more than a stain on his floor. My mate. My fated mate. The one who once ran his fingers through my hair and told me I was his future.Now he looked at me like I was dirt. Like I wasn’t even worth lifting a finger for.Cecilia let out a sharp laugh that cut through the room like broken glass. “Look at you,” she sneered, “on the floor where you belong.”She circled me like a predator, her voice loud and mocking. “Crawling like the stray mutt you are. How many times do I have to tell you—you’re not wanted.”My hands trembled as I tried to push myself upright, my arms weak, my core screaming with pain. The baby. Goddess, please let the baby be okay.I had barely gotten to my knees when Cecilia’s foot rammed into my side.The impact sent me crashing back down.“You’re pathetic,” she hissed above me. “Dorian never wanted you. Not your pup. Not anything. You’re a damn mistake.”I could taste blood in my mouth from the fall, but I still looked up—still hoping. Dorian didn’t move. Didn’t even flinch.He just turned away.“I told you to leave,” he said, without even looking at me. His voice was flat. Unbothered. “Don’t make me say it again.”Cecilia’s mother stepped beside her daughter, arms crossed, her face twisted with disdain. “You should’ve known your place, Fiona,” she spat. “You’ll never be Luna. You’re barely even pack.”I forced myself to breathe. To blink. To get up.My bones ached, and my wolf whimpered inside me, furious and humiliated. I cradled my belly and bit back a sob.No one helped me. Not one damn soul in that room moved.And I realized then—I was done begging.“You’ll regret this,” I rasped, my voice low but full of something new. Not desperation. Not pain.Conviction.“All of you will.”I turned, dragging my body toward the door, my legs shaky, the pain in my stomach sharp and hot. Cecilia’s shrill laughter echoed behind me as I limped down the stairs. But I didn’t look back.I couldn’t afford to.I’d made a vow in that moment, silent and fierce.They’d cast me aside like a rogue. Like a mistake.They were going to learn just how wrong they were.---The sky had turned a soft, dusky gray by the time I made it to Chloe’s front porch. I was shaking. Bleeding inside. Not just physically—soul deep.Chloe’s scent reached me first. Warm lavender, pine, and cinnamon. Comfort.I opened the door and stepped inside. She was sprawled on her couch, surrounded by snacks, her laptop open with her latest binge playing on low volume.The second she looked up, her eyes locked on my face, and she froze.“Oh. My. God.” Her mouth dropped open, and I saw it—the split-second flash of that I told you so look.Then her smile flickered.And vanished.I didn’t even get to sit down before it all came crashing out. My breath hitched, and the sob burst from me so violently, I startled us both. I dropped my bag and sank onto the nearest chair, hands pressed to my face as the tears streamed freely.“I-I thought he’d…” I couldn’t even finish.“Fiona,” Chloe whispered, already on her feet.She was beside me in an instant, pulling me into her arms like a mother wolf shielding her pup. “Oh, honey… Moon above. What did they do to you?”I couldn’t speak. I just clung to her and cried like my heart was breaking—because it was.She rubbed my back, rocking me gently, murmuring soft things in my ear that didn’t even register. Not really.But her warmth, her scent, the feel of her arms around me—it grounded me. It reminded me I wasn’t entirely alone.“I didn’t mean to laugh,” she said into my hair. “I was being an idiot. I’m so sorry. I should’ve gone with you. I should’ve never let you face them alone.”I shook my head. “You were right,” I whispered, my voice raw. “You were right about all of it.”She pulled back just enough to look at me, brushing the tears from my cheeks. “That doesn’t matter right now. What matters is you—and your baby. We need to get you checked, make sure everything’s okay.”I nodded slowly.But deep down, something in me had shifted.This wasn’t just heartbreak anymore.It was war.And I was done letting people walk all over me like I was some weak little she-wolf begging for scraps.My pup deserved better.And I was going to burn down the whole damn pack if that’s what it took to protect them.

She's got a great voice, writes some decent songs, and can play a few instruments. The problem is, she's also incredibly passive about pursuing it.

For the past five years, she's been working a part-time job that just covers her rent, and she spends most of her free time at home. She rarely goes to open mic nights, never tries to network with other musicians, hasn't seriously recorded a demo, and her social media presence for her music is basically non-existent. Her main strategy seems to be just... waiting. She's convinced that if she's ""good enough,"" someone important will just discover her online or stumble upon her at a random coffee shop.

She'll often complain to me about how frustrating it is that she hasn't had her ""big break"" yet, or how unfair it is that other, less talented people seem to be getting opportunities. She'll point to artists who ""made it big overnight"" (conveniently ignoring the years of grind they put in) and say, ""Why isn't that happening for me?""

Yesterday, she was particularly down about it. She was scrolling through Instagram, seeing some new artist signing a record deal, and she sighed, ""I wish someone would just find me and offer me a contract. It's so unfair that I'm still stuck here.""

I finally said, ""Maya, you can't expect a 'big break' to just fall into your lap if you're not putting yourself out there. You rarely perform, you don't connect with people in the industry, and you haven't put in the effort to create a professional product. You're waiting to be discovered from your couch, and that's just not how it works. You have to *make* your own breaks.""

She got really quiet, then just shut down, saying I was being harsh and didn't understand how hard it was. Now she's barely responding to my messages.

1m2gn62,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m2gn62/i_cant_stop_smiling/,I can't stop smiling,"It started as a clinical suggestion. My therapist, Dr. Adler, had this theory he was excited about. “Facial feedback,” he called it. The idea that the physical act of smiling, even a fake one, could influence the brain’s chemistry. Trick the body and the mind follows. I was skeptical, but that’s nothing new. I’ve been in therapy for years and most things don’t stick. He gave me a small mirror with a smooth black frame and told me to spend five minutes each morning smiling at myself. Not a fake one, he said. A gentle, sustained smile. Just enough to signal safety to the nervous system.

I felt like an idiot the first few times I tried it. You don’t realize how unnatural a smile feels when there’s no emotion behind it. The corners of my mouth quivered from the strain. My jaw ached. Still, I did it. Five minutes each morning, like a mechanical ritual.

By the end of the first week, I noticed the smile showing up on its own. I’d be making coffee or walking past a reflective surface, and I’d catch myself already grinning with no awareness of when it started. It didn’t even feel good. Just present. Like something I’d put on and forgotten to remove.

I mentioned it to Dr. Adler. He nodded, pleased. The brain’s remembering how to connect the signal with the feeling, he said. That’s a good sign.

I wanted to trust him. I’d tried everything else and this, however strange, was simple. Passive. No pills, no confronting childhood trauma, no breathing through panic attacks. Just a smile.

So I kept going.

Then something shifted.

I was on a video call for work, pretending to listen while someone explained the new process for vendor onboarding, when a colleague messaged me privately. “You okay? You look… really happy.” I typed back some joke about finally understanding spreadsheets. But afterward, I opened my webcam preview and stared.

I was smiling. Too wide. The kind of smile that shouldn’t last more than a few seconds before slipping into discomfort. My eyes were dead, but my face was stretched with something not quite joy.

I tried relaxing my face. The muscles trembled but refused. It was like trying to lower your arm after holding it out too long. It just stayed in place, numb and rigid. I had to push my cheeks down with both hands and even then, the relief only lasted a few seconds.

After that, it got worse. The smile stopped waiting for permission. It arrived when I woke up. It lingered after crying. I’d find myself standing in the hallway, unaware of how long I’d been there, grinning at nothing. I wasn’t just smiling anymore. I was being smiled.

Sleep became strange. I’d wake up with bite marks on the inside of my mouth. My lips were often split at the corners, blood dried in tiny spiderweb cracks. I set up my phone camera on the nightstand to watch myself overnight. Most of the footage was unremarkable, just me tossing and turning, breathing heavily.

But at 3:46 a.m., without warning, I would go still. My body would straighten. My lips would curl up like puppet strings had just been yanked.

And then I would speak.

The first night I whispered something I couldn’t make out. The next night the audio was clearer. I remember now. I remember your face.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was familiar somehow, like an impression of me made by someone who had never quite heard a human speak. Soft, too smooth, like breath over glass.

I showed the footage to Dr. Adler. He didn’t flinch. He watched it all, paused it, rewound a few seconds, then turned off the screen.

Some part of you is trying to communicate, he said. It’s not unusual for the subconscious to manifest through ritual. Repetition breeds openings.

I asked what that meant and he smiled. Not kindly. Flatly. As if he’d been waiting for this part. As if it always ended up here.

You should continue, he said.

I haven’t seen him since. His office is empty. His name is no longer on the directory. There’s no record of his license with the state board. Just one blurry photograph on a university archive, and in it, he’s smiling. But his teeth are blurred, as if the image couldn’t hold them clearly, as if they didn’t belong to him.

The mirror he gave me doesn’t reflect me anymore. It reflects the room behind me, slightly off, slightly wrong. Things are always a bit out of place. The shadow under the chair is too thick. The hallway seems deeper than it is. Sometimes I see a shape that shouldn’t be there. Sometimes the reflection smiles first.

I avoid looking at it now, but the smile remains. It stretches without muscle. It holds without tension. When I speak, it’s behind every word. When I eat, I feel it under the chewing. When I’m alone, I feel something else trying to wear it with me.

I think I was supposed to stop. I think the five minutes weren’t just a limit but a boundary. A safeguard. And I broke it.

There’s pressure behind my eyes now. I can feel something unfolding under my skin like wet paper. I touch my cheeks and they don’t respond. I screamed into the sink this morning and watched the corners of my mouth hold steady, calm, serene.

I understand now. It isn’t a smile. It’s a wound shaped like one. A rupture that looks polite. I think something came through it.

And I think it likes the way I fit.

Tonight, I cut the muscles. Not all the way, just enough to stop it from pulling. I stood in front of the mirror and saw blood drip down over white teeth, and I thought it was finally over.

But in the reflection, I was still smiling.

And then it blinked.

I didn’t.

I'm Arron, 24, from the Northwest. First and foremost, I’m looking for a relationship. Something real, affectionate, and built on trust.  
I'm generally quiet, shy, and nerdy. I really enjoy anything technical or creative. I spend a lot of time messing around with programming projects, usually making small games or tools that never really go anywhere, but I enjoy the process.

I’m into gaming (mostly on PC), cooking, baking, and getting into new hobbies for a little while until I burn out on them. Sometimes it’s DIY stuff, sometimes it’s tech-related projects.

Personality-wise, I’m an INTP-T. Bit of an overthinker. I’m introverted and value time alone, but I want to share that time with someone I care about. I connect best with people who are laid-back but passionate about the things they enjoy.

**Appearance:**

In terms of appearance, I’m 6'1"", white, with a broad build and some fat. I have short hair, a beard, and blue eyes. I'm not slim, but I’m working on it. My one goal is to get visible abs. For full transparency, I have some loose skin from weight loss. I’d like to get it removed someday, but right now it’s just a reminder of how far I’ve come and the effort I’ve put in.

**About you:**

Please don’t feel like you need to tick every box here. This is just a rough idea of the kind of person I think I'd work well with. If you're interested, just message me - Even if this post is a year old, I'm always open to friends as well 🙂. I’ve tried to keep this freeform as opposed to a list of items where possible (These 2 are a must though).

* Age: 21-29
* Location: UK

Your preference for places to go are quiet and cosy: coffee shops, bookstores, museums or just spending time at home. I'm not opposed to clubs, I've never been to one (I just don't think I would like them?)

I’m naturally drawn to women who are confident and like taking the lead. I find connection, trust, and power exchange really fulfilling - There are some other personals that I have posted on my profile, if you are still interested.

If this post sparked any interest, I’d love to get to know you. Feel free to send me a message here, and I’m happy to move to another platform afterward if you’d prefer.",1,1752779891.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Just drop a comment and I’ll send the link in 10 minutes.","One of Celeste Adams’s students hadn’t turned in a single assignment all semester. So she docked her participation grade.

That afternoon, her desk was trashed by a group of people.

Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she’d stayed up grading.

Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke—but just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.

Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. “Don’t cry. I’ve already settled the socre for you. As long as I’m around, no one’s going to lay a finger on you.”

Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. “Thank you, Mr. Sullivan… If it weren’t for you, I’d be eaten alive at school. I don’t even know how to repay you.”

Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. “Then repay me with a kiss. Deal?”

Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.

“This is just a thank-you… It doesn’t mean I’m saying yes to you.” She whispered. “You’re married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.”

Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. “Okay. I’ll wait.”

Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.

...

She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, “Celeste, I’ll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.”

And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of “forever”?

Once Vanessa was gone—back to her dorm—Celeste finally walked up to Lucian’s car, her face pale.

Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.

When he saw her, he clearly froze. “Celeste?”

“Lucian Sullivan.” Her voice shook. “You and her… how long has this been going on?”

Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a smoke ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes—eyes designed to break hearts.

“Well, since you’ve found out, I won’t bother hiding it.” His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. “You only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime—the party's over.""

“I do love you, Celeste. But don’t expect me to love only you. That gets boring.”

“Vanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I’m intrigued. Don’t worry, I’m not planning to divorce you. When I’m done having fun, I’ll come back to you.”

Celeste felt her heart twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. “I can’t accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.”

A frown snapped onto Lucian’s face, his voice turning icy. “Stop overreacting. I’ve made myself clear. I’ll spend most of the rest of my life with you—as long as you…”

He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. “Behave. And stop bothering my girl.”

With that, he let go and walked away.

Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.

She’d heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy—men playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.

But she’d never thought Lucian would become one of them.

Because he had once loved her so deeply.

So deeply he’d insisted on marrying her—a nobody teacher’s daughter—even against the Sullivan family’s objections. So deeply he’d stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days…

On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.

Turns out, “the rest of his life” ended way sooner than she expected.

Celeste didn’t even remember how she got home.

She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.

When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her chest.

Her eyes flew open—she was suspended inside a massive glass tank, wrists shackled above her head, and the water level was steadily rising.

Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.

The firelight danced on his handsome profile—but none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.

“Lucian…!” she struggled, water splashing everywhere. “What are you doing?!”

“You went to Vanessa,” he said coldly. “Told her to stay away from me.”

The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. “So she deleted all my contacts.”

“This is your punishment. Remember this lesson.”

“I didn’t!” Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. “I never even saw her after I went home!”

“Still lying?” Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. “Increase the water.”

The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.

Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.

Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. “I told you—I love you. Just give me ten years, and I’ll come back.”

“But first, stop going after Vanessa.”

And with that, he turned and left.

“Lucian! Lucian—!”

Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.

The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.

On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes—

That school trip years ago, when she’d fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.

The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.

The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached…

But now, it had all gone up in smoke.

By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn’t even stand.

She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up—

Vanessa had updated her social feed.

“First time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~”

The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.

Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed—while tears fell onto the screen.

She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.

Lucian didn’t return until that night.

Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. “Let’s grab dinner. I’ll make it up to you, okay?”

He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. “It’s over now. I’m just gonna be with her for ten years. Don’t go looking for trouble again.”

Celeste looked up, calm. “Fine. But you need to sign something.”

She handed him a document. “A contract promising you’ll come back to the family after ten years.”

Lucian didn’t even glance at it before signing.

“Happy now?” He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.

Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. “Yeah. I’m happy.”

She was happy.

Because he hadn’t realized—what he signed wasn’t a promise to return.

It was a divorce agreement...",2,1752779862.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

In think we all know Moka Pot coffee is NOT espresso. It does not reach anywhere near 9 bars of pressure and other factors as well. The review kept comparing espresso to Moka pot coffee as well as viewing Moka pot coffee negatively, ie: **""I’d like to note that many of you don’t make your fake stovetop espresso to drink straight.""**  And this:  **""However, it’s often the case that your fake espresso tastes terrible. Most of the time, this is less to do with the brewing method and more about incorrect preparatory work""**. The point is, I drink the coffee from my Moka pot straight, no milk, no sugar. I taste really good coffee. The taste is as different as pour over is to aeropress is to drip is to French Press, et al. They're all just different. No need to disparage one method over another and most of all don't compare Moka pot coffee to espresso because it isn't! So, how do you drink your Moka pot coffee? Is it relegated to milk based drinks only because it is an inferior brewing method and makes inferior coffee? Maybe you just like milk based drinks which is great and very tasty.

1m2gkgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1m2gkgf/three_month_fire_update_21m_to_27m/,Three Month Fire Update; 2.1M to 2.7M,"Warning of incoming text wall. 

After much deliberation, at 42 years of age,  I left work three months ago with 2.1 million. This was after tariff announcements and a \~25% drop in the market. Since then, the market has rebounded and then some leaving me at 2.7 million but who really knows what the future will hold. I'm going to brain dump what I experienced and what I am thinking moving forward. 

Ego death. What I mean by ego death is the death of roundearththeory the blahblah engineer at blahblah company who worked on blah as a core component of my identity. It's not dead yet but I am letting go. When meeting new people and am inevitably asked what I do, I say I was in tech for a while but left and keep the conversation moving. If the conversation moves to my old career. So be it. If it doesn't. So be it. This is a vast minimization of what this part of my life was but it opens up room for all different types of discussion. I am learning I can still be a smart and clever person without leaning on career accolades. 

Mental and physical health. I am happy to say that I am better than ever. Upon leaving I scheduled basically every doctor and specialist appointment I could to baseline what my physical health is and figure out what I need to improve. In terms of mental health, escaping from the grind and expectation of the corporate life has been miraculous. I don't think working for a company is inherently toxic but my relationship with work was. I both excel at and absorb tremendous stress from my job because I am obsessive with it. The blade cuts both ways. Earlier in my career when I had less responsibility and had more stamina for the negative aspects of work this was manageable. This didn't scale well into the present and things became overwhelming for too long. This is something that I have begun to take a hard look at.

Personal relationships. I made the time and conjured the energy to mend important relationships. I made the time to be present with friends in different parts of the country. I made time for myself to be alone. In theory I could have done this while working but when I was pouring myself into my job, I didn't have the mental and emotional bandwidth to do this. This has probably been the single greatest thing that I have done in the past three months.      

Finances. When I originally left I had 2.1 million thanks to a big market downswing. People commented it wasn't enough. People commented it is enough. Intuitively we all know there isn't a correct answer as our circumstances are all unique. But I do know this; when you start looking at days, weeks, and months solely as currency, i.e. just one more year and I'll have X more dollars, you are in troubled water. You also need to think about what you would be giving up in that extra year in terms of mental and physical health, relationships, and the opportunity cost of having different experiences. 

What I do with my time. I can't say that every day is a paragon of happiness, productivity, or some other superlative. But, an interesting phenomena is that I am excited for each day. I'm excited for my morning coffee and brewing up what I am going to do. And I often find myself wishing days didn't end as soon as they do. My days involve reading for leisure, writing, exercise at the gym, listening to music, pursuing my hobby, and bullshitting with friends. Also, naps. A lot of those whenever I want. A simple trip to the bookstore on a Thursday morning is an amazing experience. There are no lines at the barista and there is an infinite amount of books to satisfy my curiosity. I'm not exactly sure if this is sustainable but I am affording myself this time to rest and simply be present with whatever it is I do.   

Moving forward. It's plain to see that this life is so blissfully devoid of stress. I've granted myself the space to catch up with many facets of life that I have neglected. But stress creates growth and inaction breeds atrophy. I think I am not afraid of the stress of hard work. My mind is already mobilizing and thinking of what I can do. I am, however, afraid of lacking agency over my precious and finite time and energy. I have the opportunity to return to my career and try forging a healthier relationship with my work. I also have the opportunity to continue riding into the sunset and continue pulling on this thread. I'm unsure of the path I take but I'm okay with the uncertainty. My decision won't be forced by need. Is it a copout to return to work after the song and dance of finally pulling the FIRE trigger? One of the beautiful aspects of ego death is that it works both ways. I am not defined by my career just as I am not defined by retirement. It's just one aspect of my life.

If you've read this much, thanks for sticking with it and giving me the opportunity to do a brain dump. It's been helpful to put my feelings into words.

1m2ggef,https://www.reddit.com/r/WristbandBros/comments/1m2ggef/why_silicone_wristbands_still_rule_for_nonprofit/,Why Silicone Wristbands Still Rule for Nonprofit Fundraising,"**Why Silicone Wristbands Still Rule for Nonprofit Fundraising**

Let’s be honest. In the world of fundraising, you have a million options. T shirts, tote bags, mugs, pens, and the ever present bake sale. But when it comes to value for your dollar, emotional connection, and long term visibility, there is one small but mighty contender that continues to shine:

[A custom silicone wristband.](https://preview.redd.it/1fcjx58d2hdf1.png?width=3573&format=png&auto=webp&s=26510ed47a5c2a7ac600b5090529125fc0a6c03f)

Yes, the silicone wristband. The one that took over the early 2000s like low rise jeans and flip phones. But unlike those fashion choices, thankfully, the silicone wristband is still going strong and for good reason. Especially for nonprofits, it offers something unique. A simple tool that builds unity, spreads awareness, and raises money without draining your budget.

Here is why this humble accessory should still be part of your nonprofit’s fundraising toolkit.

# 1. They Are Affordable. Really Affordable.

When you are running a nonprofit, every dollar matters. Whether you are building wells, rescuing dogs, or buying school supplies, you need fundraising tools that do not eat into your budget. Silicone wristbands are incredibly cost effective, especially when ordered in bulk.

That means you can sell them at a solid margin without asking people to fork over twenty dollars. You can hand them out for free at events and still stay within budget. You can even toss a few extras into donor packages just because. And in a world where coffee is 99 dollars a bean, affordability means something.

# 2. They Are Walking Billboards

Once someone slips on a wristband, they wear your cause. It is not a flyer they will toss or pen that runs out of ink two letters in. It is not buried in a drawer like that extra mug from the silent auction. It is right there, on their wrist, at the grocery store, at work, on the treadmill, and yes, even on awkward Zoom calls.

Every time someone glances down at it, or someone else asks about it, your message continues to live on. It starts conversations. It raises awareness. And if the design is sharp, it makes your cause look great at the same time.

# 3. They Are Super Customizable

Do not let the simplicity fool you. Wristbands are like the tofu of fundraising merchandise. They take on whatever flavor you give them.

Want to engrave your organization’s name and website? Easy. Prefer a bold call to action like Stand Up or Hope Lives? Go for it. You can go traditional with one color and classic debossed lettering, or mix it up with swirls, glow in the dark options, glitter, or even custom shaped bands.

Color choice matters too, especially for awareness campaigns. Pink for breast cancer. Purple for domestic violence. Green for mental health. The color alone can speak volumes and instantly connect people to your cause.

# 4. They Help People Feel Like They Belong

Wristbands are not just accessories. They are symbols. When someone wears one, it says I care about this. I am part of this. I believe in this cause.

That kind of belonging is powerful. Whether it is a community 5K, a candlelight vigil, or an online campaign, wristbands give people a way to feel connected to something larger than themselves.

And let’s be honest. In a world that often feels disconnected, that little circle of silicone goes a long way in building community.

# 5. They Work for All Ages

Wristbands have cross generational appeal. Kids love them. Teenagers collect them. Adults wear them. Even your great aunt will throw one on if it supports her favorite animal rescue.

Unlike T shirts that require exact sizing or hats that never fit quite right, wristbands are nearly universal. One size fits most. And people aren't tossing a fit if its a little loose. No dressing rooms, no guesswork. They are easy to put on, easy to mail, and they do not go out of style.

# 6. They Travel Well

If you are planning a fundraising campaign or awareness event, silicone wristbands are a dream. They are lightweight. They do not break. You can fit hundreds in a backpack. You can ship them in bulk without selling your soul to the postal service.

Perfect for events, direct mail, donor thank you kits, or volunteer swag. They will not arrive bent, melted, or leave leaking coffee. Try saying that about your average promotional mug.

# 7. They Make Fundraising Easier for Everyone

Not everyone wants to walk door to door selling raffle tickets or hit up their friends with donation requests. But offering someone a wristband in exchange for a few bucks? That is easy.

It lowers the pressure. It is not just asking for money. It is offering something tangible in return. That makes it easier for your volunteers, staff, and community members to get involved.

Set up a table at a local event. Offer wristbands as part of an online donation package. Drop a jar of them at the front desk with a sign that says Take One, Give What You Can. It all adds up.

# 8. They Last

Silicone wristbands are durable. They do not fray, shrink, or disintegrate. They survive showers, workouts, dishwashing shifts, and even toddlers.

That kind of longevity means your message lasts well beyond the campaign itself. It stays visible, relevant, and wearable for weeks, months, or even years.

# 9. They Just Work

At the end of the day, wristbands work. They are simple. They are meaningful. They give your supporters a way to take your mission with them. They help spread your message in everyday spaces, and they create a lasting connection between your cause and the people who care about it.

In a world full of noisy campaigns and short attention spans, the silicone wristband is refreshingly straightforward. No batteries. No app. No maintenance. Just a meaningful message wrapped around a wrist.

If you are planning your next nonprofit campaign and wondering what to offer, do not overlook the power of the silicone wristband. It might be small, but it gets the job done.

And that is what makes it a classic.

I've gotten in the habit of calling to ask for a welfare check when I see somebody seemingly asleep or passed out on the side of the road, but I don't think they typically come and they operator has started asking if I would be able to check to see their condition, so I've started to do that. 

I hope the day never comes that I find someone who it's too late for, but, perhaps someday it could save someone's life. Although so far they typically just been asleep or, on the nod I guess you would call it. 

3 weeks ago I saw a guy who had been panhandling near a freeway exit and it looks like he just fell asleep there. It was a pretty hot day so I wanted to make sure he was okay. 

I took him a couple of glasses of water and some cold brew they let me have at the Panera bread. Someone else had called the police and when I got over to my saw they were checking in on him so I just gave him the water and coffee and left. So that was all fine. 

But a couple of weeks ago down in Auburn I saw similar, a guy by the side of the freeway exit where someone would typically hang out asking for donations. Only this guy was just and laying there fully covered by what looked like a canvas painters tarp. Head and everything covered. 

It was an equally hot day so I figured I better at least check on him. Expecting the typical rousing someone from their sleep enough to get verbal confirmation that they are all right, but as I approached, the guy energetically pulled the blanket off his head and cheerfully greeted me. 

I asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine. I asked him if he needed some water or anything else, and he said in an upbeat tone, no, I'm good. What I could really use is some alcohol and a cigarette.

I chuckled and told him I couldn't help him in that department and went on my way. I really was concerned on that one because he was completely under the tarp in motionless, but I guess dude's doing okay.

He ended things, twice (other time was about 6 months ago). The second time, he told me not to contact him again. I haven’t. But I miss him so much it physically hurts some days.

The strangest part is… my life is actually getting better. I’m starting grad school this fall. I adopted a cat. I’ve been biking again, even got a new bike which I know he would be so excited about. I feel more stable and grounded. I’m doing things I probably wouldn’t have done if we’d stayed together. And yet, I keep thinking: what if we could have made it work now?

We were planning to move together across the country. He got an opportunity, and I was going to go with him. But I hesitated. I was afraid of giving up my life, my friends, my hobbies, and possibly motherhood. It felt like too much to sacrifice for someone whose life looked so different from mine. But now, it all feels wrong. Now that my own life is becoming more certain, I feel like we could’ve woven our lives together, but previously I didn’t know how to do it without losing myself.

He said I could be his person. And I believed him. But we ended because of uncertainty, and the fact that he didn’t want kids an I did. I told him I was working on figuring out if kids were something I could give up, and he ended it before we even tried.

I went on a date recently with someone new. He didn’t even offer to pay for my coffee. And that one small thing made me realize how incredibly thoughtful and giving my ex was. He would’ve never let me pay. He’d fix my bike, make me breakfast, buy snacks I liked, take on chores just to make my life easier. He’d listen. He’d show up. He wanted to build a whole life with me. He wanted me to come with him. And now, I just feel so heartbroken that something that deep still wasn’t enough.

I keep wondering if I made a mistake. I’m realizing I might not even want kids after all. That maybe we were more compatible than I knew at the time. But I didn’t have that clarity when it mattered. And now he’s gone.

I keep hoping he’ll reach out. But he told me not to contact him. I’m terrified of reaching out just to be ignored or rejected again.

I just miss him. I miss feeling safe. What do I do?",2,1752779135.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I sincerely apologize for the delay I recently started a new job so things have been little more chaotic for me the usual but I am bk to continue my saga. 

By this point I'd been living with Basement Beard for about 2 weeks,  most of my days consisted of hangout with Basement Beard's mom and the dogs, watching movies or youtube and filling out paperwork to change my mailing address and whatnot. For most of the traveling we would do consisted of us walking across the street to the end the of the block to the corner store mostly to get cigarettes for his mom. Again not originally from the city, these corner stores were still alittle strange to me. Selling everything from cigarettes to snacks, to small pet food products, hair care products and coffee. Another thing about these corner stores is that they are FRICKGEN everywhere. All the same and yet different and always open. 

By this time I was also futilely Trying to clean Basement Beard's house but never making alot of progress. I absolutely refused to clean up after the dogs and when ever I asked why we don't let them out in the backyard I was asked where would the kids play? (This was around October at this point. Too cold and starting to snow so they wouldn't play outside anyway.) Every day id come up stairs there was always dog crap on the floor and no one would ever clean it up until they absolutely had too. How anyone could eat anything from this kitchen I will never understand. Something with dusting or anything else the only jobs that would get done was trash that was it.

Plus getting no help from anyone else. I decided the better thing to do was not to be there. Or to stay down stairs as much as possible. I was vary depressed and never able to be alone alot of the time which also really sucked. Luckily I recently remembered that the local library wasn't far so I asked Basement Beard if we could walk there sometime. His first response was him looking at me strangely and asked ""what? Why would you ever wanna go there?"" I explained that I can see about trying to find a job on the computers there. Once, I had him show me all around his area so I could start getting my barrings about 3 blocks in every direction. About another 3 weeks later I could at least start walking to stores and stuff by myself. The library seemed to be Basement Beard's kyrptonite everytime I said I going he would just be watching something dumb on TV with his mom and say ""OK."" or ""see ya later."" At least at the library I could be alone.

Shopping was the absolute worst tho. We would have to either take a cab to the grocery store or catch the bus. It took 2-3 buggies of groceries to feed this whole household and there was never anything that could make a whole dinner that wasn't frozen or pre-made no veggies or fruit either. Then we would have to squeeze into a cab with everything to get it all back to house, unload, bring into the house and put it all away. This act in its self was an Olympic event and would happen twice amounth. I know this post wasn't vary eventful but i had some time to kill and this is wat I decided to do lol. Until next time.

1m2g8sp,https://i.redd.it/2bcineu2ghdf1.jpeg,The Rib That Broke Us,"Help!! Looking for a free link

Chapter 1
The airport lounge.
Eloise Claire scrolled through her phone out of boredom. Suddenly, a video title caught her eye. ""What's the Most Willingly You've Ever Done for an Ex You Couldn't Forget?""
Curious, she tapped it open. The screen was pitch black, but as soon as a familiar voice came through, she froze.
""My ex was into beauty. She wanted a nose job,"" the man said with a light chuckle, like he was remembering something sweet. ""But she was scared of the pain, so she ended up using my rib.""
Someone in the video whistled. ""What's that saying again? A woman is made from a man's rib, right? Damn, Leon, that's real love right there!""
The man just laughed and didn't deny it.
The moment she heard the name Leon, her pupils contracted slightly. She was almost certain that it was Leon Brunner—her fiancé.
His voice continued, and she unconsciously held her breath.
""She was delicate and wouldn't do a thing herself. I even put on her socks for her.
""Oh—and when we broke up, she swore she'd kill herself if I ever moved on. Said she'd wait for me the rest of her life.""
The guys laughed louder, teasing him. ""Come on, you're saying you never had any feelings for Eloise?""
The second her name came up, her hands clenched. Sweat gathered in her palms.
""Just a thing,"" Leon said, his voice low, almost careless. ""Nothing worth taking seriously.""
The words landed like ice water. Every illusion shattered. A numb chill spread up her spine, and her mind went blank.
""Leon, I'm posting this,"" someone joked.
""Go ahead,"" he said coldly.
""You're not scared your fiancée will see it and flip?""
""She's just a toy. I've played long enough. Now that my girl's back, I won't let her get hurt again.""
Three years. And she was just a toy to him!
A sharp pain stabbed through her chest. She couldn't breathe.
She sat down, hugging herself tight, as if that could hold her together. The departure lounge buzzed with people, yet no one seemed to notice the girl on the floor—someone clearly out of place.
Until a young woman finally spotted her. She rushed over and said worriedly, ""Are you okay? Low blood sugar? I've got candy.""
But when Eloise looked up, her pretty face was soaked with tears. A complete wreck.
The sweet-faced young woman froze, a little startled. ""Why are you crying?"" she asked softly.
Eloise shook her head. She didn't have the strength to answer. The young woman hesitated, then gently pried open Eloise's palm and placed a piece of candy in it.
""Sugar helps with the mood,"" she said, then walked away.
Eloise popped the candy into her mouth with trembling fingers. No sweetness. Only bitterness, spreading across her tongue.
The boarding call echoed overhead. She stood and walked toward the gate, step by step. Even after settling into her seat, the tears wouldn't stop. Her vision stayed fogged, her eyes burning.
Somewhere in that blur, she saw him again. The first time she met Leon.
Back then, her family life was a wreck. She'd spiraled into depression, deep and consuming. Self-destructive thoughts came often. Too often.
She'd gone up to rooftops more than once. The last time, she stood at the edge, and a man appeared out of nowhere, tall and shadowed, his face obscured in the dark. He looked at her foot hovering on the ledge and swore under his breath. ""Fuck!""
Just as she closed her eyes and leaned forward, arms numb, he grabbed her from behind and yanked her back. That time, she saw his face clearly.
Sharp jawline and charming eyes. Lips pressed into a thin, unhappy line. He smelled faintly of alcohol.
""Trying to die?"" he snapped, voice sharp, eyes cold—like he was looking at a lunatic.
But Eloise only smiled—a sudden, bright, unruly smile. For the first time in a long while, something rippled in her still, dead heart.
She didn't want to die anymore.
Looking up at the tall, handsome stranger, she held out her hand. ""I'm Eloise. Wanna date?""
The man looked at her with interest, his eyes almost like he was seeing someone else through her. ""Sure.""
Just like that, two strangers became lovers.
Leon took her to one therapist after another. He handled her emotions like glass—carefully, patiently. She changed. She laughed again.
When she mumbled about craving pulled pork at midnight, he'd drive across half the city to get it; When she cried from anxiety in the middle of the night, he held her tight, staying awake until morning just to keep her steady.
She'd once believed he loved her—the way she loved him. But now, everything told her otherwise.
It had all been a dream. A dream so fragile and broken, no piece could fit back together.
She wiped her tears and took out her phone. The plane hadn't taken off yet. She dialed the number.
""I'll go through with the engagement,"" she said.
Chapter 2
Eloise was the illegitimate daughter of the Claire family in California. Her mother had once been the patriarch's first love. But under family pressure, he'd married a more ""suitable"" woman, even though her mother was already pregnant at the time.
Before she died, Eloise's mother made him promise to take care of her. Eloise still remembered how stunned and small she felt the first time she saw Claire's manor.
It looked like a palace. A place that had trapped her mother—and now, trapped her too.
No one in the Claire family liked her. Even the maids called her a bastard. Yvonne Claire, the daughter of the official wife, had bullied her since childhood.
Later, Eloise's father forced her into an arranged marriage with the son of the Bronner family—a man rumored to be hideously ugly—just to keep Yvonne from being married off instead.
She stared at the WhatsApp contact her father sent her, fingers trembling slightly. Then she steeled herself and tapped ""Add to contact.""
Leon was possessive and controlling. Even if he didn't love her, he wouldn't let her go. The only way out was to marry someone else.
She typed, ""Hi, I'm Eloise.""
No reply. She blinked, confused, then felt a light tap on her shoulder.
""Hey!""
She turned. It was the same sweet-faced young woman from the airport. Pale, too pale—like illness clung to her skin.
""I'm Aurelie. What's your name?""
""Eloise.""
""Don't be sad, okay? Everything passes eventually. I've been through a lot too, and I got through it.""
Eloise's anxious heart settled a little. She stared out the window, dazed, watching the clouds drift by. Today was Leon's birthday. She'd traveled back overnight from another state just to celebrate with him. She hadn't slept at all.
But earlier, he'd told her he didn't have time to pick her up. Her thumb rubbed absently along the edge of her phone as she followed the crowd off the plane.
Then—a voice. It sounded too familiar.
""Ellie.""
Eloise's head snapped up. Not far ahead, Leon stood in a black suit, waving at Aurelie Berna. His face was soft, and his gaze was warm, resembling still water in the sun.
Eloise's heart dropped. Her hand clenched tightly around the hem of her dress. ""Didn't he say he didn't have time?"" she thought.
As Eloise stood frozen, Leon—like he sensed something—suddenly looked in her direction. The moment he saw her, his brows drew together in a faint frown.
""Come here, Eloise."" His tone left no room for argument, and she forced herself forward.
The moment Aurelie saw her, she blinked in surprise, then broke into a big, bright smile. ""Oh, it's you! You must be Leon's girlfriend, right?""
Eloise stared at her for a second. ""And you're...""
Before Leon could answer, Aurelie jumped in. ""I'm his cousin.""
Leon frowned but didn't say anything.
When they got to the car, Aurelie offered to take the back seat. Eloise nodded and was just about to climb into the passenger seat when Leon stopped her.
""Sit in the back. Ellie's not feeling well. It's uncomfortable back there.""
He looked serious and calm, like it was nothing. Eloise hesitated, then slowly stepped back and didn't say a word. But the bitter taste in her mouth wouldn't fade.
She got carsick easily, and Leon knew that. In their three years together, she had never once sat in the back seat.
The tension thickened. Aurelie quickly tried to ease it, chirping about games they could play at the birthday dinner later.
Eloise just sat there, silent.
Leon frowned again, glancing over at her. ""What's with you today? Why are you being so off?""
A sharp pain stabbed through her chest, like someone had rammed a knife right in. He knew she didn't like crowds. He'd always known...
Outside the window, rain started to fall. Typical southern weather—changing in a blink.
Then her phone rang. It was her father. ""Elle, clear out your things from the room. The new maid needs a place to stay.""
The Claire's manor had more rooms than anyone could count. And they couldn't spare even one?
Silence filled the car. Stifling. Eloise felt heat rising in her cheeks, like someone had slapped her hard.
She closed her eyes. Exhausted.
""I want to get out.""
Chapter 3
Leon didn't stop. ""No time to take you back. The party's starting. Ellie's been abroad for years—everyone's excited to see her.""
Eloise's nails dug into her palms. Her eyes burned. The tears almost fell, but she tilted her head back and swallowed them down.
Her mother's keepsakes were still at Claire's manor. If she didn't get them soon, they'd probably toss them out.
""No need to take me. Stop the car.""
Leon kept driving. Aurelie frowned and lightly tapped his arm, her voice sweet as syrup. ""Stop the car. She looks like she's in a rush. Must be important. Aren't you her boyfriend? Try acting like it.""
The air went still, and the car pulled over immediately.
Eloise gave Leon a long look, then turned to Aurelie and said softly, ""Thanks.""
Aurelie smiled, sugar-sweet. ""Don't mention it. There should be an umbrella in the trunk.""
Eloise blinked, then shook her head. She opened the door with a pale, graceful hand.
The moment she stepped out, the car sped off like it was fleeing a curse.
She let out a bitter laugh. Three years of dating, and she never even knew he kept an umbrella in the car.
The rain hit hard, cold, and cutting. She kicked off her heels and walked barefoot all the way back to Claire's manor.
Lights blazed inside the house. Glass shattered somewhere. She rushed in too fast. A sharp, stinging shot through her foot—glass had sliced it open. She flinched.
The maids stood stiffly in the yard, eyes cold and judgmental. She ignored them until she saw what was on the floor. Her eyes snapped wide.
A photo frame that was cracked beyond saving. Inside the frame was a picture of a beautiful woman holding a girl's hand, which was now soaked and smeared with water.
Her chest ached. Her heels slipped from her hand, landing with a dull thud. She knelt and picked up the frame, her fingers trembling over the ruined photo.
""Mom..."" Her whisper broke the silence.
""Well, isn't this Eloise, the first daughter of the Claire family? What happened to you? I thought you landed the Brunner family heir. Why do you still look like a wreck?""
A sharp, arrogant voice rang out. Eloise looked up and locked eyes with the woman descending the stairs. Hatred flared in her gaze.
Her face was pale. She spoke through clenched teeth, ""Yvonne, whatever you've got to say, say it to me. This was the last thing my mom left me.""
Yvonne let out a mocking laugh like she'd just heard the world's best joke.
""And? That doesn't make it special. She's not my mom."" She examined her freshly manicured nails, her voice full of scorn.
""Your precious Leon just proposed to his ex at the birthday party. And you're here crying over your mommy?""
Then Yvonne tossed her phone toward Eloise, the screen already lit up with a paused video. The man in the video was Leon. And the woman standing across from him... was Aurelie.
Eloise's pupils shrank. Her ankle throbbed, the pain flaring up. Her eyes turned red, and the tears were close.
Seeing her go pale, Yvonne smiled with satisfaction. She took her phone from Eloise's hand and put it away. ""Heard you finally agreed to that arranged marriage with Dad, huh? Should've done it earlier. Sure, Mr. Bronner is ugly, but he's loaded. Just like your gold-digging mom—both of you love money.""
Yvonne lounged on the couch like a queen tossing scraps. ""Dad says the wedding's in 20 days.""
Eloise's fingers curled into fists. She was about to snap—when Yvonne suddenly added with a grin, ""Oh, and by the way—Leon's ex said no.""
Chapter 4
Eloise didn't even know how she made it back to the apartment. One hand clutched her heels, and the other held the photo tight to her chest. Still, it got soaked. The woman's beautiful face blurred even more.
She collapsed to the cold floor and broke down. Cried hard. She wiped the photo again and again, but her tears kept falling, smudging everything. Her sobs turned ragged. She lay there, gasping.
Then, a knock at the door. The next second, a pair of black leather shoes stepped into view.
Leon stood there, staring at her curled up on the floor. His brow twitched. He picked her up and set her on the couch, his face full of frustrated pity.
""I just didn't take you to Claire's manor. Was that really such a big deal?""
Was it?
Right then, Eloise saw it clearly. The man she loved wasn't the same anymore and hadn't been for a long time.
Before she left Claire's manor, she heard the whole story. Leon and Aurelie were a perfect match. Talented guy—beautiful girl. Everyone used to envy them. No one knew why they broke up.
Back then, they were California's golden couple. Aurelie would mention some tiny little thing, and Leon would remember it like scripture.
She looked at the man in front of her and gave a bitter smile. So this is what it feels like—when someone doesn't love you. It's painfully obvious.
Even if he'd treated her well these past three years, she could still tell—he was looking through her, missing someone else.
She pulled away from his arms, her voice calm, distant. ""It's a big deal.""
Leon yanked at his tie, annoyed and drained.
""It's just something small."" Then he got up and left. The door slammed behind him. Loud. Final.
Eloise flinched. A second later, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Yvonne. A photo. Her tears slipped out again and hit the screen. Leon was standing outside Aurelie's place. Arms full of roses. But Aurelie never came down.
That night, Eloise barely slept a wink.
This apartment had been a gift from Leon. He said it was meant to be her safety net. But Eloise didn't want it anymore. She took the deed to the property office and had the name changed back to Leon's.
""I'll return everything you gave me,"" she thought.
Staring out at the green trees beyond the window, she felt herself drift. It had been a long time since she'd really looked at the world outside.
Suddenly, her phone buzzed—a message from Aurelie. After a long pause, Eloise replied to it.
Aurelie asked to meet at a café. When Eloise arrived, Aurelie was already seated, smiling brightly the moment she walked in. ""Hey, Elle! Want something to drink?""
Eloise froze for half a second, then walked over slowly and pulled out the chair. It had been so long since anyone called her that. To most, she was just ""Eloise."" To the Claire family, she was ""the bastard daughter."" And only Leon used to call her ""Elle.""
Now she realized—even that had probably just been his way of remembering Aurelie.
""Whatever's fine.""
Maybe it was the exhaustion on her face or the silence that hung between them, but Aurelie let out a quiet sigh.
""Elle, I'm sorry.""
Chapter 5
Eloise froze, staring at Aurelie with confusion clouding her eyes.
Aurelie stirred her coffee slowly, her expression dimming.
""I have a congenital heart condition,"" she said quietly. ""I won't live past 25. My birthday's in less than two weeks.""
The words hit like a bomb. Eloise's hand clenched tightly around the hem of her dress. She didn't understand why Aurelie was telling her this.
""I lied to you that day. I'm not Leon's cousin,"" Aurelie went on. ""We were once a couple. But when I went abroad for treatment, I broke up with him.""
Eloise sat in silence, letting the words sink in. She hadn't known any of this.
""Later, I heard he wasn't doing well, so I faked a suicide attempt to force him to move on. Then I heard he was with you. I was genuinely happy for you both.
""I don't have much time left. All I wanted was for you two to be happy. But I know I've shaken things up, and for that, I'm sorry. I know my presence has made your life harder.""
Eloise didn't speak right away. Her mind flicked back to the airport—to the moment she'd collapsed in tears, to that little piece of candy Aurelie had handed her. Looking back, none of it had ever really been black or white.
Finally, Eloise looked up. Her gaze was calm as she said, ""I forgive you.""
Aurelie's eyes lit up. She smiled, wide and radiant.
Then chaos exploded. A glass shattered nearby—someone had dropped it, maybe thrown it—and the sound cracked through the café like a gunshot. Aurelie's smile faded instantly. Her face drained of color as she clutched at her chest, fingers digging in.
Eloise bolted up and rushed to her side. ""Aurelie! Are you okay? Aurelie!""
Her lips were pale, her body shaking. She baely managed to whisper, ""The meds... In my bag...""
And then she collapsed.
Everything around them turned into noise—voices, footsteps, panic—but all Eloise could hear was her own pounding heartbeat. Her hands trembled as she dug into Aurelie's bag and pulled out the bottle of pills.
Just as she was about to give her the medication, someone slammed into her from the side—hard. She crashed to the floor, the impact driving glass into her palms. Blood pooled fast.
She looked up, dazed. It was Leon standing there. His glare was ice cold, his voice ragged and sharp.
""I never thought you could be this cruel. Yeah, I love her. And if anything happens to her, I'll stay by her side for the rest of my life. Is that what you wanted?
""If Aurelie dies, I'll never forgive you."" Every word was a knife, slicing through her without mercy.
Eloise stared at him, stunned, her lips trembling as she tried to speak and explain, ""I didn't...""
But Leon didn't give her a chance to speak—he scooped Aurelie into his arms and ran out without a word.
Everyone else just stared, pointing, whispering like spectators at a show.
Eloise used to fear that kind of attention. Now, she felt nothing. Just numb.
She slowly got to her feet, blood dripping steadily from her torn palms. She didn't look at anyone, didn't care. Step by step, she walked out of the café and hailed a cab to the hospital.
After the doctor finished dressing her wounds, he reminded her, ""Keep it dry for a week."" She nodded.
When she returned to her apartment, she wasn't alone.
Leon was on the couch, long legs crossed, face unreadable. His eyes flicked to her, filled with something she couldn't place.
""What's going on?"" he asked. Eloise followed his gaze. The property deed. Her chest tightened.
""I don't like this place anymore."" Something in her voice hit him in a strange way. This was the first gift he ever gave her. She'd always taken such good care of it, made it feel like home.
Now she didn't like it. And for some reason, that bothered him more than he expected.
Leon nodded slowly, his face still stiff. Then, a pause. ""Let's call off the wedding.""
Chapter 6
For a moment, Eloise's heart hollowed out. But then she smiled and nodded. ""Alright.""
He hadn't expected that. No crying, no pleading. Just acceptance. And somehow, that made his chest tighten with a new, dull frustration.
He pinched the bridge of his nose. ""Ellie told me it wasn't you. She's not doing well. I don't have the energy to deal with a wedding right now.""
Eloise stayed quiet. It all sounded so ridiculous, but she didn't say a word.
What was the point?
Eloise lay in bed, eyes blank, mind flooded with fragments of the past. She glanced at her phone.
Fifteen days until the wedding, to Mr. Bronner.
A sudden commotion came from the hallway. She pushed off the covers and walked to the door.
""I'm not marrying her."" Leon's voice was sharp over the phone.
""You can't do this to Eloise. She's been with you for years—what do you mean, you're not marrying her?!
""If I'm the reason you're doing this to her, then what's the point of me being alive? I'm just a burden!"" It was Aurelie's voice.
Eloise stood frozen, not sure what she was feeling. Then came Leon's voice again—gentle, helpless.
""Alright. I'll marry her. But please, take your meds, okay?""
The bitterness crept up her throat. Her chest tightened, and images from the past drifted in.
Back at Claire's manor, she wasn't even treated as well as the maids. Her mother used to turn the simplest ingredients into warm, comforting meals, but after she passed, Eloise barely ate. Anorexia followed. She grew thinner by the day.
When she got together with Leon, he started cooking for her, trying new recipes every day, refusing to let her eat alone. Whenever she lost her appetite, he'd stop everything to sit beside her and say, ""I'm here. You have to eat, alright?""
That same voice echoed now, but for someone else. Tears slid down her face, falling onto the floor, pooling silently.
Eloise let out a dry laugh and crawled back into bed.
Fifteen days and then she'd be gone. It's fine. Once she leaves, it won't hurt anymore.
She was woken by noise. She stepped out of the room and locked eyes with the woman across the hall. Aurelie looked back at her, guilt flashing in her soft gaze. She looked fragile, pitiful.
Leon immediately stepped in front of her, shielding her with his body. His voice carried a hint of irritation.
""Why are you looking at Ellie like that? She's not well. I brought her here to recover. Didn't you pass that nutritionist exam or whatever? Great—you can take care of her.""
For a second, Eloise's heart stopped. Then she looked up and smiled.
""Sure.""
She was leaving anyway. Consider it repayment for all those years Leon had treated her well. After that, she'd disappear.
The second her eyes landed on the table, her pupils shrank. Her mother's keepsake was gone!
She had brought it back from Claire's manor that day and left it right there on the table. How could it be gone?
""Maybe Leon moved it. That has to be it,"" she told herself, trying to stay calm.
She flung open every cabinet and tore through every drawer.
Nothing!
Nothing!
Still nothing!
Panic surged through her chest, her hands beginning to shake uncontrollably.
Leon came out of the bedroom, eyes drowsy, face dark with irritation. ""What are you doing? It's the middle of the night—Ellie can't handle noise, you know that.""
She didn't even register the sting of his words. She looked at him, desperate, like a wild thing that lost its mother—her face fragile, frantic.
""Where's my mom's photo?"" she asked, her voice trembling, barely above a whisper.
Leon frowned, eyes darting away.
She saw it—saw the flicker—and her body moved before she could think. She grabbed his arms tightly, nails digging in.
""Where is my mom's photo?!"" she screamed, raw and breaking.
Leon scowled, pulling away, his voice sharp and full of disdain.
""I threw it out, alright?!""
Chapter 7
""What... did you say?"" Those words hit Eloise like a bomb. She froze, unsure if she'd heard him right.
Leon avoided her gaze. ""It's not good to keep things from the dead around the house. Ellie needs peace and quiet to recover.""
This time, Eloise heard him clearly. Her hands slowly dropped to her sides. Her eyes flushed red, and tears began to fall silently, hitting the ground one by one.
She was going insane. How could Leon throw away the only photo her mother had left behind? He knew how much her mother meant to her.
""Where did you throw it?"" Her voice was hollow, drained of life, only disappointment left.
""I don't know. It was probably taken away with the rest of the trash."" As soon as the words left his mouth, Eloise turned and ran, but Leon grabbed her arm.
His face was filled with disapproval as he looked at her pale expression.
""Are you crazy? It's pouring outside!"" His grip was so tight it left a red mark on her skin.
But at that moment, it wasn't her arm that hurt—it was her chest. If she couldn't find that photo, she didn't even want to imagine what would happen.
Rain pounded down as Eloise threw herself into the storm. She found the nearest dumpster and shoved it over, sinking to her knees and clawing through the wet trash.
The stench was overwhelming, but she didn't notice. She moved on instinct, digging, searching, desperately hoping to see that photo.
Thunder cracked overhead, making her flinch and curl into herself. Rain streamed down her back, soaking her through, but she didn't feel the cold—only the raw, empty ache in her chest.
Nothing!
She staggered to the next dumpster. Her fingers were pale and shriveled from the water, and her eyes stung from the rain. She couldn't tell what was rain and what were tears anymore.
Then she saw it—just for a moment. A soft figure, smiling at her, reaching out a hand. ""My sweet Elle...""
Eloise dropped to her knees. She stared blankly at the woman in front of her, eyes glassy with hurt. The injustice in them was almost spilling over.
""Mom, I miss you so much!"" She rushed forward, wanting to hold that figure—but the next moment, it vanished.
She collapsed to the ground. It had been an illusion. Her trembling voice whispered into the puddle beneath her, nails scraping the concrete, drawing faint lines of blood.
""Please, Mom! Don't take the last thing you left me."" Her left hand brushed something solid, and she froze. Slowly, she pulled it out—it was the photo frame.
Water had seeped inside, ruining the already-faded picture. But she didn't care. It was still here. It wasn't gone. She clutched it tightly and broke down, crying hoarsely in the rain.
Inside his car, Leon sat motionless. The wipers screeched across the windshield. He stared at Eloise in the downpour, kneeling in the filth, clinging to a ruined photo.
His face was expressionless. But his hands were trembling on the steering wheel. He closed his eyes. And saw, again, the memories—those times Eloise had tried to end her life, again and again.
When he opened them, she was already collapsed in the rain.
He pushed open the car door and ran to her. And when he saw the soaked, half-destroyed frame still held in her arms, his pupils trembled. His throat tightened.
He bent down and scooped her up. Raindrops clung to her lashes. He reached to wipe them away—but jerked back from the heat of her skin.
""Elle, I'm taking you to the hospital.""
Chapter 8
Leon set her in the back seat and started the car.
Eloise was still conscious but burning up—hot one second, cold the next. Her teeth chattered uncontrollably.
She tried to open her eyes, just to see where she was, but she couldn't.
Then Leon's phone rang. She heard his urgent voice. ""What? Ellie has a fever? I'm heading back now.""
Something inside her went hollow. A single tear slipped down her cheek and landed on her arm—it burned.
Back at the apartment, Leon jumped out and ran off. No hesitation. No second glance.
Eloise sat there, clutching the photo of her mom. She waited and waited. The sky started to lighten, but Leon never came back down.
Her body kept burning. She was trembling now. With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone and called for an ambulance.
Every second after that dragged like a lifetime. Her limbs felt weighed down, her skin hot and crawling, like bugs were eating her alive.
Finally, the ambulance arrived. The moment she heard the siren, she let go and closed her eyes.
When she opened them again, the sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose.
She struggled to sit up—and then, out of nowhere, pain exploded across her cheek.
She stared in disbelief. Leon was standing there, face dark, eyes full of disgust.
His look stabbed through Eloise like a knife while she gripped the sheets tightly. ""What the hell is your problem?""
He looked at her like she was filth. His tone cut deep as he continued, ""Real clever. Opening Ellie's window just to get her sick.""
Eloise froze, then shot back, ""I didn't.""
Leon's expression darkened even more. ""You switched her meds, too. She had a seizure last night—almost died!""
Eloise had no idea why Leon believed it was her. Her throat felt dry, but she still said, ""I didn't do it.""
Seeing her refuse to admit it only fueled Leon's rage. He let out a cold laugh.
""Oh? Still denying it, huh?"" His eyes landed on the photo frame sitting on the table. He smirked and picked it up.
Eloise saw what he was doing, and alarm bells went off in her head. ""What are you doing?!""
""Just showing you what happens when you mess with Ellie."" The moment the words left his mouth, he dropped the frame.
Smash!
The glass shattered into pieces. Eloise's heart clenched hard. ""No!""
She reached for it, but Leon was faster. He grabbed the photo inside with his big hand.
Then he looked at her, smiled, and began tearing it. In half. Then in quarters. And then into scraps too small to recognize.
In that moment, Eloise swore she heard her heart break.
""No!"" The cry tore from her throat, raw and full of anguish.
She watched as Leon flung the pieces out the window. A gust of wind scattered them into nothing.
Eloise stared blankly. Her shoulders sank. Her whole body seemed to collapse in on itself. She dropped onto the bed, lifeless.
Her fingers curled tightly, digging hard into her palms, as if the physical pain could numb the emotional pain inside.
Then she turned her head and saw Aurelie standing in the doorway, wearing a smug, triumphant smile.
A chill ran straight through Eloise; even her fingertips felt cold.
What was there left to doubt?
The sweet, gentle act—that was all it was. An act. But Eloise still couldn't figure out what she'd done to deserve this kind of revenge.
It had all been a setup. Her own personal hell had been scripted and directed.
She stared coldly as Leon pulled Aurelie into his arms, eyes full of worry. A
urelie, red-eyed, looked at her and said gently, ""It must be a mistake. Elle would never hurt me, Leon.""
Chapter 9
Leon frowned and gently patted Aurellie's head. ""Ellie, you're still too kind.""
Then he scooped her up in his arms. ""Silly girl, you can't just run around. I'm taking you for a checkup.""
After they left, Eloise sat on the bed with a bitter smile.
She pulled out her phone and checked the time.
Five days left.
Back at her apartment, she packed everything she owned into a suitcase. Years of living here, yet she couldn't even fill one bag.
Pathetic. She sat on the floor, stunned as the door suddenly swung open.
Leon stormed in, eyes frantic. ""Ellie needs surgery. You're a match. I need your heart—now.""
Eloise froze. She couldn't believe what she'd just heard. He wanted her dead.
She shook her head. ""No.""
His face darkened. Lips pressed tight, fury in his eyes.
Before he could speak again, the hospital called. ""Mr. Brunner, I'm sorry. Ms. Berna didn't make it.""
The phone slipped from his hand. His arms dropped to his sides. His face turned cold and lifeless.
Then he looked at her, like he'd snapped. ""It's all your fault. If you hadn't switched her meds, if you'd just given her your heart, she'd still be alive!""
Eloise backed away from his crazed stare, but he lunged and grabbed her.
He locked her up.
Leon grabbed the pliers and ripped out all ten of her nails.
The pain was blinding, like red-hot wire stabbing straight into her fingers, tearing flesh like serrated steel.
Eloise broke out in a cold sweat. Her ears rang sharply and loudly. Darkness crept into her vision. She could smell blood—rusty, metallic, sickening. Her stomach churned.
Pale and shaking, she looked at him. ""I told you it wasn't me."" Yet, he said nothing, just stood there, watching her in silence.
She passed out more than once, slipping in and out of the pain, and when she finally came to again, he was gone. The window was open. Something in her snapped.
She had to get out.
She crawled toward it, stumbling and gasping, dragging herself up with raw, bleeding hands. The second her fingers touched the frame, a fresh wave of agony shot through her, but she didn't stop. Her back was drenched in sweat by the time she pulled herself up and through.
Today was it. Her last chance.
It was the third-floor—high, but not fatal. She looked down, the ground spinning beneath her. All she could hear was her own ragged breath, the pounding of her heart, and then, without a second thought, she jumped.
The moment she hit the ground, something cracked. Her thigh screamed like it'd been split open, her left arm went numb, and her throat filled with the sharp taste of blood, but she didn't pause.
She couldn't. Leon was insane. If she stopped now, she was dead.
She pushed through the pain and ran, bolting toward the road, limbs barely working, lungs burning.
A car skidded to a halt in front of her, the window rolling down slowly.
""Get in.""
Chapter 10
Eloise got into the car. She looked at Yvonne sitting in the driver's seat and couldn't help but ask, ""How did you get here?""
Yvonne blew a smoke ring, her expression complicated. ""Tomorrow is the deadline. If I don't come to find you, am I supposed to get married?""
This sentence shut down all of Eloise's words, and she fell silent. ""I understand.""
Yvonne took her to the hospital, and after her wound was bandaged, they sat in silence facing each other.
Yvonne looked at her sister, feeling a mix of emotions she couldn't quite describe. She couldn't say she loved Eloise, but she also couldn't say she hated her.
Eloise's appearance indeed made her and her mother a laughingstock, and over the years she did many things to hurt Eloise.
When she saw Eloise being bullied by others so badly, she was actually a little annoyed. Eloise could only be bullied by her.
Seeing Eloise's pale face, Yvonne stood up with a frown and handed her a USB drive.
Eloise looked at the USB drive in her palm and stared at Yvonne in confusion, ""What is this?""
Her fingers still ached painfully, and Eloise's face was pale at the moment.
Yvonne looked at her like this, curled her lips. ""Fool, do you really think Aurelie treats you as a sister? You are really stupid; her heart disease has long been cured! These dirty things she did, consider it as my compensation to you over the years, I don't owe you anymore in the future.""
Impatiently, but Eloise could tell that she cared about her. The USB flash drive in her hand suddenly felt like it weighed a thousand pounds, heavy. She plugged the USB flash drive into the computer and, upon seeing what was inside, her face instantly turned pale.
Eloise's lips trembled, ""She, she could actually do such a thing.""
Yvonne looked disdainful, ""These people only care about their own survival, they don't care who dies.""
Aurelie did have a heart condition, but she has been cured.
The Berna family sponsored many welfare homes in the city, and went to great lengths to find a girl who matched Aurelie's blood type. Then, they dug out that girl's heart. A vibrant life was lost just like that.
It seems that Aurelie also faked her death this time.
Eloise clenched the USB drive in her hand and sent the evidence to the lawyer. Those who do wrong must receive punishment.
Eloise looked up at Yvonne and said softly, ""Yvonne, thank you.""
Yvonne turned her head awkwardly, ""Don't be so presumptuous, I just don't want to owe you anything.""
With that, she pulled out something from behind her.
Eloise took a closer look and realized it was a photo of her and her mother!
Joy surged through her in an instant, a smile playing on her lips and in her eyes as she looked at Yvonne in surprise.
Yvonne saw her so happy, the frown between her eyebrows gradually disappeared. ""At first, I had thoughts of bullying you, but I also knew that this was the only photo left by your mother for you. I kept a backup, and what I smashed back then was the backup. This is the original.""
A wave of emotion swept through her heart as Eloise tremblingly took the photo with both hands, holding it tightly to her chest, tears glistening in her eyes.
She thought she would never see the keepsake left by her mother again in her lifetime, but she didn't expect to regain it so soon.
""Thank you, Yvonne.""
Yvonne turned her head slightly and said, ""I transferred one million to your account. Dad refused to give you a dowry. But you went on my behalf, so I will give it to you.""
After saying that, Yvonne strode away, her back carrying a hint of fleeing. Eloise watched her departing figure, unable to snap out of her daze for a long time.
Fortunately, she was able to leave Leon.
When night fell, a middle-aged man in black knocked on Eloise's ward with a respectful attitude.
""Ms. Claire, Mr. Bronner sent me to pick you up.""
Eloise nodded and, as she got on the car, she looked out the window at the scenery that was constantly receding, feeling a bit dazed.
Finally, it was time to leave.
On their way to the Bronner estate, the driver adjusted the rearview mirror. His voice was low, almost reverent.
""Mr. Bronner has been waiting for you for years, Ms. Claire.""

It’s been about a month and a half since we broke up. He ended things, twice (other time was about 6 months ago). The second time, he told me not to contact him again. I haven’t. But I miss him so much it physically hurts some days.

The strangest part is… my life is actually getting better. I’m starting grad school this fall. I adopted a cat. I’ve been biking again, even got a new bike which I know he would be so excited about. I feel more stable and grounded. I’m doing things I probably wouldn’t have done if we’d stayed together. And yet, I keep thinking: what if we could have made it work now?

We were planning to move together across the country. He got an opportunity, and I was going to go with him. But I hesitated. I was afraid of giving up my life, my friends, my hobbies, and possibly motherhood. It felt like too much to sacrifice for someone whose life looked so different from mine. But now, it all feels wrong. Now that my own life is becoming more certain, I feel like we could’ve woven our lives together, but previously I didn’t know how to do it without losing myself.

He said I could be his person. And I believed him. But we ended because of uncertainty, and the fact that he didn’t want kids an I did. I told him I was working on figuring out if kids were something I could give up, and he ended it before we even tried.

I went on a date recently with someone new. He didn’t even offer to pay for my coffee. And that one small thing made me realize how incredibly thoughtful and giving my ex was. He would’ve never let me pay. He’d fix my bike, make me breakfast, buy snacks I liked, take on chores just to make my life easier. He’d listen. He’d show up. He wanted to build a whole life with me. He wanted me to come with him. And now, I just feel so heartbroken that something that deep still wasn’t enough.

I keep wondering if I made a mistake. I’m realizing I might not even want kids after all. That maybe we were more compatible than I knew at the time. But I didn’t have that clarity when it mattered. And now he’s gone.

I keep hoping he’ll reach out. But he told me not to contact him. I’m terrified of reaching out just to be ignored or rejected again.

I just miss him. I miss feeling safe. What do I do?",4,1752779043.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Hermione loved books. She loved big books, small books, thin books, thick books. Old books, new books and books that were just old enough to have the pages turning mellow and soft from being read so much. The only thign she missed from Hogwarts was unrestricted and unfettered access to the library.

She wanted to find someone who would share this love of books with her for the rest of their lives together. Who would respect the power of books to change the world and the history, the souls that remained in the books so long after their authors had written them. In the magical world sometimes quite literally.

She had a book with her at all times. Books that held small ideas, big ideas and ideas that fit in your pocket. During the war the book in her hip pocket had saved her life when it absorbed a spell meant to tear her leg off. The fact it tore the cover of the book off had served to inspire her to great lengths of retribution against the caster.

So she knew any mate, any life-partner, any one worthy would love books just as much as she did. Or at least could be encouraged and learn to love the books as much as her. For printed ink ran through her blood and the smell of books sustained her.

She had looked at Ron Weasley and while he enjoyed a certain type of book his appreciation was limited far too much. Busty Asian babes and the Chronicles of Quidditch Annual were considered deep reading materials in his mind. Hermione shook her head no and moved onwards.

Maybe Neville would be a good choice. He liked books about plants, about people who grew plants, about plant people. He would talk all day about plants and into the night. While his length and breadth of plant based knowledge was impressive she wanted to explore the entire world of printed books.

Her friend Luna read a lot of books and even wrote articles for the magazine her father ran. Some of the articles and books she read were a bit out there and wild but she at least also understood the classics and could hold a conversation on most subjects. The only problem with Luna was she already loved Neville far too much to ever consider another. Hermione hoped Neville figured it out for himself son enough or he might wind up with a Luna surprise. So Hermione continued her search.

Ginny and Harry had discovered they did not love each other so much as the idea of each other and broken apart. Not to mention they had discovered they shared an attraction to the same types of girls. Maybe one or the other of them?

Hermione sighed as Ginny was far too much like a little sister to her. A younger version of Ron with boobs who thought books were neat and useful but thanks to a bad experience with the diary in her first year did not entirely trust them still. No Ginny would be a good friend but not a soul mate.

Harry had appreciated Hermione's skill with books and was willing to read, when Ron or Ginny wasn't dragging him off to a Quidditch game or some other distraction. Harry was nice, kept himself clean and fit, and had a sense of decency and kindness about him that made people like him. She smiled as she thought, yes Harry would do quite nicely.

“Harry? I was wondering if you'd like to go to a book signing with me Saturday? Then there is a used book sale that is going on at the library.”

Harry looked at her then with a soft smile and a shrug, “Yeah sure. Sounds like a nice time. Who is the author?”

“Daisy Decibel. Its her autobiography.” She replied happily.

“Oh okay. I don't know her, wanna talk about her over some coffee?”

“ I would love that Harry.” Hermione said wondering how merging their libraries would feel....",4,1752778976.0,HPharmony,0,1.0,False
1m2g5ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/SemaglutideGuide/comments/1m2g5ms/more_than_just_pounds_the_surprising_nonweight/,More Than Just Pounds: The Surprising Non-Weight Shifts I Felt on Semaglutide,"Track Your GLP-1 Journey With The [GLP-1 LOG IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glp-1-log-injections-tracker/id6747810242?platform=iphone)


When we talk about Semaglutide, the conversation almost always kicks off with weight loss. And, let's be honest, that's often the main reason many of us consider it in the first place. You see the before-and-after photos, you hear the success stories, and you start to wonder if it could be your turn. But here's the thing- what if I told you that for me, some of the most profound changes on Semaglutide had little to do with the number on the scale?

It's true! While the weight loss has been a significant part of my journey, I've found that Semaglutide has quietly, almost subtly, reshaped other areas of my life. These aren't always the headline-grabbing changes, but they're incredibly impactful nonetheless. You might be wondering what I'm talking about. Well, let me pull back the curtain and share some of the unexpected shifts I've experienced.

**The Silent Revolution: Calming the Food Obsession**

This is, by far, one of the biggest non-weight-related shifts I've felt. Before Semaglutide, my brain felt like it was constantly buzzing with ""food noise."" Thoughts about what I'd eat next, what I shouldn't eat, what I ate yesterday- it was exhausting.

* **Less Mental Clutter**: Imagine a quiet room after years of constant background chatter. That's what it felt like. The endless loop of food thoughts just... faded.
* **Freedom from Cravings**: Those intense, almost magnetic pulls towards certain foods? They significantly lessened. It wasn't that I never wanted a cookie, but the *urgency* was gone.
* **Reduced Guilt and Shame**: We've all been there, right? Eating something and immediately feeling that wave of regret. With less impulsive eating, that emotional burden lifted. It's actually pretty liberating.

This quietening isn't just about eating less; it's about reclaiming mental space. It's like my brain got an upgrade, freeing up processing power for other things.

**Beyond the Plate: Shifting Energy and Focus**

You might think that eating less would make you feel low on energy, especially in the beginning. And yes, there can be an adjustment period. But once my body settled into the routine, I noticed some really positive changes in my overall energy and mental sharpness.

* **Stable Energy Levels**: Remember those energy crashes after a big, carb-heavy meal? Or the afternoon slump that made you reach for another coffee? Those became far less common.
 * My blood sugar felt more stable throughout the day.
 * I didn't experience the dramatic highs and lows I used to.
* **Improved Mental Clarity**: With less ""food noise"" and more stable energy, my focus improved dramatically.
 * I could concentrate for longer periods.
 * Tasks that used to feel overwhelming became more manageable.
 * It felt like my brain was running on cleaner fuel.

This wasn't an immediate jolt of energy, but a consistent, underlying hum that allowed me to be more productive and present.

**Holistic Harmony: Ripple Effects on Sleep and Mood**

It's fascinating how one change can create a domino effect across your entire well-being. Once my relationship with food shifted and my energy stabilized, I started noticing improvements in areas I hadn't even considered.

* **Better Sleep Quality**: This was a pleasant surprise. I found myself falling asleep more easily and staying asleep through the night.
 * Less nighttime hunger pangs waking me up.
 * A general sense of calm that made winding down easier.
 * Waking up feeling more refreshed than before.
* **Enhanced Mood and Emotional Regulation**: I'm not saying Semaglutide is an antidepressant, but for me, the overall reduction in stress surrounding food, combined with better sleep, had a positive impact on my mood.
 * Fewer emotional eating triggers.
 * A greater sense of control and self-efficacy.
 * Less anxiety related to food choices or body image.

It's like Semaglutide helped lay a foundation for overall well-being, allowing these other positive shifts to emerge naturally.

**What This Means for You**

My journey on Semaglutide has truly been more than just a weight loss story. It's been about rediscovering a sense of balance, both physically and mentally. If you're considering Semaglutide, or even if you're already on it, I encourage you to pay attention to these subtle, yet powerful, shifts. They might just be the most valuable benefits you experience.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique. But opening yourself up to these ""beyond the scale"" changes can truly transform your experience into something much richer than you ever anticipated. It's about feeling better, living more freely, and discovering a new kind of peace.",1,1752778874.0,SemaglutideGuide,0,1.0,False

Make sure you are emailing them NOW LOL.*

I need to get these nerves & jitters out by telling this warning story to y'all. This could have ended BADLY.

I need to preface by saying that I work for this couple, their wedding is next month (August), and I am sharing this experience with everybody so that nobody goes through this mayhem. I will add that I am a sailor with my language - I am not sorry. I AM NOT A WEDDING COORDINATOR. Just a simple photographer.

Edit to add: This catering company works exclusively with this venue.

This morning, as I was sipping away on my coffee, trying to figure out what to do with my only day off, I received a phone call from a catering company. The time was **9:40 AM**. Respectfully, I ignored the fvck out of it. That was until I received a voice message expressing the following, *""Hi, this is X from X catering.... we have been unsuccessful in reaching the couple for weeks. They are overdue for their final payment and have not reached out to the venue. At this point, as of noon time today, the wedding is going into cancellation mode...""* Ended with stating that if any vendor knows information that they were unaware of, to immediately let them know.

PANIC MODE! I choked down the last sip of my coffee and went straight to the desktop. I pulled their wedding information and whilst I may have not heard any communication since October of 2024, I did not think anything unusual. Many clients do not have all final details until usually around the one month out mark.

I paced and paced between the kitchen to my office and back. My children watched me with curiosity as I got the sudden idea to call the venue directly. So, I did and a very similar message was being conveyed to me... Their boss had not been hearing back from the couple and they will let me know if there were any updates.

*Sh\*t, what's going on?*

**9:51 AM** I sent a friendly text directly to the couple to inquire about what was going on and why it felt like this sudden goose chase.

**11:14 AM** I received an update text message from a number I did not recognize...it made me pause...*""Hi! It's X from X venue. I just wanted to let you know that the wedding has been canceled. We still haven't heard back from anyone and the caterer has decided to cancel. I'm so sorry!!""*

My heart sank but I was confused. With my personal experience with the couple...How could a couple go from booking me, having a beautiful session with me, updating their wedding website, to now suddenly nobody knows where they are? I truly thought the worst has happened. *Until...*

Text back from the CLIENT at **12:10 PM**, *""Hello, sorry to have caught you in this mid communication. We had a lot going on before sending over our final guest count. The wedding is moving forward.""* Ending with an apology.

I responded back expressing my excitement that this was moving forward but explained that the catering company contacted me stating they canceled the wedding.

20 minutes later...*""Yes, it's all set now. Sorry for the confusion we were just a day late sending our final seating chart.""*

WELL SH\*T GUYS! FORBID you are a single day late. Forbid we all have busy lives and may need just that extra day. Has anyone experienced this? This couple are very sweet people & this catering company put unnecessary fear & panic to ALL VENDORS. I do not think people are perfect but sh\*t this ain't the way to communicate with people or try to find out information at all. It was of none of my concern that they did not pay them. A simple, ""have you heard from them"" would have been enough. It was not needed to start a wild goose chase for a simple day late sending of a fvcking seating chart.

Wish me luck on this wedding. I hope the catering + venue company does not cause any issues on the actual day of.",0,1752778811.0,wedding,44,0.28,False
1m2g49b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1m2g49b/bpal_tomie_review/,BPAL Tomie review,"I ordered 6 sample Imps (Peacock Queen, Whip, Blood Rose, Rose Cross, Persephone, London), this bottle, and got 5 frimps (Amsterdam, Brimstone, Prague, Sjofn, Bugbear Doula). Tomie is my definitely favorite. I'll be writing reviews for the others as I get to fully testing them!  
\-------

For context: I am brand-new to the world of scents! I previously never wore fragrance. I'm extremely sensitive to smells, and fell into a rabbit hole while searching for a perfume that matched my favorite rose + leather candle. That rabbithole let to me placing large sample orders to BPAL and Fantome after joining this sub. 

Me: 30-something trans man working an office job. 

Notes I like: Rose, wood, smoke, leather, orange, realistic coffee. 

Notes I'm OK with if they're not too strong: Berry, aquatics, incense, vanilla, amber.

Notes I dislike: Gourmands, sweet cream, artificial fruit (especially lemon, banana, and watermelon). 

\-----

TOMIE: 

I was aware that Junji Ito is a famous horror manga artist, and that Tomie is a female character, but beyond that, I was not at all familiar with Tomie prior to reading the notes of this perfume. I don't remember how I came upon the listing for Tomie on BPAL, but one reviewer sold me on it when they said this was their favorite out of their 30+ BPAL bottles. 

While waiting for Tomie to arrive, I read up on her. Perhaps I shouldn't have, so I would've had a clean-slate first impression, but here we are!

In the bottle: dark, mysterious, feminine-of-center, but could also be the scent of a soft and bewitching man or genderless being. Something a little floral, a little woody, that makes me feel lulled into being pulled into its embrace. There's the hint of something sweet upon the beginning of the first whiff, but that hint doesn't play out. It's a promise of sweetness that's not followed through on. Upon exhaling and inhaling again, the breath feels chilled, and somehow hungry. This is the scent of a beautiful girl who you spot in a crowd in the mall, who smiles mysteriously before disappearing. You get the sense that she's much more worldly, experienced, and complexed than her youth suggests. There's something dark there. But in the darkness, there's also youthful feminine beauty.

On my skin: The sweetness pushes through a bit more - there's something skirting along medicinal, if the smell of medicine could be beautiful and somewhat seductive. The sweetness of pale blonde sandalwood seems to be almost holding back the scent of nighttime jasmine. There's an ever-so-slight bitterness upon exhale and inhale, in the back of my throat. The sweetness is really unique and hard to describe. While most sweet notes are girlish and youthful, this one is not. This one is alluring, and slighty inhuman. I want to lean in and sniff again to see if I was mistaken (I was not - there's a very slight sour note to the sweetness that's almost imperceptible). It's kind of like the sweetness of dark berries, but made more complicated here with the addition of wood, vanilla, and amber. 

Dry: The wood is stronger now. So is the slightly-sour-slightly-medicine-something's wrong but I love it SOMETHING that was in the background earlier. If I were told this were the smell of the most beautiful medicine in the world, I would believe it. At this point, I feel like I've followed the initial scent past the jasmine and vanilla into the woods and amber. The sun has set and the stars have come out, and I am lost. But I am at peace. There's a growing feeling of loneliness and surrender. It's beautiful and soothing. This is a smell that I could curl up in and fall asleep to in the darkness. It's the taste of a fairytale's sleeping draught. It's changed from the wet scent's suggestion of youthful feminine beauty to something still beautiful, but older, farther from human and closer to nature. You've followed the scent miles and miles away from the mall and are now in a dark forest under starlight. You don't remember how you got here and you're okay with that. The woods are closing in and lulling you to sleep forever. 

It's quite amazing how this scent begins as recognizable notes and imagery, ultimately transforming into something else. On me, this dries down to being lost in Grimm's Fairytales forest at night, under the stars -- beautiful, lone, and there's no guarantee of safety. 

I would feel comfortable wearing this anywhere, anytime, year-round. I could very much see this being my signature scent in the winter especially, or whenever I'm in the mood to embody a beguiling, underestimated, beautiful creature beyond human comprehension.",5,1752778791.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

1m2g3l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m2g3l0/the_night_visitor/,The night visitor.,"The gas station was just off Highway 42, nestled between a dying lumber town and a stretch of forest that always looked darker than it should. We were twenty miles from the nearest real city, and even then, “real” was a generous word. The building was nothing special—yellow flickering sign, two pumps, a dingy bathroom around the back. But to me, it was sacred. Quiet. Simple. A paycheck. I worked the graveyard shift, 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., six days a week. It wasn’t glamorous, but it paid the rent, and there weren’t many other options out here.

Most nights were dead. A drunk or two. Maybe a logging trucker needing smokes and coffee. The occasional hitchhiker who looked like they’d crawled out of hell. I kept my head down. Eyes on the register. One earbud in, playing old Nirvana tracks low enough to hear the bell on the door.

Then he started showing up.

I remember the first night like a scratch on a clean record. It was just past 2 a.m. when he pulled up. No car—just appeared at the edge of the lot, walking from the treeline like he’d stepped out of the forest itself. He was tall. Unnaturally so. Thin, but not sickly. Just… off. Too tall for his proportions. Shoulders slouched forward like a bird trying to fold its wings in. His jacket—olive green and moth-bitten—hung down to his knees. His hands were buried deep in the pockets. Head down. Face hidden under a low, trucker-style cap.

He didn’t come in that night. Just stood outside. At the farthest pump, maybe fifty feet from the windows. Staring. Or at least, I thought he was staring. Couldn’t see his face clearly. He didn’t move for over ten minutes. I considered calling someone, but out here, ""someone"" meant the one part-time sheriff deputy who worked nights and slept through most calls. Eventually, the man turned and walked back into the woods. Vanished like mist.

Second night, same thing. This time, closer. Thirty feet maybe. Again, he didn’t move. Didn’t speak. Just stood there while I pretended not to notice him. My stomach did that weird cold coil thing, like when you’re about to get in trouble or see a car crash. After twenty minutes, he left again.

By the fifth night, he was standing right outside the glass.

I didn’t hear him approach. Didn’t see him cross the lot. Just turned from the register to find him on the other side of the windowpane, barely inches away. I stumbled back so hard I knocked over the display of Slim Jims.

His face.

God.

It wasn’t anything overtly monstrous. That would’ve been easier. It was just… wrong. Pale skin, like someone who hadn’t seen daylight in years. Lips too wide, stretched slightly upward in what might have been a smile, but with no warmth. Eyes so deeply sunken they looked like ink blots, no reflection, no emotion. And his teeth—when he parted his lips just enough—I saw rows of them. Tiny. Too many. Some were black. Some chipped. All too small, like baby teeth filed down.

I screamed. Out loud. I hadn’t meant to.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t flinch.

Just stood there. Watching.

That night I called the sheriff.

He didn’t pick up.

Left a voicemail.

Nothing came of it.

Next night, I brought a tire iron from my trunk and set it behind the counter. Left the lights brighter. Kept all doors locked, even though policy said I had to leave the bathroom key available.

He came back. This time, he smiled. Actually smiled. Wide. All teeth. Pressed his face right up to the glass. I could hear the faintest sound of his breath fogging the pane.

That night, I didn’t call anyone. Didn’t run. Just stood still, holding the tire iron like a crucifix, hoping he wouldn’t come inside. Eventually, he left again. But slower this time. Almost reluctant.

I didn’t sleep that day. Laid in bed watching the corners of my room, waiting to see that same silhouette in the window. I didn’t eat. I didn’t shower. Just came back the next night like a moth to the flame.

He didn’t come that time.

Or the time after that.

A week went by.

I convinced myself it was over. Maybe just a drifter playing games. Maybe a hallucination from too much caffeine and not enough sleep.

Then, Friday night, 3 a.m., the power went out.

All at once. No warning.

The light above the register popped.

My playlist died in my earbuds.

And the lot outside turned black.

I sat in that thick silence for only a moment before the emergency light kicked in—one sickly red bulb behind the counter, barely enough to see.

And then I heard it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

From the back window.

Tap. Tap. Taptaptap.

Faster now.

I grabbed the tire iron. Heart slamming against my ribs.

I wanted to run, but my feet wouldn’t work.

The sound stopped.

I waited.

Nothing.

Then a new sound, directly behind me—closer.

The bell.

The door chime.

But I hadn’t unlocked it.

I turned, trembling.

The door was shut.

No one inside.

But there—across the floor—were wet footprints.

Bare feet. Long. Thin. Leading from the door halfway to the counter. Then… they stopped.

As if he’d vanished mid-step.

I didn’t move from the counter for the rest of the shift. When morning came, and the power snapped back on like nothing had happened, I ran out without clocking out. I drove home and called my manager and quit. He didn’t sound surprised. Didn’t even ask for two weeks’ notice. Just said, “Yeah. I get it.”

That afternoon, I drove out to the edge of the woods where the man always came from. I don’t know why. Maybe to see if I could find any clue. Maybe to prove to myself that it was all in my head.

I walked fifteen feet in.

Twenty.

The trees were too close together. The air smelled rotten. Like wet meat.

I turned around.

He was behind me.

Closer than ever.

Three feet away.

Face-to-face.

No smile this time.

Just empty eyes.

I dropped the flashlight. Bolted.

I didn’t hear him chase me.

Didn’t feel him follow.

But I felt something. That cold coil again, only this time, it wrapped tight around my spine and stayed there long after I reached my car and locked the doors.

I never went back to the station.

Tried to move in with my sister three towns over. Told her I had a breakdown. Told her I needed help. She gave me the guest room and said we’d figure it out.

I lasted two nights.

Because he came again.

Not at the station.

But here.

To the house.

Standing at the end of the driveway at 3:12 a.m., staring up at the window of the guest room.

I didn’t sleep that night. I waited until dawn, then packed my bags and left without a word. Didn’t explain. Didn’t say goodbye.

He wasn’t just a gas station drifter.

He followed me.

Everywhere I’ve gone since, he’s followed. Never during the day. Always at night. Sometimes it’s the sound of the bell chime when I’m alone in a room. Sometimes it’s tapping on the bathroom mirror when I’m brushing my teeth. Sometimes I find muddy footprints on my porch. Once, I found one inside my locked apartment.

I don’t work anymore.

Can’t.

Don’t leave the house unless it’s daylight.

Don’t answer the phone after dark.

And still—he comes.

He’s patient.

Each night, closer.

I’ve tried everything—lights, cameras, alarms.

They don’t stop him.

They just record it.

I have hours of footage now. Him standing silently at my window. Him crawling across the ceiling of the hallway while I sleep on the couch. Him standing in the corner of the room, inches away, unmoving, while I toss and turn in nightmares I don’t remember.

Police don’t believe me.

One officer watched the footage and quit the force three days later.

I called a priest once. He blessed the house.

The next night, the priest was found wandering the woods barefoot, mumbling nonsense. He didn’t remember why he went there.

I don’t know what he wants.

I don’t know who—or what—he is.

Only this:

He never speaks.

Never leaves marks.

Just watches.

Like he’s waiting for something.

And I think tonight might be the night he finally stops waiting.

I’ve seen signs.

All the lights flickered earlier.

My clocks are frozen at 3:12.

The power is already out.

And the bell just rang.

But the door is still locked.

And I haven’t moved.

He’s inside.

I can feel him.

Right behind me.

Watching.

1m2g2wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/13Psalm/comments/1m2g2wk/psalm_13_jeff_arc_continued/,Psalm 13 Jeff Arc continued,"Rain tickles the windows. Outside, wind moans through the trees. A cul-de-sac sleeps under thick clouds.

 

Inside, it’s warm. Domestic. Clean.

 

A babysitter — Elena, 17 — sits on the couch, texting on her phone. The soft hum of a baby monitor buzzes from the table beside her. Upstairs, a child sleeps.

 

The TV plays something light, sitcom laughter filling the silence.

 

She munches on popcorn, glancing at the digital clock: 11:56 PM.

 

Elena (texting):

“Parents said they’d be home by 12. Easiest $40 of my life.”

 

She stretches, scrolling absentmindedly.

 

The monitor crackles.

 

Elena frowns.

 

She looks down at it.

 

The sound is faint… breathing.

 

Then, slowly, the creak of a floorboard.

 

Elena (whispering):

“Nope…”

 

She gets up. Quietly.

 

She tiptoes toward the stairs, listening closely. The monitor hisses again — a static pop.

 

Then…

 

Laughter.

 

Dry. Hollow. Childlike and wrong.

 

Elena:

“…no, no, no…”

 

She grabs a kitchen knife. Her hands tremble.

 

As she reaches the staircase, her phone buzzes.

 

A text from the parents:

 

“Hey, sorry, running late. Be there by 12:30!”

 

 

 

She stares at the message, then toward the baby monitor again. The laughter is gone.

 

Now, a low voice.

 

Right into the mic.

 

“Go to sleep.”

 

Elena screams, dropping the monitor. She bolts up the stairs, barefoot, knife in hand.

 

The hallway is dark.

 

The child’s room is cracked open. Light from a nightlight spills out.

 

She pushes the door wide.

 

Nothing.

 

The crib is empty.

 

Her breathing quickens.

 

Behind her — the floor creaks.

 

She spins.

 

Jeff is there.

 

Tall. Pale. Eyes wide. Face torn by that grotesque, permanent grin.

 

His hoodie is soaked through. His blade shines under the hallway light.

 

He doesn’t move. He just stares.

 

The knife in Elena’s hand trembles.

 

Jeff:

“You blinked.”

 

Elena:

“Please—!”

 

She lunges, knife forward, but it’s like charging a shadow. Jeff slips past, graceful, inhuman. One motion — a slash — and her arm opens wide.

 

She falls backward, clutching it, blood smearing the walls.

 

Jeff walks toward her slowly, dragging his knife against the wall, letting it sing.

 

From the shadows… the cry of the child, muffled.

 

Jeff (low):

“Didn’t even check the closet.”

 

Elena scrambles, using her body to block the nursery door. He doesn’t rush.

 

He kneels in front of her.

 

Jeff (soft, cruel):

“You’re not worth remembering.”

 

CUT TO BLACK.

 

SFX: One final scream. Then silence.

 

 

 

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET – NIGHT

 

Police lights strobe in the rain.

 

A mother collapses to her knees. Officers hold her back. A father vomits into the grass.

 

Paramedics wheel out a bloodied baby, still alive, crying.

 

They never found Elena’s face. Only her hands.

 scratched into the crib’s wood:

 

“GO TO SLEEP

 

 

 

The neighborhood was unremarkable—two-story homes, trimmed hedges, wind chimes that clinked softly in the breeze. Streetlights bled amber onto the sidewalks. Porch lights flicked off one by one as families settled in for the night. It was the kind of place where nothing bad ever happened.

 

Until tonight.

 

Inside the Phillips residence—no relation to Lou—a seventeen-year-old named Ashley was curled up on the couch, flipping through channels. She’d already tucked the kids into bed—Emma and Ryan, six and four. Good kids. Easy money.

 

The parents were at a company gala. They’d be back around midnight.

 

A floorboard creaked upstairs.

 

Ashley’s eyes darted up. She waited.

 

Silence.

 

“…Emma?” she called out.

 

Nothing.

 

She shook her head. Probably the house settling.

 

But across the street, something moved. A dark shape stepped between hedges, just beyond the glow of the porch lights. A silhouette—tall, thin, crooked posture like a scarecrow hung wrong.

 

Ashley didn’t see it.

 

But the neighbors’ dog did. It barked furiously, yanking at its chain, then whimpered and backed into its doghouse.

 

Upstairs, something brushed against a mobile in the kids’ room. It spun slowly, its soft jingle barely audible.

 

Ashley stood, unease building in her stomach. She turned on the hallway light and moved toward the stairs.

 

That’s when the TV changed channels.

 

Not with the remote. Not with any button.

 

It just flicked—to static. A low hum filled the room.

 

Ashley stared at it, confused.

 

The remote was still on the coffee table.

 

She turned around—and stopped.

 

There was a man in the hallway.

 

Pale.

 

Too pale.

 

Drenched in shadow except for his face—white skin, black hair, and a carved, eternal grin.

 

He didn’t speak. He didn’t blink.

 

Ashley screamed.

 

She bolted for the kitchen, grabbing a butcher knife. Her hands trembled. She locked the door and called 911, whispering into the phone, begging for them to come.

 

The line went dead.

 

No dial tone.

 

No service.

 

The backdoor creaked open.

 

She turned and saw it swaying, just slightly.

 

Something scraped across the tiles. Not footsteps—fingernails.

 

She backed up, knife raised, tears rolling down her cheeks.

 

The power cut out.

 

Darkness swallowed the house.

 

Upstairs, Emma screamed.

 

Then Ryan.

 

Ashley rushed up the stairs, blade clenched tight.

 

She flung open the kids’ room—and found the beds empty.

 

But on the wall, written in something thick and red, was one sentence:

 

“GO TO SLEEP.”

 

The closet door opened behind her.

 

And Jeff was there.

 

He didn’t charge.

 

He slithered forward, almost gliding, his wide eyes never blinking, that wicked smile growing, splitting, as if it was dragging his whole face down.

 

Ashley slashed at him. He took it—right across the chest. Didn’t flinch. Just giggled. High-pitched. Wrong.

 

He knocked the knife away and tackled her.

 

Screams echoed down the street.

 

Neighbors later said it sounded like a cat being slowly strangled.

 

When the police arrived hours later, they found the house in flames. The parents were hysterical. The bodies—

 

—Ashley, Emma, Ryan—were found in the basement. Arranged like dolls.

 

Ashley’s eyes had been carved out. Emma and Ryan’s faces had been painted with their own blood, shaped into forced smiles.

 

The words “GO TO SLEEP” were carved into Ashley’s chest.

 

 

 

Somewhere Far Away…

 

Jeff walked down a backroad, blood still wet on his hoodie. His hands were cut. His eyes wild.

 

He didn’t say a word.

 

Didn’t smile now.

 

Just walked into the fog, unbothered by the world behind him.

 

There was no reason for the slaughter.

 

No twisted manifesto.

 

No calling card.

 

Just a ghost with a knife, and an appetite for pain.

 

And the trail was only just beginning.

Somewhere in the Outskirts of Oregon

 

A full moon hung low over the treeline, casting pale silver across the wet asphalt. Jeff walked alone, his footsteps soft and barefoot against the road. The hoodie clung to him, soaked through from the drizzle. Blood—not his—still freckled the cuffs.

 

He hadn’t eaten In two days. He didn’t feel hunger.

 

He hadn’t slept in four. He didn’t feel tired.

 

He just moved.

 

He reached a telephone pole, layered in old stapled flyers and warped tape.

 

One new flyer caught his eye—its corners pristine, untouched by rain.

 

Black background. White text. Simple, brutal font.

 

“JEFF, IF YOU’RE OUT THERE… WE SEE YOU. WE WORSHIP YOU.

 

THE HARVEST IS READY. COME HOME.

 

TONIGHT. 11PM.

255 GOSPEL ROAD – THE BASEMENT.”

 

 

 

Under the message was a crude, hand-drawn sketch of Jeff’s face: white skin, black hair, and that eternal grin. But exaggerated—godlike, stylized, with rays coming off his head like a halo. Below it, an altar made of knives.

 

Jeff tilted his head.

 

Something flickered in his eyes—amusement? Curiosity? Contempt?

 

He ripped the flyer down and crumpled it slowly in his hand.

 

He looked up.

 

The road stretched on. Empty. Silent.

 

Then—he turned around.

 

And started walking toward Gospel Road.

Gospel Road – 10:58 PM

 

The gravel under Jeff’s bare feet crunched like shattered bone. The rain had stopped, but the fog lingered—low and thick, clinging to the earth like rot in the lungs. Pine trees formed tall, silent sentinels on both sides of the one-lane road that led nowhere. Except here.

 

255 Gospel Road was an old church.

 

Abandoned. Black mold kissed the sides. A broken cross hung sideways over the warped doors. Every stained-glass window had been painted over in red and black. Spray-painted. Finger-painted. Blood-painted.

 

The front door creaked open before Jeff touched it.

 

He stepped inside.

 

Candles lined the pews, arranged in symmetrical rows like soldiers before a holy war. Dozens of men and women knelt on prayer cushions—bodies trembling, breathing in sync, dressed in white robes soaked through with what looked like animal blood. Or not. Some had knives drawn across their own arms. Some had teeth missing. Some had eyes scratched out.

 

They did not look up.

 

At the altar stood a man. His voice low. Preaching.

 

“He does not die. He does not forgive.

He sees. He wants.

Jeff is salvation through pain.

Jeff is the blade in the dark.

Jeff is the scream in the lungs of children.”

 

 

 

Jeff’s footsteps echoed as he moved up the aisle, slow, deliberate.

 

Finally, someone noticed him.

 

A sharp inhale. A cry. A shudder. Like they’d seen a god.

 

The preacher at the altar froze mid-sentence.

 

“…He is with us.”

 

 

 

The congregation turned in unison. Dozens of eyes widened in rapture. Mouths hung open, trembling with something between awe and terror. Someone dropped to all fours and wept. Another screamed, over and over, “He came! He came! He came!”

 

Jeff just stared at them.

 

Silent. Motionless. His grin split open just a little wider.

 

The preacher approached, holding a ceremonial dagger with both hands—his voice was reverent, breathless:

 

“Jeff… Savior of the Cut. We’ve killed in your name. We’ve sacrificed. We’ve bled our children into the basin behind the altar. We’ve kept the legend alive.”

 

 

 

He offered the knife.

 

Jeff tilted his head, the flickering candlelight dancing in his lidless eyes. He took the dagger with one hand.

 

Then sliced the preacher’s throat with one clean motion.

 

The man gurgled, fell forward, blood spilling over the altar.

 

Screams. Ecstasy. Wailing. Worship.

 

No one ran.

 

They cheered.

 

Jeff leapt from the altar, moving like a panther, and began the slaughter.

 

He tore through the congregation like they were nothing. Robes turned red. Arms severed. Mouths slit open into mockeries of his smile. Someone tried to crawl away—he grabbed them by the spine and cracked it like firewood.

 

A young woman clutched at his ankle, sobbing, “Make me like you… please…”

 

He dragged her up, stared into her with something like disdain, then stabbed her eyes out and let her stumble blindly through the chaos.

 

He didn’t speak.

 

Didn’t need to.

 

They’d worshiped the idea of Jeff—the icon, the symbol.

 

But Jeff?

 

Jeff was no god.

 

He was a butcher. A phantom. A punishment.

 

And now—he painted his chapel in flesh.

 

When it was over, the candles still flickered. Red wax ran like veins down the pews. Limbs were strewn across the floor like confetti. Blood soaked the hymnals, the altar, the walls. The ceiling.

 

Jeff stood among the corpses. Breathing. Smiling.

 

He looked up at the crucifix, bent and broken.

 

Then he dipped a finger in blood and wrote on the wall behind the altar:

 

“NO GOD.

ONLY ME.”

 

 

 

And then—he walked out the front door.

 

Into the fog. Into the dark.

 

Into what came next.

The Man with No Routine

 

Jeff doesn’t sleep. Not really.

 

He lies still in motels or abandoned homes, eyes wide open, smiling at the ceiling, listening to the pipes creak and the bugs whisper. Sleep is a waste. Dreams are dead. His mind loops images of screaming faces and choking sobs like lullabies.

 

When he’s not killing, he wanders.

 

Not aimlessly. With hunger. Like a shark in shallow water.

 

 

 

10:03 AM – Gas Station, Middle of Nowhere

 

He stands in the snack aisle.

 

Grimy hoodie up. A hood that hasn’t been washed in years. His pale face and surgical grin visible just beneath the shadows. The cashier doesn’t see him yet. He stares at a row of candy bars, motionless.

 

Then he picks one.

 

Three Musketeers.

 

He doesn’t eat it. He just peels the wrapper back slowly, tearing the silver like skin. He drops the bar on the floor. Steps on it. Smears it into the tile with his boot. Walks out.

 

The cashier sees him too late.

 

“Hey! You—! You gonna pay for that?”

 

 

 

Jeff stops in the doorway. Tilts his head.

 

Smiles.

 

Doesn’t say a word.

 

Then keeps walking.

 

The cashier locks the door behind him and doesn’t come out for twenty minutes.

 

 

 

12:17 PM – School Playground Fence

 

He watches the kids from behind the trees. Not with desire. With curiosity.

 

He watches the arguments. The pushing. The laughter. The hierarchy of recess. It’s a foreign language to him.

 

He was a child once. But that life died with his family.

 

Now he watches children with the cold interest a spider has when a fly buzzes near the web. Not ready to strike—just studying.

 

A girl cries after falling from the monkey bars.

 

The teacher rushes to her.

 

Jeff mimics the motion. Pretends to kneel. Cradles an invisible child. Then mimics snapping her neck. Smiles wider.

 

He walks away. No one sees him.

 

 

 

2:00 PM – Abandoned Shopping Mall

 

He squats on the edge of the second floor, staring down at the empty fountain below.

 

He finds a pigeon nesting in a fake potted plant. It flaps and coos as he reaches in, then grabs it by the throat.

 

He stares at it.

 

“Sssshhh.”

 

 

 

He plucks the wings off first. Then the beak. Then the eyes.

 

Doesn’t smile. Doesn’t react.

 

Just leaves the ruined thing there.

 

He tapes its wings to a manikin nearby.

 

“Now you can fly,” he whispers.

 

Then he laughs.

 

Just once.

 

A quick, sharp sound. A child’s laugh. Ends suddenly.

 

 

 

4:39 PM – Dollar Store Bathroom

 

He stands in front of a mirror, razor blade in hand. Not shaving. Just carving.

 

He runs the blade under his eyes. Keeps his face bloodless, but fresh. Maintains the smile. He doesn’t want it to fade.

 

He whispers to himself.

 

“Smile wide. Smile wide. Smile wide.”

 

 

 

Someone knocks on the bathroom door. Jeff doesn’t answer.

 

Five minutes later, he walks out and drops the bloody razor in a toy donation bin.

 

The employee finds it an hour later and cries.

 

 

 

6:15 PM – Motel Room #13

 

He flips through channels.

 

Finds an old cartoon playing. Bugs Bunny, black and white. Jeff leans forward, fascinated. Laughs once when Elmer Fudd gets hit with a hammer. His expression is unreadable.

 

Then he screams at the screen.

 

Not because of anything in the show.

 

Just because he can.

 

The motel neighbor bangs on the wall. “Keep it down!”

 

Jeff stops. Stares at the wall.

 

Five minutes later, he’s picking the lock to the neighbor’s room. No blade this time.

 

Just his hands.

 

He doesn’t kill the neighbor.

 

He sits on the man’s chest and tells him to scream.

 

Every time the man screams, Jeff smiles wider.

 

Until his face hurts.

 

Then he leaves. Not because he’s done—but because the urge to kill hasn’t risen yet.

 

 

 

10:12 PM – Walking the Tracks

 

Jeff walks the train tracks in silence. Headphones in. Music playing.

 

It’s Beethoven. Moonlight Sonata.

 

He walks in perfect time with the rhythm, boots crunching gravel in tempo.

 

There’s blood on his shirt. Not fresh. Not explained.

 

His fingers twitch.

 

He’s thinking.

 

Not about guilt. Not about purpose.

 

He’s thinking about the next scream. The next pair of lungs he’ll collapse. The next child he’ll leave faceless. The next family he’ll ruin just to feel something.

 

Jeff doesn’t rest.

 

Jeff doesn’t eat.

 

Jeff doesn’t live.

 

He waits.

 

For another dark night, another open door, another soul he can rip apart just to hear the wet snap of hope breaking in half.

 

 THE SCHOOLTEACHER

 

11:03 PM – A Suburban Neighborhood

 

The house is small, pale green, and quiet. A wind chime dangles lazily on the porch. Jeff stands across the street, his hands in his hoodie pocket, eyes locked on the window where the light is still on. Room on the left. Second floor.

 

He watches.

 

A schoolteacher. Mrs. Delaney. First grade. Beloved.

 

She stayed late grading papers, then came home to wine and a book.

 

Jeff already knows her schedule.

 

She posts on Instagram. Dinners. Class projects. Smiling selfies with children who adore her.

 

He doesn’t smile tonight.

 

Tonight, he’s the thing at the window.

 

 

 

11:27 PM – The Break-In

 

She’s brushing her teeth when he enters.

 

He’s already inside by the time she hears the door creak.

 

“Hello? Is someone there?”

 

 

 

She calls out once. Just once.

 

Jeff says nothing.

 

He lets the silence do the work. He moves like fog. Silent. Cold.

 

She moves down the stairs, phone flashlight trembling in her hand.

 

Then she sees it.

 

The front door’s open. Just a crack. But she remembers locking it.

 

“I’m calling the police,” she says, voice trembling.

 

 

 

Jeff steps out from the shadows behind her.

 

She doesn’t have time to scream.

 

 

 

The Kill – Deserved Nothing, Received the Worst

 

He doesn’t use a knife this time.

 

He uses a pair of safety scissors. Found in her teacher tote bag.

 

It’s slow. It’s messy. Her blood paints the motivational posters on her living room wall.

 

“Kindness is Contagious!”

 

 

 

He carves her face—not to copy his, but to ruin hers. He cuts her lips back, wide, jagged, exposing teeth she used to smile with when children got math problems right.

 

He whispers as she dies:

 

“Smile for the class.”

 

 

 

Then he laughs.

 

And keeps laughing.

 

Until there’s no one left to hear it.

 

 

 

4:00 AM – The Display

 

He drags her body to the school.

 

Knows the security cameras don’t work—he’s been here before. A week ago. Scouting.

 

He hangs her from the monkey bars.

 

Upside down.

 

Arms spread wide like wings.

 

He takes her school ID badge and pins it to her chest.

 

Then he pulls a red marker from her own desk—writes “Class Dismissed” on the blacktop beneath her, in foot-high letters.

 

Jeff walks off into the dark before sunrise.

 

 

 

7:45 AM – Screams and Sirens

 

The children find her first.

 

A little boy named Eli throws up. A girl runs until she falls. A parent faints.

 

The cops arrive.

 

The reporters swarm.

 

The teachers weep.

 

There’s no rhyme or reason. No message. Just horror.

 

And in the crowd, somewhere blocks away—Jeff watches.

 

Hood up. Smile wide. Cotton candy in hand from a street vendor.

 

Eating it like a child at a fair.

 

Eyes twinkling.

 

Watching the grief ripple like fire across a field.

JEFF – THE CULT

 

Abandoned Church – Edge of Town – Midnight

 

The church looks like it’s been empty for decades.

 

Vines crawl over shattered stained glass. The bell tower leans with rot. Pews lie in splinters. A dead crow rests at the threshold.

 

Jeff stands at the door, staring.

 

He didn’t knock.

 

He never knocks.

 

Inside: twelve people in hand-stitched masks, some homemade, some carved from wood, all painted with crude, smiling faces.

 

At the center is a ring of candles. Pig’s blood in a bowl. Carved bones. The scent of rotting fruit and metal.

 

They call themselves The Laughing Faithful.

 

They call him The Hollow Smile.

 

 

 

“We’ve been waiting.”

 

The lead cultist—young, maybe twenties, gaunt—removes her mask.

 

Eyes wide. Pupils dilated like she’s seen God. She trembles.

 

“We heard the news. The teacher. We knew it was you. We always know.”

 

 

 

Jeff steps into the circle.

 

The candles flicker like they recognize him.

 

He stares.

 

Silent.

 

One of them begins chanting.

 

Another starts sobbing, overwhelmed.

 

Jeff lifts a single finger to his lips.

 

Shhhhhh.

 

 

 

Silence.

 

Then he speaks.

 

 

 

“Why?”

 

His voice cuts like wire.

 

“Why me?”

 

 

 

They answer in gasps:

 

“You’re the one who woke up.” “You’re the first face I saw in the dark.” “You make the world honest.”

 

 “You’re beautiful.”

 

 

 Jeff tilts his head at that last one. A mock pout.

 

Then a smile. The real one. The only one.

 

“I’m not your god,” he says.

 They freeze.

 He steps forward and grabs the kneeling one by the face, fingers digging into his jaw.

 “But I’ll take your devotion.”

 He spares them.

 Not because he’s merciful.

 Because he sees the utility.

 “You want to serve?”

 They nod.

 He paces the room like a wolf inspecting a kennel.

 “Then do what I can’t. Go places I don’t want to. Be my eyes. My hands. My little laughs in the crowd.” 

He kneels beside the blood bowl and dips a finger into it. Smears it across the forehead of a cultist in the shape of a smile.

 “Make me a myth.”

 They chant softly, almost reverently.

 “Smile… Smile… Smile…”

He stops at the door and turns his head.

“Start with hospitals. Schools. Libraries. Places people feel safe.”

 

 

 

“That’s where the lies live.”

 

 

 

Then he’s gone.

 

The doors swing open on their own.

Me: ""Yes.""
Then she rejected me.

I’m confused because the way she was talking to me before, I thought she might say yes. Her tone and responses felt playful and warm, but maybe I misread it?

Why do girls ask things like “is it a date?” or “are you interested?” if they already know they’re going to say no? Is that just to make it clear for themselves?

How can I tell if a girl would actually say yes based on her actions, not just words? I’m trying to understand what green flags or subtle signs I might have missed.

1m2g1p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m2g1p2/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_fellow_corvo_pro/,Explore the best electric kettle Fellow Corvo Pro worth the hype,"Using the Fellow Corvo EKG Pro 1171PRO-BY has become a seamless part of my daily life over the past few weeks. As someone who loves both tea and a good French press coffee, finding the right electric kettle that combines speed, precision, and ease of use felt like a challenge—until I came across this gorgeous piece of equipment. It’s not just its functionality; the sleek design and hazy blue finish with maple accents make this kettle a standout addition to my kitchen counter, effortlessly blending style with utility.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is the first thing that drew me to the Corvo EKG Pro. Its brushed finish and minimalist aesthetic scream premium. The hazy blue color paired with maple accents on the handle and lid pull give it a sophisticated and modern vibe, which feels more like an artisanal product than a standard kitchen appliance. Its compact dimensions—8.66” L x 6.69” W x 7.72” H—make it unobtrusive, even in smaller kitchen spaces, yet it offers a generous capacity of 0.9 liters. The 304 stainless steel build feels sturdy and high-quality, while the silicone and plastic details ensure the handle and exterior stay cool to the touch. It’s the kind of kettle that has everyone asking, “Where did you get that?”

**Ease of Use and Features**  
The standout feature, for me, is the precise temperature control. Whether I’m brewing green tea at 180°F or boiling water for some pasta, having the ability to set temperatures to-the-degree is a game-changer. Pair that with the large, intuitive LCD color screen, and making adjustments is as simple as turning a dial. Features like scheduling and altitude settings make it easy to integrate this kettle into daily routines. One evening, I scheduled it for early morning use, and waking up to a fresh boil was such a treat!

[Check Fellow Corvo EKG Pro 1171PRO-BY price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Performance and Speed**  
The speed at which this kettle warms water is impressive. Whether it’s a quick pour-over or a full pot for cooking, the heating element works efficiently and quietly. The rapid boiling time doesn’t mean sacrificing precision either—it delivers exactly the right temperature, ensuring my green tea never gets scalded and my French press coffee is brewed just right. The addition of a Brew Stopwatch lets me time steeping for drinks like tea or coffee perfectly, which I’ve found particularly useful during those laid-back Sunday mornings.

**Upsides**  
- Intuitive temperature control.  
- Eye-catching design that doubles as kitchen decor.  
- Thoughtful features like altitude adjustment, scheduling, and Guide Mode for preset temperatures.  
- Ergonomic handle and wide spout that offer comfortable, controlled pours.  

**Caveats**  
- The kettle’s exterior needs occasional cleaning to manage fingerprints, despite its brushed finish.  
- Mineral deposits form over time, requiring manual descaling as it’s not dishwasher safe.  

**Care and Maintenance**  
I quickly learned the importance of keeping up with regular cleaning. While the kettle is touted as dishwasher safe, I found hand-washing to be more effective for longevity. Using water in a hard water area left noticeable mineral deposits at the bottom. I simply followed the suggested method of removing these with a vinegar solution, and it was good as new. Maintenance aside, this kettle is an easy appliance to care for.

**Product Competitors**  
Before settling on this one, I explored a few alternatives. For example, the Breville BKE820XL had similar temperature control options but lacked the distinct artistic design I was looking for. Gooseneck kettles, like the Stagg EKG, also caught my attention, but they are tailored more for pour-over coffee rather than multipurpose boiling. The Corvo EKG Pro, to its credit, bridges the gap between precision-focused coffee drinkers and everyday users. The competitors may share similarities, yet none quite matched the perfect mix of style, functionality, and attention to detail.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering all its features and premium design, this kettle offers excellent value. Subpar kettles often lack temperature precision or durability, making this one feel like an investment piece that will hold up over years of use. Added features like Wi-Fi firmware updates and a two-year warranty (extendable with registration) further justify its slightly premium positioning.

1m2fyqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/1m2fyqn/powell_memo_of_71/,Powell Memo of '71,"Are the folks from this community familiar with this man or memo? Have I lost my mind, or did I just find the smoking gun to sum up 90% of the issues in this nation? Well, the issue for 98% of us.



**Who was Lewis Powell**: Former corporate lawyer from Big Tobacco, who unsuccessfully tried to argue that executives from PhillIp Morris were protected under their first amendment rights to lie to the public regarding how unsafe their products. What a guy! After that, he became a Supreme Court justice for 15 years - gross, but also relevant to where this vignette is going.



**What did Lewis Powell do prior to becoming a SCJ:** He wrote a confidential letter (oops) to the US Chamber of Commerce titled Attack On America Free Enterprise. It's long and boring, but I cut and pasted a link to it below. In short: *Business is under attack by the media and by the working class, it's time to fight back by mobilizing corporations politically (buy politicians), infiltrate education and media, and to play the long game.*



**Post Powell memo, from 1971-1981:** PAC's (the less evil brother of SuperPAC's) were first created in the early 70',s and money started to flow heavily into the pockets of politicians from unelected officials. Mid to late 70's marked the birth of Think Tanks - Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and others started having influence and persuasion over the media and education. By the very late 80's (with Powell on Supreme Court) unions were beginning to lose power. There’s a lot more but Im trying to keep it somewhat brief.



**The Reagan Years:** In January of '81, Reagan was handed a 1000 Page document from The Heritage Foundation, titled Mandate for Leadership (essentially Powell Memo playbook) - it had ""over 2000"" recommendations in it to cut taxes for the wealthy, deregulate, take down unions - basically anything to help the top but hurt everyone else. Reagan adopted nearly ⅔ of these 2000 recommendations in his first 12 months in the White House. Reagan also gutted public schools, killed universal basic healthcare (google operation coffee cup), massively slashed corporate tax, and IMO the greatest offense of all: He allowed for a rule change with the SEC. Buybacks were now legal. So what, right? Well, they are a form of market manipulation and were illegal prior to Reagan. They are also a form of millionaire/billionaire socialism. That ""extra"" money used to go towards reinvestment, higher wages, and R&D. Now? It's a way for the CEO's and those with portfolios, to pay themselves and manipulate the market. In 2024, the total # of corporate buybacks hit just shy of $1 trillion dollars - but screw your medical bills, am I right?



This was all sold as Freedom and Progress!!! The opposite? Socialism!!! And we bought it up and still do today.



So, if anyone wonders why so many more people could afford a home then, why kids were doing better than their parents, why we didn't have billionaires, why the wealth disparity wasn't nearly what we have today...its not really that hard to figure out. Or maybe I've turned into a conspiratorial nut...? Idk, never heard of this power memo up until about a week ago, and I've been deep down the rabbit hole ever since.



I'm not a socialist. I'm not anti getting rich or even anti billionaires. I'm pro American, anti-partisan, and wish more people got a fair shake. What we had prior to Reagan was not socialism. It was sustainable capitalism, and unless we bring back some policies (or comparable) from that era and fast - we're going to continue to rot as a nation from the inside out.

""Evil doesn’t knock here.""

 

The heat was different here. Arizona’s sun didn’t beat down so much as it hung overhead — oppressive and unwavering, like it was watching.

 

5122 East Preakness Drive wasn’t much to look at on paper. A quiet, unassuming house in a working-class neighborhood where the street curved into itself like a question mark. Patches of gravel and sun-bleached turf lined the yard. The place had a sagging front porch, a faint creak in the wood like an old man’s knee, and three windows that somehow looked like eyes—bored, bloodshot, and half-closed.

 

But for the first time in weeks… maybe months… it felt safe.

 

Lou’s boots thudded against the hardwood as he made his first walk-through. No traps. No sigils. No strange symbols clawed into the drywall. Just dust, silence, and potential. He didn’t smile — he never really did — but his shoulders sank just a little. That was enough.

 

The others filtered in behind him.

 

Martinez tossed a duffel to the floor with a grunt, flannel sleeves rolled high, sunglasses still on despite the shade. “Bout time. This house smells like peace and old farts.”

 

Medina raised his eyebrows. “You sure it ain’t just you, man?”

 

They laughed. Even Lou cracked half a grin.

 

Then came Kaede.

 

She stepped over the threshold like it burned. The girl from a cursed land, a cursed time. Japan’s shadow still clung to her like wet cloth. Her sandals didn’t make a sound against the floor.

 

She paused in the doorway of the living room, looking around the space as if she were standing in the future. Ceiling fan spinning. Couch stained with old coffee. A flat screen still mounted on the wall like a half-forgotten shrine.

 

“It’s so… quiet,” she said in halting English, her accent tinged with the hushed reverence of someone who expected this to vanish any second. Her fingers brushed the kitchen counter. “No shadows here.”

 

“No,” Lou said, arms crossed. “Not yet.”

 

Outside, the street breathed a different kind of silence. Neighbors mowed lawns. A kid rode a scooter past, trailed by a barking mutt. No one screamed. No one bled. The world was ordinary — so painfully normal it felt like a dream stitched together with dental floss.

 

Kaede sat on the back steps that night as the sun sank behind the low desert hills. The sky went orange, then bruised purple, then black. Cactus silhouettes cut jagged shapes into the horizon. Vega sat beside her, cracking a beer, nodding toward the sky.

 

“Ever see a sky like this where you’re from?” he asked.

 

She shook her head slowly. “No. It’s too clean. It doesn’t feel haunted.”

 

He laughed. “Give it time.”

 

Inside, Lou reviewed files under low lamp light. Photos of the Goatman, The rake, even that blurred image of Slender Man… they were filed away now. Survivors. Ghosts. Wounds in a folder.

 

And under them all… one name, redacted. A name he hadn’t seen in a long time. One he never spoke.

 

The page was blank where the face should be. But he saw it anyway — pale. Grinning. Burned into him like acid.

 

Jeff.

 

But not yet. Not here.

 

For now, the house at 5122 E Preakness breathed quietly in the dark, as if savoring the illusion of peace.

 

And for a moment, just a moment — they all believed it

 

 

INT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE – NIGHT

 

Flickering candlelight. Mismatched furniture. Flies buzz near a bloated, unrecognizable corpse. The house reeks of rot, anger, and old violence.

 

Newspapers line the walls. Clippings of missing persons. Murders with no suspects. Violent scribbles scrawled across the floorboards.

 

A knife glints In the low light.

 

Footsteps drag across hardwood like a body being pulled.

 

From the shadows steps Jeff the Killer.

 

Hair wild. Eyes too wide. Smile cut deep into flesh like a permanent joke.

 

He crouches before a mirror shattered by a punch months ago.

 

His voice is a whisper wrapped in static:

 

Jeff (to himself):

“They’re all so quiet now… why do they go so quiet when they die?”

 

He pauses.

 

Then tilts his head, as if hearing something distant. Not words — instinct.

 

Jeff (softly):

“Something’s changed…”

 

A chuckle, then silence.

 

But he doesn’t know.

 

Not yet.

 

He doesn’t know his brother is alive.

 

He doesn’t know what’s waiting for him.

 

Not yet.

* *OOF*, that was a rough start! That transition from the end of the last episode into Clary making aggressive eye contact with the camera while saying the exact same thing, only she's in a completely different room and chose to face away from Jace and Magnus for some reason, but only to say that one sentence and then turn around to face them. I'm sorry, but that moment was unforgivable
* Ok, so Clary has the ability to turn real objects into pictures, but Luke (who knew her mother really well for years) said that he's never been seen another Shadowhunter who can do that, so why does Clary think that her mom has the ability to do it?
* It was during this opening scene that I realized that Clary feels like she's always at 110% percent energy, which I suppose is understandable for the character, but must've really sucked for the actress. Seriously, the girl is always out of breath and gesticulating wildly in like every conversation
* I appreciate Magnus cutting Jace off, because the amount of times we've heard a Shadowhunter rant about what horrors will befall the Shadow World if Valentine gets the Cup is bordering on excessive
* Why did Luke wait till then to join the conversation? It's not like he was still on bed rest, he had already risen to his feet during his conversation with Clary in the last episode. So Clary gets this epiphany about where the Cup is, storms out of the room to tell Jace and Magnus, and Luke just stayed standing by the bed for a solid minute before following her? And while we're on that note, where the heck did Alec go? Didn't Magnus convince him to stay for a drink at the end of the last episode?
* Ok, does this chick have no self respect? Simon ghosts her for days, then she goes to his house to confront him and he blows her off, then he presumably shows up at her house and they have sex?? Girl, I would say you deserve better than this, but honestly, I've seen no evidence that you actually *do* deserve better than this. She's such a worthless nothing of a character, I couldn't care less if Simon snapped and sucked her dry out of nowhere, just so she would finally be *gone*! Even so, I do feel *a little* bad for her when Simon called her Clary. That's not a wound you recover from. Honestly, I just hated this whole scene
* No joke, the minute Luke walked in the precinct, I said out loud ""Yeah, this dude's getting fired"", and then they immediately came to take his gun and badge 😂
* I get where Jace is coming from, with the ""let's just go invisible to get the cards"", but aren't there other werewolves in the precinct besides Luke? Do the invisibility runes work against Downworlders? Cause they don't work against other Shadowhunters
* What, *how*?! Why did Jace suddenly have zoom vision?! Is it a Shadowhunter thing? Why couldn't Clary see the badge?? I'm so confused! But also, them blue-brown *eyes*, baby! 😍
* Ok, so when you burn a rune on yourself, it just works all the time? That doesn't make sense, cause then Clary would still be invisible from the invisibility rune. Ok, so Jace must've activated that rune already, but why? Why did he think he would need a binoculars rune to get a deck of cards from the precinct? I like that rune tho, reminds me of the spider monkey from Spy Kids 2
* Just got the 2nd look at Izzy in the ""conservative"" dress, and still *so* gorgeous! I legit said ""*Oooh*"" out loud. I do however find it funny that Robert's reaction makes it seem like Izzy wearing clothes that actually cover her body is the equivalent of an identity crisis for her XD. Also, this is random, but I love her lipstick shade
* Wait, why does Izzy have the same rune twice? She's got the Shadowhunters symbol on both her right forearm and her chest. Why does she need it twice? What does it even do?
* Luke immediately lawyering up was intelligent and hot af, as was pretending to blow his nose to hide his mouth
* ""I'm not the only Downworlder on the force, and we don't know who could be working for Valentine."" *WHY* are Downworlders working for Valentine??? What does he offer them except experimentation and death?!?
* Uh, *no*, you were *not* at Magnus' place. Where was Alec during the Cup conversation if he slept at Magnus'? And if he was still there when they left in the morning to go get the Cup, why didn't he go with them? This timeline makes no sense!
* Ok, is it just me, or are the runes starting to look darker? It used to be that they were a pinkish-red, like a burn scar, until they were activated, but now they look a lot more dark red or gray. Heck, Alec's neck rune is nearly *black*! What happened?? They were not like that before
* This is purely a personal gripe, but I *hate* the way that Alec says ""cocktail"". He pronounces the O like an A and it's driving me up the wall 🤣
* Ok Izzy, you telling Alec everything about your personal life does not make you entitled to hear about his. There's nothing ""unfair"" about someone not wanting to tell you something when it has nothing to do with you. I say this as a sister with an older brother, you're being a moron right now
* What do you mean you broke up with Meliorn? There was *literally no* indication that they were anything more than sex buddies and occasional casual informants! Where was there ever any dating or romance?? Get over yourself and find a new bunkmate. Maybe Simon, I hear he's hoeing himself out these days
* Ok, Izzy, can you think about *anything* other than sex?? Maybe I'm too old for this show, cause there are times where it feels really high school coded
* This is a trope I will never understand. They had literally all the time in the world for Clary to clue Jace in on her plan, there was no reason to catch him off guard and leave him scrambling to join in on her improv
* I'm not usually a fan of the ""two characters pretend to be a couple having a fight"" trope, but Jace putting on the D-bag act and calling her ""babe"" was super funny XD. The ""I have rights"" had me rolling!
* I don't understand how the fake fight helped the situation. How did loudly announcing your presence help them avoid potential Valentine cronies? They know who Clary is and they probably know who Jace is and they'll know that this fight is utter bullhockey, so what even was the point? If they were just gonna walk through the middle of the bullpen, why didn't Clary just walk in alone at a normal pace and tell the chief the same excuse she ended up giving her anyway, that she needed Luke's spare house key? The whole fake fight seems so unnecessary. Also, Didn't Clary's loft burn down? Why would she need a key to it?
* What kind of food truck serves both coffee in glass cups with an actual French press thing and garlic bagels? Also, Simon is left handed
* This is random, but the IA guy is kinda hot. Very DILF
* ""I'm sorry, I panicked."" How do you have a plan and literally panic right out the gate?! Slapping him was the first thing you did!!
* Can Alec and Jace stop being pissed at each other? I'm so over it!
* Does every fantasy universe have their own version of the ""(specific creature from this universe) Pox""? Doesn't Harry Potter have a Dragon Pox? I'm pretty sure Star Trek has 2 or 3 of these
* Magnus was literally a part of the conversation before they went to get the Cup. If portalling in to get it was an option, why didn't they just do that the first time? It's not like he's against them getting the Cup
* And here is yet *another* trope I can't stand, the ""all of this would be solved if I just came right out and said what I mean instead of dancing around it until I run out of time"" thing. Seriously, Simon, 7 words: ""I think I'm turning into a vampire""
* Hearing IA Daddy say ""dude"" was interesting XD
* ""She was my friend."" ""One of the few."" *Geez*! That was so out of pocket 🤣
* I can already tell that IA Daddy isn't gonna stick around long, but I like him. He's the normal guy who's just trying to do his job and save some people, and because he's on the outside of what's really going on, that unfortunately just makes him an obstacle to the protagonists. If anyone here is a Supernatural fan, he's the Victor Henriksen of Shadowhunters
* Ok, I'm confused. Why would IA Daddy asks if the chief's death was another demonic murder, if he immediately after proves that he doesn't know about demons by saying that it was impossible for her to have been dead for a couple hours if he talked to her just 45 minutes ago. If this guy doesn't know about demons, then why is he asking about ""demonic murders""?
* I googled MD Facebook for funsies, but didn't find anything nearly as interesting as what Simon's looking at lol
* I know I should be reeling a bit more from the reveal that Simon apparently has a sister that's never been mentioned before, but I just can't get over how *wild* the top that Simon's mom is wearing is! That thing is *insane* looking! It's looks like something you'd where to a gender reveal party
* Ok, if Simon wasn't so distracted with the whole metamorphosis thing, his ego would be way more bruised by his sister describing him as ""a spaz with girls"" 🤣
* Soooooooooooooooo, Simon's family is definitely dead, right? And probably that other chick too? Like, there's no way they all survive this. Either Simon is going to snap and kill them in a moment of bloodlust, or Camille is going to kill them in an effort to leave Simon no one to turn to except her
* Alaric being in the elevator that Clary and Jace were gonna use was incredibly predictable, as was the incredibly overdone cliche of ""I'm gonna keep looking down just long enough for the people in my eyeline to disappear and somehow not be suspicious by any rustling noises or shoe scuffs they would've had to make to move that fast"" 🙄
* And yet another moment where the show is very clearly high school coded, with Jace stepping in *reeeeeeeeeeeal* close to draw the Nyx rune. So close that it makes drawing the rune even harder XD
* ""It's good practice. You know, for asking out Magnus?"" Yes Alec, go pretend to be straight so you can get good practice for being gay, cause that makes all the sense in the world 🙄
* ""You do this sort of stuff all the time"".........................................................What? That is just categorically false, why would Izzy even say that? What even was the point of a line so astronomically inaccurate??
* So, I'm confused. Alec had to cause a distraction so Izzy could sneak past and turn off the power, but why wouldn't she just go invisible to sneak past the Mundane desk clerk? They say it's because someone working for Valentine would be able to see through their disguise, but how does it help them to be visible to *everyone*? They *still* have to try and hide from any of Valentine's cronies who would definitely pick them out as Shadowhunters, so why not make themselves at least invisible to the Mundanes and make that part of the mission less complicated? I don't understand how being visible to everyone helps slip under the radar better
* I did not like the Nyx rune effect, that looked stupid. It takes a lot to make Dominic Sherwood look dumb, but that accomplished it
* ""Give me a heads up next time you're gonna do that"" Do what? What did she do and why was he mad about it? I'm so confused
* Yeah, I'm with Jace, it is so not the time to be reminiscing over photos in a box. It was also at this moment that I again thought about just how much easier this whole thing would've been if they'd just asked Magnus to portal straight in and out. It's not as if he has no stake in this, he wants to keep Valentine from getting the Cup as much as they do
* Ok, the necklace did a thing. I will not be surprised if it's gone in the next episode, never to be seen again
* The way they got Clary separated from the other 3 was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid. And that ""guys, slow down 🥺"" was so pathetic
* Jace stabbing the grandma was really funny cause I couldn't help but think about how that must've been like to film! They literally hired some little old lady for Dom to walk up to, grab the back of her head, and pretend to stab her, that must've been so funny! 🤣
* Alec making his arrows reappear was really cool, though I'm not sure what he did with his hand to make to happen
* ""Don't worry, it's not like this is the first time Alec has saved your life."" Uhhhhhhhhh, ok? Where is that coming from? Why are you suddenly pissed at Clary? What did she do, this episode is just confusing me more and more by the second
* Simon's actor (Alberto something, I think?) really sold that breaking down scene, although the vampire teeth looked really stupid, but that's not his fault. They lowkey made him look like an ogre
* Seriously, Clary?? NOW is the time for a heart to heart?!?
* Seriously, does *nobody* have Magnus' phone number to call for an evac??? Alec's got his number, oh wait, we left him rather than call for help from the warlock that can LITERALLY SAVE OUR LIVES! Honestly, it's hard to really feel the tension when there's such an easy solution available that they just aren't using cause ""it would be awkward""
* Great idea to leave Clary on her own when she literally doesn't even have a weapon 🤦‍♀️
* Ok, I'm not gonna lie, when they said the Mortal Cup lets you ""control demons"", I was expecting something way cooler than just giving them a command while holding it
* Simon's mom is acting weirdly nonchalant considering she just recently watch her son break his entire desk in half. And she is *still* wearing that top!
* \*my reaction to Clary finding Jace again\* Nope! Don't trust it, don't trust it, don't trust it!
* Why did Clary put the Cup down for even a second. You are *surrounded* by demons! The Cup controls them! It is your greatest weapon!! Why would you put it in your bag?!?!
* Ok, where did she get a sword and why didn't she use it before?!? WHAT?!?! WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST HAVE IT OUT INSTEAD OF THE WITCHLIGHT?? WHY WAS IT HER INSTINCT TO REACH FOR THE CUP CARD BEFORE THE ACTUAL WEAPON?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
* Her stabbing fake Jace was hot (Yes I have a competency kink, we've established this), and it is a crime that no one else was there to see it
* I don't trust this Luke and Alec either! And I don't know enough about demons yet to know if they can take the memories of the people they impersonate, and neither does Clary (edit: ok, well screw me, I guess)
* ""Right now Clary is the only thing that matters""......................................and also Alec.......................your parabatai kinda matters too
* ""I didn't see you, I was worried something might've happened"" Yeah, maybe that's because you sent her off on her own without a weapon, except she apparently *did* have a weapon and just DIDN'T use it!
* I liked that scene between Jace and Clary. The banter was natural and flirtatious without being overdone, and they didn't kiss until they'd actually conveyed the necessary info instead of putting it all aside to have an untimely moment. I still think they were unnecessarily close before the kissing started, but that's forgivable. Also, is this their first kiss? The moment was hyped up like it was the first, but I could've sworn they've kissed before
* At this point, I am so over Simon's vampire story *already*. I don't even know what to say other than this is going to be super annoying. I don't necessarily *blame* Simon, but also, ***ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh***
* Ok, so Simon was *turning* into a vampire, but it would've faded and he'd still be human if he hadn't return to DuMort for Camille to finish the process? I'm assuming we're gonna get more info in the next episode, but I find this cliffhanger to be more confusing than compelling
* My general thoughts on the episode was that the first half was really boring and the second half was annoying and riddled with plot holes. The one thing I can't get over is how pointless the entire episode was. With Magnus' help, literally nothing that happened would've happen. Heck, Vargas might've even still been alive because they're would've been no reason for demons to infiltrate the precinct when they did. It puts the episode in a weird place of literally being when we finally find the Mortal Cup, while also making the entire thing feel like a filler episode. All of that added together makes me give this a 4/10. It wasn't the worst episode so far, and I don't hate it *nearly* as much as I hated Dead Man's Party, but to have that many obvious plot holes in what should've been a pivotal episode makes it unforgivably bad 

Favorite lines:

* ""It'd be like Beyonce riding on a dinosaur through Times Square; people would notice.""
* ""Still waiting on Valentine's thank you card.""
* ""It sounded boring anyway.""",2,1752778191.0,shadowhunters,0,1.0,False

HOLD ME BACK!,"michael kaiser looks like he was genetically engineered in a secret lab beneath a luxury hair salon and fed nothing but mirror selfies and the souls of instagram filters since birth, like how do you wake up every morning with that hair, that face, and that attitude and not get smited by a jealous god, i swear he doesn’t even sleep, he just reclines in a silk robe surrounded by scented candles and stares at his own reflection whispering ""perfection"" until the sun rises, this man walks like the world is his catwalk and talks like everyone’s beneath him, probably gets turned on by the sound of his own voice, he orders his coffee black with extra arrogance and makes baristas spell his name with a crown symbol instead of letters, and don't even get me started on his jawline, that thing could cut glass, cut egos, cut through the silence in a room and still smirk about it after, he flirts like it’s a threat, compliments you in a tone that makes you wonder if you should thank him or file a restraining order, he probably makes eye contact so intense you start confessing sins you didn’t know you committed, and the freakiest part? he knows. he *knows* he’s fine. he weaponizes it. he'll say something like ""you’re lucky i’m looking at you"" with that smirk and suddenly your clothes forget how buttons work, your phone battery dies, and your ancestors roll in their graves because they felt it, too. i bet he calls himself “a gift” and somehow you agree.

  
michael kaiser is the kind of man who would look you dead in the eyes, ask if you’ve ever been ruined before, and you’d laugh thinking he’s joking, but three business days later you’re staring at the ceiling questioning every decision you’ve ever made because now every other man looks like a background character in his shadow, like he doesn’t even walk, he *glides*, like his footsteps are too precious to touch the ground, probably moisturizes with the tears of those who can’t measure up and uses rejection letters as napkins, he’s got that face that makes you believe in reincarnation because surely you did something right in a past life just to breathe the same air as him, and don’t get too close or you’ll find out his cologne smells like seduction, broken promises, and luxury despair, like how dare he look like a fallen angel that charges appearance fees just to exist, his eyes got that arrogant sparkle that makes you feel like he already undressed your confidence and folded it neatly next to your pride, he’d say something like “i don’t chase, i collect” and suddenly you’re willingly handing over your soul in a glass case, and the thing is, he’d be soft-spoken, not loud, not messy, just calmly devastating, like an elegant apocalypse wearing silk, and he’d touch your chin once and suddenly you’re rearranging your entire five-year plan around being called his favorite, even though you *know* he’s a menace, a certified menace with cheekbones sharp enough to slice logic in half, who stares at people like he’s not evaluating them, but *judging* them, and enjoying it, and when he smirks? oh when he smirks, it’s not happiness, it’s a warning label, it’s a promise that you’ll never forget him, even when you try, even when you change your number, even when you move continents, he lives in the corners of your mind rent-free with his boots on your memories.

1m2fsnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m2fsnu/why_apoxcon_gw2_electric_coffee_percolator_review/,Why APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator Review Is Worth Your Attention,"Getting my hands on the APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator has been a game-changer for my morning routine. As someone who can barely function before the first cup of coffee, I've put this stainless steel beauty through its paces over the past few weeks. Right off the bat, it's clear this isn't your average coffee maker. It's a percolator, which adds a nostalgic charm to brewing while still packing modern features, ensuring it's more than a stylish countertop accessory.  

**Build Quality and Design**  
The APOXCON GW-2 is sturdy and feels premium with its food-grade 18/8 stainless-steel body. I’ve been impressed by how the stainless steel construction ensures the percolator stays spotless after multiple uses. No corners were cut in durability, as it even comes equipped with a borosilicate glass knob—something you rarely see today. The glass knob is heat-resistant, easily enduring temperatures from 0°F to 392°F without cracking—a solid win for anyone who loves checking their coffee perking in real time. Let’s not forget about the cool-touch handle; it’s a brilliant addition for people like me, who can’t handle piping hot equipment during busy mornings.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
Using this electric percolator has been incredibly straightforward, thanks to the intuitive on/off button. Brewing 6 to 12 cups of coffee is a breeze. It took me just under 7 minutes to brew a full 10 cups the other day, and the built-in ready-to-serve light indicator was super helpful. Bonus points for the automatic ""keep warm"" feature! I had a cup an hour later, and it was just as hot as when it was brewed—a lifesaver for long work-from-home days.  

[Check APOXCON GW-2 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d1cdx943/)  

**Advantages**  
- Durable stainless steel body that’s easy to clean.  
- Glass knob makes monitoring brewing progress simple.  
- Brews quickly, delivering 6 to 12 cups in minutes.  
- Automatic keep-warm function for extended convenience.  
- Plastic- and aluminum-free parts ensure healthier coffee.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The lid can feel a little tight when taking it off, especially when the percolator is hot.  
- I found the cord to be slightly shorter than expected, limiting placement options in the kitchen.  

**Does It Work for Everyone?**  
This model is clearly designed for those who prioritize both function and aesthetics. Families or coffee enthusiasts who need multiple cups will love its capacity. It’s also ideal if you’re conscious about the materials in contact with your coffee—everything here is plastic-free. However, if you’re a single person who drinks just one or two cups a day, this might seem like overkill.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing the APOXCON percolator to others in the market, such as the popular Presto 02822 or Farberware FCP240, I found this model more appealing for its all-stainless steel design. The Presto includes some plastic parts, which might be a dealbreaker for purists. On the flip side, Farberware has a slightly more compact design, though lacks the see-through glass knob many appreciate on the APOXCON. While other brands may hit the mark on portability, the heat-resistant features and sheer brewing consistency make this one a tough competitor to outshine.  

**Smart Spending**  
Is it worth the price? Definitely—if you’re after durability and consistently bold coffee. While this may not be the cheapest coffee percolator out there, its premium materials and extra safety features justify the cost. It feels like a long-term investment rather than a disposable appliance.

By half past five, I’m already in the kitchen, making breakfast as usual. This morning, though, she didn’t quite seem like herself in the stillness of that early hour.

The same mug with the little blue tulips — she adored those flowers. They take me back to the days of our young love, all those years ago. I placed the tulip mug beside her plate — still warm, still waiting. Two slices of buttered bread, and one of her favorite cinnamon sugar buns. She always said they tasted like Sunday mornings. I follow her recipe carefully every time, but it never tastes quite the same. The scent, the way it used to melt between your teeth — something’s missing. Still, I bake them the same way, even if she hasn’t taken a bite in weeks. I lay her pills on her favorite tea plate, the same old rhythm. She never takes them. I suppose she’s just tired of fighting.

She was supposed to water the tulips this morning — she used to care for her plants so tenderly. But today, she just sat there. So I did it for her. 
I walk through the garden and pass the rotten fruit beneath the trees, long since dead. I follow the grapevine path, but it no longer smells like summer. Now it carries only stillness — the heavy, stale air of a place left behind.
I come back inside. Her coffee’s gone cold. She hasn’t touched her breakfast. The room is freezing, yet she shows no reaction. Her expression — still the same. I sit by her side, as I always have.

I lean in and kiss her forehead. 
Her skin is ice cold.
I wrap her in her blanket, sit beside her, and whisper my goodnights.
Then I go to bed.

The next morning, I do the same. Her breakfast: two slices of buttered bread, one cinnamon sugar bun, and a cup of coffee, two sugars, no milk — just how she likes it. I sit by her with my plate on my thighs but I don’t take a single bite. My stomach no longer growls, my mouth no longer waters … All I have left is her.

And when the mornings start to rot like bruised pears, I’ll still lay beside her — sipping her bittersweet coffee, waiting for a voice I’ve long forgotten, yet still ache to hear.",2,1752777909.0,horrorwriters,0,0.75,False
1m2fqbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1m2fqbv/60m_coworker_has_no_boundaries_and_keeps/,60M coworker has no boundaries and keeps oversharing,"I work in an office where most of the time it’s just me and one other coworker, a man in his 60s. He is way too enthusiastic and has no sense of boundaries.

He keeps asking me to go out for coffee during work hours (I always reject and he keeps asking), talks endlessly about his past, and overshares his personal life including things like how his wife is actually his relative (?? why would I need to know that??). He even asked me to take him to JB (I rejected without hesitation). Sometimes he randomly sends me useless meme stickers for no reason, but nothing that’s actual harassment. He once asked me about my weight, whether I have a boyfriend, and at one point mocked me for supposedly “never having been kiss/hug with anyone”, even though I never actually answered his invasive questions and he just jumped to his own conclusions.

All this happens when it’s just the 2 of us in the office. Most of the time I just listen and react politely, and now I’m questioning if my reactions gave him the impression that I enjoy these conversations. This does not feel normal or appropriate to me. I don’t think our relationship needs to go beyond professional boundaries.

Lately, I started being more cold and distant when he talks to me, and he actually confronted me asking if I was angry at him, and immediately assumed that I was “angry at him for no reason” in front of me. This is awkward and exhausting because the office is usually just the 2 of us while the others are out.

I’ve always tried to carry myself with decency. Even though I’m relatively new to the workforce, I believed that as long as I stayed kind and kept my boundaries, I’d stay out of trouble. I didn’t expect that some people can be shameless in ways that aren’t always obvious. I’ve been trying to find excuses to leave the office whenever I can. Luckily I’ll only be here for less than a month more. ",5,1752777893.0,askSingapore,8,0.86,False

1m2foe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1m2foe4/suicide_watch_questions_and_concerns_i_need_help/,Suicide watch questions and concerns. I need help.,"Throwaway account. An SM in my unit attempted suicide about 3 weeks ago, he has been under professional inpatient care since then. He is being discharged tomorrow and my unit wants 24 hour suicide watch on him until he gets re-evaluated about a week later. Random, single, barracks dweller E-5's has been selected to be with him in his barracks room for 24/7 with 12 hour shifts.

This whole situation has been very infuriating to me for various reasons and I wanted to ask you guys to see if I am being selfish or my concerns are valid and this has to be escalated somehow.

-First of all, if he is still ""a risk"", why is he being discharged from the hospital in the begin with?

-Why random E-5's with no skill set/training to handle this type of cases are being given this huge responsibility of ensuring the wellbeing of this SM? In a possible attempt scenario are they going to be able to prevent it? Why they are being put in this situation with possible life-long consequences?

-Looks like our command team deemed suicide watch is necessary for their own reasons. So, why is he not being put in a professional setting to ensure his and other's safety?

-This SM has harmed himself in the recent past, who can guarantee that he is not going to attempt to harm the person who is watching him?

-Isn't this whole arrangement poorly thought, and dangerous for both the SM in question and the person on shift?

-Is it a good idea to have a person who is suicide risk and an untrained junior NCO in a barracks room together for 12 hours at a time?

Since I first heard about this couple hours ago, I can not stop thinking about it, I wanted get this out of my chest and hear your thoughts. I would very much appreciate any guidance you can offer. I am lost in the sauce here.

I will just have a cup of black coffee and a cigarette please. Thanks.

1m2fo7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m2fo7i/i_run_a_radio_station_in_nowhere_oklahoma/,"I run a radio station in Nowhere, Oklahoma","Note: I would love some feedback for the story so please feel free to let me know if anything needs tweaked! I have been working on this for a little bit now but still new to writing!


“You’re listening to… 77.4 MOCR home to old school and new comers. Get your coffee and paper and listen to the jams after the ads!” This is my script I have to read every hour, on the hour. It was an entry level job fresh out of college for broadcasting with a pretty great rate and whatever hours I wanted. Literally a dream job for a newcomer like me. There are a few problems with the job so far. 

First off, it is in the middle of nowhere. It’s literally right in the middle of Nowhere, Oklahoma. It’s a dinky little town not even marked on most maps. There were also no available places to rent or stay in Nowhere or anywhere near, so the radio station has a room and kitchen situated for me. I’ve also never met my boss. They do come to the studio on occasion, but I never see them here. There will occasionally be new notes for upcoming broadcasts in the booth, some snacks and food restocked in the fridge, just small things. I’ve talked over email with him, or her I’m not entirely sure, but never heard their voice. Aside from their phantom appearances, I am pretty sure I’m the only one who is actually here in the studio. 

The booth is hot and stuffy, no air flow or ventilation through there. With the incandescent lights and early 2000’s computers powering the boards, the room constricts the longer you’re in there. The stale air limits each inhale and each exhale adds to the thick air inside. It isn’t insufferable but it’s close. Every ten or so minutes, I have my script that I read. It can vary from news around town, such as “Cat that has been sitting on the side of the road for 4 days has finally decided to cross the road” or “Jeanine from the post office has licked her 8,000th envelope this afternoon.” The real news everyone has been dying for. It can be ad reads for local businesses, one of the six in the 150 mile radius from the station. 

After I read my script, I play the ads and music. The only bad part about it is that I don’t actually hear anything in the booth. I just sit in a booth with air like molasses in actual radio silence for what feels like eternity until it’s my turn to read my lines again. There’s some times that I will play my own music to make the time pass by. I like to imagine the radio station jumps from “Symphony of Destruction” to “Family Tradition” just like my playlist does, but I wouldn’t know. In fact, I can’t even find the actual station anywhere here. Maybe it’s because I’m inside where it’s being broadcast from? Haven’t given much thought to it, but I would hate to hear my own voice reading these stupid scripts. 

There was a new script the other day that read, “This is your 77.4 MOCR station home to what you want to hear, and we want to hear from you! Please dial —— and tell us what you’re thinking. We’re here to listen!” A call in segment? After weeks, maybe months, of being here it has never been more than the usual lines. I can’t even find the station anywhere on the radio so who would even call? There isn’t even a phone in the booth with me. I start up the stairs to the second floor for my shift. With my last breath of fresh air for the next few hours, I step in. 

A fire hydrant of a telephone sat in front of my seat. Old rotary style like it was ripped right from 1968. After reading the script, I sat back and waited. Would it actually ever ring? There’s no way. After a few minutes of impatient waiting, I say, “Well we won’t hold you from your jams you’ve been waiting for, up next is a classic mix we’ve got cued up for you.” I press play and sit back, staring at the phone. It’s one of the only pieces of color in a bleak room, a burning bush in a sea of grey and beige sand. 

The rest of the shift is normal for the most part. The phone feels like a jack in the box, waiting to be sprung. Each moment I had, I stared at its gleaming surface, waiting for the alarm to fill the muggy room. It never did. My anxiety subsided when the fresh air hit my nostrils the minute the clock marked my 4th hour in the room. The next day didn’t relieve any worry, as my first statement on air is just yesterday’s announcement of caller submissions. I say the script again, this time a little less enthusiastic. A tinge of unease weaved into the words that soaked through the microphone. As the last one left my mouth, the room replaced my spiel with silence. Deafening, ringing, unbearable silence. The machines have either gone completely quiet or I have gone deaf. At this point, I’m not sure what I would prefer. The red monolith sat perched on the table top. Completely stationary in its place, it still held the tension of a stand off in Tombstone. Five minutes pass, and not a single note rings through the booth. 

The next day I say screw it. Why waste the time if there aren’t going to be any calls? The script is the same as the previous two days. Obviously my boss is not understanding we broadcast to no one from Nowhere. I read last week’s script instead. After the read, I press play on the music queued and remove the headphones to be replaced with mine. I usually draw funny pictures or something in the meantime and this forsaken phone is taking up my whole drawing board. As soon as I pick up the phone to move it, the vibrations of its ring chill every bone in my body like a wave of horror. I set the phone down and try to catch my breath as it rings again. I reach my trembling hand out and answer the call. 

“He-hello?” I softly whimper into the phone. 
“Read it,” says a gruff man’s voice from the other line. 
“Read- read what?” 
“I have written what you need to say.”
“Who is this?”
“Do not make this mistake again.”

The line disconnects. 

The voice of what I can only assume to be my boss leaves me in a state of confusion and panic. There were more questions I had than answers. Does he listen to every broadcast? Why was this segment so important if no one is going to call? Was this seriously the first real voice I’ve heard in months? I let the rest of the music play out as I read the passage over and over, trying to find some significance to it. By my eighth time reading, the clock lets me now I need to broadcast again. 

No one calls, and for the next three days, it is the same deal. Not a single call comes through after the exact same message is spoken. This was until the seventh day. I thought about not doing it again. Thought about not even going up to the booth, but I was here with my only company being a damned phone. As soon as I finished saying, “We’re here to listen!” the phone rang.

“Hello you’re talking with MOCR!” I said as jauntily as I could. 
“Do you kill snakes in your yard?” The voice inquired, in a hushed yet stern tone. 
“I’m sorry?” I replied. 
“The snakes eat rats and mice as long as it stays warm. What do you prefer, snakes or rats?”
“Well I would say I don’t want either of them.”
“The rats are bred to be rats. They feast on the house and number in the hundreds. The snake was there and will be there, doomed to wonder the yard but never too close to the house.”

The voice is indescribable. It sounds like an amalgamation of hundreds of voices, twisting and moving through one another with each letter spoken. Any time it isn’t talking, a guttural and throaty moan leeks through the phone. My face contorts from unease into confusion. I loosen my posture as I really start to listen to what he says. “What does that mean?” I ask. 
“The beckoning calls of the rats who lived does not mean it is a safe place in the yard. The snakes purpose was to keep the rats from the house. He allowed a rat into the house.”
“I’m not sure where this is-“ it cuts me off. All of the voices fill with anger. 
“He is marked sevenfold to wonder the earth for no man shall lay a finger on him. The snake has bitten him yet he still yearns for the house, but damned to the yard. He is here and will be here until the wormwood oil kills the grass. He will be the last alive for what has been done out of the garden. Let the rat live forever with the snake and see what he can do to the house. He is here and is coming.”

The phone call ends abruptly. The sudden realization of the suffocating room rushes in to my senses. My hands violently shake while the thud from the phone smacking the soft ground reminds me of the petrifying silence I’ve been in since the end of the call. Each breath becomes harder and harder. I run out of the room and downstairs to get water and process what just happened. My mind raced from adrenaline, fear, and curiosity.

I didn’t go in for the next few shifts. I tried to walk around town the next few days, but it didn’t seem like anyone was around anytime I went out. I found one man yesterday who sat on a rock. He had a distinct scar on his head but the rest of him seemed to be a blur. I think I found the only other listener to the radio station. I think I found the caller. I think I found the rat that never died. ",3,1752777753.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

* **Apple Magic Keyboard & a mouse**: Super slim, portable, and I bought a case for both of them. Allows me to use my laptop stand without angling my hands up to use my laptop's keyboard and trackpad. My back is thanking me already. 
   * Side note: Laptop stand, 100% recommended. Still using mine 5 years later. 
* **Samsonite suitcase**: I broke the extendable handle on my IT suitcase a few countries ago and using it was a pain afterwards. My new one seems much more up to the task. 
* **Travel Cutlery set**: Sometimes I get to my destination and theres like 1 fork, 1 spoon. So, I started bringing a little set I bought on Temu for $10, with a case. 
* **Packing cubes**: I bought some one Amazon and some at Daiso in brazil. The Daiso ones were much better, with compression. Makes my suitcase much more organized
* **Passport case with card holders**: Holds my passport, residency cards, a few credit cards, boarding pass, etc. I like to split up my cards in case I get robbed and this is ideal for that.

I struggled for years with chronic fatigue, stomach issues always passed off as IBS, anxiety and depression ect and referred to mental health cycle went on for years. 3 years ago I started to have insomnia after an accident where my ribs locked out and I was unable breathe, it caused a huge stress response I think from the shock of it and my whole body changed over night. My nervous system was in over drive I no longer slept, every substance in my body effected me. E.g stimulants sent my heart racing and severe anxiety and panic attacks. Sedatives would not work at all and I had huge reactions to anything and everything food ect. I quit drinking all together and cut out coffee eventually. Never got any help at the doctors I struggled through my masters not sleeping, with a hyper sensitive nervous system my body reacted to nosies and was constantly tense ect. For two years I kept getting up everyday and working through the most awful feelings, no sleep, bad reactions, I did everything to try help every holistic treatment and herbal supplement every type of therapy and medicine. Nothing really worked but I started to just manage a little. Being told nothing was wrong and told anxiety depression or an old diagnosis of fibromyalgia no matter how much I said it wasn’t I just tried to carry on with life. I look back now and I realise how much I ignored my body through listening to doctors and not myself. At the time though I pushed on and had a lot of stress also in my personal life I had to leave my home suddenly so I moved back home with my mum after I graduated and I booked a trip to Thailand as I was desperate to achieve after such a long battle with my health through my masters. I went to take a course to teach. My insomnia was so bad before I left I’d exhausted every medication at the doctors, I reacted terribly to things like ssris it caused the worst reactions to my mind and body setting off restless legs so bad I wanted to rip my legs off in the night. Every sleep medication did absolutely nothing and the doctors looked at me like I was making it up. I could take a diazepam and a zopiclone and just stare at the roof. I made it to Thailand and the evening I got there off the plane I had food poisoning I spent 3 days in the hotel until I couldn’t keep anything down at all and was meant to be travelling with the group for 3 and a half hours. At 2 am I was in such a bad way sweating and continual vomiting I called the hospital and checked out the hotel and got a taxi to the hospital. They said I had food poisoning and an infection. I left with medication and took the 3 and a half hour trip to the destination of the course. Long story short I flew home in such a bad way I have no idea how I managed the flight home. Over the next 8 months of continual doctors appointment my body deteriorated beyond belief, every doctor appointment I was told nothing wrong and asked if it was in my head and an eating disorder. I developed lumps in my neck (eventually tested as thy3 cancerous cells detected) and severe food intolerances more than I used to have (been gf for years). With no help I paid private for blood tests and tested positive for Hashimotos and hypothyroidism. Missed because drs only tested my TSH. I took all this evidence to my doctors and they ignored it because I paid private. I was rejected by endocrine 3 times I begged to be seen. ENT denied my nodules are anything to do with Hashimotos even though it says Hashimotos is linked with nodule development and it happened at the same time as the symptoms kicked in after returning home post food poisoning and infection. They want to cut half my thyroid out. I had a couple of hospital visits and in hospital my Hashimotos antibodies were tested. It was sent to doctors and they still ignored it and wouldn’t treat me. I paid privately again for a thyroid specialist and got put on NDT. I tried a functional medicine practitioner in a last ditch attempt. I was deteriorating even with her advice over the weeks and I was concerned and telling her what she was doing wasn’t working and I needed to stop. She would reply and say it was okay to do this and that on the plan when I said it wasn’t it was effecting my body. How bad I was she ignored and pushed on when I said what she was advising I couldn’t do and what she was giving me I was throwing up. It felt delusional and even messaging her saying I was in hospital on a drip didn’t seem to be an issue. I cancelled the plan when I left I’d paid over £600 and had another instalment which she tried to take the package was over £1000. I’d had two video calls and awful advice which I believe was negligent now I look back at the information I told her she should have instantly said you need to be in hospital. I was in such a bad way at this point I could no longer keep food or water down. I’d already ended up in the hospital several times and sent home passed off finally when I couldn’t eat or drink at all and was vomiting bile unable to hold my body up I went into hospital. I stayed in 10 days 6 of which I was on a continuous drip, I hadn’t eaten for 2 weeks, I was ignored by endo and gastro I was telling them I was on my thyroid medication and they were putting omeprasol in my in an iv which effects the thyroid medication and the whole 10 days all my symptoms were passed off at a bit of gastritis. I suspected auto immune gastritis caused by the untreated Hashimotos which escalated. I have been tested and not revived any results yet. I had malnutrition and was unable to eat, they told me just to eat anything even if I vomited. Id been having heart palpitations and twitches/spasms and my ecg came back abnormal one night in the hospital the heart flutters and twitches had kicked in and I called the nurse who did the ecg. The next day it was repeated I said I was feeling fine at that point and didn’t think it would be abnormal. It came back normal so they said it was fine and probably just electrolyte imbalance. I’ve had this for a very long time and it’s continued since I’m home and I’m on electrolytes also still. I was on two typed of anti sickness, morphine , paracetamol , buscopan and omeprasol, the moment I ate and drank a minuscule amount they said I was fine to go home.  I left after 10 days and went home from such a horrible experience having no idea what would happen next hoping the medication would start working and I’d start eating and keep it down. Everything I begged for leaving hospital to see endo and gastro and dietician has been a fight and not all come through yet. I switched doctors in hospital and lucky have a really nice female doctor who blew me away when she acknowledged everything and said she would help get to the bottom of it even though she said she didn’t know which I appreciated instead of dismissing me. For the first time I feel like a doctors cares after years of being passed of and 8 months leading to me ending up in hospital being told nothing wrong and in my head. I’m home now it’s been just over two weeks. I read through other Reddit posts and see so many people struggling and I too am finding this a great challenge. My life has changed completely and my perspective too. I’m managing to make bone broths and try soups eating bits of fish and chicken. I have good supplements now and am on the NDT. I’m everything I read about with other people I’m exhausted, still trying to sleep, I’ve finally started to have a few hours which feels like a blessing, my body is strong enough to walk and sit on the grass in the garden this feels like a miracle to me and even though it’s a struggle I can wash my body in the shower. This journey has been so physically and mentally challenging and I have no idea where it’s going.  I’m still waiting to find out if I have auto immune gastritis also as my stomach is still very sore and I’m in pain every day when I eat I can end up on all fours for over an hour breathing until it settles. I’m in pain and mentally I’m trying to do things my body can’t. I’m trying to relax I enjoy breathwork and meditation, I’m trying to find balance and be kind and gentle on myself. I’m letting go of the past and all the things that have caused such great stress in my life and getting in touch with my body again so I feel it and don’t ignore it and believe in myself rather than other people who are not in my body. I’m writing because it feels nice to release and I know so many people are struggling . I have no idea where this will lead I turned 28 a month ago, I’ve fought for years knowing something wasn’t right I battled through a degree and a masters to prove I could do it to the people that thought I had depression and was lazy. I’ve been so hard on my mind and body for years pushing it and ignoring things because I took on the opinions of others that now I’m trying to pave a new way through this. One where I’m kinder and I listen and I don’t let people tell me something doesn’t exists. I hope that if anyone reads this it gives them hope too and that we are not alone. If you have any words of kindness you’d like to share I’d be glad to read. 🙏 I genuinely pray for everyone and their healing on this journey in life and to figure out exactly what we need to work towards balance. The more I take this path the more I find a little faith and connection keeps me going 💖",1,1752777329.0,Hashimotos,0,0.67,False

Midoriya stared at the cracks between the sink and the yellowing bathroom wall, musing over the source of this instability as he prepared for his weekly Sunday ritual. Blades, gauze, bandaids, damp towel...what else? He was already so tired; he had the dearest fortune of being in Kacchan’s way today—or rather, being in his line of sight, even though geographically there was about 50 meters between the two—while trying to find that new cafe with the Silver Age All Might memorabilia that he just had to see. 

He was so close, too. He could almost taste the Red White and Yellow Supreme Shake they promoted on their website. The newly painted doors of the establishment were just out of his reach, so close he could hear the whizz of the coffee machines behind the bar. 

Midoriya sent a silent prayer to whoever was listening that Kacchan was preoccupied, mouth curling in amusement as he listened to what Midoriya could only assume was something cruel Bakugo’s friend with the long neck—Haruto—told him. Midoriya breathed another sigh of relief as he realized the three—there was also the black haired kid with the big hands, Uzume, Izuku’s brain supplied—were walking in opposite direction of him. A rare stroke of luck, it seemed, that Kacchan was too busy with his buddies—Haruto in particular seemed quite close, with the way his hand was reaching towards the Bakugo. The blond’s footsteps were uncharacteristically silent, overshadowed by the giggles of the other two. Corroboration of his good mood, really. A tendril of jealousy creeped around Midoriya’s neck, a noose tightening rhythmically with the stead-fast beating of his heart. It hurt, truly, to see someone else bring his childhood friend such joy when he had to grovel just to see a slight smirk pull at Bakugo’s mouth. 

Midoriya shook his head, letting himself steal on last look as he hurriedly walked toward the cafe. Closer now, he could feel the faint vibrations from the bass, the repetitive beat of the drum reminding him of an artery split open, spilling out blood in cohesion to each pump of a heart.

""Gianna, the funeral was about to start. Wasn't Rodrigo coming yet?""

Gianna Pollard was dressed in white mourning clothes, kneeling in front of her mother's memorial hall. The firelight from the burning joss paper lit up her pale little face.

She looked down at her phone, which was almost out of battery. Rodrigo Salazar's call still wasn't answered.

Mother passed away, Gianna, seven months pregnant, stayed at the mourning hall for seven days, and her husband of three years didn't show up even once.

Rodrigo was really busy with work, and Gianna always understood him.

She sensibly told herself, Rodrigo might be busy with work.

""He might have been busy, but he still came.""

Tear stains were still on Gianna's face. She burned the last bit of joss paper in her hand and struggled to stand up with her heavy body. Her voice was already hoarse and broken as she said, ""Let's start the funeral.""

Aunt Taniya Hooper next to her said sarcastically, ""Gianna, how busy could Mr. Salazar be? He didn't show up for seven days. He really didn't care about your mom at all.""

My cousin Madilyn Pollard snorted, ""Mom, you got it wrong. Mr. Salazar didn't disrespect Auntie, he just didn't care about our cousin. Oh, and her baby too.""

A few people's mocking voices sounded especially harsh. Gianna's chest ached with bitterness, but she still told herself, Rodrigo has always been a good husband since we got married. He wouldn't stay away on purpose. He must've just been caught up with work.

She had just convinced herself, but reality slapped her hard.

Madilyn looked at her phone and shouted, ""Isn't this Mr. Salazar? Mr. Salazar is even on the trending topic.""

Madilyn deliberately handed her phone to Gianna.

Gianna looked down at her phone. It was a trending topic video. The trending topic was from this morning, and the video was from last night.

Title: the Salazar Group Mr. Salazar booked the whole place for Paisley Moyer's birthday because she was his true love.

In the video, fireworks lit up the night sky. The man sat on a chair nearby, looking elegant and confident. His deep eyes quietly watched the girl next to him. The girl pointed at the fireworks, and her smile seemed even brighter than the fireworks.

The fireworks were dazzling, but Gianna only had her eyes on the man's back.

She knew right away—the man in the video was her husband, Rodrigo.

So he was with another woman setting off fireworks for her birthday last night?

Gianna's mind went blank for a while, and her body was so stiff she couldn't move.

The sound of fireworks kept going along with Madilyn's mocking voice, ""Cousin, didn't you say your husband was busy? He sure was busy—busy renting out a whole place to celebrate some other woman's birthday.""

Gianna clenched her fists, and all she could think about was Rodrigo renting out the whole place and setting off fireworks for another woman's birthday.

She thought he was busy.

Even when something as big as her mom passing away happened, she handled it all by herself and didn't dare to bother him much.

Seven days, he didn't have time to answer a single call from her, didn't have time to come burn incense for her mom, but somehow had time to rent out a whole place and set off fireworks for another woman's birthday.

How funny that was.

The woman in the video was Rodrigo's first love, the woman Rodrigo loved deeply.

And she was just the woman Leandro Salazar wanted Rodrigo to marry and bring home as his wife, hoping to repay her father for saving his life and to give her someone to rely on forever.

These three years, Gianna knew he didn't love her, so she never dared to trouble Rodrigo with her own stuff, and didn't dare to ask for anything.

Rodrigo was an indifferent guy who didn't understand romance. He didn't celebrate any holidays, and all he had in life was work.

It wasn't until today that she realized Rodrigo didn't not understand romance, he just didn't want to be romantic with her.

Rodrigo made Gianna the biggest joke with a brilliant, grand fireworks show.

Gianna clenched her teeth and tried hard to push down the pain inside. She looked away from her phone. She wanted to make herself look less ridiculous.

Her mother's funeral still needed her to take care of things, she had to hold on.

Gianna forced herself to bend down, picked up her mom's memorial tablet, and walked out, ignoring those people's mocking looks.

Gianna still remembered her mom wanted to see Rodrigo one more time before she died.

At that time she also called Rodrigo a lot, he didn't pick up, maybe he was with Paisley then too.

Her mom hoped she could be happy with Rodrigo forever.

But maybe I couldn't do it.

After taking care of everything by herself and after all the relatives and friends finished eating and left, Gianna sat alone on a chair in the dining room.

Rodrigo showed up late. He wore a black shirt, and there wasn't much expression on his handsome face. His eyes landed on Gianna. Seeing the scene, there was actually a bit of apology on his usually emotionless face.

Gianna held her belly and looked up at him, and that suppressed grievance rushed out all at once.

Gianna took a deep breath and swallowed her grievance hard, her face showing no emotion, ""Just finished?""

Rodrigo didn't notice the fragility in her voice.

""There was a meeting during the day.""

""What about last night? Did you have a good time on your birthday?""

Rodrigo frowned, and before he could say anything, a woman in a red dress, with Rodrigo's jacket over her shoulders, walked in behind him.

Gianna's face got even darker.

""Gianna, sorry, Rodrigo was with me last night. My mom got sick a few days ago, and Rodrigo was worried I'd have a hard time alone, so he helped me take care of her. That's why he didn't check your messages. It's all my fault, I shouldn't have bothered Rodrigo.""

Gianna listened to what Paisley said, and a wave of bitterness surged up in her heart.

""Was your mother very sick?""

""Not serious, just a little cold, had a bit of a fever, but it was almost better now.""

Gianna felt like someone had punched her hard in the chest. She tried hard to control her emotions, but her red eyes and trembling lips still gave her away.

Rodrigo frowned even more. He knew that when Gianna's mom passed away, he was in a meeting. When the meeting ended and he planned to come over, something happened with Paisley again. With so much going on, he just forgot about Gianna's situation.

No matter what, he was sorry.

Rodrigo wanted to go light some incense for Gianna's mom first, but Gianna reached out to stop him, ""No need, her mom is more important, you go be with her and her mom.""

Rodrigo paused.

Gianna didn't want to stay here anymore, so she stood up and was about to leave.

She didn't cry, Gianna didn't let herself shed tears for people who weren't worth it.

Rodrigo looked at Gianna, who was already seven months along and having trouble walking, and suddenly felt a bit sorry for her.

Paisley just called him in a panic when her mom got sick, crying her eyes out, while when Gianna's mom passed away, she got through it all by herself.

""Where are you going? Don't run around when you're pregnant."" Rodrigo wanted to call out to Gianna.

Gianna gave a wry smile.

So he actually knew she was pregnant.

He left his pregnant wife behind and went to take care of someone else's mother, so it showed he didn't care about her or the baby at all.

Kids who weren't wanted or cared about when they were born didn't end up happy.

Gianna looked down at her stomach. In pain, it seemed like she made some kind of decision. She walked faster and faster and went straight into the elevator.

Rodrigo felt a tightness in his chest and hurried after her. Paisley grabbed him, ""Rodrigo, Gianna's mom just passed away and she's really upset. Maybe let her calm down by herself.""

Rodrigo frowned at Paisley and pushed her hand away. His voice was cold, ""She's in a bad mood right now and could get into trouble. You should go back by yourself.""

Rodrigo went out and Gianna was already gone.

Looking at the busy street, Rodrigo took out his phone and made a call, ""Track Gianna's phone and find her right now.""

There was a bit of unease on Rodrigo's handsome face.

One hour later.

The assistant called Rodrigo, ""Sir, madam was at the hospital.""

""What did she go to the hospital for?""

""Ab...abortion, and, the wife had a lawyer draft a divorce agreement, the wife already signed it.""

There was a ""buzz"" in my ear.

Rodrigo's deep eyes were full of disbelief.

Chapter 2 Mommy, Linda Saw Daddy

Five years later.

Freyton Auction House.

In the spacious hall, celebrities gathered.

At the auction, the auctioneer wore a white qipao. Her black hair was tied up, and a thin veil covered her face, so you couldn't see what she looked like, but every move she made was amazingly beautiful.

She confidently and smoothly introduced the auction items on the display table, and people in the audience rushed to bid.

A pair of clear eyes swept over the audience, holding the gavel, in control of everything.

On the second floor, Rodrigo sat there, tilted his head and glanced over, ""The person Grandpa insisted on seeing is her?""

The assistant next to him handed over the documents, ""Yeah, her name's Gina. She started here as an auctioneer five years ago. At her first auction, she sold an ancient landscape painting with a starting price of one million for a sky-high sixty million. That's sixty times the original price. She became famous with just one sale.""

Rodrigo squinted his eyes, ""She always showed up with a veil?""

The assistant thought for a moment and said, ""Yeah, I heard someone once offered her ten million to take off her veil, but she turned them all down. People said she was so ugly that she didn't want to take it off.""

Rodrigo put out his cigarette and watched quietly, ""Nice eyes.""

With such beautiful eyes, how could she have been shockingly ugly.

And those eyes looked like a person.

Who did it look like?

Like Gianna.

That woman from five years ago, who left a divorce agreement, got rid of his baby without saying a word, and left—no one's been able to find her since.

""Bring her to see me.""

Rodrigo stood up, took a couple of steps, and he stopped.

""It's been five years, and there's still no sign of Gianna?""

The assistant was terrified.

They all said people couldn't just vanish into thin air.

But his wife really just disappeared from the face of the earth. It's been five years, and there wasn't a single clue.

Rodrigo had a headache, ""Keep looking.""

That woman was ruthless. She got divorced, aborted his baby, and blocked and deleted all his contact info.

I guess nobody knew that the president of the Salazar Group was actually the one who got dumped by a divorce agreement, and nobody knew he had been looking for the woman who left him for five years.

Rodrigo had to find her. He wanted to ask her what exactly he had done that was so unforgivable that made her act like this.

Rodrigo left.

Assistant Kade Navarro stood there breaking out in a cold sweat. He had looked everywhere he should, but there was no news at all.

Couldn't find the person for five years, so keeping on looking was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Kade muttered to himself miserably, ""Ma'am, where on earth are you.""

An auction ended, Gina gave a graceful little bow and turned to leave.

Five years ago, Gianna came to Freyton and started working at an auction house. She changed her name to Gina. To avoid unnecessary trouble, she always wore a veil at the auction house.

Came to the office.

A soft, squishy little pink dumpling ran over with its short little legs, opened its chubby hands, hugged Gianna's leg, and called out in a crisp voice, ""Mommy.""

Gianna took off her veil and showed a delicate, beautiful little face. She bent down and picked up her daughter, kissed her on her fair face, and said, ""Has Linda been waiting long? Where are your brothers?""

Little Pink Dumpling's tiny hands were all bunched up, lifted her little head, ""Hmph, the big brothers went out to play.""

""Weren't they bringing Linda?""

""They said if we went to play boys' games, we couldn't bring Linda.""

Gianna, ""...""

These two guys just wanted to ditch Linda, just say it.

Back then, Gianna was so discouraged that she wanted to get rid of the baby, but when she actually saw the operating room, she couldn't go through with it and gave up in the end.

Two months after she came to Freyton, she had three babies, two boys and a girl.

The oldest was called Elliot Pollard, the second was called Jacob Pollard, and the third was called Belinda Pollard.

Elliot was sensible, Jacob was naughty, Belinda was the cutest.

Gianna looked at the little baby in her arms and felt glad about the decision she made back then.

""By the way, Mommy, guess who Linda and the boys saw today.""

""Who is it?""

""Was a bad daddy.""

Linda spoke loudly, but Gianna didn't catch it.

""Who did Linda say she saw?""

""Linda and her brothers saw the bad daddy, the one who shows up on TV, called... called... Rodrigo, the bad daddy, the really mean one.""

Linda was talking and raised her little hand to gesture to Gianna.

Gianna listened to what Linda said, and her heart skipped a beat.

These past few years, she rarely heard the name Rodrigo.

For a while, Gianna forgot this person even existed.

But at that moment, when his name came out of Linda's mouth, all the memories came rushing back, and Gianna still felt a pang in her chest.

But how did Rodrigo end up here?

Her kids only knew their dad was called Rodrigo, saw him a few times on TV, probably got it wrong.

""Linda got it wrong, he wasn't coming here.""

""But...""

Knock knock—

Two knocks on the door interrupted Linda.

""Who?""

""Gina, are you busy? The manager asked you to go over right away. An important guest asked for you by name. The manager told you to hurry up.""

Honored guest?

They had plenty of VIPs at their auction house, but there really weren't many who could make the manager this nervous.

Gianna was actually kind of curious how important the guest was.

""Not busy, I'll be right over.""

""But Linda really saw the bad daddy."" Linda frowned and spoke softly. Gianna looked at her. Linda blinked her big watery eyes and asked a little sadly, ""Is mommy going to work again?""

Gianna put Linda on the sofa and said apologetically, ""Linda, baby, wait a little longer. Mommy will be back soon, okay?""

Although I really wanted mommy to stay with me, I couldn't let her work be delayed.

Linda was very well-behaved.

""Okay, Linda waited for mommy.""

Gianna kissed her daughter on the cheek again and gave her some bread, ""Linda, have some bread. Later, Mommy will take you and your brothers out for a big meal, okay?""

""Okay.""

Gianna gave a gentle smile, put on her veil, and walked out.

Linda held the bread in both hands and ran to the door, poking her head out to quietly check outside.

Mommy left again, so bored.

Linda put down the bread, tapped her smartwatch, and asked in a childish voice, ""Brothers, where are you? Linda came to find you.""

Soon Linda got a reply, a location pin plus, ""In the underground parking lot.""

In the underground parking lot, two little kids stood in front of a black Maybach.

Elliot hugged his little arms and looked at Jacob with a complicated expression, ""Are you sure this car was scumbag daddy's?""

Jacob worked hard painting on the car with a paintbrush.

It was all done.

""Couldn't be wrong, I saw him get out of this car.""

Elliot looked at the big messy words on the car and quietly read, ""A jerk who ditched his wife and kid.""

Chapter 3 Reunion

Elliot patted his head and looked at Jacob speechlessly, ""Mom always told you to read more and play less on the computer, but you secretly played on the computer again, didn't you? You couldn't write a single one of the seven characters, and you got two of them wrong.""

""Bro, don't worry about these details."" Jacob chuckled, and after finishing, he drew a really abstract pig next to it.

""Hmph, dog dad.""

Let everyone know you were a total jerk.

These years they hadn't met Dog Dad, but they'd heard his name and seen him on TV happily going to events with other women.

So when they saw Rodrigo here for the first time, they recognized him right away, no doubt about it.

Gianna didn't want to talk to the kids about anything about Rodrigo, so most things were told to them by Gianna's best friend Joselyn Cunningham when they kept asking her.

So the kids knew why mommy brought them to live here alone, because bad daddy did things that hurt mommy, he didn't deserve to be mommy's husband, and he didn't deserve to be their daddy.

""Big brother, second brother, what were you doing?"" Linda ran over.

""Shh."" Jacob immediately covered Linda's mouth. ""Linda, keep it down, we're doing something bad.""

Linda immediately covered her mouth and nodded, making sure she wouldn't make a sound. Then Linda saw the words written on the car with colored markers, ""Second brother, you wrote the wrong word.""

Jacob awkwardly waved his little hand, ""...Don't mind those details.""

Elliot took Linda's hand and asked her, ""Linda, is mommy still not off work yet?""

""Mommy was called to the office by the manager uncle.""

At that moment, in the manager's office.

When Gianna went in, the manager looked at her and immediately waved her over, introducing her: ""Gina, come here, this is Mrs. Salazar. Mrs. Salazar, this is the auctioneer Gina you were looking for.""

Mrs. Salazar?

Gianna looked up, glanced over, and frowned a little.

It was actually her!

Paisley!

The woman Rodrigo loved deeply back then.

Mrs. Salazar? Yeah, that's right. Rodrigo loved her, she divorced him, so of course he couldn't wait to marry Paisley.

I really didn't expect that, back then she helped Rodrigo and her get together, came to Freyton alone, and actually ran into her again in Freyton.

Gianna felt a tightness in her chest, and her face turned a bit colder.

Paisley was all dressed up, put down her coffee, glanced at Gianna with the veil, and there seemed to be some disdain in her eyes.

Chief auctioneer?

Could you appraise antiques?

She once got famous with a single hit. People online talked her up like she was some kind of legend, and I thought she was really something. But in the end, she didn't even dare show her real face.

I didn't get why Leandro had to see her.

Paisley snorted, ""So you're Gina. I heard you're not just an auctioneer, you can also appraise antiques? We wanted to hire you for a few days, come back to Newbarrow with us to the Salazar family to look at some antiques. Name your price.""

Paisley was confident that no one could say no to ""name your price,"" and besides, the Salazar family's name was something everyone had heard of, so of course no one would dare refuse.

She picked up her coffee and took a sip, not in a hurry, waiting for Gianna to come over and flatter her.

A chill ran through Gianna's heart.

She could appraise antiques.

But no matter what, they just couldn't get her to come.

Gianna left back then because she didn't want to see them again, so there's no way she would've agreed to go back to Newbarrow with her.

""Sorry, my job was an auctioneer. If you wanted to appraise antiques, you could find someone else. I couldn't do it. Manager, I had something else to do, so I left first.""

Gianna said that and was about to leave.

Paisley was stunned.

She actually said no.

""Wait, do you know who I am? You better think it over before you answer.""

""I knew very well, I refused.""

""What's your attitude? I paid you to come back, what made you unwilling?""

Paisley stood up and grabbed Gianna.

To please Leandro, Paisley just had to bring someone back.

Gianna frowned, lowered her eyes, and looked at the hand Paisley was gripping tightly.

At that moment, her pupils shrank.

Paisley wore a full green jade bracelet on her wrist. The color was even and the water was great. It was top-quality jade, worth over a hundred million. And she recognized it at a glance—this jade bracelet was her family's heirloom.

It was given to her by her mom. Back then, her mom told her to take good care of this bracelet, saying it might be really useful for her someday. But she left in a hurry that year, so the bracelet was still with the Salazar family, and now it actually ended up with Paisley.

Did Rodrigo give it to her?

He wanted to give it to Paisley, but why did he use her stuff as a gift?

Gianna grabbed Paisley's hand with a backhand grip, ""Is this jade bracelet yours?""

Paisley gave Gianna an annoyed look, ""Of course it's mine, my husband gave it to me. If it's not mine, is it yours?""

Sure enough, it was Rodrigo who gave it to her.

My chest hurt so bad. Rodrigo clearly knew this was hers, but he still gave it to Paisley!

What kind of total jerk gives his ex-wife's family heirloom to his current wife?

Wasn't he grossed out?

""Let go.""

Just as I was thinking, a cold and forceful voice sounded.

Gianna looked up. The man had shown up at the door without her noticing. Her eyes suddenly met his deep, dark ones.

The man was tall and had a straight posture. His features were handsome. Just by standing there, the strong sense of pressure built up from years of power was hard to hide.

Gianna's fingers tightened.

Rodrigo!

It was actually Rodrigo.

Linda said seeing Rodrigo wasn't a mistake!

Gianna should've thought that since these two loved each other so much, if Paisley showed up, Rodrigo would probably be there too.

Gianna had been gone for five years and hadn't thought she'd see Rodrigo again.

She didn't want to see him again, because she was scared.

She had three kids. If Rodrigo found out, he would definitely take the kids away.

Because big families like the Salazar family wouldn't have allowed their bloodline to be left out there.

And these three kids had already become Gianna's whole life, Gianna didn't allow even the slightest chance of being separated from them.

This was also the reason why Gianna had worn a veil and been extra careful all these years.

Gianna clenched her palm, and the man's eyes fell on her, like he wanted to see her face through that thin veil.

Gianna's heart kept beating faster.

Paisley shook off Gianna's hand and totally changed her face. ""Rodrigo, I told this Gina, but Gina just wouldn't go back with us. She seemed to really look down on us.""

Looked down on the Salazar family.

Go ahead and die, her.

Paisley lifted her head.

Rodrigo stared at Gianna, ""Name your price.""",2,1752777139.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1m2fe96,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m2fe96/i_woke_up_in_someone_elses_memories/,I Woke Up in Someone Else’s Memories,"I’ve always been an ordinary person. Discreet, predictable. I work as an archivist at the New York City Municipal Records Department. It’s not glamorous, but it gives me a stable routine. My days started early, with the same subway commute, the same corner coffee, the same yellowed papers piled on my desk. I used to find comfort in that. Nobody depended on me. I didn’t depend on anyone. Silence was easier than any attempt at a social life.

But then, the forgetfulness began. Small things, at first. I’d come home from work and find the TV on channels I never watch. A book on neurology appeared on my bookshelf, with my name written on the back cover. I didn’t remember buying it. I thought it was just fatigue. But the real discomfort came when I noticed that some messages on my phone didn’t make sense. Incomplete conversations with unsaved numbers, with replies like, “You promised you wouldn’t go back there.” And the strangest part: the message was archived as sent by me.

I tried to ignore it. I deleted the conversation and moved on with my life. But days later, I found something harder to discard. I was reorganizing my shelves, as I do every weekend. Among old reports and reference documents, there was a black-covered notebook I didn’t recognize. When I opened it, a chill ran down my spine. The handwriting was mine. The sentence structure, too. But I had no idea when or why I had written it.

The first pages were full of names. Rachel L., Peter W., Emily S. — all accompanied by dates, locations, and short observations. There were even small hand-drawn maps, some looking like subway layouts or familiar Manhattan streets. But the most disturbing thing wasn't the content. It was the feeling that I had seen all of it before, in some forgotten dream or erased memory.

I kept reading. One note said: ""Check missing persons records in Brooklyn between 1999 and 2003."" Another, right below it, in bold: ""**DO NOT GO BACK TO THAT BUILDING. NOT AGAIN.**""

I remember stopping there, closing the notebook, and staring at my own signature at the bottom of the page. It was written with the same pen I use every day at work. The date was recent. This couldn’t be right.

For a moment, I thought maybe someone was playing a trick on me. A coworker, perhaps. But the idea dissipated when, flipping through the rest of the notebook, I found references that were too intimate. Details from my childhood, the name of my elementary school, my fear of flying. Things I had never told anyone. And yet, there they were, written with precision — and with a familiarity that frightened me.

In the following days, I started noticing other things. The bathroom mirror seemed a little smaller than I remembered. The doorknob in my bedroom, which had always been brass, was now brushed steel. Small details that anyone would call distractions. But I knew what was mine. And the world around me was silently changing.

Still, I kept going to work. I kept pretending everything was fine. But every night, the notebook waited for me on the table. And with each new page I read, I felt something inside me drifting further away. As if I were living a life that wasn't exactly mine. As if my memories were being replaced by others. Memories of someone who had walked the same places, talked to the same people… but made different decisions.

Deep down, I think a part of me already knew: I had woken up inside someone else's story. And mine was disappearing without a trace.

It wasn’t long before the dreams began. At first, they were just loose images. Endless corridors, half-open doors, names whispered in the dark. But then came the faces. And the most frequent was hers. Rachel. It was always the same scene: a damp concrete staircase, muffled sounds from upstairs, and her holding my hand, telling me I needed to remember. Her voice had a calm tone, like someone repeating a forgotten truth. And the most disturbing thing was that, in the dreams, I believed I knew every word, every gesture, every scent of that scene.

When I woke up, I could still feel the texture of the rough wall I’d leaned against in the dreams. The smell of mold lingered in my nose for minutes. Sometimes, the alarm clock would ring and I’d already be sitting in bed, looking at my hands as if they belonged to someone else. And the notebook… it was still there. Every time I opened it, I found more names. Some crossed out, others circled. Some sounded vaguely familiar, like people I might have seen on the subway or in a line. Others seemed completely made up.

But one name in particular caught my attention. Rachel L. It was the same as in the dream. The same last initial. Next to the name, there was a date: “Missing in 2003.” That bothered me. I turned on my computer, accessed the city's public archives, and started searching. I didn’t expect to find anything, but there it was. Rachel Langdon. Twenty-four years old. Missing person report filed in October 2003. Last seen leaving a building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. No body found. No conclusive leads. Case closed due to lack of evidence.

I stared at the screen for long minutes. This couldn’t be a coincidence. The Rachel from the dream had the same features as the photo in the report. Dark hair, deep-set eyes, a small mole above her upper lip. I had never seen that woman before — at least, not while awake. And yet, I felt like I knew every detail of her face. It felt like I had lived something that had been erased from me. Or worse, something that should never have been lived.

In the days that followed, the dreams intensified. They were no longer static. Now there was movement, fear, panic. I ran with Rachel through empty corridors, climbed stairs with her screaming behind me, tried to lock doors that never seemed to close. And whenever I reached her, she said the same thing: “You promised. Don’t go back there.”

I couldn’t keep it to myself. I showed the notebook to a coworker, Jason, someone I’d always trusted. He flipped through a few pages, laughed nervously, and said I must be writing a mystery novel. I tried to explain that I didn’t remember writing any of those entries, but the more I insisted, the more he backed away. Until he put the notebook down on my desk and said, more seriously, “Maybe you should get some help, Mike.”

But how do you explain something like this? How do you convince someone that you wake up with memories that aren’t yours, that you know people you’ve never seen, that you dream of places you’ve never been but that really exist? How do you explain that you feel your life slipping through your fingers, being replaced by another that is more real, more vivid, but doesn't belong to you?

That’s when I found the second name. Peter W. In the notebook, there was a note beside it: “Community gardens, Astoria — 1998.” I rummaged through old missing person records in Queens and there it was: Peter Whitmore, disappeared in June 1998. Case closed. No connection to Rachel. No reason for the two to be on the same list. None — except for the fact that both now appeared in my memories.

One of the following nights, I dreamed I was talking to Peter on a park bench. He was holding a crumpled pack of cards and said the city wasn’t the same anymore. I replied, in my dreams, that I also felt out of place. I woke up crying, his name written on my hand, the pen still on my nightstand. I didn’t remember doing that. But there it was, legible, like a mark left by another me.

By this point, I couldn’t trust my own thoughts. It was as if my mind was split, one part trying to continue life as before and the other… well, the other trying to solve a puzzle for which I only had half the pieces. The names, the dates, the dreams, the real evidence — everything connected subtly, but constantly. Like a trail someone had left for me.

And there was something else. A growing feeling that these memories weren’t just borrowed. They were replacing mine. When I tried hard to remember my last girlfriend, all that came to mind was Rachel. When I tried to remember my mother’s face, for an instant, I thought it was the dark-haired woman from the dreams. The confusion was so deep that I started to doubt everything.

After weeks of confusion, I began to seriously distrust my own mind. I avoided eye contact with colleagues, spent my days at work re-reading old files, trying to find some name, some date, some clue that would tell me where those memories came from. But no answer was enough, because every new discovery brought more questions. I wasn’t just having strange memories — I was being transformed by them.

I decided to take a more direct approach. I bought a simple camera, one that records continuously for hours. I positioned it next to my bed and started filming myself sleeping. For the first two days, I didn’t notice anything beyond normal movements — turning over, getting up to drink water. But on the third night, something happened.

The video shows exactly 3:12 AM. I sit up in bed, fully awake, but with a distant look. I get up, go to my desk, open the notebook, and start writing frantically. It’s not just the speed that’s startling. It’s the posture. The way my body moves, rigid, disconnected. As if I were being manipulated by someone, or something. The writing also disturbed me. Reviewing the video frame by frame, I realized I wasn’t writing in English. Or in any language I knew. The letters had curved shapes, circular symbols between the words, like glyphs or some forgotten tongue.

I woke up the next morning with the notebook closed in its usual position. When I opened it, the page was covered in notes I didn’t recognize. I didn’t even remember getting up during the night. Seeing that with my own eyes knocked me off my feet. I wasn't just dreaming. I was acting within something larger than my conscious mind allowed me to remember.

I tried to take the video to an acquaintance who works with security systems. I said I wanted to understand if there was any kind of magnetic interference or image manipulation. He analyzed the file seriously, but ended up saying something that paralyzed me: “You’re not alone in that room.”

I asked him to explain. He fast-forwarded the video to the part where I was writing, and paused on a frozen frame. In the background, in the mirror’s reflection, there was a silhouette — dark, thin, standing behind me. It wasn’t there when the video was recorded. I swear. Reviewing the footage, it’s impossible to notice the presence with the naked eye. But the reflection was there. Something — or someone — was watching me as I wrote words I didn’t understand, with handwriting that didn’t seem like mine.

From that day on, the tension became constant. The notebook appeared in different places in the house. Sometimes, on top of the refrigerator. Other times, under the bed. One morning, I found the notebook inside my clothes closet, completely wet. The cover was still dripping. But there were no signs of a leak. No burst pipes, no spilled glass. And even soaked, the pages remained legible. The words didn’t dissolve. It made no sense.

My coworkers started commenting. They said I was different. Jason, the same one who doubted me at first, asked if I was taking any new medication. He said my voice was deeper, and that sometimes, when I spoke, I seemed to have a British accent. I’ve never lived outside the United States.

One day, in the elevator, an employee from the fifth floor greeted me as if we were old friends. “Michael? Long time no see. Did you go back to the archives?” I smiled politely, but I had never seen that woman in my life. Or at least I thought I hadn’t. She seemed to know me too well. And there was something in her gaze — a brief moment of hesitation, as if she, too, was confused. As if she was seeing someone who shouldn't be there.

I went home early that day. I locked all the doors. I covered the mirrors. I sat in front of the notebook and stared at it for hours, as if it were a silent enemy. My head throbbed. There were too many questions and no answers. Then, for the first time, I tried to write something in the notebook consciously. I picked up a pen and wrote on the last blank page:

“Who is doing this to me?”

I waited. Nothing happened. I closed the notebook and went to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up with my heart pounding. The notebook was on my chest. The page where I had written was there, but below my question, a new line had been added.

“You already know the answer.”

The handwriting was identical to mine, but I swear it wasn’t me. I would have remembered. And the answer was the kind of thing no one would say to themselves… unless they were trying to hide the truth.

I started questioning everything. My childhood memories came with interruptions. I remembered riding my bike on the street where I grew up, but I couldn’t remember my father’s face. I remembered school lunches, but I couldn’t visualize any classmates. When I forced my mind, the images blurred — and, sometimes, the face that appeared instead was Rachel’s.

That feeling of living a borrowed life only increased. And the fear no longer came from external things, but from myself. What else was I capable of doing while asleep? What else had been written by my hands and hidden from my consciousness? And more than that: who was the real Michael? By this point, I no longer knew if I was losing my sanity or if I was waking up to an even more horrifying reality.

The boundaries between the real and the impossible began to disappear silently, almost politely. First, it was the building on my street corner. An old red townhouse with wooden windows that I passed every day on my way to the subway. One morning, it simply wasn't there anymore. In its place was a glass commercial building, with a mirrored facade and a coffee shop on the ground floor. The sidewalk still had the same crack in the concrete, and the pole with the cat adoption poster was intact. But the building… it was different.

I asked an older woman passing by if she remembered the old house. She looked at me as if I were crazy. “That tower’s been here since the 90s,” she said, and kept walking. That shook me. I went home, looked for old photos, Google Maps records, anything to confirm my memory. But in all the images… the glass building had always been there.

In the following days, other things started to change. Small, but noticeable. My kitchen seemed more spacious than I remembered. The bathroom wallpaper was light blue — I was sure it was beige. My bank account showed a purchase transaction at a bookstore in Boston. I had never been to Boston. But the receipt was there, with my full name and signature. Even my bank manager confirmed it personally. “You even mentioned the traffic on your way back,” he said. I laughed, trying to seem calm. But inside, I felt like I was slowly being deleted and rewritten.

On the subway, I noticed that the line map had changed. There were stations I’d never heard of. Some I’d known since childhood simply weren’t there anymore. I asked a security guard, and he just told me the line had always been that way. But I knew it wasn’t true. I could even see the old station name, erased, like a shadow under the new paint. As if the city was trying to hide something from me.

My friends also started acting strangely. Jason, for example, began avoiding me. Before, he used to invite me to lunch, exchange texts, laugh at silly jokes. Now, he barely responded to me. One day, I walked into his office at work and saw him talking to another colleague. When they noticed me, they fell silent. Jason just said, “I thought you’d already left.”

“Left for where?” I asked. But he didn’t answer.

I went back to my desk and realized my work folder had been emptied. All the files I’d been researching about disappearances — names, dates, old reports — were out of the system. As if they had never existed. I started looking for Rachel again, but her file was gone. I tried using keywords, approximate dates, even names of relatives. Nothing. It was as if someone was erasing the tracks as I followed them.

It was that same afternoon that I found the first photograph. It was among the loose pages of my notebook. An analog image, faded, with worn edges. I was in it, next to three people. Two women and one man. We were sitting in a park, with coffee cups in our hands. I was smiling. So were the others. But I didn’t recognize any of them. Neither the place. Nor the clothes I was wearing. On the back of the photo, in cursive handwriting, was written:

“September 2001 — after the funeral.”

Whose funeral? Who were those people?

I tried to scan the photo, look for signs of digital manipulation, but the image was authentic. And the strangest thing: my features were identical, but with one detail — the scar on my left eyebrow. I don’t have a scar. At least, I didn’t. The next morning, looking in the mirror, it was there. Thin, discreet, but undeniably real. I ran my finger over the mark, trying to understand. It was as if the me in the photograph was slowly replacing the me I knew.

The feeling of depersonalization intensified. I began to doubt what I knew. I tried to remember the name of my second-grade teacher, but only Rachel’s face came to mind. I tried to remember the name of the school… and nothing. I concentrated with all my might, trying to pull from memory, but all that emerged was the smell of mold in the dreams, the concrete stairs, the muffled sound of screams from the other floor.

I started filming myself all the time. Recordings on the subway, at work, at home. But with each video I watched, something was wrong. A light that flickered at a strange rhythm. A reflection that didn’t seem to follow my movement. In one of the videos, as I slept, the camera recorded an inverted image for a few seconds — as if the world had turned upside down. Then it returned to normal, but that night I dreamed I was endlessly falling down a dark well, with voices calling my name. Several names. None of them were Michael.

The following week, I received a letter. No sender. No stamp. Just my name, written in blue ink, in letters that looked almost childish. Inside, there was a single sheet, with one sentence:

“What you remember isn’t what happened. But what happened isn’t what exists either.”

I stared at that sentence as if it were an enigma. But at the same time… it made sense. I felt, deep in my chest, that all versions of my life were wrong. That none of this was fixed. That maybe I had never come from anywhere to begin with. And that this body, this city, these people… were just a temporary outline of what I really was.

That’s when I understood the most frightening thing: maybe there was no going back. Maybe I never came from anywhere to begin with.

I dreamed I was screaming. Not from pain, but from despair. I was screaming words I didn’t understand, in a language that felt like mine, but wasn’t. The sound reverberated between padded walls, and there was too much white light. In the dream, I was wearing hospital clothes, and someone behind the glass was writing everything down in a notebook identical to mine. I woke up with trembling hands and a raw throat, as if I had spent the whole night begging to leave a place I couldn’t name. But the strangest part… was that the dream seemed more real than my waking life.

I spent the entire day with a persistent feeling that something had changed again. The bathroom mirror now reflected my face with a permanent shadow under my eyes, even with good lighting. When I reviewed my notes in the notebook, I noticed that several pages had been rearranged. Sequences that were once in chronological order were jumbled. There was a note that chilled me: “If you’re reading this again, don’t trust the next page.”

On the next line, there was the name of a woman I had never seen. But when I typed the name into the municipal records system, the face that appeared was that of the woman who sits across from me on the subway every day. I felt a chill in my stomach. I went up to her that same afternoon. I asked her name, trying to sound casual. She looked at me suspiciously and answered. It was the same name. Only now, in the database record, the ""current status"" field had been changed. Before, it marked ""missing."" Now it said ""active."" Modified that very day. By me.

The most unsettling thing is that I don’t remember changing anything. But the system registered my employee ID as the author of the last edit.

I started rereading the names in the notebook. Rachel, Peter, now her. And there were others. People who appeared in my dreams, who seemed to know my routine, my habits, as if we were living intertwined parallel realities. In some cases, I found their faces in reflections — not in the physical world. As if they lived on some plane contiguous to mine.

And then came the revelation that completely unraveled me.

While reviewing old files of missing patients from psychiatric hospitals — something I would never have done before all this — I found a name registered under partial secrecy: Michael J. Hayes. Born in 1985. Data matching mine. Admission date: July 2007. Institution: St. Anselm’s Psychiatric Facility, in the Bronx. Diagnosis: dissociative identity disorder with psychotic episodes and delusions of parallel lives.

My first reaction was to refuse. Someone with the same name. An error in the records. But the file contained specific details. My mother’s name. The address of the house where I grew up. And the most unbearable: a scan of a handwritten page… containing identical excerpts from my notebook.

I couldn’t breathe. It was as if the ground had split open. I started to question if everything up to that point had just been a mental illusion. A breakdown. A long, well-orchestrated episode of delirium. But there was physical evidence. The notebook was here. The recordings too. The changes in the city weren’t an invention.

I opened the notebook that night looking for answers, but instead, I found new, freshly written pages, with phrases that froze me:

“Repetition is the key.” “He doesn’t remember being me.” “The flaw is in the recognition.”

I finally realized that I wasn’t the only one. That perhaps all versions of me were leaving messages for each other, trying to create a trail, a code, a way to escape a cycle that should never exist. But there was no clear sequence. The messages contradicted each other, as if written by people with different intentions. Some wanted to escape. Others, to remain. One of them clearly stated:

“If you erase everything, you go back to the beginning. But the beginning is the worst part.”

I couldn’t sleep that night. The notebook remained open on the table, and the figure in the mirror returned. It didn’t move, just watched me. Faceless, shadowless. Static. But now it was closer. Almost touching the glass. I stared at it until dawn, trying to understand what it wanted. A part of me knew: it was me. Or one of the versions of me. One who had given up fighting.

At the end of that week, I found one last clue. A newspaper clipping between the pages of the notebook, precisely folded. News from 1996. Car accident in Manhattan. Three victims. One survivor — Michael J. Hayes, 11 years old. The image showed a child being carried on a stretcher, covered by a blanket. But I remembered not being in that car. In my memory, the accident never happened. But what if it did? What if all this started there? What if every new memory I have comes from versions of me who died, and got stuck in a loop of forced reconstruction?

I closed the notebook. I felt my heart slow down. Not from calm, but from resignation. Because now I knew. I wasn't being haunted by an entity. I **was** the entity. A puzzle of pieces that never quite fit, trying to form a human being based on lives that failed.

The bathroom mirror now showed a spiral-shaped crack. I didn't cause it. But it grows every day. As if, finally, the reflection was ready to swallow me.

By this point, I had stopped trying to fight what was happening. The names, the faces, the overlapping realities… it had all become part of a continuous noise inside me. It was as if my mind had accepted that resisting only made things worse. I woke up every day with the same question burning under my skin: who am I now?

One silent night, I sat before the notebook with a single intention: to write my own name. To write it with conviction, like an anchor. But as I put the pen to the page, my hands hesitated. When I began to write, I realized I was spelling another name. A name I didn’t recognize. The strangest part? The handwriting was mine. And even though it seemed absurd, that signature felt… right. As if it had always been the true one.

I tried to erase, to rewrite, to force my hands to obey. But each attempt resulted in variations of the same strange name. Until, finally, the notebook closed on its own — the cover slamming shut with a dry, definitive thud. The shock made me fall from my chair. When I got up, I saw that the bedroom mirror had changed places. It was now on the door, reflecting myself… and something behind me.

It was the faceless silhouette. The same one from the video weeks ago. But this time, it was clearer. It wasn’t a shadowy, amorphous figure. It was a version of me. Same clothes. Same haircut. Same body. But with an empty, static gaze. And for a second, before the reflection faded, it smiled.

That night, I dreamed of a place that didn’t appear in my notebooks or memories. A long corridor, where doors opened and closed on their own. From each side, different versions of me emerged. Some screamed. Others whispered things I couldn’t understand. One of them just pointed forward and said: “Last chance.”

I woke up gasping. And beside me, on the bed, there was a loose page from the notebook. On it, only two sentences:

“Erase everything.” “But remember: the beginning is the worst part.”

I knew what that meant. I needed to try to reset the cycle. Break the pattern of substitutions. Be the last one, or at least, prevent the next version from starting at the same point. It was like a mechanism with a structural flaw, stuck in repetition. And I had become part of it.

I got up, went to the shelf, took out all the notebooks, loose pages, records. I burned everything in the backyard. High flames. No relief. Just silence. But, for the first time in weeks, the mirror reflected only me.

I thought I was free.

Two days later, a letter arrived. No sender, as always. Inside, just a single page. Fresh ink. Unmistakable handwriting. The first line read:

“You erased the wrong thing.”

Below, a complete paragraph. Detailed, intimate. A memory I had buried deep, one I never wrote, never shared. The memory of the day when, at seven years old, I got lost from my mother on the subway for over an hour. I remembered the smell of the train car, the texture of the cracked plastic seat, the feeling of abandonment. That memory… it was mine. And it was there, written by someone who wasn’t me. Or maybe it was.

I felt the wall of reality curve slightly. As if the whole world had breathed in, pulling air with a force that came from somewhere too deep to be reached. The bathroom mirror was now empty. No image, no light. Just a gray, opaque surface, as if it had stopped reflecting anything that still existed.

I went back to the bedroom, and on the bed there was a new notebook. Black cover. Untitled. When I opened it, I found the first page blank — except for a single sentence, at the top:

“Welcome back, Michael.”

The rest of the pages were waiting. And I… I wasn’t sure if I was the same person who wanted to destroy them.

My name is Michael Hayes. At least… that’s what I found written on the sheet taped to the refrigerator door, in handwriting I immediately recognized, although I didn’t remember writing it. The message was simple: “Don’t trust the first memories. They aren’t yours.”

I spent the whole day trying to understand what that meant. The house seemed mine. The room, familiar. In the bathroom, my toothbrush was in the same place as always. And yet, everything felt… staged. Like a carefully reconstructed set to keep me calm. But there were flaws. Things out of place. A crooked picture frame with a faded photograph, where I stood beside two smiling people — faces I should recognize, but which meant nothing.

Next to the bed, I found a black notebook. Hardcover, worn corners. And at the top of the first page, the phrase that struck me most: “I woke up in someone else’s memories.”

Since then, I’ve been trying to reconstruct my identity. Each page reveals a new layer, a memory, a name. But the more I read, the less I feel like myself. The memories aren’t linear. One minute I’m in New York. The next, in Seattle. Sometimes I’m an archivist, other times, a professor. In one passage, there are accounts of a car accident. In another, a fire. And, in all of them, a silent figure watches me in reflections. Waiting.

What frightens me isn't its presence. It’s the fact that I’ve been it before. And to know that, at some point in the past — or the future — I was the face that observed, not the one being observed.

1m2fak4,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1m2fak4/guest_review_a_rant/,Guest review: A Rant,"I (host, 1 property, 2b 1b, washer/dryer included split and closed off from the other half where I live, it's a budget rental set at $60/night) just had a guest who wrote a retaliatory review. At the start I sensed she might need careful handling. She complemented the home and then wanted for a space heater as she gets cold at night. It's 90°F+ here and we keep the whole house at 74°F. Not a big deal, I bring her the space heater. The next day she repeatedly demanded I bring her disposable plates, bowls, flatware, and coffee cups. I let her know that because there is no kitchen these sorts of supplies will need to be purchased by the guest, but that I did happen to have some disposable coffee cups since she was dissatisfied with the ceramic mugs I provide to guests. She was angry and said so and still declined, but wanted dish soap and a sponge (these items are in the cupboard with the laundry detergent for guests, but I figured she'd have a hard time with the Costco bulk dish soap, so I brought over dawn power wash and a sponge). Now to the review:

I enjoyed the comfortable beds, host provided laundry detergent for washing machine, mini refrigerator, small freezer with microwave. However, I would not recommend as place has a smell like pet urine & feces in the main room. Thermostat is unable to be controlled & is set very low. Host did provide space heater, but it was filthy & I spend some time cleaning it. We were denied plates and additional cutlery. Host gave excuses about concerns over sanitation by not having a drying rack which is false. Dishes can be air dried on a towel. She gave us weird solution of rubbing alcohol to wash the dishes with which is not food safe & potentially toxic. I was told the cups, forks and spoons already there were purchased by other guests. When asked for disposable products, an additional excuse about not being environmental friendly was given. This logic is flawed due to the recommendation to open a window while the AC was on to heat the area, AC set < 78F and giving us disposable paper. Unsafe, unkempt area.

I figured she'd be angry over me not buying her items and expected a low score review. What I didn't expect was the claim of pet feces and urine. The last guest with a pet was back on June 28th. The dog was a little guy, the guests were super clean, and there was nothing from the many guests before her about pet waste smell in the house (superhost, 4.8* all rave about cleanliness). Not to mention I was in her side twice and no smell that I noticed or complaints from her. Ugh, I'd never stay in a place like that and certainly wouldn't subject guests to that. Also, I'm absolutely judging her for wanting the AC set to 78° or higher. I'll adjust it within reason, but the space heater was more than reasonable. Anyway, she was a nightmare, the space heater was fine, I had cleaned it before storing it for the summer, and dawn power wash isn't toxic just because it has alcohol in it. The plastic flatware she found were prepackaged sets left by other guests. I placed them in a drawer on the coffee bar (I have since removed everything left behind by all guests). But unfortunately, even though she was fabricating this horrifying experience because I would not go to the store to get her items as she demanded in chat, the new review process would not take it down. Frustrating. And I know, some people do provide that for guests, I explicitly state I don't in the listing. Most people do not select a non kitchen listing to cook in it. Maybe I should remove the microwave.",1,1752776900.0,airbnb_hosts,10,1.0,False

1m2f95w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m2f95w/everyone_in_town_talks_about_the_same_man_nobody/,"Everyone in town talks about the same man. Nobody has any photos of him, and nobody can agree on what he looks like.","He introduced himself to me as the librarian. It's a small town, and in small town fashion, we only really have the essentials - the server at the tiny diner knows far too much about your personal life, the barman is acutely aware of your alcohol to mixer ratio, the florist has your anniversaries and birthdays committed to memory, and he...



He's the librarian. To me. A mild-mannered man in his early 40s with a penchant for exactly which books you'll return with a smile and a glowing review, and those you'll dislike. 



I've always been a keen reader. My husband Jordan and I met in a bookshop - him tucked away working in a quiet corner whilst nursing a coffee, and I aimlessly searching for my next read. Naturally, we ended up at the library fairly often, especially since we had only moved here two months ago and found the library to be charming in all its cosy smallness. 



I needed to return a book, so I mentioned it to him in passing - typical morning talk. I said something about heading down there, and must have brought Ellis up without thinking. Why would I have thought, after all? His response confused me:



""*Who's Ellis? Whenever we've been there together, the librarian has always been an elderly woman. Laura, or something, I'm pretty sure she said was her name.*"" 



I told him that he must be confused, but he seemed convinced that I was. We put it down to there being two librarians and pushed it out of our minds, even if that explanation made no sense given we had both talked to the librarian at the same time before, but he was already late for work, and I was barely awake, so that's what was easiest. 



When I made the short walk to return my book later that morning, a new librarian was typing away, half-obscured behind the desk. I'd never felt betrayed by my eyesight until that point - and I stumbled over my words as I read the bright red nametag brandished on her flowery blouse. 



""*Laura*""



She noticed the bewilderment on my face and spoke tenderly, ""*Are you okay, honey? You look like you've just seen a ghost!*"" 



""*Uhm, I'm sorry, but I thought Ellis was the librarian? Is he off today or something?*"" I managed to form in reply. 



""*I've been the sole librarian for longer than you've been alive. If there were an Ellis here, I'd love to pass my knowledge on, but sadly, there isn't!*"" she said, her tone equal parts jest-filled and concerned. 



I told her I must have made a mistake and went through the motions, rattled, until I had the chance to phone Jordan. I suppose I didn't put enough emphasis on the slowly creeping sense of dread I was feeling because his tone, too, was more light-hearted than I had hoped for. 



People with healthy minds don't just conjure up entire beings. Was I losing it? 



But then Jordan met someone by the name of Ellis, too. One of our neighbours, two houses to the left, whom we never had the chance to introduce ourselves to. Well, he'd taken the initiative and knocked on our door one evening when I was out grocery shopping and Jordan was home alone. From what I've learned, he said his name was Ellis and, armed with a homemade cake and a toothy grin, that he was sorry we hadn't been formally introduced yet.



Jordan assumed that he was the Ellis I had met, but the description didn't line up. The person I'd met wasn't young. Wasn't the same height. Wasn't anything like the person Jordan met. 



Curious and always up for a good mystery - even if feeling a strange unease - we asked the neighbours we had made friends with about this nebulous Ellis person. 



We shouldn't have gone looking for answers because an ugly truth reared its head soon after.



The second house to our left had been unoccupied since the owners died last year. 



It might have been pristine from the outside, with grass trimmed neatly and white picket fences showing nary a sign of being unmaintained, but the inside was devoid of life. We confirmed as much with anybody who might have known - and as soon as both Jordan and I allowed the other to know of Ellis' perceived existence, neither of us saw him again. It suddenly felt as if our lives were dragging some unknowable hitchhiker along. We would be certain that the other was around - that unmistakable sense of human presence - even when we were far apart. It was as if some concealed set of eyes had converged upon us, doing nothing more than watching. Waiting. 



Our shared experience was enough to let us know there was more to this, but just as soon as we resolved to dig a little deeper, the whispers around town started. Other, more gossip-minded townsfolk had started to connect dots that seemed to be spread far enough apart from each other they might well have been stars in countless neighbouring solar systems. Everyone in town had either spoken to or heard of an Ellis - but in such a tight-knit community, it became very clear that nobody actually *knew* anybody by that name. Not a distant inheritor of property. Not an alcoholic recluse. Nobody on the fringes of the town's tiny society - nobody with the ability to live with being ignored - went by Ellis. Nobody had any evidence of ""their"" version of Ellis existing. No letters, no photos, no text messages. Nothing. And yet, over the past few years, everybody had met Ellis or at least been told about him. All who spoke of him ended up in the same situation as we had - never seeing him again, but having that distinct feeling of being watched. 



And everybody who laid their eyes upon him described him differently. An elderly man with a stick and ancient slacks. A middle-aged man who had no memorable features. A young man with a skateboard strapped to his back. 



He was everything, all at once. 



And now the entire town finally acknowledged his existence. 



Confoundedness gave way to a quiet blanket of fear that seemed to smother the town and our new home. How do you trust your friends and neighbours when you can't trust your own two eyes? It was in the midst of this fear that an idea began to float around in hushed conversations behind shuttered blinds. 



We needed to hold a census. 



It was the only real way to determine who belonged - and who didn't. 



It was a small town with, after our recent arrival, a small population of only 172, which made what could have been a logistical nightmare somewhat straightforward. We were all to gather in front of the little old town hall on a Saturday morning, and one person would be designated to conduct a headcount. After forming neat lines and choosing who would count, our instructions were repeated to us. We were to be provided a number, and each of us would repeat it aloud after our number was called. A lady whose name I couldn't recall was to be Number 1, and the count would proceed to the back of her line before moving to the next line and counting back to the first person in that line in a snaking motion. 



My husband and I were given numbers 171 and 172.



And when the count finally reached us...



We were numbers 172 and 173. ",8,1752776811.0,nosleep,3,0.84,False

1m2f8hl,https://i.redd.it/nukd0so89hdf1.png,Fallout Manhattan Gameplay Recap: Session 5,"Scrogg was out this week, so the only players from the original party in attendance tonight were Alice and Connor. That said, we got a new Wanderer added to the party. Our session starts with her. 

This newcomer wakes in the mid morning light, lying on the ground somewhere in the New York Wastes. As she sits up and gets a read on her surroundings, she notices a rock on the ground in front of her that's covered in blood. To match that, there seems to be a wound on her head. As she tries to remember how she got that, she comes to realize that she can't remember *anything* before waking up here. 

With no real heading, she starts to wander the shattered streets. Before long, she comes up behind a man that's dressed in tattered rags and just standing in the middle of the street. Being this is the first human being she's seen since waking up, she wastes no time calling out to him and telling him her whole story of waking up and the bloody rock, etc. 

Hearing her, the man turns to her, and this is where her words catch in her throat. She sees he's an emaciated figure with sunken cheeks and rotting flesh with long, unkempt nails. This person she's talking to is, in fact, a Feral Ghoul. After a split second of almost recognition in his milky eyes, he immediately roars at and then charges her. 

In a panic, she throws a stick of dynamite at him, nailing him square in the chest and blowing him to pieces. After that excitement, she wanders a bit further, looking for somewhere safe to hide out. That's when she finds a small warehouse with a shop on the side and a neon sign reading ""Downe's Upgrades"". Heading inside, she meets Richard M. Downe, a Ghoul who recognizes the fear in her and is quick to reassure her that he's not feral or dangerous. 

Downe tells her that he's in the business of repurposing robots - specifically collecting Assaultron droids and reprogramming them for ""More than live combat scenarios."" He shows her his workshop that littered with half-finished Assaultrons, and he tells her that he's running low on parts. 

He goes on to explain that before the Great War, he was an electrical engineer at a local factory. In a joint effort between General Atomics Intl. and RobCo, the aim of this factory was to take their most popular robot models and reskin them as children's toys - with full combat capability, to protect their kids from perverts at the park. The factory was abandoned when the nukes fell, but Downe is worried that the robots didn't get shut down properly and could eventually escape into and wreak havoc in the Wasteland. That in mind, he asks if this girl would be able to find a group to go to the factory and shut everything down. And while she's there, if she can find any Assaultron parts and bring them back, he'll pay her 100 Caps per unit. And clearing out the factory is worth another 300.

This begins the quest ""A Playdate with Death"" and the radiant quest ""I Fix 'em, You...""

All that out of the way, Downe points out the girl's Vault Jumpsuit and says he's never really met someone from a Vault before - at least not alive. She asks ""Is that what I'm wearing?"" and he points out the number 20 on her suit. When she tells him she thought that was just her name, Downe shrugs and says, ""Eh... Might as well be, I guess.""

Downe then proceeds to tell the newly dubbed Twenty about another Vault not far from his shop. He says this Vault - number 16 - didn't seem to have anybody alive in it, but there was a group that he saw going into it yesterday. He encourages Twenty to check it out and see if those people can help her in any way.

So, she heads out, and within the entrance to Vault 16, Twenty meets Connor and Alice. The three get acquainted and quickly fill one another in on all of their active quests, as well as syncing up their Pip-Boy maps. With Scrogg and Dogmeat staying behind at the C.A.M.P. (this working like in Baldur's Gate 3, where the ""camp"" is wherever you set it up, and those you left behind at camp will be there no matter what the new location), Alice and Connor decide to wait on Hoboken until he's with them again. With an interest in this Dick Downe character, they ask Alice to lead them to his shop.

Downe greets the party and is able to give them a bit clearer idea of his quests than Twenty was able to. This is when - after seeing his workshop, Alice realizes that this guy is kind of a huge pervert. Connor seems impressed with his collection (to the others' chagrin) and asks if Downe has any leftover weapons from the Assaultrons he's disassembled. Downe tells him no, that he's disabled and deconstructed all weapons to use their parts for other, less-deadly things.

By this point, Alice has already walked out of the building in disgust (also because her migraines were acting up and she needed to take a dose of Mentats), and the party is soon to rejoin her. Connor tries to explain that he was only interested in weapons, not ""any of *that*,"" but Alice seems unwilling to listen. In any case, they agree that this robot factory is a good heading.

The factory being all the way in uptown Manhattan though - past what is known locally as ""The Glade"" - it's clear they have a long journey ahead of them, and thus, stop in at Madison Square for supplies. Alice picks up a box of Mentats from Thomas Ching, and Connor goes to the local munitions dealer - a punk chick by the name of Julia Wilde - to restock on dynamite.

It's at this point that I reveal to them above the table that I actually don't have anything prepared for the robot factory yet, and that all I wanted to do with it this session was tell the party about it. My players understand and decide to follow a few other breadcrumbs first.

Their first stop is to the New Radio New York station to introduce Twenty to Blue Eyes. Once there, they find the studio in a bit of a panic. DJ Taco Jones greets them but seems too caught up in what's going on now to give them much attention. So, the trio heads into the back to see Blue Eyes. Connor asks how he's doing, and he tells the group though it's hard, he is still managing to keep hold of his humanity. All the same if they can get him that anchor, that would be appreciated. When they ask what's going on at the station, all he can tell them is that it seems someone else is overriding their frequency, drowning out their station with tunes like Stars and Stripes Forever and Yankee Doodle Dandy. He says they're still trying to figure that all out, so they'll be able to tell the party more once they return with his anchor. 

Twenty then asks the group if they'd like to see where she came from, and they agree. Of course when she says ""where she came from,"" she's only referring to the bloody rock on the ground. But, it's enough to lead the party to the entrance of Vault 20.

Standing outside the massive Vault door, they find that the control panel to this one is actually locked. Alice's first thought is to try to break open the plastic cover that hides the big, red ""open the door"" button. While she is unsuccessful, her Pip-Boy connects wirelessly with the panel and unlocks the cover remotely. With a bit of a shrug, she pushes the button, but the door does not immediately open.

Instead, an intercom switches on, and she hears a voice on the other end say, ""Unauthorized access. State your business with Vault 20."" As Alice and the man on the radio banter a bit, Twenty pipes up in the background. In response, there's an immediate groan over the intercom as the man says, ""Tell me that's not who I think it is.""

He informs the party that Twenty was banned from Vault 20 and that's why she woke up outside. 

Upset by this and his refusal to open the door, Alice begins pestering the guy by constantly pushing the button on the panel, playing music into the intercom with her Pip-Boy, and repeating over and over again, ""Open up."" Joining in the chorus of obnoxity, Twenty says she wants to see her mom and starts repeatedly calling out for her.

Over the chaos of the other two, Connor speaks up to the intercom, asking to be let in if he leaves these other two behind. The guard asks what for, and Connor tells him it's simply for answers. The guy says Connor won't get much, but nonetheless agrees to let him in.

Inside Vault 20, Connor is greeted at the door by a line of Vault-Tec security guards, all weapons trained on the door to ensure nobody else follows Connor in. Soon, they're joined by the head of security who radios the Overseer and tells Connor he's welcome to go and speak to the guy.

The Overseer tells Connor his Vault was built to be a permanent refuge from the Wastes. That over nearly three centuries, they've only ever opened their door maybe 5 times. One of those was to throw Twenty out, and another was to let him in. When Connor tries to press and ask who Twenty is, why she was banished, or who her family are, the Overseer remains stubbornly tight lipped, telling him only that all of that information is classified.

A bit emboldened and not wanting to leave empty-handed, Connor asks if the Overseer will give him a Pip-Boy. At this, the Overseer's already sour expression gets worse, and he flatly tells Connor to leave his Vault right now.

Back outside the entrance, Connor finds the girls right where he left them, still using the intercom and control panel to pester security. At their wits' end, security threatens to come out and shoot her if she keeps up her if she presses that button one more time. At this and finding out he basically got nothing from the ordeal, Alice attacks the panel and actually manages to do a bit of damage to it. Satisfied, she follows Connor and Twenty out, but not before pressing the button another handful of times. As the three hear the Vault door start to open once again, they all beat a hasty retreat.

From here, they decide to ""follow up"" on the Enclave quest to bring back slaves in collars and head to the nearby Skid Row. With no real plan to speak of besides ""go there and fuck things up"", they find among the ruins and shanties and slums of Skid Row, the Enclave has set up quite the impressive compound - with basic fortifications, dozens of Gunners on patrol, and a bunker set up at the far end.

Noticing the group approaching the compound, a Gunner yells out to them and six others train their weapons on the group. Just before this, Alice is able to duck into a nearby building unnoticed. 

Inside, she finds what used to be an old florist shop. Most of the stuff inside is dead and destroyed, but she does find in the corner one intact - although wilting - bulbous plant potted in a can of Slocum's Joe coffee grounds. As Alice approaches, the plant releases a cloud of spores. She makes her Endurance check though, so with a little cough, she waves away the spores. Still, interested in the plant, she decides to take it with her.

After a look through the shop, she sees an exit that would lead into the compound. Without a second thought, she makes her way for it. 

Outside, the guard that spotted Connor and Twenty tells the pair that this is a restricted area, and unless they have business with the Enclave, he and his men are ordered to shoot on sight. Connor says their business is to return some slave collars, but the Gunner tells him unless the collars have slaves attached, they're not interested. So as a ploy for entry, Connor says he brought Twenty to be a slave. The Gunner gives a wry smile and says, ""If that's the case, let's see you put a collar on her right now.""

Before that conversation goes any further though, there's a cry of ""Intruder!"" from just slightly deeper within the compound. The Gunners at the gate turn their attention to that and rush off to investigate. Connor and Twenty of course, take this opportunity to follow them inside. 

Alice finds herself in the cross hairs of 6 Gunners, but Connor and Twenty aren't far behind. So springing into action, Alice draws her combat knife and plunges it into the nearest guy's eye socket, killing him instantly. There's a bit of a scuffle between the groups, but the party is soon able to clear that wave of Gunners.

That's when they hear someone call out to them in a Southern drawl. This man - dressed in an armored trenchcoat - tells them he is this Colonel of this company of Gunners and as reinforcements arrive, goes on to say that they've made quite the mess of his men already. The Colonel (whose name is Davis, though he never gave that to the party) reiterates that the only reason they should be in this compound, is to bring him slaves for the Enclave. So as he sees it, there are two options. Either the party goes off and brings him back some slaves, or he orders his men to open fire. 

At this, Alice says that there *is* a third option. When Colonel Davis condescendingly asks what that might be, Alice says, ""You can lick my clit,"" and then fires on him with her shotgun. 

Davis uses his coat to block the attack and then yells at his men to open fire. With this, he books it for his bunker, leaving the party to deal with his Gunners.

While the party seems severely outnumbered, they are able to eventually take out the Gunners without taking too much damage. Alice tries to run after the Colonel, but is just too late as he locks himself inside his bunker. 

But with their aggression taken out and the Gunners cleared out for now, the party regroups inside the florist shop. Connor picks up some bags of fertilizer so he can make Jet with them, and Alice shows him the plant she found. Once again, the plant weakly releases a cloud of spores, but Connor is able to resist their effects. What he realizes though, is that the plant is definitely different from any other flora native to the Wasteland. 

He remembers hearing about a location known as The Glade - a region in New York that, despite all the rubble and ruin around it, was a lush area overgrown with wild and unique plant life. He also recognizes that the plant uses its spores to influence would-be predators to bring it food. Deducing that the plant is hungry, he offers it some fertilizer. The plant does not react, however.

As Connor takes a closer look at the sickly little plant, he notices it's shaped a lot like a Venus flytrap. So, figuring it may be carnivorous, he pulls a piece of Radroach meat from his bag. The plant reacts immediately, following the meat with its bulb until Connor drops the meat into its waiting maw. Immediately, the plant snaps closed around the meat, and life returns to its stalk and leaves. 

With that, we end our session for the night. We've got a fun, new player at the table, a lot of new side quests to explore, and more threads to follow through the Wasteland. Where will adventure take our party next? Tune in next time to find out!",4,1752776770.0,Fallout,0,0.7,False

He owns a house here and seems well-settled. But something about him has bothered me for a while.

I’ve often seen him carrying a large polythene bag while heading to school. At first, I didn’t think much of it — maybe some extra books or teaching material? But it seemed odd. Typically, a school teacher would carry a lunch bag and maybe a backpack, not a huge plastic bag.

Out of curiosity, I followed him one day on my scooty. To my shock, I discovered that the large polythene bag he carries is full of household garbage — and he dumps it on the roadside while on his way to school.

This isn't a one-time thing. He’s been doing this regularly.

What’s even more frustrating is that my city’s municipal corporation **charges just ₹70 per month** for door-to-door garbage collection. That’s barely the price of a cup of coffee or a street snack — yet this person chooses to throw trash on the road instead of using a proper service. It's not about affordability; it's about mindset and attitude.

The fact that someone who is *supposed to educate children* lacks the most basic civic sense is disturbing. If this is how teachers behave, what values are they passing on to the next generation? How is India supposed to develop with this kind of irresponsible mindset

* 20-day trip from USA to Greece with my spouse and 2 9-year-olds, first time to Greece for all of us
* My kids are super into Greek mythology, so this trip was heavily planned around some of the more famous or accessible sites.
* 4-5 days worth of clothing is more than plenty for traveling in hot but pool/ocean access places - we brought too much
* Ubigi eSim worked great throughout Greece
* We almost never needed our own towels, and could have bought locally if necessary
* Having at least swim goggles was very useful
* Water shoes for the rocky beaches were crucial but basic ones are sold everywhere
* I mostly used Reddit, Rough Guide, and Rick Steves to plan this trip
* Renting cars and driving generally was easy, legit, and affordable - no IDP required
* Restaurants in Greece were so healthy and reasonably priced and English-friendly that we found ourselves basically never cooking or eating at home
* People in Greek hospitality were extremely friendly, helpful, and eager to make your experience great/perfect



Day 1

* Arrived on BA into ATH.
* Had prebooked a Welcome Pickup, specifying a larger car for the 4 people + 4 carryons, was about 60 €, got us speedily downtown.
* Stayed at Anasa Hotel Athens in Monastiraki. Paid for with points in the Chase Travel Portal. We had more than a few hiccups with this place but oddly I would come here again. Our first room we were notified there was a small water leak in the ceiling, which overnight became a huge water leak and I requested a different room. The 2nd room, our first night there, smelled intensely of stale cigarettes any time the AC ran. This was addressed the next day and finally the 3rd night was uneventful. The people here were all fantastic, including who I presume is the owner Anastasia, who “borrowed” our 9 year olds for a ladies’-time chat for about an hour to give us parents a break from them, and then brought wine up to the room! It’s also a great location, super close to Monastiraki Square and Agia Eirini Square and the excellent Aiolou pedestrian street.
* We dined at O Thanasis, which is (rightly, I think) famous for kebab and great people watching. Touristy but there are also huge groups of Greek families dining here. Gelato immediately next door is a plus.

Day 2 - Athens

* An easy morning, grabbed good coffee at Tailor Made and wandered toward the Acropolis Museum
* The AM was great, the kids/family desk was super helpful and my kids (and me!) got a lot out of this. Seeing where the Parthenon marbles are missing on the upper level (in the British Museum) was quite striking. The cafe was excellent, and we inadvertently over-ate before a food tour! Fail.
* We did the Family Food Tour with Athens Food on Foot starting around 13:45. Philippos was an awesome tourguide and we got lucky that it was just the 4 of us on the tour. He took us to I think 7 or 8 places, trying different breads, pies, oils, nuts, sweets, cheeses, raki, lukumathes, souvlaki, walking the central market (mostly closed in the afternoon), and finishing with meze. By the end we were absolutely stuffed. Do not show up to this tour anything less than ravenously hungry!
* Now stuffed and hot, we headed for our Acropolis booking for 17:00. This was kind of a mistake – we were dehydrated, it was still 90F+, and the colors would have looked better and it would have been cooler after 18:00. The top of the Acropolis like near the Erectheion and Parthenon definitely started clearing out about 19:00 but we were too tired and dehydrated to do any more for the day.
* We grabbed a quick/light dinner at Tylixto which is on a fun pedestrian street

Day 3 - Athens

* I headed to the National Archeological Museum while the rest of my family chilled and shopped. NAM is incredible and its description as “one of Europe’s best museums” is correct. Well worth the \~1.5km walk from Monastiraki/Psyrri area. Don’t sleep on the Antikythera Mechanism!
* I grabbed lunch at Kosta souvlaki - do not miss this. The beef souvlaki pitta is insane.
* We passed the afternoon at Heteroclito, which is a wine bar with a nice selection of cheeses and snacks and excellent people watching.
* We were starting to learn that trying to do basically anything outdoors between 2 and 6 when it’s 90F+ in Athens is a bad idea. We napped back at the hotel until dinner.
* We dined at the Electra Metropolis rooftop restaurant. This is a beautiful restaurant with a stunning Acropolis view and opportunity for photos. It’s a place that’s definitely trying to be continental upscale, but there are reminders that you’re in Greece like you will pour your own wine when your glass is empty. The restaurant made more than a few mistakes with dish timing (entrees brought out when appetizers were still being eaten) and their “new summer menu” was a little uneven. That said, several dishes were outstanding and the staff (and manager!) went out of their way to make it right for us. So, I would indeed recommend this restaurant.

Day 4 - Athens to Delphi

* Breakfast was a return trip to Kosta souvlaki, again, do not miss it.
* We had our rental car delivered to our hotel by Athens Car Rental. This was seamless and painless, and we were on the road. Total drive time to Delphi about 2.5hr.
* Driving on the Greek mainland was generally quite painless. The expressways were good, but with lots of toll stops, all payable with card or cash. The rest stops were generally clean, though many did not have a restaurant/cafe. 
* Grabbed lunch at the appropriately named Coffee Place in Orchomenos, a super easy coffee-cafe with sandwiches and snacks.
* We stopped at the “Crossroads of Oedipus” where there is a small plaque about being the spot where Oedipus killed his father Laius.
* Checked in to the V Hotel in Delphi, chosen because of the views from the rooms and the family room setup (2 adjoining rooms with a king bed in each). It’s also right on the edge of Delphi town. We rested until it cooled off a bit and walked over to Delphi around 17:00.
* The Delphi museum is great, but only needs about 30-45 minutes. The Naxian sphinx is something else.
* We entered the Delphi site around 18:00, having learned our lesson about managing the heat. This visit was one of the highlights of the trip for me. The archaeology and history are absolutely incredible and combined with the setting you can truly appreciate why this particular spot was so important to these folks for 1000 years. The site was nearly empty by 19:00 and it was a spiritual, almost eerie experience. Museum first, go late, stay as long as you can is a great recipe for these sites.
* Sadly, the Athena Pronaia area was closed due to risk of landslide, or somesuch.
* We dined at Epikouros in Delphi, which was one of the meal highlights of the trip. Incredible quality and freshness of ingredients, medium-big portions at reasonable prices, super friendly staff, stunning view of the valley toward the Gulf of Corinth, I couldn’t say more. Don’t miss it.
* Having read that the town of Delphi was brutally touristy and you should stay at the less-touristy Arachova, I do not agree. Delphi is touristy yes, but not cheesy/scammy/crass, parking was easy, and it’s 200 yards to the site.

Day 5 - Delphi to Meteora

* This was about a 3 hour drive total that was generally easy.
* We did pitstops at the expressway rest stops, and at Thermopylae, which is indeed a flat unexciting plain but if you can imagine in your mind’s eye how close the ancient coastline was, you can get why it was such a tight squeeze for the Persians and how the Greeks held them off. Nothing worth going out of your way for, though.
* We checked into our rental house “Sakis” owned by a Greek-American, in Kastraki. Definitely prefer Kastraki over Kalabaka, as the vibe is more local and chill. However, just being anywhere in this small region is stunning due to the monoliths everywhere.
* We did a hike/scramble up Agio Pnevma rock to the very small church and cross there, this was very cool and took about 1.5 hours total from central Kastraki. The trail starts right by Pyrgos Adrachti hotel. There is a small fountain with potable water “Nereid” just down and to the left from the trail start.
* We dined at Efrosino, which was a quaint taverna with solid food on a main corner in Kastraki so some smaller tour buses came and went, service was great.
* We caught the sunset, which was as spectacular as the photos show, from the “Main Observation Deck” of Meteora which is not a deck at all but a nicely perched set of massive boulders. Parking near here was a tad busy but not difficult.

Day 6 - Meteora

* We had a 09:00 scrambling tour with Trekking Hellas booked, but they ghosted on us! Total no-show. Ultimately this got rescheduled for later in the day.
* With the morning free, we drove up to and checked out Varlaam and Grand Meteoron. These were interesting visits, with a moderate crowd factor and lots of large tour buses around.
* Got lunch at Batalogianni Zoi right in the central part of Kastraki, it was great and with a nice shaded patio in the back.
* I flew my drone around the “main” valley of Meteora (where Roussanou is) with great success.
* Our scrambling tour with Trekking Hellas happened on the 2nd try. Chris and Giorgios were awesome guides, taking us up one of the crags between Kastraki and Kalabaka on a “via cordata” i.e. temporary ropes to a stunning viewpoint. This was a highlight of the trip for sure, even though it was again 95F+ in the afternoon.
* We got a late dinner at Taverna Bakaliarakia, which was not incredible but being immediately below and next to the town square, the kids got to play in the playground while my wife and I lounged and sipped as the sun went down, a nice experience.

Day 7 - Meteora to Hydra

* Today was a long driving day, about 6 hours total to the Metochi pier to get us to Hydra.
* After a quick expressway rest stop snack, we arrived into the Corinth/Isthmia area, and had lunch at the restaurant at O Kipos resort which is on Google as “Tavern the Garden.” It’s a nice spot because it’s seafront, and I took advantage of a brief break in our lunch service to take a quick swim, using the resort’s changing room and freshwater shower. Definitely recommend this restaurant.
* It is a bit of a long and winding and uninteresting drive through Trachia and Didima to Metochi. For the water taxi from the Metochi pier, I arranged with Eleni (aka Marina) via Whatsapp and the quick ride over to Hydra was 70€.
* We stayed at some very nice apartments at Hydras Chromata. Yiannis met us at the port and walked us to the apartments just \~200m inland/uphill. They also provided fresh bread, and some cheeses and meats and yogurts, to get us through breakfast each day. It’s right next to a couple markets and the harbor is very close – this was a great lodging option, definitely recommend.
* We walked over to Avlaki Beach, which is technically closed (you have to climb around a fence) but used by tourists and locals alike. It’s a small, rocky, and kind of choppy beach, but did the trick to cool us off.
* We dined at Plakostroto, which is kind of elevated taverna food, with excellent service and food, and a server who was a Gal Gadot lookalike.

Day 8 - Hydra

* We started with a quick horseback ride with Harriet’s Hydra Horses, with her friend Giorgios leading our “tour.” We looped over to the Kamini harbor area and through all the little back alleys and sidestreets of Hydra town. It was a cool way to see the island but with no particular viewpoint/destination and a not-so-chatty guide, it was a little disapppointing/lackluster. 
* We took our picnic lunch down to Avlaki beach again, then had drinks by the harbor for some excellent people watching. 
* We dined at Veranda, which required a reservation. The setting was great, and the food was consistently excellent even if the service wasn’t particularly. The best single thing we ate in Greece was here, the octopus with some sort of garlic sauce with smoky and savory elements, delicious.

Day 9 - Hydra to Epidavros and Nafplio

* We took the regular ferry back to Metochi pier which leaves Hydra on the odd hours and was like 25was more like 26€ for the 4 of us.
* We drove onward to Epidavros with a plan to snorkel at the “Sunken City.” We rented snorkels from the very helpful Vicky at Scuba Blue Dream in Epidavros town, then headed down to Athina Tavern, which is like 50m down the beach from the Sunken City. We had lunch here at the tavern (in part so we could park there, I was a little leery parking elsewhere with a car full of all of our stuff) which was great and they have nice local olives being sold here too.
* Snorkeling at the Sunken City was very cool. It’s only about 40m offshore in about 2m of water. There were a few nearby sailboats and a few other swimmers nearby, but for the most part it was very quiet and serene here. I did some nice drone photography here.
* We moved on to the Sanctuary of Asklepius at Epidavros. We were fairly worn out from this day so we didn’t give it that fair of a shake, but the theater here was as stunning as promised and the small museum was interesting. My kids did have a go at speaking in the theater, this was a pretty special experience for them actually.
* We arrived into Nafplio to check into Anthemion Suites. If you are in Nafplio and have a car, this is an excellent option. The pool is beautiful and the restaurant is very high quality, and a bit pricey. It’s on a quiet, basically rural road but still only about 2km to Nafplio center. The service, as was the case throughout Greece, was excellent.
* We dined at Taverna Aiolos, which was on a nice quiet side street (with fans!), buzzy, tasty, and friendly.
* As we were strolling to find gelato, we came across a youth festival of traditional dance - hundreds of Greeks on the main square, all clapping and cheering for kids in traditional dress doing traditional dance. It was one of those “oh this is a real town for real Greeks” moments, very special.

Day 10 - Nemea, Mycenae

* We had lunch at Stavropolous in Nafplio, a buzzing souvlaki/kebab place that was really fun, nice big portions, and delicious food.
* Then we drove the \~30min north to Nemea. The Temple of Nemean Zeus was one of the best sites of the trip, as it’s one of the only temples where you can walk among the reconstructed-and-original columns. The museum is small but useful.
* Next we went to Palivou Estate winery. I had tried to book ahead but didn’t get a response. The hostess was very gracious to pour us a few glasses as they had just gotten a large tourgroup of Lithuanians (!) that took all their attention. Ultimately, the wine here was excellent and the folks were very friendly and they have a nice dog. The Kydonitsa white and Ammos red were standouts, amongst the best wine we had in Greece.
* The Nemean temple ticket includes the Nemean Stadium, which is very cool and worth \~30 minutes or so. The ancient athlete’s tunnel and running on the actual stadium are incredible experiences.
* Next, we went to Mycenae, grabbing snacks in the town of Mykines. Mycenae was stunning, and again, by going later in the day (18:00) the museum and site were largely empty. Go late, museum first, stay late. All in all the visit took about 2 hours including the “Tomb of Agamemnon.” My kids know the mythology associated with this site so they mostly spent it climbing and exploring around on their own.
* We dined at the restaurant at Anthemion where the food was exquisite and poolside and all of 10m from our room!

Day 11 - Nafplio

* I checked out the Nafplio museum while my family shopped for souvenirs and crafts. Nafplio feels as-yet-unruined by mass tourism because it has all of the European/Venetian charm one could want without any of the crassness or overcommercialization. The museum is really only worth it for the “Dendra Panoply” which is a very intact set of armor from the Bronze age - nerds only.
* All our parking in Nafplio was at the big port parking lot just north of the big traffic circle - parking was easy and free here.
* We had a very leisurely lunch at Palio Archantiko taverna and strolled/shopped some more as a group before our sailing trip.
* We sailed with Nafplio4Sail on the “semi-private catamaran half day” tour in the afternoon. This was also a highlight of the trip. My kids had a blast and we stopped at several coves/beaches, which maybe were not the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, but the vibe with a mixed group of Europeans all snorkeling and SUPing around was great and the light late in the day (we returned around 20:00) was spectacular.
* For some reason we decided we needed dinner so we ate at Kalleri, which was fine but we over-ordered and were stuffed.

Day 12 - to ATH and Crete

* We drove the 2h from Nafplio to ATH airport and returned our rental car with ACR - very smooth.
* After the quick flight to Heraklion, we picked up another car with AutoRentals Crete and drove to our stay for the next 4 nights, Stella Palace Aqua Resort (SPAR).
* SPAR was a great experience and I would 100% go back. All inclusive food (the buffet was legitimately good), a kids club morning and afternoon (not Sundays), the incredible waterpark that opens at 10 and the waterslides run 11-17 every day, sports and social activities, nightly movie for kids and dancing and stuff for adults, this was an excellent stay. By US standards, it is also excellent value. The clientele was probably 50% Germans and the rest mostly UK folks, no Americans that I could tell. Most of the guests were families, many with very young children (age 1-5 probably the most common). Getting sunbeds was never an issue, and there were so many pools to choose from, and, we had splurged for the “maisonette” with its own pool.

Day 13-15 - Stella Palace and Knossos

* We left the resort just once, with our rental car, to go to Knossos and Stilianou winery.
* Knossos left us a little disappointed, maybe because it was the only site that was kind of crowded, and there’s a semi-scam with one of the parking lots, but also because there’s no museum on site and the restorations are so colorful that it just has a very different feel.
* Stilianou winery was fantastic - we had arranged ahead for wine tasting as well as olive oil tasting, and we bought some of their olive oil, it was incredible. The wines were very nice, though the pours were quite stingy. It’s set up with a beautiful view over the vineyards and olive orchards stretching out to the mountains. The drive there is a little hairy as you go straight through a tiny, tiny town and its narrow lanes to get there.

Day 16 - drive to Chania

* We departed the Heraklion area in our rental car. Driving the main road east-west in Crete is just not fun at all, because of the constant attempts to pass or be passed, the big trucks, the occasional ultraslow driver obeying the speed limit, etc.
* There is a nice stretch of beach very close to the main road west of Rethymno and Petres, we stopped at Kantina Summer beach bar here for a snack and a quick swim.
* Our next stop was Dourakis Winery which was truly great, their oaked white wines were fantastic and the food at lunch was very tasty. They did a free cellar tour, and they have a big shady outdoor area, and the winery is not far off the main road. Of the three wineries we went to in Greece, this was the best. Highly recommend.
* We checked into our apartment at Square45. This is a very stylish 2BR apartment I found on Booking, very walkable both to the Chania harbor but also Nea Chora beach which is quite “urban” but useful. The owner lives upstairs and is super friendly and the apartment has everything you’d want, including a parking space!
* We had dinner at Mezedoskoleio (“School of Meze”) which had a tasty array of smaller plates, friendly service, and reasonable prices - a recurring theme in Greece.

Day 17 - Balos Beach 

* We splurged on a private Balos Beach tour with Seaze The Day leaving in the morning. Our captain Nikos was great, and took us to Gramvousa island first where we snorkeled around near the shipwreck in the chilly water there (maybe 21C?). Then we headed over to Balos Beach which is truly stunning, and quite incredible if you’re there before the big ferry arrives around 11:30 – after it arrives, it’s a damn zoo. We made one more stop to swim on the way back and had a light snack/lunch of sandwiches and fruit.
* We had lunch at Roubini Beach Cafe, another great beachfront taverna with sunbeds and swimming and water rentals right there – I’m sure there are hundreds of these along the Cretan coast.
* We dined at Pizza Tartufo, which was probably the only mid/bad dining service experience we had in all of Greece. They have a strange (for Greece) order at the counter system, they screwed up our wine without making it right / discounting it, and crammed the 4 of us onto a table really meant for 2. That said, the pizza was fairly good. 

Day 18 - Chania 

* We headed out to spend the absolute hottest hours of the day meandering around Chania, which isn’t a wise choice per se from a temperature standpoint.
* We had lunch at Tamam which was good not great I thought, the people were super friendly and it’s an institution (and they have AC inside!).
* While my family shopped I checked out the museum of ancient ships and walked the seawall out to the Chania lighthouse.
* I cooled off at Mamouth cafe, which is on a shady corner with some interesting people watching and near a few fun alt/gothy shops like a tattoo shop, DirtyDolls, Barfly, etc.
* We had to have a harborside dinner and deal with the touristiness, so we ended up at Amphora on the harbor. Probably because they advertise “we won’t bug you”. My wife loved their stuffed calamari, and the harbor views as the sun set were magical. Chania isn’t the kind of place where people really come bug you while you are dining (e.g. rose guy, beggars etc) 

Day 19 - Elafonisi 

* On our last full day in Greece we headed to Elafonisi. It’s about a 90 minute drive from Chania and not a fun one at that - much of it on windy mountain roads and often stuck behind extremely slow tourist drivers.
* That said, the beach is stunning. We parked at Mega parking (the one with no scams), did the short walk down to the beach, where they were almost out of sunbeds by about 10:00. The snack bars here had decent food at decent prices considering the remoteness. It was a tiny bit chilly in the morning but warmed up in the afternoon and the beach is so fun to explore. Highly recommend.
* We dined at Taverna Charas in Voulgaro, getting the proper mountain-village-taverna experience. (Many of the tavernas were actually booked for weddings so it took a while to find one!).

Day 20 - Home

* Dropped the car with AutoRentals Crete at CHQ (the guy was so friendly, he insisted on driving me the 300m to the terminal) and then had a relatively uneventful return trip via Munich to the USA.

1m2f7ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/b2bmarketing/comments/1m2f7ef/what_does_chatgpt_agents_mean_for_b2b_marketing/,What does ChatGPT Agents mean for b2b marketing?,"OpenAI just launched ""ChatGPT Agent"". Short story: It can use its own computer. And they trained it to be really good at creating PowerPoint slides for you. 

Long story....

It combines the best bits of Operator (which I have long championed), Deep Research, o3, and the ChatGPT interface. It can run for 30-40mins on complex tasks using a range of tools to get a job done. Those tools include a web browser, image generator, deep research, and writing code. It uses the existing data connectors to grab content from your own web apps (SharePoint, Teams, Google Drive, Github etc..) to work with your tools.

But what does it mean for b2b marketing? Well in short EVERYTHING. 

*This post is aimed at marketing teams, departments or agencies (I run an agency focused on b2b marketing).* 

ChatGPT Agent is the latest in a trend of AI products with 2 key features. First they have tools. That means they can do a bunch of different things (and they choose themselves when and how to use them). Two of these tools are searching the web and writing the code. These open up a huge number of sub capabilities. The second key feature is the ability to work for an extended period of time ""on their own"". Combined this means this sort of AI product can be given a fairly complex task and be left to do it.  By go to example for b2b marketing.... putting together the monthly social media report for a wider team or the board. It normally looks a bit like this:   

* Login to LinkedIn and note down the data in Word
* Do the same in X, or use a third party tool you connected to it
* Do the same in Instagram or any other platform you need
* You've already lost an hour
* Then login to Google Analytics to grab relevant website data
* This is an hour by itself, GA is a nightmare I think
* Then you've got a load of numbers, time to fight with PowerPoint to make a deck
* Spend 3hrs doing this, trying to keep it all on brand
* Finish and make coffee to celebrate
* Remember you have forgotten to add any insights, go back and do that
* You've spent all day on it now.
* Finish up by emailing it to the team, and wait for the 100 questions by return email

ChatGPT Agent can do this whole process for you. It won't do it lightening quick right now. It will ask you for a nudge along the way, and the deck won't be perfect (but will be better than 50% of people who make terrible decks for a living). But it will work. And it can chug away in the background why you do something else.

For 90% of inhouse and agency b2b marketing teams this IS AMAZING!

And this is one use case. There are 100s of others:

* Drafting campaign performance reports from multiple platforms
* Updating buyer personas or ICP docs using CRM and call data
* Creating competitor intelligence summaries from online sources
* Rewriting landing pages for different personas
* Pulling proof points for case studies or sales pitches from internal docs

There is a lot of hype around AI (duh!) but one thing as far as I can see is 100% the WAY we work is changing. Normal office workers need to skill up and learn how and why they can command an army of agents to do 70% of their day to day, and what that means for their now free time?",1,1752776701.0,b2bmarketing,5,1.0,False

Arrived Thu, July 3 ~ 11am at Malpensa MPX. Immigration took 15-30mins - super quick.

Bought tickets for Malpensa Express (MXP1) to SARONNO (€8/person) at Airport station ticket box (?) - there was a long line for that but an attendant was helping. Recommend buying online on Renee app (did this otw back). 

Then at Saronno, had to buy tickets (~3€/person) to COMO LAGO (R17). Ticket office is passed the coffee shop - everyone was struggling to find it. Again, recommend buying your tickets on Renfe.

Then at Como Lago, we had option for Bus or Ferry to BELLAGIO but opted for the C30 Bus (~4€/person) cuz heard the horrors of the ferry lines. Bus at 1.55pm was relatively full but everyone got on even with their big luggages. Fair warning that the 1hr bus ride is a roller coaster with all the sharp turns and slamming breaks so hold on tight! P/S you can use credit card to pay for the fare on the C30 bus - easy tap and go!

Otw back on Sunday morning July 6th, since hubby was not a fan of the C30 Bus into Bellagio, we gave the Bellagio > Como fast ferry (~45min, ~14€/person) a shot. Bellagio ticket office opened around 7.30am (supposedly 20mins before the 1st ferry which was 7.50am). Went to ticket counter around 7.25am and there was 5 people in line to buy tickets and 1 person in line for 1st ferry - was a breeze! Make sure to triple check ferry schedule because Google Maps was not correct, there are different times for their Mon-Sat vs Sun schedules.

Fair warning tho when we reached Como, there was probably ~75 people in line there to get on ferry to Bellagio.

Safe travels all!

The game is adapted for PC and phone browsers, active players decide on further updates, no pay 2 win. For optimal play, it is recommended to log in and take action every 10 hours.

Warera is about war, politics and business. Just like in the real world.

Politics - each country has its own government (President, Vice President, Parliament, Ministers of Defence and Economy), the government makes the laws of the country (peace/war, alliance, taxes, etc.) and oversees the general order of the country.

War - through the prism of politics, you annex other countries territories and resources. Players from other countries can join the war (attack/defend).

Business - you can take up employment, create your own companies, employ other people, sell or use the resources you produce.

Whole Europe is currently under attack from players in the Latin American alliance (including Spain and Poland) who have a significant player advantage. France, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Romania, Greece and many others are oppressed by Latin American and their allies forces.

1m2f4hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m2f4hk/aita_for_taking_a_train_to_the_airport_without_my/,AITA for taking a train to the airport without my friend?,"My friend (33F) and I (34F) were going on a trip, to our common friend’s wedding abroad. We had to catch a train to the airport to catch a flight. The train leaves once an hour. As I absolutely despise of having to rush through airports, I planned it out so we would take a train that would get us there early, where the train an hour later could be a plan B, just in case the first train was canceled. 

My friend tends to be late, but agreed to the plan that I screenshotted and sent, where I also emphasized the importance of being on time in this particular context. While waiting at the train station, she calls me, informing me that she is running a bit late since she could not find her keys - she tells me to ask the train conductor if they can delay the train a few minutes… I refuse to do this, I would be mortified if I did. This is a long-route European train used by many commuters, with multiple connections. Of course it cannot wait for a lady who forgot her keys. Despite her insistence, I keep refusing. Then she asks me to wait for her at the station, so we both take the train an hour later, which I also refuse (slightly offended by the previous insistence).

Fortunately so. The airport was a mess, but I didn’t have to stress. I managed to check in my suitcase, go through security, get a coffee and after that I was waiting in line to board. My friend called me, angry, as she had to dispose of a bunch of liquids due to not having time for checking in luggage, and called me from security. She knew I had checked in luggage, and wanted me to stall by not boarding (the ground staff would have to remove my suitcase, which may delay the flight, so she might make it). I refused to do this, but promised to talk to the ground staff, and inform them that she was waiting in line at security and ask them to keep the gate open (which I did).

She made it on the flight at the last second, sweaty and panting, and was angry that I did not wait nor do as I was told during the process. AITA for sticking to my original plan?",3,1752776514.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False
1m2f4b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m2f4b9/what_should_i_do_im_extremely_bored_at_work/,What should I do? I'm extremely bored at work.,"

Throw away account because I don't want to be recognized complaining about my job.

Okay, I know... what am I even complaining about? First world problems and all that. People would dream about being in my shoes. I've got to do nearly nothing, I am home on time (like 3pm-ish), not to mention all the benefits (I'm talking company car, unlimited fuel, top of the line health insurance, pension plan, plenty of PTO, the whole nine yards) aaaand... I'm miserable. Do I sit it out? The smart choice would be yes but I feel too young to be this bored out of my mind. 

  
It doesn't help that I only have a high school diploma and I'm earning more than my higher educated friends (two of which have their masters degree) and its not like opportunities like this are growing on trees for me. I guess the real question is... how do I make the boredom manageable because right now, its sucking the life out of my soul?

  
For some relative background information. I'm not working from home (otherwise I would be able to busy myself just fine), nor in an office environment, I visit clients and my office is my car. The visits are relatively short, mostly informative (so it depends on how many questions/problems my clients have), I don't have to do too many of them in a day (it depends on demand really) and they're usually spaced pretty close to one another. The latest I have been home was 16:20PM and I have time to kill in between visits during which I've just been doom-scrolling for now (that definitely doesn't contribute to my general happiness). At first I went on lunches/coffee stops in trendy looking places, went shopping and even had my hair done in between clients but I noticed that became very expensive, very fast and though I make good money, I'm also paying the mortgage on my house all by myself. 



I've been trying to come up with things do myself but have been coming up short. The idea is to stay away from social media and I don't really watch tv (my tv is literally unplugged at home, a running joke among my friends). I enjoy cooking, tending to my garden (truthfully I only enjoy the results, not the actual work but oh well), going out with friends and reading.  There's only one of those that I can do during working hours but I do tend to get too absorbed and struggle putting a good book away. Reading a non interesting book isn't going to chase my boredom away, I'm afraid. It would be really great if I could do something productive and I tried the whole surveys for money thing but it was crap experience (half of the surveys crash halfway through and you just wasted half an hour with zero pay and if you do finish one you get like... 40cents). Any other ideas? I'm hoping you guys have some more creativity then me. ",1,1752776504.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1m2f0n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1m2f0n6/picking_and_choosing_in_the_bible/,Picking and choosing in the Bible,"I know other religions do this all the time, but the Bible and Christianity are by far the biggest offenders.

Whenever I have to go to church with family, inlaws, etc. they all do the same thing - loudly exalt the comfortable, accepting parts of the bible while ignoring or dismissing the parts they don't like. They talk about meeting with the sick, giving donations to the church (lol), and how children should respect their parents while ignoring the other parts of the bible like blood sacrifices, women being subservient to men, slavery being a-okay, and not eating shellfish or wearing clothes made of different fabrics. Hell, earlier today when I was grabbing coffee I overheard a priest talking to a woman about how his congregation ""casts aside the hatred and discrimination in the bible and chooses to preach about Christ's love."" 

But whenever you ask them about it, the answer is all the same - ""it was a different time,"" ""those don't apply in this day and age,"" and so on. And if, heaven forbid, a non-believer chooses to pick and choose and point out their cherry picking, we're told we ""don't get it"" and ""have no right to judge or criticize.""

So that raises the question, if you choose to ignore those bad parts, why don't you ignore the rest? Or the whole thing? Religion cannot be an all or nothing thing, either you adhere to its rules or you don't jive with it. There are no half measures.",2,1752776276.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False

If your heart races when the news is on...
If social media leaves you feeling like you’re behind in life...
If your mind doesn’t know how to *shut up* at 3 a.m...
That’s not just in your head. This world *literally* profits from your anxiety.

You’re being hit with noise 24/7—notifications, bad news, expectations, comparison traps, productivity hacks, pressure to ""heal"" fast, glow-up, hustle, repeat.
And somewhere in the chaos, we forget the simplest truth:
**Peace isn’t found. It’s reclaimed.**

### Here’s how I started reclaiming mine. Maybe it’ll help you too.

**1. Turn down the volume (literally and emotionally).**
I muted 90% of my notifications. I unfollowed accounts that made me feel like crap.
I realized: if the first thing I consume every day is anxiety-inducing content, I’m handing over control of my mind before I even brush my teeth.

**2. Ask yourself: “Whose voice is this?”**
That inner critic? That urgency? That shame?
So much of it isn’t even *ours.*
It’s borrowed from parents, bosses, social media, capitalism.
I started pausing and asking: “Would I say this to a friend?”
If not—then why am I saying it to *me*?

**3. Let it be messy.**
Peace doesn’t mean perfect. It means *safe.*
It means not flinching at your own thoughts.
Some days, peace looks like crying in the shower.
Other days, it looks like walking barefoot outside just to *feel* something real.

**4. You don’t have to fix yourself to deserve rest.**
This one hit me hard:
You are allowed to rest *before* you burn out.
You are allowed to exist *without* being productive.
Read that again.

**5. Create micro-moments of quiet.**
Not everything has to be a 10-step morning routine.
Sit in your car before going in.
Breathe before answering that email.
Drink your coffee *without* scrolling.

Small. Human. Gentle. That’s the way back.

---

💬 **If this hit something inside you, I’d love to know:**

* What helps *you* find peace when the world won’t slow down?
* What’s one thing you want to let go of this week?

Let’s remind each other:
You are not broken. You are reacting normally to a very loud world.
And you’re allowed to come home to yourself—without guilt.
