1nkpk1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kuwait/comments/1nkpk1x/simple_social_meetups_in_kuwait/,Simple Social Meetups in Kuwait,"Honestly, even being from Kuwait, I find it hard to have a simple social group here. It‚Äôs not easy to invite people I don‚Äôt know to a house or a chalet. So I thought ‚Äî why not keep it simple?

The idea:
	‚Ä¢We meet once a week (or every now and then)
	‚Ä¢Grab a coffee, go for a walk, just hang out
	‚Ä¢No big commitments, no costs ‚Äî everyone pays for themselves
	‚Ä¢An opportunity to meet new people and make friends
	‚Ä¢Chill, respectful, no judgment vibes

It‚Äôs open for everyone ‚Äî Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis, English or Arabic speakers.

And  of course if you have an activities in mind I‚Äôm more than happy to listen. 

If you‚Äôre interested, drop a comment or DM ü™Ñ

1nkpjno,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1nkpjno/no_espresso_but_tasty_fauxffogato/,No Espresso But tasty 'Faux-ffogato'!,"I've tried to 'mimic' espresso to no avail, and I'm considering buying the FELLOW Prismo so as to introduce air bubbles or fake crema. Still this recipy tasted way better than I thought it would, kind of an affogato:

* Aeropress
* \~(15-18)g fine grind (22 clicks on kingrinder p0 \[i know not suited for it but experimentally good\])



* Add 1 Scoop of Ice cream to cup (I love Haagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream)
* Inverted method!!
* Add coffee (try to not add fines, so a bit of sifting, but keep them)
* add 120ml water, 80C (175F), or if plunger rests at mark 4, fill up to mark 1
* swirl (about 5 times, no circular motion)
* wait 50 secs
* Add fines
* Soak them with \~(10-20) ml water
* swirl (about 3 times, again no circular mtion)
* wait 20 secs
* Invert the aeropress with the mug and swirl everything around for 3 times
* push down with force (Usually generates about \~1 Bar of pressure, say 15/20 secs)
* Enjoy

I feel this way the sweetness contradicts the forceful push's bitternress, and thus makes for a full bodied coffee that is still sweet. If no icecream the no force, 40 to 45s pushdown and maybe a bit more water (200ml)",1,1758242996.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False
1nkpiwl,https://i.redd.it/gnjjxvajh0qf1.png,explaining Kenny's lore (also I need help with something),"so yeah I was wondering what voice would sound fitting for kenny just based on his lore and overall vibe so if your okay with it please leave suggestions in the comments on a voice that might fit him anyways ONTO THE LOREEEEEEEEEEEE

so detective Kenny Franklin Carter was born in 1938 in Boston Massachusetts and at the age of five was abandoned by his parents leaving him to the foster system in which he grew up alongside two other men who he considers and calls his brothers (will make a post on them later on), growing up he never had a father figure same as his two brothers leading to this feeling that he needed to prove himself because he never really knew his dad all too well and had this feeling in the back of his mind that he wasn't good enough which is why he was abandoned

cutting over to his adult life he became a cop at the age of 20 and served four years as a successful police officer in LA during that time he would act arrogantly, reckless and dismissive presenting himself as the best of the best and in 1962 he went alone to a drug bust believing he would be enough alone he ended up being wrong to an insane degree and was shot in the stomach point blank with a shotgun causing him to bleed out and die.

  
for his arrogance he was sent to hell and not knowing what to do took up work as a private detective and mercenary which he became well known for throughout the 70's and 80's until he was given the job of investigating Carmilla Carmine leading to a fight between the two ending in a draw and eventually creating a friendly rivalry with both of them respecting one another until one day he was offered a truce by Carmilla in exchange for resources such as angelic weaponry and a backing from her business leading to the two meeting and eventually over time falling for one another going on their first date in 2005 giving Kenny a sense of belonging and eventually he proposed to her leading to the two of them marrying

during this time Kenny sold his soul to Alastor whilst drunk and stressed becoming an ally of the hotel and considered an honorary overlord not official but the closest he could really get to being one

anyways thats his whole backstory and shit now I want to get onto various things I have about Kenny and such

he is incredibly snarky and often pisses off overlords such as the vees with his comments about them

he is close friends with zestial and goes bowling with him every Wednesday night

at first his relationship with Carmilla's daughters clara and odette was horrible but eventually they came around and started to view him as a genuine father figure

he was encouraged to propose by one of his brothers who ended up in hell (the other one ended up in heaven)

his fighting style is pretty much that of captain america using a shield (look it sounds fun and unique compared to something like another swordsman or marksman)

he has both autism and adhd

his first date with carmilla consisted of them getting coffee and a walk around the entertainment district of hell

he has a massive rivalry with the three vees specifically velvette

when he fights he cracks jokes and will normally have a cocky smirk on his face as he does so

  
anyways thanks for reading all this and if you have any voice suggestions, please feel free to leave them down in the comments below and have an amazing day",1,1758242935.0,HazbinHotelOCArt,0,1.0,False

1nkpian,https://i.redd.it/dn69c5lbp0qf1.png,Radio killed the video star full transcript,"
[The episode opens with an exterior shot of the Hazbin Hotel before cutting to inside with Charlie pacing back and forth in panic mode. KeeKee was in the shot, walking alongside her owner.]

Charlie Morningstar: Okay. So, the extermination is coming in six months instead of a year! No big deal, just a little setback. Nothing we can't handle. Just angels cutting our timetable in half, but who needs a whole year to save souls, am I right?! *Starts to panic* And next time when they cut the time in half again, and again, we'll just handle it, right?!

[Vaggie grabs Charlie, calming her down.]

Vaggie: Yes. We will.

Angel Dust: Oh, please, ya had less then half a chance when you started all this salvation bullshit. And now... (phone vibrates with violent threating messages such as ""fucking bitch"") Ain't no silver lining this time, toots.

Charlie Morningstar: Sure there is! We just...have to look a little harder for it!

Angel Dust: Well, while you're lookin', the rest'a hell's goin' nuts. [Angel waves his phone in their faces.] People are already freakin' out about the news. Look at what's happenin' in the Doomsday District.

[He scrolls down an article with the bottom showing a demon screaming in front of a fire. Suddenly a pink message appears. Charlie gets closer to read it.]

Charlie Morningstar: Err, what is a... ""donkey show""?

[Angel panics and retreats the phone back.]

Angel Dust: Aah, heh, nothin'. My boss, Val, is just freaked out about the news too. Like I said, everyone's losin' their shit.

Vaggie: Yeah, that's true. Sinners are desperate. Maybe desperate enough to try anything to escape the extermination?

Charlie Morningstar: (Gasps) This is the perfect time to recruit more sinners for the hotel!

Angel Dust: Cute idea and all, but you really gonna go out in all of this? [Waves the phone with the place still on fire and demons in panic.]

Charlie Morningstar: Well, it's not like people are just gonna show up on our doorstep -

[Suddenly, a massive explosion made Charlie scream in fright from behind, getting their attention. They turn to see a freshly made hole in the wall, then cuts to outside to see Sir Pentious zeppelin armed for battle. The scene cuts inside to see him and his Egg Boiz scattering around.]

Sir Pentious: Show yourself Alasssstor! Come and face-

[Pentious pauses for a moment when he notices Alastor absent from the freshly made hole. He then looks to see him sipping coffee on the balcony of the second floor.]

Sir Pentious: Oh, there you are. Face my wrath!

Alastor: Who are you?

Sir Pentious: Who am I? Who am I?! I am the great Ssssssir Pentiousssss!

[Alastor dissolves into fog as he descends to the ground, materializing aside Angel, Vaggie, and Charlie who are in the scene watching Sir Pentious' zeppelin.]

Sir Pentious: Inventor, architect of dessstruction, villain extraordinaire!

Egg Boi: Ooh! You tell 'em, boss!

[Niffty appears on Alastor's right shoulder, clearly starstruck.]

Niffty: Ooooooh, he's a bad boy~

[Alastor scoops Niffty up and drops her to the ground.]

Alastor: Ha, well if all that's true, you'd think I'd have heard of you.

Sir Pentious: I attacked you literally last week.

[Alastor cocks his head.]

Sir Pentious: We've done battle, like... 20 times?

Alastor: Well, you must have been really bad at this.

Sir Pentious: Silence! Now cower! For when I've ssslain you, the almighty Vees will finally acknowledge me as their equal.

[Niffty reappears on Alastor's shoulder.]

Niffty: Ooh! Wait, who are the Vees?

Alastor: Oh, nobody important.

[Cut to the Vees' headquarters. A large crowd is in front of a store as they watch an advertisement on the tvs facing the window showing off a spy drone.]

Ad: New VoxTek designer voyeur scopes. Peeping on the neighbors has never been more stylish. VoxTek! Trust us with your money!

[Crowd immediately enters the store and stampedes out with boxes with voyeur scopes. then cuts to random people watching their computers laptops and phones, and reveals their eyes signifying the work of hypnosis.]

Ad: This week's episode of ""Yeah, I Fucked Your Sister, So What?"" is brought to you by VoxTek. Trust us with your entertainment!

[Shifts to tapping fingers as we enter a large room with tvs showing off numerous consumers as ""trust us"" repeats and overlaps. electricity courses as Vox stands up from his chair laughing maniacally from his viewer's consumerism.]

Vox: Muhahaha! Now that's good television!

[Suddenly his screen-face shifts to reveal an icon of Velvette, another one of them Vees, signifying she's calling, with a clown horn ringtone. Vox courses the call from his screen to his hands his hand via his electric powers and transfers it to one of his many screens to reveal Velvette in her studio, her hair into a large ponytail. Vox then sits down on his chair.]

Vox: Hello there, Velvette! How are you this hellish morning?

Velvette: Oh, cut the shit, Vox. I need you up here now!

[Vox looks to one of his screens as he gets his coffee cup and drinks from it.]

Vox: Whatever could be the problem, my dear?

Velvette: Your little boy toy is wrecking my department, while I'm trying to pull together a show and-

[Off-screen, we see several workers running and screaming, and objects being tossed, as Valentino is heard cussing.]

Valentino: (In Background) THAT FUCKING BITCH!

Velvette: Just get your ass here, NOW! ...Damn it, Valentino!

[The call ends, and Vox's smile fades away as he gets up sighing, fixing up his bowtie.]

Vox: Oh yeah. And here I go, Valentino. Just another fucking day with Val. Hey-hey-hey. Fuck my life.

[Vox then walks up to a platform, which rises up.]

[Cut to an elevator with a smiling Vox with the world bubble saying ""trust us!"", before opening to reveal a frowning Vox in the same position, sighing, and then putting on a smile for a crowd of reporters that overlap one another before pointing their microphones to him.]

Reporter: Mr. Vox! What are your thoughts about the new extermination deadline?

Vox: My dear people! We at VoxTek Enterprises have always been at the forefront of innovation. And now, with this new oncoming threat, we are shifting our focus, to your protection. We are pleased to announce-

[The screen zooms to him and an ad featuring the VoxTek logo, now gold and with angelic wings, with the tagline reading-]

Vox: VoxTek Angelic Security is coming soon! Trust us, with YOUR safety.

[Vox uses his left eye to hypnotize the crowd the same way as his consumers.]

Manager: Uh sir, when did we begin working on Angelic Security?

Vox: Thirty seconds ago. [walks off] Try to get that bitch Carmilla on the books and cancel all my appointments today. I have a fire to put out upstairs.

[He then morphs his body into electricity and generates itself into the security camera on the wall.]

[Cutting to Velvette's studio. The staff cleans everything up as she looks to four designers holding up dresses to show her]

Velvette: Ugh. No. Unacceptable. You're fired. What is this? WRIST RUFFLES?! Is this 1750?! BURN IT like the witches who wore it!

[As she sends the designer away, Vox appears next to her.]

Vox: Velvette! I can see you're busy. Tell me, where's our hot-headed friend now?

Velvette: Up in his tower, waiting for a flat-faced prince to calm him down!

Vox: (sighs) And uh, what's got him so out of sorts today?

Velvette: Who knows? But he tore up my best model! And you know, the show can't wait for that unlucky bitch to pull herself back together! Melissa! Get over here!

[Melissa nervously runs onto the platform, and Velvette uses her overlord powers to change her outfit by swiping her hand, one after another until she spots the one she wants.]

Velvette: No. No. Hideous. I want to die. Eww. (gasp) Yes! That's the one.

Vox: Ahh, looks like you have everything under control here.

Velvette: Of course, I do! Fuck you! (flips him off) Now shoo! Take care of the piss baby!

[Vox goes upstairs and is greeted by two moth demons who open the door for him. Once he enters. he finds Valentino sitting on his couch surrounded by a fog of red smoke. When Val notices Vox, he sits up with fury in his eyes]

Valentino: Fucking FINALLY! [throws the cocktail glass] Kitty! Another drink!

[The Robo Fizz next to him nods as it quickly heads off screen and re-appears with the drink.]

Valentino: Can you believe what that piece of shit did? THE UNGRATEFUL WHORE!!!

[As he speaks, he tosses the drink at Vox, who moves away making the drink, hits the door, and shatters on the floor.]

Vox: Uh, which whore are we talking about this time?

Valentino: *gets up* Fucking Angel Dust! [walks up to him] Who the hell else would I be talking about?! *walks past him* That fucking SLUT walked out on me! [turns to Vox] ME! I fucking made him! *Vox walks a little way away* Without me, he's just a bag of meat with some mildly entertaining holes.

Vox: Oh! Angel quit?

Valentino: NO! He didn't fucking quit! It's worse! [takes Vox's phone] He MOVED!!!

[As he says that, he tosses Vox's phone to the wall making it shatter in half.]

Valentino: He thinks he can just walk in here, work, and then go home somewhere else? Can you FUCKING believe that?! *walks to closet* He thinks he can run off and shack up with Lucifer's bimbo daughter!

Vox: Angel is... living with Lucifer's daughter now?

Valentino: YEAH! That BITCH Chuckie or Chandler, or I dunno- Something mannish like that, she's got this hotel and‚Äî

[As he speaks, he opens the closet full of guns, drugs, and pictures including a poster of himself. Valentino brings up two long pistol guns: a long revolver and a semi-pistol.]

Valentino: [in a more relaxed tone] Which of these makes me look sexier? *turns to closet*

Vox: Heh. What are you doing, Val? You're not going over there.

[As he speaks, his left eye changes to show his simmering anger, but Valentino is busy loading his guns.]

Valentino: That slippery twink is gonna remember who owns him. I'm gonna FUCK everyone in that rancid shit hole, I swear to god!

[Before he finishes, Vox grabs him by the collar and shoves him to his face, clearly furious while Valentino has a shocked expression]

Vox: *distorted* VAL. *calms down* Hehe. Think about it.

[Vox then walks Valentino towards the window, taking away one of his guns and putting it in his pocket.]

Vox: Our brand is perfection. And what do you think chasing whores around town will do for our image?

Valentino: Um...fuck it up?

[A stereotypical 'winning' ding is played]

Vox: Right! Do you want people thinking you can't control your employees?

Valentino: No!

Vox: Exactly! And hey, you still have him under contract. He isn't going anywhere! Sooo...you should...

Valentino: Do nothing?

[A sound like winning at a casino is played]

Vox: Great idea! Now that's why they pay you the *pinches cheek* big bucks.

Valentino: Ugh, but I really wanted to shoot someone!

[As he speaks, Valentino gets a cigarette holder, and Vox lights it with his electricity powers.]

Vox: Well, lemme call up the lowest earners this month. *walks to TVs*

Valentino: Ohh, you know me too well. *chuckles and blows smoke* Ya know... Angel isn't the only one spending time at this ratty hotel with the devil's princesa.

Vox: Oh, who else is there? Someone who owes you money?

Valentino: *Chuckles* Someone who owes us much more than money... The Radio Demon is there.

[Upon hearing those words, electricity courses through Vox's head, and he scratches the desk so hard it leaves scratch marks. Vox made small ominous chuckles before turning to Valentino, two red lines appear on the left side of his lower lip.]

Vox: (distorted) What did you just say?

Valentino: You heard me.

Vox: Alastor...*walks to him* came back...and he is with Lucifer's *glitches* daughter, and that wasn't the *grabs him by the collar* FIRST FUCKING THING YOU TOLD ME?!?!?!

Valentino: *frees himself from grip* Hey! killing Alastor is your kink.

[As he speaks, he walks to the desk and turns on the monitor. Vox teleports to the center screen, which is a recording from a VoxTek Voyeur scope high in the sky. The scene, from a drone point of view, showing Alastor using his powers to attack Sir Pentious zeppelin, laughing maniacally as he hears Pentious screaming.]

Sir Pentious: Arrgh! Oh! Please! Stop!

Charlie: Um...Alastor? I think he's had enough.

Angel Dust: Nah. He's got a few more hits in him.

[Sir Pentious falls from the zeppelin in front of Alastor, face first on the ground. Alastor twirls his staff.]

Alastor: Thanks for another forgettable experience.

[An Egg Boi falls and breaks into pieces in front of Charlie.]

Sir Pentious: Thank you... for letting your guard down!

[Using his tail, he grabs a bit of Alastor's suit.]

Sir Pentious: Aha! Yah! Oh, shit...

[Sir Pentious looks up to see Alastor's shadow transform in front of him and Alastor apparently makes an elk bugle. The next shot shows a massive green explosion as Sir Pentious is seen flying off to the city screaming as he disappears from sight.]

Alastor: Well, it looks as though I need a visit to the tailor! Best of luck, chums.

Vaggie: Wait, you're leaving?! Alastor! We need your help! We need you to do your job.

Angel Dust: (gestures to the hole on the wall) We need a wall.

Alastor: Of course! Can't let my new project fall into disrepair already. What would the papers say?!

[With a snap of his fingers, black ink demons appear with construction tools as Alastor walks away. Angel takes an interest and looks at one of the larger muscular demons, shoving Vaggie away as he walks up to him.]

Angel Dust: *giggles* Hey, sweet cheeks. Whatcha doin' later? I love me a man with a giant... tool.

[The screen zooms out to reveal Valentino scowling at the current events, leaning his face against the screen.]

Valentino: See?! Look how he flirts with that guy, and he's not even paying! Who is that? I'm gonna fucking kill his whole fucking family! Vox? (slams his fist on the table) VOX!

[Vox was paying little attention, as his left pupil turns into a tilde as he eyes Alastor leaving, his appearance static and out of focus as the screen becomes a bit static.]

Vox: [glitches] That FUCKER is back!

[Valentino grins as he realizes the situation and walks to him.]

Valentino: Yeah, I thought he was gone for good too.

Vox: It's been seven years!

[Valentino leans up to him and pinches his cheek, Vox clearly pissed to care.]

Valentino: You still pissed that he almost beat you that time?

Vox: Uh, FUCK YOU.

Valentino: Just saying. *walks around him*

Vox: Things have changed a lot since he left town!

Valentino: That's for sure.

Vox: I gotta send a message of who's REALLY in charge of things now!

[Vox's face fills the screen as Valentino laughs in the background. The next shot shows Vox grinning as he marches to his chair.]

Vox: ‚ô´ Welcome home! ‚ô´

‚ô´ I'm gonna make you wish that you stayed gone! ‚ô´

[As Vox sings, electricity courses through his arm as he sits on his chair, and turns to face the numerous screens.]

Vox: ‚ô´ Say hello to a new status quo, ‚ô´

[Vox presses a big red button, and 4 cords latch themselves to the ports on the back of his head, connecting himself to his TV networks.]

Vox: ‚ô´ Everyone knows that there's a brand-new dawn, turn the TV on! ‚ô´

Director: Camera, speeds, rolling in three, two...

Chorus: ‚ô´ Wel-come to the show! ‚ô´

Vox: ‚ô´ Top of the hour and we're discussing a certain has-been who has been spotted cavorting around town after a seven-year absence, ‚ô´

‚ô´ Did anybody miss him, did anybody notice? ‚ô´

‚ô´ More on tonight's program. ‚ô´

‚ô´ So, the Radio Demon is back in town! ‚ô´

‚ô´ Why is he hanging around? ‚ô´

‚ô´ What does that mean for your family? ‚ô´

‚ô´ Well, handily, I've got good news! ‚ô´

‚ô´ He's a loser, a fossil, and I don't mean to sound hostile, ‚ô´

Vox & Chorus: ‚ô´ But the demon is a coward! ‚ô´

Vox: ‚ô´ You can take that as gospel. ‚ô´

‚ô´ Pulling my viewers? Impossible! ‚ô´

‚ô´ I'm visual, he's barely audible! ‚ô´

‚ô´ Stop giving him the time of day! ‚ô´

‚ô´ Don't listen to a word he'd say. ‚ô´

‚ô´ I hope he had a nice vacay! ‚ô´

Vox & Chorus: ‚ô´ But he should have stayed away! ‚ô´

[Cut to Alastor who had just finished getting his coat tailored. He notices the crowd watching the advertisement of Vox. He smiles and walks away with an idea. as Vox continues singing.]

Vox: ‚ô´ While he hid in radio, we pivoted to video! [pulls out an uncooked bloodied deer head from an oven caked in blood] Now his medium is getting bloody rare! ‚ô´

[In a hallway in V Tower, Vox jumps, twirls and then pulls Valentino and Velvette towards him]

‚ô´ Hell's been better since he split, ‚ô´

‚ô´ Where's he been? ‚ô´

‚ô´ Who gives a shit?! ‚ô´

[Cuts to Alastor making his reappearance, as he starts his radio broadcast from a radio station attached to the top corner of the Hazbin Hotel.]

Alastor: ‚ô´ Salutations! ‚ô´

‚ô´ Good to be back on the air. ‚ô´

‚ô´ Yes, I know it's been a while since someone with style treated Hell to a broadcast. ‚ô´

‚ô´ Sinners rejoice! ‚ô´

Vox: ‚ô´ What a dated voice! ‚ô´

Alastor: ‚ô´ Instead of a clout chasing mediocre video podcast. ‚ô´

Vox: COME ON!

Alastor: ‚ô´ Is Vox insecure, pursuing allure? ‚ô´

‚ô´ Flitting between this fad and that. ‚ô´

‚ô´ Is nothing working? ‚ô´

Vox: IGNORE HIS CHIRPING!

Alastor: ‚ô´ Every day he's got a new format! ‚ô´

Vox: YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE!

Vox & Chorus: ‚ô´ He's the shit that comes before that! ‚ô´

Alastor: ‚ô´ Is Vox as strong as he purports? ‚ô´

‚ô´ Or is it based on his support? ‚ô´

‚ô´ He'd be powerless without the other Vees! ‚ô´

Vox: Oh, PLEASE.

Alastor: ‚ô´ And here's the sugar on the cream. ‚ô´

‚ô´ He asked me to join his team! ‚ô´

Vox: Hold on!

Alastor: ‚ô´ I said no, and now he's pissy! That's the tea. ‚ô´

[As Alastor continues with his radio broadcast, Vox gets so pissed that his screen face starts to glitch and crash as he gets angrier.]

Vox: [Glitches.] ‚ô´ You oold timey PRICK! I'll show y-you suffering! ‚ô´

Alastor: ‚ô´ Uh oh, the TV is buffering! ‚ô´

[Vox couldn't handle his anger, causing him to overload his circuits with static electricity.]

Vox: [Signal breaking up.] ‚ô´ I'LL DESTROY YOOOOU-YOU LIT-T-LE‚Äî‚ô´

[Vox's screen face and voice overloads and crashes, before Vox involuntarily lets out an outburst that overloads everything from the TV screens to Valentino and Velvette's phone to everywhere in Pentagram City, causing a citywide blackout with the exception of the Hazbin Hotel.]

Alastor: ‚ô´ I'm afraid you've lost your signal. ‚ô´

[the camera zooms in on the hotel, and then zooms into Alastor's radio station]

‚ô´ Let's begin. ‚ô´

[Alastor slowly turns into his true demon form with every sentence.]

‚ô´ I'm gonna make you wish that I stayed gone! ‚ô´

[Alastor puts down his staff for the first time in the series]

‚ô´ Tune on in. ‚ô´

‚ô´ When I'm done, your status quo will know it's race is run! ‚ô´

‚ô´ Oh, this will be fun! ‚ô´

[Alastor makes one last evil laugh before cutting off Vox's signal throughout the city, leaving the Overlord dismayed that Alastor is still as popular and powerful as he was last time.]

Vox: FUU-UU-UCK!

[The scene cuts to the emergency meeting with Vox, Velvette, and Valentino to discuss a matter with Alastor as a Robo Fizz, Kitty, pass out drinks to each of them.]

Vox: We have a problem. Alastor is getting close to little princess Morningstar, so our main concern now is ensuring that no deal is ever struck between Lucifer's *slams the table* BRAT and that smiling freak!

Velvette: Well, how exactly are we supposed to stop it?

[Valentino was putting so much glue on his revolver to decorate with glitter and marbles.]

Valentino: Put something inside them. That's how I get the bitches to behave.

Vox: Well, maybe someone on the inside isn't such a bad idea. Do you think Angel would?

Valentino: That lanky prick won't even return my calls.

Vox: We need someone who Little Miss Bleeding Heart would take in.

Velvette: Someone...pathetic, desperate, with no direct ties to us?

Valentino: I employ every down on their luck loser this side of Hell. Who the fuck is left?

Vox: [Scoffs.] I think, I have... JUST the one.

[As Vox slowly turns around, the sharks in the shark tank swim up to his shoulders, his right-hypnotic eye gleaming with a sinister grin for a plan he has in store.]

[Back at the hotel, Alastor's black and white demons are currently fixing the hole in the wall as Charlie and Vaggie returns. Charlie throws herself onto a couch, exhausted.]

Angel Dust: Soooo? How'd it go?

Vaggie: [Sighs.] Not a single new recruit.

Angel Dust: Yeah well, who would wanna use their last days not fucking and fighting?

[As Angel checks his phone, Vaggie hears a knock on the front door. She walks over to it and opens the door, only to find Sir Pentious behind it, holding his hat.]

Sir Pentious: Why, hello my dear‚Äî

[Sir Pentious is cut off by Vaggie punching him in the face. He falls when Vaggie brought out her spear at him. Sir Pentious cowers in fear with the tip barely at his neck, and held a peace sign gesture.]

Sir Pentious: Wait, wait, wait! I come in peace. [the 's' sound in 'peace is drawn out, in mimicry of a snake]

Vaggie: What are you doing here?

[Charlie appears behind Vaggie.]

Charlie Morningstar: Vaggie, what's the problem? [gasps] Oh! Hello again!

Sir Pentious: I didn't come looking for a fight. I uhh... I heard that you're helping people, people who want to be better?

[Charlie lets out another gasp and runs over to grab his hand and lead him to the door of the hotel.]

Charlie Morningstar: You heard right! Welcome to our home of healing, our resort of restoration, our-

[Angel Dust appears from the door and cuts off Charlie.]

Angel Dust: Are you fucking nuts? This chump was trying to kill us like literally 6 hours ago! And now you wanna bring him in here to live with us?

Charlie Morningstar: Absolutely! This place is about second chances, and who deserves one more than this slithery... slippery... special little man!

Angel Dust: (To Vaggie) Aren't you supposed to protect this place?

[Charlie gives her puppy-dog eyes, begging Vaggie to give Sir Pentious a chance to live in the hotel. Vaggie gives in.]

Vaggie: *Sighs* I guess he's not much of a threat without the war machine, (Sir Pentious' cobra head lifts with anticipation) or even with the war machine. (Sir Pentious' cobra head flaps down with depression, sighing)

[Charlie was so happy that she hugs Vaggie, lifting her up in the process and twirling around once.]

Charlie Morningstar: Oh! Thank you thank you thank you thank you! Sir Pentious! Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel!

[Charlie leads Sir Pentious to the door inside of the hotel.]

Sir Pentious: Oh no darling! Thank you! You won't regret this.

[Angel follows soon afterwards.]

Angel Dust: Eh, I give you a week, tops.

[Charlie gives Sir Pentious the tour of the hotel, introducing Husk to him, the wall he blow up before it was fixed.]

Charlie Morningstar: So, this is the bar and the bartender. This is the curtain, and this is the new wall after you broke the last one, heh, and oh! Oh! This is the-

[Vaggie grabs Charlie to calm her down again.]

Vaggie: Babe, you don't have to show him every detail.

Charlie Morningstar: Sorry, I'm just so excited to have our first real guest!

Angel Dust: Uh, what the hell am I then?

Charlie Morningstar: Well, you're an important part of our family here Angel, but you uhm, uh...

Vaggie: Constantly make us look bad, sexually harass the staff, and have literally never once tried to improve?

Charlie Morningstar: What she means is, it's just nice to have someone interested for once.

[As Charlie walks back to Sir Pentious, Angel Dust looks downtrodden, likely feeling sad about Vaggie's comments and Charlie's unintentional dismissal of him.]

[Niffty is seen playing playing with KeeKee with a string when Charlie and Sir Pentious approach. KeeKee hisses at the sight of Sir Pentious and scatters away while Niffty turns to meet him.]

Charlie Morningstar: Over here we have our maid Niffty.

Niffty: *Gasps* The bad boy is back!

[Niffty gets up on Sir Pentious and holds his collars, looking at him with insanity in her red eye and a very sadistic smile, which creeps out Sir Pentious.]

Niffty: (creepy whisper) Never leave me again.

Charlie Morningstar: We're about 80% sure she's harmless, and over here we have- (nearly bumps into Alastor) Oh! Uh, Alastor! Our gracious facility manager! You've met our newest guest Sir Pentious...hehe...

Alastor: Ah yes! You're the one who ruined my coat!

[Alastor's eyes glow red in the dark with a violent temptation to rip him a part.]

Alastor: *in a sinisterly tone* I definitely remember you now.

[Sir Pentious gulps nervously.]

Charlie Morningstar: Well, I guess this is a great time for your first lesson! *Clears throat* ""How to apologize!"" The first step to becoming a better person is to admit when you are wrong, why don't you give it a try?

Sir Pentious: Yes...uhm... Mr uhm... Radio Demon sir, please forgive me for attacking you and ruining your very lovely coat... uhm... here.

[As a token of apology, Sir Pentious hands back the small fabric he tear from Alastor's coat. Alaster takes it and inspects the damage.]

Alastor: Ah-Ho! Not many people have been able to take even this much off me, it must have meant quite a lot to you.

[Despite being generous, Alastor spontaneously combusts the fabric tear into green flames, leaving Sir Pentious and Charlie stunned.]

[The scene cuts to a group gathering introducing Sir Pentious to the hotel.]

Charlie Morningstar: Now, with a new resident, I think it's important we all get to know each other! So we are going to play a little game. Everyone, follow me. My name is Charlie *claps twice* I like to sing! *claps twice* and when we get to know each other it's the greatest thing! *claps twice*

Sir Pentious: My name's Sir Pentious *claps twice* I like to build *claps twice* and despite my stupid Egg Boiz, I think I'm very skilled! *claps twice*

[When it was Angel's turn, he looked disinterested, looking up from his phone.]

Angel Dust: This is stupid.

Charlie Morningstar: This- is not- stupid! *claps twice* It's just a game! *claps twice* Sir Pentious did it well so now please try to do the same! *claps twice*

Angel Dust: I am too sober for this.

Vaggie: Well, get used to it and learn how to play, this is gonna be your whole day! *claps twice*

[The next scene cuts to a act with Angel Dust wearing a trench coat and a hat as he reads a script. Sir Pentious is also acting as a innocent child wearing a sailor suit, licking a comically large lollipop.]

Angel Dust: ""Oh, I'm a bad man on the streets who never got enough hugs, now, where's an innocent kid I can sell crack to?"" Wow, who wrote this?

Charlie Morningstar: It's great right? Keep going!

Angel Dust: ""Hey you.""

Sir Pentious: ""Who, me?""

Angel Dust: ""Yeah, you look like a kid who could use some... devil's dandruff??"" Oh, for fuck's sake.

Sir Pentious: ""Not me! I have to go home and study!""

Angel Dust: ""Come on kid, it'll make you cool like me... the crackhead.""

Sir Pentious: ""The only cool thing here is to say no to drugs! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to not have sexual intercourse before marriage!""

[triumphant trumpet sting]

Charlie Morningstar: *stands up and claps* Yes! Oh bravo! Bravo! *chuckles* wow Pentious! At this rate, you'll be redeemed in no time.

Angel Dust: I... I'm going to bed.

[As Angel heads back up to his room, he overhears Charlie congratulating Sir Pentious. Looking back at them, he looks sad.]

Charlie Morningstar: I am so proud of you Sir Pentious! That was amazing!

Sir Pentious: Thank you! Thank you! You like me! You really like me!

[In Angel's room, Fat Nuggets is asleep on his bed slightly snoring until Angel accidentally throws his coat on top of him. Fat Nuggets grunts and crawls out of the coat, as he watches Angel lie down on his bed. Angel glumly looks at his phone and sees all his voice mails from Valentino. Angel sighs and begins to play them. Valentino's voice mails switch back and forth between a friendly, apologetic tone and a barrage of screams threatening violence.] Valentino (voice message):

Angel baby, come home! It's not the same without you here, I miss you! Come back-

ANGEL, YOU BITCH! IF YOU DON'T COME HOME, YOU'LL BE FUCKING GREASY TRUCKERS FOR THE NEXT YEAR-

Hey, amorcito, I didn't mean to yell, but you know how crazy you make me-

YOU FUCKING SLUT!

Hey, Angie! About earlier-

-KILL YOUR WHOLE FUCKIN' FAMILY!

Work's really stressful!

-LITTLE COCKSUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

Valentino (disembodied voice): *dead serious* You actually think you can change?

[Red smoke appears from seemingly nowhere, and circles around Angel until Valentino stops talking, ending with the smoke clinging around his neck and chin like hands before fading away.]

Valentino (disembodied voice): Addict trash like you doesn't change. I'll see you soon, baby.

[Angel sighs as Fat Nuggets gets on the bed next to him. Angel gently rubs his head and back.]

Angel Dust: ...Sorry, not now, Fat Nuggets.

[Angel gets up and leaves his room with Fat Nuggets looking worried. Angel goes to Husk's bar, picks up a whole bottle, and starts drinking alcohol. Out of the corner of his eye, he notices something slithering away. He follows, finding Charlie's office door opened, and takes a peek inside. There, he discovers that Sir Pentious is setting up a small camera in one of the bookshelves, a camera that belong to Vox. Angel realizes what he's been doing and slams the door open.]

Angel Dust: You slippery little shit!

Sir Pentious: *yelps*

Angel Dust: You're working for the Vees? I fucking knew there was something shitty about you.

Sir Pentious: I don't know what you're talking about!...whore bug!

[Angel, sufficiently angered, tackles Sir Pentious on the ground. He punches him in the face before wrestling with him.]

Sir Pentious: Get your aggressively average body...OFF OF ME!

[Sir Pentious' eyes spiral hypnotic powers to him. Angel becomes momentarily hypnotized.]

Angel Dust: Fuck!

[Angel backs away. He then quickly snaps out of it. He now has Sir Pentious cornered. Right then, Charlie and Vaggie woke up after hearing the scuffle.]

Charlie Morningstar: *Yawns* What's going on?

Angel Dust: This little bitch is a traitor!

Sir Pentious: Preposterous! I would never betray you. You... are my best friends!

[Sir Pentious hugs both girls.]

Angel Dust: Uh huh, then explain this!

[Angel lifts off one of the books to reveal a camera, much to Charlie's shock. Sir Pentious realizes that his cover is blown and scurries away. He brings out his wrist watch to make contact with Vox.]

Sir Pentious: Ah! Ah! Abort! Abort! S.O.S! Agent Pentious in need of immediate evacuation!

[Vox immediately picks up.]

Vox: Pentious? Wait... you were caught?!? It hasn't even been, a day!

Sir Pentious: Please! You've got to get me out of here!

Vox: I can't believe we thought you could handle even something this simple! Do us a favour; if they don't kill you, go ahead and DO IT YOURSELF, you miserable failure!

Sir Pentious: [crying] I... I... Just make it quick I guess... Not that I deserve it.

[Sir Pentious lies on the ground, with Vaggie holding a spear ready to pierce the skull.]

Vaggie: Gladly.

[Right before Vaggie can put him out of misery, Charlie stops her, and starts singing ""It Starts With Sorry"" ]

Charlie Morningstar: Wait! ...Pentious?

[Charlie extends her hand towards Pentious]

‚ô´ It starts with sorry, that's your foot in the door. ‚ô´

‚ô´ One simple sorry, spoken straight from your core. ‚ô´

‚ô´ The path to forgiveness, is a twisting trail of hearts! ‚ô´

‚ô´ But sorry is where it starts! ‚ô´

Sir Pentious: ‚ô´ Who could forgive a dirtbag like me? ‚ô´

‚ô´ I don't deserve your amnesty. ‚ô´

[Angel walks into frame with dual Tommy submachine guns in both hands with Vaggie tailing behind, holding her spear.]

Angel Dust and Vaggie: ‚ô´ Can't we just kill him? ‚ô´

‚ô´ Shoot him and spill his blood? ‚ô´

Charlie Morningstar: ‚ô´ That's an option you could choose. ‚ô´

Angel Dust and Vaggie: ‚ô´ Works for us. ‚ô´

Charlie Morningstar: ‚ô´ But who hasn't been in his shoes? It starts with sorry. ‚ô´

Sir Pentious: ‚ô´ Sorry. ‚ô´

Charlie Morningstar: ‚ô´ Dig down deeper and say one sincere sorry! ‚ô´

Sir Pentious: ‚ô´ I'm so sorry! ‚ô´

Charlie Morningstar: ‚ô´ And your journey's underway! ‚ô´

Charlie Morningstar and Sir Pentious: ‚ô´ It'll take time to cover your/my vast multitude of sins ‚ô´

‚ô´ But sorry is where it begins. It starts with sorry. ‚ô´

[As the song ends, Niffty is seen standing in the hallway in her bedwear, disappointed.]

Niffty: I hated that song! Why are you so lame?! *kicks Pentious' tail 'eyes' and walks away* Not a bad boy.

Charlie Morningstar: *Happily sighs* Good first day! Let's get some rest!

[As Charlie and the others leave with a wrist watch communicator still left in the office, Alastor appears from the shadow of the dark hallway with a malevolent smile. He comes and picks up the watch before contacting Vox on the watch.]

Vox: WHAT?!?

[Vox pauses when he realizes that Alastor is the one calling him, showing fear in his screen face as Alastor laughs.]

Alastor: You'll have to try harder than that next time, ol' pal!

[Alastor crushes the watch with his bare hand as Vox incoherently rages at him as the watch becomes incapable of creating audio, before Alastor retreats back into the darkness, chuckling, as the episode ends.]",4,1758242886.0,hazbin,3,1.0,False

1nkpf3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nkpf3v/whats_the_key_difference_between_electric_kettles/,What's the key difference between electric kettles?,"Hey everyone! I've been using electric kettles for years, and I've noticed a lot of confusion when people try to choose between different models. After trying out various types and doing extensive research, I thought I'd share what I've learned about these time-saving kitchen appliances.

The main differences between electric kettles come down to several key factors. First, there's the heating element type. Some kettles use exposed elements (those visible coils at the bottom), while others have concealed elements. I personally prefer concealed elements because they're easier to clean and tend to last longer.

Temperature control is another huge factor. Basic models just bring water to a boil, but advanced kettles let you set specific temperatures. This is super important if you're into different types of tea or pour-over coffee. Green tea, for example, tastes better at around 175¬∞F, while black tea needs hotter water.

After trying countless models, I found some great options on this page: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They have detailed comparisons that really helped me understand what I needed.

Material is crucial too. Glass kettles look amazing and let you see the water level clearly, but they're more fragile. Stainless steel ones are practically indestructible but can be a bit pricier. Plastic ones are budget-friendly but might affect taste and don't last as long.

Capacity is something people often overlook. Most kettles range from 1-2 liters. If you're just making tea for yourself, a smaller one is fine. But if you're like me and have a family of tea drinkers, you'll want something bigger.

Speaking of features, auto-shutoff is non-negotiable for safety. Keep-warm functions are nice but use more electricity. Some models even have built-in filters for hard water areas.

The price range is pretty wide - you can spend anywhere from $20 to $200. After trying both ends of the spectrum, I'd say the sweet spot is around $40-80 for a good quality kettle that'll last years. You can check out some well-priced options here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

Noise level varies too. Cheaper kettles tend to be louder, while higher-end models often have quiet boil technology. This matters if you're making tea early morning while others are sleeping!

One thing I learned the hard way - wattage matters. Higher wattage (around 1500W) means faster boiling times. I used to have a 1000W kettle, and the extra minute or two of waiting every time really adds up.

The warranty is worth considering too. Some brands offer just 1 year, while others give you 2-3 years of coverage. This usually reflects their confidence in their product's durability.

Hope this helps clear up some confusion! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features - I'm always happy to help fellow tea and coffee enthusiasts!",1,1758242636.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nkpf14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nkpf14/long_haus_of_gloi_review_from_a_perfume_newb/,Long Haus of Gloi Review from a Perfume Newb (Hauswarming Box),"I love reading people's reviews and their thoughts on different scents, so I thought I'd start posting mine as I work through samples! 

**Background:** I'm a complete newbie to perfumes in general. All my life I've been very sensitive to scented products and most give me headaches, including every mainstream alcohol based perfume I've sampled. On a whim, I decided to try a few indie samples of Firebird's oil perfumes since they were affordable. Lo and behold, I did not get a headache!!! I'm still sampling those but I have ~~gone batshit~~ ordered many samples now that the world of perfume has been opened up to me. Unfortunately as a newb, I don't know what a lot of things are *supposed* to smell like.

Anyway, to the review! 

**Purchased:** Hauswarming Box. This includes unscented 2oz pumpkin butter, unscented 2oz body emulsion, unscented 2oz bubbling sugar scrub, 4 general catalog perfume samples of your choice, and free shipping, all for $15. Perfect if you're new to them or for gifting. The scents I picked were Imp, Vice, Odette, and Mango Sticky Rice. A sample of Cozy Apple was included for free! 

**Listed TAT:** ? couldn't find any listed TAT on their site

**Actual TAT:** Ordered on a Saturday, was shipped the following Thursday. So 4 business days. 

**Customer Service:** Didn't need to interact with them, so N/A. They did include a free sample and candy, as well as shipped quickly, though!

--

**Pumpkin Butter:** A little thicker and more moisturizing/emollient than the emulsion. It does leave a bit of a greasy film on my skin, but it doesn't stick to my clothing so I'm fine with it. My skin is notorious for not wanting to absorb products, so I can't fault the pumpkin butter too much. The pumpkin butter left my skin noticably softer the next day. TBH, I'd probably be able to review this better in winter when the air is super dry. Overall it's pleasant and I look forward to testing more in later fall/winter.

**Body Emulsion:** This is a lighter moisturizer compared to the pumpkin butter. I slapped one product on one leg and one product on the other to test. The leg with the body emulsion was less soft/less moisturized than the one with the pumpkin butter, but did not have a greasy film. It says *body* emulsion, but I also slapped some on my face to see what would happen. I have an oily T-zone that's also dehydrated/flaky atm. I've been trying various Korean skincare products to help with this and nothing I've tried so far as made much of a difference. You know what made a huge difference? This emulsion. The flakiness I've been experiencing for quite some time was nearly gone overnight. I was honestly shocked! It's too heavy to slather on my entire face, but just on the T-zone?? Wonderful. I only use it this way at night because it does leave some film on my face, which I wash off in the morning before applying my daily moisturizer. I am curious to see if continued use will clog my pores or make my skin mad since this isn't meant for face use, but so far I'm lovin' it!

**Bubbling Scrub:** I haven't used too many scrubs in my life (I usually use one of those Korean exfoliating mitts), but of the ones I've used, I like this one a lot! It leaves my skin feeling softer and more moisturized than the Tree Hut one I have. I used the bubbling sugar scrub on my legs before shaving/as a shaving cream because it does lather somewhat and leaves a film on your skin. I felt like I got a really good shave and my legs felt soft after. I did maybe get some bumps around my knees, but I'm not sure if that was my razor's fault or the scrub. The bumps went away quickly regardless of their origin, though.

--

**Perfume Oil Testing Method:** I let all perfume oils rest for two weeks. They were applied to moisturized wrists before bed and I tested one per night. I don't like subjecting anyone else in my household to my perfume experiments and I like seeing how much scent is left when I wake up. This does mean I may miss some scent development, but if I like the perfume enough, I will do a day time test.

**Mango Sticky Rice** - *sweet mango, coconut infused rice and toasted sesame*

The different parts of this scent felt like they were at odds with one another. The mango felt fresh, maybe a little green or underripe, while the rice & sesame have a more warm and toasty scent. To me they didn't play as well together as they could have if the mango was a ripe, sweeter mango. The slight greenness, in addition to the subtle coconut, gave an almost a soapy or lotiony scent. It feels like a scent meant more for bath & body than perfume. I do quite like the rice/sesame scent, but overall it's just ok. 
**2.5/5**

**Odette** - *clean sun dried linens, tuberose, ginger lily and white musk*

I was most skeptical about this one since florals often give me headaches, both scented products and actual flowers. But I had a tuberose incense from Japan that I *loved*, so I decided to give it a go. Hark! No headaches from this!! Oils are truly feeling like a miracle to me. Perhaps I'm allergic to perfumer's alcohol. Anyway, this feels like a more stereotypical/more mainstream feminine scent. It's too girly floral for me personally. I just get white florals, I don't get any of the linen. Or maybe I just don't know what 'linen' smells like in the context of perfume <_<; After a while, this morphs into floral liquid hand soap scent on me. I could see this being a good bath & body scent for someone who likes this type of scent profile.
**1.5/5**

**Vice** - *steam billows rolling off a vessel of fresh made Turkish coffee, marshmallow goo tainted by graham cracker crumbs, toasted hazelnuts and blanketed in black chocolate*

I had Coffee Haus in my cart instead until I realized *wait*, this is basically a coffee s'mores scent. I *love* s'mores flavored stuff and had to pick Vice. Both in the bottle and wet on my skin this had a rather unpleasant, sharp amaretto scent. Not sure where that was coming from. Thankfully it dissipated quickly and left the coffee s'mores scent. However, this is a s'mores flavored Keurig coffee pod, not a rich dark chocolate s'mores latte made by a barista in a nice cafe. It dries down to a warm/nutty cocoa powder (the cheaper kind, not the nice Dutch process kind) & coffee scent. I think I'd like this better as a lotion, but I'm too hesitant of that sharp amaretto and I think there are probably better coffee/s'mores scents out there.
**2.5/5**

**Imp** - *peculiar passion fruit mingling with sun cured apricots, perfectly pink grapefruit juice and innocent whispers of wet mimosa blooms*

When I sniffed this in the tube, I thought *Yeah, that's the stuff. This will be my favorite of the batch.* Dear reader, it was not. I did not like this. It was giving such lovely tart pink grapefruit when wet, and I love grapefruit. Once dry, I got sweet apricot that's tempered a little by the more tart passion fruit and grapefruit. They keep it from being cloying, but it's still very sweet. I don't know what mimosa smells like, but the wet blooms add a soapy floral to this. It reads a little more immature on me than I'd prefer. The longer I wore this, the more it turned into 'generic floral liquid hand soap in the work bathroom.' The longer I wore this, the more I disliked it. This one also feels like a bath & body scent, not a perfume. 
**1.5/5**

**Cozy Apple** - *Cozy Sweater (pale skin musk, faded perfume, egyptian amber, softly burning nag champa, aged vanilla), crisp apple*

Free sample! This is not one I would have picked for myself and I suspected I would not like this. This gave 'the local thrift store that uses apple air freshener to help hide the musty clothes smell' and dried down to 'thrifted wool blend sweater that wasn't washed before being donated and still smells like the previous owner's perfume.' The crisp apple felt cheap and artificial, but the majority of the apple thankfully faded quickly. This left what I imagine must be the Cozy Sweater scent, plus a little lingering green soapiness from the apple. That said, I liked the Cozy Sweater dry down more than I anticipated I would, but it does really feel like a 'me' scent. I can see how other people would like that part of it.
**2/5**

**Final Thoughts:** While it may seem like I wasn't very stoked about the perfumes, I actually had a lot of fun trying them. The thing is, they feel like they're meant for bath & body. This makes complete sense because Haus of Gloi seems to excel at their B&B products. It makes even more sense where their general catalog is concerned. I'd like to sample more of their scents/seasonal scents, especially as B&B products. Their B&B products have been great so far! I definitely plan to continue using them. Haus of Gloi is also a great value and incredibly accessible to a newbie thanks to the Hauswarming Box. Especially with the generous free sample, little note, and candy! 100/10 for offering the box, it's perfect. I look forward to exploring Haus of Gloi more!

""That's not true. That's not what happened at all.""

""And then this‚Äîthis envelope."" I gestured to it, still sitting between us like a mocking reminder. ""What is this, Thomas? What is this supposed to be?"" My voice was trembling now. ""You leave me an envelope of cash like some ... like a bimbo? Like I'm some kind of transaction you can just pay off when you screw up?""

His face flickered with shock, but then, almost immediately, he hardened. ""Oh God, you're exaggerating,"" he said, as if he couldn't understand how deeply it cut. ""It's just cash, October. I didn't have time to get anything else. I'll get you the gift I promised. I just didn't think it would be that big of a deal.""

Thomas has always had a controlled and workaholic nature. I used to love that about him. The way he carried himself‚Äîalways composed, always prepared, always thinking three steps ahead. Thomas was the kind of man who made lists for vacations, who color-coded his calendar, who ran the family company like it was an extension of his bloodstream. He was disciplined. Stoic. Unshakable.

And once, I thought that made me safe. That same discipline, that commitment, that ambition‚ÄîI used to admire it. I thought it meant he was building a future for us. But now ... now it feels like all of him belongs to that company. To his plans. His image. His father's expectations.

And to Laura.

Not to me.

I walked into the building with my baby in my arms, a fire simmering under my skin. I must've looked like a storm in soft clothes, because people glanced at me, then quickly looked away.

His assistant smiled when she saw me‚Äîtight-lipped, like I was interrupting something sacred.

""He's in a meeting,"" she said.

""I'll wait.""

Then came the voice. Her voice.

Laura.

""Oh‚ÄîOctober,"" she said, blinking like she couldn't quite believe I had the audacity to show up. ""Or is it November? I always get it mixed up.""

My jaw clenched. ""It's October.""

She gave me a practiced smile. ""Right. Creative, I guess.""

""I'm here to see my husband.""

She tilted her head. ""If he was expecting you, I'm sure he would've told me. He's in with the regional team. Very important meeting.""

And yet, somehow, when the baby let out a soft cry, Thomas appeared almost instantly.

The second he saw me, his face shifted, confused and concerned

""October? What's wrong? Is the baby okay?""

""We need to talk.""

His eyes flicked to the conference room, then back to me. ""Now? I have‚Äî""

""Now.""

He sighed like I was another problem to be solved, another unexpected variable in a day full of carefully managed chaos. Then he opened the door to his office and waved me in. I stepped past Laura. She didn't move. She didn't need to. Inside, I placed the carrier on the couch. My hands didn't shake, but something deep inside me did. I pulled the envelope from my bag and dropped it onto his desk, watching him flinch like it was a bomb about to go off.

He glanced at it, confused. ""What is that?""

""You tell me,"" I shot back, trying to keep my voice steady.

He opened it, his face changing in a flash from confusion to frustration as he saw what it was. ""It's cash. Until your real gift comes in. I told you I'd get you something special.""

I could feel the heat in my chest, the sting in my throat. ""You mean after you skipped out on my birthday and ran off to look for Laura's cat?""

He froze. ""That's not fair,"" he snapped, his voice rising a little. ""It was a lost animal. She was upset. We didn't expect it to take so long. I was just helping her out.""

""It was my birthday, Thomas,"" I ground out, my voice barely holding together.

He shifted uncomfortably, his jaw tightening. ""I was going to surprise you, okay? With the kids. We had it planned. And then‚Äî""

""You prioritized her.""

His eyes narrowed, frustration bubbling up like a pot on the verge of boiling over. ""That's not true. That's not what happened at all.""

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but it only made the pain worse. ""And then this‚Äîthis envelope."" I gestured to it, still sitting between us like a mocking reminder. ""What is this, Thomas? What is this supposed to be?"" My voice was trembling now. ""You leave me an envelope of cash like some ... like a bimbo? Like I'm some kind of transaction you can just pay off when you screw up?""

His face flickered with shock, but then, almost immediately, he hardened. ""Oh God, you're exaggerating,"" he said, as if he couldn't understand how deeply it cut. ""It's just cash, October. I didn't have time to get anything else. I'll get you the gift I promised. I just didn't think it would be that big of a deal.""

I felt like the air had been knocked out of me. How could he not see it? ""You didn't think it would be a big deal? You didn't think that a gesture like this would be insulting? That this‚Äî"" I looked at the envelope again, disgust crawling through me, ""‚Äîwasn't a real apology? That you're treating me like a chore? Like something you just throw money at when you don't feel like showing up? When did you stop caring? When did you stop caring about Your Wife instead of your workwife!""

His eyes flashed, his defenses slamming up like a wall between us. ""Workwife? What does that even mean? You think I don't care about you? You think I'm not doing all this‚Äîeverything‚Äîfor us? For the kids? You think I like this? I've got meetings, targets, deadlines, my father coming in today, and you waltz in here, throwing a tantrum, accusing me of being a bad husband? This is who I am, October!""

I stared at him, hurt flashing through me like lightning. ""I used to know who you were. I used to admire it‚Äîyour dedication, your ambition. But now..."" My voice faltered for a moment. ""Now, it's just a wall between us, and you know what? It's a wall that Laura has no problem climbing over."" His breath caught. He stared at me for a long moment, and then he sighed, like he was trying to calm himself down. ""Maybe you're just hormonal or tired. It's been a long week, okay?""

I recoiled, the words stinging like he'd slapped me across the face. ""Hormonal? Is that what you think this is?""

He didn't even seem to notice the way his words cut. ""We'll talk at home. Later. When you've calmed down. We're both just ... on edge."" He rubbed the back of his neck, looking frustrated. ""I don't have time for this right now. My father is coming in twenty minutes, and you're just being dramatic.""

I shook my head, the pressure of everything mounting until I couldn't breathe. ""You disappear on my birthday and goes to Laura and you think I'm just being dramatic?""

""October, I'm doing the best I can,"" he said, his voice softer now, but still defensive. ""She's just a coworker. There's nothing between us.""

I took a step back, the truth sinking in with sharp clarity. ""She's your priority,"" I said, my voice cracking. ""Something goes wrong in her life, and you drop everything. You're there for her."" He stared at me, disbelief written all over his face. There was a knock, and then‚Äîwithout waiting‚ÄîLaura entered again. Like she knew she could.

""I just thought I should let you know, people can hear,"" she said sweetly, eyes only for him. ""Might be best to finish this at home.""

He nodded. ""Thanks, Laura.""

And that was it.

Not we're in the middle of something.

Not please give us a moment.

Just thanks, Laura.

When the door shut, I stared at him. He shook his head. "" We will talk more at home. You can't just come to my job and make a scene.""

""I made a scene because you forgot me.""

""I didn't forget your birthday!""

""You forgot me.""

He slammed a hand against the desk. ""God, do you even hear yourself? This jealousy‚Äîthis obsession‚Äîit's exhausting! My father's coming any minute. I don't have time for your tantrum.""

""tantrum"" ... and in that moment, it hit me; he would always believe the problem was me. My hormones. My exhaustion. My expectations. My feelings. Never him. Never the woman he runs to. Never the choices he makes, over and over, to make her feel safe and seen, while I sit at home wondering what I did wrong.

I didn't say another word. I picked up the baby, kept my head high, and walked out the door, and I didn't look back. I drove to small park nearby and sat on a bench, the stroller beside me, my chest tight. My hands still shaking. I called his sister.

When she picked up, I could almost hear her smirk through the phone. ""What did my idiot brother do now?"" she asked, her voice carefree, a stark contrast to the heavy, suffocating air I was drowning in. I took a deep breath, trying to keep it together. ""I don't think he loves me.""

There was a long pause on the other end. I could hear her shuffling around, probably making herself a cup of coffee or cracking open a beer, just like she always did when she was in one of those carefree moods. She didn't have a care in the world, a fact that both irritated and fascinated me. But then, that was always her way. She was the wild one‚Äîthe one who never quite fit into the family.

Unlike Thomas and the rest of them, she didn't care about rules, status, or maintaining appearances. She'd left years ago, chosen to live on her own terms, living a nomadic life that took her from one place to the next. She'd traveled, explored, met people who actually saw her. She'd given up the comfort of her family's rigid world, choosing instead to live out of a backpack and chase after whatever called her in the moment. And, in doing so, she became the black sheep of the family.

Her decisions, her free-spirited ways, were a constant disappointment to her conservative, uptight parents. They saw her as reckless, childish, lost, and for a while, I had agreed with them. I tried to be the good daughter-in-law, the one who followed the path laid out for me, the one who worked hard to be accepted. But now? Now, I envied her.

She exhaled into the phone, her voice softer now. ""Oh, baby ... I'm sorry to hear that. But listen, do you want me to tell you the truth?""

I nodded, even though she couldn't see it. ""Yes.""

""The truth is ... we've all seen it for a long time, October. The way you've always been in love with him, the way you've tried to make it work, even when it was clear he wasn't fully there with you. I get it, I really do. You wanted him to love you the way you love him. But he's always been distant, hasn't he? Cold. Like he knew you loved him enough that it would be enough for both of you. Look, October, Thomas never left home, did he? Never made his own path. He stayed right there, in that suffocating world where ambition and appearances are everything. He's a perfect replica of our father. Cold, controlled, obsessed with the family business and duties.""

Her words stung, but I didn't interrupt her. I knew better than to argue, not now, not with the truth hanging between us like a thick fog.

""You've been choosing him over and over,"" she continued, her voice a steady rhythm of honesty. ""And it's time you start choosing yourself.""

Her words felt like a slap, but not one meant to hurt. No, this was the kind of slap that wakes you up, that knocks sense into you when you've been lost in the haze of your own denial for far too long.

""You're not doing this for you anymore,"" she said, her voice dropping just slightly, but enough for me to feel the gravity in it. ""You've got to do it for your kids, too. You've got to show them what it means to value yourself, to love yourself enough to walk away from someone who doesn't.""

I swallowed the lump in my throat, my hands trembling just a little as I gripped the phone tighter. I wasn't sure if I could keep going, keep listening to the painful truth she was handing me. But I had to. I needed to hear it.

She paused, then sighed, as if she were weighing her next words carefully. ""October, everyone knows how much you've loved him. It's been obvious to the whole world, but it is no longer enough, is it?""

I flinched, feeling the sting of her words pierce straight to my heart. I didn't want to admit it, didn't want to acknowledge how painfully true it was. But she was right. Everyone knew. They had always known. I had worn my love for him like a badge, quietly, proudly, even though it had never been returned in the same way. All those years, I had loved him with everything I had‚Äîmore than he had ever loved me, more than he had ever thought to give. I had wrapped my whole life around the idea of him, thinking that my loyalty, my sacrifices, my willingness to give up pieces of myself would somehow make him see me, make him appreciate me. But it had never been enough.

It was like I had been playing a one-sided game, pouring everything into someone who never bothered to meet me halfway. And I had been so blinded by my own love, by my own expectations, that I had failed to see how it was draining me, wearing me thin, until I was nothing more than a shadow of myself.

Her words hit me like a brick. And though they hurt, they were exactly what I needed to hear. My heart twisted in pain, but something inside me also cracked open. I didn't respond for a moment, and when I finally spoke, my voice was hoarse. ""I don't know how to let go.""

She was silent for a beat. ""You don't have to do it all at once, October. But you have to start somewhere. Stop choosing him. That's how you let go.""

The truth stung, but it was what I needed to hear. It was time ..

\-

He came home late. The door creaked softly open, and I didn't even turn my head. I kept the lights dim in our bedroom, half because the kids were asleep down the hall, half because I didn't want him to see the way my eyes still looked a little puffy.

He didn't say anything at first. Just quietly changed out of his work clothes, the soft rustle of fabric filling the silence between us. Then he slipped into bed beside me like nothing had fractured. Like I wasn't lying here, wide awake in a place where love used to feel simple.

He pecked the top of my head. Gently. Almost shyly.

""I'm sorry,"" he murmured into my hair. His voice was hoarse, like he hadn't spoken in hours. ""I hate when you're mad at me. You're barely ever mad ... so when you are, I‚ÄîI don't know what to say. I'm not good with words, but I'm trying.""

I stayed still. Let him speak. Let him explain himself in that soft, tired tone that used to melt me and now only made something ache deeper.

1nkpegv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nkpegv/balancing_effort_and_contributions_with_bf_25m_23f/,"Balancing Effort and Contributions with BF (25M, 23F)","tldr: my bf asked me to pay him back for a game he wanted to go to, and now im reevaluating everything

So I (23F) have been dating a guy (25M) for about 5 months now. We see each other about twice a week, and he's lovely. Very nice, super positive, and has great energy. However, something (probably minor) happened recently that really rubbed me the wrong way.

I want to preface this by saying that I do pay for, and believe in paying for dates--even as a woman. In my past relationships and even current frienships, there's always been a loose 'I got this, you get the next one' or 'I'll get the tickets, you buy drinks' sorta vibe. Not hard and fast, and unspoken, but that's the general idea. For example, I was seeing a guy 2-3 years ago and he drove down 2.5 hours to see me, so I bought dinner. That's the idea--just to paint a picture.

Anyway, this guy I'm seeing prefaced that he was incredibly cheap (verbatim) when he first met me. This might be my own fault, but at first I didn't think it would be an¬†*actual*¬†issue. After all, we're all going through tough times right now--rent is sky high, groceries are basically a luxury, etc. So I wrote it off, and thought that maybe this meant more park and coffee dates, or walks, all things that I still really enjoy.

He asked me to a baseball game a month ago. I don't like watching baseball but I was still enthusiastic about going because they has $2 hot dogs (lol). Tickets ran about $30. I had a good time and everything, until a few days after when he texted me and asked for an e-transfer (Canadian for Venmo) for the game. In all honesty, it caught me off guard since it was his idea to go. Of course, I paid him back, but I still didn't feel great about it. This was one of our first experiences and I didn't know he'd ask for an e-transfer or else I wouldn't have gone, as I don't like baseball.

We haven't been together long. I'd say it's divided pretty evenly on who pays the bill. We have inexpensive dates like I mentioned before, so not a lot of financial investment overall. The only other time he asked me to pay him back was for a $100 escape room on our first date, which was totally fair. I guess I was just taken aback, since I was unemployed at the time, and kept communting to downtown Toronto for him--which was about 30 minutes each way, $12 per trip, and an additional 40 minutes on the road to get back home. Yes, I was doing this of my own accord of course, but I suppose I'm a little saddened that despite all this commuting, time, and driving from me, he still invoiced me for $30. Hd doesn't venture out to my town a lot, unless I specifically ask. But again, maybe it's my fault since he did say that he was cheap.

Soooo, I guess I'm not sure where I go from here. Do I bring it up to him? Do I watch and observe? Or do I just let it go? Would appreciate if nayone could share their own experiences/if this has happened before.

Do I push for surgery??,"I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They‚Äôve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus, and I‚Äôd bleed through clothes and pads, would have to use heavy tampons and change them every couple of hours on the heaviest days- still happens now, just not ‚Äúas bad‚Äù.

I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier.

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I‚Äôd just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long‚Ä¶

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I‚Äôd explained all of these symptoms and problems I‚Äôd been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm ‚Äúpolyp‚Äù was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could‚Äôve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she‚Äôd book this in.

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that‚Äôs when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don‚Äôt think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn‚Äôt resolved at all.

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I‚Äôd gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc.

______________________________________
Between those dates, I‚Äôd stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I‚Äôm soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she‚Äôd book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time.

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024).

___________________________________

Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I‚Äôd still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I‚Äôd started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline.
___________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I‚Äôd been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025.

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago.

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn‚Äôt be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn‚Äôt know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn‚Äôt ask many questions. I‚Äôm just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking the worst.

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I‚Äôve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I‚Äôm just a bit worried, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just being a hypochondriac, and that I‚Äôve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I‚Äôm just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I‚Äôm just back to square one. I‚Äôm in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it‚Äôs endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.

___________________________________

Relaying back to symptoms etc:

Since November 2024, I‚Äôd been tracking my ‚Äúperiods‚Äù on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I‚Äôd been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I‚Äôm fixed!!!

But that was the last proper ‚Äúperiod‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn‚Äôt like a normal period. I didn‚Äôt have much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I‚Äôd had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few
__________________________________

So in all, I‚Äôm kinda worried it could be any number of things:

PCOS endometriosis amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia Hormone imbalance

I‚Äôm just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I‚Äôm never going to get the answers I‚Äôm looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there‚Äôs a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit?

Last thing- Can I request the scan notes at all? I feel like I just want to read it for myself and see what‚Äôs what?

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way.

This inspired me, perhaps not in the way my buddy expected.

So a few nights ago, I got on a site, and found a provider. I messaged her and she got back to me the next day. I booked for 2 days later, which gave me some anticipation time. This was both stressful as hell (because I had no idea what to expect), but also was something that truly got me truly excited with anticipation.

She was a BDSM provider, something that I had not really thought about. I got her lower priced ""kiss and cuddle"" session. I paid for 90m, and asked to meet at a coffee shop first so we could say hello.

We had coffee and then she took me to this cool ass dungeon place (it was a normal looking house in a sketchy neighborhood ). There were upside down neon crosses and jesus dildos lying around. There was also the ""pain room"" that she said we would not be visiting given the nature of the visit.

It was clean and safe.

I asked her slap the shit out of me and spit in my mouth during the cuddle session. Again, not something I anticipated but I asked for it after getting into the groove. She was hot.

The point of this post, anyway is not that you should go visiting a sex dungeon.

It's more about that you should try some random shit that you could not do before the divorce, and see how it goes for you.

- He was interacting with everyone (it felt like he had chemistry with everyone except me)

The original context was that she wanted to find a solid group of girl friends to go to bars and party with, and meet people im the process. It went well at first, but then (i kind of expecting) not all were committed to plans and just flaked/ some didn‚Äôt even commit to the plans etc,,. So it ended up being just a small group of 3/4 of us. We had lots of adventures and even with the small group, it was honestly fun. And me and her became friends, or more we trauma dump (lol) by text as she started DMing me instead of messaging im the groups. She was out of a long relationship, and is using dating apps so she‚Äôd tell me about who she met and all and i liked listening and engaging to it. She‚Äôs also really not a bad person, the type of people that you could tell are really good-hearted. But the thing is this: she really texts A LOT. And when i say a lot i am not even exaggerating. I‚Äôm talking about the type who‚Äôd reply after minutes at most with lots of texts or paragraphs, and if you reply once it won‚Äôt stop because she‚Äôd reply again and you‚Äôd just find yourself doing nothing but talk to her in hours. I legit dont even know how she does it, even the guys she‚Äôs seeing told her she‚Äôs the fastest person who replies they ever talked with, and i can admit that part of why 2 of the girls became uninterested was because she‚Äôd text a lot/ sends lots of memes/ reels etc and it‚Äôs obvious they can‚Äôt keep up so they mute the group. I dont have the details but she also apparently sleeps very little and works on a foreign company so she‚Äôd also stay up all the night just chatting.

I admit i first (which few months ago) i went along with, i did not have too much to do back then, i was just finishing school, and was jobless. It didn‚Äôt bother me to have someone to talk with instead of just watching something or sit alone. Also back then, she was talking to other guys on apps and texted a bit less. But as time went on i started my internship, started talking more with other friends or just got into other things (i started going out often with another girl of our group, mostly do sports together). While for her, she had bad experiences with one of the guys she met on bumble and she was genuinely getting depressed about it. The thing is that, she has very little dating experience, her ex was her highschool sweetheart, and despite being younger, there are some dating 101 that she doesn‚Äôt get even when i explain. One of them is dating someone with serious mental health issues (lonng story).

As a result, she‚Äôs taking a break from the apps and doesn‚Äôt want to go to party for now. I was pleased that we‚Äôd still be friends even without those plans because i liked her. But texting was becoming overwhelming and i started replying less and focusing on doing other things. And she was pissed about it, we have a very direct way of speaking to each other and we jokingly bash each other a lot so it is not her way of things that bothered me. But the fact that she started projecting and telling me she got used to ghosting (like that guy did) just because i replied after a day or by the end of the day did. She also randomly started saying that i only text her when i need her to go party (i genuinely dont know how she got to that conclusion) and each time we talk it was me justifying that i never intended to ghost her or why i dont reply fast. She‚Äôd also say that sometimes i was online but not talking to her, and dont like the fact that i am talking to my other friends and not her while simultaneously refusing to go out when i make plans even if it‚Äôs for a coffee or with the other girl i now go out with. I honestly had enough, and last time we talked i was catching a train because i was with my family, so when she texted me i did not reply and really forgot. 2 days ago i realised it was one of the few times she never texted again (she used to double text, and i did too when she was too depressed to reply, like i said we had a very spontaneous relationship). It‚Äôs been days and i was busy and now she‚Äôs avoiding me. I know that technically she is not wrong and i probably should reach out and text first if i want us to talk but i‚Äôve been too pissed about her attitude lately and dont want to go through the accusations and need to instantly reply so i didnt even bother. But now im second guessing my decision, because i‚Äôm realising i dont want to lose her as a friend and i miss the time we had together. The thing is that it just became a lot for me but i never wanted us to stop being friends.

What do you all think?

TLDR: i met a girl online who became my friend, she texts a lot and i couldnt keep up si i started replying less and she accused me if ghosting her because someone else did that to her. I accidentally forgot to reply and now she didnt text again. Should i reach out?",2,1758242171.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I had my whole day planned, it‚Äôs a random Thursday so I took off of work and was going to get some freebies and honestly just spend some time getting things I needed. I don‚Äôt mind being alone and quite enjoy avoiding the pressures others place on me.

In the past years I have spent them with my mom thrifting, but prior she had told me she was busy. No biggie, I was looking forward to it just being me.

Last minute she didn‚Äôt have the plans, and seemed disappointed that I was doing things by myself and made a big deal of me being alone on my birthday. So, I told her my plans and said she could tag along.

Come to today, she whined about every single one of them. I did not get to go anywhere because it was ‚Äútoo far‚Äù or ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù ‚Äúdangerous area‚Äù and whatnot. So the only thing I got to get was my coffee freebie.

We of course went thrifting, but only where she liked. And then whole time she complained about her being fat and how her body hurts (which is valid, chemo really messed it up), her marriage (my dad is not great), and how her kids never come see her and everything wrong with the world. She also complained about money and how all of her rich friends and people that are ‚Äúwell-off‚Äù (which would includes ME because I‚Äôve worked my ass off to be where I am) are never generous, but she is soooooo poor and is so generous to others.

She wasn‚Äôt mean, we didn‚Äôt fight. It was just emotionally exhausting as I have really been trying to heal from my shitty childhood. I just feel real bummed, because I‚Äôve been finally feeling good about who I am and making positive changes. My parents do not accept change well so I always put on a real good mask around them both. I just really wanted a low pressure day, and I didn‚Äôt get to go anywhere I planned. I have been waiting for this week because I finally had the day off to get some workout clothes and start the second half of my weight loss journey by going to get a gym membershipto our local 24hr gym (already down 110 lbs just by changing my diet and home workouts)

I also didn‚Äôt get to get my car back after not having it for 3 weeks because they forgot to order my windshield. Love my car and hate the vehicle I am driving right now. It will be done tomorrow, impeding on my other plans I had made to just be by myself. (I live in a rural area and have to drive 1hr there and 1hr back to get it).

**What it does:**

* Brews both **pods (K-cups)** *and* **ground coffee**
* Has a built-in **milk frother** for lattes/cappuccinos
* Lets you pick cup sizes (6‚Äì14 oz)
* Removable water reservoir + auto-clean + auto shut-off

**What I like:**

* Super convenient and compact, doesn‚Äôt eat counter space
* Being able to switch between pods and grounds is a nice bonus
* Frother is easy to use, makes decent foam for cappuccinos
* Quick cleanup compared to my old drip machine

**What I don‚Äôt love:**

* It‚Äôs not an espresso machine ‚Äî no real crema or high pressure shots
* Frother works, but don‚Äôt expect caf√©-quality microform
* Brew strength is a little lighter than I prefer unless I use my own grounds

**Overall:**  
If you want something versatile and simple for everyday coffee, it‚Äôs a good budget-friendly option. If you‚Äôre chasing caf√©-style espresso or silky flat whites, you‚Äôll probably want to invest in a higher-end machine.

Sorry in advance for the long post..

I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They‚Äôve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus, and I‚Äôd bleed through clothes and pads, would have to use heavy tampons and change them every couple of hours on the heaviest days- still happens now, just not ‚Äúas bad‚Äù.

I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier.

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I‚Äôd just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long‚Ä¶

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I‚Äôd explained all of these symptoms and problems I‚Äôd been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm ‚Äúpolyp‚Äù was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could‚Äôve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she‚Äôd book this in.

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that‚Äôs when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don‚Äôt think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn‚Äôt resolved at all.

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I‚Äôd gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc.

______________________________________
Between those dates, I‚Äôd stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I‚Äôm soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she‚Äôd book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time.

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024).

___________________________________

Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I‚Äôd still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I‚Äôd started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline.
___________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I‚Äôd been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025.

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago.

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn‚Äôt be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn‚Äôt know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn‚Äôt ask many questions. I‚Äôm just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking the worst.

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I‚Äôve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I‚Äôm just a bit worried, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just being a hypochondriac, and that I‚Äôve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I‚Äôm just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I‚Äôm just back to square one. I‚Äôm in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it‚Äôs endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.

___________________________________

Relaying back to symptoms etc:

Since November 2024, I‚Äôd been tracking my ‚Äúperiods‚Äù on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I‚Äôd been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I‚Äôm fixed!!!

But that was the last proper ‚Äúperiod‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn‚Äôt like a normal period. I didn‚Äôt much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I‚Äôd had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few
__________________________________

So in all, I‚Äôm kinda worried it could be any number of things:

PCOS endometriosis amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia Hormone imbalance

I‚Äôm just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I‚Äôm never going to get the answers I‚Äôm looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there‚Äôs a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit.

Last thing- Can I request the scan notes at all? I feel like I just want to read it for myself and see what‚Äôs what?

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way.

I was on 2.5mg for 4 weeks and 5mg for 6 weeks. Her focus is on the appetite suppression and suppression of food noise, not only on weight loss. I started noticing 3 or 4 days after my shot, I would be ravaging hungry all the time with crazy food noise, despite eating regularly and meeting caloric and nutritional goals. The most problematic and consistent side effect I‚Äôve had since Day 1 is constipation, but that is under decent control now.

Tuesday I took the first dose of 7.5mg. Started getting a headache that night, which I guess is normal for me - I got one the day I took my first dose of Zep and then another headache when I took my first dose of 5mg. The headaches all resolved within 24 hours - no biggie.

But today, 2 days after the 7.5mg, I have been so nauseated, feeling like I was fighting throwing up all day long. My stomach feels really upset, and because of that, all I‚Äôve had today is a protein shake with protein coffee (which nearly came back up), and a lot of water.

Here is the list of how I messed up from start to end: 
- Texting for hours everyday before meeting
- Choosing the 13th 
- Couldn't open the door of the caf√© (it was stuck!)
- Gave him a handshake 
- Gave him cookies (we actually talked about it and he wanted to taste them)
- He kept telling me that I speak quietly 
- We left the caf√© to go to the festival (I could sense that he lost interest in me)
- He was interacting with everyone (it felt like he had chemistry with everyone except me) 
- I gave him gum twice because we kept having stinky food (coffee and fried onion). Sharing my food is a cultural habit of mine that I should maybe get rid of. 
- Before meeting, he kept talking about all these date plans that we'll have. During the date, he never talked about meeting a second time. Not once.

He texted me if I arrived safely and that his mom liked the cookies (not him). He usually replies quickly, but he started taking exactly 10 minutes to reply just talking about his nicknames. Then, we wished each other good night, and he never texted me the next morning like he usually did.
I totally got ghosted. How can I improve? Should I text him? That was my first date ever. I've never had a boyfriend nor romantic experience. It's my first time putting myself out there.",0,1758241516.0,Bumble,1,0.5,False

I started at my new position about a month and a half ago. I am 40, female, diagnosed ADHD at age 9 and suspect autism. My interests have been my crutch and my support for most of my life. I was excited at this new position because even though many are younger than me, I saw a lot of similar nerdy interests going on.

One of the managers is a guy younger than me and he spends a lot of time with my team lead. They like to shit talk each other and gossip, which, okay, maybe I had some warning. I tried to engage him about his coffee cup, which had characters from one of my all-time favorite comics which is nearly as old as me. To my surprise when I told him I liked his coffee cup and that I loved that comic, he replied that I didn't really like it in a mocking tone. This happened two or three other times with other things, often with my team lead there backing him up. These were more or less some of the first conversations I had with this manager.

I was genuinely surprised and kind of hurt. Generally people that I meet who I share interests with are happy about it. I have never really experienced gatekeeping. Someone flatly saying that I don't like something that I really do is not something that I am used to at all. It's like they're saying that I'm lying, which is extremely upsetting to me due to some stuff from my childhood.

I stopped talking to this edgelord manager. After I visibly shut down and kind of retreated after these conversations, my team lead started acting kind of apologetic and backed off. I think she realized she had affected me. Now I barely talk to anyone at work except for this other guy that came on at the same time as me, who is a sweetheart who has also been affected by this place. It feels almost hostile here.

I'm aware it's probably due to age, being a female he didn't want to stick his dick into or he felt threatened? So he felt like he could fuck with me. I don't really get it at all. It was an invitation to sperg about our shared interest. I'm not sure how to handle the situation going forward.",2,1758241382.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

Misheard lyrics and trying to communicate with the person I love. 

My favorite person is NC with me and I try to get through to her, but when I try to, something, or someone comes between us. I can't read her mind and she can't read my mind. Which leads us to not knowing the full truth about this or that. 

I definitely would like to hear the truth. Id feel much lighter if my person knew the truth. About everything. Trying to convey this understanding through an online community isn't the most accurate or effective way to communicate. I don't know for certain which account(s) are my person. When I think it is, another person replies in message saying ‚Äú‚Äùnope I'm not her‚Äù. This has been happening for over 2.5 years to me and it brings me to tears in utter confusion. A plethora of people have impersonated her and I just wanted it to be her every time. Are you in a relationship with someone else? 

I care about my person and would never do anything intentionally to hurt her! My intentions are to let her know how much I care about her and that I apologize for every little thing I've done or said wrong. I love my person and miss being with her. I don't know how she feels because I have not heard from her. I feel that she loves me, or loved me before, then I feel hate, and in the end I don't have a conclusion. You matter to me! You and two other people matter the world to me. 

Unfortunately I live with depression and with losing my family and now house, it drove me to self medication. There's many other chotic events that keep knocking me down. Without my person, my best friend I feel absolutely helpless. I would do anything to help her. Fact: I hate self medicating. Fact: I love my family. I was in therapy but got kicked out because of not having state funded insurance. Then the renters who never paid and utility bills, I couldn't get back into therapy. I am doing everything in power to get back in now. Appointments are scheduled. I am trying. I have no friends to speak of so alas, I'm heading to AA for support. 

I hope that you received the flowers that were for you.You deserve to be spoiled. I will go all out for you. I was giving you too much space when I should have started showing you that I will take care of you and give you everything you missed. I want to work on our communication because I thought you didn't like kissing me anymore. I'll be working on my issues.   


I pray that you are taking care of yourself. Eating, drinking water and sleeping. Id be more than happy to cook you meals, massage you and pack you lunch everyday. 

I'm trying to get visits with **** again. DHS hasn't had anyone available for our visits, it's been difficult without her light in my heart. @kids: I love you and miss you to death. I'm going to fight hard for my family. If a miracle happens and I can come near my person, I'm saving the seat next to me on the bus for you. 

I crave to see my person and let her know how I feel. I'm hoping that the universe allows this. If you are available to rediscover communication over coffee? 

Love, your person

\- Steph C\*\*\*\*\*

*The Cult the World Forgot,* pg. 24

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My life was ruined the day I turned twelve years old.

Everyone wants to know what it was like growing up in a cult. They want to hear all the sordid details: did they beat you? Cut you? Was it a sex thing? If you‚Äôre not careful, you turn into an object of fascination, a human curio. All anyone cares about is what horrible thing might have happened in your past. And when you tell them the truth, they have the gall to be disappointed.

The truth is that before my twelfth birthday, my life was ordinary.

I grew up in a position of privilege. While my mother was just a washerwoman, my father was someone of status. He was the leader of our church. While he had many wives and many children, I was the only son. That meant I was treated with respect and deference. I wasn‚Äôt beaten or tortured. Neither were any of my friends or half-sisters. The only difference between my upbringing and others is while most parents probably read their children *Dr. Suess,* my father would read me the Apocrypha to rock me to sleep.

Like I said, a perfectly average life.

I had a friend, B. We were born on the same day, two hours apart. For the next twelve years, we lived right next to each other. We spent every moment of our growing up in each other‚Äôs company. We loved all of the same things: swimming, playing with wooden swords, building imaginary cities out of the crumbling stones of our home.

But above all else, we loved to explore.

We did not live in houses built by our own hand or surrounded by the confines of barbed wire traced fences like most cults. We lived in the ruins, or sanctuary as we referred to them.

When our ancestors came to the valley, lost, starving, and half-insane, they took the crumbling buildings as a sign from God. This was the paradise deity wished for us to inhabit. The ruins were a sprawling complex, crumbling roads and buildings all made of decaying stone cut from an unknown quarry. At the center of it all was a great gothic tower, stretching high over the landscape. It covered our entire settlement in its shadow. On quiet days, when the sky was overcast and muffled, some claimed you could hear it humming, a deep throaty noise that shook your bones and boiled your blood.

I can only imagine how desperate my progenitors must have been to see this place as their salvation.¬†

B and I first discovered the underground passages when we were ten. They formed a twisting labyrinth that extended beneath the whole city proper. We believed we had uncovered a great mystery, known only to ourselves, and began to explore those dark passages, armed with ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù candles and chalk.¬†

Our mothers discovered our first attempts, and forbade us from going back into those depths. But while we pretended to agree to never return, we would sneak away whenever we could to continue our efforts.

We discovered many things, secret passages between houses, abandoned rooms attached to our subterranean playground. Sometimes we even came across hidden places.¬†

When I was eleven years old. B and I had discovered a secret room attached to one of the tunnels. B had tripped on a rock and fallen through a wall when he tried to catch himself. The hole he created led to an open space, a room with a low ceiling. The walls were covered with all manner of carvings, and words that looked to be written in Greek. We were required to learn all the biblical languages as part of our grade school education, so we were familiar.¬†

But these words were different. The composition was all wrong, and the letters were scrambled and jumbled in odd formations.

B and I immediately made this into our own personal hide out. We would examine the pictures and strange words, sounding them out with untrained tongues and imagined pronunciations. We would speculate on their origins, and revel in the knowledge that no one knew of this room except for us.

One Sunday, we snuck off after church service to be in our hideout. In our tradition, the first part of worship was held in the courtyard of the tower every Sunday and was attended by all. The second session was held directly afterwards in the tower. Children were not allowed to attend. B and I often took advantage of this lack of supervision and went to the tunnels.¬†

That Sunday, we made our way to the room and began our usual game of creating theories as to what the words on the wall said. We were focused on a series of symbols that appeared together in several places around the room.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a verb?‚Äù I looked at B. His face was drawn up in an almost comical look of concentration. But he wasn‚Äôt playing it up. B just took thinking very seriously.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not.‚Äù B looked at me, indignant. ‚ÄúLook how many times they wrote it. That could be a sign. Elder Luke told me that‚Äôs a way you can tell.‚Äù

Elder Luke was our school teacher. He knew more about Christian lore than any other person alive. But that was not the most interesting thing about him. He had no arms. This wasn‚Äôt especially odd. It seemed like a lot of adults where we lived had similar problems. Some were missing fingers, toes. Elder Mark was missing his right leg from the knee down. But Elder Luke was missing both of his upper limbs, and was impaired by his lack. Each shoulder ended in a stump two inches extended from his torso.

B was the most intelligent child in our class. Elder Luke often turned to him when he needed to write things down. They also spent extra time together in tutoring sessions. Everyone knew it was to prepare B for his future calling. With his brain, it was only natural B would become a teacher and scriptorian.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù To tell the truth, I had no evidence to suggest otherwise. I was just jealous B seemed to be right about everything. I struggled in school, and sometimes I saw Elder Luke whispering to my Father at church, glancing in my direction. I was sure they were talking about how poorly I was doing.

B ignored me. He got close to the word and traced it with his finger. Dirt came away from it in fine grains, making the etching stand out on the wall. ‚ÄúIt looks familiar. I think I‚Äôve read it somewhere before.‚Äù

I probably would have kept arguing, except my thoughts were interrupted by a noise. It sounded like someone speaking. B and I looked at each other, and blew out our candles. Our mothers‚Äô had caught us in the tunnels a few weeks ago, and we weren‚Äôt eager to repeat that experience.

But as we waited in the dark, the sound developed. It wasn‚Äôt our mothers. It was human, but it wasn‚Äôt the tones of a normal composed voice. It was a pleading and begging wail. It grew louder, and more ragged. The desperate noise echoed on the walls, and I felt the hair on my neck prickle.¬†

The sound continued to expand. It became an open-mouthed keening, the kind you hear when one‚Äôs misery is so great the words don‚Äôt have time to form in your brain before the pain comes out of your throat. I had heard Sister Mary make that noise when her son had died of fever. It had gone on for what felt like years. At the time, I worried she would die too if she didn‚Äôt stop.

I found B in the dark and pulled myself closer to him. I felt B shift beside me, searching for something. There was a flare, and B relit his candle with a small piece of cloth he had set alight with his flint. He patted out the cloth until it stopped smoking and put it in his pocket. He reached over with his candle and lit mine.

I got up to look out the hole. I was worried that I would see whatever was making that sound the moment I poked my head out. But once my eyes cleared the wall, I saw nothing down either path.

B had a determined look on his face. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds close.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy. That noise‚Ä¶feels wrong.‚Äù

B got up to peek out with me. ‚ÄúIt sounded like crying. Someone might be hurt.‚Äù

This pricked my conscience. We were taught to help each other in church. Imagining someone down there, broken and afraid, was just enough of an emotional hit to make me rethink my fear. ‚Äú...Fine. I hate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but your mother doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I swung to hit B on the arm, but he ducked out of the way. He grinned at me. The playfulness cut the tension a bit and I could almost tell myself everything would be fine. But the noise sounding in my ears a moment later brought back all the old fears.

B left the room first. He stepped out into the dark, and made his way down the right hand tunnel. I followed. My feet dragged on the ground as I tried to keep up with him. We held our candles aloft, tiny pin pricks of light in the overpowering gloom.

With each turn in the tunnel, we went deeper. Soon, we exhausted all our familiar routes. When we turned onto an unknown path and heard the noise increase in volume, we knew we were close. The keening grew louder with each step. It began to reverberate in my chest. I wanted to cover my ears, to block it out. At every junction, I worried we were about to run headlong into the source of this terrible sound, only to feel relief when we saw nothing. But then we‚Äôd continue on, and the noise would grow clearer and more terrible than before.

Then just as we made another turn, the noise stopped.

Everything was silent. It was a long time until we began to hear the noise of the cave again, the dripping of water and the echo of flowing air.

B took another step forward, but I grabbed his shoulder. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. We‚Äôre gonna get lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounded like it was right around the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *gone.* If we don‚Äôt get back soon they‚Äôre gonna notice we‚Äôre not there.‚Äù

B shrugged off my hand and ran forward. I followed behind, not wanting to be left alone. We didn‚Äôt have to go far, we ran into a dead end almost immediately. It was a brick wall, similar to the kind that had blocked up our secret room. The stone was different from that of the tunnel. It was old, weathered, and was missing two bricks that had come loose and fallen to the ground. Where the two bricks had been was a dark hole.

B peered into it. I couldn‚Äôt see anything with the light of my candle. It was almost like the dark inside was swallowing the feeble yellow rays. My eyes played tricks on me. In the pitch black, it looked like shadows were moving around in the space beyond.

‚ÄúCan we go? Please?‚Äù

B kept peering into the hole. ‚ÄúI think I see something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come back later, okay? We‚Äôre gonna get caught.‚Äù I looked over my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt want to say it out loud, but it felt like someone was down here with us, watching. I saw no movement, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling like eyes were searching all over my body.

B turned to look at me, and saw how scared I was. He nodded slow, and pushed me forward. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

It took a long time to get to the surface. We had to double back a few times to make up for some incorrect turns. But eventually, we were in the sunlight again, and we joined up with the other children just as the adults returned from their meeting in the tower. I saw my father lead them out. Our mothers opened their arms to receive us. B and I embraced them. But even in the warmth of relief and safety, I couldn‚Äôt shake the cold feeling that still clung to my chest and mind.

While B and I still went to the room with the words, we never spoke of that noise again. Mostly, this was my fault. I had a hard time sleeping after the incident, and every time B tried to bring up the subject, I would shut him down.

A year passed, and I prepared for the acceptance of my calling and entrance into manhood. I had known since I was young that I was to become the next patriarch when it was time for my father to step down. That meant more school, and more time spent in his shadow. Before long, I didn‚Äôt have much time to spend with B anymore, and we stopped exploring the caverns.

Father would take me on long walks, explaining the importance of his role as leader. He often said strange things that made little sense to me. One night, as we were tending to my mother‚Äôs garden, he began to talk of the future, and how I would lead our church.¬†

‚ÄúYou must see things others can‚Äôt see.‚Äù He went to grab a weed, his hand missing the stem. He readjusted, grasped it with a firm hand and pulled it out the root still intact. My Father only possessed one eye. It was light blue, and sometimes I felt it could peer into my very soul. The empty socket was covered up in a bandage that swept over the side of his face.

I was old enough to think it was ironic that a man with one eye was telling me to see things, but I didn‚Äôt voice it. My father was a strict man. I had never seen his rage, but there was a coldness in his demeanor that made me fall silent in his presence. It took all my energy to find my voice to ask the proper question. ‚Äú...how do I do that? I‚Ä¶‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish the sentence. But Father knew what I meant. I was too stupid. Too slow. I barely saw what was under my own nose.

‚ÄúBe patient, son.‚Äù Father scooted closer to me, and put a hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and a little wet from the soil, but it was also comforting. ‚ÄúYou will understand. You are my blood. This is how it has been and will be.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt so sure, but I nodded and went back to work. I was still years away from any sort of responsibility, and there were more exciting things to look forward to now.

I was approaching my birthday. My twelfth birthday.

On that day, I would enter the tower.

It was a rite of passage for us. Most entered at the age of fifteen. Father had arranged it so I might enter early. He felt I was ready. I had looked forward to this day for as long as I could remember. Whenever anyone left the tower after worship, they always had the most blissful look of joy upon their faces.

I wanted that. I wanted to feel that joy, to see what was inside, to peer down from the top of its embankments and to see the entire valley like a bird might.

The night before my birthday, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I tossed and turned in my bed, imagining all the things that could possibly be inside of that strange and mysterious building.

It was near the middle of the night when I heard my mother crying.

I crept out of my cot and went to check on her. I had been spending time away to receive instruction from my father, and this next step was one that would alter our relationship. I would be a man when I emerged. I knew she wasn‚Äôt ready to let go of her little boy. I approached her living space and peeked in.

She was kneeling by her cot, her hands clasped in pleading supplication. I could not hear what she said, but I knew it to be whispered begging. ‚ÄúPlease, God, do not take my boy,‚Äù was the only phrase I heard in its completeness.

I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't make myself enter the room. I had the strange feeling I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. After a moment or two of indecision, I crept on light feet back to my own cot. I lay down, but I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. A new nervousness ate at my belly and made me stare at the dark ceiling until the light of torches roused from my bed.

The time had come.

Outside, my father and two attendants waited for my arrival. I roused and got dressed in the ceremonial robes of white. My mother presented them to me. Her eyes were dry, with seemingly no trace of the crying she had done the night before. Only a slight twinge of red betrayed her secret tears. I slipped the robes over my head, and gave her a hug, hoping to show her that everything was fine, that we would still be mother and son even after the events of this day.

She held me tight for a moment, her hands clasped around me. Then, when I began to wonder if she would ever let me go, I felt her hands release.

I kissed her on the cheek, then followed my father out of our house and to the tower.

Some had come to watch our procession. I saw B, staring at me with a serious look on his face. I smiled at him and waved, but all he gave me in return was a distracted nod. He looked up at the tower, then back at me. Eventually, our procession moved beyond his place and he was lost in the crowd.

The tower loomed larger with every step, and eventually we came to its entrance. My father stopped me. He turned me toward him and looked me in the eyes.

‚ÄúSon, a leader takes his role willingly.‚Äù His one eye caught mine and I had to fight the urge to look down. ‚ÄúWill you do what I say when the time comes?‚Äù

I swallowed down the nervous bile that was rising in the back of my throat. I nodded.

Father turned, and opened the door to the tower.

We stepped inside. It was dark, no light from the outside penetrated the stone walls. The torches the two attendants carried lit up the space. I looked up, surprised to see that the inside of the building was almost entirely hollow except for wooden supports. I could see all the way up to the roof, a small dark circle high above us.

There was a door at the far side. Father approached it and swung it open. Beyond it was a staircase leading downward. He bade me to follow, and then descended down into the darkness.

I waited a moment, anxious. Then I followed.

I don‚Äôt know how far down we went. I lost track of time trying to keep my footing on the cold stone stairs. I tried to keep pace with my father, his form obscured at the edge of the torchlight. The air grew cold, like it did in the tunnels under the city. I saw my breath coalesce in front of my face. I shivered, but I tried to hide it by stepping more firmly and clenching my muscles.

Without warning, the staircase leveled out into a smooth stone floor, cut directly into the rock. It stretched out to a small door at the end of a hallway. I swallowed and felt my ears pop. How deep had we gone?

Father made his way down the hall and opened the door, revealing a dark space on the other side. I approached until I was at his side. He gestured for me to go through before him.

I took a deep breath, and went into the blackness.

On the other side of the door was a large chamber. Its walls were smooth, unblemished. If it had been carved out of the rock, it had not been done by any human means. The polished surface almost reflected back the torchlight. Strange shapes I could not make out were huddled against the sides, and after a moment‚Äôs inspection, I realized they were large containers made from sanded wood and iron hinges.

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù My eyes went to my father. He had made his way to the center of the room without me noticing. He beckoned me with his hand.

He stood next to a low stone table.

The stone was cut at impossible right angles. The edges looked sharp enough to cut flesh. I came to him, aware of the attendants that followed close behind me. Surrounding the table were stone benches that made concentric circles, like a theater in the round.

‚ÄúLay down.‚Äù Father moved aside to grant me access to the flat surface.

I hesitated. I felt what I had in those tunnels a year ago, like eyes all around the room were watching us. I thought I could hear whispers in the echoes of our footsteps. The darkness had encompassed us so completely I could no longer see the walls. The air was strangely thick and hard to breathe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, son.‚Äù My father‚Äôs voice brought me back. I looked at him, and he smiled. He had never smiled at me before.

I laid down on the slab.

Father walked to the edge of the room. He spoke aloud to me, his voice bouncing off the walls and ceilings of the dome. It sounded to me as if he had never left my side. ‚ÄúYou have been instructed about the purpose of life. Tell me now, what is that purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo learn of the Almighty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is correct. And can you tell me why?‚Äù¬†

I struggled to remember what Elder Luke had taught us in school. I heard the sound of wood creaking. ‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶prepare ourselves for‚Ä¶for heaven?‚Äù

Father didn‚Äôt respond. I heard the clink of metal. I turned to look at him. His back was to me, and he was hunched over one of the boxes at the room's edge.

Finally, he rose up, and turned back to me. I looked up at the ceiling.

‚ÄúHalf-true. Tell me, son, what is heaven?‚Äù

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶place?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what is taught‚Ä¶‚Äù Father drew closer to me. His footsteps grew louder, and I fought to still my pounding heart. Both attendants stood at my side, torches in the air, their faces looking grim. ‚ÄúBut it is a lie. Heaven is not a place. It is knowledge. How do we gain knowledge?‚Äù

I knew the answer to this. It was part of a phrase Elder Luke recited to me almost every day. He loved to say it when I couldn‚Äôt remember the chapter or verse he was referring to. ‚ÄúBy sacrifice.‚Äù

My father stood above me now. His one eye stared down at me, cold and dark. My heart was beating out of my chest.

‚ÄúI told you that you would need to see what others could not.‚Äù Father moved his hand, and in it I could see a strange metallic instrument. One side was flat and sharp on the edge. The other was scooped like a spoon. He held it to a torch until, and it started to glow hot in the firelight. ‚ÄúPrepare yourself, son. It will only hurt for a moment.‚Äù

I knew then what he meant to do. Any courage that I had broke. I tried to get up, but the attendants pushed down my arms. I began to scream. ‚ÄúNo, no, NO! Please, Father! I don‚Äôt want to! STOP!‚Äù¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man. I was just a scared little boy. I couldn‚Äôt do this. I couldn‚Äôt do what my Father wanted.

The attendants became uncomfortable. One looked at Father. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not willing.‚Äù

Father's head moved with a jerk to look at him. For the first time in my life, I saw his anger. It burned dark and intensely on his features. I quavered and fell silent.

Father held the gaze of the other attendant for a long moment. ‚ÄúHe agreed. That is what matters.‚Äù

The metal instrument descended, smoking.

I saw the scooped edge come closer and closer to my face. I tried to shut my eyes against it, but I felt the steady pressure of father‚Äôs fingers pulling open the skin. I felt the heat of the metal held close. It was already unbearable. Father was strong, and it took no effort for him to secure my thrashing head with one hand. I cried out and tears ran down my face in twin rivers. I tasted salt as they flowed into my open mouth. I pled with my Father, begged him to stop.

The knife connected with my right eye.

It burned. It pressed deep into my skull, I saw bright flashes that took up the entire right side of my vision. I screamed so loud I felt my throat crack and I tasted the iron of blood. I felt liquid on my cheek that was thicker than my tears. The knife slowly passed around the entirety of the socket, singeing the skin away like tissue.¬† Father pulled, and it felt like a hot iron bar was being shoved through my head. After a moment of intense agony, I felt something give, and there was pressure on my right cheek. When I opened my left eye, I saw the opposite orb resting against my flesh, connected only by a thin string of bleeding flesh.

Father took up the eye, his fingers painfully cold upon it, and he severed the optic nerve.

Everything went dark.

I wanted to die, I wanted it to be over. I wondered if I was already dead. I could still feel the slab beneath me, the blood and tears on my face, the ache of my burns.

The darkness gathered.

What had been pure blackness before coalesced into shapes. Terrible beings defying all logic. They were all around me, staring at me with eyes half-obscured. Some had many limbs, and others bodies covered with mouths. They pressed forward, and I could feel their breath, the touch of their hands. They were so cold. I tried to fight, but the pain of it all was too great, and my arms and legs weakened. I felt my consciousness flee to a place where it might never return.

I heard my father speak before my mind left me.

‚ÄúWell done, my son.‚Äù

‚Äî

When I woke up, I was in an ambulance.

It has taken me years to recover from the lies of my childhood. I was young and not privy to all the complicated happenings of the outside world, nor were they spoken about in my presence. To me, there was no world outside of our community.

When I emerged unconscious from the tower, the settlement was being raided by the FBI.

Hikers had been going missing in the areas adjacent to our city for years. Investigations had uncovered disturbing documentation that indicated the violation of human rights. One look at me and my missing eye told them everything they needed to know. I was taken away and my father was arrested.

Far from being comforting, I was terrified. People joke about bringing those from the past to the modern era, about how they would go insane if they saw the progress of mankind. I very nearly did. For most of a month, I was sedated as they took care of my injuries and de-programed my brain so I could re-enter society.

After this process was done, they had me testify against my father to support the state‚Äôs case. The only charge that stuck was child abuse. He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, the maximum possible sentence.

I never saw my Mother after that day. I have no idea what happened to her.

It‚Äôs been two decades. I went through the foster care system. I found a pair of good parents willing to work with my sensitive past. I graduated high school, went to college, and even got a degree.

But it‚Äôs all been tainted. I can never escape my past. My missing eye is a constant reminder of who I am, where I came from, and how I‚Äôll never be able to escape into anonymity. I will always be the boy whose cult leader father took his eye.

And there are the visions as well.

Doctors said it was a form of PTSD. But I‚Äôm not so sure. At first, I would only see them out of the corner of my eyes. Dark shadows like the ones that appeared when my eye was taken. They would flit away if I ever tried to look at them properly. Sometimes I can feel the gaze of their¬† many eyes even before I see their presence.

I‚Äôve ignored it for years. But recently they have become bolder.

Just the other day, I saw one standing in a crowd as I waited in line to buy a coffee. It didn‚Äôt run when I looked at it. It just watched me, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, eyes blinking, mouths open, like it was waiting for something.

The Doctors keep prescribing pills, but they don‚Äôt work.

My father did something more to me in that cave than just take my eye. I worry it‚Äôs going to kill me. I‚Äôve been going deep, looking for any possible solution, no matter how crazy, to figure out how to stop this.

I got an email yesterday. It was from B, or someone who claimed to be him. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from him since the day I first entered the tower. I didn‚Äôt even know he was still alive. The email said he wants to meet me tomorrow. He says there are things we need to talk about.

I get emails like this sometimes, and normally put them right in the trash, but he said something that made me stop before I pressed the button.

‚ÄúI was right about the word on the wall. It‚Äôs a name.

I know about your visions.

Come see me, and I‚Äôll tell you how to stop them.‚Äù

Whoever sent this to me, I‚Äôm meeting them tomorrow.¬†

Sorry in advance for the long post.. 

I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They‚Äôve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus, and I‚Äôd bleed through clothes and pads, would have to use heavy tampons and change them every couple of hours on the heaviest days- still happens now, just not ‚Äúas bad‚Äù.


I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier. 

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I‚Äôd just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long‚Ä¶ 

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I‚Äôd explained all of these symptoms and problems I‚Äôd been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm ‚Äúpolyp‚Äù was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could‚Äôve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she‚Äôd book this in. 

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that‚Äôs when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. 
Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don‚Äôt think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn‚Äôt resolved at all. 

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I‚Äôd gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc. 
 
______________________________________
Between those dates, I‚Äôd stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I‚Äôm soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she‚Äôd book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time. 

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024). 
 
______________________________________
Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I‚Äôd still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I‚Äôd started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline. 
______________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I‚Äôd been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025. 

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago. 

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn‚Äôt be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn‚Äôt know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn‚Äôt ask many questions. I‚Äôm just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking the worst. 

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I‚Äôve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I‚Äôm just a bit worried, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just being a hypochondriac, and that I‚Äôve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I‚Äôm just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I‚Äôm just back to square one. I‚Äôm in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it‚Äôs endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.  
______________________________________
Relaying back to symptoms etc: 

Since November 2024, I‚Äôd been tracking my ‚Äúperiods‚Äù on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I‚Äôd been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I‚Äôm fixed!!! 


But that was the last proper ‚Äúperiod‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn‚Äôt like a normal period. I didn‚Äôt much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I‚Äôd had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few. 
______________________________________

So in all, I‚Äôm kinda worried it could be any number of things: 

PCOS 
endometriosis
amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia
Hormone imbalance 

I‚Äôm just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I‚Äôm never going to get the answers I‚Äôm looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there‚Äôs a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit. 

Last thing- Can I request the scan notes at all? I feel like I just want to read it for myself and see what‚Äôs what? 

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way. 

Thank you if you took the time to read all of this. ",1,1758241279.0,Endo,0,1.0,False

But the next one confuses me. It‚Äôs the Ethiopian Chelchele, and PERC sent me a brew tips email this evening (so cool!). However, one of the tips is this: 

‚ÄúUSE A COARSE GRIND!! Seriously. The Ethiopia Chelchele needs a coarser grind than our other seasonal coffees‚Äù  

It then provides:  

V60  
Grind: 500¬µm (much coarser)  
Dose: 20g  
Water: 300g  
Time: 3:15  
TDS: 1.48%  
Tasting notes: Blueberry and strawberry. Juicy body.  Aftertaste vanilla and creamy.  

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Looking at my handy (but not totally accurate) grind conversion chart and I quickly see that 500¬µm is squarely in the middle of ‚Äúmedium fine.‚Äù And roughly corresponds to a 2.9 on my ZP6 and a 10 on my Encore.

*The Cult the World Forgot,* pg. 24

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My life was ruined the day I turned twelve years old.

Everyone wants to know what it was like growing up in a cult. They want to hear all the sordid details: did they beat you? Cut you? Was it a sex thing? If you‚Äôre not careful, you turn into an object of fascination, a human curio. All anyone cares about is what horrible thing might have happened in your past. And when you tell them the truth, they have the gall to be disappointed.

The truth is that before my twelfth birthday, my life was ordinary.

I grew up in a position of privilege. While my mother was just a washerwoman, my father was someone of status. He was the leader of our church. While he had many wives and many children, I was the only son. That meant I was treated with respect and deference. I wasn‚Äôt beaten or tortured. Neither were any of my friends or half-sisters. The only difference between my upbringing and others is while most parents probably read their children *Dr. Suess,* my father would read me the Apocrypha to rock me to sleep.

Like I said, a perfectly average life.

I had a friend, B. We were born on the same day, two hours apart. For the next twelve years, we lived right next to each other. We spent every moment of our growing up in each other‚Äôs company. We loved all of the same things: swimming, playing with wooden swords, building imaginary cities out of the crumbling stones of our home.

But above all else, we loved to explore.

We did not live in houses built by our own hand or surrounded by the confines of barbed wire traced fences like most cults. We lived in the ruins, or sanctuary as we referred to them.

When our ancestors came to the valley, lost, starving, and half-insane, they took the crumbling buildings as a sign from God. This was the paradise deity wished for us to inhabit. The ruins were a sprawling complex, crumbling roads and buildings all made of decaying stone cut from an unknown quarry. At the center of it all was a great gothic tower, stretching high over the landscape. It covered our entire settlement in its shadow. On quiet days, when the sky was overcast and muffled, some claimed you could hear it humming, a deep throaty noise that shook your bones and boiled your blood.

I can only imagine how desperate my progenitors must have been to see this place as their salvation.¬†

B and I first discovered the underground passages when we were ten. They formed a twisting labyrinth that extended beneath the whole city proper. We believed we had uncovered a great mystery, known only to ourselves, and began to explore those dark passages, armed with ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù candles and chalk.¬†

Our mothers discovered our first attempts, and forbade us from going back into those depths. But while we pretended to agree to never return, we would sneak away whenever we could to continue our efforts.

We discovered many things, secret passages between houses, abandoned rooms attached to our subterranean playground. Sometimes we even came across hidden places.¬†

When I was eleven years old. B and I had discovered a secret room attached to one of the tunnels. B had tripped on a rock and fallen through a wall when he tried to catch himself. The hole he created led to an open space, a room with a low ceiling. The walls were covered with all manner of carvings, and words that looked to be written in Greek. We were required to learn all the biblical languages as part of our grade school education, so we were familiar.¬†

But these words were different. The composition was all wrong, and the letters were scrambled and jumbled in odd formations.

B and I immediately made this into our own personal hide out. We would examine the pictures and strange words, sounding them out with untrained tongues and imagined pronunciations. We would speculate on their origins, and revel in the knowledge that no one knew of this room except for us.

One Sunday, we snuck off after church service to be in our hideout. In our tradition, the first part of worship was held in the courtyard of the tower every Sunday and was attended by all. The second session was held directly afterwards in the tower. Children were not allowed to attend. B and I often took advantage of this lack of supervision and went to the tunnels.¬†

That Sunday, we made our way to the room and began our usual game of creating theories as to what the words on the wall said. We were focused on a series of symbols that appeared together in several places around the room.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a verb?‚Äù I looked at B. His face was drawn up in an almost comical look of concentration. But he wasn‚Äôt playing it up. B just took thinking very seriously.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not.‚Äù B looked at me, indignant. ‚ÄúLook how many times they wrote it. That could be a sign. Elder Luke told me that‚Äôs a way you can tell.‚Äù

Elder Luke was our school teacher. He knew more about Christian lore than any other person alive. But that was not the most interesting thing about him. He had no arms. This wasn‚Äôt especially odd. It seemed like a lot of adults where we lived had similar problems. Some were missing fingers, toes. Elder Mark was missing his right leg from the knee down. But Elder Luke was missing both of his upper limbs, and was impaired by his lack. Each shoulder ended in a stump two inches extended from his torso.

B was the most intelligent child in our class. Elder Luke often turned to him when he needed to write things down. They also spent extra time together in tutoring sessions. Everyone knew it was to prepare B for his future calling. With his brain, it was only natural B would become a teacher and scriptorian.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a name.‚Äù To tell the truth, I had no evidence to suggest otherwise. I was just jealous B seemed to be right about everything. I struggled in school, and sometimes I saw Elder Luke whispering to my Father at church, glancing in my direction. I was sure they were talking about how poorly I was doing.

B ignored me. He got close to the word and traced it with his finger. Dirt came away from it in fine grains, making the etching stand out on the wall. ‚ÄúIt looks familiar. I think I‚Äôve read it somewhere before.‚Äù

I probably would have kept arguing, except my thoughts were interrupted by a noise. It sounded like someone speaking. B and I looked at each other, and blew out our candles. Our mothers‚Äô had caught us in the tunnels a few weeks ago, and we weren‚Äôt eager to repeat that experience.

But as we waited in the dark, the sound developed. It wasn‚Äôt our mothers. It was human, but it wasn‚Äôt the tones of a normal composed voice. It was a pleading and begging wail. It grew louder, and more ragged. The desperate noise echoed on the walls, and I felt the hair on my neck prickle.¬†

The sound continued to expand. It became an open-mouthed keening, the kind you hear when one‚Äôs misery is so great the words don‚Äôt have time to form in your brain before the pain comes out of your throat. I had heard Sister Mary make that noise when her son had died of fever. It had gone on for what felt like years. At the time, I worried she would die too if she didn‚Äôt stop.

I found B in the dark and pulled myself closer to him. I felt B shift beside me, searching for something. There was a flare, and B relit his candle with a small piece of cloth he had set alight with his flint. He patted out the cloth until it stopped smoking and put it in his pocket. He reached over with his candle and lit mine.

I got up to look out the hole. I was worried that I would see whatever was making that sound the moment I poked my head out. But once my eyes cleared the wall, I saw nothing down either path.

B had a determined look on his face. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds close.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy. That noise‚Ä¶feels wrong.‚Äù

B got up to peek out with me. ‚ÄúIt sounded like crying. Someone might be hurt.‚Äù

This pricked my conscience. We were taught to help each other in church. Imagining someone down there, broken and afraid, was just enough of an emotional hit to make me rethink my fear. ‚Äú...Fine. I hate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but your mother doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I swung to hit B on the arm, but he ducked out of the way. He grinned at me. The playfulness cut the tension a bit and I could almost tell myself everything would be fine. But the noise sounding in my ears a moment later brought back all the old fears.

B left the room first. He stepped out into the dark, and made his way down the right hand tunnel. I followed. My feet dragged on the ground as I tried to keep up with him. We held our candles aloft, tiny pin pricks of light in the overpowering gloom.

With each turn in the tunnel, we went deeper. Soon, we exhausted all our familiar routes. When we turned onto an unknown path and heard the noise increase in volume, we knew we were close. The keening grew louder with each step. It began to reverberate in my chest. I wanted to cover my ears, to block it out. At every junction, I worried we were about to run headlong into the source of this terrible sound, only to feel relief when we saw nothing. But then we‚Äôd continue on, and the noise would grow clearer and more terrible than before.

Then just as we made another turn, the noise stopped.

Everything was silent. It was a long time until we began to hear the noise of the cave again, the dripping of water and the echo of flowing air.

B took another step forward, but I grabbed his shoulder. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. We‚Äôre gonna get lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounded like it was right around the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *gone.* If we don‚Äôt get back soon they‚Äôre gonna notice we‚Äôre not there.‚Äù

B shrugged off my hand and ran forward. I followed behind, not wanting to be left alone. We didn‚Äôt have to go far, we ran into a dead end almost immediately. It was a brick wall, similar to the kind that had blocked up our secret room. The stone was different from that of the tunnel. It was old, weathered, and was missing two bricks that had come loose and fallen to the ground. Where the two bricks had been was a dark hole.

B peered into it. I couldn‚Äôt see anything with the light of my candle. It was almost like the dark inside was swallowing the feeble yellow rays. My eyes played tricks on me. In the pitch black, it looked like shadows were moving around in the space beyond.

‚ÄúCan we go? Please?‚Äù

B kept peering into the hole. ‚ÄúI think I see something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come back later, okay? We‚Äôre gonna get caught.‚Äù I looked over my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt want to say it out loud, but it felt like someone was down here with us, watching. I saw no movement, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling like eyes were searching all over my body.

B turned to look at me, and saw how scared I was. He nodded slow, and pushed me forward. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

It took a long time to get to the surface. We had to double back a few times to make up for some incorrect turns. But eventually, we were in the sunlight again, and we joined up with the other children just as the adults returned from their meeting in the tower. I saw my father lead them out. Our mothers opened their arms to receive us. B and I embraced them. But even in the warmth of relief and safety, I couldn‚Äôt shake the cold feeling that still clung to my chest and mind.

While B and I still went to the room with the words, we never spoke of that noise again. Mostly, this was my fault. I had a hard time sleeping after the incident, and every time B tried to bring up the subject, I would shut him down.

A year passed, and I prepared for the acceptance of my calling and entrance into manhood. I had known since I was young that I was to become the next patriarch when it was time for my father to step down. That meant more school, and more time spent in his shadow. Before long, I didn‚Äôt have much time to spend with B anymore, and we stopped exploring the caverns.

Father would take me on long walks, explaining the importance of his role as leader. He often said strange things that made little sense to me. One night, as we were tending to my mother‚Äôs garden, he began to talk of the future, and how I would lead our church.¬†

‚ÄúYou must see things others can‚Äôt see.‚Äù He went to grab a weed, his hand missing the stem. He readjusted, grasped it with a firm hand and pulled it out the root still intact. My Father only possessed one eye. It was light blue, and sometimes I felt it could peer into my very soul. The empty socket was covered up in a bandage that swept over the side of his face.

I was old enough to think it was ironic that a man with one eye was telling me to see things, but I didn‚Äôt voice it. My father was a strict man. I had never seen his rage, but there was a coldness in his demeanor that made me fall silent in his presence. It took all my energy to find my voice to ask the proper question. ‚Äú...how do I do that? I‚Ä¶‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish the sentence. But Father knew what I meant. I was too stupid. Too slow. I barely saw what was under my own nose.

‚ÄúBe patient, son.‚Äù Father scooted closer to me, and put a hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and a little wet from the soil, but it was also comforting. ‚ÄúYou will understand. You are my blood. This is how it has been and will be.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt so sure, but I nodded and went back to work. I was still years away from any sort of responsibility, and there were more exciting things to look forward to now.

I was approaching my birthday. My twelfth birthday.

On that day, I would enter the tower.

It was a rite of passage for us. Most entered at the age of fifteen. Father had arranged it so I might enter early. He felt I was ready. I had looked forward to this day for as long as I could remember. Whenever anyone left the tower after worship, they always had the most blissful look of joy upon their faces.

I wanted that. I wanted to feel that joy, to see what was inside, to peer down from the top of its embankments and to see the entire valley like a bird might.

The night before my birthday, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I tossed and turned in my bed, imagining all the things that could possibly be inside of that strange and mysterious building.

It was near the middle of the night when I heard my mother crying.

I crept out of my cot and went to check on her. I had been spending time away to receive instruction from my father, and this next step was one that would alter our relationship. I would be a man when I emerged. I knew she wasn‚Äôt ready to let go of her little boy. I approached her living space and peeked in.

She was kneeling by her cot, her hands clasped in pleading supplication. I could not hear what she said, but I knew it to be whispered begging. ‚ÄúPlease, God, do not take my boy,‚Äù was the only phrase I heard in its completeness.

I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't make myself enter the room. I had the strange feeling I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. After a moment or two of indecision, I crept on light feet back to my own cot. I lay down, but I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. A new nervousness ate at my belly and made me stare at the dark ceiling until the light of torches roused from my bed.

The time had come.

Outside, my father and two attendants waited for my arrival. I roused and got dressed in the ceremonial robes of white. My mother presented them to me. Her eyes were dry, with seemingly no trace of the crying she had done the night before. Only a slight twinge of red betrayed her secret tears. I slipped the robes over my head, and gave her a hug, hoping to show her that everything was fine, that we would still be mother and son even after the events of this day.

She held me tight for a moment, her hands clasped around me. Then, when I began to wonder if she would ever let me go, I felt her hands release.

I kissed her on the cheek, then followed my father out of our house and to the tower.

Some had come to watch our procession. I saw B, staring at me with a serious look on his face. I smiled at him and waved, but all he gave me in return was a distracted nod. He looked up at the tower, then back at me. Eventually, our procession moved beyond his place and he was lost in the crowd.

The tower loomed larger with every step, and eventually we came to its entrance. My father stopped me. He turned me toward him and looked me in the eyes.

‚ÄúSon, a leader takes his role willingly.‚Äù His one eye caught mine and I had to fight the urge to look down. ‚ÄúWill you do what I say when the time comes?‚Äù

I swallowed down the nervous bile that was rising in the back of my throat. I nodded.

Father turned, and opened the door to the tower.

We stepped inside. It was dark, no light from the outside penetrated the stone walls. The torches the two attendants carried lit up the space. I looked up, surprised to see that the inside of the building was almost entirely hollow except for wooden supports. I could see all the way up to the roof, a small dark circle high above us.

There was a door at the far side. Father approached it and swung it open. Beyond it was a staircase leading downward. He bade me to follow, and then descended down into the darkness.

I waited a moment, anxious. Then I followed.

I don‚Äôt know how far down we went. I lost track of time trying to keep my footing on the cold stone stairs. I tried to keep pace with my father, his form obscured at the edge of the torchlight. The air grew cold, like it did in the tunnels under the city. I saw my breath coalesce in front of my face. I shivered, but I tried to hide it by stepping more firmly and clenching my muscles.

Without warning, the staircase leveled out into a smooth stone floor, cut directly into the rock. It stretched out to a small door at the end of a hallway. I swallowed and felt my ears pop. How deep had we gone?

Father made his way down the hall and opened the door, revealing a dark space on the other side. I approached until I was at his side. He gestured for me to go through before him.

I took a deep breath, and went into the blackness.

On the other side of the door was a large chamber. Its walls were smooth, unblemished. If it had been carved out of the rock, it had not been done by any human means. The polished surface almost reflected back the torchlight. Strange shapes I could not make out were huddled against the sides, and after a moment‚Äôs inspection, I realized they were large containers made from sanded wood and iron hinges.

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù My eyes went to my father. He had made his way to the center of the room without me noticing. He beckoned me with his hand.

He stood next to a low stone table.

The stone was cut at impossible right angles. The edges looked sharp enough to cut flesh. I came to him, aware of the attendants that followed close behind me. Surrounding the table were stone benches that made concentric circles, like a theater in the round.

‚ÄúLay down.‚Äù Father moved aside to grant me access to the flat surface.

I hesitated. I felt what I had in those tunnels a year ago, like eyes all around the room were watching us. I thought I could hear whispers in the echoes of our footsteps. The darkness had encompassed us so completely I could no longer see the walls. The air was strangely thick and hard to breathe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, son.‚Äù My father‚Äôs voice brought me back. I looked at him, and he smiled. He had never smiled at me before.

I laid down on the slab.

Father walked to the edge of the room. He spoke aloud to me, his voice bouncing off the walls and ceilings of the dome. It sounded to me as if he had never left my side. ‚ÄúYou have been instructed about the purpose of life. Tell me now, what is that purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo learn of the Almighty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is correct. And can you tell me why?‚Äù¬†

I struggled to remember what Elder Luke had taught us in school. I heard the sound of wood creaking. ‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶prepare ourselves for‚Ä¶for heaven?‚Äù

Father didn‚Äôt respond. I heard the clink of metal. I turned to look at him. His back was to me, and he was hunched over one of the boxes at the room's edge.

Finally, he rose up, and turned back to me. I looked up at the ceiling.

‚ÄúHalf-true. Tell me, son, what is heaven?‚Äù

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶place?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what is taught‚Ä¶‚Äù Father drew closer to me. His footsteps grew louder, and I fought to still my pounding heart. Both attendants stood at my side, torches in the air, their faces looking grim. ‚ÄúBut it is a lie. Heaven is not a place. It is knowledge. How do we gain knowledge?‚Äù

I knew the answer to this. It was part of a phrase Elder Luke recited to me almost every day. He loved to say it when I couldn‚Äôt remember the chapter or verse he was referring to. ‚ÄúBy sacrifice.‚Äù

My father stood above me now. His one eye stared down at me, cold and dark. My heart was beating out of my chest.

‚ÄúI told you that you would need to see what others could not.‚Äù Father moved his hand, and in it I could see a strange metallic instrument. One side was flat and sharp on the edge. The other was scooped like a spoon. He held it to a torch until, and it started to glow hot in the firelight. ‚ÄúPrepare yourself, son. It will only hurt for a moment.‚Äù

I knew then what he meant to do. Any courage that I had broke. I tried to get up, but the attendants pushed down my arms. I began to scream. ‚ÄúNo, no, NO! Please, Father! I don‚Äôt want to! STOP!‚Äù¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man. I was just a scared little boy. I couldn‚Äôt do this. I couldn‚Äôt do what my Father wanted.

The attendants became uncomfortable. One looked at Father. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not willing.‚Äù

Father's head moved with a jerk to look at him. For the first time in my life, I saw his anger. It burned dark and intensely on his features. I quavered and fell silent.

Father held the gaze of the other attendant for a long moment. ‚ÄúHe agreed. That is what matters.‚Äù

The metal instrument descended, smoking.

I saw the scooped edge come closer and closer to my face. I tried to shut my eyes against it, but I felt the steady pressure of father‚Äôs fingers pulling open the skin. I felt the heat of the metal held close. It was already unbearable. Father was strong, and it took no effort for him to secure my thrashing head with one hand. I cried out and tears ran down my face in twin rivers. I tasted salt as they flowed into my open mouth. I pled with my Father, begged him to stop.

The knife connected with my right eye.

It burned. It pressed deep into my skull, I saw bright flashes that took up the entire right side of my vision. I screamed so loud I felt my throat crack and I tasted the iron of blood. I felt liquid on my cheek that was thicker than my tears. The knife slowly passed around the entirety of the socket, singeing the skin away like tissue.¬† Father pulled, and it felt like a hot iron bar was being shoved through my head. After a moment of intense agony, I felt something give, and there was pressure on my right cheek. When I opened my left eye, I saw the opposite orb resting against my flesh, connected only by a thin string of bleeding flesh.

Father took up the eye, his fingers painfully cold upon it, and he severed the optic nerve.

Everything went dark.

I wanted to die, I wanted it to be over. I wondered if I was already dead. I could still feel the slab beneath me, the blood and tears on my face, the ache of my burns.

The darkness gathered.

What had been pure blackness before coalesced into shapes. Terrible beings defying all logic. They were all around me, staring at me with eyes half-obscured. Some had many limbs, and others bodies covered with mouths. They pressed forward, and I could feel their breath, the touch of their hands. They were so cold. I tried to fight, but the pain of it all was too great, and my arms and legs weakened. I felt my consciousness flee to a place where it might never return.

I heard my father speak before my mind left me.

‚ÄúWell done, my son.‚Äù

‚Äî

When I woke up, I was in an ambulance.

It has taken me years to recover from the lies of my childhood. I was young and not privy to all the complicated happenings of the outside world, nor were they spoken about in my presence. To me, there was no world outside of our community.

When I emerged unconscious from the tower, the settlement was being raided by the FBI.

Hikers had been going missing in the areas adjacent to our city for years. Investigations had uncovered disturbing documentation that indicated the violation of human rights. One look at me and my missing eye told them everything they needed to know. I was taken away and my father was arrested.

Far from being comforting, I was terrified. People joke about bringing those from the past to the modern era, about how they would go insane if they saw the progress of mankind. I very nearly did. For most of a month, I was sedated as they took care of my injuries and de-programed my brain so I could re-enter society.

After this process was done, they had me testify against my father to support the state‚Äôs case. The only charge that stuck was child abuse. He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, the maximum possible sentence.

I never saw my Mother after that day. I have no idea what happened to her.

It‚Äôs been two decades. I went through the foster care system. I found a pair of good parents willing to work with my sensitive past. I graduated high school, went to college, and even got a degree.

But it‚Äôs all been tainted. I can never escape my past. My missing eye is a constant reminder of who I am, where I came from, and how I‚Äôll never be able to escape into anonymity. I will always be the boy whose cult leader father took his eye.

And there are the visions as well.

Doctors said it was a form of PTSD. But I‚Äôm not so sure. At first, I would only see them out of the corner of my eyes. Dark shadows like the ones that appeared when my eye was taken. They would flit away if I ever tried to look at them properly. Sometimes I can feel the gaze of their¬† many eyes even before I see their presence.

I‚Äôve ignored it for years. But recently they have become bolder.

Just the other day, I saw one standing in a crowd as I waited in line to buy a coffee. It didn‚Äôt run when I looked at it. It just watched me, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, eyes blinking, mouths open, like it was waiting for something.

The Doctors keep prescribing pills, but they don‚Äôt work.

My father did something more to me in that cave than just take my eye. I worry it‚Äôs going to kill me. I‚Äôve been going deep, looking for any possible solution, no matter how crazy, to figure out how to stop this.

I got an email yesterday. It was from B, or someone who claimed to be him. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from him since the day I first entered the tower. I didn‚Äôt even know he was still alive. The email said he wants to meet me tomorrow. He says there are things we need to talk about.

I get emails like this sometimes, and normally put them right in the trash, but he said something that made me stop before I pressed the button.

‚ÄúI was right about the word on the wall. It‚Äôs a name.

I know about your visions.

Come see me, and I‚Äôll tell you how to stop them.‚Äù

Whoever sent this to me, I‚Äôm meeting them tomorrow.¬†

You‚Äôve probably heard about the cemetery just outside of town. Maybe you caught one of those grainy conspiracy YouTube videos about it. Or maybe your cousin swears he saw a TikTok where a guy gets flattened by a giant finger, and the comments all say ‚Äúskill issue‚Äù and spam skull emojis.

Either way, yeah. That‚Äôs my job. Graveyard shift at the actual graveyard. It‚Äôs every bit as fun as it sounds.

People like to ask me if the rumors are true. The hand? Real. We stopped trying to explain it a long time ago. It shows up every Wednesday at 4:00 a.m. on the dot. Floats down from the sky like it‚Äôs punching in for work. Then it finds something ‚Äî a rock, a squirrel, something that wasn‚Äôt there the night before ‚Äî and squishes it. It only ever uses the pointer finger. Very deliberate. Very moist. The last incident with the graverobber was very messy, but I can‚Äôt say that he didn‚Äôt have it coming.

Then there‚Äôs the zombie rave. It only happens when the New York Jets win a game, which means it‚Äôs more of a tragic biannual event than a consistent threat. But when it *does* happen, its a full-blown undead EDM festival. Glowsticks, fog machines, dubstep remixes of Gregorian chants. I think a few skeletons learned the truffle shuffle from it.

Last time, I caught Death himself bobbing his head near the drink table. He claims the fruit punch is ‚Äútranscendent.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt ask what was in it. I didn‚Äôt want to know. Besides, it can‚Äôt beat some Red Bull. Nothing can, really.

Look, weird stuff happens here. The grass changes color depending on your mood. The moss harmonizes when it rains. I once caught a raccoon arguing with a haunted typewriter about copyright law.

So no, I don‚Äôt get surprised anymore. Not really. That‚Äôs why, when the office vent cover rattled and a sooty black blur launched itself into the room like a feathery missile, I didn‚Äôt flinch. I just took another sip of cold coffee and shifted my chair to the left.

*THWACK.*

Right on schedule, Chuck smacked beak-first into the bulletin board, bounced off a memo that read *‚ÄúDO NOT FEED THE MIME AGAIN‚Äù*, and landed face-down on the desk like a pigeon that had just overdosed on espresso.

He lay there for a moment. Wings twitching. One leg spasmed. Then, with the theatrical effort of a dying Victorian widow, he rolled over and coughed up a crumpled envelope. I peeled it off the desk with two fingers.

‚ÄúMorning, Chuck.‚Äù

He gave a half-hearted croak that sounded like a chainsmoker gargling gravel.

For the record, Chuck is a raven. He‚Äôs been around longer than I have, and according to one of the older memos, he used to deliver for the Pony Express before getting ‚Äúreassigned.‚Äù

Now, he‚Äôs more or less how I get assignments. Job requests, inter-cemetery notices, sometimes death threats written in glitter gel pen. They‚Äôre all couriered by a bird with nicotine dependency and anger issues.

I fished a slightly crumpled pack of Newports out of the desk drawer, tapped one loose, and held it between two fingers. Chuck leaned forward, took it delicately in his beak, and waited while I lit it for him with a nearly empty Bic.

He puffed once, then let out a contented rasp and flapped his wings.

‚ÄúAtta boy.‚Äù

Chuck took off like a brick with wings, circled the room once, and vanished back into the vent with a sound like a deflating accordion. Ash fell on the desk. Something inside the wall thudded. Probably Chuck hitting something else. Again.

I turned my attention back to the envelope. It was sealed with black wax, and smelled faintly of sulfur and expired coupons. The front read simply:

*TO: HENRYFROM: MANAGEMENT*

Underneath, in smaller letters:

*Urgent.*

I sighed, cracked my neck, and opened it.

‚ÄúRe: Defensive Perimeter Status

The protective sigils around the chapel have faded again. Repainting is mandatory before dusk. Use only the approved glyphs from Standard Issue Ward Sigil Set (Rev. 6.66), located in the maintenance locker. Paint is in the containment fridge. The *left* fridge. Not the right one.

Please remember to wear gloves this time. We are still resolving the lawsuit from the last incident.‚Äù

‚Äî MANAGEMENT

Man, you screw up *once* and suddenly it‚Äôs a whole thing. No one even died. Not technically. And the mime‚Äôs already regrowing most of his fingers, so I don‚Äôt see the issue. I tossed the letter into the ‚Äúmaybe burn later‚Äù pile, stood up, cracked my back loud enough to wake the moderately dead, and made my way to the fridge.

Not the right one. Got it. Still going in the right fridge though.

The shack had two fridges. One for edible things. One for things that probably shouldn‚Äôt exist outside of an extradimensional containment vault. They weren‚Äôt labeled, but the edible one had a magnet shaped like a ferret, and the other occasionally whispered in Aramaic when the power flickered.

Before anything though, I needed a drink. I opened the right and was immediately greeted by a waft of cold air, the scent of electrical fire, and the disapproving stare of Ares, the Greek god of war, who lived on the second shelf next to a suspicious jar of pickles and a foil-wrapped thing I‚Äôm pretty sure was once a sandwich, now classified as a biohazard.

***‚ÄúAh,‚Äù*** Ares said, his mango form glistening with condensation. ***‚ÄúThe mortal awakens.‚Äù***

‚ÄúTechnically I‚Äôve been awake since noon,‚Äù I said, brushing frost off a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúBut thanks for the melodrama.‚Äù

***‚ÄúI sensed your need for energy. I predicted your arrival. I am battle-read‚Äî‚Äù***

I slammed the fridge door shut before he could finish whatever weird fridge-prophecy he was about to monologue. A faint *thunk* came from inside.

**‚Äú*****Rude!*****‚Äù**¬†

I cracked open the Red Bull, took a sip, and felt my soul leave my body for a brief, chemically-induced vacation.

***‚ÄúI hear you drink!‚Äù***

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, staring into the distance. ‚ÄúJust stay cool.‚Äù

He muttered something in what I assume is ancient Greek. Probably an insult. Possibly a curse. Either way, he‚Äôd get over it.

Let me back up a second.

You‚Äôre probably wondering why there‚Äôs a talking mango in my fridge that thinks it‚Äôs the Greek god of war. Reasonable question. I ask myself that sometimes, too. Usually while drinking. Or smoking.

Ares showed up on my third night working here, wrapped in butcher paper and left in the fridge. There was no note or anything. Just a mango.

I almost ate him. That‚Äôs not a joke. I picked him up, sniffed him, and was halfway through grabbing a knife when he started glowing red and yelled,

*‚Äú****I AM ARES, DESTROYER OF MEN AND RIPENER OF FLESH.****‚Äù*

I dropped him. He bounced and then called me a coward. Then, he rolled himself toward the fridge, hopped in, declared it his throne of frost, and said that I was now his ‚Äúmortal retainer.‚Äù

I tried to throw him out later that night. The next day, the toilet flooded with blood and my phone's language setting was stuck in Greek. He was back in the fridge too. So, yeah. I let him stay.

He mostly keeps to himself and just lives on the second shelf, hoards expired yogurts, and occasionally offers unsolicited tactical advice whenever I play Solitaire.

I took a sip of Red Bull, grabbed my gloves, the glowing stencil kit, and the gallon of neon-pink sigil paint (which is currently humming the theme from *Jurassic Park*) from the proper fridge, and headed for the chapel.

Time to draw weird symbols on ancient stone to keep the apocalypse at bay. Again.

I stepped out of the cabin and into the cool, ever-present fog that blanketed Restfield Memorial Park. The night air smelled like damp stone and despair, with a hint of something metallic. Probably leftover from last month‚Äôs *incident* with the mime. Still not my fault.

I made my way over, the gravel crunching under my boots. Somewhere, a distant owl hooted, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was an actual bird or one of the ghostly jazz musicians who liked to practice improvised solos at ungodly hours.

The chapel sat at the center of the cemetery, a squat building with peeling paint and more cracked windows than an abandoned window shop. Its walls were covered in the faded sigils that kept the worst of the cemetery‚Äôs neighbors from wandering off. At least, that was the theory.

I knelt by the nearest remaining sigil from last time ‚Äî a twisted, spiky rune that looked less like a meaningful symbol and more like the scribbles of a toddler with nerve damage ‚Äî and peeled back the stencil.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you can stay in the lines this time.‚Äù

The paint hissed and shimmered as I dipped the brush, glowing a bright, angry pink that illuminated the cracked stone like a neon warning sign.

I started filling in the gaps, the glowing symbols slowly coming back to life under my careful strokes.

Then, the paint started to move*.* Not in a ‚Äúwhoa, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù way. More like a ‚ÄúHey, buddy, I‚Äôm not done yet‚Äù kind of way.

The edges of the sigil wriggled and pulsed like a living thing, warping just slightly out of shape.¬†

Suddenly, a voice echoed in the silence.

‚ÄúOh, you call that a line?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even look up.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúRight on cue.‚Äù

The paint shimmered, and sure enough, a tiny face formed in the pink glow ‚Äî a swirl of mist and attitude ‚Äî perched right where my curve had dipped a little too hard to the left.

It blinked at me with a look that said it had seen better art from blind wombats. A smoky eyebrow arched. Wispy arms folded across an equally wispy chest.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù it said, voice all smug and static. ‚ÄúLook at you. Gloves this time. Maybe you‚Äôre not a complete moron.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm-hm.‚Äù I kept painting.

‚ÄúYou gonna say anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrying not to,‚Äù I said, not bothering to break my brush stroke.

It floated closer. ‚ÄúYou know you botched that curve, right? Should be three spikes, not two. And that bottom arc? That‚Äôs not even a warding loop.‚Äù

I dabbed the brush in the paint again and gave it a lazy swirl. ‚ÄúNoted. Thanks for the unsolicited critique, Bob Ross.‚Äù

The sprite puffed up like an angry vape cloud. ‚ÄúIf you cared about quality, maybe you‚Äôd let a professional handle it.‚Äù

I adjusted the stencil slightly. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre volunteering, be my guest. Until then, shut up and let me work.‚Äù

It huffed, a little puff of pink mist with the emotional energy of a teenager slamming a bedroom door, and then melted back into the paint. The sigil pulsed once, dramatically.

I yawned. ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Be offended. Join the club.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I heard footsteps behind me.

I spun around.

A figure stood at the edge of the chapel‚Äôs porch, silhouetted in the moonlight. Tall, draped in an oversized trench coat, with a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. It was the kind of silhouette that either sells cursed VHS tapes out of a trench coat, or flashes people while quoting Nietzsche. Hard to say. I‚Äôve dealt with both out here. Once it was the same guy.

I blinked, trying to decide if I should tell them to get lost or bum me a cigarette. They stepped forward, hands raised in a friendly gesture.

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù they said, voice rough like gravel mixed with cigarette smoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here about the job.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe job?‚Äù I repeated, wiping paint off my gloves.

‚ÄúYou know. The sigils. Management sent me to ‚Äòassist.‚Äô I‚Äôm the new night consultant.‚Äù

I arched an eyebrow.

‚ÄúNight consultant?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Name‚Äôs Marlowe. I specialize in... unconventional maintenance. Management hired me for tonight. Said you could use the help after the last‚Ä¶incident‚Äù

I crossed my arms, leveling a look at the guy.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said slowly, ‚Äúbut I really don‚Äôt think the last incident was bad enough to warrant backup.‚Äù

Marlowe didn‚Äôt respond right away. Just looked at me, unblinking, like he was waiting for me to realize something I hadn‚Äôt yet.

I held up my gloved hands. ‚ÄúLook. Gloves. I‚Äôm taking precautions. No repeats. Mime‚Äôs gonna be fine. Eventually.‚Äù

Marlowe gave the faintest twitch of a smile. ‚ÄúTell that to your bosses. They said you needed supervision. I‚Äôm just here for the night. ‚Äù

I made a noise halfway between a scoff and a groan. ‚ÄúWhat I *needed* was for the containment paint to not... react. It wasn‚Äôt even that much. Just a little drop on my hand.‚Äù

Marlowe shot me a glance.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said defensively. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs got an evil doppelg√§nger story these days. Mine just happened to be... a little aggressive.""

There was a long silence. Somewhere in the fog, a duck quacked ominously. Or possibly a demon. Hard to tell.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I added, ‚Äúif anyone should be getting monitored, it‚Äôs the mime. He started it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour clone made him speak in tongues and blew up his arm,‚Äù Marlowe said flatly.

I jabbed a thumb toward the sigil. ‚ÄúAnd *he*‚Äî‚Äù I gestured vaguely at the glowing, humming symbol, ‚Äú‚Äîcritiqued my brush technique mid-paint. Again. No one‚Äôs writing *him* up.‚Äù

Marlowe didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúManagement said to assist. Not argue.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. So I‚Äôm the problem *and* I get company.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTrust me, I‚Äôm not thrilled either. Let‚Äôs just get through the night without a clone, a maimed mime, or a lawsuit.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Marlowe didn‚Äôt say anything. He just pulled out a pair of matte black gloves from somewhere inside his coat and crouched down beside me like this was just another Tuesday night.

I watched him for a second, casually swirling a brush through the glowing neon-pink paint, which buzzed faintly like an angry soda can. The air around it shimmered.

I followed his lead, dipped the brush, and got to work on the next sigil, tracing the¬† jagged outer ring. Next to me, Marlowe was already halfway through another one, moving with sharp, mechanical precision.

No hesitation. No nonsense. Guy painted like a pro.

We were three symbols in when the paint pulsed slightly in the brush. I didn‚Äôt even flinch as the familiar little face popped out of the wall in a puff of pinkish mist, smirking like a discount genie.

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù it groaned dramatically. ‚ÄúYou brought a friend? Great. I can‚Äôt wait to watch two idiots bungle a warding circle.‚Äù

Marlowe straightened up slightly, eyeing the floating face like it owed him money. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a paint sprite. Don‚Äôt feed him attention, it just encourages the sass.‚Äù

Marlowe set his brush down. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sentient paint?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse you,‚Äù It snapped. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ward construct with autonomous commentary functionality‚Äî‚Äù

Marlowe, still calm as a coma, reached into his coat, pulled out a pistol, and raised it toward the floating face.

The sprite blinked. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Marlowe clicked the safety off.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt shoot me, I‚Äôm made of paint!‚Äù

‚ÄúWanna test that theory?‚Äù

It stared at the barrel.

Then *poof*. Gone in a puff of pink smoke.

I arched an eyebrow. ‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù

Marlowe holstered the gun like that was a perfectly normal Tuesday response to an annoying supernatural graffiti sprite.

‚ÄúDid you just threaten paint with a firearm?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it worked?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

We went back to painting. The air was quieter now. Peaceful, even. Just the hiss of glowing paint, the rustle of fog, and the distant honk of something in the woods that was probably not a goose.

We spent the next couple of hours working our way around the chapel, brushing fresh glyphs over stone. Sigil after sigil, each one glowing pink like angry cotton candy, humming softly with restrained cosmic spite. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Marlowe worked like someone who was born holding a paintbrush and raised by pessimistic monks. Efficient. Quiet. Focused.

I appreciated it.

Mostly, nothing happened. No screams from beneath the chapel. No ghost choir doing warmups. No paint sprite came back.

The only incident, if you could even call it that, happened near the northern wall. I was halfway through a sigil when a plume of smoke shot up from the base of the it. Not the usual wispy kind that hints at ancient energy waking up, either. No, this was full-on, honest-to-god fire.

‚ÄúUh,‚Äù I said, stepping back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs new.‚Äù

Marlowe didn‚Äôt flinch. He just glanced at it like it was a mildly rude cashier. The flames, now clearly forming into the unmistakable shape of a middle finger, flickered angrily and let out a faint hissing sound.

‚ÄúThat your fault?‚Äù Marlowe asked.

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

We stared at it in silence for a beat. It twitched slightly then flared a bit higher. I sighed, pulled the emergency sigil extinguisher out of my bag (basically a glorified squirt bottle blessed by a sleepy priest and filled with holy water), and gave it a few good sprays.

The fire hissed, sputtered, and then, with one last petulant flicker, vanished. It left behind a char mark shaped like someone flipping the bird. We stood there for a moment. The wind shifted.¬†

Marlowe wiped a bit of soot off the edge of his coat. ‚ÄúNot our fault,‚Äù he said firmly.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I agreed. ‚ÄúDefinitely not.‚Äù

We got back to painting like nothing had happened. Because around here? That barely even registered.



We finished the last sigil just after four.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, stepping back from the final glyph. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all of them. Intact. Glowing. No runes overwritten by slurs this time.‚Äù

Marlowe gave the wall a quick glance, then nodded. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll hold.‚Äù

I wiped my hands on a rag, flexed my fingers in my gloves, and turned to Marlowe.

‚ÄúAnyway, I appreciate the assist. It‚Äôs rare I finish a job without something big happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù he said simply.

Then he turned and walked off, just like that. No goodbye. No handshake. Just faded into the fog like the final scene of a noir film. I didn‚Äôt even hear his footsteps after a few seconds.

I watched the empty path for a moment, then shrugged.

‚ÄúAlright, back to the office.‚Äù

Back in the cabin, the ceiling light flickered. I was ready for a cup of instant coffee, a stale granola bar, and possibly yelling at Ares for turning the fridge temp up again. But then, my phone started buzzing.

Caller ID: Jessica.

I squinted. It wasn‚Äôt like her to call this late. She was more of a ‚Äútext in passive-aggressive bullet points‚Äù kind of supervisor. Still, I picked up, holding the phone between my shoulder and ear while pouring a mug of whatever the coffee maker was willing to give me tonight.

‚ÄúJessica,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúif this is about the Fruit Roll-Ups again, I didn‚Äôt eat them. Ares did.‚Äù

A pause.

Then her voice, sharp and clipped like always. ‚ÄúHenry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust got out of that weekly incident review meeting. Finally free for the night.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDid the big boss or Death show up again? Or did they just send another hallucination?‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither. Just Gary from Legal, which is arguably worse.‚Äù A rustle, like she was flipping through notes. ‚ÄúAnyway. I saw the alert about the church perimeter needing a refresh. Just wanted to check in. Need any backup?‚Äù

I blinked and sipped my coffee.

‚ÄúWait. What?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe chapel sigils. You know. Paint, stencils, the like. Do you need help or have you already handled it?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúHandled it.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I just wrapped it up maybe fifteen minutes ago. All done.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid *you* do them?‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnically,‚Äù I said, dragging a stool out and dropping into it. ‚ÄúI had help. Management sent a guy.‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me *Management* sent someone to *help* you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Some guy named Marlowe. Said he was a ‚Äònight consultant.‚Äô Wore a big coat, deadpan stare, paint skills suspiciously on point. Real friendly.‚Äù

Jessica didn‚Äôt respond right away. I could almost hear her blinking through the phone.

‚ÄúThey sent a *what*?‚Äù

‚ÄúA night consultant. He said they hired him for the evening. To help. His words, not mine. I didn‚Äôt exactly request backup, but he showed up, had my name, knew the job, didn‚Äôt start glowing or chanting, so I figured‚Äîsure. Why not?‚Äù

‚ÄúHenry,‚Äù she said slowly, ‚ÄúManagement didn‚Äôt send anyone.‚Äù

‚Äú...You sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd know. I handle all off-hour personnel clearances. You think Management would talk to someone directly? I‚Äôm the bottleneck. I‚Äôd have had to sign him in, review the contract, go through the binding clauses, the standard exorcism waiver. None of that happened. No Marlowe. No consultant. Nothing.‚Äù

I stared into my coffee. It didn‚Äôt offer any answers. Just a faint steam shaped like Australia.

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù I said carefully, ‚Äúhe knew about the sigils. Helped paint them. Knew which stencil to use, and the fact that the paint talks now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe talked to the sprite?‚Äù

‚ÄúThreatened it, actually. With a gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said flatly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a new one.‚Äù

‚ÄúI kind of respected it. I might have to try it. On a separate note, can you guys give me a gun?‚Äù

She exhaled, completely ignoring my question. ‚ÄúHenry, you *do* realize that means a complete stranger showed up on restricted cemetery grounds during an active ritual maintenance window, claimed Management credentials, and you just... let him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you *remember* what happened the last time someone showed up claiming to be from Management?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn my defense,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthey had a badge, a clipboard, and a lanyard. And nobody could‚Äôve guessed it was just seventeen raccoons in a trench coat trying to steal the snacks.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not helping your case.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said, standing up and starting to pace. ‚ÄúMarlowe wasn‚Äôt weird. Not *cemetery* weird, anyway. No glowing eyes, no shadow manipulation. He didn‚Äôt even float, or hiss, or try to sell me essential oils.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your new bar for trust?‚Äù

‚ÄúKind of, yeah.‚Äù

She made a noise, somewhere between a groan and a resigned sigh. The kind of sound people make when they remember they‚Äôre stuck supervising me.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said finally. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just... back it up. He said *Management* sent him?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd used the title ‚Äònight consultant‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúVerbatim.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even a real title.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds real enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs no such listing in our personnel files. Nothing in the contractor rolls either. I just checked.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo...?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo either this guy‚Äôs rogue, or Management actually hired someone without telling me, which would be‚Äî‚Äù she stopped herself, took a breath, then added dryly, ‚Äú‚Äî*extremely* on brand.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I be worried?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù Jessica said. ‚ÄúIf he *wasn‚Äôt* trying to kill you, eat you, or replace you... that might be the most normal interaction you‚Äôve had this month.‚Äù

I took a long sip of coffee.

‚ÄúThat's‚Ä¶probably true.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust keep an eye out. If you see him again, don‚Äôt engage. And for the love of god, don‚Äôt give him a W-2.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, check the chapel sigils tomorrow. Make sure they‚Äôre not, I don‚Äôt know, glyphs for summoning something stupid like the sandwich society.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought they got shut down.‚Äù

‚ÄúLegally, yes. Spiritually, who knows?‚Äù

There was a pause as she shuffled some papers.

‚ÄúAnything else weird happen tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúDefine ‚Äòweird.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. I‚Äôm gonna pretend this conversation was reassuring and finish my coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo that. I‚Äôll follow up in the morning. Don‚Äôt die.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

She hung up. I stared at the phone for a second, then dropped it on the desk next to the crumpled envelope from earlier. Outside, something distant howled. Or maybe yawned. I couldn‚Äôt tell.

Business as usual.

Just looking for some insights lalo na from men kasi di ko alam how this usually goes. For context, I'm 24F and may co-worker ako 33M. Nasa same team kami and nasa same circle of friends din kami sa work (nagkikita-kita kami even outside working hours). Magkakilala kami for 4 years already and recently lang umamin sya na matagal na sya may gusto sakin. Nagpapaalam sya kung pwede sya manligaw. Very non-chalant lang sya as a person and hindi sya expressive. Kahit magkakasama kami, parang wala sya pake sayo ganun kasi di rin sya gentleman kaya di ko inexpect na aamin sya at may feelings sya sakin. Never rin pa sya nagkagirlfiend and first time lang nya umamin kasi torpe daw sya. Sabi ko pag iisipan ko if papayagan ko sya at nasa 1 week na lumipas since umamin sya. 

Question ko lang is, kahit kasi umamin na sya, wala parin nagbago sa kilos nya. Binawasan lang nya yung pagiging nonchalant nya sa chat pero yun na yun. Kahit magkachat kami at magkasama sa office, pag uuwi na kami never man lang nya ko sinabihan ng ingat or chat na kung nakauwi na ba ako. One time, umalis kami saglit sa office para bumili ng coffee pero di sya nagsasalita sa cashier so ako pa kumuha at nagsabi ng order naming dalawa. After rin nya umamin, di man lang nya ko hinatid sa sakayan.

Ganun ba talaga yun kasi di pa ko nagbibigay ng sagot sakanya? Na tska lang sya mag eexpress pag may go signal ko na? Medyo di parin kasi ako naniniwala na may gusto sya sakin kasi hindi ko talaga maramdaman. Di ko alam kung factor na non-chalant sya at di expressive. 1st time lang din kasi may umamin sakin at may nagpaalam manligaw kaya di ko alam kung ganito ba talaga.

Sorry in advance for the long post.. 

I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They‚Äôve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus. 

I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier. 

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I‚Äôd just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long‚Ä¶ 

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I‚Äôd explained all of these symptoms and problems I‚Äôd been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm ‚Äúpolyp‚Äù was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could‚Äôve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she‚Äôd book this in. 

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that‚Äôs when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. 
Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don‚Äôt think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn‚Äôt resolved at all. 

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I‚Äôd gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc. 
 
______________________________________
Between those dates, I‚Äôd stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I‚Äôm soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she‚Äôd book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time. 

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024). 
 
______________________________________
Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I‚Äôd still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I‚Äôd started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline. 
______________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I‚Äôd been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025. 

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago. 

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn‚Äôt be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn‚Äôt know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn‚Äôt ask many questions. I‚Äôm just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking the worst. 

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I‚Äôve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I‚Äôm just a bit worried, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just being a hypochondriac, and that I‚Äôve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I‚Äôm just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I‚Äôm just back to square one. I‚Äôm in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it‚Äôs endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.  
______________________________________
Relaying back to symptoms etc: 

Since November 2024, I‚Äôd been tracking my ‚Äúperiods‚Äù on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I‚Äôd been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I‚Äôm fixed!!! 


But that was the last proper ‚Äúperiod‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn‚Äôt like a normal period. I didn‚Äôt much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I‚Äôd had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few. 
______________________________________

So in all, I‚Äôm kinda worried it could be any number of things: 

PCOS 
endometriosis
amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia
Hormone imbalance 

I‚Äôm just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I‚Äôm never going to get the answers I‚Äôm looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there‚Äôs a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit. 

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way.

Pretty much my whole life, I suffered from poor self-image/ worth. IDK where this came about from, but it haunted me forever, no matter what my parents and friends would say. It affected everything about my life from my academics being God Awful to me having no motivation to do anything and having a horrible image of my self (I couldn't look at myself in the mirror for two years without crying). I struggled to make friends and open up if I didn't grow up with them. However, during college, I really locked in and fixed everything academically and began to invest in my appearance and how to be social (my one best friend jokes about how I ""overcame"" autism). And it really paid off, I became way more social, made lots of new friends, and even had some women who were attracted to me (trust me 16-year-old me thought I was unlovable and unworthy of love).  The most important thing is that I grew as a person passed most of my self hate and un worthiness, like I truly learned how to love myself and love others by becoming more loving of others atleast to the best of my ability. Now I'm known as mature, funny, caring, and a chill person to be around all while accomplishing professional goals.

Anyways in my current day I'm just left confused, like I know who I am and what I'm capable of but there always seems like something more I need to do regarding myself. Like one thing that sucks is that I never compliment and I'm pretty sure it cost me a potential relationship with a classmate. Like she's an amazingly chill person with a cool personality who was very heavy-handed with interest. We chatted for a bit and I asked her out for coffee (which went super well like lasted 2 and a half hours with plans to make another one soon) as more of a casual thing to get to know her but after that she drifted apart. Now I do not blame her or anything like that for all I know, something else took her attention, be it family, school, stress, or simply she lost interest or a mix of these things. But I can't help but shake off these past demons like what if I've never changed and that everything I've worked so hard for has been superficial at best, and that deep down I've never grown past the failure I thought I was.",1,1758241178.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Three weeks ago, I went on a work trip. My husband said, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôll stay home, game a little, order pizza.‚Äù He‚Äôs 41. I thought, ‚ÄúFine, he‚Äôs a grown man. What could possibly go wrong?‚Äù

Answer: everything.

Day 2, he decided he was going to be a ‚Äúgrill master.‚Äù Small problem‚Äîwe don‚Äôt own a grill. So he stacked three baking sheets, doused them in lighter fluid, and smoked out the house for 40 minutes. The oven still smells like gasoline.

Then came the TikTok ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù phase. He threw out nearly all our dishes because ‚Äúwe only need one bowl each.‚Äù The bowls he chose? A salad bowl and the dog‚Äôs water dish. Everything else is gone.

His diet? Twenty frozen burritos. By week two, he was eating them half-frozen, claiming it was ‚Äúbasically a cold wrap‚Äù and ‚Äúsaving electricity.‚Äù

Laundry? Nonexistent. He rotated between two pairs of basketball shorts until they turned into something resembling denim armor. The dog growled every time he sat down.

When I came home, he was shirtless, blasting away on a recorder he bought because ‚ÄúMozart slapped.‚Äù The house reeked of melted plastic and ranch dressing.

This morning, I woke up to him whispering in his sleep: ‚ÄúI am the burrito.‚Äù The dog has officially moved into the bathtub.

Sorry in advance for the long post.. 

I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They‚Äôve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus, and I‚Äôd bleed through clothes and pads, would have to use heavy tampons and change them every couple of hours on the heaviest days- still happens now, just not ‚Äúas bad‚Äù. 

I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier. 

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I‚Äôd just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long‚Ä¶ 

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I‚Äôd explained all of these symptoms and problems I‚Äôd been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm ‚Äúpolyp‚Äù was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could‚Äôve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she‚Äôd book this in. 

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that‚Äôs when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. 
Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don‚Äôt think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn‚Äôt resolved at all. 

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I‚Äôd gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc. 
 
______________________________________
Between those dates, I‚Äôd stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I‚Äôm soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she‚Äôd book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time. 

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024). 
 
______________________________________
Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I‚Äôd still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I‚Äôd started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline. 
______________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I‚Äôd been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025. 

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago. 

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn‚Äôt be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn‚Äôt know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn‚Äôt ask many questions. I‚Äôm just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I‚Äôm just sat here thinking the worst. 

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I‚Äôve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I‚Äôm just a bit worried, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just being a hypochondriac, and that I‚Äôve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? 

Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I‚Äôm just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I‚Äôm just back to square one. I‚Äôm in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it‚Äôs endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.  
______________________________________
Relaying back to symptoms etc: 

Since November 2024, I‚Äôd been tracking my ‚Äúperiods‚Äù on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I‚Äôd been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I‚Äôm fixed!!! 

But that was the last proper ‚Äúperiod‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn‚Äôt like a normal period. I didn‚Äôt much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I‚Äôd had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few. 
______________________________________

So in all, I‚Äôm kinda worried it could be any number of things: 

PCOS 
endometriosis
amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia
Hormone imbalance 

Or just absolutely nothing at all?? (kinda thinking this more and more as the years go on. Am I just imagining all this shit and am I just overreacting?) 

I‚Äôm just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I‚Äôm never going to get the answers I‚Äôm looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there‚Äôs a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit. 

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way.

ü©∂ The Haus Labs contour is less gray than I hoped based on the ads + content I've seen online. As you can see, it sheers out to lean more warm and brown.

The applicator stick is a wonderful size + shape for precise application 

ü©∂ Intuition by Rituel de Fille is of course a cult classic for pale skin. It's a beautiful gray shade that remains cool when sheered out. It lives up to the website description: ""a soft gray with a hint of taupe and mauve."" This shade looks the most natural on me, but the texture does require quite a bit of blending. Another note, it has a strong herb and lavender scent, like most products from Rituel de Fille. I don't care for the scent, but worth it for the color 

ü©∂ The Flower Knows liquid contour is a Asia regional exclusive shade, sadly. It's part of their strawberry cupid collection. The shade is a cool gray in a very pigmented formula.

* I'm British so get used to sarcasm sprinkled with lots of dark humour.
* Big Heavy Metal fan. Recent attendee of Bloodstock 2025. Deathcore is where it is at for me but I do have a big playlist of guilty pleasures from all kinds of genres. Can't beat some 80s pop now and then.
* Gym rat in the making. I thought it was about time I started taking care of myself a little better. I'm actually taking this somewhat seriously.
* Very much interested in physics/astronomy/cosmology. It hurts my brain at times but it's fun learning how things work on a deeper level. I'm always up for chatting about any new developments or theories.
* I play video games but not as much as I used to. I'm mostly playing OldSchool RuneScape, Satisfactory and Modded Minecraft at the moment.
* I enjoy having deep thought provoking conversations that tickle the brain, no matter how silly the subject.
* Anime is a favourite of mine although I haven't watched anything new for a while. The last things I watched were AOT, Dragonball Super and One Punch Man. I've been meaning to start One Piece.
* I do like to play a good board game. My recent favourites have been Terraforming Mars, Scythe and Wingspan. I've been on the lookout for a D&D group for years.
* Some other things I like to do are hiking, cycling, swimming and exploring.
* I'm hoping to try rock climbing or bouldering soon. I've also got driving lessons to start.

What I'm looking for in you:

* Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
* Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
* Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
* Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1nkokdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nkokdp/i_stopped_drinking_coffee_first_thing_in_the/,"I stopped drinking coffee first thing in the morning, and it changed way more than my energy","For years, my mornings started with one thought: coffee. I couldn‚Äôt function without it. My brain felt foggy, my mood cranky, and the only ‚Äúsolution‚Äù was to pour another cup.

Then I read about how your body‚Äôs cortisol (your natural wake-up hormone) peaks in the first hour after waking. By drinking coffee immediately, I was basically overriding my body‚Äôs natural rhythm, and setting myself up for energy crashes later.

So I tried something different: water first, light movement (even just stretching), and breakfast before coffee. At first, it felt uncomfortable‚Ä¶ like I was missing my security blanket. But within a week:

My energy stayed steady throughout the day.

I didn‚Äôt get the 2 PM crash.

And wildest of all, I actually enjoyed coffee more, because I wasn‚Äôt desperate for it.

What surprised me most wasn‚Äôt the science. It was realizing how much of my day I spent on autopilot, letting habits run me instead of choosing them.

‚àö Tiny shifts can change way more than you expect.

Curious: has anyone else experimented with changing their morning routine? What‚Äôs the smallest tweak that gave you the biggest result?",7,1758240240.0,getdisciplined,4,0.89,False
1nkok9p,https://i.redd.it/rvyhdyfwi0qf1.jpeg,The Weight of a Day Given,"There are many who give money and many more who wish they could. And there is nothing wrong with that. You give what you have, and if what you have is money, then money will do.

The world is broken in many places and money is a fast way to put a finger in the dam. But there is a kind of giving that does not move so fast. It has no receipt and does not pass through a tax man‚Äôs hands. It cannot be wired or withdrawn or marked as a donation. It is older than money and far more difficult.

*It is the giving of yourself*. Not just your blood or your breath, though some have given that too. I mean the giving of time. Of attention. Of the full weight of your presence.

A man once told me he had given a great deal to a hospital. I asked him what that meant and he told me the number. I nodded. He said it again, a little louder. I nodded again and said I had spent six weeks there once sitting with a boy who did not make it. He asked if I were a relative. I said no. He did not ask anything after that.

There are men who spend their time as if it were ash and others who guard it like gold. But the truth is no one has enough of it, not really, and so to give it freely is no small thing.

You cannot make more of it. You cannot earn it back once it is gone. And still there are people who wake up early to drive others to appointments, who sit beside the bed when someone is dying, who stand in line to serve coffee to people who have no one left to sit across from them at breakfast.

That is giving. That is something that cannot be dropped in a box or swiped on a card.

People talk about meaning as if it were found at the end of some long road, a place you arrive at after collecting the right experiences or books or furniture. But I think it lives closer than that. I think it waits in the quiet moments when you are doing something for someone who cannot pay you back.

Money can buy comfort. It can buy efficiency. It can buy distraction, and it can even buy a kind of beauty. But it cannot sit beside you in your worst hour. It cannot hold your hand. It cannot write a letter or pick up the phone or kneel down beside a child who has dropped their ice cream. Those things take a person. And not just a person, but a willing one.

In the end, I think the ones who matter most are the ones who show up. They don‚Äôt always have a title or a clever thing to say. But they come when they are needed. And they come without a clock in their hand.

It is easy to be generous when it costs nothing. Harder when the cost is your morning, or your pride, or the comfort of your own plans.

But this is where the world is made better. Not in large acts alone, but in small ones done with great effort. A chair carried up the stairs. A conversation held patiently. A meal cooked, not ordered.

Give your money, if you have it. The world needs that too. But give your time if you dare. That is the real currency. And the poor are not the only ones in need of it.

[Join us](https://kommunitykoin.com/)¬†in making the world a better place ‚Äì you‚Äôll be glad that you did. Cheers friends.

But the messages we received were... disturbing.,"My friend found a device that lets you hear God. But the messages we received were‚Ä¶ disturbing.

Ms. Robinson called Tommy out three times during class. He kept opening and closing his notebook, spinning his pen between his fingers, and giving me that grin that said *I‚Äôve got a secret too good to keep*.

‚ÄúI found a device that lets you hear God,‚Äù he told me at lunch, after he finished ranting about how all the teachers sucked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, confused.

He told me he‚Äôd been chatting to people on mysticism forums, and they mailed him this gadget, saying it was a direct line to God‚Äôs voice. The Creator Himself.

I figured it was just another one of Tommy‚Äôs weird obsessions. We were two awkward, chronically online kids, and he had a thing for conspiracy theories.

I laughed and told him he was losing it. That‚Äôs when he dug into his pocket and pulled out the 'thing'.

It looked like a flash drive with a cheap earbud attached. Almost like an old MP3 player I‚Äôd once found in my mom‚Äôs junk box.

‚ÄúMark, this will blow your mind,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúJust put it in your ear for a while when you‚Äôre home. For some reason it doesn‚Äôt always work, but at night it usually kicks in.‚Äù

Then he shoved the device into my hand and told me to bring it back the next day.

That night I went to bed early, feeling like an idiot for even putting the thing in my ear. But it was still better than lying awake listening to my parents fight like they did every night.

I lay there waiting, pretty sure it was all a prank Tommy cooked up to laugh at me in the morning. The device was metal, no labels, no lights, nothing to even prove it was on.

It was only when I was almost asleep that I heard something. A strange static, like a weak radio signal. Like wind blowing into a mic.

That lasted a few minutes, then a low voice started to come through.

It was calm, almost androgynous, barely loud enough to hear. A few lines stood out clear:

*You are my child.*  
*And one day we‚Äôll be together again.*  
*Let my voice guide your way to the light.*

The same lines repeated a few times, and then silence.

The next day Tommy was just as restless in class and got just as many warnings from the teacher. This time because he couldn‚Äôt wait to hear what I thought.

At break I told him I heard it, though I still thought it was nothing special.

He swore it was. Said every night these words were different, new teachings or whatever. He told me his first time had been like mine, but that the voice was saying new things now. He was a few sessions ahead of me.

I asked what it said, and he shook his head. I‚Äôd have to hear it myself.

So we made a deal about the device: one night with him, one night with me.

And sure enough, the messages shifted. Still in that same pleasant, almost hypnotic tone, but the short phrases turned to themes of love, perseverance, and self-acceptance. We started calling them ‚Äúthe lessons,‚Äù and they rarely lasted more than fifteen minutes.

For both of us it turned out to be a pleasant escape. For me, from the endless fights between my parents and their neglect. For Tommy, from the fact that it was clear he was going to fail the year. His grades were a disaster, and he clashed with teachers constantly.

We spent whole classes daydreaming about the voice, and every break trading theories. The truth is, over time we started to believe it could actually be God.

That voice just had this pull and calm that you can‚Äôt really explain to anyone who hasn‚Äôt heard it. I could listen to it for hours.

But all that was before it turned... let‚Äôs say, *aggressive*.

\*\*\*

One day Tommy showed up at school with this serious look. He sat through class quiet and still, which was totally unlike him.

At break he told me he‚Äôd left the device at home and would give it to me the next day. I asked why he seemed so weird.

‚ÄúHe said my name,‚Äù he explained, staring at nothing like he was in a trance. ‚ÄúThe voice said my name and said I was special. That I was a blessing against the unjust.‚Äù

Tommy was still a few lessons ahead of me in what the voice taught, but it had already started talking to me about what it called the 'unjust'. In my last session, it said:

*To the unjust there remains only the blessing of the light.*  
*The good must not merely walk away from them but face them.*

It sounded abstract, and I still had no idea what it meant.

‚ÄúWe were chosen,‚Äù Tommy finally said, grabbing my shoulders. ""He's giving us a path to him.""

He didn‚Äôt come to school the next day, or for the rest of that week. I called, texted, nothing. I wondered how many lessons he had gotten through by then.

I didn‚Äôt hear from him until the following Monday morning. I was half asleep from another night of my parents yelling at each other. When I opened the front door there was a brown paper bag on the porch.

Inside it was the device and a scrap of paper with a handwritten note.

*""hey mark*  
*please don't come to school today*  
*trust me please and remember we were chosen*  
*tommy""*

I didn‚Äôt get it, and tried calling Tommy again with no answer. Still, I felt I could not ignore his warning.

I tucked the thing in my pocket and walked to a local park so my parents wouldn‚Äôt know I was skipping class, not that they would care much.

\*\*\*

It's been two months since the horrible things Tommy did that day.

That morning he came to school very early, while the teachers were drinking coffee and preparing for classes.

Armed with his dad‚Äôs handgun, he opened fire, killing four of them. He emptied an entire magazine into Ms. Robinson.

Then Tommy ended his own life.

The cops, the news, and the whole town still haven't figured out why. People guessed mental health, bullying, politics, all that stuff. The truth is something I keep to myself: I know it was the voice.

I haven't shown anyone his note.

And I still have it with me. The device.

Although I didn‚Äôt have the courage to use it for a few weeks, I actually missed the peace it gave me. I only tried it again last night.

But the voice I heard from it wasn't the one I was used to. It was another one. *Tommy's voice*.

What he said must have lasted a little over a minute, but I'm sure it was him, because he called my name.

*Mark, we were chosen.*  
*The unjust were brought to the light by my hand.*  
*And you must come meet me too.*

Before he finished I ripped the device from my ear and threw it across the room, decided I was hallucinating.

After a few seconds, I regretted it and went to get it. Could it really be my friend?

I slowly put the device on again, and soon the voice returned. Not Tommy's. The other one.

And the last ""lesson"" still haunts me, because I know what it wants from me, and I'm afraid that if I keep listening to it, I'll believe him.

\*\*\*

*You are a blessed being, Mark.*  
*Born and raised to be light.*  
*Your father and mother fell to the path of the unjust.*  
*And it's your duty to do the right thing for them, just like your brother Thomas did.*  
*You are special.*  
*Bring them to the light.*",1,1758240093.0,u_Accomplished_Low7889,0,1.0,False

1nkod51,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1nkod51/28_m4f_east_london_looking_for_a_genuine/,28 [M4F] East London - Looking for a genuine connection,"Hi everyone,

My name is Usman Ali, I‚Äôm 28, and I live in East London. I originally moved to the UK two years ago to pursue my master‚Äôs degree in Data Science at the University of Greenwich. Since then, I‚Äôve stayed on and am currently working as a security supervisor while actively looking for a role in tech.

Even after two years, London still feels a little foreign to me. I‚Äôm naturally a shy guy ‚Äî I find it hard to start conversations and can barely hold eye contact without panicking üôà. But deep down, I‚Äôm kind, loyal, and genuinely looking for a meaningful connection with someone.

I‚Äôve tried the usual dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble), but they never really worked for me. So here I am, hoping to meet someone who appreciates sincerity over smooth talk.

A little more about me:

	‚Ä¢	I enjoy learning new things, especially anything tech-related

	‚Ä¢	I love exploring different parts of London, though I‚Äôm still new to the city

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm more of a quiet listener than a talker, but I open up once I feel comfortable

	‚Ä¢	Looking for someone who‚Äôs kind, patient, and genuine

If you‚Äôd like to grab a coffee, go for a walk, or just chat and get to know each other, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. üòä

Thanks for reading, and wishing everyone here the best of luck in finding their person!

(We have separate bedrooms) I have had a male partner for 20 yrs+. She gets increasing jealous over me, especially when I'm with my BF or kids. Last week I went to my Daughters to go bingo and my fella went to play PlayStation with her BF, we got bk to my Daughters and had a few coffees and I had a shower, got a txt off (sister) aka where was I. Got no she was sat on her bed and I said hello and we was bk, IGNORED!! She screamed at me me asking why I had brought that 'useless ballbag' with me and then decided to square upto my partner and when he wouldn't take her on she (VERY DRUNK) SWUNG at my me twice after me asking her 10+ times to leave my bedroom, I'm ashamed to say I punched her in the face. She left soon after to go bk to her mouldy ridden nasty flat. That was last Saturday, she apologised on Tuesday and said she could stay as long as we put proper rules down. My BF laughed at her apology as it's not the first time shes done this... √ó15!! Her flat is a hell hole, the landlord won't do anything about it and I feel bad if I have to to put her bk in that situation. What do you all think? I don't live with my BF cos of personal reasons, But I really need your thoughts on this. TIA x",1,1758239609.0,stupidtwat,0,1.0,False

I need some advice,"Somewhere at the beginning of summer, when I went to bed, I often heard mosquitoes right next to my head. Sometimes I found a real mosquito, and sometimes I couldn't find anyone and covered myself with a blanket. It didn't really bother me then, ‚Äòcause it was hot and mosquitoes were typical of appearances in the apartment.

But now. A week ago I got an ordinary ARVI and three days ago I heard a mosquito again when I went to bed. I started tossing and waving, running away with my hand. But nothing helped. I somehow fell asleep, thinking that a mosquito was pranking me. But the day after, when I went to bed, something clicked in me and I realized that there were no fckin mosquitoes in my room. In complete silence, I hear a high-frequency mosquito squeak. When I realized it, a second later I thought I was crazy. I started crying and googled what it was with trembling hands. And I got it. I have a tinnitus. Not only that, now I hear not only 'mosquito squeak' in the silence, but also a ringing. A half-deaf ringing, like from a flash in CS-GO.

It's just terrible. I hate it. I want to scream. I'm a person who always falls asleep quickly in silence, now I'm suffering in headphones trying to fall asleep to Mac Miller. The day before yesterday I spent 5 hours to fall asleep. I don't want to comment on it.

I want to clarify something else: I often take ibuprofen (for migraines and pain). And the last time I took it was when ARVI started (on the same day when I heard 'a mosquito' after a long time).

I've been acting paranoid for the third day. I go to the toilet - these noises (a mosquito and ringing), which is why I have to turn on the ventilation. I'm looking for a YouTube video in silence - noise. I'm pouring coffee - noises.

I've cried so many times, remembering literally the recent days when I was an ordinary girl. I don't want to whine or cry, but I have nowhere to pour it out.

Before I got sick, I celebrated my birthday. I couldn't even imagine that everything would turn out like this. My God.

Please give me some advice. What should be done, what is not worth it. I already want it all to end. Judging by the experience of people, what they write here, it can easily stay for life. This thought makes me cry.

EDIT: I pray that it will pass. I don't know how and when it can pass. But in these three days there hasn't been a single hour without it. Is there any chance that it will pass? Why could it even appear?",2,1758239376.0,tinnitus,4,1.0,False

I am looking for literally any and all suggestions anyone might have on what‚Äôs wrong with me. I feel like I am doing all the right things and yet my symptoms persist

Long story short, April 2024 I tested positive for H.Pylori. Completed round of antibiotics, then tested negative. Symptom of bad breath persisted and new symptom of altered mouth taste arose in June 2024. Saw my doctor several times, we did a lot of different blood tests, other H.pylori tests (all negative), gastroscopy, saw an ENT, had my fillings removed that were put in in May 2024 incase they were the cause, all of which didn't improve the symptoms

After numerous doctor and specialist visits, all who couldn‚Äôt help me or told me this was all in my head, I went to a naturopath in May 2025. We did a GI Map test and the results are in the photos.

Since then, she put me on a treatment protocol which involved changing my diet and adding in supplements.¬†

The supplements she has me taking daily are:¬†

* Partially hydrolysed guar gum
* 2x [OmegAvail](https://betahealth.com.au/products/dfh-omegavail-1250?_pos=1&_sid=579dc904b&_ss=r) (fish oil)
* 2x [IntestaSelect](https://betahealth.com.au/products/orthoplex-intestaselect?srsltid=AfmBOorZa0xRe1bZmQpZwstwRDVIkQKb9yAv7aJcx58p69jmSD-y9mH1) (pomegranate, caraway, garlic, black seed extract)
* 1x [Gut-R ](https://betahealth.com.au/products/orthoplex-gut-r?_pos=5&_sid=2f00bb72f&_ss=r)(glutamine and zinc carnosine)¬†
* 2x Floramyces (500 mg Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Boulardii))
* 1x Lifespaces [Probiotic](https://www.nationalpharmacies.com.au/product/life-space-broad-spectrum-probiotic-30-pack/?srsltid=AfmBOooAvJvHe12jPer6-Kt83wu-j_oS-alOEWK0Q9GOATn6Eti5nUhD)¬†

She has me eating resistant starches (cooked and cooled rice or potatoes) and polyphenol rich foods (green tea, berries, nuts, seeds) to help reestablish the low bacteroidetes, lactobacillus and f. prausnitzii as well as repairing my gut lining.

I do not eat meat or dairy, haven‚Äôt for 7 years. My new diet is only whole foods, nothing processed (inc. bread, pasta, etc) and no sugar at all. Basically, all I eat is fruit, vegetables, lentils, chickpeas, beans, rice, quinoa, oats, tea, coffee, nuts, seeds, kefir, fermented vegetables and yoghurt. The only processed food I eat is protein powder (brand I use is a mix of Pea Protein, Fava Bean Protein, Rice Protein)

Symptoms still persist with no improvement, I am at my wit‚Äôs end with this because it is ruining my life¬†

Other notes:

* I don‚Äôt drink or smoke
* Regular medication is iron and b12, have switched brands over the 1.5 years with no improvement
* Altered taste is not there when I eat and doesn‚Äôt change the taste of food
* My dental health is perfect, my dentist is also at a loss about these symptoms
* No foods seem to make the taste worse, other than sugar which significantly worsens it
* No other symptoms such as heartburn or bloating
* When I've taken the antibiotics, the bad breath goes away but the mouth taste does not
* The taste is hard to describe, and because I've had it for so long it's hard to know what normal taste is like, but sometimes it feels like my tongue is burnt, sometimes it tastes metallic, sometimes it tastes sour

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Flamengo vs. Estudiantes de La Plata: A Copa Libertadores Clash of Titans (and Underdogs Who Need a Miracle)**

The Copa Libertadores returns to the Maracan√£, where legends are born and tourists from La Plata come to‚Ä¶ well, hope for a miracle. Flamengo, Brazil‚Äôs invincible (or nearly invincible) giants, host Estudiantes de La Plata in the quarterfinals, and the odds make this as lopsided as a churro dipped in coffee. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a Brazilian samba instructor and the humor of a fan who‚Äôs seen too many last-minute own goals.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Flamengo‚Äôs Implied Probability is ‚Äú basically 100% (Minus the Vig)

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Flamengo like a *rod√≠zio* of confetti. At decimal odds of 1.3 to 1.34 (American: -150 to -125), the implied probability of a Flamengo win ranges from **74.6% to 76.9%**. For context, that‚Äôs the statistical likelihood of a Brazilian footballer pronouncing ‚ÄúMaracan√£‚Äù without a laugh track. Estudiantes, at 11.0 to 11.5 (7.0% to 8.7%), are priced as the underdog equivalent of a tourist trying to order *feijoada* in Portuguese‚Äîdesperately hopeful, but statistically doomed.

The draw? A 21.7% chance (odds: 4.6 to 4.9). Given Flamengo‚Äôs nine-game unbeaten streak and Estudiantes‚Äô two consecutive domestic losses, this feels like the chance of your uncle finally learning to juggle coconuts‚Ä¶ but only during a family reunion.

### **Digesting the News: Flamengo‚Äôs Unstoppable Streak vs. Estudiantes‚Äô ‚ÄúNever Won in Rio‚Äù Curse

Flamengo enters this clash as Brazil‚Äôs Serie A leaders, having steamrolled Internacional 3-0 in the previous round. Their nine-game unbeaten run since July? A masterclass in dominance that makes a *caipirinha* look weak. Key players like Arrascaeta and Pedro are in form, and coach Filipe Lu√≠s has turned the Maracan√£ into a fortress‚ÄîEstudiantes have never won a single official match in Rio. Ever. Their last meeting in 1994? A 2-0 Estudiantes win, but that was *29 years ago*. Time enough for a generation of Estudiantes fans to forget how to celebrate.

Meanwhile, Estudiantes are a team in transition. Coac

**The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks‚Äô dress code violates Colorado law, which prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent**

tarbucks workers in three states, including Colorado, took legal action against the coffee giant Wednesday, saying it violated the law when it¬†[changed its dress code](https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-dress-code-black-shirt-union-b7dd93b93c6c13448606545fb3f1778f)¬†but refused to reimburse employees who had to buy new clothes.

The employees, who are backed by the¬†[union organizing Starbucks‚Äô workers](https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-union-workers-united-ef16b24b20d43a6addadf91c0067bd28), filed class-action lawsuits in state court in Illinois and Colorado. Workers also filed complaints with California‚Äôs Labor and Workforce Development Agency. If the agency decides not to seek penalties against Starbucks, the workers intend to file a class-action lawsuit in California, according to the complaints.

Starbucks didn‚Äôt comment directly on the lawsuits Wednesday, but the company said it simplified its dress code to deliver a more consistent experience to customers and give its employees clearer guidance.

‚ÄúAs part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,‚Äù the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as ‚Äúpartners.‚Äù

Starbucks‚Äô new dress code went into effect on May 12. It requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.

Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be ‚Äúsubdued,‚Äù the company said.

The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and ‚Äútheatrical makeup‚Äù are also prohibited.

Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees‚Äô green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a¬†[warmer, more welcoming experience](https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-ceo-niccol-coffee-b547ab2141e194b30675ad8d1caff90d)¬†in its stores.

Before the new dress code went into effect, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.

The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don‚Äôt comply aren‚Äôt allowed to start their shifts.

Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn‚Äôt meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair that cost her $60.09.

Allen has spent an additional $86.95 on clothes for work, including black shirts and jeans.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs extremely tone deaf on the company‚Äôs part to expect their employees to completely redesign their wardrobe without any compensation,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúA lot of us are already living paycheck to paycheck.‚Äù

Allen said she misses the old dress code, which allowed her to express herself with colorful shirts and three facial piercings.

‚ÄúIt looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,‚Äù she said.

The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks‚Äô dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.

Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.

Worker-led lawsuits in state courts are a shift in tactics in the multi-year effort to¬†[unionize Starbucks‚Äô stores](https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-strike-baristas-workers-united-7b2f6e5d7b039bc1909d646d84cd426d).

Starbucks Workers United, the labor group that has unionized 640 of Starbucks‚Äô 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores, has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board. The union filed an charge over the dress code in April but it is not a party in the current lawsuits.

But the board‚Äôs ability to hear cases has been curtailed under President Donald Trump. Trump¬†[fired an NLRB member](https://apnews.com/article/trump-board-members-firings-nlrb-supreme-court-1ecda00f901360cc2b2f025bdde703d6)¬†in the spring, leaving the board without the quorum it needs to decide cases.""",8,1758238967.0,stupidpol,2,1.0,False

Last year, I was rushing between meetings in Bahrain Bay‚Äîwatching the golden light play off the towers of the Bahrain Financial Harbour and smelling cardamom-infused coffee wafting from a nearby majlis. I'd just helped a client open a fintech office in Seef District, and was headed to a consultancy registration in the Diplomatic Area. The buzz was relentless, yet every district demanded a different approach‚Äîespecially when it came to office requirements.\

Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals in Bahrain., Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil sector is projected to grow 5.7% in 2025, outpacing many Gulf neighbors. Forbes just ranked Manama among the ‚ÄúTop 10 Most Dynamic Business Cities‚Äù in MENA for 2025, citing record foreign direct investment and a wave of new digital ventures.\
\
Bahrain has transformed itself into a regional powerhouse for fintech, logistics, and professional services‚Äîlargely due to reforms around company formation and foreign ownership.\
\
But here‚Äôs what trips up many investors: Certain business activities in Bahrain do require specific office standards. And making a mistake here can delay everything, from Commercial Registration (CR) approval to bank account setup‚Äîeven causing hefty compliance penalties.\
(I learned this the hard way one Ramadan, when a missed document nearly derailed our launch plans. More on that mishap‚Äîand how to dodge similar issues‚Äîbelow.)\
Why Do Office Standards Matter in Bahrain Company Formation?\
\
Regulatory compliance: The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) and Sijilat platform enforce strict rules for offices, especially for regulated activities (financial services, consultancies, medical, etc.).\
Commercial credibility: Bankers, clients, and partners judge your business location and fit-out.\
Staff welfare and productivity: The right space helps with LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) requirements for visas and staff quotas.\
Cost optimization: Choosing the wrong setup can drain your budget‚Äîespecially with soaring rents in prime areas.\

Bahrain‚Äôs Distinct Business Districts: Office Standards by Activity\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Financial Harbour at sunset.\
- Prestige location impacts relationship-building (local custom: majlis-style introductions matter)\
Budget Tip: Co-working offices in Harbour Gate start at BHD 180/month all-inclusive‚Äîskip the full lease until you hit operational scale.\
Seef District: Tech Startups, E-commerce, Back-Office Operations\
\
Shared office (co-working) allowed for many activities, especially if 100% online\
For IT, digital agencies, and eCommerce, virtual office with ‚Äòdesk tenancy‚Äô is often acceptable for initial CR‚Äîprovided you have physical mailbox and local phone\
E-commerce businesses must provide evidence of a Bahrain-based physical address but not always a private office\
\
\
Ramadan Note: Business hours may shorten, but government counters open early. Arrive by 7:30am to avoid Sijilat queues.\
\
Diplomatic Area: Law, Accounting, International Representative Offices\
\
Activities like legal practice or accounting require a dedicated, lockable space (3-year lease minimum)\
The office must have signage, reception, and secure file storage for compliance\
Some free zone entities can use flexi-desk options if licensed under EDB (Economic Development Board) incentives\
\
Details on Bahrain business structures can be found here.\
2025 Regulatory Update: MOICT Office Standard Overhaul\
Importantly, from March 2025, MOICT raised the bar for physical office requirements for all new Commercial Registrations in ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù sectors:\
\
All financial service providers must submit geo-tagged office photos and digital floorplans with lease contracts\
E-Commerce and virtual businesses now must show at least 6-month tenancy (previously 3 was sufficient)\
Co-working and serviced office tenants must register tenancy contracts directly with Sijilat‚Äôs online portal‚Äînot just via landlord (my personal tip: upload all paperwork in PDF, signed & stamped, to avoid the dreaded ‚Äúpending‚Äù status)\
\
Check official updates on the MOICT website.\
Ownership Structure & Office Requirements: What‚Äôs the Link?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a professional boardroom.**, S.P.C. (Single Person), or Branch of Foreign Company, your office obligations can change‚Äîespecially regarding foreign shareholding.\
\
100% foreign-owned entities: Stricter office vetting, particularly for regulated/consultancy/finance sectors\
Local partner or sponsorship: Sometimes more flexibility, especially in traditional trades or smaller offices\
Free zones (e.g., Bahrain Logistics Zone, BCCI Business Incubator): Flexi-desk often accepted for logistics or digital startups\

Step-By-Step Office Setup: Insider‚Äôs Cheat Sheet\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: preparing paperwork in a modern Bahrain office.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs activity codes are sometimes vague. Use official ministry categories, but double-check with MOICT helpdesk if unsure‚Äîwrong code = delays.\
For consulting, IT, and specialized services: check for any new 2025 activity restrictions.\
\
Step 2: Choose Location‚ÄîTiming Is Everything\
\
Best districts by activity:\
Bahrain Financial Harbour/Bay: finance, consulting, regional HQ\
Seef: tech, e-commerce, marketing, and startups (many flexible office solutions)\
Diplomatic Area: law, accounting, embassy support firms\
Muharraq/Industrial Areas: logistics, trading, manufacturing (cheaper but basic)\
Money-saving tip: Visit offices on a Wednesday morning‚Äîmost landlords offer ‚Äúmidweek discounts‚Äù to fill inventory before Friday (local weekend).\
\
Step 3: Prepare Documents\
\
Passport/ID of all shareholders\
Draft lease contract (get electronic copy in both Arabic and English)\
Digital office photos (desk, reception, conference room‚ÄîMOICT now wants timestamp)\

Crunching the Numbers: Office Setup Costs in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.: BHD 180‚Äì400/month\
- Dedicated office (Seef): BHD 300‚Äì750/month (10‚Äì25 sq.m.)\
- Diplomatic Area, premium floor: BHD 500‚Äì1200/month (often 2‚Äì3 year lease, paid quarterly)\
- Co-working/Flexi-desk: BHD 120‚Äì200/month (evidence of physical desk required)\
- Municipality inspection & CR registration:** BHD 25‚Äì75 (depending on activity)\

Common mistake: Many first-timers skip the ‚Äúmunicipality license‚Äù step, thinking CR registration is enough. Wrong! Always ensure your office lease is both Sijilat- and municipality-approved, or risk a last-minute rejection (my personal bruiser, Mekki Tower 2021‚Äîfixed by hand-delivering the lease during a majlis meeting with the building manager).\

Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: The Office Requirement Advantage\
Just a quick sidebar‚Äîwhen I first set up in Dubai‚Äôs DIFC, the sheer paperwork (including 12 stamped originals per lease!) and minimum 200 sq.ft. rule were a headache. In Riyadh, you can face longer background vetting. Bahrain‚Äôs process, by contrast, is faster and more straightforward‚Äîeven with the 2025 documentation upgrades.\
\
Bahrain remains the Gulf‚Äôs most flexible jurisdiction for small service firms and startups‚Äîespecially in the Seef and Bahrain Bay corridors.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Office Standards for Company Formation\
1. What activities require a physical office vs. virtual?\
Short answer: Finance, insurance, legal, and licensed consultancy must have dedicated space. E-commerce and many digital/IT businesses can launch with a virtual office or co-working desk, but must provide lease and address. Always confirm with Sijilat‚Äôs latest matrix.\
2. Can I use a home office for my Bahrain CR?\
Generally not. Home addresses are not approved except for select ‚Äúmicrobusiness‚Äù activities (subject to strict inspection and usually for Bahraini nationals only). Stick to serviced or co-working offices for lowest hassle.\
3. What are the hidden costs of office compliance?\
\
Municipality inspection fees (BHD 25‚Äì45)\
Deposit (usually 1‚Äì3 months‚Äô rent)\
Signage/branding (BHD 80‚Äì200)\
Fire/safety certification (in some towers)\
Time cost of multiple site visits‚Äîavoid by using a local formation consultant\
\
Keylink breaks down all major fees and budgeting tips.\
4. Is there a fast-track or ‚Äúexpress‚Äù CR/office approval?\
Yes! Use the Sijilat ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù option‚Äîpay a premium (BHD 120‚Äì200 extra) for 3‚Äì5 day processing, but only available for pre-vetted serviced office addresses in Manama and Seef. Insider tip: Submitting all documents in a single PDF file gets prioritized.\
5. Are free zones a smart alternative for office savings?\
Often, yes. Bahrain Logistics Zone and BCCI Incubator offer ‚Äúflexi-desk‚Äù packages, but these only suit certain business types (mainly logistics and tech startups). Always check activity eligibility. More on Bahrain‚Äôs free zones here.\

1nko0qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1nko0qj/smartwatches_and_the_age_of_covid/,Smartwatches and the Age of COVID,"So, this is not a sponsored post or meant to be an endorsement of Apple or Apple Watches, but I needed to share how my Apple Watch basically saved my life this week. This is a LONG post, but I think it‚Äôs worth it. 

As a member of the COVID conscious community, I limit my outside activities and most social interaction, so I‚Äôm alone 99% of the time. I‚Äôve also worked from home for the past 12 years and have adopted many habits that allow me to not have to leave my house much. Until yesterday, I hadn‚Äôt left my house in over a week and a half, thinking it was attributable to general depression, frustration, and disappointment with the state of the country and the world, you know? I‚Äôd been tired and just sort of couch-surfing more often, not even caring to use my treadmill like I normally would to maintain good health. 

Well, a couple of days ago, my watch first sent me a notification to check my vitals because my heart rate while sleeping was high. I normally have a pretty good resting heart rate (ranging from about 59-71 depending on my ovulation and menstrual cycle) and stellar blood pressure. So, when the notification alerted me that my heart rate while sleeping was 78 BPM, I thought surely that was an error or maybe just an off night since I‚Äôd not been sleeping well lately. The next morning, however, I got another vitals notification, this time showing my heart rate and respiratory rate were high. But again, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it since I‚Äôd only gotten about 5.5 hours of sleep and was groggy and super tired. 

I clocked in and started working from my home office, though knew I felt a bit sluggish. About an hour & a half after starting working though, I checked my heart rate on my watch, and it showed 106 BPM while I was just sitting at my desk! I still didn‚Äôt panic though and thought that maybe my huge, 22 ounce cup of coffee was the culprit or something. But, out of an abundance of caution, I informed my boss that I was going to just take a 2-hour break to try to get my heart rate down and tried that. Thankfully, my mother came over to sit with me because despite just relaxing outside for a few minutes, relaxing on my couch, and even drinking lemon balm tea, my heart rate wouldn‚Äôt drop below 100 BPM. So, at my mother‚Äôs urging, I finally agreed to take the rest of the day off and head to the ER. 

Upon arriving at the ER, I expected a long wait time, as that‚Äôs fairly typical in my area. After just giving them my name and SSN, however, I was triaged where they took my blood pressure, temperature (I unknowingly had a fever of 100.5¬∞), and heart rate, all of which caused them to take me to the back for an EKG immediately. Since I was also a little lightheaded and winded from really no activity at all, they then took me in a wheelchair to a room right afterwards. 

I spent about 6-7 hours in the ER, where they did a full blood panel, urinalysis, a nasal swab to check for respiratory infections, a chest x-ray, and both a chest CT and abdominal CT with contrast. Thankfully, no COVID was detected, but I was found to have developed sepsis from diverticulitis of all things! I was given intravenous fluids for dehydration, 2 antibiotics intravenously, Tylenol, and also eventually sent home with an additional antibiotic prescription to take with stern orders to follow up with my PCP in 2 days to see that I was improving or to immediately come back to the ER if I got worse. 

So, that was a super long story to point out that I would have never gone to the doctor or the ER had my watch not notified me of outliers in my vitals. I was sure that I was fine but just tired or burnt out on the state of the world and definitely didn‚Äôt want to put myself at risk by going to a hospital lol. The hospital staff were wonderful, however. None of my caregivers were masked, despite me having my N95 mask on the entire time, but they took such great care of me. So, even if you‚Äôre not a fan of Apple or their watches, please get a smartwatch that will notify you about your health data because, had I waited even about a day longer, I would‚Äôve needed to be hospitalized or possibly even just died. So‚Ä¶yea. ",27,1758238756.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,5,1.0,False

I had an old friend from my first college and we decided to hang out. After the first night, I was like this isn‚Äôt my friend. He changed a lot, and I was very understanding of that and I did not brush him or made him feel like I‚Äôm judging him or something. Obviously he know he used to do better for himself without mentioning what he was doing during the time we met.  anyway I decided to be a good friend and keep it up with him and try to help him from whatever he needs help with. The next day he called me two times so I called him back when I woken up and we decided to have a coffee together and again he was not normal. He wasn‚Äôt himself. He was everywhere and not at the moment at the same time, not respecting me not respecting me at all. You know when someone don‚Äôt have a problem losing you and how that feels like it doesn‚Äôt matter to him and you respect him a lot and you had good time together before and you‚Äôre still trying to give him a chance and excuses just to feel like maybe maybe there‚Äôs a bit of hope that he would recognize how selfish she was. Anyway, that was a straw that broke the caramel back. I went to his walk with him so he can put his fingerprints to sign out and I know all his friends would not do that with him. I was trying to show him that I‚Äôm still your close friend even though you have lots of fake friends around you and I can feel how fake they are from a mile away and something tells me that he also know, but he needs them for certain reasons which I don‚Äôt wanna mention. So he said we‚Äôre having people someone‚Äôs gonna come at my home and my family have traveled away. Would you help me clean up my place and I was like for sure I would help you. Then he sent their maids and I was working with his maid, carrying the heavy stuff away from her because the place was very messy and I couldn‚Äôt just watch her clean all that mess so I started gathering stuff and picking up dirty cub, and throwing the garbage out till she was Able to mop then I went to. I moved to sofas although he did not help with any of that, he was on the phone all the time. Doing his business, which is I‚Äôm not gonna answer interfere with it. Then he said I‚Äôm gonna shower you go shower and come back. So I showered, and I came back with the best intention. I saw two cars parking in front of his home that weren‚Äôt there when I left so I tried to go and the door was locked. I called him 10 times and I can hear his voice inside and he wasn‚Äôt answering his phone and I can hear her laughs and jokes crack But still no one‚Äôs answering the phone at this moment I start to feel it and I felt so sad and lonely for a second then I told myself you shouldn‚Äôt be out of place where no one likes you or wants you at that moment he answered his phone and he said something that I would‚Äôve never said it as an excuse and nobody else would‚Äôve said it as an excuse And this is the worst worst worst worst part he replied to me and he said oh my gosh, I didn‚Äôt see the phone. I‚Äôll be out in a second and the second 10 minutes and the 10 minutes to 30 so that moment I felt bad for myself. I‚Äôm not gonna lie but then I just turned the car and drove to my place And now I‚Äôm feeling so bad. I just had to share it. It‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs burning my chest.

This is at least the 5th item from eBay, Poshmark, or Facebook resale groups with undisclosed stains. At least ThredUp is hassle free with returns and refunds.  One poshmark seller accused me of lying and this seller probably will too given I took so long to notice. (But I decided to file for a return anyway because why should I have to deal with it? )

One Poshmark item, I didn‚Äôt notice the stain until way too late. Also, my idea of excellent condition clearly differs from that of most Poshmark sellers. Again, TU lets some crap slip through for sure - but the returns are so much easier

My name is TV-04, also known as Energized TV Man, I am an elite unit of the TV Men race, the invasion of the astro toilets have caused the alliance to ‚Äúteam‚Äù up with the toilets, forming a union. I was in the TV Men base, watching Titan TV Man and Scientist TV Man have a discussion, the large tv on the wall went into the POV of a Cameraman at the Cameramen base.

POV Location: Auckland Islands, New Zealand, Cameraman Base.
 
The POV-Cameraman watched over the entrance of the Cameramen Base, watching various agents leave the base, including a Work in Progress Large Cameraman 3.0, having a blue camera, a advanced jetpack, and a handheld blaster taken from a Astro Specialist. The POV turned around, past a Camera Strider 2.0, and a Plasma Tank. A ton of Skibidi Toilets were coming towards the base, some scientists discussing with some Cameramen Scientists, they were coming in peace, not to attack, I thought the Cameramen would attack the toilets but they didnt? Just then a arm came in front of the POV‚Äôs camera. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù A voice said, The POV turned to his side to see a Female Mutant with a set of four claws on her back, a orange visor on her helmet, and two astro laser cannons on her shoulders, the toilets were also taking samples. ‚ÄúYour friends‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said, pointing to her right, two toilets came down carrying containers. ‚ÄúYou did not bother saving them‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said as the containers opened, revealing tons of the fodder cameramen and speakermen. ‚ÄúWithout our help, they would die‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said before grabbing the POV. ‚ÄúNow, lil bro‚Ä¶ your base.. is OUR base‚Ä¶‚Äù she said with a smiling face. The POV then began to change. ‚ÄúDumb bitch!‚Äù Polycephaly yelled as the POV changed. ‚ÄúWhy are we allying with the shitheads?! Are we this desperate?‚Äù The POV changed to Khabarovsk, Russia, where a group of cameramen and toilets were hiding in the destroyed city. A Astro Obliterator and a Astro Trooper raced by, not noticing the POV. ‚ÄúThis is necessary, if we want to survive..‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV looked forward, seeing a Cameraman wearing a sweater ‚Äúdrink‚Äù vodka whilst sitting next to a toilet wearing a hat that had a laser cannon mounted on one of his arms. The Cameraman threw the bottle of vodka to the side whilst standing up, preparing his laser cannon, so did the toilet. ‚ÄúWe must organize a meeting with their hiding leader.‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said, the POV readied his laser cannon as a Astro Troop noticed them, the POV then changed once more. ‚ÄúHe knows something that can help us‚Ä¶‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV changed to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Where the Astro Toilets were destroying the city, agents were running in all directions alongside toilets. ‚ÄúTHE ONLY THING I‚ÄôM ORGANIZING IS HIS FUNERAL, HOW CAN YOU TRUST HIM?!‚Äù Titan TV Man roared as the POV ran through some smoke, the POV then changed yet again to Birmingham, United Kingdom, where a Cameraman was mourning his dead brother, walking back with his paralyzer laser rifle in his hands, dead agents, toilets, and even a astro trooper all around. ‚ÄúAfter all the Genocide‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the POV turned to face the sky. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen what the invaders can do‚Ä¶ their weakest units.. wipe out entire legions.‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV faced back down and began walking towards a garage, dead agents all around. ‚ÄúThey kill everything in their way‚Ä¶ do you think we have a choice‚Ä¶‚Äù Scientist TV Man said, just then, a orange glow emerged from the garage, the POV prepared to fire, but the glow disappeared, he fired into the garage, to no avail, a noise coming from the POV‚Äôs right, he looked right, the Astro Specialist emerging, ripping him in half, the POV laid on the ground, looking up at the sky. The POV began to change once more. ‚ÄúWe do‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said, the POV changing to Osaka, Japan. The POV looking up at a roof top where a Samurai Cameraman stood, carrying a blue plasma tipped blade. The POV began to look down. ‚ÄúAcquire bigger samples‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said, The POV looking at various upgraded troops developed in Japan, including a toilet. ‚ÄúDevelop stronger upgrades..‚Äù Titan TV Man said. ‚ÄúJust like before‚Ä¶‚Äù The POV watched as a Large Cameraman ripped off a Astro blaster off of the corpse of a dead astro troop, the POV turned around into the alleys of Osaka, fire all around, the POV looked behind him, more fire. ‚ÄúThis is not just like before.. the Scientist TV Man said, a Astro Troop appearing, facing away from the POV, the POV pulled out his own blaster, firing it directly at the Astro Troop as the POV changed to just above our base in Alaska, a Cameraman making it there. ‚ÄúOur advantage is being underground, in secrecy, but we have to be cautious and slow‚Ä¶ If they find us, access our technology.. this will be the end of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù the Scientist TV Man said, the POV changing to Halifax, Canada. The POV looking up to see a Astro Impactor, Destructor, and Obliterator destroying the city. ‚ÄúOUR WORLD HAS ALREADY ENDED‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the Obliterator noticed the POV, the POV changing once more, to Denver, USA, where the work in progress Cameramen 3.0 were killing various fodder astro toilets, seemingly with ease. The Normal agents welding blasters similar to the Astro Troops, the POV faced foward, seeing multiple Camera Striders, Plasma Tanks, and Orbital Cameras marching forward. ‚ÄúTHAT IS NOT ENOUGH POWER. THEY‚ÄôVE LOST THEIR GUIDANCE‚Ä¶ MARCHING TO THEIR IMMINENT DEATH.‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the TV cut off, I zoomed my portable Camera out, I turned to Titan TV Man, who turned the TV off with his remote, the newly upgraded Polycephaly standing on a platform above, Titan TV Man changed his tv‚Äôs emoticons to a ‚Äú>:(‚Äú face. ‚ÄúARE WE GOING TO STAY, AND WATCH THEM DIE??‚Äù He roared. ‚ÄúIt takes sacrifice to achieve progress‚Ä¶‚Äù the Scientist TV Man said with a ‚Äú-_-‚Äú face, ‚Äúdrinking‚Äù coffee whilst TV-07, also known as Larry, stood beside him. ‚ÄúBetter safe than sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù the scientist said. ‚ÄúI learned it the hard way‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYOU IMBECILE!!!‚Äù Titan TV Man roared as he lowered down towards the scientist. ‚ÄúSOON NO PLACE WILL BE SAFE!‚Äù Titan TV Man continued. ‚ÄúThe Speakermen were preparing their armada this entire time.‚Äù Scientist said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll come‚Ä¶ just give them time!

My debut mlm novel is now available for review through Booksprout or purchase through Barnes and Noble. I will include those links at the end of this post!

There are two sides of every story. These are the two sides of falling in love. Side A is a ballad, an ode to a love lost, never had, and forgotten. It is a story that many are familiar with. It is thinking someone is a harbor when they are actually the storm.

And this is the story of what came after. This is Side B.

This is a story about unlearning the history of a wound while discovering what healing can be if you let it. It's about flipping the tape over and finding a song you never knew your heart could sing. It's about hope.

I have always lived in a gray area when it comes to gender and sexuality. I have always written as a side hobby, but I wanted to explore the idea of unrequited love (towards a close friend), but also of hope and growth. I always see the world through such negativity, but I want to communicate the hope that is everlasting, a flame that we have to stoke. I wanted my characters to come across as mostly neutral in how they are perceived. There are obvious calls to it being two people with similar gender identities. I use gendered terms as experienced by the main character, not through intention of gendering my character.

This idea came to me because my sisters and I create stories together. We are often world-building and making up characters. I have to thank them for this brainchild. I needed a dive to get me into the writing world. I am scared of marketing. I'm socially awkward and frightened to commit. I never wanted to see my ideas become tangible because then I can't edit it any longer, but I'm happy with this story. I owe it to my little sisters.

Staff turn over is common and some staff I don't work with often due to different hours etc. The other day I ended up on a shift with another member of staff I haven't really met before and definitely hadn't spoken to in person. I'm a food runner whereas the other staff was on the bar. I was clearing up from breakfast and then was straight into lunch rush so was thrown into it on my first hour and was trying to keep up. I don't remember not being busy with something whether it was serving a customer or clearing a table or sorting out a coffee machine. 

My friend starts her shift an hour into mine and she comes over to tell me that the staff member I had one conversation with had commented 'isn't the girl on floor working really slow'. I will admit that has sent me on a spiral about what she could have meant. I don't judge people quickly as I'm introverted and generally take time with my firdt impression to feel comfortable wround new people. 

It feels uncomfortable to have someone say something on my work itself. If I had been slacking off and not really trying then I might not have cared but I was doing something the whole time. My friend didn't ask her to clarify what she meant just told her that she was my friend and she could see I was busy and ended it there. 

Rationally I know it's probably just a misconception of times she saw me as she was was working or just a off-hand comment because she hasn't worked with me before. But my mind is spirally that it could have been a meaner comment and I'll never really know what she meant. 

I've had previous staff comment on my weight before and maybe an insecure part of me is anxious it's related to that or my fitness.

Exactly 2 years ago when I was very stressed, I suddenly developed Graves Disease and had crazy bloods, positive nuclear scan. I had to take beta blockers and Carbimazole for a few months but then I went hypothyroid instead so I had to stop the meds. Ever since then the thyroid has been fine/in remission and I didn't even need Carbimazole.

Ever since then, I've had issues with MCAS and other autoimmune diseases like Sjogrens etc. But recently I have started having issues with my hormones such as PMDD, low estrogen symptoms, hypoglycemia episodes (sugars dropping within 60 minutes of eating), weight loss, serious anxiety, feeling like I've had 10 shots of coffee, fatigue, joint pain, night sweats, and extreme hunger. I have been needing to eat massive amounts of food and everyone's been very confused as to why this has been happening, especially with my sugars dropping to 4.2 within 60 minutes of eating a huge meal. I've had multiple hospital presentations due to hypoglycemia.

I had a nuclear scan last month and bloods done which showed positive Thyroglobulin Ab and Thyroid Peroxidase Ab with little bit low TSH. But my endocrinologist decided to watch and wait, retest in 1 month as she wasn't sure it was definitely Graves based on my bloods.

Today I got a call advising that I need to start meds literally today. This week I had bloods done again and my TSH is now very low and my endocrinologist had an actual look at the nuclear scan that I did last month which she said 'as soon as I looked at it, I knew it was Graves' even though the imaging radiologist reported it normal.

So I'm to start Carbimazole 5mg and stay on it for a year now, and officially have the diagnosis of antibody-negative Graves Disease.

I feel so happy that I was right that something was wrong in my body, I have felt absolutely horrid. You know your body more than anyone! Don't listen to doctors who tell you otherwise, I know it's very hard. I've been down the ringer with different doctors over the years, so much dismissiveness and medical negligence it's nuts.

Background/full disclosure, in the 35-40 bracket, Full pinoy, but grew up abroad. Yes I‚Äôve dated Filipinas but they also grew up abroad. I usually spend time here once a yr but was never single, til now.

Luckily, met some new friends along the way and most warned me to never divulge that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúlocal‚Äù, And stick to mostly tagalog/taglish instead of full english when talking. They said it‚Äôll be harder to find dates but less headache. Not sure why though, maybe to not be associated as a passport bro?

Anyway, I dunno what it is, but so far, I find face to face approach almost way better than online. Which is opposite of my experience in Canada. The ones that  are from online tend to do checklist, shit testing and some sort of job interview inquiry line of questioning before we even agree on a coffee date.
Some are also very clearly not over their ex or whatever and just either trauma dumps or go full ‚Äúall men are trash vibes‚Äù. I‚Äôm pretty direct too, if convo flows well I ask for a coffee date but somehow, their list of requirements needs to be met first. I just don‚Äôt have that kind of time nor energy for that shit though.
Whereas offline, its a quick yes or no, and also very easy to set the next date when we vibed. No muss no fuss. Online is so exhausting. Or maybe I‚Äôm just doing it wrong. Any tips or should I just stick to face to face? But it feels like I‚Äôm denying options that way too.

I have to jump in here because I‚Äôm seeing so much negativity about Melanie after the first episode and I feel like it‚Äôs important to say something as someone who actually knows her in real life. 

Melanie is genuinely one of the kindest, most selfless people I‚Äôve ever met. Back in high school, she was our extremely beloved student body president and made sure everyone felt welcome and was always offering a helping hand and a big hug everywhere she went. 

A decade out of high school, we went out for coffee in the middle of a snowstorm when she suddenly pulled over. I thought we we were stalled or something, but really she had spotted an elderly woman shoveling her driveway. Melanie ran across the street, took the shovel, and said, ‚ÄúLet me do that for you.‚Äù That‚Äôs just who she is. 

Another small example: one of the cakes that was featured in this very first episode, I was actually with her when she bought the ingredients. While she was in the store gathering what she needed, she also picked up a meal for a homeless man sitting outside. When I mentioned it to her she didn‚Äôt even recall doing it because it‚Äôs just what she does. 

People keep commenting that she‚Äôs ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù or ‚Äúover the top,‚Äù but if you knew her, you‚Äôd know that‚Äôs simply her personality and always has been. She‚Äôs big, she‚Äôs bright, she‚Äôs full of life. And yes, she shared something deeply personal about her health. That wasn‚Äôt a ploy for sympathy, that‚Äôs her reality. (And this is reality TV!) The truth is, she has gone through so much more than most of us could even imagine, and she still shows up for others with love and joy. She‚Äôs inspired me to be a better friend, a better mom, and a better person. 

I understand that reality TV edits can amplify personalities, (and so does Melanie- she is surprised how several of her competitors are portrayed by the edits-) but please just remember there‚Äôs a real person behind the screen and in this case, it‚Äôs someone who has dedicated her life to caring for others as a (trauma, labor and delivery, and hospice) nurse, who lifts people up every chance she gets, and who is chasing a crazy, out-of-this-world dream by competing on this show. Instead of tearing her down, it surely would be more fun to root her on?? 

She‚Äôs not just a contestant on The Food Network. She is my friend, and a mom, and one of the loveliest people I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of knowing.

Before going to bed, urinate (zero times). Go to sleep, and then all of a sudden, you have a bathroom trip at two in the morning. It occurs again a couple of hours later (two). I feel like I didn't get much sleep by morning.

I once measured it out of desperation: about 600 milliliters per night. I can understand why my bladder wakes me up. I've already stopped drinking water in the evenings, stopped drinking coffee late, and even stopped eating snacks. My body still manages to find a way.

In fact, something I didn't anticipate‚Äîlogging my evenings‚Äîhelped. I kept a journal of my food, beverages, screen time, and stress levels. After a week, the patterns became apparent: salty meals combined with a phone before bed = surefire wake-ups.

I was able to sleep for longer periods of time by putting my phone away earlier and switching from heavy meals to lighter ones. Better than before, but not perfect.

1nknl8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1nknl8c/looking_for_a_cofounder_to_lead_user_growth_from/,Looking for a Co‚ÄëFounder to Lead User Growth from Day Zero,"# About Me & Where We Are Now

I‚Äôm a **technical founder**. I‚Äôve been quietly, obsessively building a C2C platform that I believe has the potential to become a unicorn. I‚Äôm almost done with the core product. The site is functional, the vision is clear, and the technology is solid.

Here‚Äôs what makes this exciting:

* **Nothing like it exists** \- at least not in the way I‚Äôm building it.
* It‚Äôs designed for a **global audience** from day one.
* The concept is **scalable** and **adaptable** to multiple markets.
* The potential upside is huge - but only if we can get it into people‚Äôs hands fast.

# Why I Need You

I‚Äôll be honest: I‚Äôm **not** the person to lead marketing and growth. I‚Äôm **shy**. I‚Äôm not naturally outgoing. I don‚Äôt have the business know‚Äëhow or the thick skin it takes to walk up to strangers, pitch them on the spot, and convince them to try something new.

But maybe you are. Maybe you‚Äôre the kind of person who:

* Feels **energized** talking to people - whether it‚Äôs in a coffee shop, at a networking event, or literally on the street.
* Doesn‚Äôt flinch at rejection - you see ‚Äúno‚Äù as just one step closer to ‚Äúyes.‚Äù
* Can **sell a vision** as easily as a product.
* Knows how to **create buzz** both online and offline.
* Understands that **early traction** is the lifeblood of a startup.

I can build the product. But without users, it‚Äôs just code on a server. That‚Äôs where you come in.

# What You‚Äôll Do

As the **Marketing & Growth Co‚ÄëFounder**, you‚Äôll own everything related to getting users in the door and keeping them engaged. That means:

* **Pre‚ÄëLaunch Hype** \- Building anticipation before we even go live.
* **Street‚ÄëLevel Outreach** \- Talking to people face‚Äëto‚Äëface, getting them to sign up on the spot.
* **Digital Growth Hacking** \- Finding creative, low‚Äëcost ways to reach thousands (and then millions) online.
* **Guerrilla Marketing** \- Crafting clever, unexpected campaigns that get attention without spending big.
* **Viral Social Media** \- Creating posts, challenges, or content that people can‚Äôt help but share.
* **Community Building** \- Turning early adopters into passionate advocates.
* **Brand Voice & Storytelling** \- Helping shape how the world sees us.

You‚Äôll have **full creative freedom** in your domain. I‚Äôm not here to micromanage you. I‚Äôm here to build alongside you.

# What This Is (and Isn‚Äôt)

* **This is not a salaried position.** You‚Äôll be joining as a **co‚Äëfounder**, which means your reward is **equity** and the chance to share in the upside if (when) we succeed.
* **This is not a side hustle** you can give an hour a week to. In the early days, we‚Äôll both be wearing multiple hats and putting in serious time.
* **This is not a safe bet.** Startups are risky. But the potential payoff - financially, professionally, personally - can be life‚Äëchanging.

# Who You Are

You might have a background in marketing, sales, PR, community management, or maybe you‚Äôve just always been the person who can get anyone excited about anything. You‚Äôre:

* **Fearless** in approaching strangers.
* **Resilient** in the face of rejection.
* **Creative** in finding ways to get attention.
* **Strategic** in thinking about growth.
* **Passionate** about building something from scratch.
* **Resourceful** enough to market with **zero or near‚Äëzero budget** \- because anyone can throw money at ads, but it takes real skill to make noise without spending big.
* Excited by the idea of **low‚Äëcost guerrilla marketing** and **viral social media** as your main weapons.

You‚Äôre not afraid to **get your hands dirty**. You understand that in the early days, ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù might mean everything from running social ads to literally handing out flyers.

# Why Join Now

Joining at this stage means:

* You‚Äôll have **real influence** over the direction of the company.
* You‚Äôll be part of the **founding story** \- the one we‚Äôll tell in interviews, on stage, and maybe even in a book someday.
* You‚Äôll get **founder‚Äëlevel equity** \- not an employee‚Äôs slice.
* You‚Äôll experience the **thrill (and chaos)** of launching something new.

If we succeed, you won‚Äôt just have a job - you‚Äôll have **built** something that exists in the world because of you.

# The Vision

I believe this platform can reach people in every corner of the globe. It‚Äôs designed to be **simple enough for anyone to use**, but **powerful enough to make a real difference**. I can see the headlines, the user stories, the communities forming around it. But vision alone doesn‚Äôt get users. Execution does. And execution takes a team.

# The Ask

I‚Äôm looking for **one person** \- not a committee, not an agency - to join me as a partner in this adventure. Someone who will:

* Treat this like **their own company** (because it will be).
* Bring **energy, ideas, and action** every single day.
* Be willing to **take risks** and **move fast**.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to be a co‚Äëfounder but didn‚Äôt have the tech skills - this is your chance. I‚Äôve got the tech covered. I need you to cover the growth.

# Final Word

This is the kind of opportunity that doesn‚Äôt come with guarantees, but it does come with possibilities. If you‚Äôre the right person, this could be the most exciting, challenging, and rewarding thing you‚Äôve ever done.

If your heart‚Äôs racing a little right now, if you‚Äôre already thinking of ways to get our first 1,000 users without spending a fortune, if you can picture yourself telling people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building this amazing new thing‚Äù, then we should talk.

**This is not a job. This is a journey.** If you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable salary, a neat job description, and a predictable 9‚Äëto‚Äë5, this isn‚Äôt for you. If you‚Äôre looking for a chance to build something from the ground up, to be part of a founding team, to take an idea from zero to global impact, then please DM me.",0,1758237570.0,malaysians,0,0.2,False

So, I just hit the big 5-0, and let me tell you, the idea of trading in my soul-sucking 40-hour work week for something a little... more thrilling? It‚Äôs been brewing in my mind like a strong cup of coffee on a Monday morning. Instead of staring at spreadsheets, I‚Äôm dreaming about 40-mile bike rides! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. ""What‚Äôs so great about pedaling for hours?"" Well, let me break it down for you:

**Why bike riding is my new jam:**

- **Freedom:** The wind in your hair, sunshine on your face‚Äîwho wouldn‚Äôt want that instead of fluorescent lights? 
- **Health benefits:** Seriously, it's like a two-for-one deal. Get fit while enjoying nature? Yes, please!
- **Community:** Meeting people who share this passion, trading tips, and maybe even planning that epic weekend ride together.

But here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîI‚Äôve got to plan this new ""second act"" like I planned my vacation to Hawaii (which means sorting out the details so my adventure doesn‚Äôt fade like my first attempt at a sourdough loaf).

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking:

1. **Get the Gear:** I'm talking about a decent bike, a comfy seat (let‚Äôs be real, no one wants the *after-biking-ouch*), and some snazzy gear to feel semi-pro.
2. **Start Small:** Maybe a 5-mile ride to begin with. No need to go all Lance Armstrong right out of the gate. 
3. **Join a Group:** Local biking clubs often have great communities. Why go solo when you can meet fellow enthusiasts?
4. **Plan Your Routes:** There are beautiful paths out there‚Äîfind some that will inspire you to keep pedaling, not just a straight road that feels like a treadmill.
5. **Mindset Shift:** This is not just about exercise. It‚Äôs about embracing a lifestyle that‚Äôs fun, freeing, and full of adventures yet to come! 

Imagine rolling past gorgeous landscapes, mapping out weekend getaways, splurging on post-ride ice cream without the guilt, and maybe even making new friends along the way. How cool would that be?

1nknegx,https://www.reddit.com/r/911dispatchers/comments/1nknegx/thinking_of_joining_the_forces_again/,Thinking of joining the forces again.,"I‚Äôm retired of 20 years and I have been thinking about getting back into dispatching. Pretty easy decision you say? Not so much.

PTSD: my previous center wore me out. I have been dx‚Äôd with PTSD. I‚Äôm on meds for it but when I start to do testing online, I get this knot in my gut.

The reason why I want to do it is for the money. I don‚Äôt know how much I would be able to do in a calm situation.

Text to 9-1-1: I am really worried about having to deal with this if I do get back in. Is it something that is easy to miss coming in or pictures of accident scenes and such. 

I‚Äôm 58, about to be 59. I think I am trying to justify this decision with money but I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this for that reason. I lost my compassion for people a long time ago and not sure if it‚Äôs something I can get back. 

What would you say to me if we were having coffee?

1nknddw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheDistantGod/comments/1nknddw/infected_by_happiness/,Infected by Happiness,"‚ÄúDo you want to be happy?‚Äù The man next to me asked without turning around. I said nothing at first, my mind was occupied with dark thoughts. The last nights had been shaped by memories and sleeplessness. It took me a while to realise through the fog that someone spoke to me.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt everyone?‚Äù I asked with irony, barely taking the stranger‚Äôs question seriously. How did he know about my bad mood anyway?¬†

‚ÄúNot everyone gets the chance,‚Äù the stranger continued in a natural tone. Yet he still faced away from me. A dark coat and hat concealed his stature. A feeling like ants crawling on my skin took hold of me, although it was very faint. Something about this stranger was odd. Unsettlingly odd. I was on my way to university like every morning, the full train making it impossible to move. And the people talking to each other or their phone erased any awareness for the person next to them. So I guess it was no surprise no one but me noticed the stranger. I said nothing to him. My guts told me to be careful. To my relief the stranger didn‚Äôt say anything more either. When my train finally reached the right station, I hurried outside. A hand on my shoulder made me stop. I turned around to see the stranger‚Äôs face. A shiver seized my body and paralysed my mind.

‚ÄúI could make you happy forever,‚Äù he continued our little talk. I couldn‚Äôt answer, his unnatural wide smile reminded me of some creepy Mickey Mouse horror story. The eyes were hidden beneath the hat‚Äôs brim. Not that I was eager to discover more. Acting on instinct I only answered that I was fine. At least I thought it was me answering, my voice sounded strange to my own ears. Forgotten was my heavy mood from the previous night, turned into what one might have called fright. Not waiting for a response, I turned away to be on my way. I looked over my shoulder a few times while walking, but no stranger in a coat followed. His creepy smile, though, had burned itself into my mind.¬†

The day went on as usual and the routine of lectures and practicals let me calm down. Forgotten was my earlier dread until I entered the train bound for home. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man in a dark coat. Instantly my mind went back to the morning‚Äôs encounter, but it was just an ordinary man. There was no big smile on his face. Perhaps I had only imagined the strange occurrence in the morning. Coming home, reading a book and listening to music did the trick like always. Before I knew it, I was falling asleep and waking up after yet another crappy night in the early morning. When I walked to the train station a woman crossed my way. Still half-asleep with my head in the clouds I barely avoided bumping into her.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I muttered looking at her to see the reaction.

‚ÄúNo worries, my dear.‚Äù She frolicked with a smile. My heart dropped a beat at the repeated scenery of a plastic smile. She must have seen my shock because when I turned to hurry on, a ghastly laughter followed me. Echoing through the grey morning like ripples in a pond. Or was it just imagination? A product of my tired mind? Please God let it be a dream, I thought while walking. But it wasn‚Äôt a dream, deep inside I knew it.¬†Ignoring the people around on my way to the faculty I just hurried on. I didn‚Äôt want to ponder what might be true and what might be the results of my sleepless nights. The lab would be safe. The lab was always safe. In there I knew what was happening. In there I didn‚Äôt have to think about people. Or the world in general. The sediment core for my assessment for one of my subjects was waiting. The long tube, filled with horizontal layers of soil was cut in half and lying ready for me on the long counter. It was very early, so there weren‚Äôt many other people there. Most started at nine o‚Äôclock, I liked to be almost done by then. When they came with coffee I would be only one more hour before packing my stuff and finding a suitable place for the following report. The different layers had to be categorised on a sheet of paper, colour, size of grains, form of grains it all had to be noted down together with the measurements concerning where in the core these different layers were located. I even dug up a large pebble here and there. A few, not very interesting fossils I found farther down close to the lowest layers of the core. Whilst at the top, I could name several traces left by burrowing animals and roots. I was almost through when the first other students arrived. One of them was what caused me to quicken the pace. He wore an unnaturally happy smile. He said nothing, not unusual for the people around me. Most seemed intimidated by my presence. But they also paid me no mind. That guy, though, kept staring at me again and again. Only to go back to his own task once I noticed. No one else seemed to realise. No one else was being stared at. I could have asked him what he wanted. But my inbuilt alarm system kept me from it. It was a dream. It had to¬† be a damn dream. Denial got the better of me when I took my stuff and finished earlier than my perfectionism approved of. But I couldn‚Äôt concentrate with the creep around. I would just start on the report and come back later. Feeling the old familiar restlessness though, I didn‚Äôt stay in the faculty. I aimed straight for the door leading outside. My feet carried me homewards as if they had a will of their own.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was on that way home when I had to face reality, more or less. I could feel the peoples‚Äô stares outside. They were everywhere. I managed to admit to myself that someone must be playing some trick on me. After all, I had my experience with being the outcast, and although it hadn‚Äôt been my role for years now, I figured that perhaps someone just wanted to have some fun with that loner who never came to any parties. Whenever I turned to see, none was there. But I could feel eyes on me. The whole time. It was when I rounded the corner to cross the street where the tram used to drive that I saw. Several of the dozens of passengers inside the vehicle looked outside. Staring at me as soon as their eyes found what they were looking for. They were grinning, again. Their eyes followed me until I was too far away for them to see. A shiver ran down my spine. It was starting to get a habit. I shook my head. The tram was going at high speed, certainly I had just imagined things. The man in the coat was still in my head, ever since that encounter. The woman, the student, the people on the street, it was just my mind playing tricks. It had to be. Without any evidence supporting my shrewd observings, I brushed it off, once again. Only at home I noticed that my mind had all kinds of excuses to not focus on my work. It was infuriating me, the absurd idea of grinning people chasing me. And yet it upset me, more than I liked. Unable to clear my thoughts, I got drunk that afternoon. There is nothing better for a student than to clear one‚Äôs head from all the lectures by indulging in some good stuff to wipe the hard disk. It did not always work in my case, but it helped fairly well.

Another horror came two days later. I decided to go back to the university like usual, determined to prove to myself that this was nothing but nonsense. I started with lectures in the morning, ignoring the feeling of being watched and stayed until late in the evening to work on my assessment. There were only three or four students about at this time, all of us sitting for ourselves, working with our respective tasks. A fellow student asked me for a sheet of paper. I recognised the same plastic smile at once. I registered what was happening, ran through all other explanations only to find nothing in my brain‚Äôs database and sighed. Tired of running, I did the only reasonable thing.¬†

‚ÄúYou seem to be happy. Having a good day?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last days have all been good,‚Äù he answered, still displaying that smile of his which bordered toward insanity. A chill ran down my spine as he spoke. It wasn‚Äôt monotone, it wasn‚Äôt happy. But something in between giving off a hint of inhumanity.¬†‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you like to be happy too?‚Äù He continued asking while his eyes grew wider. ‚ÄúYou seem so terribly troubled by pain.‚Äù He was the same, he was the same as the stranger in the train. Something seemed to leer at me from inside my fellow student‚Äôs body. Something which examined me from that blank stare. His happy mask couldn‚Äôt fool me. ‚ÄúOnce happy you will forget sadness.‚Äù The creature continued, I felt its words lulling me to sleep. Making my mind heavy and plump. Every hair on my body stood on end, a result of the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

‚ÄúNeed to go,‚Äù I said, getting up in one motion. I barely avoided the student‚Äôs hand which reached for me. Suddenly he fixed me with a hungry stare. Alright, that was a new observation. Up until now everyone had just stared at me, passively. This, this was assimilation for the lack of a better term. Whatever he was, whatever it was. I was now its prey. Not wasting time, I made for the door. The student followed, bumping into some unfortunate girl. I say unfortunate for what happened next was fascinating as well as terrifying. Upon coming in contact with the smiling maniac, she staggered. Then she remained still for a moment before she too started to smile. Wider and wider it grew until she fixed me with the same stare.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt have time to wonder, I had to run.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you see how happy we are?‚Äù They said in unison, snickering with glee. Managing to slip through the closing door of an elevator, I could outrun them. The last thing I saw was their smile as they stared through the shrinking space between the doors. Yet the chase didn‚Äôt end. They were outside as well. I did not stop to put it to the test if those infected people would chase me too. I just kept running down the hill, to the train station. The train itself was almost empty, only a few sleepy passengers sat on their respective seats. None of them seemed to care for an out of breath student. I was grateful for not living directly in the city. My home lies on the other side of the mountain. It isn‚Äôt countryside but neither is it the bustling city. I went home without detours and locked the door. Something I usually didn‚Äôt bother with.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I did not go out, not back to university nor anywhere else for a few days. I was too shaken. I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with that kind of madness. Thing is, sitting at home caused me to feel trapped after a while. I needed to go out, get moving. The darkened streets of that small town were always devoid of people at night. Two or three am was the dead spot when absolutely everyone slept. Silently I slipped outside, onto the main street and into the neighbourhood next to me full of nice gardens and soft breezes. After days I finally breathed without being afraid of being seen. The cool night air was tranquil. Far ahead I saw a cat, it stopped to look at me. I looked back. It started smiling. The cat, smiled. I swallowed and stopped walking. Turning away again, the animal quickly walked across the street vanishing in a garden full of thick trees. I should have turned back at that point, but being almost fearlessly curious had always been one of my problems. So I kept walking until the way through the neighbourhood joined the large main street again. It was there when I heard someone running. I heard even more running behind him. I quickly ducked around the corner of a hedge.

‚ÄúGet away from me you weirdos,‚Äù I heard a man call out. He stumbled or was somehow stopped right before rounding the corner where I stood. All I knew is that he fell silent, the other people didn‚Äôt talk to begin with. What I could feel was the shift in the air around. Something dark and threatening seemed to appear, or perhaps grow in the man as he was assimilated. I could hear his breathing growing calmer. Whilst my heart was starting to beat faster due to the danger around. Have you ever stood right next to mortal danger incarnate while only a thin wall of plants separated you from it? It‚Äôs like standing behind a tree trunk and on the other side would be a very pissed bear. Only that you would know what the bear was about to do. I couldn‚Äôt tell what this virus would do to me. Hook me up to the hivemind of happiness. I wasn‚Äôt interested in being part of the colony, hadn‚Äôt been at the best of times. Call me antique, but I did not like the idea of swapping out my soul for something blissfully fabricated. I would not even consider it. I kept standing frozen in place until I heard footsteps growing fainter. I took a few steps backwards before peering around the corner. The man still stood there, alone. He had his back turned to me. I should have vanished, run home. I did not. Instead I did something indescribably stupid.

‚ÄúDo you need help?‚Äù I asked, keeping my distance.¬†

‚ÄúThanks for asking, my dear. But I am absolutely fantastic!‚Äù He said while spinning around to face me. His expression was marked by the same, leeringly, empty smile.¬†

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù I managed to mutter, keeping my relatively easy going composure while turning around to make for home once and for all. It wasn‚Äôt before I was already in front of my apartment when I turned to look up at the main street. The man had followed me, silent as an owl. He stared at me, smiling. He hadn‚Äôt hunted me. He had followed me home! Finding out where I lived. His smile grew even wider when the predatory glint crept into those wide eyes. At once I made for my door as he sprinted towards me. I shut it and turned the key.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

After getting home that night I stopped going out entirely. Not even a short stroll could tempt me. Too great was the fear of getting infected by happiness. I had followed the news for a while now, just to see if I was mad. I wasn‚Äôt. First, they had called it a pandemic. Something that spread upon contact and at an exponential rate. It took only a few weeks for society to be completely corrupted by it. As soon as even the people on TV started smiling like crazy, I switched off the TV for the foreseeable future. Nothing changed for that matter though. Life continued, trains drove, people worked. Yet all of them wore that unsettling smile. Sorrow, they said, was a thing of the past. Something people would only know from stories from now on. Given that people still read stories. For with that happiness came also a kind of monotone mindset. Nothing mattered. Like robots they carried on, not dreaming, not feeling. Not thinking. As long as they smiled everything was fine. The world could go down and die, it would mean nothing to them. With concern I saw my resources of dry goods dwindle. My mind wandered back to the last unpleasant incident at university. This thing would recognise me. Perhaps it was even searching for me. As if to confirm my fears a loud knock came from my front door. I froze in place immediately. My mind reeled with the memories as well as the faint touch of madness from the missing contact with other human beings. Ghastly laughter filled my ears, accompanied by sneering whispers barely perceivable. Another heavy knock sounded, increasing the insane noises. Like being guided by invisible strings my legs moved towards my home‚Äôs entrance. My mind playing several possible futures, my sense trying its best to not pay heed to the falsehood produced by my fear induced self. When my hand reached for the doorknob, I didn‚Äôt feel the cold metal. My body was numbed by the unreal happenings. The shock of seeing the same stranger with whom my nightmare had begun was just another fact in a world gone mad. Days earlier it might have had an impact. But all the wide grin invoked now was, relief. I would face my fear. And I would go down or prevail.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúAre you having a good day?‚Äù The stranger asked in the same monotone voice I had memorised.

‚ÄúI am always having a good day.‚Äù I replied stubbornly not prepared to play its game. For a moment the entity studied me, never altering its facial expression. Unable to ignore the stomach-churning grin, I looked at his buttoned coat instead. The hat still hid the eyes, which I assumed harboured the same hungry gaze I had encountered from the students.

‚ÄúYou are lying. Don‚Äôt you want to be happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I want to be happy, who doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù I said jokingly. When the stranger reached out to touch me, I took a step back. Like a predator he followed until both of us stood in my kitchen. There he stopped, cocking his head.

‚ÄúWhat you give is not happiness,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs numbness, a mask, nothing more than a fa√ßade.‚Äù For the first time, the disgusting smile wavered. I felt the air around us freshen up like a storm.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He exclaimed, his tone a mixture of anger and confusion. The reaction gave me new courage.

‚ÄúPeople may be miserable or sad or angry. But without that there would be no happiness.‚Äù Blazing eyes made of fire locked with my own. Taking a step forward I carried on nonetheless. ‚ÄúSo to come back to your question. No. I do not want to be happy. I do not want to be sad, but I want to be me!‚Äù With that the winds fell silent and the fire in the stranger‚Äôs eyes died down to a gentle glow. Like a broken curse, the expression returned to what it might have been before that awful smile. Warm and content. ",1,1758236984.0,u_TheDistantGod,0,1.0,False

I honestly wonder how people manage to survive in Morocco with the minimum wage being around 3000 dirhams.

Basic products are insanely expensive compared to people‚Äôs income. Just to give a few examples:

	‚Ä¢	1 liter of milk can easily represent 10% of a minimum daily wage, sometimes even more.
	‚Ä¢	Tomatoes, fruit, fish‚Ä¶ the prices are through the roof.
	‚Ä¢	And meat has become a complete luxury for most families.


Even something as simple as a 10 dirham coffee equals about 10% of a minimum daily wage. And I‚Äôm not talking about fancy caf√©s or Starbucks, but just your average neighborhood caf√©.

And let‚Äôs not even mention rent or public transportation, which also hit people hard and make daily life even more difficult.

This situation is unsustainable. How can a country justify that the most basic essentials , milk, vegetables, protein, are priced so disproportionately compared to what people actually earn?

First I want to start by thanking everyone for the advice and support, I really appreciate it!

Before I get to what happened earlier today I want to address a few things:

1. My husband is the first to stand up for me, while I hate confrontations he doesn't shy away and he won't let anyone disrespect me and stay quiet, he fought with his family a lot because of this. As I explained before I was the one who wouldn't let him cut off his family and kept insisting on going to ""family lunch"" every Saturday. Which led to a few fights between us. For those who grew up in Asian or Black households know families tend to be toxic and we don't cut them off, we are thought to endure it. 

2. I can't answer to what my BIL thought of his soon to be ex wife behaviour, honestly is one of the things I want to talk to him directly without involving anyone else except my husband of course. If he eventually explains I'll be sure to let you all know. 

3. Regarding my parents in law, they aren't bad people. Did they allow certain comments to pass before shutting it down yes, but honestly I just think they didn't want to be in the middle and be given ultimatums to choose one side, at the end of the day if they did they would lose one of their sons. 

  
Now on to what happened, earlier. My husband is on a business trip out of State scheduled from today until next Monday. He didn't want to go in case something happened. I told him to go and if anything happened I could call baby BIL and baby SIL or his parents or any of my close friends. 

Husband went to the airport really early so he couldn't drive me to work, so I took my car. Fast forward to lunch time me and few co-workers went to grab coffee, and who is seating in the coffee right across the street from my office? Devil Spawn! I told my co-workers I didn't want to be there and for them to grab me something and turned around bolting to the door, she follows me outside and asks me to hear her out, I just told her I've been hearing her out since I joined the family. She said she just wants to apologise and wants her family back. I told her I don't want anything from her except to leave me the fuck alone. Went back to my office called my father in law and asked him if he could pick me up after work and the man was in front of my office right on the dot, as for my car will probably stay in the parking lot until my husband comes back or I'll ask baby BIL to help me get it.",552,1758236753.0,AITAH,45,0.97,False

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ieaaG0K)

* I'm British so get used to sarcasm sprinkled with lots of dark humour.
* Big Heavy Metal fan. Recent attendee of Bloodstock 2025. Deathcore is where it is at for me but I do have a big playlist of guilty pleasures from all kinds of genres. Can't beat some 80s pop now and then.
* Gym rat in the making. I thought it was about time I started taking care of myself a little better. I'm actually taking this somewhat seriously.
* Very much interested in physics/astronomy/cosmology. It hurts my brain at times but it's fun learning how things work on a deeper level. I'm always up for chatting about any new developments or theories.
* I play video games but not as much as I used to. I'm mostly playing OldSchool RuneScape, Satisfactory and Modded Minecraft at the moment.
* I enjoy having deep thought provoking conversations that tickle the brain, no matter how silly the subject.
* Anime is a favourite of mine although I haven't watched anything new for a while. The last things I watched were AOT, Dragonball Super and One Punch Man. I've been meaning to start One Piece.
* I do like to play a good board game. My recent favourites have been Terraforming Mars, Scythe and Wingspan. I've been on the lookout for a D&D group for years.
* Some other things I like to do are hiking, cycling, swimming and exploring.
* I'm hoping to try rock climbing or bouldering soon. I've also got driving lessons to start.

What I'm looking for in you:

* Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
* Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
* Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
* Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

For example, the (now discarded) iPhone silent toggle switch. How exactly is that ""handle"" mounted?

The next day I did it again. Same dose and then same feeling again because I thought it was the coffee. Fasting too this time‚Ä¶

Now I‚Äôve had anxiety ever since and I Know it was from the ashwaghanda. They put me on lexapro and now I‚Äôm on Prozac. I increase my dosage but eventually the anxiety seems to catch up with my dosage and I have to increase again and again.

1nkn2nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nkn2nv/aitah_for_locking_the_backdoor_of_our_house/,AITAH for locking the backdoor of our house,"This is so stupid but here it goes. I (21 female) live at home while going to college and working part time so I can pay my own bills and save a little bit. My schedule has school on Mondays and Wednesdays in person until two o'clock and I work most of the other weekdays until two o'clock. When I'm home I am usually in the house somewhere alone (of course with my cats and small dog). I have ADHD so I tend to wear noise cancelling headphones, Adderall barely fixes noise sensitivities for me. Because I cannot hear much through my headphones I tend to lock the doors to the house; that's something that I have also done on instinct since I was a child. My mom always has the same routine of locking all the doors and so do I. When I am home there are also landscapers that come to the house, but they have never come on the same day, and because they work right up to the front and back doors, and I am a female home alone: I like the doors locked. This is all normal to me and I've done it for years now.¬†

In the past two months my siblings (15f and 14m) have been attending high school together for my brother's freshman and sister's sophomore year. They leave the house together and get home together from the bus at 3pm on the dot every day. We also live in Texas where it is very hot, so I understand when they want to get into the house quickly after being on the metal bus for around 30 min. So, in the first couple of weeks, I had forgot about the locked door, and they threw stuff at my window to let me in. I would feel bad and apologize then we would talk about their days. ¬†

I decided to buy keys for my brother so he can be let in and I gave my sister the pink one off my keychain, because I had an extra and she likes pink. When I gave them the keys in the kitchen our mom was making a drink or something and said she had bought multiple keys to give everyone in the house a long while back, including an emergency hidden under a rock THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. I had forgotten about the key until my mom brought it up. both of my siblings said they knew about the key but said they didn't like using it and I am home every day anyways. I was mad and told them to start using the key instead of yelling at me every day when I'm busy doing homework or napping. ¬†

I still gave them both the new keys. I thought this problem would be solved. But in the past two months my sister and brother have banged on the back door coming home from school because it was locked, or yelling at my UPSTAIRS window to let them in. Of course I would run down to let them in whenever I saw them, but when I ask every time ""why don't y'all use the keys I got you?"" They say every time that it's my fault for locking the back door and/or that they don't want to use the keys. ¬†

This week I have left the door unlocked almost every day except for yesterday when I fell asleep on the couch after school, but I still popped up immediately to let them in. they have the same answer as always and its starting to make me not to want to support my siblings anymore. ¬†

For reference my siblings have gotten in as lot of trouble in this last year that I will not disclose, but it was normal shit teenagers do to act out. Our parents are divorced but we live with our mother, she works 50+ hour weeks and is diagnosed OCD and Anxiety; our father lives 2 hours away but works from home, so he is the usual one to check up on school stuff for all of us, he is also diagnosed anxiety and depression. This makes for a great combo when the kids do something wrong. I have spent a lot of time standing up for my siblings over the years and I love them so fucking much, so I consistently talk them up and stand up for them when my parents tell me how they are disappointed or upset with my little siblings; including, getting yelled at for their actions and trying to calm my parents down before it gets to my siblings. It doesn't always work but I try when I can, and when it all falls on me as the only person ""watching them"" (remember they are teenagers) I make sure I am always available for them. I've done this for them since my parents divorced 12 years ago; I was only 9 at the time, so sometimes¬†I joke saying that I am the mini mom; not to my mom, or siblings obviously that would make them upset. ¬†

Having that weight on you for years is hard and has strained my relationship with my mother, father, and siblings. They somehow all want me to back down but still be the one to tell them what to do, where to go, and make sure they are okay. I am also the person that wakes up at 5am to make sure my sister is up for school, which I did this morning and even bought her a morning coffee to wake up.  (BTW our mom used to yell AT ME for waking them up in the morning, because I was too loud. They are both deep sleepers with locked rooms, so I have to yell through them to wake them up sometimes, so i stopped then for a while too, but that ended up with both of my siblings almost being truant last year. I'm not letting that happen again this year).¬†

I am mostly used to this, and I will always do it because i love them. i have worked hard to repair my relationship with my parents; the three of us agree to try and not stress me out to much about the kids but know that i am a resource for them. With my siblings I'm the person my sister comes to for advice. I remember when that happened the first time and i called my BFF to tell her that I had a real conversation with her without a fight or argument. My brother is not there¬†with me yet, but I can imagine it's harder for a boy to ask advice from his big sister. All the relationships become strained when I think something we should do for the kids differs from my mom's¬†or when I ‚Äúnag‚Äù the kids to do their chores (in my mom's words). I have grown to have a short temper with everyone, but I have been working on that for the past few months, and with the new medication, I am doing much better controlling my anxious/controlling behavior.¬†

sorry for the small rant but now you have some more context on why I am at my breaking point.¬†

Today, while I was sitting outside with our dog my siblings came home from school, in a good mood. I said hello and they walked right past me. Then a few minutes passed and it was pretty hot, so I went inside, to find the back door locked. Obviously, I turned over the rock, got the key, and opened the door. It took less than 30 seconds. I did not say anything at the time because they both went upstairs before I came in, so I didn't bother and went back to what I was doing inside. An hour later I went downstairs to see if my sister wanted to go to the bookstore with me. She mumbled no and seemed tired, and she said just that, so I didn't push her. We started chatting and a few minutes later our brother came downstairs. Eventually I asked why they locked me outside. My brother said our sister did it. When I asked her why, she said ""so you know how it feels to be locked out too.""¬†

I was livid, I told her that for the past week I left it unlocked every day for them. She scoffed at me and said it doesn't matter because yesterday it was locked. I was next to the door asleep and got up to unlock it within seconds. I told her this and we went back and forth. We both started yelling at each other, I can't remember who yelled first but it was probably me, because I was fed up with her. I asked her ""Why not use your keys!"" and she said they don't want to use the keys, and I should never be locking it anyways because I know when they come home from school. I told her it's stupid to think that I will drop whatever I'm doing just to open a door they have keys for. MULTIPLE KEYS!!!!!! They both say i should never be locking the door, that it's stupid to think that I have too just because I am home alone. My brother dipped out of the screaming match at some point. I yelled at my sister to grow the fuck up and learn how to turn a damn key. And no, she has not lost it and even if she did there is an ""emergency"" key by the door. I yelled my way upstairs and called my brother an ass for treating me that way.¬†

This all has me feeling as if I should stop sticking up for my siblings, they obviously would not do the same for me. They can‚Äôt even respect my small wish to have a locked door. I have tried everything in this situation and i am done. I do not want to tell my parents how they are doing well in school when they probably are not¬†and i do not want to have to wake them up every day and try to tiptoe around our sleeping mom so i don't piss her off.¬†

I feel horrible, and I will apologize for yelling at them both once I calm down. I know I acted like an asshole today, that I know for sure. Should I just be leaving the door unlocked and change my habit of locking it when I'm alone, or should my siblings be using their keys instead of yelling at me every day. Am I the asshole for locking the doors¬†
