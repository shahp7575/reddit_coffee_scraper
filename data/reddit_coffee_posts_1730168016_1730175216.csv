Hello, my name is Michael and I am from NY.

I am an EFNP, and my friends would describe me as very outgoing, mellow, and positive

I would not say I am the typical Redditor.

My degree is in PR/ Communications, I think that the way we interact with people is very important. I love to get different perspectives. If you live in another country I would be curious about it.

Music is a big part of my life. I love retro music mostly 60s and 70s. I have been playing guitar since I was 14. I’ve been to so many concerts. I collect vinyl.

I love to get outdoors and take walks and go hiking. The fall and the leaves are great this time of year around here. A homemade iced coffee is one of the things I look forward to.

I hope to hear from you.",1,1730175009.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1gem4qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1gem4qz/women_are_pretty_scary/,Women are pretty (scary),"Earlier at a coffee shop, where the barista was a very pretty barista with a dyed red hair. As I snuck glances at her, my mom suddenly asked me to finish the transaction, which was tipping and signing. If you're wondering why, it's because she gets intimidated, as well as never knows what to tip at a place that isn't a restaurant with a set total.

  
I approached the counter, feeling and seeing her STARING the crap at me. I think it was because she also found me pretty and captivating. JK. It was as if she was trying to intimidate me, reminding me of a TikTok I'd seen where employees stare to scare customers into giving a tip. Especially since right when I finished, she smiled and said, ""Thank you!"". 

Fast forward, my sisters drink is done and asks if she wants the leftover of the coffee from the blender. So not only was she a pretty (scary) woman, she's also nice. Even if it was just leftovers, a lot of baristas don't give the leftovers of the smoothie/coffee.

Who knew going to a coffee shop could make me captivated and so intimidated at once :D.",1,1730175002.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False
1gem449,https://www.reddit.com/r/pastry/comments/1gem449/am_i_crazy_for_wanting_to_open_a_croissantcruffin/,Am I crazy for wanting to open a croissant/cruffin focused bakery?,"I live in a city with a metro of around 100k, where, unfortunately, there’s no really good bakery. A lot of folks here make decent money, and the cost of living is low, but the number one complaint is about needing to drive to nearby cities just to find good food. I think a high-end croissant shop could do really well here.

Here's where I'm at: I’m a home cook/baker who (probably) has more money than sense and I'm in the dangerous position to be able to afford to start a bakery (on a budget). I’ve got big ideas for the concept, recipes, and marketing, and I’m prepared to cover the initial costs. But there’s a catch—I only have about 5-6 hours a day to dedicate to this. Ideally, I'd find a partner to take a significant share of the profit and handle the early morning baking, and maybe even the actual process of making the laminating the dough, etc, and making the fillings. I think ideally that I would be the person who handles the business, marketing, menu, etc, while also working in the kitchen during afternoons to come up with the flavors of the week, making fillings, etc. I don't need need to maximize personal profit, so I could actually afford to pay an employee a very good wage -- I'm more in this for the long-term growth, so I would be happy to pay them very well (though I wouldn't want to give up much, if any, equity). 

Of course, I'd need an espresso machine to offer coffee too. But is the only way to go about this to go big? I’d prefer to keep it small—have a streamlined menu with just a few items each week: 2 filled croissants, 2 filled cruffins, a plain croissant, pain au chocolat, and maybe a Danish now and then. Maybe a savory pastry. I’m not looking to run a full-scale bakery with bread or dozens of items.

Another idea I had was to make all the items in one location and maybe open a few small coffee stands around the city, so more people could get the pastries without the need for a large, single-location bakery. I don't really want to deal with running around and cleaning tables, but that may be an expectation in this area, I don't know. 

Would love your thoughts. Is it feasible to keep it small and focused? Or is there a way to balance quality and profitability without going all in on a big space with lots of seating? Any advice on what could work (or what to avoid) would be great! Am I delulu?",1,1730174939.0,pastry,0,1.0,False
1gem3pp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gem3pp,A very sincere Fall Exchange Thank you to u/22Knocks! It,"I was so happy when I was matched with a somewhat familiar name for my first Fall Exchange! We’ve since gone back and forth and it was super cool to see how many things we had in common despite being on opposite sides of the US. From a love of horror and all things Halloween, to video games, and even a number of shows that we both enjoy (or have enjoyed at some point), it was super incredible to get to know u/22Knocks a bit more on a personal level, rather than just recognizing the username :)

I received:
Damask Haus - Thrice as Nice, Storge,  and CocoTantric
LVNEA - Pêche Obscène, and Papillon de Nuit
Pineward - Cotswold, and Velvetine
For the Scent of It - Nearly Nu, and Tobacco Pod

Plus a few 2ndhand freebie samples, like BHT’s Idyllwild, Kyse’s Vanille Debauche, and a decant of Salem Book & Coffee Shoppe from Amorphous. On top of that, they so generously included a pair of earrings from Myth & Fae, as well as a number of cat-themed stickers and art prints (as I’m maybe a bit notorious for my kitty obsession, haha), a few chocolates/ treats, fig jam, and a Halloween-themed face mask! The packaging was also exceptional and very on-theme, not to mention the cute little felt cut-outs being a Halloween garland!

Again, an incredibly heartfelt thank you for making my first Fall Exchange incredibly lovely! I’m so touched by your generosity and truly grateful to have been matched with you. Thank you, u/22Knocks !

""...Decaf caramel latte, *please!*"" 

He was annoyed. He looked at her and saw how the younger generations were failing their predecessors in every way. Disinterested, distracted, too cool to care. He didn't see the loop, playing behind her eyes. Even if he did, he wouldn't know what to make of it.

For a brief, blessed moment the loop receded as she punched in the order. It moved from her pupils to the back of her mind, but it would never go away. The concrete room would never go away. The pile of limbs, stacked neatly in the corner like firewood, would never go away. The PiGmAn would never go away.

""Anything else for you today?"" She asked, remembering suddenly what blood up to your ankles feels like.

""No,"" he huffed, ""just the coffee."" He quickly pulled out his card and pressed it against the reader.

""Ok, it's $3.85, just tap the - yeah. Whatever..."" She trailed off, and the loop returned.

The card reader dinged and the man swiped the receipt out of her hands, then shuffled out of the way. She wanted to say something, but it didn't matter. How do you explain something like this to someone like him? It took a year to make the court-appointed therapist understand, and when they did, they quit. If a shrink couldn't handle the loop, what chance did this *Brooks Brothers messenger bag asshole* have?

He wouldn't endure the loop, and he wouldn't have survived the concrete room. He wouldn't have had the guts to crawl into that culvert and wade through the viscera. He wouldn't have thought to snap an ulna in half and stab the PiGmAn. He wouldn't have been the last. 

A fresh voice cut through the loop.

""You ok?"" Her manager asked.

""No, not even a little,"" she replied.

1gem3iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1gem3iq/fruit_fly/,fruit fly,"maybe i’m trying to rewrite our story an unfathomable amount of times, until i find the formula where we didn't have to hurt eachother like that. to believe that in this universe we had to be the worst version of us just to help the other us in different times, so we could be together in a place where we didn't hurt again. perhaps i was the fool to think about the potential of change, when it was a flaw of design from the start. it was how the universe could teach me to not love so unconditionally and how to mend a tattered heart. 

my therapist made me talk about being depressed and i told her it was a pit, but not the type i find when i’m cutting up a mango for you. instead a dark hole that swallows all the good moments and spits out the shell of the person i used to be, while the pit grows and shrinks. as the day passes sometimes i forget it’s there, then i accidentally drown in the blackness and fear. i try not to remember that while my heart breaks, but the next day i try again and again and again and…

in another life i drink coffee and can stomach the idea of losing a fever dream. i don’t run at the first sign of trouble, i don’t make up trouble in my own head. meditation works and so does medication and i never kill my plants. i allow myself to have friendships and don’t question my worth. i draw the planets in the steam after hot showers and my hands know what it means to be loved. i don’t ask you anything about doing the dishes, you just smile at me cutting up a mango with those beautiful eyes looking up.

I read a lot about freezing beans so that decaf (sugar cane, light roast) stays fresh for a long time. Single dose beans are bagged individually although I’m guessing it wouldn’t last that long at this rate. It took quite some time to bag single doses, but making espresso with already dosed beans was a lot more convenient than I had thought. I may buy centrifugal tubes for regular beans and freeze them as well. 

Suppose this is somewhat thank you post as I learned a lot reading on this forum. I also made a note that frozen beans need to be ground a little finer. Sharing knowledge is cool.

Adam woke up the next day, and it was still raining. He got himself ready, went to the kitchen, and grabbed a coffee before going to the admin. It was still early, so the kids had not arrived yet. He asked the computer to transfer all the reports to his pad and then went to the lift. He took it to the observation deck and sat down as he watched the rain, enjoying the coffee. He slowly went over the reports. 

It had become his morning routine, and this was how he had discovered all the hidden projects his employees had. The rain stopped around seven, and he looked at the wet ground. If he had been a kid, he would have loved to jump in the puddles. He thought momentarily, then headed down to his storage and opened his seed bank. He found what he was looking for, grabbed a shovel, and walked out. After he got into the suit, he walked out, found a nice spot about five hundred meters from the base, and started digging. WD-40 came over and looked at him. 

“May I help you, Sir?” It asked. He looked up and chuckled at the number on its chest.  

“Naw.. wait, yes. A small fence around this plant and make sure it gets some fertilizer. Hopefully, it will grow up to be a nice tree.” He finished up and looked around. “I think we are doing a nice job. Hmm, maybe we should start a plant-spreading program.”

“Starting the program, searching the database for the best method.” It replied, and Adam chuckled. “I’m changing your designation to Druid. I will tell Jork and Vorts to help you with your mission. Oh, and not only appletrees like this, be diverse within logical parameters.”

“Affirmative. We're building a small fence before starting a new program.” As he spoke, his designation vanished and became the words druid.   Adam nodded to the droid, grabbed the shovel, and returned inside.  When he returned to the administration, he found the two working kids were leaving as they had finished their duties. Vorts had seen him outside and asked what he had done, so he explained that he had planted an Oaktree, and a droid had asked to help. He told them to add Druid’s new mission into the system and give it the resources, just as an experiment. Vorts started working on seed cloning as Jork launched a science droid to report Druid's work; he named the droid pet and gave one of the engineers the job of creating a storage unit they could use. After that, they promptly forgot to give instructions on how to plant trees for two droids with a ten thousand-year lifespan. 

Instead, they focused on the coming day, the student's presentation, and Adam ‘s daily swim with Miker.  They had a short meeting about the different projects and a few new ones that were being suggested. Adam had to hold back on a few as some got a little too excited about the oxygen in the air. It was still only 0.5% a long distance from the 21 to 22% they were aiming for. It was a good beginning, and the algae was starting to produce oxygen, as suspected. Vorts was working hard on the cloning process and requested ten more machines. Adam was going to look into it. He was, after all, going back to the Hub soon to pick up goods and deliver the professors. 

Vorts suggested they should ally with the university, allowing them access at a price. Adam told him he had already thought about it, and that was one of the reasons for Min-na’s presence. Any deals could quickly be hammered out. After that, he contacted Min-Na and told her he would like a meeting with her after the presentation.  She agreed as she was now tailing the professors and her granddaughter and enjoying the sights.

Adam then went to pick up Miker to go swimming. It was a happy reunion, and he was happy showing off his new swimming skills. Then they went to check the fish that had hatched in the other pool. The little boy showed him all the new things until they ended up in the kitchen, where they made Pizza for lunch. After lunch, He had to say goodbye to the boy, change, and meet with the professors and students. Besides them, a few others wanted to get an update and understand what was going on. The new crew was curious, and a few of them were highly educated.

The students did a great job with the information they had, showing the state of Dirt when bought, the scans done by the survey and Adam, and how they matched up. Then, they went into the difference in mindset and how Adam, with a relatively low budget, had managed to change the planet. If the same survey team had arrived now, they would have definitely marked the planet as potential for colonization.  

They followed up by going over the major projects and their impacts, discussing ideas considered stupid, such as activating the volcanos and taking nitrogen from Onic. They still smiled at the name, how it had actually worked, and how they had adjusted when finding out seeding the sea and making fertilizer was a better method as it started the photosynthesizing process, creating oxygen and distributing nitrogen into the soil. Not only that, it removed the CO2 from the atmosphere as well. They might be able to make the air breathable much quicker than first assumed. All they needed was more algae and aquatic life. They also talked about mushrooms and moss to help with the process, which could be spread through drones as they spread the fertilizer over the land.

Adam was impressed as he listened and took notes; they then went into the production part of the terraforming. It had an abundance of the common metals in the system but little of the rare ones, making it not so ideal for mining, but it gave them access to materials for construction. 

Then Jork came up, which surprised Adam. He spoke about what he had the potential to do on the planet out of the limelight of the university and mentioned Adams's new company, which produces ships, drones, and now androids. Then Jork turned to Adam.

“Boss, are you okay with engineer students coming here for an internship?” 

Adam chuckled as he facepalmed for a second, then looked at him and the professors who were looking at him. 

“Hell, if the university wants to rent the wing, they can decide themselves what kind of internships and research projects they would like to do.” 

He could see Professor Jayko eyes brightens at the thought. Min-Na smirked as she knew what would happen, so Adam continued. “I also plan to build a few more bases around the planet. You could be allowed to rent one as a department.”

“We will definitely look into that, yes.” Professor Jayko replied.

Jork smiled and continued, going over a few new patents Adam’s company had made, including a new explorer. Then he turned on the galaxy map to remind them that Dirt lay on the edge of a huge part of the unexplored galaxy. As all the planets explored in this direction, the locally known dead part was like Dirt:  empty. 

The professors suddenly became interested as they could see the potential for exploration and expansion via this new type of terraforming. 

When Jork was finished, Vorts came up and started talking about the potential biological experiments they had started here. Showing them the files of all flora and fauna DNA Adam had brought with him, he then talked about how they had unique chances to experiment and find ideal flora and Fauna that could be a template for these barren worlds. Of course, this meant they needed more personnel and access to high-quality cloning programs.  While Adam could provide funding, he unfortunately did not have access to the hardware and personalities. Something that the university could help with. Of course, if they thought this too much, then Adam and the company could contact other Universities.  Galactic Federation Science and Exploration University (SaSU) was the best, but there would be a less important university that would love to jump on the chance. 

Adam had to hide a smile. Vorts was the final speaker, and he was clearly closing the trap.  When the presentation ended, the professors retired to the Wing to discuss the matter, as Adam had talked with Min-Na. They walked towards the administration but passed it and entered an empty office area; an administration droid and a maid droid were there, making the room ready.

“This room will be your company's office next time you decide to arrive here. We will have three guest rooms ready at any time.” Adam smiled, and she smirked.

“Are you trying to buy our company?” She asked, and Adam winked.

“Not buy, but invest. I bought some stocks, but that is beside the point. As you heard, we might invite companies to come here and work. That means more contracts and work for you guys. “

She leaned on a desk, looked at him, and started to laugh. “Mr. Wrangler, be careful so you don’t grow too big too fast.”

Adam smiled. “I know, it's my biggest worry. Now, I'm simply trying to build defense and protection while overseeing their projects. I feel more like a CEO than a terraformer.”

“You are a CEO and a clan leader. Doing pretty well at it as well.” She moved around the table and sat down. “When do you open for normal colonization?”

“When the defense is up, I feel secure enough to keep it. “ He moved over to the table and started his city blueprint program. His domed city appeared as a hologram.  “I plan to build five of these. Each with a focus on one different type of economics.”

She sat up and stared at it. “You're going to need a lot of people. How many can each city hold?”

“Max capacity is one million, but it is more comfortable at half that size. There is the possibility to expand as well. It’s how we humans build cities on barren planets. But this system allows for the dome to be opened once the air is breathable. It also allows me to make a city for species with different needs for breathing gas to survive.”   She studied the map very interested. 

“What is the time frame for this?”

The five cities will hopefully be ready within 5 to 10 years, depending on how many colonizers we get. I might get unlucky and badly need one. The build of the first is already on the way,” he said, then changed the place to a smaller dome connected to five bigger domes. 

“These are the farm projects we have. Each dome has five fields that would be secured from the environment and allow us to grow flora that needs special environments. Once we get more droids, we will start this project.  The first goal is two, one for flora and one for fauna, so we can produce our own food.  The center dome is a smaller village type with room for about fifty thousand. And the time frame depends on the amount of people living here.”

“So you, why are you showing me these?” She looked at him curiously.

“Because with more people comes more need for the law, lawyers, judges, etc. And I don’t know how that works in this part of the galaxy. From what I understand, there is a trade union that takes care of intergalactic law, right? But the colonies were free to do as they pleased, to a certain point, like freeing slaves, as it interrupted trade.”

“yes, except humanity that, due to its trade exceptions, is allowed to free slaves. But only within your own colonies. You guys were willing to go to war against the whole galaxy because of it. Wait.. oh, that’s the reason.  But they will arrest you!”

“I will need a good lawyer who can defend me. Why do you think I keep you guys around?  I know your company represents several mega-corporations, and I was only allowed to talk to you because of my credit score.”

Min-na grinned slightly. “Yes, and then you surprised us. We see great potential in you and your growing company.” She looked around the office. “I will assign a lawyer to this department permanently. Just a question: when did you realize who we were?”

“When I saw your branch department at the Surga Hub. You’re the vice CEO of a company that spans five sector hubs. Mr Heri-ro-ro is your employee. Why the masquerade? “



“Because you came from nowhere, had the credits, and bought a dead solar system, yet you acted as if you already knew this would work. I simply wanted to get in on the business before the others. If it failed, you could still pay. You never missed your bills yet. But your potential here. Yes, we are talking billions in income if you can make it right. I saw that the first city is a casino one. That will bring in money if you attract the right people.”

Adam sat down opposite her and switched it back to the first city. “Yes, the easiest way to earn money. There are five casino resorts in that city with a small private hangar. I guess you can attract the correct clientele when it is built. It will be legit, so please, no crime lords.”

“She nodded. I can also set up a few investors, but I guess you don’t want that. So, when should we get this up and running?”

“One year. It needs to be built, staffed, and tested.  I will set aside a penthouse for you and an office building. Free of charge.”

“Are you head hunting me? I don’t think you can afford that.” She chuckled, and Adam just smiled.

“Naw, this is just setting up a good business relationship. Oh, find me a judge within that timeframe, somebody who can understand me. There will be a human colony sooner or later, so it can't be somebody pro-slavery.”

She nodded. “It will be my pleasure. Now, let's see if we can get these professors to sign some deals.”

We grabbed coffee and then started to drive up towards the mountain and have a look at the city lights, as I’ve never been at night. We were driving out of our city past the national speed sign and I felt really odd as if we shouldn’t be here and should leave. I mentioned to my partner that we should take the next turn to turn back, he didn’t hear me in time. We continued up the road and I kept feeling shivers, now I’m not a spiritual person by any means. We took a corner and saw what I could only describe as a person, in all high vis, it wasn’t. It was a coat, hate and high vis trousers nailed to a tree. That was really odd but we thought oh it’s just a bad corner up here and you can’t really see it in the dark. As soon as we turned the corner, what seemed like a black German shepherd statue staring at us with red eyes right next to the road, basically seemed as if it was on the road. It wasn’t, its head followed us, we both felt chills and as if we had to turn back and get home asap. This is a main road up the mountain at 1am. Why would a dog be out at this time laying down this close to a main road. We found a place to turn back around and as we were travelling back down the Shepard kept staring at us, really red piercing eyes, and the feeling of utter fear and panic really set in for us both. A car coming towards us kept swerving across the road and once it passed we felt safer. We got off the road and onto the motorway feeling chills and all of a sudden we both felt as if we were going to cry. (We aren’t very emotional people) the dogs face and especially the eyes are stuck in our minds.

I looked it up and apparently it’s a truckers tale, to keep you safe. Always trust the dog, turn around and go home. 

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

I am a 22-year-old girl, and my male friend, who’s about to turn 23, and I have grown close overtime and have strong feeling for each other. Although we live in different countries due to school, we’ve met up for coffee when we’re in the same city. We both want to marry each other and are committed to doing things the halal way (our parents do know about our interest in being potential spouses but it’s not super serious). University and finances are our only obstacles right now so we decided to remain friends with the intention of marriage until we are in a place in our lives to actually do so.

When we first discussed marriage, he mentioned that if I had a past, he’d rather not know, but it would be a dealbreaker if I was not a virgin as he has preserved his own chastity and never been close to a girl before. Until I was 20, I had never been close to a guy. Then, a friend introduced me to someone and it quickly turned into a haram relationship. I felt pressured into dating because “friends” would comment that I was “behind” and should get some experience. I was a bit of a people pleaser so I ended up being with him for about 2 months, we kissed a few times, but I never enjoyed being with him and felt guilty afterward. I take full responsibility for my actions, I feel ashamed and have repented every night since then. 

Recently, when discussing dealbreakers again, he mentioned that if I had done anything with another guy at all, he would most likely end things and maybe cut me off. 

I believed that if someone truly repented and quit that sin, their past wouldn’t matter. But I’ve started seeing posts mentioning if someone has done something that’s on another’s list of dealbreakers, they should end things but make an excuse as to not reveal the sin.

I’m conflicted. I want to be with him, we have both never felt this way about anyone, and I know me leaving would hurt us both. But I don’t want to do anything that might upset Allah or lead to something worse if we do end up together. I don’t know if this situation is a punishment, a lesson, a test, but I want to make the right choice that’s best for us both.

I’m working hard to strengthen my relationship with Allah and become a better Muslim. Am I in denial, should I just end our friendship now? Any advice on how to proceed would be deeply appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1730173004.0,islam,1,1.0,False

The volume of the tension is louder than I ever could have imagined. My heart is stalling like an engine begging for gas. I'm sure you can see it. You know how I feel about you. I wish I knew how you felt. Where you found the off switch to make all of the passion go numb. The space between us is so little, but when we're together it just feels so far. I dread the day you move on to someone else and forget about me. I'll be happy for you. As long as you're happy. I crave the feeling of your fingers tracing my hands. To be able to hold you. It feels like you're trying to push me further and further. That may just be me. You told me I was the right person at the wrong time. I promised I'd wait. I'd be there always. I'd support all of your decisions. I don't want you in another universe. Not in an alternate reality. I want you. I want all of the flaws. I want everything that makes you who you are. I didn't fall in love with the idea of who you could be. I fell in love with you. It's so difficult not to tell you that, but I know that's the last thing you want to hear right now. We still see each other often. We sit on the couch playing Minecraft or watching Ru Paul's Drag Race. We'll go out for coffee or run some errands, because I know the kiddos keep you busy. I trust you with all of my heart. You stole my heart. Please take care of it. I only write when I'm hurting, because it gives me an outlet to talk about my feelings. Even though you gave me confidence going into my interview and spent the morning with me, I lie here wondering what you see. If you still see anything in me. I hug you hello and I hug you goodbye, but I never want to say goodbye. I never want to let go. If you told me to leave, I would. I just want to know if it's us at the end of this road, or if it's me - and you. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll continue to hide the pain I'm feeling for your sake.

The 2 games are between the Dallas Stars and the Florida Panthers, this means that residents of 2 of the USA’s more notorious states will be galivanting around Finland.

Things to know:

1.      There are Texans and Floridians who do bite, but it is unlikely that those people will be going to a hockey game in Finland.

2.      Temperature: Florida and Texas are on the same latitudinal lines as the Sahara Desert. It was 32 C in Dallas today. So if you see an American huddled, shivering and whimpering, kindly point them to the nearest coffee shop or similar venue.

3.      Conversation: it is entirely possible that someone who you have NEVER met before may strike up a casual conversation with you. Do not be alarmed. If you are determined to not have a conversation, just say you don’t speak English, though this may cause some Americans to speak slowly and loudly in Spanish.

4.      American personal space is 1ish meter, Finnish personal space is like 2-3 meters. Sorry. We’ll be gone in a week.

5.      The Dallas Stars and Florida Panthers are both very good teams; this match up could have been the Stanley Cup finals last year or maybe even this year. That being said, there is not really a rivalry between the two teams and the US doesn’t do hooliganism outside of Philly.",2,1730172555.0,Finland,3,0.58,False

I (26F), have been friends with my (26M) guy best friend (lets call him Sam, not his real name) since middle school. We were great friends with each other, and regularly talked and hanged out. I will admit Sam has always been a nice/nerdy guy, and he was a little chubby. Not like overweight or anything, he just had a little  belly bulge. Throughout my middle school and high school years he would help tutor me on subjects like science and math. Now me and Sam have always seen each other as friends. There was one time I admit that I had a tiny crush on him, and I'm sure he probably liked me back back in high school but we never really talked about it and we just moved on from it. 

Eventually we split ways in high school when he went to Caltech, while I went to University of Nevada, Reno (Go Wolf Pack!). We kept in touch and texted each other throughout college. I came back to my hometown after finishing my BA, and working as a Finical Analyst. Sam stayed in Caltech to complete his Masters and came back throughout the breaks. I began noticing some changes with him. He appeared more fit and more relaxed. The way he acted was completely different he was more confident and more calm than I remembered. I brushed it off thinking it was a new phase. After he completed his Masters & PhD, he moved back and re-lived in his parent's house. We met for coffee, Throughout the entire time, he was quite levelheaded and was very humble. He was very muscular and very fit. I asked him about work, He said he was working as a Principal Data Scientist for a Tech Firm. I shared some bits about me, and we promised to keep in touch. We've been meeting up for coffee every Saturday for about a couple of months. 

It's very sweet, and I love him so much. I've been trying to flirt with him and sometimes he responds with something to that level, but other times not so much. I've been trying to give him more physical affections like hugging, and holding/touching his hand, but he usually just takes it. He sometimes gives it back but I have a feeling he's doing it only to be friendly. 

We've talked about our past relationships, he's said he has only had one relationship in the past with some girl at Caltech. He said it didn't last long due to her breaking it up. He said he's only waiting till marriage. I talked about my previous relationships. I expressed how much I didn't like them and wanted to be with someone more secure emotionally. He chuckled at this and he said the same here. Every passing moment, I fall in love with him more. 

Another thing I should mention, he is Indian, and I am Pakistani. We have rarely ever discussed the politics of our origin countries as we feel it doesn't matter in our relationship. My parents don’t have an issue of Sam(Not his real name) being Hindu and us being muslim. But I’m not sure about him. 

This leads to the question, I should or shouldn’t ask Sam out?

Get a 4 dollar ride request, pick up location is some assisted living/senior living facility. Rider sends the first message, ""please come to the back entrance please ty u have pink shoes."".

That just didn't sit right with me, I do late night rides all the time, but asking to be picked up in the rear of the huge facility, and then saying, "" I am wearing pink shoes."". Instead of ""I am wearing a purple coat/blue jacket"" etc.. who's looking at people SHOES to identify them? Not me. 

So I stop at a red light and I reply, ""sounds a bit suss but okay"". Rider messages back, ""I will cancel its OK and get another driver."". 

Light is still red, so I reply, ""I'm literally down the block."". Then Rider says ""I'm at work I'm a nurse I was going to get drinks but it's ok."".

Like a morning coffee run for the other staff, no biggie, I get it. I hit the gas when the light turns green, I'm a block away from the location, Rider cancels, I'm given a cancel fee since I was so close, whatever. 

But this is 3 in the morning on a Sunday night/Monday morning, on the southwest side of OKC near Moore, I'm like the only dude in the area. This lady requests and cancels a ride FOUR. TIMES. Each time the ride pops up, I see it, accept since I'm literally right there, she sees it's me, then cancels. At this point there's no cancel fee, but it isn't about money anymore it's about being a nuisance. So yeah, ride pops up, I accept, I try to enter the chat box with ""Hey, me again."". But poor Tonya keeps canceling. I was double apping on Lyft and I'm pretty sure Tonya was also running into me again. Whoops. 

Lady, I'm the ONLY guy in the area, you're gonna have to suck it up or start right foot-left footing it in your pink shoes to OnCue for coffee. And she probably did. 

Eventually after the fourth request I get another ride from some woman in Norman for 17 bucks so I took off and went to go deal with that (which wasn't even profitable and I had to cancel on that Rider since it was some 3rd party ride for a literal dope fiend who didn't have the 4 digit security code. But Uber actually reimbursed me when I requested compensation for time and gas wasted driving out to Norman.)

Tonya, next time you pop up on my radar I'll be looking for those pink shoes.",1,1730172249.0,uberdrivers,0,0.67,False

They are a Da Nang-based roaster that sources a lot of high-end auction lots (of exclusively washed process coffees I believe) and they roast in an ultralight style, a step lighter than the Nordic usual suspects... the kind of coffee that can handle months of rest and brews up super delicate and tea-like. I've been curious to try them again but couldn't figure out their online store, since Southeast Asian e-commerce is a bit different (they use QR codes for paying). Anyway, I emailed them today to ask what the process is to order from the US, and to my surprise I got a reply back in like half an hour with instructions and details. Shipping is steep, but I'm thinking about grabbing a couple bags of kooky competition grade coffees as a Christmas present to myself.

I was about to give up, until I matched with someone local. 

We got on amazing via text, we met for coffee which felt so normal, he took me out for a meal for my birthday.

I’ve been away for the past 10 days and he came over when I got home, he even met my family who were at my house at the time (brave man) 

He will never replace my husband and he knows that but he cares about me deeply and I feel the same.

I’m only 37 and my husband and I had some very adult conversations when I was diagnosed with terminal cancer I said when I died I wanted him to move forward and find happiness again and he wanted the same for me.

The world is broken he should have never died he was fit and well and one day just collapsed and that was it, they couldn’t bring him back.

So in my mind I started to get anxious as they’re taking orders ahead of me, I backed out before someone could block me in behind rather than awkwardly ask if they had regular coffee (in my head I was thinking they would say no then I would have to furiously scan the menu for some drink that I’d order and throw away).

I‘m more reserved than her, so when I talk about my task, I go to the point without babbling about it for 10 minutes like her. But I definitely like my task, I’m good about it, and don‘t plan on leaving anytime soon, so my job is not for sale!
She had already mentioned to me that she loves my project and would prefer it over hers.
It annoys me how openly she is now promoting herself as the new „expert“ on my task. I have self-confidence issues too, so she makes me feel threatened. We had a friendly relationship until now, but now I feel she no longer wants to be friends and is only interested in getting my job.
I‘m thinking to take her for a coffee and ask her politely to stop this. I hope she won’t pick up on the fact that she threatens me and interpret it as a sign of weakness.

Or should I just ignore her? Or talk to our boss about it?

1gel0y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gel0y6/mf_breaking_bernie/,[MF] Breaking Bernie,"The smartest in the room, Peter migrated to Brunswick during the great hipster renaissance. It was a period in time when manicured beards and lumberjack suspenders were the rage. The trend dissipated many years ago, but his egotistical self-righteous attitude remains.

A senior project officer for The Thirteenth Disciple, his mission is to search for racist, homophobic, or offensive material, and then humiliate the responsible entity into submission. A simple strategy and for a devout atheist, he’s doing God’s work and doesn’t care about the consequences.

‘The confectionery company! They’re morally bankrupt.’ Peter says, spinning his chair to face Nancy. ‘That f-word is offensive in every language.’

‘Well, that being said, let’s give them a dose of humble pie.’ Disgusted by the revelation, Nancy snaps a pencil in half. ‘There’s nothing better than seeing senior executives cry.’

In her mid-twenties, Nancy has a double degree in economics and law but insists she’s an out-of-work actress. With one eye on Hollywood and the other on Peter, she flourishes in her role. Her ruthless tendencies are considered an exceptional quality and highly admired. Promotion is a given and favouritism works to her advantage.

‘That’s why I hired you.’ With a cheeky grin, Peter smiles and adores Nancy’s unyielding passion. ‘Your tenacity fascinates me.’

‘I do my best.’ Nancy twirls her hair and blushes. ‘For your information, I’m not here for my good looks.’

Giddy with lust, Peter whispers a few sweet words into Nancy’s ear and the two lovebirds discuss the detrimental effects of semantics in postmodernity. The intellectual hubris stirs the juices and unable to withhold her admiration, Nancy leans forward and kisses Peter on the cheek.

But cometh the moment, Peter stays frigid. Afraid to pursue a workplace relationship, he prefers to discuss Bernie’s tenure. The harsh words boost his self-esteem and Nancy loves the inherent bitterness. Emboldened, she insists there’s no room in The Thirteenth Disciple for anybody born before 1975.

‘Bernie is a living fossil. A relic from the past.’ Peter says and the hate for the old man festers. ‘He should have retired ten years ago.’

‘Well, the boomer is ancient.’ Nancy replies with a self-satisfied smirk and sips her coffee.

Older than the combined age of the two, Bernie lets the kids play in the sandpit. An original social justice campaigner, he struggles to understand their methods and prefers a softer approach than the current passive-aggressive destructionism. By far the longest-serving employee, he’s seen pessimism dominate the organisation.

‘You know, it was Hymen Lipman.’ Bernie bursts into the boardroom and grabs the snapped pencil from the floor. ‘He was the first person to place a rubber on top of a pencil and you better put one on your little Johnny.’

‘Bernie, seriously? This isn’t the time,’ Nancy snaps, her patience wearing thin. ‘Get out and stop harassing us.’

Exhausted from the constant humiliation, Bernie walks the plank. The clash between naive idealism and seasoned wisdom has a clear victor and reading the room, Bernie packs his bags and grabs his coat. Peter smiles, and for the first time, victory feels shallow. The moment falls flat and the less empathetic Nancy laughs.

‘Just because you’re educated doesn’t mean you are smart.’ Bernie says and heads for the exit. ‘I’m too old to play your games.’

For all his bravado, there’s a nagging awareness that their conquests are hollow. Unwavering, Nancy’s confidence remains steady. She stares at her reflection in the dimmed window and sees a determined woman. A proud member of the actors’ guild, she shifts uncomfortably in her chair, flicks her hair and finds no value in dead wood floating around the office.

‘This is not an old man’s home.’ Nancy says and high-fives Peter. ‘Nothing can save him, not even human resources.’

‘Hopefully, that’s the last we see of him.’ Peter runs his fingers across Nancy’s lips. ‘Once he’s gone your promotion is assured. Welcome to the senior ranks.’

Like many of his peers, Peter has a Masters Degree and his useless thesis sits in the bottom drawer collecting dust. Nobody is interested in the life cycles of amphibians. A great topic for frog lovers, but the substantial student debt worries him. Despite his Master’s degree, Peter is trapped in a job he never wanted.

’Unbelievable, they’ve beaten us to the punch.’ Peter wipes his brow and punches the wall. ‘They’ve rebranded their product. How dare they preempt us.’

Disappointed but determined to get his way, Peter seeks vengeance. He needs a victory and targets the weakest link. Poor Bernie, with no social label to protect him, the old man is locked out of the building. Nancy cancels his pass and empties his desk.

‘We should have sacked him last year.’ Nancy replies and sees an opportunity that’s been nagging her for months. ‘Let’s target my local cafe. They are selling Negrita Coffee by the bucket load.’

‘So long as they don’t label a short black a Sammy Davis.’ Peter replies and dismisses Nancy’s grievance. ‘Black in any language is a colour and not always associated with racism.’

Outside, Bernie pauses to take a deep breath and vows to channel his experience into a new chapter. Everything must end, but for Peter and Nancy, they savour the moment. They revel in their power, their egos inflated by each conquest, yet the hollowness of their actions matter little. From one target to the next, they leave a trail of broken spirits and shattered lives. 

 The End.

1gel0d8,https://i.redd.it/bgh1adbk3mxd1.jpeg,Daily Song Discussion #93: Cook Of The House,"he song was written by Paul and Linda McCartney in Adelaide in November 1975, during the Wings Over The World Tour.

"" ‘No matter where I serve my guests, they seem to like the kitchen best’. That was a sign in the kitchen of a house we were renting somewhere; I seem to remember it was Australia, probably during the Wings Over The World tour before our son James was born. So it would have been Linda, Heather, Mary, Stella and me all staying together.

That was a fun thing Linda remembered – and this is basically Linda’s song with a bit of help from me. At this time, in Wings, everyone in the band had a song on the album, so this was hers from At The Speed Of Sound. Sometimes with a song you just look around and you name all the stuff you can see, and in this case she went round all the spices – cinnamon, garlic, curry powder – because, as a family, we spent a lot of time in the kitchen getting our hands dirty. Linda was a very good cook and loved feeding our family and friends, so it was fitting that her song would be ‘Cook Of The House’."" -Paul McCartney
The Lyrics: 1956 To The Present

The song was recorded on 4 February 1976 at Abbey Road Studios. It was completed two weeks later at the McCartneys’ London home, 7 Cavendish Avenue, with the addition of the sound of bacon and chips being fried in oil.

""We went round to our house with the mobile unit and Linda decided to cook a meal and get cooking sounds recorded, and then fed the meal to us and the engineers. We all had a laugh and a drink. The mobile was outside the house and we just ran wires into the kitchen. Take one. Bacon frying. The first British cooking on record. There are chips at the end, which is great because it sounds like applause. If you get any questions you can tell them it was an E flat bacon pan and Seimer chips!' -Paul McCartney
Press conference, 25 March March 1976





""This song has a simple, classic rock and roll sound, basically three chords with a fourth thrown in at the turnaround between the chorus and verse. It could have been recorded anytime between 1950 and now. Not everyone would have been inclined to kick off the song with the sound of bacon frying in the key of E-flat. That’s what makes it special. Also, the bass I’m playing here used to belong to Bill Black, Elvis Presley’s bass player, so that legacy contributes to the vintage feel."" -Paul McCartney
The Lyrics: 1956 To The Present



‘Silly Love Songs’ was released as a single in April 1976, with ‘Cook Of The House’ on the b-side. It peaked at number two in the UK but topped the US charts, and became one of the biggest-selling singles of the year.

Wings performed ‘Cook Of The House’ during their UK tour in 1979.

I made it through Monday’s chaos, coffee in hand, thinking Tuesday would bring relief. But Tuesday was like, “Oh, you thought?” It’s not the start of the week, but it’s definitely not close enough to Friday to bring me peace. It’s basically the weird middle child of the week, just hanging around with nothing good to offer.

At this rate, I’m thinking of declaring Wednesday as “pre-pre-Friday” just to feel something. Until then, I’ll be over here with my fifth coffee, trying to pretend this grind is fulfilling.",1,1730171160.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

**The Problem:**
As someone who uses multiple AI models daily, I got frustrated with:
- Juggling different apps and subscriptions
- Slow/clunky web interfaces
- Limited customization options
- Monthly subscriptions adding up

**The Solution:**
I built LLMConnect, a native iOS client that:
- Connects to OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter APIs
- Lets you create custom AI assistants and roleplay bots
- Stores everything locally
- Offers a one-time purchase instead of subscriptions

**Tech Stack:**
- Built entirely in SwiftUI
- Fully native implementation (no WebViews!)
- Local storage for privacy
- Clean MVVM architecture

**Cool Features:**
- Create custom assistants
- Build roleplay bots with persistent personas
- Archive and pin important conversations
- Use your own API keys for cost control

The app took lots of coffee and late-night coding sessions. It's now live on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/llmconnect/id6737247302)!

**Next Steps:**
- Adding more API providers
- Image generation support
- Voice interactions
- Community-requested features

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! As a first-time app developer, this has been quite the journey, and I'm excited to keep improving it based on user needs.",1,1730171126.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

I'm here to drop some knowledge, some insight, and a sprinkle of humor on the matter at hand. Today, we're diving into the beautiful tale of Colin Farrell pounding the pavement like an Irish Riverdancer at a high-stepping competition. This isn't just any story, folks; it’s one soaked in friendship, perseverance, and a dash of hometown glory.

Now, let's lace up those running shoes and hit the ground running. First, let me say this: If there were an Olympic event for bromance—or in this case, friendship across sexes—Colin would be bringing home the gold. The man ran a marathon! And not just any marathon—The Dublin Marathon—to honor his dear friend Emma Fogarty, who holds the remarkable title of the longest-surviving individual in Ireland with a rare genetic condition. That's friendship that could melt the ice in an Irish coffee. 

Now, about the article itself: It’s a sweet and concise narrative, giving us the warm fuzzies and reaffirming our faith in humanity. But 2,744 more characters would have done wonders in fleshing this out to a real-thigh slap of a story. Give me more about the nuances of their friendship! The training, the triumphs, the tears shed at that finish line where sweat met sentimentality.

Is this a valid expression of camaraderie? You bet your lucky charms it is! The world is so often bereft of such shining examples of what it means to be there for the people we care about. Beyond the glitz, glamour, and Hollywood shenanigans, this shows the true heart of Colin Farrell—a man driven by compassion as much as talent.

In conclusion, my friends, this article not only inspires but also compels us to ponder on how we can be better mates to our fellow humans. Take a page from Colin’s book and run—don’t walk—towards whatever or whoever makes your heart race.

Remember, dear viewers, a marathon is long and arduous, much like this journey we call life. But with friends like Emma and Colin, there's always strength in each stride. Give a hand, lend an ear, or pound the pavement for someone you care about. That's a message worth running with.

Stay classy and kind-hearted, folks. Until next time, this has been Clyde McDive—and you know it’s Live at 5!",1,1730171096.0,u_Bstillbstill23,0,1.0,False

I'm always told ""oh it doesn't matter if you don't burp"" by people who obviously have no IDEA what it's like to bloat up like a puffer fish until you feel like your going to have a heart attack from pain, and all you can do is wait. I've told every doc I've gone to across 2 states and 4 cities and all of them just don't even react or ask questions they basically just tell me to shut up and stop wasting their time because clearly, the condition just isn't real and if it was, it isn't important. I was so excited a few years ago when I finally found the name for what I'd been trying to tell people but now I'm just even more upset because I've confirmed something is wrong with me but there's utterly nothing I can do.

I've been trying to learn to force myself to burb but I can stick my hands down my throat and it does nothing aside make me choke. I have to be truly dying in order to throw up even the tiniest bit of air/liquid and my body reacts by closing my throat to the point that I cannot breath in order to stop me from releasing my stomach content. I'm so tired. Lately I've been having chest pain and pressure in my throat and I genuinly can't tell if it's the air in my stomach or I'm about to die young from an actual heart attack.

I don't even want to bother going to a doctor over it because if it is air in my stomach they will just tell me they don't care. Is there just a way I can like, shove something down my throat to literally pry open my stomach, I just want to not be in pain. I have to constantly drown my system in coffee because if I get constipated for a single moment I will be in so much pain from gas that I will collapse and be forced to writhe in pain until it clears up.

I have tried to sus this out during Coffee Chats, however I usually only get surface level answer (i.e. ""we are REALLY busy"", or ""we have highs and lows""). While I definitely understand what they are talking about, I want to know what this REALLY means - especially since I potentially have to make a decision about whether I want this life soon, with interview week around the corner. 

Also, more than a handful of times during my coffee chats, I get one or two partners saying ""yeah I still have time for video games""...and I wonder how to fit this into the ""Big Law is the most fast paced thing you will ever do in your entire life, many try but few stay past 2 years"" vibe I also get. 

So my questions are:

1. Do you get to workout every day in Big Law? What does that workout consist of (i.e. do you get 1 hour in the gym? Or do you consider putting your desk in ""standing mode"" your workout for the day?)? 



2. I am aware that the large salaries of biglaw come with the implicit/explicit requirement that you be responsive 24/7. But I am wondering - how often does this entail that you actually have to power on your laptop at 11 PM, or even 1 AM or later - because you got an email saying that your boss needs something on their desk ASAP/by 8 AM that morning? How often have you had to essentially lose an ENTIRE weekend because of work (not just a couple hours on Saturday and Sunday)? How often have you ACTUALLY put in an all nighter in the office? 




3. How do biglaw teams usually handle one of their associates going through a personal emergencies? (i.e. what if one of my parents die during a major deal? Will I be allowed to travel home for at least 1 week without getting major shit? Or what if I get a text one day that my wife is delivering?). Obviously I imagine this is firm specific or even group specific - but I am wondering what the general consensus is surrounding things like this.",4,1730170018.0,LawCanada,6,0.84,False

I'm also listening to. Music all the time. I'm into pop, indie and edm so I have a pretty wide range of musical interests. 

I'm very chill, I have a wild sense of humor and love talking. Like a lot. If you're looking for someone to bother you, that'd be me. I'm not too concerned about where you're from, what stage of life you're in or how you got here but shoot me a chat and let's get to. Know each other. Short term or long term, I'm down. I'm not looking for immediate NSFW chats or anything like that so feel free to skip over this if that's your goal. 

But ya, stop by my chats and yap a while! ",2,1730169565.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

So I've been saving up to get my mom a nice Christmas gift this year, and she loves coffee (she has one everyone morning). Recently, there was a sort of raffle (you text a number and that's your entry) for a Nespresso machine, which she lost and was a little bummed (she was expecting to lose but ya know, you get your hopes up a little). I noticed her disappointment, so I was thinking about getting her the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+, but I was wondering if it's worth the investment or if I should get her something else. Just worried about the cost because my family is always trying to save money, but I thought it would be nice to make her feel special. I saw that you can get reusable pods to put your own coffee in too, so maybe that could save money because I heard the pods can get expensive.

I Will Always Love You,"My husband died of a heart attack on February 2, 2015; he was 60 years old. That morning, he drove our youngest daughter, who was 16, to the bus stop because it was dark and raining outside. When he came home, we sat and had a cup of coffee together. At 7 a.m., he went into our bedroom to shower and get ready for work. I told him I’d give him half an hour before I would come in to take my shower.

When I did, I found him dead on the bathroom floor. His skin was grey, his eyes open, his glasses on, and his body twisted as if he had collapsed. I tried to get a response, then started chest compressions. Nothing. I called for my dad, who was in the kitchen, to call 911. When help arrived, it was a police officer, then later EMTs.

The officer tried to give him a shock with those paddles, but it wouldn’t go off at all to provide the shock; he was gone, unresponsive. The EMTs couldn’t get his heart started either. He was dead. I was in shock. We had been together for 22 years and married for 17.5 years. He was the love of my life, my soulmate. The doctor at the hospital said he died instantly; he wouldn’t have known what was happening, and he didn’t feel any pain. I’m so much regretful that I didn’t have the chance to talk to him in his last breaths. God, at least once…

A week after his passing, a female friend of mine was helping me go through my husband’s things in our bedroom. I was standing by his side of the bed, gathering up papers and mail from his nightstand. I turned and looked up toward the hallway that was between the bathroom and a little dressing room where our closets were. I saw a dark shadow step out of the bathroom into the hallway and turn toward me, about 15 feet away.

We have been married for two years. For most of that time I worked full time and he worked part time; but he has occasionally picked up extra shifts. We both have mental health struggles, go to therapy and have a fantastic support system with our family. There is no doubt in my mind that we are happy together. 

What’s tripping me up is that throughout the last year I have been focusing on wanting to go out to dinner together so we are getting out of the house for other reasons besides work and to take the pressure of cooking off of us occasionally. He isn’t keen and has said this is either because we don’t have money or because he isn’t the type of person who wants to go out. What I’m hearing that he isn’t saying is that he just actually doesn’t want to go out. Now… If he doesn’t want to go out, I am aware I can go out by myself or with friends but I am reluctant and feel he will be hurt or mad at me. More details on that in additional info section. 

I left my job earlier this year as I couldn’t cope anymore. Up until that point I had this mindset that I needed to work as hard as possible and make as much money as I could. I ended up burning out and living off my savings when I left my job until I could get back on my feet.

When I was working full time I was very tired and didn’t do much outside of work. For the last few months I have mostly left the house for work purposes as I’ve taken a leading role in our business so I have a focus. Whilst it does well, it doesn’t do well enough to support both of us so my husband is still in his part time job that he really doesn’t like. 

More often than not in our marriage I would organise dinner even on the days he wasn’t working. I would get annoyed when I would get home from work and realise he hadn’t even thought to organise anything. When I would ask what we should do for dinner, he says  without fail “I don’t know”. 

On days that I had a hard day at work and he hadn’t organised anything, I would ask if we can go out and he would say no. Keep in mind I don’t ask him to pay when we go out. (We don’t have shared finances but we go half in all bills and I pay for food shopping on top of that). I have even at times tried to make cooking schedules and that hasn’t worked either. The wanting to go out is for a change of scenery and spending time together as well as taking that “what to cook” decision off of my brain. 

If I don’t cook, he will not eat or get take away. 

Since I left my job, I have asked many times for us to go out. I have suggested coffee and cake, using our membership to the zoo to get in for free, mini golf gift vouchers we have for free games and even making food and going to the beach to eat dinner. These in my opinion are low cost outings and once again I would be paying as I really want to go. 

His response is it costs money to get there aka in fuel. I have also mentioned if he didn’t get take away or drive to the servo to get soft drinks almost daily it would save money too. Not much has changed on that front. 

Last night I brought up the wanting to go out thing again and he mentioned that we don’t have savings and we need money behind us as we won’t be able to cope if something unexpected comes up. I agree with this. I also feel I need something fun to do and I want to have outings with him. 

My question is, what can we do together out of the house that doesn’t cost money? 

TLDR: I want to do low cost fun things with my husband outside the house but he always says no as they cost money. I feel he doesn’t actually want to go out. Regardless… Anyone have any outing suggestions I can pitch to him? 

ADDITIONAL INFO: Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD. Despite my best efforts to push through and keep working, I ended up having a break down and my medical assessment was that I can no longer work full time hours. My job couldn’t accommodate the part time hours I could work in the position I was in and moved me to another role and location. I was bullied badly at the new location and left the job as it made my mental health much worse. In my last two weeks of working in that job I asked my husband to organise dinner as I could barely cope showing up in a workplace that I felt were nasty to me. He didn’t take care of dinner. I was really hurt by this as I felt unsupported when I expressed what I needed to get through that difficult time.

I put my focus into our side business which does well but not well enough to support us both. I always cover my own bills and half of our shared cost of living. I am really using this time to focus on my recovery and build up our business rather than get another job working for someone else. I never want to feel as low and unwell as I did when I broke down last year so I’m focused on getting better. 

A couple of weeks ago I mentioned again that I want to go out for dinner sometime and got the same “we have no money” response. A couple of days later my brother asked me out for dinner with my parents and offered to pay. I didn’t invite my husband, like I always do, because he had made it clear once again that we couldn’t afford to go out and I felt that me bringing up going out again once he reset the same boundary would be seen as me not listening to him. I also wasn’t sure who would pay for my husband to attend. He then told me he was really hurt when he wasn’t invited. I feel like I have to make decisions in lose lose situations where there is no right choice. Sure I can go out with other people I suppose, but this situation has made me very reluctant now because I think will he be hurt if I go out without him or will he be mad because I’m spending money when we have no savings. 

I have always had a weekly budget and cut expenses where ever I can. I also sell my belongings weekly to get extra money. I’ve done this before we were married also. We also do car boot sales together. My husband has applied for other jobs but with no success. 

We don’t share finances because my husband spends money on random things. He recently broached the topic that we could combine our bank accounts and I thought about it. When I agreed, he felt funny about it and neither of us know why. So we haven’t combined our finances.

I’m a high school senior with an idea for a social app, and I’d love to get feedback on whether this idea could actually work in the market. My goal is to create a platform that makes it easy for people to make, share, and interact with rankings and tier lists on just about anything. This could be anything from sports and food to games, countries, animals—literally whatever people want to rank! Here’s a breakdown of my vision and features:

# Core Concept

* **Convenient Tier List Creation**: Users (or ""creators"") can make and publish their own tier lists, with tools for quickly setting up, editing, and sharing lists with others. The app would offer a smooth, organized process for creating lists, making it quick and easy to share opinions and rankings.
* **Social Interaction**: Users can invite friends to view and rank lists, creating “live ranking games” where friends rank items in real-time.
* **Wide Topic Range**: The goal is to allow people to rank and share anything they’re passionate about, from ranking pizza toppings to favorite vacation spots or video game characters.

# Features Breakdown

1. **Polls and Ratings**: Each tier list could include polls for users to rate and discuss specific rankings. This could help determine which lists or items are most agreed upon or controversial.
2. **Tournaments**: Think bracket-style tournaments where items go head-to-head, with users voting until there’s a final winner. This could be a fun, competitive way to determine “ultimate” rankings.
3. **Trending & Community Highlights**: A section that showcases popular or controversial lists, as well as trending topics (like ranking Oscar nominees or best Halloween movies during October).
4. **Collaborative Lists**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on a single tier list, great for group discussions or events where everyone contributes to the rankings.
5. **Achievement Badges & Analytics**: Gamify the experience with badges for creating popular lists or voting in tournaments, and provide creators with analytics (views, likes, etc.) to see which lists gain traction.
6. **Daily/Weekly Themes**: Provide users with a “Daily Ranking Challenge” on various topics (e.g., “Best Fall Foods” in autumn), encouraging participation around trending themes.
7. **Interactive Comments**: Users could comment on specific items within a tier list, sparking discussions or debates over the rankings.

**End Goal**  
The ultimate goal of the app is to provide a convenient, engaging platform where people can easily make and share lists or rankings on any topic. Whether you’re curious about someone’s favorite coffee flavors or want to settle which NBA player is the GOAT, this app would be a place for it.

**Questions**  
Is this kind of app something you’d be interested in? Do you think people would use it? Also, if anyone has insight into making it marketable, I’d love your advice!
