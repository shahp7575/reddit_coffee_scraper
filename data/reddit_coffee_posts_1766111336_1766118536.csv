( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Carol: What is your favorite food?

Zosia: >!\[whisking stops\] Mango ice cream. I love mango ice cream. \[chuckles\]!<

>!There was an old man in my neighborhood who sold it out of a little cart. I would watch the ships leaving Gdańsk. Brand new. First voyage.!<

>!I was maybe… ten years old? And I was fascinated by these giant ships. Who built them? What for? Where were they going?!<

**And now I know.**

>!\[inhales sharply\] Sometimes, the man with the cart would hand out ice cream bars to us!<  
>!when he had too many to sell. He knew we didn't have two coins to rub together. It was just after the country had opened up, and suddenly he had new flavors. Mint, coffee, peach. But… \[chuckles\] …mango, that was my favorite. \[chuckles\] \[both chuckle softly\]!<

>!Carol: Thank you for sharing that. \[unsettling music playing\] Zosia?!<

>!Zosia: \[inhales sharply\] You're going to have a visitor.!<

Lots of people have remarked on the moment where we wonder if Carol is sparking the individuality of original Zosia: she’s noticeably better at the “I” pronoun, and we see Zosia>!freeze!<but right before she says >!someone’s coming,!<very much like in the earlier episode >!with Diabete about to get a visit from Carol.!<

But what I wonder about is the memory itself!  This was a good episode for frank explanation about the nature of the Pluribus/hive.  The part I find most interesting is when Zosia says “and now I know”:

Who is the “I” that knows?  The mind that remembers the child’s questions also has all the answers from the view of the ice cream seller, so what does that mean about this mind now?  Interestingly, Zosia continues to dwell on the personal individual memory, rather than go all Wikipedia on the political and economic history of Poland.  Is this genuine, manipulative, some combination of the two?

Now this scene also reminds me of Carol’s sharp point about Bri the waitress having her own life in Miami—in which Carol was completely unimportant—pulled out from under her feet by the Joining, so that now she’s airlifted back to Albuquerque to playact on a freshly made stage for Carol’s emotional appeasement (or distraction or both).  Just how tragic that is for Bri.  Therefore likewise for original Zosia.

I was at a local cafe few days ago, and there was a girl who standing at counter looking other way to ask her friends what to get. I just went ahead and placed my order (it's a local cafe so queues don't matter) and I said ""One cold coffee. One chocolate ice cream."" And she gasped, SHE GASPED LIKE HELL.

She was so much shocked to hear my voice. I felt bad for her to scare her like that, I immediately said ""sorry"" she didn't say anything, embarrassed innocent soul 😭😭😭. But later I also laughed a lot lmaooo.

Another incident. I was with my friends. Most evil scoundrels on this planet. We were in burger king and ordered a few burgers. Waiter was a woman, she brought us a burger and someone ordered a cake. I just asked for a spoon ""Can I have a spoon please?"" And because of that deep voice she made such frowning face like she was going to kill me. Plus I was with these bastards they immediately said ""No, bro come on don't be so rude. You could have asked politely."" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Even in college I went to professor to hand in my assignments for audit course. I was late because of practicals of other subjects. I went in there ""Sir, here is assignment, I apologise for being late."" No rude here right? Polite language. Bro literally said to me ""Don't brigade into my office like that to intimidate me, first you are late and now you are intimidating me to take your assignments?"" 😭 I was literally super polite this time 😭😭 what should I say to people now? ""Your royal highness""?😭😭

Let's not even start about dating. I went on a date, she politely said that she isn't interested. I was fine. Later on I found out she said that I am rude person. I know what incidents she's referring to. It was late after date and she wanted auto, I couldn't drop her since the date spot was near my area. So I went to autowala and asked him, he asked for much larger fare, I just said ""Meter se chalo na"" that's it. Plus when we were in cafe during date, so same waiter thing must've happened.

Lol I know it's funny reading all of this 😭😭😭. But you no idea how situation gets difficult when you have satan dressed up as your friends.

There’s something oddly satisfying about tapping your Nopa Move, opening the web-app, and seeing your reuse count climb. It turns reuse into something visible — not just a “nice thing” you hope you’re doing enough of.

The NFC chip is the quiet hero here. No scanning QR codes, no explaining yourself at the counter. Just tap, check in, done. Your bottle does the talking.

This space exists because reuse shouldn’t feel like a chore. It should feel normal, rewarding, and a little bit fun. Tracking your own impact — coffee by coffee — is a big part of that.

So if you’re new here: welcome.

If you’ve been here a while: go check your numbers.

And if you’re low-key proud of your reuse streak… yeah, you’re among friends.

Alright, this one’s important.

The new **Nopa web-app** is live, and it changes how you see your bottle. Instead of reuse being an abstract idea, you now get a **clear record of how often you’ve actually reused** your Nopa Move.

Tap your NFC chip → check in → your reuse count updates.

Simple. Clean. No app clutter.

What we love about this is that it doesn’t guilt-trip you. It doesn’t tell you to “do better.” It just shows you what you’ve already done. And honestly? That feels pretty good.

A lot of us didn’t realize how often we were reusing until the numbers showed up. Turns out small daily habits add up fast when coffee is involved.

If you’ve been carrying your bottle but haven’t checked the web-app yet, go take a look. Your past self has been putting in work.

1pqbm8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1pqbm8z/the_lost_high_season/,The lost high season,"Hi, I’ve seen a lot of strange takes lately about whether tourism in Thailand is actually “down” this year, and being a coffeeshop/bar owner here I wanted to share my perspective that doesn’t rely on simple airport numbers or rage bait videos, but on what my and other businesses daily foot traffic is.

If you’re only sticking to the most popular areas, the main pedestrian streets, beachfront areas, night markets, and the roads everyone already knows, it can *feel* like nothing has changed. These spots are still busy. They’re loud, crowded at peak hours, and looks packed enough that a quick walk-through gives you the impression that tourism is healthy and stable. From that point of view, it’s easy to say, “Everything looks fine.”

The real difference shows up when you move one layer off the main arteries. Secondary shops, the cafés, bars, massage shops, and restaurants that are not *on* the main walking road but just around the corner or halfway down a side street (my place fits this description), are feeling a noticeable downturn. These places used to rely on overflow foot traffic: people wandering, exploring, going into something interesting they hadn’t planned on. That casual discovery traffic is down significantly, if not entirely in many instances.

The businesses are still open, lights are on, staff is there, but the everything feels off. Fewer impulse customers, and long quiet stretches throughout the day. The revenue that used to come in steadily throughout the day now arrives in short, inconsistent bursts. Many of these businesses aren’t empty, but they’re operating well below what would normally be considered sustainable during what should be a strong period.

Then there’s the tertiary shops, the newer businesses, niche concepts, or places located slightly farther from the obvious paths. In previous years, even these places would see enough curious foot traffic to survive while building a reputation. This year, many of them are seeing almost none.

Extremely low walk-ins. Hours where no customers enter at all. Some days where staff outnumber guests. You can walk entire side streets that look open, maintained, and ready for business, yet when you talk to the workers and owners there, this 👆 is their story. This is only the view from a major city, I can’t even imagine if you’re in a smaller city.

(I have a friend visiting a smaller tourist town, I will update with what he observes)

What makes this whole thing confusing is that all three of these exist at the same time. The main roads look busy, so the we hear that “tourism is normal.” But that traffic is concentrated, not flowing out to the other businesses in the way it used to. People are going to fewer places, sticking to same places they or their friends went before, and spending their time more deliberately instead of wandering.

  
This just my two cents on the situation, and I hope I can entice you to maybe go out of your way to walk into an empty bar or coffee shop for a drink, everything helps.",7,1766117545.0,ThailandTourism,6,1.0,False

Little bit of a background: I am 28 yrs old, am from the middle east, I am tall n toned, good physique, solid personality 😃(I am consistent, polite, funny, can be even a bit shy sometimes), moved to Canada 5 yrs ago and finally secured myself a PR.

Given my observations that I list below, I hope u guys can give me more insight on if I should move to Toronto or Montreal to fulfill my life goal of having a partner/family.

I am really frustrated with the social scene and the dating experience here and would love to share with you my experience as a gay middle eastern in Vancouver:

1. Beauty standards are very much white n asian centric, and I am oftentimes not seen as attractive whereas during my last visits to montreal and Toronto I noticed a much bigger and better integrated middle eastern presence in the gay villages of both cities while in Vancouver I see none!!!

2. Vancouver is very transient and 7 out of every 10 ppl I got to know in the last 5 yrs left the city already and the other 3 r strongly considering it,

3. The city and the demographics of it suck big time to the extent that I dated a guy once and I realized after my 2nd date that I have dated his bf last month, so a very small pool of ppl,

4. I know this is a universal issue across the country but affordability is also a major issue here where ppl are always running around to afford life n that leaves them with no time to date or socialize which is evident in the flakiness of the people here and them being very socially awkward all the time,

5. While I had many crushes on Asian guys and I am not a person with racial preferences, I don’t find the mainstream of the asians/whites attractive (mainly bc I am 6’1 and height is an important factor for me lol) and the city is packed with twinks of both races,

Now have any of you on this sub moved with the same issues or experiences and has life changed for the better for you?

Sometimes I feel that it is the same everywhere else as the gay dating culture is crap n I shouldn’t blame the city but I had a coffee chat with a professional at Workday and she brought up to me that “ if you are single and want to build a life, the social scene here sucks and u will be better off in Toronto or Montreal.” and ever since I am strongly debating.",1,1766117394.0,GayMenToronto,3,0.67,False

Quick reminder from your friendly mod: the NFC chip on your Nopa Move isn’t just there for vibes.

Every time you tap your bottle at a partner café, you’re not only unlocking rewards — you’re also **logging a real reuse**. One tap = one moment where a single-use cup didn’t happen. And now, with the new web-app, those taps don’t disappear into the void anymore.

You can actually **see your reuse count grow**.

Not estimated. Not “good intentions.” Actual numbers, tied to *your* bottle.

We’ve seen people get weirdly competitive with themselves (in a good way). “Just one more coffee to hit 50 reuses” energy is very real here.

If you haven’t tapped in a while, this is your sign ☕

Reuse counts don’t track themselves.

I know I don’t have much time. My Sister is a cunt. She fucked my last boyfriend when he got super high at my birthday party. Tanner and I broke up the next day. He felt so horrible and I had never seen a boy cry before. But Tanner said he couldn’t forgive himself and that he needed to get the fuck away from me and my whole family. 

I mean he was still nice to me and all that September at school or whatever but Tanner definitely blocked me everywhere else online. My Friends did say that whenever people did come up and ask what happened between us Tanner was at least decent enough to admit that it was all his fault. 

But my Sister was sober. She knew exactly what she was doing that night. She was home from 
college and she had recently broken up with some guy and she decided to steal Tanner to make herself feel better. I’m in fucking high school! OK so I get drunk and pass out! Does that mean my feelings don’t count? Yeah I was drinking under age! So what? She did that shit too all the time when she was 17! Nobody ever did anything like this to her! I certainly didn’t! It was just so unfair! I had to get revenge! I knew it was the only way to get my Sister to realize that she would never get away with doing that kinda shit to me ever again! 

I just never knew what would happen after. I never knew what the price of revenge would be. 
It was like 4 months after my birthday and my sister and I were both off for winter break. We 
didn’t speak much but we had to see each other every day. It was awkward and Mom would 
walk around and try to pretend like nothing was happening. 

That’s when I figured it out. When I saw my sister coming home late one night. I saw her making out with her new boy toy on our front porch. And I knew right then: I’m gonna fuck his brains out. 
Thank God he was hotter than her last fuck boy. This new guy Jordie was tall muscular and black. I had never fucked a black guy and I was more than a little nervous about it. But I figured if my bitch of a Sister can do it then so can I! I also kinda low-key like the idea of pissing off my Step-Dad too. I mean I wasn’t gonna flat out 
tell him or anything. But my Step-Dad’s super racist and if he ever did find out it would be hilarious hearing him whine about it.

I stalked Jordie online for weeks. I never actually DM’d him or anything like that but I totally scoped him out. Jordie got around. He was in school for music but I think he really just wanted to smoke weed. All of his pics were of turn-tables and bongs. But he was also used to dating a lot of different girls. Every other pic he was kissing or holding on to some thirst trap e-thot! White or Black or Asian. All different kinds. And then suddenly there was my Big Sister twerking on 
him at some club while posing for a selfie. 

She was so proud of herself. Bragging all about her new hot black boyfriend on all of her reels. It 
was so cringe. Like she was basically saying look everyone! I’m so not racist! I take big black 
dick now! I was half tempted to just share the pics with my Step-Dad and be done with it. But that wouldn’t really do anything. All that would do is make everything worse. Then she could just go online crying for clout. Speaking on how strong and brave she was. About how she was fighting to crush the straight white male patriarchy. And besides she wouldn’t really care. No way she’d 
actually care if our racist Step-Dad tried to break her and Jordie up. Her crying would all just be 
performative. She’d just go on hinge or bumble or whatever and get a new fuck boy. Black or 
not. 

If I really wanted to get my Sister back I needed to make her jealous. I needed to show her I was just as hot as she was. She thought she could have whoever she wanted? Well so could I! 

I remember the first time because I was so nervous. But I didn’t let Jordie know. I had made sure he knew I was interested the days leading up to it. Not just hints. Guys don’t get hints. I knew I 
couldn’t just stare at him for too long before I left the room with come fuck me eyes. I knew I 
had to be way more obvious. So I flashed him a bunch of times when no one else was looking. 
He knew then. 

December 12th
 
Jordie came over to drop off my Sister’s Christmas present. I told him I’d help him wrap it if he came over after school. He said no at first. But then I told him I’d be home alone. He was there soon after I Snapchatted him. I opened the door and he was all over me. It really turned me on how bad Jordie wanted me. He was hot. He was rough. He was huge. But he was quick. Like it was all over in less than a couple of minutes. I couldn’t really tell how I felt about it. But I also 
remember thinking that this was only the first time. I knew the real goal was to get caught. 

December 15th
 
I got Jordie the second time after he came over to hang out with my Sister. They got high. She 
passed out. And Jordie fucked me on the couch right next to her. But my Sister never woke up. 
Then Jordie ghosted me. No texts. No Snapchat. Nothing. And my Sister was always over at his 
place after that. I can remember thinking I had missed my chance to get revenge. 

December 21st
 
Jordie came over and Mom went to bed early and my Sister got drunk. Jordie came out of the bathroom when I cornered him. What he didn’t know was I had his cellphone. While he was taking off my clothes I called my Sister’s cell. It took her a little while but eventually she walked
in on us. She opened the door and screamed. She was so angry. I ran and hid behind the shower curtain. My Sister yelled and hit Jordie and pushed him into the hallway. He grabbed his phone and pulled up his pants and bolted. 
It was perfect. 

My Sister was crying. That’s when I laughed. She turned and she saw me smirking. She went full on psycho bitch after that! She tried to push me around too but then Mom came in and separated us. Mom was so fucking pissed at us. Saying how we had ruined Christmas. We were ruining everything she said. Said how ugly we were treating each other this way. I know it might sound fake or whatever but I actually felt real bad for getting poor Mom involved. It wasn’t supposed to get to her. Mom had been through enough already and the last thing I wanted to do was ruin her Christmas. But there we were. And to be dead ass honest it had been worth it to see my Big Sister cry. But I have to admit it. Things were different after that night. 

Decemeber 22nd
 
The next day I had never seen Mom so quiet. She wouldn’t even look at us. Our Step-Dad knew 
something was up too but Mom didn’t tell him what happened. He was still shitty with us. He 
knew we had done something. My Sister was different after that night too. She spoke all soft andwould just look at the floor a lot. She didn’t try to argue with me or be a bitch or anything. It was like my Sister had given up. 

I tried to call Jordie but he ignored me. 
That night I couldn’t sleep. The house was too quiet. And that’s when I heard the ringing. 
I can remember sitting up in bed thinking an alarm or something was going off. 

December 23rd
 
I hadn’t slept all night. The ringing had kept me up. Then my phone chirped and I looked at the 
screen. My battery was almost completely dead but I saw that I had just gotten a text from my 
girl Kia. I clicked on it and was shocked. Kia told me that Jordie was bragging on Twitch about 
fucking both me and my Sister! She said Jordie used our names too! Said he called us the Hoe 
Sisters. Snow Bunnies Jordie had said. I tried to call Jordie again but my phone died. I plugged it 
in to charge and went downstairs. 

I needed like a break or something. I remember thinking that maybe some coffee would help. As
soon as I went into the kitchen Mom walked out. I called out after her but Mom just ignored me. I said I was sorry but she never even looked at me. That’s when I noticed that the ringing was back. I went into my room. I tried to go back to sleep. I dozed on and off all day and into the night. Sometimes I could sleep. Sometimes the ringing would keep me up. 

December 24th
 
I had slept all day and woke up at night. I grabbed my cellphone to check the time but for some reason it never charged. My phone was like a worthless plastic brick. I tried to check my laptop but it wouldn’t turn on. Just a constant loading circle. But I did see the date on the bottom of the screen. It was Christmas Eve.

I can remember calling out to Mom but if she did say anything back I couldn’t hear her. All I could hear was that constant ringing. Almost like little bells chiming but muffled with like an echo or something. I went downstairs. The ringing was even louder now. But the house was empty. Only the colored lights of the Christmas Tree lit up the dark living room. I saw something on the floor in front of the tree. I didn’t know what it was so I got closer. I can remember kneeling down to pick it up. 4 brass sleigh bells covered in like a brown kinda slime. I can also remember hoping that the little bells were covered in mud and not shit. 

I threw the little decorations away and washed my hands in the kitchen sink. I can remember 
turning off the water and being shocked at how much louder the ringing sound had gotten. I
turned and saw my Sister standing in the kitchen doorway. At first I was going to just ignore her 
but then she turned her head. 

Her eyes were rolled back and she was choking. She fell to her knees and reached out to me and 
like kinda pointed at her throat. I rushed over and that’s when her mouth opened and blood poured out. But it wasn’t just blood. Something hard hit the floor too. It took me a second to realize what I was seeing. More brass sleigh bells! She was throwing them up more and more all over the kitchen floor in front of her. I backed away. I can remember thinking to myself how is this even possible? 

That’s when I backed up into something. I jumped and saw Mom and my Step-Dad crawling on the kitchen floor behind me. Mom looked up at me and puked out more of the same blood and little sleigh bells that my Sister had. My Step-Dad just fell flat on his face and into the puddle below him. He wasn’t moving anymore. I was screaming but all I could hear was the ringing. Louder and louder. 

Next thing I knew Mom and my Sister were pulling at my clothes. Then at my arms. Then at my hair. They were both dragging me down to the floor. My Sister held my mouth open and Mom 
vomited blood and those little fucking bells all over my face. Then everything went dark and wet and I couldn’t see or breathe.

I don’t know how I broke free but when I opened my eyes again the ringing had stopped. I looked down and saw my hands were wrapped around the necks of both Mom and my Sister. They were dead. I released my grip and they fell to the floor. They’re slacked mouths still leaking blood. They’re opened eyes staring up at me blankly. 
Tears filled my own and that’s when I started to choke. My vision blurred. I couldn’t breathe again. The pain was indescribable. Like my throat and face were splitting open. And just when I thought I was going to pass out my vision suddenly came back and I was lying face down on top of my dead Sister and Mom.

When I lifted my head I saw something big and wet curled up on the floor in front of me. Then 
The Thing moved. There was that jingling sound again but now the ringing was clearer than before. I can remember trying to scream but the sound wouldn’t come. Or at least I couldn’t hear 
it if I was screaming. And that’s when I realized that the constant ringing had come back. Then
The Thing stood up.

It was like a huge bloody skeleton but it was alive and its long arms were wrapped in thin metal chains. And hanging from each little link were more of those little brass sleigh bells. The Thing turned its bald head and I knew that it could see me. And just when The Thing started to turn around completely I got to my feet and ran. 

I ran outside into the cold. It was dark and I couldn’t see where I was going but I kept running. I didn’t stop. My bare feet were numb but I didn’t care. I ran and I ran until the ringing finally stopped. Then I slowed down. My feet were bleeding but I couldn’t feel any pain. Not anymore. All I could really feel was the cold air when I was trying to catch my breath. 

December 25th
 
Christmas morning I knocked on Kia’s front door. I remember thinking her Parents might not let 
me in because I was covered in blood. But it was dry so I didn’t know for sure either way. Kia’s
Parents hadn’t woken up yet so she actually opened the door for me. 

Kia let me in and she called the Police. Her Parents were up after that. They listened to my story while we all waited in the kitchen for the Cops to show up. I knew that no one would believe me. It was no real surprise to me when her Parents got up from the table to talk. That’s when I asked Kia to lend me her laptop. I figured I should post about this as soon as possible. God only knows the next time I’ll even be allowed online. 

I know it doesn’t really matter now but I just needed to say I’m sorry. To everyone. I know it 
sounds dumb or whatever but it’s the truth. I’m sorry and I

I desperately want to leave but I'm afraid of being seen as non-compliant or ""irrational"". My doctor also did so much to convince me to get here. My therapist was supportive as well.

The intensity of the protocol is unlike anything I've experienced. The meal plan is aggressive.  After three days, the meal plan was up to >!2800!< calories and I'm 5'4""/fairly short. I've never had to eat this much in such a short time in any treatment program. Especially because I'm basically on bed rest except for two five minute walks a day, and a five minute shower max. I am watched 24/7  by some AI video/person hybrid monitor that yells at me when I am moving too much.

I've been here over a week. My vitals have stabilized. My labs are now normal. I did experience the beginnings of refeeding syndrome but they corrected it with supplementation. They want my weight to be higher before I discharge but it is no longer really that low. This is overkill for someone not that sick...

I get zero choice in the food. Every meal and snack is a complete surprise. No coffee or tea. There is no real conversation with the dietitian, no psychiatry, no therapy. Just eating and staring out a window with not a sign of life.  

I'm on a feeding tube and it truly feels traumatic. I don't want to be compliant and feel so powerless at the same time. I started self-harming yesterday, and I very rarely do that anymore. It feels traumatic to gain weight so rapidly, to force myself to eat so much this rapidly compared to intake before. To feel so full with raging reflux.

Please, any honest feedback would be helpful. I need to get out of here but would be signing out AMA. I want to have a healthier relationship with food, even if I'm not pursuing full recovery. But this isn't it. I am blindly eating, racing a clock at timed meals. 

I feel like I can't have an opinion because medical professionals are always seen as right. But this feels traumatic. 

And I ended up here because my insurance will not cover inpatient eating disorder center, but they will pay for a medical stay if I got ""sick enough"" which is how I ended up here. They'll cover residential but I was not medically stable/weight was too low so I had limited options. Not that it would've been life changing but that's another story. 

I have to return to work soon  and I can't decide what is better for me...to stay or to leave and try to maintain some of the progress outpatient. But I also am already thinking about losing it all when I go out. I'm thinking about leaving, binging/purging and collapsing on the couch so maybe I'm delusional. There is no winning. 

I trust the doctor here, who is kind and compassionate.

I went in to tyre power purchased two kumo tyres and wanted both of them fitted on the left side. The front was completely flat but the back was still roadworthy. So I wanted to keep the back left as a spare.

The other tyres (Dunlop) on the right side were in excellent condition. No need to change them. 

When they finished fitting my tyres I checked the left ones and they had only fitted one tyre my front that was completely flat. They said that the other kumo tyre was in the back and that they had only fitted the worst one. I said ok.

I went to a different tyrepower (Jandakot) to get the spare fitted. They looked in the back it wasn’t there.

1pqbfgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1pqbfgj/real_estate_players_wheel_and_deal_for_palo_alto/,Real estate players wheel and deal for Palo Alto office building,"The recent acquisition of a prominent office building in Palo Alto marks a significant transaction within the Bay Area's real estate landscape, signaling ongoing confidence in the region's commercial property market, particularly in the tech and biotech sectors. This deal highlights a few key trends and implications for residents, investors, and the local market at large.

Firstly, Palo Alto continues to be a beacon for tech and biotech companies, bolstered by its positioning within the heart of Silicon Valley. The buyer's identity as a high-profile real estate player underscores a strategic move to capitalize on the area's established reputation as a hub for innovation and talent. As remote work becomes more commonplace, especially after the pandemic, it may seem counterintuitive for large firms to invest heavily in office spaces. However, this transaction suggests a long-term vision, where physical spaces are seen not just as workplaces but as innovation hubs that foster collaboration and creativity. Companies are recognizing the value of in-person interactions, particularly in sectors that thrive on brainstorming and spontaneous idea generation.

For local residents, this transaction has implications beyond the immediate business context. The influx of investment into commercial real estate can lead to increased economic activity, potentially creating new job opportunities both in construction and subsequent leasing and operational roles within those buildings. However, this growth often comes with challenges, such as rising housing demand and subsequent housing costs. While an expanding tech sector can drive up demand for residential properties, it can also exacerbate the existing housing crisis in the Bay Area, further straining the already limited supply. Residents may need to brace for continuing discussions on housing policy and development initiatives to balance growth with affordability.

From an investor's perspective, this deal reinforces the notion that Silicon Valley remains a solid investment despite recent market fluctuations influenced by economic conditions and interest rate hikes. Real estate investors are likely to view this acquisition as an endorsement of the area's long-term viability, particularly in niche markets such as biotech, which has shown resilience and growth during uncertain times. Moreover, the potential for rental income in a thriving area like Palo Alto remains attractive, especially with companies seeking quality office space that fosters a conducive work environment.

As we observe the broader trends in the Bay Area, the demand for office space in established tech corridors is likely to remain robust, even as firms adapt their real estate strategies in the wake of evolving work dynamics. Companies may choose to pursue flexible leasing arrangements or seek spaces that offer amenities that cater to a new era of hybrid work. The influx of capital into such properties could also lead to increased investments in infrastructure and services that enhance the overall appeal of the region, benefiting all stakeholders involved.

Moreover, the economic ripple effects of such transactions often extend into surrounding neighborhoods, impacting local businesses, retail, and services. The influx of office workers can drive demand for coffee shops, restaurants, and other service-oriented businesses, thereby rejuvenating local economies. However, this growth must be managed carefully to avoid displacing existing businesses and residents, underscoring the importance of community engagement in urban planning discussions.

In conclusion, the acquisition of this Palo Alto office building is more than just a real estate transaction; it serves as an indicator of the resilience and adaptability of the Silicon Valley economy. As business leaders and investors position themselves for the future, the interplay between commercial real estate dynamics, economic development, and community impact will be crucial for ensuring that growth benefits the entire region. For residents and stakeholders, staying informed and engaged in these developments will be essential as the Bay Area continues to navigate its complex landscape of opportunity and challenge.

Yesterday after I finished a cup of coffee, my stomach started hurting really bad so I went to the bathroom, and my poop was super dark, sticky, and had a yellow bile to it. It hurt for an hour or two but then it went away. I still needed to use the bathroom occasionally, but it wasn’t excruciating. 

Today I’ve been feeling fine, but every time I use the bathroom it’s still a bit of super dark and sticky nuggets. I’m getting a bit concerned because all the information I’m seeing says it’s a GI bleed, but I’d love some input from others that have had the same issue and what you did about it. I’ve eaten a larger quantity of dark chocolate, pomegranates, high fiber foods, etc recently if that helps contribute to it.

I would wake up after what should have been enough sleep, but still feel exhausted. Before I even got out of bed, I was already scrolling. Reddit, TikTok, emails, headlines. By the time I stood up, my mind already felt cluttered and overstimulated.

I didn’t question it much at first. It felt normal. Everyone does it, right? But over time I noticed I was starting the day tense and unfocused. My mood felt off early, my concentration was terrible, and by mid afternoon I would hit a wall almost every day.

I didn’t have the motivation to completely change my lifestyle, so I decided to experiment with a few small things instead. I started going for short walks in the evenings. I made a rule to drink water before coffee. I added a couple of light mobility training during the week, nothing intense.

The biggest change though was this: no phone in the morning until I got outside and saw real daylight.

At first it felt almost silly. Standing outside for a few minutes, looking at the sky, not doing anything else. But after a few days, I noticed a real difference. My mornings felt quieter. I woke up more naturally. I felt less anxious and more grounded. Even my sleep improved, which surprised me.

I wasn’t consistent every single day. Some mornings were rushed, some were cloudy, and sometimes I slipped back into old habits. But overall, that one change made my mornings feel intentional instead of reactive, and that carried through the rest of the day.

A few resources that helped me along the way:

* Atomic Habits by James Clear [https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834](https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834) This helped me stop thinking I needed to fix everything at once. Small changes really do add up.
* The Huberman Lab Podcast [https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) The episodes on light, dopamine, and circadian rhythms made the science behind this finally click for me.
* Bright Start [https://www.brightstart.app](https://www.brightstart.app) I found this through Reddit. It locks certain apps in the morning until you scan real sunlight. It helped remove the constant willpower battle for me.

If you’ve been feeling foggy, burnt out, or disconnected, try not to be too hard on yourself. You’re not broken. Sometimes your nervous system just needs a calmer start to the day. Start small. Step outside. Let the light hit your eyes. It matters more than it seems.",2,1766116825.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

I’m relatively new to Mumbai and haven’t really explored the dating or social scene here, especially when it comes to mature women, so I thought I’d put this out honestly.

In Pune, I had a thing with a couple of women in their early to mid 40s and damn, that energy stays with you. Not just dates, but real chemistry. Coffee that turned into long conversations, slow burns, heavy eye contact & then intense, confident sex with zero awkwardness. They knew their bodies, knew what they wanted, and weren’t shy about taking control or letting go.

Personal opinion: sex with a mature woman is different. Slower, deeper, hotter. Long make out sessions, teasing that drives you crazy, and a pleasure-first mindset that younger scenes just don’t hit the same way. Once you’ve experienced that, it’s hard to unfeel it.

Not assuming anything or being disrespectful just curious and trying to understand the ground reality before I explore further.

1pqb8pn,https://i.redd.it/helj5o0u238g1.jpeg,"Review: JD10, Knob Creek 12, Russell’s Private Pick, Old Charter Finest Oak","
Jack Daniel’s 10 year (Batch 2)

N:  Immediate nosing is bitter dark chocolate oak, but quickly shifts to maple syrup. If I keep smelling, all I get is maple syrup. Very inviting (best nose by far) 

P: First taste- minimal spice and ethanol heat…First taste is like a mix of dark coco powder with coffee…take that concept and mix it with an almost burnt crème brûlée, with a banana peel for scent on the side (lol)

F: Smokey Oak and salted caramel. The whole time this thing rides the line but never reaches over-charred, or overly bitter


Knob Creek 12 year

N: leather, tobacco, dark fruits, minerality, peanut sauce

P: Complex; minor spice/ethanol heat up front, salted caramel, mild butterscotch

F: Moderate finish here, especially given the abv. Baking spices come on the backend; cinnamon, clove, subtle juicy mint, tannins come in but not too heavy


Russels single barrel store pick (Batch pick; Warehouse B Floor 4)

N: Oak, red wine, raspberry syrup, maple 

P: Hits with heavy baking spices right off the bat. Dark Raspberry

F: Dark fruits, barrel char, drying, then some rye flavors come through on the finish but not spicy rye, more like that smooth, minty white pepper rye flavor


Old Charter: Finest Oak (2025)

N: Cherry cordial, Bright vanilla candy, melon, fruits, slightly dusty, subtle oak, sandalwood (2nd best nose)

P: Almost no spice/ethanol heat. Rainier cherry, Strawberry, vanilla, faint butterscotch

F: Not much of a shift from the palate, somewhat short, subtle oak (although side by side with buffalo trace, the oak and age hits here and makes the Buffalo Trace taste too sweet)




Final thoughts:
This is a tough one. All of these are great pours. On immediate sniff…The Old Charter stands out because of how sweet and floral it smells. The other 3 have varying degrees of this sweet cigar-like oaky scent right off the bat. The most balanced of the “sweet cigar-like oaky scents” is the Russell’s, with the Jack Daniel’s 10 next (but also the sweetest of the oaky ones) and Knob Creek 12 last, as far as bruising oak, scent-wise. Palate-wise, JD 10 is the most decadent and well integrated with oak. Knob Creek 12 is the most complex and wide-ranging flavor-wise, with the greatest concentrations of caramel, vanilla, and oak, the Russell’s exhibits the best balance between sweet and bitter, those dark fruits and oak, and the Old Charter is the “smoothest”, sweetest, and fruitiest. I don’t really know how to rank these because they’re all fantastic. When tasted next to the other 3, Old Charter’s sweetness tastes almost artificial. But it’s at the edge. I’m here for it. But I’m also here for these rich oak flavors goin on. I think I’m just going to have to give each of these an 8. Truthfully, I cannot pick one. It’s been 2 hours now, and I’ve waffled between the Old Charter as this summery sweet pour, the Russell’s as the best of both worlds but master of none, the knob creek as really riding the edge of sweet and bitter, and the JD as the decadent maple syrupy oak pour.

Last Thursday, I went to big chain store to get my tires changed, and while I was there, I noticed a girl who immediately caught my attention, humble, confident, and beautiful. After my own car was done, I drove past a nearby coffee shop and saw her again. I panicked, didn’t know what to do, but eventually went in and bought a drink just to be in the same space.

After a few minutes, I worked up the courage to go say hi. I told her I saw her at shop and couldn’t stop thinking about telling her she looked beautiful. I admitted I was nervous, which was true, and we started talking about her studies and life. She’s a med student, aiming for xxxx, and was super kind and receptive.

We exchanged numbers after a short, positive conversation. Later that night, I texted her something like:

“It was really nice meeting you today. I was so nervous my mind went blank and my heart was racing, haha. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. I hope your tire change went smoothly and that you had a good day. I really enjoyed talking with you and getting to know a bit about you. Hopefully next time we can have a proper introduction. Good night and take care!”

She replied after half an hour, saying she was nervous too (first time for her) and that it wasn’t awkward at all. We exchanged a few texts back and forth, and a couple texts the next day, the last exchange was - she texted me saying good day and I didn’t come across as nervous, thought this guy (me) is so social 😄 and have a great weekend, so I mirrored her energy, also said, I am definitely not the social type, yesterday was a bit out of my character, and wished her good weekend, then silence. both of us hearting each other’s OTHER messages, and not my last one, and I tried to keep things light, friendly, and playful.

Here’s where I’m stuck: i texted her again today, literally a week after when we met, I said

Hey Xxxxx🙂

Hope your week’s been going well.

How’s school treating you, still surviving deadlines, or does it call for another tire appointment or a coffee shop(I mentioned the brand of the coffee shop like a insider joke) break? 😄

it’s now been a FEW hours, and after my last text, she hasn’t responded. I guess this is not going anywhere..

I don’t want to come off as needy, but I also feel like I made a positive impression in person and through texts. Did I handle it well? Am I overthinking this? How likely is it that she’s still interested or that she’ll ever text me first?

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

ELIMINATE OR KEEP CARDS.,"   So I’m currently an owner of 4 cards (Discover It, Savor, Amex Blue cash preferred, and the Amex Gold) and I’m looking to maximize my cash back and points from spending. My number one spending category is food. I use my savor for small items at the deli or any take out foods, (Pizza, Chinese, Sandwiches, and Coffee) which I do everyday . I use my Amex Gold for when I go out to bigger dinners with friends or family (Ramen, Sushi, Hibachi etc) which is usually 4-6x a month. 

My second biggest category is Grocery’s and Gas, which I use the Amex Blue cash preferred. (I buy groceries every 3 days and do big hauls every weekend, as for gas I fill up once every week)

My Discover card doesn’t have an exact purpose It was my first line of credit, so now it’s just used for whatever the rotating Category is, and I have 2 gym memberships on it. 

My first question is, whether I should cancel my Savor card and use my Gold card for all food items. The only reason I haven’t done so is because I want to get the Venture X, (I travel 2x a year both internationally, one for family and the other for vacation) and I want to have a cash back card to back it up. After all the Savor card is Free. As for Amex, does anyone know if the Blue cash preferred is worth keeping? I mainly have it for the 6% on grocery’s while still giving me 3% on gas. While the Gold is 4x on Grocery’s and just 1x on gas. I don’t plan on getting the Plat, but I definitely want to know if I should keep or close any of my 2 Amex cards. Besides the Venture X the only other card I want to get is the Sapphire Preferred only because I want to use points on Hyatt, and I currently bank with Chase. I just don’t know what I’ll use the preferred for. (Maybe just my 2 streaming services). It also wouldn’t really make sense because I don’t even have a cash back card like the freedom unlimited or the flex. 

Main Questions: Is my current set up good? Would the 2 cards I want make sense? What would you change/add?

1pqak96,https://i.redd.it/jblny58qw28g1.jpeg,An account of the Monsignor Massacres,"It was on the cusp of last winter’s heaviest snow that the rumours of strange visitors began filtering through campus. Being an academic institute removed from the urban sprawl two buses or a moderate car ride away, countless trails and walkways had been carved into the nature reserve backing the facilities down to the water’s edge. The administration had paved and lit several pathways, posted maps, erected information boards, and marked off trails as the adversarial weather or the need for maintenance became more dire. That said, campus authorities did little to curb the influx of students, professors, and staff who needed a common place away from the prying surveillance boasting safety in hindsight.

The first gossip I caught wind of was talk of worryingly tall and lank figures loping down trails whenever people would approach with careless distraction, the beasts, freshman, or stranger disappearing around trees and suggestively obscuring bushes without a trace. There were reports of irregularly proportioned animals standing adjacent to beaten paths without regard to their proximity to folk who tried to approach them. No one succeeded in touching any wildlife—though no doubt many attempts were made by the inebriated or otherwise intoxicated strollers, saunterers, or walkers out for evening or nighttime jaunts—but an unsettling number of reports were dismissed, each claiming that these odd beasts echoed words spoken to them with uncanny, accurate mimicry.

None of these occurrences were ever caught on film, either by institution security or by any of the reporting persons: administration ignored all occurrences, deeming them pranks or unsubstantiated and unreliable narratives. Those administrators fell at once under suspicion with the discovery of the first body. 

Jonathan Flat, the student who found the lacerated pieces of the Maria Whitburg, was immediately thought to be the killer, so fresh was the blood he slipped on and tumbled through as he ran ahead of his gaggle of merry friends. Flat had trod upon a small litter of flayed skin bearing all the tattoos of the deceased; police later reluctantly released Flat despite having no other solid leads on who might dismember the young woman and arrange the mangled sections of her body in geometric concentrations bridged my patterns of blood drawn along the snow-layered earth. Beside her torso that showed evidence of animal mauling at centre, her legs, arms, and severed hands, made for lurid focal points around the unicursal hexagram in which she had been arranged: her head was never found, and it was only by a shoplifting arrest a decade prior that identification of the third-year student could be made. Police swarmed our campus and a manhunt was immediately engaged, though it would fruitlessly escalate in the coming weeks.

The second ritual murder tied to the grisly affair was thought to be a separate incident entirely, so arrogant or uncaring were the city officials when bothering to investigate the brutal slaying of an elderly vagrant man who had made his winter camp under the overpass bordering one corner of the same nature reserve. Unfortunately, too little is known of the deceased and headless man beyond what of his remains were observed; that he was cut and carved with over seventy geometrical incisions prehumously—though none self-inflicted—while under no restraint, alcohol, drug, or any outside influence. 

While the death of a tramp did little to stoke the already burning fires of sensationalism rocking the academic neighbourhood, several live witness reports claiming to see a tall man dressed in a long patchwork coat of garish patterns and mismatched furs openly murdering a child on the lake’s partially frozen surface under the high noonday sun were taken more seriously. Dispatched officers arrived to find the nine-year old Bobby Warren drowned in the icy waters and laid at the centre of a broad circular design marked with unknown glyphs and broken triangles. The daylight slaughter of a child whose abduction and absence had not even been reported erupted news media into a full-throated frenzy. Coroners stated that while the cause of death was consistent with drowning, it could not be said how the child had survived her larynx being ripped out, collarbone shattered, and heart removed all apparently through her mouth prior to her head being plunged into the lake; no other incisions, cuts, or injuries could be found on Warren’s small, underdressed body.

Like so many of my peers busying ourselves with the season-end testing, I paid little attention to the horrific news despite its proximity to my work and home. Only when I could push my own studies and the endless marking and writing that is an academic’s life aside was I able to give the matter any real attention. My housemate Linz had been a devotee of true crime and had been employed by several papers around the city and relished a fresh perspective to the carnage, such was their fevered article assignments.

“We haven’t had anything like this in the city since—well nothing exactly like this,” Linz said. ”A few serial killers over the years but nothing major since the campus expansions and generous community funding four decades back.” Linz was a tenacious hound of a reporter buried under a pyramid of barely-contained curly hair and and a moist layer of over-producted skin. They breathed through anxiety-flattened teeth from their position at the table’s far end that had been commandeered as a workspace soon after moving in. “If we thought the campus was crawling with postering badges now, the neighbourhood parent groups are going to covering every bare surface with flyers and sanctimonious fundraising. D’you remember the fire two years ago? Getting lunch is gonna be a nightmare.”

“I can’t really blame them,” I mused as I settled into my third cup of coffee since crawling out of bed barely an hour earlier. This’ll be what everyone’s talking about for years, unless there’s a school shooting or a drug bust big enough to prop up an election or marketing campaign.”

Linz did not look up from the array of glowing screens and piles of notepads and printouts mounded around them. “The last time we had one of those was ‘87, and there isn’t enough money coming out of the steel plants to move sizeable drugs through our meagre port.”

I sighed and stared into the over-boiled swill I was forcing down. “All I want for Christmas is uninteresting times.”

“Bad luck, I’m afraid. Santa only comes for the grads who sacrifice the raccoons plaguing the dining halls.”

I could feel my eyebrow arch. “Is that your new angle? Desperate student satanic ritual? Seems pretty low brow, even for you.”

“Of course not,” Linz snapped along with a glare. “Editorial’s given out strict instructions not to use the “S” word. No money in relighting that particular bonfire for some reason no one will say.”

“That’s weird right there. When did tabloids ever refuse a low hanging fruit? No chance your rags have pulled their standards up out of the muck away from amusing us common peasant masses?” Their reply was a silent hand gesture. I shrugged and stood to busy myself with a breakfast more substantial than fluids. “Shame. Well I hope something breaks for you soon.”

I did not yet know that as I was offering my pronouncement that Monday morning, a family of three was being pieced back together in a plain two-storey less than a dozen blocks away. Harmonious neighbours to those living around them, Samuel, Lidia, and their daughter Paula Vargas were found seated at their prim dining room table, held fixed in position by meticulously pinned and tied fishing line spider webbing the room. Each of the Vargas family had their hands severed and suspended above their place settings cupped together as if in offering. Their feet had been lopped off and placed near the front door like misshapen pairs of boots. Mass exsanguination had occurred, pooling under the table and penetrating to the basement apartment rented by one Stephen Correa, who called in the wellness check that had summoned police. Decapitation of the Vargas family had occured posthumously, and three sets of eyeballs were aligned within yet another blood-drawn geometric design filling the tabletop; none of the three heads were recovered.

For the first and only time, the killer had left direct correspondence, which was almost immediately leaked despite the fury of the police commissioner. Written on the napkin set for a fourth and absent diner in an elegant if antiquated and ligature-heavy italicized script, was a note that simply read:

“Apologies for the mess. Jêhana draws closer, and the steps must be placed if the path is to be traversed. I appreciate your belated diligence. Msgr.”

To say that the press had a field day would be under selling what followed: the police department was all but crucified. People from all walks of life—children and infant always catching the most attention— had been brutally and ritualistically slaughtered, at least one in broad daylight, and the police were no closer to catching the perpetrator. As for the note, Monsignor (abbreviated to msgr) became the talk of the town. The city’s first prolific serial killer had a nom de plume, a flair for the grotesque and dramatic, and was politely thanking the police for their shoddy work.

For their part, all forensics could say was that the writing utensil used was likely a fountain pen or a feather quill. The blood fashioned as ink appeared to be a family mix, most likely from the puddle beneath the table. Handwriting analysis made a brief resurgence despite being roundly discredited by more professional reporting.

Much fuss and speculation concerning Jêhana was made. Whatever or whoever it was, there was no consent. Religious groups pronounced it as a demon, devil, some new moniker from a children’s video game, and a rising left-wing socialist movement. Secular sources claimed it to be everything from a cult, a new social media trend, an emerging hate group, or just a taunting nonsensename. All guesses were equally unlikely, with no answer in sight. Monsignor made no further announcement.

No small attention was paid to the killer’s assumed name. Calls for investigation into pastors and reverends across the city were expressed by news media and several mobs that were quickly and forcefully disbanded. Despite the season, church attendance plummeted city-wide. With the end of term at last arrived, students who might typically stay close to campus left in droves. The first heavy snowfall blanketed the nature reserve and its surrounding localities in sombre, drifting silence.

It was midway through the week when I got a strange series of texts from Linz.

“Something’s happening in the reserve. I don’t know what exactly but there’s a migration or something weirder going on.“ Attached was a video overlooking the water taken from one of the higher paved trails. Dozens of animals of all kinds were trotting out of the woods towards the waters edge, scrambling across what was frozen, and tossing themselves into the frigid wet. None of the animals seemed interested in each other, only what they were pursuing on the other shore. “Ever seen or heard of anything like this?”

“No, that’s messed up!” I replied. “What are you doing in the reserve? Are you trying to get axe murdered‽”

“I’m fine. I’m going to stick around and see how long this goes on. If you don’t hear back from me in a few hours, call someone.“

“Not funny. It’s not safe out there after dark.“

“Thanks, unwanted mother dearest. I’ll be sure to tuck myself in where it’s nice and safe and warm and enjoy a meal with my family. Oh wait.”

“Asshole. Seriously though, keep me posted.”

The next text came hours later well after nightfall. “So I worked my way around and over the bridge,” Linz wrote. “Turns out the animals have been walking out of the trees without a care in the world. Strange but not enough of a story. I’ve been following this coyote with a black stripe on its tail by a few paces, and it hasn’t looked back at me once. Then it leads me to what I can only describe as a fuck circle.

“All these animals, they keep going towards this common point. They cross some invisible line, find another of their species and they start copulating like their life depends on it. It’s a goddamn furry orgy out here. That’s messed up enough, but it’s way more unnerving that none of these critters are trying to eat each other. There’s this tangle of wolves on top of rabbits and squirrels and dogs and cats and every goddamn thing that lives in the trees just going at it. It sounds like the gates of hell, I shit you not.

“I followed the edge of the circle, or at least where I think the edge is, and I end up stepping out of the woods onto this posh suburban street. The houses here are all gated or decorated with stone lions and shit. Old money here. So I’m walking around the edge and what do I spy as the epicentre of this furry free for all is this big event hall. This place is done up all in lights, there’s cars everywhere, sparkly banners flying from the windows, it’s a whole goddamn to do. Seems like tonight is this big winter fundraising gala with all the big wigs from downtown coming to rub  elbows.

“I’m freezing after trudging through snow for the last two hours, but there’s a story here. I’m gonna warm up, grab a bite, talk to my editor, and get back out here. I bet my left ass cheek that something is going down tonight, and I’m going to be the one to break it.“

Linz was absolutely right. What would later be called the Monsignor Massacre, or the Blood Orgy Killings, was to date the worst scene of carnage in our city’s history. I won’t bother going over the fine points—enough has been written about that night—but any hope of the police quietly handling the murders and bringing them to a close evaporated amidst a sea of politician, power players, moneyed interests, officials, and high ranking bureaucrats that were all involved or evidence to be involved in a mania of horrific sex, bloody violence and high fashion debauchery. At the end of it, seventeen notable persons had been gruesomely killed, cannibalized, defiled, and been subject to unspeakable horrors, while not a single guest or support staff escaped without grievous mutilation or serious harm. I don’t know when the city’s brass is going to fill the power vacuum left by the sudden vacancy of mayor, chief of police, diocese-presiding bishop, district attorney, key lobbyists, and the heads of some very old and wealthy dynasties.

I don’t know how Linz’s managed to get inside, but their photos and videos sold like wildfire. Not only could the salacious scandal be enough to dominate the new cycle seemingly without end, my friend’s articles were the first to mention and tie in the mass animal death that occurred adjacent and surrounding the scene of so much human tragedy. Over two thousand desiccated animal corpses were recovered, all seemingly dead of malnourishment, dehydration, and exhaustion, all dead within a period of twenty-four hours leading up to the gala event.

Home was quieter than usual for a week with Linz’s understandable absence. When we next shared a meal that was to be our last, their appearance was both haggard and stricken with a possessed obsessiveness I hadn’t before seen. They were estranged from sleep, time torn between press meeting rooms, courts, a brief overnight in jail, several expensive hotels, and visiting with attorneys and threatening officials. Now a known-name reporter, they hadn’t been much downtime; fevered research had filled what few quiet moments Linz had been able to find.

While I was basking in my freedom from responsibility, their lines of questioning had become more and more convoluted as their visits to various halls of power had left them leaning more suspicious and conspiratorial than ever. “Everyone’s leaning hard on the cult idea now, but that feels too tidy. I keep coming back to the note,“ Linz mused while we ate dinner over a bottle of red wine I’d been gifted (unsuccessfully bribed by a student) for a special occasion. “I think it’s closer to a where, not a who. I know it doesn’t feel like a building could take a stroll, but something doesn’t feel right thinking about it as a person. Maybe an event or some grand ascension.” 

“Any luck with your cult digging?“ I asked, spearing an indecipherable triangle from my stir-fried bowl. The black sauce coating it was choked with scallions and sesame seeds, and I thought to myself, “Is this what it’s like to be tarred and feathered?”

“I just might have.” Linz enthusiastically nodded. “Like I said, there’s still a lot of cult talk; everyone involved is dead or supposedly in custody, but I’ve been thinking that the whole massacre might be backwards. No one cares about the animals outside of a weird detail, but it’s the damn coyote I was following that keeps getting under my skin.

“I’ve spent two nights scouring archives for strange animal phenomenon and one of the overseas libraries I’m subscribed to dug me up a scan of a norwegian journal by this guy, Olf Birkedotter—kind of a book of days, more like a diary where he kept finding weird animal sightings and became way too into them—and the thing reads like one of those end of the world preppers. Every month he finds heralds of the end times, but in the June entries, the animals around him go nuts. He’s finding carcasses, tracks without start or end, animals all mashed together into these mutated abominations. Then people start disappearing from the next town over. The priest in his town is denouncing this other place as hell-bound sinners getting what they deserved, and our guy is eating it up.

“Was there a—“ I interjected.

”Yeah, you guessed it,” Linz said with their crooked, wolf grin. “Olf found a fuck circle. He followed some sheep that broke out of their pen—broke out mind you, not escaped—followed them and found half his town’s herds going at it in this clearing in the woods he swore was never there, and he spent his life in those forests. He tells his pastor and gets waved off. Some animals being animals. Then all the livestock turn up dead, and our writer gets run out of town.”

“Oof. So much for not shooting the messenger. Poor Olf.”

Linz shrugged in between quick swallows. “They needed somewhere to put their fear; we haven’t grown much in the last seven centuries since.”

I chewed thoughtfully, mulling over their findings, as well as my own investigation into whether I was swallowing tofu, mushroom, or heavily processed and keenly shaped meat protein, delicious in its spicing though it was. Eventually I offered, “That seems pretty solid as far as weird happenings plaguing a medieval countryside go.”

The reporter across from me winced. “That’s the good news. Around seven hundred years ago, something weird looking the same as now happened.”

“And the bad news?”

“Olf got driven off, but all that meant was that he didn’t go to the closest town for his supplies; he’s living that hermit life so no big issue. But when he goes to the next closest, the damned town of sinners, folk there are gossiping about how the rapture visited his old town. There was some big fire and a runner came and told sinner town to be ready because ‘the lord is welcoming the pure and innocent into his grace,’ or something like that. The translation software I was using could only do so much.”

I twirled my fork idly between my fingers as Linz finished eating. “Anything else?”

“Only pertinent notes in the week leading up to the end of June was that the woods were heavy with woodsmoke and dread approaching the solstice.”

“Ah. Not the best omen.”

Linz coughed a laugh. “Honestly a pretty tame omen in a diary dripping omens from each and every day. But the priest throwing stones at the town next door and then the town gets raptured or hit with some kind of catastrophe that almost sends everyone packing—it kind of got me thinking about hot spots. Maybe this Jêhana that’s approaching isn’t so much a thing as it a place, or a certain state of a place. Timing seems important. Nothing so grandiose as celestial alignments, but maybe the same way you can see a backyard during daytime and at night you know it’s there even if you can’t see in the dark. You can still SEE it in your mind even if you can’t see in the dark, but it‘s still the same place. The same location and if the right things happen, the place gets truer to itself.”

“Sounds ship of Theseus-y.” I leaned back and stared at the swirling patterns emerging in the dull popcorn ceiling hanging over us. An errant spider danced upside down along the pebbly terrain.

“Something like that. I’ve got a weird hunch I want to follow up on, but just do me a favour, okay? Stay inside for the solstice.”

“I don’t even know when that  is. Are you fully wearing a tinfoil hat now“

“Shut up and just stay inside Saturday and Sunday. It’s not like you’re out on the town every night anyway.“

“I go out! I go do things. I see people. I might even have a date this weekend.“

Linz fixed me with a bored, dubious look. “Do you have a date this weekend?”

“It’s early in the week: give me time.“ I said in mock outrage.

“It’s Thursday. Please stay in this weekend. There’s something bad in the reserve.”

The next day passed without incident and despite my jeers I had no real intention of pushing myself through the toil of arranging a date that would require me to dawn more than my cozy cold-weather sweat pants and fuzzy robes of increasingly ridiculous size and padding, even if the prospect of meeting someone new for romantic dalliances was of passing interest. My academic life and career had not afforded me many accommodations for romance, such were my areas of study, and the dating pool made up of my peers did more to drive me to a nunnery than elicit temptation or lust.

Nevertheless, I could not ignore the odd electric tension that I woke into that fateful Sunday. I had not seen Linz all weekend, and approaching noon my nervous tension broke.

I texted, “I don’t think you came home the last two nights, are you alright?” Twenty-three fretful minutes later I received my reply.

“Hunting down a lead. I’m close. I’ll know by noon.”

“Watch yourself. No point following a lead if you become the main story.” Linz started to reply but no text came through. Three blinking dots was all I received voicing their disagreement.

Noon came and went. “The world’s not ended, you still alive?” I sent, immediately regretting my attempt at a joke. Three damn dots. I called and it went to message. I called five more times over the next hour. I knew Linz would be furious if I called the cops on them. What would I even tell them? The reporter who just broke the scandal that killed your bosses is missing for an hour? I clutched my cold, half-drunk mug of spiked coffee and stared out at the sullen winter behind the frost-vignetted glass . The world outside lay sleeping under a soft blanket of white  while gossamer curtains of drifting sparkles tumbled down, glimmering in the harsh sunlight. 

I yelped and almost threw my phone across the room when it rang in my hand. 

Linz’s voice was panicked, hollow, and full of coughs. “Hey, it’s me. I found it—found Jêhana. I was too fucking late. I was on the right track, but I took too long to get here. Just ended up following the smoke through the trees, then when the way got denser, it was easier to follow the screams. They’ve been burning for hours now. Police are on their way. This thing, this is so much bigger than I thought, I—

“I was right and wrong. This is a place, a specific place in the reserve. That’s where I am now. I’m not moving from this place, I can’t right now, I just—look, I know none of the pigs or suits are going to believe me, so just hear me out. I just need to say it so I know I haven’t gone off teh deep end yet. This place wasn’t just a physical or temporal place—it’s both really—but it’s like a weird way of thinking. I started to get it, but then I got here to the clearing, and there were kids all lined up and just walking into the fire—I tried to stop them, but He was there, and everything went sideways. He did something to me, took my fucking eyes, but I can still see everything—it‘s like melted wax flowing everywhere, because I had eyes before, and now I’m thinking like this, and it doesn’t make sense, but I can see where I’ve been and am and will be going, and it feels like my head’s going to explode.”

Several hacking coughs and ragged gasps followed as my housemate fought for breath. I could almost smell the woodsmoke, the sticky fat-swelled acrid smog that was rising up into a swollen column of pitch. My hands were shaking.

Linz continued their recounting. “I can hear sirens closer now, thank god. They’ll be here soon as they get through the trees. I have to say this now before they get here. I’m sorry if they drag you into this—I’ll do what I can to keep them off you—I just needed to say it to someone, you know? Before I get slapped with “crazy asshole” and thrown into prison or some asylum.” 

The klaxon wail of police sirens rose louder and louder in the background, and the reporter’s tone became harder as it hushed. “Monsignor’s dead in front of me. I wish I had killed him but I didn’t. I don’t know if I could have, even knowing everything he’s—it doesn’t matter. Whatever that psychopath was doing, he managed to get Jêhana to come to him, or he forced it to be here, and then got himself thinking Jêhana and the murdering jack off did what he set out to do—he won alright—he just didn’t understand the path was one-way the wrong direction. Monsignor kicked opened the fucking door but couldn’t step through: something else came through instead. He came through. I don’t know where that oily bastard went after arm fucking Monsignor’s throat, but I don’t really care. Fucker took my eyes, went all melty casually walked off, stretching the snow as He went. He strolled away without a care, and now I’m trapped here in dim Jêhana. 

“Don’t come, I won’t be able to talk for a while. Thanks for everything and sorry for what’s next, I guess.” Linz said, their voice straining. The line went dead. I hadn’t managed to get a word out through their testament. 

I stared at the phone in my hand for a while. I couldn’t think of anything so fiercely that I started floating away from my thoughts, watching myself go rubbery as I teetered to my feet and followed myself already moving into the bedroom to put on real clothing, chasing the ghosts of before and after images of my body moving in slow deliberate motions, dressing and doing exactly what I’d been told not to. I saw it was coming, but I couldn’t do otherwise; it took painfully stubbing my toe to pull me back into myself, disassociated thoughts scattering as the blinding pain and crumpled nail channeled all my focus.

The cold winter air offered me no comfort, simply silent, watching weariness dragging on my bones. The black smoke plume licking at the pallid blue sky was direction enough, and I stomped through as yet unplowed streets. My friend had already been carted off and the trails cordoned and patrolled by the time I made my way down into the ice-bitten and hail-pocked reserve. I was turned away with stern warnings for my trudging troubles, angry officers barking at the crowds that were already forming and trying to figure out how best to bypass the roadblocks and circumvent the emergency tape binding trees together.

Monsignor’s murderous finale brought a terrible closure to the death spree. Linz’s testimony corroborated by the host of witness reports outlined a chilling schedule. Midmorning Sunday saw seven teenagers carry their infant siblings out of their respective houses—each front door having been carved and painted with the same circular blood graffiti overnight—and make their way down into the nature reserve to a previously unidentified clearing. A large A-frame bonfire had been prepared by Monsignor and was set aflame at noon. Each teen appears to have walked into the blaze at Monsignor’s direction and was promptly burned alive, each waiting their turn for self-immolation as if they were luxuriating in line for the last carnival ride of their young lives. For unknown reasons, campus security and the on-duty park rangers did not notice the notable column of black smoke, or ignored the obvious fire hazard for undetermined reasons. Linz arrived at the scene of the crime at 4:21 PM to find Monsignor dead at the foot of the hours-burning ritual pyre containing the charcoaling children victims. By the trails of footprints, Linz collapsed in the snow, immediately calling 911. Emergency services arrived on scene to find All twenty-one children ranging from several months to fourteen years already dead. Linz was still kneeling in the snow on the edge of hypothermia, intermittently laughing wretchedly and manically sobbing; their eyes had been burnt out of their head despite surrounding tissue showing minimal fire damage. The reporter was taken into custody and taken to hospital under armed guard while the sacrificial ritual site was processed.

Endless accusations, speculations, think pieces and allegations followed. My now-absent housemate lived shuttled between hospital and courts by sole reason of being the only living witness. Despite the horrible lambastations hurled at my friend, they endured their public pillory with stoic grace and removal, though I imagine that was at their attorney’s direction. I have not managed any contact with Linz. I have somehow avoided media attention almost entirely, though how exactly I cannot imagine. My friend has since been shifted in the spotlight to become the victimized reporter seeking justice unjustly punished for getting to close to the truth. There has been no mention of any strange footprints left in the snow that changed shape before disappearing, and the identification of Monsignor’s killer remains a mystery. I miss my friend, but their recovery is a long, dim road ahead of them, if such miracles are even possible.

Of late, I have been filled with a growling loneliness that has begun to fray the edges of my sense. My thoughts are too often displaced, hence this account, and I have not yet been able to return to my post. My alien and morphing disassociations have become more frequent as I dwell on this matter and how its invisible scars have been left even on those only tangibly related. I fear it to be so, but if there is any cursed truth to Linz’s parting words, heed me now as I unravel:

What Rose When the Light Called


¤¤¤¤¤



The house seemed to hold its breath.

Not silence exactly, more like anticipation, the way a storm pauses just before it decides where to break. 

The golden spill beneath Kai’s door did not move, did not fade. 

It waited, patient as law.

Aspen stood there a long second longer than necessary, caught between knowing and surrender, between the teenager he had been and the gravity now claiming him.

Then something inside him answered.

He rose. 
Unthinking. 
Barefoot. 

Hard.

Impossibly hard.

Each step closer to the door made his vision pulse. 

It hit him like collapse.

Not rage.
Not want.

But need, bloodthirsty, ancient, absolute.

Aspen's spine arched, his breath caught, and in the space between pulse and permission, the thing he kept chained inside him broke free.

It collapsed.

His shadow went first.

It peeled itself off the floor, no longer obeying the shape of his body, stretching wrong, deepening, folding inward as if gravity had decided to collect its debt. 

The light around him bent, dimming not by absence, but by surrender.

His breath changed.

Too slow.
Too steady.

Like something that no longer needed urgency.

The air thickened around him, pressure building until the room seemed to bow, walls creaking softly as though they recognized an apex presence. 

His spine straightened with unnatural precision, joints aligning too cleanly, too deliberately, like a machine locking into final configuration.

Aspen’s eyes went last.

The whites darkened first, swallowed by a depth that reflected nothing. 

When he looked up, there was no heat in them. 

No frenzy. 

Only knowing.

A smile touched his mouth, not wide, not cruel.

Certain.

That was when it landed.

This wasn’t indulgence.
This wasn’t hunger.

This was a predator that understood exactly what it was.

Who knew the score.

The thing inside him didn’t snarl or thrash. 

It settled. 
It claimed. 

It adjusted the world around itself as if reality were furniture that could be rearranged.

Aspen hadn’t become wild.

He had become functional.

A puppet.

And in that moment, with the room bent subtly toward him, with shadows responding like trained animals, the truth finally surfaced, undeniable and cold:

This wasn’t a man losing control.

This was a monster remembering how to stand.

His succubus flared.

Not in fire, but gravity.

Dark.

Unyielding.

Beautiful in its hunger.

It pulled like a black hole in the center of his chest, collapsing restraint, swallowing shame, demanding everything.

It didn’t look like heat so much as shadow learning how to breathe.

A low, velvety pressure unfurled from Aspen’s body, barely visible, felt more than seen, like dark silk moving through air. 

It curled in slow tendrils, tasting emotion the way fingers test fabric, brushing at fear, shame, and want with intimate precision. 

Wherever it passed, secrets stirred. 

It knew the hidden ache, the quiet hunger, the place where restraint thins and desire tells the truth.

It wasn’t seduction.

It was recognition.

And it knew exactly where to touch a soul to make it unravel.

He wasn’t asking anymore.

He was taking.



¤¤¤¤¤


THE ONLY THING THAT TASTES LIKE THAT 


¤¤¤¤¤


The charm. 

The grin. 

The game, all dropped like masks.

What remained was raw appetite, carved from shadow, velvet-tongued and wild-eyed.

He opened.

And the world bent toward him without protest.

The hallway lengthened. 

The walls sighed. 

The house opened its mouth.

And Aspen walked in.

Kai was not asleep.

He was suspended.

Floating inches above the mattress. 

Limbs loose. 

Head tilted back. 

His mouth open in a silent yes.

His body glowed. 

Faint gold flickers across collarbones, along ribs, down the hard lines of his thighs.

His briefs were soaked. 

The thick, veined shaft of his cock strained the fabric, arched slightly upward, twitching as if already in someone’s mouth.

Aspen moaned aloud.

Something moved through him.

Not Aspen. 
Not entirely.

The thing inside him rose like a tide.

It didn’t ask. 
It didn’t speak. 

It just wanted.

Aspen sank to his knees. 

Hands trembling. 

Eyes wet.

He pressed his forehead to Kai’s thigh. 

The heat radiating off Kais skin was ungodly. 

Alive. 
Divine.

His lips brushed the cotton. 

Soft. 

Once. 
Twice. 

Then he opened his mouth and licked.

Salt. 
Heat. 

Pre. 

Life.

He sobbed.

Once he had tasted it, there was only one possible outcome for Aspen. 

Nothing short of the harnessed force of a dying star could have stopped what had been awakened. 

He had no idea that danger could taste like heaven, or that what stirred inside him would never yield, never soften, until it had taken everything it wanted, even if the price was his own undoing.

Kai moaned in his sleep. 

Body arched. 

Cock jumped.

Aspen licked again. 

Open-mouthed. 

Tongue dragging slowly over the leaking bulge.

He couldn’t stop shaking.

This was not desire.

This was fate.

As he began peeling Kai free, the air changed.

Not sharply, not all at once, but in layers, like a memory unfolding. 

Warm ozone first, rain hitting stone after heat. 

Then something sweeter underneath, honeyed and mineral, the clean salt of skin touched by light. 

It carried the faintest trace of smoke, not fire, but what fire leaves behind when it has passed through something sacred.

It was a scent that didn’t sit in the nose so much as bloom in the chest, dense and inviting, ancient and alive. 

Breathing it in felt like standing too close to a threshold, like knowing you should step back and finding your feet already moving forward.

It smelled like power made intimate.

Like danger softened just enough to be mistaken for grace.

He continued to peeled the fabric down slowly.

Reverently. 

As if every inch unveiled was a stanza of a gospel.

Something hit Aspen the moment he got close enough to breathe Kai in.

Not scent.

Not musk.

Something deeper.

A signal.

An ache.

An imprint so potent it curled straight into the root of him and dragged his incubus nature by the collar like a beast hearing its true name.

The air around Kai was charged, warm, dense, laced with the kind of masculine heat that lived beneath language, beneath flesh, beneath memory itself.

Aspen’s cock jumped in his briefs, hard enough to make him gasp, pre continously leaking, soaking, wetting the cotton.

He hated how fast it happened.

How automatic.
How inevitable.

His hunger surged, flaring through him like a devil’s grin, sharp and molten.

It wasn’t just arousal.

It was calling.

Kai’s presence alone felt like gravity bending toward a star, a pull Aspen’s body answered before his mind could resist.


¤¤¤¤¤


IF IT HAS A FLAVOR, IT’S A GOD 


¤¤¤¤¤


He swallowed hard.

His thighs trembled.

The creature in his blood purred, stretching, remembering what it was.

He wasn’t supposed to feel this much this close.

He wasn’t supposed to want this violently.

But the truth hit him in a single, brutal wave:

Kai wasn’t just someone he desired.

Kai was the one thing his hunger was born to kneel for.

And Aspen was already on the edge of falling.

Kai’s cock sprang free, thick, flushed, slick. 

The head pulsed with sacred rhythm, a bead of honey-light forming at the slit.

Aspen kissed it.

Then again.

Aspen’s lips barely touched the drop, but the world tilted.

It wasn’t just salt and honey.

It was history.

A taste that pulled a thousand ancestors through his throat.

He felt them move, warriors, witches, wild men and half-gods, all pressing forward, humming in his bones.

The flavor wasn’t flavor.

It was becoming.

Like sweat drawn from starlight.

Like the first drink after centuries of thirst.

A scared drop of Ambrosia.

Sweet water tapped from the sacred source.

Aspen moaned, not from pleasure, but recognition.

This was not hunger anymore.

This was ascension.

His body flushed, hips already rolling, heat pooling so fast he thought he might catch fire.

He wasn’t supposed to survive this.

He was supposed to meet it.

And he was.

Right then.
Right there.

From taste alone.

Then he opened his mouth.

And took the god inside.

The moment Kai skin touched his mouth, the world detonated inward.

Not taste as the body understands it, but impact, like plugging directly into a star. 

Heat without burn. 

Light without mercy. 

Aspen’s breath hitched as if his chest had been cracked open and something infinite had been poured straight through him.

Emotion came first. 

Awe. 

Terror. 

Devotion. 

A rush so vast it blurred into need.

His body answered before thought could intervene, every nerve lighting at once, pressure building faster than it could be contained. 

It felt as though his own frame was suddenly insufficient, as if no human shape had ever been meant to hold this much want, this much insistence.

By gods, the hunger.

Not desire as indulgence, but requirement. 

A gravitational demand.

Something inside him surged forward, relentless, certain, convinced it had finally found what it had been built to receive.

Aspen knew, with a clarity that terrified him, that restraint was no longer part of the equation.

This wasn’t lust.

It was alignment at full force.

And once connected, he understood there would be no gentle release, only the question of whether he would survive the wanting of it.

He moaned as he fed. 

Sucked slowly, deep. 

Hands cradling Kai’s hips like reliquaries.

Kai breathed once, a sharp inhale through parted lips.

Tears filled Aspens eyes.

Kai’s cock stretched his throat.

The taste wrecked him, salt and sunlight and ancient things.

He didn’t gag.

He received.

He worked his lips down, deeper.

Let his jaw fall open. 

His whole body shook with worship.

A single truth ripped through Aspen with merciless clarity: 

This was his deepest desire. 

Not indulgence, not impulse, but a birthright long deferred.

Without fulfilling it, he would never have been whole. 

Kai had called his succubus nature forward without knowing it, not as conquest, but as alignment, drawing it into service by simply being what he was.

This was always the price. 

And always the bait.

And Kai gave.

Thrusted gently in his sleep.

Offereing himself.

Aspen hollowed his cheeks, massaged the shaft, pressed forward until his nose touched the dark thatch of golden curls.

The Archive sang in the walls.

Symbols flickered.

Time bowed.

Aspen’s paused before his mouth came down on him again, before devotion turned into destiny, the air itself hesitated, as if remembering what lived inside Kai.

Because this wasn’t just a teenager floating in a glow.

This was thirty days of restraint
compressed into bone, into blood, into the molten center of him.

Manna from heaven.

This was the ritual.

The one older than his name,
older than the Archive, older than the ocean that birthed his father.

Kai had held back every pulse,
every instinct, every drop of what his body begged to release.

Not to deny himself, to contain himself.

To keep the timelines from fraying.

To keep the world from bending.

To keep creation from answering him too quickly.

The seed he carried wasn’t metaphor.

It was power.

Raw.

Unfiltered.

Untamed.

What he held inside him could rewrite memory, ignite bloodlines,
wake buried gods.

His body was a vessel tightened to the brink, a chalice shaking under the weight of a storm.

Aspen shouldn't have been alone.

Should have been Protected.

Guarded.


¤¤¤¤¤

YOU DON’T TASTE POWER UNLESS IT’S SACRED 

¤¤¤¤¤



But Aspen was here.

And the moment he touched him, the ritual would no longer be ritual.

It would be release.

It would be consequence.

It would be becoming.

The glow around Kai flickered once, recognizing the crossing.

Then Aspen leaned in.

And destiny opened its mouth.

He couldn’t believe it was real.

He was on his knees.

And Kai was in his mouth.

The weight of him, thick, hot, holy rested heavy on his tongue like a secret he wasn’t supposed to know.

He felt it all.

Every inch of his beautiful cock.

The heat.

The smooth, stretched skin.

The subtle, sacred pulse that throbbed through the length like a second heartbeat.

Kai’s heartbeat.

In his mouth.

Aspen moaned around him, low, guttural, helpless.

The vibration made Kais cock pulse, and the twitch, made him ache.


Aspen’s succubus nature reeled in quiet joy. 

Not at bodies, but at truth. 

Its tendrils brushed the field of him, counting lovers not by flesh but by imprint, by the shadows people left behind when they believed no one was looking. 

It knew their secrets. 

Their hungers. 

The soft, hidden fractures they carried like talismans.

And then it turned its sight on Kai.

It read him like scripture.

So clean it almost hurt. 

So untouched by misuse, by appetite taken too early or too cheaply. 

The succubus stilled, startled by the purity of the pattern, and for the first time in its long remembering, it almost wept.

Aspen had known war. 

He had known bodies. 

He had known endings stacked one after another, a veteran of both duty and desire. 

His ledger was full.

Kai’s was not.

Kai was untouched by the world’s taking.

And the cycle that now opened before Aspen, the thirty-nine days written into his becoming, would be a brew never repeated, never diluted. 

Not conquest. 

Not theft. 

But threshold.

He understood then what had been entrusted to him. 

Not possession, but witness. 

Not indulgence, but reverence.

Somewhere beyond names and authorship, the Gods smiled.

Because a god’s first yes is not taken.

It is given.

This was no act.

No fantasy.

No stolen dream in the dark.

This was now.

Aspen could barely breathe, not from lack of air, but from the overwhelming truth of it.

The scent, musk and salt and something ancient, flooded his nose.

The taste, clean and deep and addictive, stayed on the back of his tongue like myth.

He hollowed his cheeks, lips stretched wide, letting himself feel the weight of Kai slide deeper.

His throat opened willingly.

It wasn’t about submission.

It was about reverence.

Kai was warm thunder in his mouth.

A living storm.



¤¤¤¤¤


A Theorem on Gods: Proof by Tongue


¤¤¤¤¤



And Aspen, weeping, moaning, undone, drank the moment like worship.

Kai arched, not like a boy losing control, but like a constellation snapping into alignment.

His whole body convulsed in a single, seismic wave, every muscle drawn tight as if lightning had gripped him from the inside.

The glow beneath his skin flared white‑gold, pure enough to blind the room if the room had dared to look.

It hit him then.

The rush.

The rupture.

The breaking-open of a month’s worth of held cosmos.

His body didn’t just release.

It unleashed.

A cascade of force surged through him, violent and holy,
older than breath, older than words.

His hips jerked as though a wild horse had burst out of his spine,
raw, furious, alive, and Aspen, trembling, anchored himself against the storm.

Aspen became the vessel.

The tether.

The impossible saddle on a creature that was never meant to be ridden.

If a mortal had taken even a mouthful of what Kai’s ritual had condensed they wouldn’t have survived it.

The power would have erased them from lineage, from memory,
from the Archive itself.

A human throat would have torn.

A human mind would have burned.

A human soul would have been written out of history like a sentence the universe regretted speaking.

But Aspen wasn’t mortal.

Not anymore.

What lived in his blood now, the curse that had once hunted him,
the hunger he had feared, was one of only a few beings on earth strong enough to receive Kai without being destroyed.

Kai’s release struck him like revelation.

Like fire drinking oxygen.

Like a star collapsing and being reborn inside his ribs.

This was no climax.

This was convergence.

A merging of myth and hunger,
ritual and ruin, power and the one person built to withstand it.

Kai was not meant for mortal touch.

Anything less would have been annihilation.

But Aspen endured.

Aspen survived.

Aspen took it in and became something else.

A flood. 

Hot. 

Gold. 

Alive.

He drank.

Gulped. 

Groaned. 

Trembled.

His body glowed. 

His curse cracked.

The shadows in his blood screamed as they were burned away.

He sucked until Kai was empty.

Until nothing remained but the shine of light in his chest.

He pulled off slowly. 

Kissed the softening head once.

It hit him without warning.

The moment Kai’s taste touched, and settled on his tongue, that salt‑gold spark, that living vow, something inside Aspen snapped its chains.

Heat punched through his spine.

Not lust.

Not pleasure.

Something older.

A release that wasn’t release at all, but an eviction.

His body seized, bowed, shuddered, and then he erupted.

His cock pulsing like shock waves from a dieing star.

It tore out of him like a dam finally allowed to fail, a flood that had been held back since the first curse whispered his name.

He came like a man being emptied, poured out,
purged.

A groan ripped out of him, raw, almost wounded, as if the darkness that had ruled him
was being forced out through every shaking inch of him,
spilling from him in hot, relentless waves.

It didn’t stop.

Wouldn’t stop.



¤¤¤¤¤


WHILE THE THRESHOLD WAS STILL OPEN 


¤¤¤¤¤



His whole body convulsed again, muscles locking, hips jerking,
as if lifetimes of hunger
were being expelled in one long, blinding surge.

He felt himself unraveling, not falling apart, being cleared out.

Being made ready.

It kept coming, another pulse, another violent bright shudder,
holy and humiliating all at once.

Tears burned his eyes.

It felt like a hand inside his soul
was wringing out the poison,
draining the curse, emptying the vessel of everything he had been
so there would be room for what was coming.

Room for what was blessed.

By the time the final tremor left him, Aspen was shaking from head to toe, sweat shining down his spine, breath shredded,
knees weak.

He knew, without needing words for it, that this wasn’t release.

This was rebirth.

The old hunger had been forced out of him in one long, shuddering, unstoppable offering…

…so the new power could take its throne.

Then collapsed.

Something broke open inside him.

Not shattered, unlocked.

Aspen gasped, his lips still wet with Kai’s light, his chest heaving like he’d surfaced from drowning in stars.

The seed didn’t just nourish, it rewrote.

It wasn’t submission.

It was recognition.

Power surged through him, not borrowed, not stolen, but bestowed.

The shadows in his blood recoiled, thrashed once, then bowed.

His spine arched, not in pain, but in arrival.

As if something buried in the marrow of his being had finally found its signal.

Something ancestral.

Predatory.

Royal.

Not dominance.

Dominion.

His breath came in low, reverent pulls.

Every nerve sang.

Every cell aligned.

He blinked, and the world snapped into a clarity he had never known, like fog burned off by divine fire.

This was not about serving Kai.

Not anymore.

This was about stepping into the throne that had waited for him, empty, hidden in the shadow of desire.

He felt it now:

The throne was inside him.

Carved from longing.

Crowned with fire.

Anchored by the one truth he could no longer run from.

Aspen wasn't becoming something else.

He was becoming himself.

The myth behind his curse.

The king inside the hunger.

And as the last of Kai’s light settled into his gut like a sun choosing its home, Aspen didn’t flinch.

He rose.

Not in defiance.

But in ascendancy.

A voice moved through the room.

Not sound. 
Not words.

But truth.

""We granted your request,"" it said.

""His seed you may carry. 

His life you may serve. 

But his heart? 

Never.""

Aspen sobbed harder.

Kai stirred. 

Just slightly. 

Whispered a breath.

And then, silence.

Aspen staggered back, breath raw, lips still shining with divinity.

The light that had filled the room began to dim, no, not dim, soften. 

The light held Kai as if it knew how to carry gods, not with urgency, but reverence.

It moved like, breath being held in a cathedral.

Slowly, it cradled Kai’s glowing body and began to lower him, gentle as moonlight over holy water.

Kai’s body descended through the charged stillness like a relic lowered into velvet, every inch a ceremony, every breath a rite.

His back touched the sheets like a chalice being placed back in velvet, precise, honored, untouched by haste.

His legs, long and muscled, floated slightly apart,
not spread in weakness, but opened like pillars accepting their temple's crown.

Thighs carved with the memory of motion, calves tight with ancestral instruction.

He was built like something meant to move oceans…

and had.

His torso glowed faintly,
not a shine, but a density, like the collapsed light of a dying star refusing to dim.

Abs tight, sharply defined, as if discipline had been braided into his flesh.

His skin was dusk-kissed gold, flushed with heat and ritual ache.

And at the center of it all, resting proud and heavy across his lower belly, was the proof of his lineage, not just arousal, but design.

There was nothing accidental about the shape of him.

He was the perfect accord between forces,

Blade and Pillar.

Length like a tempered sword, precision-forged.

Girth like the base of an altar, thick with gravity.

A weapon. 

A chalice. 

A riddle.

The head flushed, haloed with light.

Veins faintly aglow, like ley lines drawn through flesh.

Not obscene.

Never that.

Just truth, embodied.

His cock was not made to conquer.

It was made to catalyze.

To awaken.

To remember.

It curved slightly upward with divine arrogance, the kind of presence that asked for no permission and needed none.

His face, still soft in the hush of surrender, held the masculinity of mountains, jawline etched like prophecy, lashes long, lips parted in that final unspoken

 “yes.”

The room didn't dare exhale.

He wasn’t just beautiful.

He was balance incarnate.

The sacred edge between offering and power, between thunder and restraint.

This was Kai, not as teenager, not as lover, but as myth.

Laid bare.

Laid down.

Crowned in heat and devotion.

A living bridge between the Archive and the ache of every body that would ever long for something holy.

Kai had held back. 

Aspen was the one transformed.

What Kai received was something that might have crossed his mind once, when Aspen’s stare lingered too long, and Kai had read it clearly, and said yes. 

The Archive made it so, because Kai was not like the rest, reserved for the very few. 

Aspen would live on that knowledge alone.

He watched, heart thundering, the air still thick with the scent of sweat, salt, and sanctity.

Then he turned, still trembling, and stepped barefoot into the hallway, light closing softly behind him like a benediction.

Aspen curled into himself.

Tears dried on his cheeks.

His body hummed with rebirth.

But his heart cracked.

Because even in his salvation, he knew what he’d never touch.

Could never touch.




¤¤¤¤¤


Taste, Memory, Love 


¤¤¤¤¤


The morning was cruel in how ordinary it looked.

Sunlight through curtains.

Birdsong. 

The distant hum of a snowblower.

But Aspen woke up different.

He sat on the couch where he’d fallen, blinking into the pale light, his chest bare, his breath calm.

For the first time in weeks, maybe months, he didn’t feel hunted by his own hunger.

He felt… powerful.

Not frantic. 
Not starving. 

Not cracked at the edges.

Just alive.

The incubus curse still lived inside him, but now it bowed to him.

He stretched slowly, fingers flexing like they belonged to a new animal.

He looked down at his body. 

The glow was gone. 

But the memory wasn’t.

Kai’s cock. 

The warmth. 

The flood.

His mind flashed with it. 

The scent. 

The way the moan curled out of Kai’s chest like a spell.

He swallowed and exhaled hard.

""God,"" he whispered. 

“I didn’t think I could love him more.”

Then he laughed, short, breathless.

""And I don’t even like guys.”

""Just him.""

He rubbed his face. 

Sat forward.

No one stirred yet. 

Kai’s room was quiet.

 Still.

Aspen closed his eyes a moment longer.

He wouldn’t forget. 

Ever.

Not because of the act.

Because of the gift.

Because Kai, without knowing, without asking, had saved his life.

And even if he never had his heart, he’d carry that offering like a star in his gut for the rest of his life.

Somewhere deep in the silence, Aspen swore he heard it again:

“His seed you may carry. 
His life you may serve. 

But his heart?""

This time.

He nodded to the emptiness.

Not bitter. 
Not broken. 

Just changed.

Because loving Kai wasn’t the curse.

It was the price of being saved.



¤¤¤¤¤

Unspoken tribute 


¤¤¤¤¤


Kai woke slowly.

Not from sleep.

From return.

From the long drift back into his body after a night that had pulled something ancient through his veins.

His eyes opened to the familiar ceiling, the one he’d stared at a thousand times, yet it felt like the first time he'd ever really seen it.

The morning light touched him gently, as if it knew better than to approach too boldly.

His limbs were heavy.

His breath deep.

His pulse slow and deliberate.

He felt…emptied and refilled.

Burned and blessed.

Human and not.

A hum lived under his ribs,
the soft afterglow of a ritual completed, a chord that still vibrated long after the note had ended.

He didn’t know why his throat felt dry, why his cock ached faintly, why his chest thrummed with something like release
or surrender

or both.

He only knew the night had done something.

To him,

Through him.

Beyond him.

He sat up.

Static danced across his skin
like a lover trailing their fingers up his arms.

The sheets were a subtle mess,
creased, warm, touched by more than sleep.

He didn’t remember undressing.

Didn’t remember lying down.

But he felt… tended to.

Cared for.

Held.

Like the night itself had touched him and then stepped back into shadow.

The hallway outside creaked,
a careful step, a breath held too long.

Aspen.

Kai didn’t need to see him to know.

His presence stirred the air
with that strange cocktail of swagger, spark, and something darker curled under the ribs.

Something newly quiet.

Kai exhaled, stood, pulled on sweats.

Opened his door.

Aspen froze mid-step.

Shirtless.

Hair mussed.

Eyes still touched with echo
of something he couldn’t name.

Their gazes caught,
soft, brief, magnetic.

Not desire.

Not awkwardness.

Recognition.

Two boys standing in the aftershock of something holy
with no earthly language for it.


¤¤¤¤¤


The God Of Desire Reborn


¤¤¤¤¤



Aspen knelt, trembling.

Not from weakness.

From wonder.

From what he had discovered.

From the raw, dizzying magnitude of what he beheld.

Now, finally, he knew what Kai was, or rather, what he wasn’t.

Not just blood and breath.

Not just teenager or myth.

But something older.

Stranger.

Woven from stars no telescope could name.

And yet,

Aspen still didn’t know who Kai was.

What force had shaped him.

What dream or disaster had summoned him into this skin.

He didn’t care.
He couldn’t.

Because whatever Kai was…

Aspen loved him.

Not gently.
Not safely.

But with the wild, feral certainty of something born to protect.

He would kneel.
He would rise.

He would burn kingdoms to ash for this youth,

this god,

this question in human skin.

Anyone who tried to hurt him wouldn’t make it to a second breath.

Because Aspen wasn’t just awestruck anymore.

He was claimed.

And he would ruin the world to keep Kai safe.

Kai stood there.

Still.

Barefoot.

Joggers clinging low to his hips, fabric damp with sweat and sleep and something older.

His bulge hung heavy, proud, the weight of it impossible to ignore, not obscene, but inevitable.

Like gravity.

Like stormlight.

Like myth.

The shape of him was poetry etched in flesh.

Thighs carved, thick with power.

Abs etched in slow, divine geometry, a sacred rigging across golden skin that shimmered faintly, as if lit from within.

His chest rose and fell with effortless command, as if the air itself asked permission to enter him.

But it was the way he stood, unmoved, unbothered, yet utterly awake, that made the world pause.

This was not a teenager.

This was a god caught mid-transformation.

A being forged of legacy and lawless desire, veined with divinity, standing in cotton and calm like the moment before thunder strikes.

And beneath that cotton?

The outline of him strained boldly against the fabric.

Thick.

Long.

Alive.

A weapon shaped for worship.

The kind of cock stories forgot how to tell because it was never meant to be described, only experienced.

His body didn’t boast.

It testified.

Aspen couldn’t stop going over it in his mind’s eye, the moment unfolding again and again, each pass leaving him more undone.

And everything in the room, even the shadows, leaned toward him.

Kai didn’t pose.

He didn’t need to.

He was already the altar.

And the offering.

And the fire.

“You good?”

Aspen swallowed.

Hard.

“Yeah,” he said.

Then softer.

“Better than I’ve been in a long time.”

He tried to grin, and almost managed it.

Almost hid the tremble
that wasn’t fear but reverence.

Kai nodded slowly.

Something inside him warmed at Aspen’s voice, at the honesty in it, at the gratitude he didn’t speak.

Good.

He didn’t know why he felt protective.

Why Aspen looked different to him.

Why the air between them felt threaded with something
that hadn’t been there yesterday.

But he didn’t question it.

Kai had learned long ago:

when the world rearranges itself,
you just breathe and let it finish.

In the kitchen, the house behaved strangely.

The kettle turned on by itself.

The lights flickered once, in greeting, not warning.

The shadows in the corners looked softer, as if bowed.

Aspen followed Kai into the kitchen and leaned against the counter, arms crossed, a heat in his body he couldn’t shake but no longer feared.

Kai poured coffee.

Two mugs.

Instinct.

He slid one toward Aspen.

Their fingers didn’t touch, but the air did.

A quiet spark.

A hint of last night.

A whisper of something ancient
still settling.

Aspen looked at him like he was seeing him for the first time.

Like something had been fulfilled.

And something else had begun.

Kai felt the weight of that stare.

Didn’t shy from it.

Held it.

Just long enough.

Then,

“Want breakfast?”

Kai asked.

Aspen’s grin returned,
real this time.

“Hell yes.”

And the house,
the old, patient house,
seemed to sigh in relief.

As if the night had passed.

As if the morning had begun.

As if the world, for now,
was allowed to be gentle.

Somewhere, far from clocks and fireworks, the new year had already ended.

Not in noise.

Not in countdowns.

But in the soft rearranging of breath and bone.

In the hush that follows choosing.

In the hum that follows becoming.

Aspen felt it settle in his chest,
not like a decision, but a marking.

The teenager who had arrived at the party hours ago would not be the one who left.

Nor would any of them.

Not Sequoia with her coiled grace.

Not Mike with his stillness like prophecy.

Not even Kai, glowing faintly in sleep, body carved in devotion and myth.

This year would stretch differently.

This would be the summer everything unfolded.

For Kai?

It would be the summer he would meet his match, the one the old myths whispered about in half-sentences and thunderstorms, the one meant to hold time and thunder with him,
not behind, not below, but beside.

They hadn’t crossed paths yet.

But time had already turned its face toward them.

And the summer would not come gently.

The air already knew.

So did the Archive.

A new line had begun.

And none of them would ever be the same.

""Echoes That Don’t Leave Clean""


¤¤¤¤¤



 
(New Year’s Day - Aspen, After Kai)


Aspen didn’t remember the Uber home.

Only the silence.

Only the way the night had pressed its weight into his throat like a vow he hadn’t meant to make.

By the time he stepped into his mansion, the walls greeted him like a cathedral returning its prodigal son.

He didn’t go to bed.

He went straight to the bathroom.

The steam rose without instruction.

And in the mirror, the teenager who had tasted god stood still
and waited to become someone new.

The walls were warm marble, veined like ancient rivers.

The floors radiant with heat.

The ceiling high, recessed lights dimmed to mimic dawn.

A rain-shower still dripped behind him.

The steam hung like breath caught in prayer.

He stood there, bare chest, towel low, skin still humming.

Sunlight poured through the glass wall that overlooked the private garden, slanting across his collarbones like scripture.

But Aspen didn’t move.

He stared at himself.

Not in vanity.
Not in shame.

In wonder.

Like he was still trying to understand who had walked into that room with Kai last night…

and what had walked out.

His body looked the same.

Sharp.

Golden.

Built like temptation wrapped in privilege.

But something had shifted.

Not outside.

Within.

He touched his lips.

A memory flickered.

Heat.

Salt.

The weight of something holy across his tongue.

His breath trembled, not from arousal, from the echo of something larger than lust.

Something sacred.

He had been changed.

Not corrupted.

Not converted.

Transformed.

By what he had tasted.

By what he now carried.

By who Kai truly was.

It hadn’t been desire.

Not exactly.

It had been pull.

It had been summons.

It had been a rite wearing the face of a teenager.

And now…

He stood in the hush of his marble palace, still not knowing how to carry what had entered him into a world built to forget things like this.

He gripped the sink edge,
not tight, just enough to not float off.

Because that’s what it felt like.

Like something inside him had become buoyant.

Like a sun had lodged behind his ribs and no longer needed permission to shine.

And yet, there was SHAME.

Not for the act.

But for how deeply he had needed it.

The awe.

The hunger.

The surrender.

What would it feel like to have it again?

He tried to cast the thought aside.

But it didn’t leave clean.

In the vast hush of his house, silence reigned.

Aspen thought.

You grow up thinking life is about being good.

About sharing.

About charity as virtue.

And with age, you learn that this is true, but incomplete.

Because generosity is not a moral suggestion.

It is a universal law.

What you place into the world is what the world is able to return to you. 

There is a spiritual economy at work, precise and indifferent, keeping account whether you believe in it or not. 

Some lives fracture not from curses or malice or the so-called evil eye, but from empty accounts, years of withholding, of fearing loss, of never risking the full measure of the heart.

There is no affliction in that.

Only imbalance.

The ambrosia made this visible to Aspen.

Standing before the mirror, breath still uneven, he saw it all at once, not judgment, but clarity. 

His eyes burned, wet with tears he hadn’t earned until now, because Kai had done something far more dangerous than saving him.

Kai had set his spirit free.

And in doing so, had caged his heart.

That was the price.

That was the gift.

And Aspen understood, finally, that freedom without possession can still be the deepest form of devotion.

But inside Aspen?

Something had begun to roar.

Downstairs, staff would be preparing the brunch tray.

The world would think it was just a lazy New Year’s Day.

But here…

Here, in this sacred quiet, Aspen knew:

Everything had changed.

Not just for him.

For all of them.

This wasn’t just a new year.

It was a threshold.

It had arrived not like a ceremony,
but like a giant had left his door open and a strange new wind had blown in.

A shift was coming.

A storm they hadn’t named yet.

A lover.

A rival.

A test.

Kai would soon meet his match,
the one fated to carry time and thunder beside him.

But Aspen...

Aspen had his own vow now.

He didn’t just serve Kai.

He would shield him.

Build what was needed.

Become what the Archive had whispered into his spine.

They had granted his request.

But not gently.

Not without condition.

And in that holy, golden bathroom, with steam in the air and the taste of myth still on his lips, Aspen heard the echo again, not in sound, but in knowing:

“His seed you may carry.

His life you may serve.

But his heart?

Never.”

He didn’t cry.

Not this time.

He simply nodded to his reflection, the new one.

The one he hadn’t known until  last night.

Because loving Kai wasn’t the curse.

It was the price of being chosen.

I’m just curious…if the general amount needed for adults is 6-18mg, and 27mg for pregnant women…how am I still deficient?? Where does it go? Or is it just not being absorbed? I know calcium and coffee can hinder absorption so maybe that’s it, just seems like between that and the food I eat there should be enough to go around so just had me wondering…

1pqa7j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RoomtasticRentastic/comments/1pqa7j4/1400_sunny_12x15_room_on_ocean_parkway_comes_with/,"1400 Sunny 12x15 Room on Ocean Parkway, comes with a prefab family","This one won’t be for everyone: Do you want to have \_a\_ family around, just not \_your\_ family?

Our two-parent, two-teenager household lives between two apartments in the same building. One of them is not full-time occupied—there's a little washer and dryer, a guest room we use, and your room. You could think of your (sunny, prewar) room as like a finished basement or a garage? It’s part of a family home, but it's often empty.

Foot traffic:  
We’re in and out 24/7 for laundry and storage and zoom meetings and sleepovers, but then it’ll go quiet for a few days. Sometimes one of us camps out for a weekend. Sometimes kids hang out watching videos (with headphones). Sometimes our literal guests stay in the guest room. But you would be the main person there every night, and the main person with shampoo in the shower. None of us live there full time, though eventually one or two of us may.

Your room:  
Your room is 12 by 15 feet, 180sf, though some of it is taken up by a six-foot wide, 30-inch deep closet that goes up to the 9-foot ceiling. That leaves 165 sf of open floor. There are two sunny west/southwest facing windows. They look out on multi-lane traffic, plus a lot of trees and sky. Unfurnished. The wood floors are beautiful, but a building noise-reduction rule requires rugs over 80% of them.

Shared spaces:  
The living room, kitchen, and bath are shared. There isn’t a tv in the living room, or shelving, or decor, and for us that’s ideal. Keeping it minimal for now. We'll be in and out of the bathroom and kitchen. We store some things in the kitchen, but it’s not our million-meals-a-day cooking environment.

Utilities:  
The room has a new window a/c. In heat season, with radiators, you’re more likely to be too warm than too cold. Half of gas, electric, and wifi has been about 75/month, probably higher in a/c season.

Building:  
The building is a family-oriented walkup coop, fairly diverse, and lgbt friendly. Four(?) of the 40 apartments are supportive housing for developmentally disabled adults. There are multiple outdoor spaces, including front yard and courtyard, plus a long, skinny back courtyard (or is it an alley?) where people do some vegetable gardening. Take a raised bed in the spring, there is no waitlist. The front yard is basically decorative, but the courtyard is comfortable. It’s shown in aerial view in the photos. There’s a commercial laundry room in the basement. And just to repeat the word walkup again, it’s a walkup. Building quiet hours are 10pm to 9am, and we have to take them seriously because the super lives directly below this space.

Neighborhood:  
You can walk around the block and hit laundromats, delis, coffee, and takeout without crossing the street. More coffee, some bars, and a bookstore within a few blocks. Bigger grocery stores and more serious restaurants 5-10 minutes walk. Ten minutes to Greenwood Cemetery or Prospect Park.

Transit:  
We are 0.3 miles to either the Fort Hamilton F/G (the directions say 8-minute walk ) or Church Ave F/G (9 minutes). The B and D are farther, 0.7 miles (16 minutes), but the bus often gets you to them quickly. There are two Citibike racks within a block.

About us:  
Nerds for sure. Our current employers include: a bookstore, a publisher, a parenting group. The kids are pretty mild for teenagers. So far. Our main need is to feel comfortable running into you, and to sense that you're comfortable running into us.

About you:  
We enjoy students and artists, and we plan to enjoy meeting you, whoever you are. We'll have to collaborate on cleaning and maintenance—are you ok to collaborate on cleaning and maintenance? And you'd have to live with unpredictably in-and-out housemates. Also with kids. You’d want to be better than ok with kids. You'd want to feel comfortable being part of a household ecosystem, even just as a satellite.

Long-range stayability:  
If you were happy and comfortable, and you wanted to stay, it might be possible to get past the building’s two-year sublet limit. If one of us eventually slept full-time in the guest room, then the limited-term ""sublet"" could become a longer-term ""roommate” situation.

Possibles and impossibles:  
Couples, impossible. Loudness or hosting hookups or parties, also impossible. Basement bike storage, possible. Storage in closets outside your room, impossible. Small, lovely neutered dogs maybe possible? Cats, impossible (allergies).

How-to:  
Because we’re a family and because it’s a coop building, this takes more oomph than an average shared rental. Steps:

1. Phone call? If you wish.
2. Come see.
3. If it's any kind of match, come meet the kids.
4. If that works, we'll send you the application form.
5. Enter the paperwork tunnel: Do you have two school or work-related recommendation letters? Great, PDF them. If not, have a boss and/or family friend write some. Filed taxes? Great, attach the top page. Ditto bank statements. Ditto pay stubs.
6. Send it all back and the board will approve it. (We're on the board.)
7. Sign a lease.

I’m looking to hopefully make a connection that leads to some romance! Posting on Reddit again (dating apps are still killing me sos) as I’ve met some great folks on here and I’m still hoping to find someone who matches my energy! 😂

A lil about me, I am a cis lady, from Canada. I am pretty femme, and I’d say I have a very cute, comfortable/casual style. I do want to get a few more tattoos in the future as well! I am about 5’5ish, average size ish (A lil chubby, but not plus size.), dark brunette and have brown eyes. In terms of like actual hobbies I do spend most of my free time doing fibre crafts. I do love napping when I can, I do smoke sometimes, I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch. I also love pets, if you have one send pics PLZ. I have an alright job, a few close friends and a boring life so overall my life is pretty quiet and drama free! Really just looking to share in the monotony of day to day life with someone, the highs and lows and whatever falls between those places too. 😊

Im not really dead set on someone particular or a “type” I’m looking for (slight preference for mascs but? Not a huge deal lol), I’m very chatty and am hoping you are too though! I’d love to hear about your day everyday, your hobbies, yours passions and everything else going on! Also please have a good sense of humour! I would prefer if you were close ish to my age or a bit older (25+), and preferably from Canada or North America? I can’t do huge time zone differences, I sleep too much! 😂 I am also monogamous relationship wise, very on the fence about kids, and want to be around people who share the same values (Politically left and an atheist.) Also happy to swap selfies if you wanna see who you’re talking to! 

Please if you do reach out, please tell me your age, where you’re from and a little blurb about you so we can get to chitty chatting! I’d love to hear about your plans for the holidays, and see if you were naughty or nice this year! 😂",7,1766113258.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

My stable stuttered and I think —

Now happily the devil walks on the ceiling.

You say he's happier on the ceiling but I—

The window lets in a black universe

And as we drink our coffee, 

Your blonde hair vies meekly for my attention 

It speaks of submission and posture.

I hold your hand, the cups start dancing 

The whole kitchen erupts in a riot of light— 

I think I don't want to let it go.

1pqa34w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1pqa34w/people_we_love/,People we love,"Some people asked me once why I don't just reach out if I still care. And I didn't know how to explain it. How do you tell someone that love and wanting someone in your life are completely separate things? That you can hold affection for someone and also know, with absolute certainty, that reconnecting would ruin it? 

Because I know what would happen. We'd meet for coffee. It would be awkward. We'd try to catch up but realize we don't actually have the foundation for it anymore. We'd be forcing conversation like strangers at a networking event. And then we'd leave and never do it again, but now the memory would be tainted with that disappointment. 

Better to keep them preserved exactly as they are. In the past. In theory. It's the perfect relationship, in a way. All the warmth, none of the work. 

Sometimes I wonder if I exist like this for other people. If there's someone out there who thinks of me fondly every few months but would panic if I actually texted them. If I'm someone's theoretical person. Someone they love in a way that requires my absence. 

That should feel sad, but it doesn't. It feels kind of beautiful, actually. To matter to someone without mattering to their daily life. To be held gently in memory without the pressure of presence. 

I used to think this was avoidant. Some kind of emotional cowardice. That if I really loved these people, I'd do the work to keep them. That letting them drift into theory was the same as not caring. 

But I don't think that's true anymore. I think it takes a different kind of love to let someone stay in the past. To resist the urge to drag them into your present just because you miss the idea of them. To let them be perfect and frozen instead of real and disappointing.

1pqa0p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hercuddle_Hub/comments/1pqa0p2/when_confidence_gets_rewritten_as_a_problem/,When Confidence Gets Rewritten as a Problem,"Tate McRae mentioned in a Rolling Stone :  
“People always want girls to put themselves out there. And the second they do, they get ripped apart for it.”

  
When I read that, my first reaction was not resonance but a physical sense of familiarity.  
I had sent my boyfriend a few photos of casual outfits I was considering buying last week, along with one dress I might wear to a New Year’s party. He replied, “You’re very beautiful, but I think most of the time you dress too revealing, too sexy. You’d be just as beautiful if you wore more clothes.”  
What?

  
At the time, I didn’t react strongly, but I couldn’t help wondering whether this was a warning sign of controlling behavior.  
I bought the New Year’s dress anyway and plan to wear it tonight. He doesn’t drink and doesn’t attend large parties, so he won’t be there.  
About 60 percent of the time, I wear leggings and a sports bra for running, lifting, yoga, walking the dog, or errands, with a sweater if needed. The rest of the time, for coffee or daytime wandering, I dress more like this or this.  
I might show a bit of skin, like my midriff, but I don’t believe my clothing is more revealing than other women’s, or that there is anything performative or attention seeking about it.  
The most ironic part is that his words were almost never malicious. They sounded like advice, like experience, like something said “for my own good.”  
But every sentence subtly reframed something that belonged to me into a problem that needed to be managed.  
Later, I realized that the discomfort I felt was not me being overly sensitive.

  
Just as Tate said, when women first feel sexual and confident, the world rarely asks how that feels. Instead, it immediately starts asking whether it is appropriate.

  
What broke me in that moment was not being judged, but realizing that all the effort, thought, and self affirmation I had put into myself were reduced, in someone else’s narrative, to a single question: was she trying to be looked at?",2,1766112757.0,Hercuddle_Hub,0,1.0,False

For those who dont know its a learning disability and the only reason I can spell it is cause of my phone. Basically it means numbers and words go in one side but fall out the other. Learning things is a marathon and you have to do it consistently or itll jist go away. Did you know that age i think 25 or 30 all the stuff you've managed to retain will stay to leave you and you'll regress? Kinda shit huh.

I’m heading to Thailand for a 10-day solo trip and wanted to share my plan to see if it sounds reasonable and get some food or activity suggestions. My total budget for the whole 10 days (excluding flights) is around $500–$800 USD. I’m aiming for a mid-range style trip, comfortable stays, local food, and a few paid activities here and there.

I’ll be spending 4 days in Chiang Mai and 4 days in Bangkok. For Chiang Mai, I’ve already researched a few temples, some night markets, and I’m excited to try khao soi. I’m also planning to do one activity, maybe a cooking class or a simple nature trip, but I haven’t decided which yet.

For Bangkok, I’m mostly interested in street food, nice coffee spots, and neighborhoods that are easy to explore alone. I’ve already read up on the main tourist attractions, so I’m more curious about specific dishes, small food places, or low-key experiences you personally enjoyed.

If you’ve done something similar, I’d love to hear your food recommendations, activities, and suggestions on where I should go that fit this plan.

1pq9vrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pq9vrz/peopco/,PEOPCO,"First time poster here. I don't have much time, I need to get this out there. I don't know where to start, I'm scared to keep all this inside, but I'm terrified to relive it. Please, bare with me. I will not be sharing my real name, and don't even bother trying to email me, it's a disposable email. As soon as this is posted I will cease to exist again.



I've been running for months now, trying to stay one step ahead. It's true what they said. It was all fucking true. I see flashes of it in my mind. Short sentences that didn't make one ounce of sense at first. I see it when I try to sleep.... ""SEE SOON"", and ""WE COME YOU DONT CHOOSE"". FUCK! I'm going crazy just thinking about it! Ok, I'm going to calm myself down, and I am going to tell you my story, from the start, in every detail I can remember. Here goes………



It was just coming into Winter when this all began. I remember because the night it began I was enjoying a nice warm caramel latte. It started off seemingly harmless. I should probably mention, I am male. That is the only personal information I will be sharing. I'm not exactly popular, so I was intrigued when the facebook friend requests started coming through. I didn't know what to think of these people. They all had strange, weird names about different animals and things like that. I don't really remember the specifics, too much has happened since then. I do remember one about a chicken, I think?



Anyway. So here's where the foundation of this story comes into play. Scrolling down the list of requests I see one that stands out. I was instantly creeped out when I saw it. The picture itself was ridiculous, a disgusting looking 40 something year old, stretching his mouth with his hands to totally unnatural proportions. His head was bald, his face was pale and his eyes..... there was something about those eyes..... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. His name? Possibly the weirdest factor here, his name was Jack Smile. Strange huh? But that wasn't what creeped me out. There was something about looking at this guy that gave me a bad vibe. Sitting there, I was overcome with this feeling that SOMETHING was wrong. I shook it off, probably my mind running in overdrive I thought. I didn't accept the request, but I didn't think anything more of it either. I closed my laptop and decided to play some playstation before bed.



Waking up the next morning, I looked at the clock and realized I had overslept BIG TIME. I struggled to get out of bed. I felt like shit, like I had just popped a bunch of valium. I could not keep my eyes open. Deciding I had already wasted enough of the day I forced myself to stand up and go and get some much needed caffeine. On the way out of my room I opened up my laptop ready to jump on and check some emails, catch up on social media, you know the daily norms. But as the laptop screen powered on and revealed the facebook website, I noticed an unusual amount of notifications. As I said I'm not the most popular guy so this was totally out of the ordinary for me. Feeling pretty chuffed with my seemingly newfound popularity, I went and got myself a coffee and came back.

I sat down and hastily clicked the notifications icon. My stomach.... LITERALLY ...... DROPPED. 



Well, not literally, but I understand the saying now. It felt as though my stomach was falling, over and over again. There in front of me were hundreds of notifications, letting me know my posts and photos had been PUBLICLY SHARED. One by one I scrolled down, seeing endless notifications reading ""Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your status, Jack Smile shared your..."" and on and on and on! Feeling beyond creeped at this point, I navigated to this guy's profile. There in front of me were ALL of my posts and photos, dating right back to when I first joined Facebook. Why? I kept asking myself ""why?"". Why was he fucking doing this? Is it someone I know playing a stupid prank? Not wanting anything further to do with this individual, EVER, I swiftly hit the 'block' button.



At this point I think it's important to point out that I am a privacy freak. My Facebook profile is hidden. My I.P is hidden. Everything is locked down. I'm a hermit, not even my best friends know where I live. Important information to keep in mind for the purposes of this story. So anyway, I had him blocked, and I set an alert via a browser extension to sound a bell whenever the words ""Jack Smile"" were identified. Thinking this was the end of it, I carried on checking my emails, and got on with my day.



About a week went by, perhaps longer, I'm a little hazy. Everything was normal. No friend requests, no weird random post shares. I had just about forgotten the whole thing. It was Saturday afternoon, and I was caught up on all of my assessments (I was studying online at this point). It was a nice day outside, and I hate nice days and outside, so I decided to jump on the PS4 and play some battlefield. Partied up with my buddy (we'll call him Simon), and started searching for a match.



We ended up playing for hours, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time. I was just about to tell Simon that I was heading off to grab some dinner when his voice became shaken, then fell silent. I was worried, I shouted for him to answer me for about 2 minutes before I got a response. Still audibly shaken, Simon just managed to get his words out ""D..d.dd....dude..... Someone just messaged me on ..... on PSN...... he knows your fucking name dude....."". I knew instantly. I knew what was happening, my heart began to race and that feeling in my stomach returned and hit me like a tonne of bricks.



I didn't want to know, but I had to ask; ""Who..... who is it man?"". Simon responded with those two words I dreaded to hear, ""Jack.... Smile..... it's someone named Jack Smile"". I felt like crying. Who the fuck was this guy and why was he so hell bent on contacting me?? I had to know, I just had to know... ""Simon..... what the fuck did he say?"". Simon, still shaken, read the message out to me, it read...

""PEOPCO KARL THOMPSON!! DONT BLOCK JACK!!! HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME!!”.



I was in disbelief. A state of utter confusion and panic. Who is this guy? Realizing I had been silent for about 5 minutes straight processing all this, I snapped back to reality remembering Simon was still on party chat, ""are you all good bro?"" I asked him. Simon responded ""Dude.... how the fuck did he know that I knew you?"". I hadn't even considered this until now. Not only does this guy know my name, but he knew I was on PSN, and he KNEW who I was gaming with at that very moment. Looking back now there is absolutely no doubting that he was watching somehow. It's what they fucking do. They watch, they sit and watch as your sanity fritters away.



Anyway, back to the story. I apologize, my mind is all over the place. I said my goodbyes to Simon, and told him that it's probably best that we only speak over the phone from here on out. He agreed, and told me that he would call me tomorrow to check up. I thanked him for that, he was a good friend. I powered off my console and decided to check on facebook before bed, I was seriously contemplating deactivating my profile at this point. I went to the fridge and grabbed myself a cold bud. I fucking needed it. I chugged it back, every last drop before grabbing another one and heading back to my laptop. I opened it up, and would you believe it? Another friend request and a buttload of notifications. I clicked the friend request, hesitantly.



When I saw who it was, I slammed the laptop shut so hard I'm amazed it survived. There was a friend request from Jack. Spelled ""J@ck Smyle"". He knew. He fucking knew! He knew that I had set an alert on my browser, remember I mentioned that?? He MUST have known! Why else would he spell his name that way?! There was no other explanation. This was creepy before, but as far as I was concerned it had just become dangerous. There was no doubt in my mind anymore, whether online or closer than I thought, I was being stalked.



I didn't get one ounce of sleep that night. The sun came up and stung me un-forgivingly through my bedroom window. I felt like trash. My phone had gone flat, so I put it on to charge before heading out into the kitchen to grab a shitty microwave breakfast. I threw it in the microwave, and threw it in the bin as soon as it was done. It smelled worse than I felt. But I digress, returning to my bedroom I checked my now slightly charged phone, 4 missed calls. Fuck. Could it be? I stared at them, they were all from a blocked number. I couldn't even trace it. I jumped as the phone began ringing again.



Blocked number, again. I answered it and sat on the line silently. A voice came through, ""Karl!"". I was shitting bricks. No holding back now, I responded ""I don't know who the fuck you are or what you want, but I will find out and I'll be handing your information to the cops. Back off"". I felt pretty good about that, and the line was quiet for a moment before the voice came over again ""Dude! It's Simon you idiot!"". Dammit, now I felt like a piece of shit, I had totally forgotten he was going to call me. I responded ""I'm so sorry man, I saw the blocked number and thought it must have been that fucking mouth dude"". Simon was understanding of this, ""It's all good bro, I was just callin' to check in, but I have to go now, I love you bro"". And he hung up.



That was weird. Everybody loves their best bro, but no one says it, especially Simon and I. Looking back, if I hadn't been so overtired my mind probably would have been better able to put it all together. Why Simon had called me from a blocked number when he never had before, why he was in such a rush to hang up the phone, and why after all this time he felt the need to tell me he loves me. It wasn't until I caught a glimpse of the patrol car pulling up outside my house, and answered my door to a police officer informing me that my best friend of the past 20 years had gone missing that I pieced it together.



I broke down, I can barely remember that moment. It's all a blur. I do remember one thing though, I just couldn't figure out why the police had come to me, if this is a missing persons case then why weren't they out there searching? And why me? I thought they only contacted direct family? I picked myself up off the ground, turned to the officer and put my questions to him. His response still tears me up inside to this day. He put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes and said, ""Because he mentioned you in his suicide note... I'm so sorry son”.



I don't remember much of the following month. I fell into a deep depression. My life was alcohol and sleep. I was barely eating, I would drink and pass out only to do it all again the next day. They never found Simon's body, and I was so drunk 24/7 I forgot about his funeral. I missed my best friend's fucking funeral. After about a month of this self abuse I was finally able to pick myself up and start getting back to normality. I contacted my course provider and apologized for my absence. I managed to sweet talk my way into beginning my studies again, under normal circumstances I would have been kicked out.



Things were looking positive. But isn't it always the case, just when you think everything will be ok, and the metaphorical sun is shining at its brightest, the dark clouds return. Yeah, you guys guessed it, I opened facebook and there they were, hundreds of notifications, ""Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile..."" and you get the idea. All of a sudden I wasn't scared, I wasn't anxious, I was just fucking angry!



No more, I'm going to talk to this asshole and find out what the fuck he wants. I clicked on his profile and initiated a private message session. I'm going to copy and paste the message session below, I'll tidy it up a little so it reads clearer, but I'm going to leave his responses in tact so that you can get an idea of what I was dealing with here, and what to look out for…



*Me: Ok. Own the fuck up asshole. Who are you and what do you want?*



*seen*



*2 hours later*



*Me: You have seen this message! answer!*



*Jack Smile: HELLO TO KARL THOMPSON HELLO*



*Me: Why the fuck are you doing this? Is this a joke?*



*Jack Smile: NOT JOKE BECAUSE PEOPCO NEED THE PEOPLE*



*Me: What are you talking about???*



*Jack Smile: THIS IS A VERY GOOD THAT YOU ARE TALK TO JACK IF YOU ARENT TALK JACK I HAVE NO WAY TO COME SEE*



*Me: See WHAT?!*



*Jack Smile: NO YOU DONT ASK THAT PEOPCO WE COME TO YOU YOU DONT GET TO CHOOSE*



*Me: Look man, drop it. This is a sick fucking joke and I'm goin to bring the cops into this if you don't get lost.*



*Jack Smile: THIS NOT GOOD WE PEOPCO NEED THE BEAUTIFUL HAPPY PEOPLE BUT NOT ANGRY NOT HOSTILE WE COME GET SOON*



*Me: Fucking explain yourself idiot. Are you saying you are coming to get me?*



*Jack Smile: YES IT IS THAT*



*Me: Ha! good luck finding me asshole.*



*seen*



This was when EVERYTHING turned upside down on me. This is when I realized I was outclassed. 2 minutes later, this asshole, I shit you not, drops a PICTURE OF MY FUCKING HOUSE IN THE CONVERSATION! He followed this up by saying ""PEOPCO SEE SOON"" before immediately deactivating his facebook account within seconds. I screamed when I saw this. I jumped out of my chair and ran around my house closing every window, drawing every curtain and locking every door.



My fight or flight reflex was in full effect and I was ready to kill ANYTHING that came near my house. I don't remember anything after this, I remember my breathing becoming incredibly rapid and short as I shot quick glances around my dark house in every direction, I remember becoming light headed, and I can only assume I then passed out.

  
I remember waking up on the floor the next day to a knock at the door. My head being in scatters I walked to the door and answered it. There was no one there. That's weird, oh well. I then remembered the previous night, it all came back to me in that one moment and I was instantly gripped in fear, my entire body ran ice cold. I slammed the door and locked it. I got straight on the phone to the police. I had to report this. I didn't ever want to find out what the fuck this PEOPCO shit was.



I called it in, and I had to go into the station to file the report. I hated having to leave the house. I was on edge the entire time. My anxiety was killing me. And you know what? After all that the fuckers wouldn't even help me. They said ""There's been no physical contact"" and as far as they could tell it's just some internet troll. I knew better. Feeling defeated, I began the walk home. I lived in a small town, so no big deal. The worst part was knowing that freak could be anywhere. I've never felt so exposed. Walking home, I felt naked, like there were eyes right on me the whole way. Then I noticed it, it was faint, barely audible. And it had been with me the whole time. I assumed it was bugs or.... I don't know.... something. But no, I was mistaken. I looked up above me and there was no mistaking it, there was a fucking drone! A very small one but it was undoubtedly a drone. As soon as I spotted it, it flew away.



I've never made it home so fast in my life. I collapsed on the floor and cried like a bitch for hours. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared to be in my home, I was scared to leave my home. I was scared to engage in the digital world. Even online I could feel those watching eyes on me. I disconnected my wifi, I unplugged my PS4, I shut down my laptop and I took the sim card out of my phone. I wondered to myself just how long he had been watching.



Emotionally and physically spent, I crawled into bed. I laid there for hours, my mind running in overdrive, trying to think of any reasonable explanation for all this. But there wasn't one. I was hearing strange noises. Laying there, I was convinced it was all in my head, that I was being driven to insanity, then suddenly a thought him me, and I physically felt my face turning pale white. The fucking laundry door! How could I be so stupid?! I forgot to lock it the previous night!! I jumped out of bed and ran to my bedroom door, stopping at the last minute. My mind froze as the reality of what was happening ceased my entire body in fear. Laughing. I heard laughing INSIDE THE HOUSE. It was.... ridiculous! It was like a childish, babyish laugh, but clearly coming from a grown man. I heard scratching, and laughing, the laughter became louder and louder and suddenly BAM! I heard a door slam shut.



I sat, pressed up against my now locked bedroom door until morning came. I picked up my collectors edition Yankees bat, and slowly walked outside. I crept down the hall, the slightest noises were causing my heart to stop. I turned and walked into the laundry. What I saw caused my legs to collapse underneath me. I fell onto my knees and stared, incapacitated by fear and disbelief, at three large words carved into the wooden wall... ""PEOPCO SEE SOON”.



He was in my house. He was IN MY FUCKING HOUSE. There was nothing left to do. I had no options left but to hole up in here and either wait this out or die. I called a taxi and got dropped off at the hardware store. I bought the biggest, toughest looking door locks, chains and padlocks I could find. On the way back home I told the cab driver to take me to a bar. I spent the next hour intoxicating myself, before buying a case of bud to go and catching another cab back home. I fortified the shit out of my home, cracked open my case of beer, rested my baseball bat in my lap and waited....... and waited.............. and waited.......... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I began to relax, I plugged the TV back in, opened another beer and kicked back. Perhaps this is just the moment he was waiting for, because it was then that I felt it, a sharp pain, something tiny and sharp being driven into the back of my neck. I was thrown into a small panic, then all of a sudden, before I could even figure out what was going on, I was completely calm. Then it all went black.



The next part of this story is incredibly difficult for me to tell, I apologize if my writing seems sloppy, I apologize if you struggle to understand it. I'm doing my best to stay focused here. In some strange way this is therapeutic, but it's not easy. So, here goes…



The next thing I can remember is waking up. It was hot, like really fucking hot. And I was thirsty. I sat up and began to take in my surroundings. I saw dry mountains, bushland, a wooden fence spanning miles it seemed. Then I remembered, the pain in my neck, someone sedated me. It's the only explanation. This was it, whoever had been following me, they had got to me. I tried to stand up but I couldn't, I was still too weak. I felt like crying, if you think you've felt genuine fear, you haven't. Trust me. I ripped at the chains that bound me for what felt like eternity, I pulled until I was bleeding and then I pulled some more. It wasn't until the sun began to fall that the hopelessness truly sank in. There was nothing I could do. I had no idea who these people were, what they wanted, and there was nothing I could do but wait. I didn't know what they were planning, but you don't chain a person to a tree if you have good intentions for them, I knew that much. The fear was killing me. I was totally awake an conscious at this stage and it was all beginning to sink in, I was probably going to die. It's a strange sensation let me tell you, the fear is brutal, but the certainty of looming death brings a strange sense of calm. So I did what most in my situation would, I laid down and waited. Just waited. What was the point in trying? It was over, I lost. I laid there for hours just going over this whole thing in my head, over and over again.



It was then I heard it. That fucking laughter. That childish laughter I heard in my house that night, but it was coming from a group. Yeah, there were a lot of them. People just like me I wondered? The laughter grew closer, and louder. I closed my eyes and waited. I wondered to myself how they were gonna do it, would they just shoot me? Would they stab me? I kept my eyes closed and waited for the inevitable. Then I heard his voice, I just knew it was him, ""GET UP FROM GROUND!"" he said. It was SO strange, if my situation was not so dire I would have laughed, he was screaming at me, and yet his voice was full of happy tones. I looked up. It was him indeed, it was Jack fucking Smile. Again he said ""GET ON FEET OFF GROUND!"" in that weird angry/happy hybrid voice of his. That in itself was unsettling. I tried to speak but I couldn't. I tried to tell him that I was too weak to stand but I could not talk, my mouth hurt, it hurt really fucking badly. Not surprising, I was sore all over.



He then walked quickly toward me doing that weird laughing thing, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, he had a gigantic smile that stretched over his entire face, he laughed as he pulled me to my feet only for me to collapse again, and the process was repeated over and over. I managed to get out the words ""I cant stand I'm too weak!"". He stopped laughing, and his smile grew, somehow that giant unsettling smile grew larger. He held up his hand and shouted ""HERE YOU OTHER PEOPLE"" which I assumed means ""come here"". Two other men walked over to me. It was then that I noticed the large group standing around me.... and then I noticed their faces. I instantly threw up whatever was left in my stomach. It was disgusting. I looked again to confirm what I had seen and threw up again. Every person here was smiling. No, I don't mean they were happy, I mean they were smiling, permanently.



Their faces, all of them, were full of industrial grade staples, morphing their mouths into a gigantic smile similar to Jack's. I have never, and probably will never witness anything quite as disturbing as this. I glanced around the group. Some of them were visibly crying, sickeningly contrasting the unnatural smiles on their faces. Some of them were still bleeding around where the staples were pushed in. And some of them, perhaps most unsettling of them all, were visibly enjoying themselves. Then I saw him.... in the back, barely recognisable. I broke down into tears as I spotted my best friend. They got Simon. He didn't take his own life, I fucking knew it. I felt like shit... they were after ME, he just got in the way... 



Suddenly I was grabbed by the two men who jack had summoned, and they pulled me to my feet and slammed me up against the tree I was chained to. Jack began laughing once again, as he produced a nail gun from a box beside a nearby tent, ""Please no! NO!"" I begged as he drew nearer, laughing maniacally now. His laughter boomed in my ears and his saliva splattered all over my face as the nails shot through each of my hands, securing me to the tree.



I remember wanting to pass out but I couldn't. Jack then began dancing around and screaming ""I TOLD GET ON FEET I WARNED I WARNED TO STAND UP ON GROUND NOT BE ON GROUND I TOLD GET ON FEET I DID"". Watching him with tears in my eyes, I screamed ""just fucking kill me! fuck you!"". He stopped suddenly, and glanced at his offsiders. He motioned his head toward me and said ""SHOW THAT ONE HAPPY ONE HOW WE ONE NOW US"". I remember this dialogue perfectly. It was so ridiculous, it was utter gibberish yet it made perfect sense. The offsider produced a mirror, held it up and slowly approached me. As it drew closer I realized. That is why I couldn't speak, that's why I was in pain, I cried as I gazed upon my giant, wide stretching smile.



The entire group began laughing in that strange childish laugh. Jack held up his hands after a while of this and said ""BACK IN BUILDING NOW THIS ONE STAY HERE THIS ONE DONT GET TO EAT THE LOVELY FOOD HE STAY HERE AND HE WILL GET TO BE ONE OF PEOPCO SOON BUT NOT YET HE STAY NOW"". So I stood there, face full of staples, nailed to a fucking tree. I stood there for days on end until I finally passed out.



And here we are. In the month between when I arrived to the day I made my escape, I played the part perfectly. I gained their trust, but I did not conform to their ways. I understand how they work now, how they operate. They are called PEOPCO. Pronounced ""PEE-OPP-CO"". They are a society, a cult. They are incredibly well equipped, once I saw what went on inside I was no longer surprised that they were able to track me the way they did. They worship a man named Jack Smile.



Yes, he is just a man, but to his followers he is a God. They believe in a world in which everybody worships Jack, and they truly believe that by taking people one by one, eventually they will spread their message far and wide. This is flawed on so many levels, but it doesn't have to make sense to be dangerous. I have to go now. It was a risk to even connect to the grid long enough to post this. I'll check back again if and when I can. Farewell for now, and allow me to leave you with this final warning…

1pq9vfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pq9vfe/peopco/,PEOPCO,"First time poster here. I don't have much time, I need to get this out there. I don't know where to start, I'm scared to keep all this inside, but I'm terrified to relive it. Please, bare with me. I will not be sharing my real name, and don't even bother trying to email me, it's a disposable email. As soon as this is posted I will cease to exist again.



I've been running for months now, trying to stay one step ahead. It's true what they said. It was all fucking true. I see flashes of it in my mind. Short sentences that didn't make one ounce of sense at first. I see it when I try to sleep.... ""SEE SOON"", and ""WE COME YOU DONT CHOOSE"". FUCK! I'm going crazy just thinking about it! Ok, I'm going to calm myself down, and I am going to tell you my story, from the start, in every detail I can remember. Here goes………



It was just coming into Winter when this all began. I remember because the night it began I was enjoying a nice warm caramel latte. It started off seemingly harmless. I should probably mention, I am male. That is the only personal information I will be sharing. I'm not exactly popular, so I was intrigued when the facebook friend requests started coming through. I didn't know what to think of these people. They all had strange, weird names about different animals and things like that. I don't really remember the specifics, too much has happened since then. I do remember one about a chicken, I think?



Anyway. So here's where the foundation of this story comes into play. Scrolling down the list of requests I see one that stands out. I was instantly creeped out when I saw it. The picture itself was ridiculous, a disgusting looking 40 something year old, stretching his mouth with his hands to totally unnatural proportions. His head was bald, his face was pale and his eyes..... there was something about those eyes..... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. His name? Possibly the weirdest factor here, his name was Jack Smile. Strange huh? But that wasn't what creeped me out. There was something about looking at this guy that gave me a bad vibe. Sitting there, I was overcome with this feeling that SOMETHING was wrong. I shook it off, probably my mind running in overdrive I thought. I didn't accept the request, but I didn't think anything more of it either. I closed my laptop and decided to play some playstation before bed.



Waking up the next morning, I looked at the clock and realized I had overslept BIG TIME. I struggled to get out of bed. I felt like shit, like I had just popped a bunch of valium. I could not keep my eyes open. Deciding I had already wasted enough of the day I forced myself to stand up and go and get some much needed caffeine. On the way out of my room I opened up my laptop ready to jump on and check some emails, catch up on social media, you know the daily norms. But as the laptop screen powered on and revealed the facebook website, I noticed an unusual amount of notifications. As I said I'm not the most popular guy so this was totally out of the ordinary for me. Feeling pretty chuffed with my seemingly newfound popularity, I went and got myself a coffee and came back.

I sat down and hastily clicked the notifications icon. My stomach.... LITERALLY ...... DROPPED. 



Well, not literally, but I understand the saying now. It felt as though my stomach was falling, over and over again. There in front of me were hundreds of notifications, letting me know my posts and photos had been PUBLICLY SHARED. One by one I scrolled down, seeing endless notifications reading ""Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your status, Jack Smile shared your..."" and on and on and on! Feeling beyond creeped at this point, I navigated to this guy's profile. There in front of me were ALL of my posts and photos, dating right back to when I first joined Facebook. Why? I kept asking myself ""why?"". Why was he fucking doing this? Is it someone I know playing a stupid prank? Not wanting anything further to do with this individual, EVER, I swiftly hit the 'block' button.



At this point I think it's important to point out that I am a privacy freak. My Facebook profile is hidden. My I.P is hidden. Everything is locked down. I'm a hermit, not even my best friends know where I live. Important information to keep in mind for the purposes of this story. So anyway, I had him blocked, and I set an alert via a browser extension to sound a bell whenever the words ""Jack Smile"" were identified. Thinking this was the end of it, I carried on checking my emails, and got on with my day.



About a week went by, perhaps longer, I'm a little hazy. Everything was normal. No friend requests, no weird random post shares. I had just about forgotten the whole thing. It was Saturday afternoon, and I was caught up on all of my assessments (I was studying online at this point). It was a nice day outside, and I hate nice days and outside, so I decided to jump on the PS4 and play some battlefield. Partied up with my buddy (we'll call him Simon), and started searching for a match.



We ended up playing for hours, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time. I was just about to tell Simon that I was heading off to grab some dinner when his voice became shaken, then fell silent. I was worried, I shouted for him to answer me for about 2 minutes before I got a response. Still audibly shaken, Simon just managed to get his words out ""D..d.dd....dude..... Someone just messaged me on ..... on PSN...... he knows your fucking name dude....."". I knew instantly. I knew what was happening, my heart began to race and that feeling in my stomach returned and hit me like a tonne of bricks.



I didn't want to know, but I had to ask; ""Who..... who is it man?"". Simon responded with those two words I dreaded to hear, ""Jack.... Smile..... it's someone named Jack Smile"". I felt like crying. Who the fuck was this guy and why was he so hell bent on contacting me?? I had to know, I just had to know... ""Simon..... what the fuck did he say?"". Simon, still shaken, read the message out to me, it read...

""PEOPCO KARL THOMPSON!! DONT BLOCK JACK!!! HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME HE BLOCKED ME!!”.



I was in disbelief. A state of utter confusion and panic. Who is this guy? Realizing I had been silent for about 5 minutes straight processing all this, I snapped back to reality remembering Simon was still on party chat, ""are you all good bro?"" I asked him. Simon responded ""Dude.... how the fuck did he know that I knew you?"". I hadn't even considered this until now. Not only does this guy know my name, but he knew I was on PSN, and he KNEW who I was gaming with at that very moment. Looking back now there is absolutely no doubting that he was watching somehow. It's what they fucking do. They watch, they sit and watch as your sanity fritters away.



Anyway, back to the story. I apologize, my mind is all over the place. I said my goodbyes to Simon, and told him that it's probably best that we only speak over the phone from here on out. He agreed, and told me that he would call me tomorrow to check up. I thanked him for that, he was a good friend. I powered off my console and decided to check on facebook before bed, I was seriously contemplating deactivating my profile at this point. I went to the fridge and grabbed myself a cold bud. I fucking needed it. I chugged it back, every last drop before grabbing another one and heading back to my laptop. I opened it up, and would you believe it? Another friend request and a buttload of notifications. I clicked the friend request, hesitantly.



When I saw who it was, I slammed the laptop shut so hard I'm amazed it survived. There was a friend request from Jack. Spelled ""J@ck Smyle"". He knew. He fucking knew! He knew that I had set an alert on my browser, remember I mentioned that?? He MUST have known! Why else would he spell his name that way?! There was no other explanation. This was creepy before, but as far as I was concerned it had just become dangerous. There was no doubt in my mind anymore, whether online or closer than I thought, I was being stalked.



I didn't get one ounce of sleep that night. The sun came up and stung me un-forgivingly through my bedroom window. I felt like trash. My phone had gone flat, so I put it on to charge before heading out into the kitchen to grab a shitty microwave breakfast. I threw it in the microwave, and threw it in the bin as soon as it was done. It smelled worse than I felt. But I digress, returning to my bedroom I checked my now slightly charged phone, 4 missed calls. Fuck. Could it be? I stared at them, they were all from a blocked number. I couldn't even trace it. I jumped as the phone began ringing again.



Blocked number, again. I answered it and sat on the line silently. A voice came through, ""Karl!"". I was shitting bricks. No holding back now, I responded ""I don't know who the fuck you are or what you want, but I will find out and I'll be handing your information to the cops. Back off"". I felt pretty good about that, and the line was quiet for a moment before the voice came over again ""Dude! It's Simon you idiot!"". Dammit, now I felt like a piece of shit, I had totally forgotten he was going to call me. I responded ""I'm so sorry man, I saw the blocked number and thought it must have been that fucking mouth dude"". Simon was understanding of this, ""It's all good bro, I was just callin' to check in, but I have to go now, I love you bro"". And he hung up.



That was weird. Everybody loves their best bro, but no one says it, especially Simon and I. Looking back, if I hadn't been so overtired my mind probably would have been better able to put it all together. Why Simon had called me from a blocked number when he never had before, why he was in such a rush to hang up the phone, and why after all this time he felt the need to tell me he loves me. It wasn't until I caught a glimpse of the patrol car pulling up outside my house, and answered my door to a police officer informing me that my best friend of the past 20 years had gone missing that I pieced it together.



I broke down, I can barely remember that moment. It's all a blur. I do remember one thing though, I just couldn't figure out why the police had come to me, if this is a missing persons case then why weren't they out there searching? And why me? I thought they only contacted direct family? I picked myself up off the ground, turned to the officer and put my questions to him. His response still tears me up inside to this day. He put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes and said, ""Because he mentioned you in his suicide note... I'm so sorry son”.



I don't remember much of the following month. I fell into a deep depression. My life was alcohol and sleep. I was barely eating, I would drink and pass out only to do it all again the next day. They never found Simon's body, and I was so drunk 24/7 I forgot about his funeral. I missed my best friend's fucking funeral. After about a month of this self abuse I was finally able to pick myself up and start getting back to normality. I contacted my course provider and apologized for my absence. I managed to sweet talk my way into beginning my studies again, under normal circumstances I would have been kicked out.



Things were looking positive. But isn't it always the case, just when you think everything will be ok, and the metaphorical sun is shining at its brightest, the dark clouds return. Yeah, you guys guessed it, I opened facebook and there they were, hundreds of notifications, ""Jack Smile shared your post, Jack Smile shared your photo, Jack Smile..."" and you get the idea. All of a sudden I wasn't scared, I wasn't anxious, I was just fucking angry!



No more, I'm going to talk to this asshole and find out what the fuck he wants. I clicked on his profile and initiated a private message session. I'm going to copy and paste the message session below, I'll tidy it up a little so it reads clearer, but I'm going to leave his responses in tact so that you can get an idea of what I was dealing with here, and what to look out for…

This was when EVERYTHING turned upside down on me. This is when I realized I was outclassed. 2 minutes later, this asshole, I shit you not, drops a PICTURE OF MY FUCKING HOUSE IN THE CONVERSATION! He followed this up by saying ""PEOPCO SEE SOON"" before immediately deactivating his facebook account within seconds. I screamed when I saw this. I jumped out of my chair and ran around my house closing every window, drawing every curtain and locking every door.



My fight or flight reflex was in full effect and I was ready to kill ANYTHING that came near my house. I don't remember anything after this, I remember my breathing becoming incredibly rapid and short as I shot quick glances around my dark house in every direction, I remember becoming light headed, and I can only assume I then passed out.

  
I remember waking up on the floor the next day to a knock at the door. My head being in scatters I walked to the door and answered it. There was no one there. That's weird, oh well. I then remembered the previous night, it all came back to me in that one moment and I was instantly gripped in fear, my entire body ran ice cold. I slammed the door and locked it. I got straight on the phone to the police. I had to report this. I didn't ever want to find out what the fuck this PEOPCO shit was.



I called it in, and I had to go into the station to file the report. I hated having to leave the house. I was on edge the entire time. My anxiety was killing me. And you know what? After all that the fuckers wouldn't even help me. They said ""There's been no physical contact"" and as far as they could tell it's just some internet troll. I knew better. Feeling defeated, I began the walk home. I lived in a small town, so no big deal. The worst part was knowing that freak could be anywhere. I've never felt so exposed. Walking home, I felt naked, like there were eyes right on me the whole way. Then I noticed it, it was faint, barely audible. And it had been with me the whole time. I assumed it was bugs or.... I don't know.... something. But no, I was mistaken. I looked up above me and there was no mistaking it, there was a fucking drone! A very small one but it was undoubtedly a drone. As soon as I spotted it, it flew away.



I've never made it home so fast in my life. I collapsed on the floor and cried like a bitch for hours. I didn't know what else to do. I was scared to be in my home, I was scared to leave my home. I was scared to engage in the digital world. Even online I could feel those watching eyes on me. I disconnected my wifi, I unplugged my PS4, I shut down my laptop and I took the sim card out of my phone. I wondered to myself just how long he had been watching.



Emotionally and physically spent, I crawled into bed. I laid there for hours, my mind running in overdrive, trying to think of any reasonable explanation for all this. But there wasn't one. I was hearing strange noises. Laying there, I was convinced it was all in my head, that I was being driven to insanity, then suddenly a thought him me, and I physically felt my face turning pale white. The fucking laundry door! How could I be so stupid?! I forgot to lock it the previous night!! I jumped out of bed and ran to my bedroom door, stopping at the last minute. My mind froze as the reality of what was happening ceased my entire body in fear. Laughing. I heard laughing INSIDE THE HOUSE. It was.... ridiculous! It was like a childish, babyish laugh, but clearly coming from a grown man. I heard scratching, and laughing, the laughter became louder and louder and suddenly BAM! I heard a door slam shut.



I sat, pressed up against my now locked bedroom door until morning came. I picked up my collectors edition Yankees bat, and slowly walked outside. I crept down the hall, the slightest noises were causing my heart to stop. I turned and walked into the laundry. What I saw caused my legs to collapse underneath me. I fell onto my knees and stared, incapacitated by fear and disbelief, at three large words carved into the wooden wall... ""PEOPCO SEE SOON”.



He was in my house. He was IN MY FUCKING HOUSE. There was nothing left to do. I had no options left but to hole up in here and either wait this out or die. I called a taxi and got dropped off at the hardware store. I bought the biggest, toughest looking door locks, chains and padlocks I could find. On the way back home I told the cab driver to take me to a bar. I spent the next hour intoxicating myself, before buying a case of bud to go and catching another cab back home. I fortified the shit out of my home, cracked open my case of beer, rested my baseball bat in my lap and waited....... and waited.............. and waited.......... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I began to relax, I plugged the TV back in, opened another beer and kicked back. Perhaps this is just the moment he was waiting for, because it was then that I felt it, a sharp pain, something tiny and sharp being driven into the back of my neck. I was thrown into a small panic, then all of a sudden, before I could even figure out what was going on, I was completely calm. Then it all went black.



The next part of this story is incredibly difficult for me to tell, I apologize if my writing seems sloppy, I apologize if you struggle to understand it. I'm doing my best to stay focused here. In some strange way this is therapeutic, but it's not easy. So, here goes…



The next thing I can remember is waking up. It was hot, like really fucking hot. And I was thirsty. I sat up and began to take in my surroundings. I saw dry mountains, bushland, a wooden fence spanning miles it seemed. Then I remembered, the pain in my neck, someone sedated me. It's the only explanation. This was it, whoever had been following me, they had got to me. I tried to stand up but I couldn't, I was still too weak. I felt like crying, if you think you've felt genuine fear, you haven't. Trust me. I ripped at the chains that bound me for what felt like eternity, I pulled until I was bleeding and then I pulled some more. It wasn't until the sun began to fall that the hopelessness truly sank in. There was nothing I could do. I had no idea who these people were, what they wanted, and there was nothing I could do but wait. I didn't know what they were planning, but you don't chain a person to a tree if you have good intentions for them, I knew that much. The fear was killing me. I was totally awake an conscious at this stage and it was all beginning to sink in, I was probably going to die. It's a strange sensation let me tell you, the fear is brutal, but the certainty of looming death brings a strange sense of calm. So I did what most in my situation would, I laid down and waited. Just waited. What was the point in trying? It was over, I lost. I laid there for hours just going over this whole thing in my head, over and over again.



It was then I heard it. That fucking laughter. That childish laughter I heard in my house that night, but it was coming from a group. Yeah, there were a lot of them. People just like me I wondered? The laughter grew closer, and louder. I closed my eyes and waited. I wondered to myself how they were gonna do it, would they just shoot me? Would they stab me? I kept my eyes closed and waited for the inevitable. Then I heard his voice, I just knew it was him, ""GET UP FROM GROUND!"" he said. It was SO strange, if my situation was not so dire I would have laughed, he was screaming at me, and yet his voice was full of happy tones. I looked up. It was him indeed, it was Jack fucking Smile. Again he said ""GET ON FEET OFF GROUND!"" in that weird angry/happy hybrid voice of his. That in itself was unsettling. I tried to speak but I couldn't. I tried to tell him that I was too weak to stand but I could not talk, my mouth hurt, it hurt really fucking badly. Not surprising, I was sore all over.



He then walked quickly toward me doing that weird laughing thing, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, he had a gigantic smile that stretched over his entire face, he laughed as he pulled me to my feet only for me to collapse again, and the process was repeated over and over. I managed to get out the words ""I cant stand I'm too weak!"". He stopped laughing, and his smile grew, somehow that giant unsettling smile grew larger. He held up his hand and shouted ""HERE YOU OTHER PEOPLE"" which I assumed means ""come here"". Two other men walked over to me. It was then that I noticed the large group standing around me.... and then I noticed their faces. I instantly threw up whatever was left in my stomach. It was disgusting. I looked again to confirm what I had seen and threw up again. Every person here was smiling. No, I don't mean they were happy, I mean they were smiling, permanently.



Their faces, all of them, were full of industrial grade staples, morphing their mouths into a gigantic smile similar to Jack's. I have never, and probably will never witness anything quite as disturbing as this. I glanced around the group. Some of them were visibly crying, sickeningly contrasting the unnatural smiles on their faces. Some of them were still bleeding around where the staples were pushed in. And some of them, perhaps most unsettling of them all, were visibly enjoying themselves. Then I saw him.... in the back, barely recognisable. I broke down into tears as I spotted my best friend. They got Simon. He didn't take his own life, I fucking knew it. I felt like shit... they were after ME, he just got in the way... 



Suddenly I was grabbed by the two men who jack had summoned, and they pulled me to my feet and slammed me up against the tree I was chained to. Jack began laughing once again, as he produced a nail gun from a box beside a nearby tent, ""Please no! NO!"" I begged as he drew nearer, laughing maniacally now. His laughter boomed in my ears and his saliva splattered all over my face as the nails shot through each of my hands, securing me to the tree.



I remember wanting to pass out but I couldn't. Jack then began dancing around and screaming ""I TOLD GET ON FEET I WARNED I WARNED TO STAND UP ON GROUND NOT BE ON GROUND I TOLD GET ON FEET I DID"". Watching him with tears in my eyes, I screamed ""just fucking kill me! fuck you!"". He stopped suddenly, and glanced at his offsiders. He motioned his head toward me and said ""SHOW THAT ONE HAPPY ONE HOW WE ONE NOW US"". I remember this dialogue perfectly. It was so ridiculous, it was utter gibberish yet it made perfect sense. The offsider produced a mirror, held it up and slowly approached me. As it drew closer I realized. That is why I couldn't speak, that's why I was in pain, I cried as I gazed upon my giant, wide stretching smile.



The entire group began laughing in that strange childish laugh. Jack held up his hands after a while of this and said ""BACK IN BUILDING NOW THIS ONE STAY HERE THIS ONE DONT GET TO EAT THE LOVELY FOOD HE STAY HERE AND HE WILL GET TO BE ONE OF PEOPCO SOON BUT NOT YET HE STAY NOW"". So I stood there, face full of staples, nailed to a fucking tree. I stood there for days on end until I finally passed out.



And here we are. In the month between when I arrived to the day I made my escape, I played the part perfectly. I gained their trust, but I did not conform to their ways. I understand how they work now, how they operate. They are called PEOPCO. Pronounced ""PEE-OPP-CO"". They are a society, a cult. They are incredibly well equipped, once I saw what went on inside I was no longer surprised that they were able to track me the way they did. They worship a man named Jack Smile.



Yes, he is just a man, but to his followers he is a God. They believe in a world in which everybody worships Jack, and they truly believe that by taking people one by one, eventually they will spread their message far and wide. This is flawed on so many levels, but it doesn't have to make sense to be dangerous. I have to go now. It was a risk to even connect to the grid long enough to post this. I'll check back again if and when I can. Farewell for now, and allow me to leave you with this final warning…

1pq9v72,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pq9v72/why_people_pleasing_will_ruin_your_relationships/,Why people pleasing will ruin your relationships (I learned this the hard way),"I used to say yes to everything. Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.",6,1766112316.0,LockedInMan,2,1.0,False

Why is it the second someone gets near the menu, they can't read? The amount of times i've been asked 'oh, whats in this?' and i have to say 'IDK', take the menu they are looking at, and read off of it? You are literally looking at the information, you have more than i do! Use your eyes, please!

Because it is a cafe, we have those table numbers on stalks; the amount of times i will *clearly* put one in front of them and they just leave it behind?! Like bitch, its not for you, its for me so i send shit to the right table! It is in fact not decorative!

On that note; if im bringing food to the table, i dont need you to confirm that this is the right table unless there is only one of you; i am asking who it is for. And then everyone seems to have forgotten who had what; 2 days ago i had a party of 4, 3 of them were burgers, 1 pasta. WHen i delivered them, they didnt seem to know who they were for, i had to just ask them who got something other than a burger. ""oh, me!"" *I will throttle all of you.*

And the amount of people who look at the drinks menu; it is a cafe. It is the same coffee list as every other cafe aside from the Korean tea, why are you looking to see if we sell mochas?

And yes, we have the four standard milk alternatives. I have never had someone asking for an alternative milk ask for something like macadamia, it is always either soy or coconut; *It is a cafe in the 21st century Becky, of course we have fucking soy milk.*

Oh, and put the fucking menus back in their stand, otherwise i have to walk all the way around the bench and put them back myself; it is two feet to the right goddammit.

1pq9sj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Handspinning/comments/1pq9sj9/spinning_for_a_project_that_uses_unspun_yarn/,Spinning for a project that uses unspun yarn?,"I was spinning up this lovely braid of targhee and realized it would look great with something else in my stash (some BFL), then found a project to use both of them in- the [Velvet Moss Vest](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/velvet-moss-vest). I'm planning on using the targhee as the contrast color and the BFL as the main color. The targhee is already spun up as a woolen-spun three-ply (not yet wet finished), the BFL is not yet spun. For the pattern, the main color is an unspun yarn held double with a mohair strand. I realized that I don't know where to get started.

It makes sense to spin the BFL woolen, but beyond that? I've heard that unspun yarns can vary wildly in gauge based on how you're using it. I think I want to do a 2-ply for color management, but I can't tell how tightly or loosely I should spin. Or how thick (WPI) to make the single. Or how much it will bloom during finishing. Or if doing woolen drafting from combed top will be fluffy enough. I've never knitted with an unspun yarn, and I've never spun something so loose, so I don't really have a reference point. Especially since it's held double with mohair in the pattern, which I'm not planning on doing. The pattern says that the two together are roughly DK equivalent, but I have no idea how to spin an equivalent texture. So I want the yarn to be lofty and light, but also not overshadow the contrast color. I was thinking of doing it on my wheel with the 6:1 ratio whorl, to get \~6 twists per inch with a \~30 degree twist angle, but I can't tell if that's the right instinct.

So how would you personally go about spinning for the project if you were making it? I know the usual answer is ""sample, sample, sample"", but I don't have a lot in my stash and I might barely have enough to make the project. I would like to have some sense of direction to minimize the amount of sampling, if possible.

[The targhee is on the left \(Coffee & Contemplation from Into the Whirled\) and the BFL is on the right \(Haunted from Hipstrings\) \(there is wine-purple tucked away in there also\)](https://preview.redd.it/jdfozrr4l28g1.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa98ceaac75560b5e29bae4e78d71d4a6f73a4d)

I'm also planning on using a skein of Cascade BFL in a red-purple color to use for the ribbing, because I doubt I'm getting 600 yards out of 4 oz, unless I do a single. Which I'm not sure would be right for the blotches of color. (Let me know if I'm wrong!)",2,1766112101.0,Handspinning,1,1.0,False

First and foremost, the charlie brown christmas concert with Darling was lovely. As always I was a little sour at being forced out of my hermit hole but once I was out with them, I quickly got into the spirit of things. The concert itself was lovely. A simple three person band - cello, piano, & drums - and they played so quaintly and beautifully. They also had a little choir of children that were also wonderful. I think Darling had an even better time than I did. I was also nice just catching up with them before and after the show. Another sweet surprise, we ran into an old classmate who was also attending the show. It had been so long I didn't even recognize her at first and she was somehow even sweeter than I remembered. Darling was always closer to her than I was but still, I recall being very fond of her back in the day. It was wonderful to see her well and happy.

Now, I am back at home, unsure if I should relax. I got some writing done last night, 570 words. I was busy doing the garbage in-between writing so I only wrote dialogue and left space in the middle to inject descriptions when I write next. I don't know if tonight is going to be when I write next. As you'd expect of me, I was up late again last night and so I am even more tired than I'd normally be after going out. I also won't go into it much, mostly because I have spent all day and night ranting about it off and on in my head, but Mother was a little drunk and a little rude that night. She had the audacity to complain about the gifts under the tree. Too many, she said. She's always been the type to complain about lobster being to buttery and pillows being too soft so to speak, especially after one or many sips. I swear though, she has no right to rant to me about how we're always giving her useless junks after so many birthdays and christmas' getting her things I know for a fact she liked because she is still using it to this day. It seems being perpetually disappointed by horrible family is too ingrained in her sense of self to let a little thing like reality take that away from her. I am trying not to take it too personally given she was a little tipsy at the time. Still, you can understand after how much effort father and I have put getting her gifts why I went to bed steaming.

Anyway, I didn't get any writing done today. I was busy finishing Darling's card and doing so fixes in my room and office. The blinds in my rom fell down months ago and the blinds in my office were on their way to joining them. My parents helped me fix everything up. Hopefully it all holds this time. Now, I get to decide if I want to end the night by writing. It isn't too late yet; not even 10 p.m. But am I willing to put the work in right now? I haven't decided yet. Let me finish my coffee first and we'll find out.

Trying to order a coffee just sounds like “Je vais prendre… um… un … c- …” for 30 seconds in an Anglo accent. Sometimes I used a canned “j’ai un bégaiement et mon français est pas parfait, merci d’être patient” obviously stuttering through that too which feels like overkill for a short interaction. 

I’ve been living in Quebec for three years and have been learning French for about 5 years. I’d say I’m a solid B2 edging on C1. I work as a software developer and speak French at my job almost 100% of the time. My coworkers just live with the fact that I’m FSL and have a speech disability. Outside of that I mostly use English for minimal friction (not turning what should be a 5 second thing into a 1 minute embarrassment for both parties), and feeling  demoralized that after 5 years most strangers think I’m A1 level. I’d like to hear from anyone else that’s in a similar boat. ",53,1766111446.0,montreal,13,0.9,False

This description is from the Tanat bean by way of Sigma Coffee UK:

**Apricot. Strawberry. Cherry.**  
A velvety apricot base meets the sweet freshness of strawberry, lifted by a touch of tart cherry. Rounded yet bright – a cup that balances indulgence with clarity.

**Nestor Lasso**  
From Pitalito, Huila, Nestor Lasso leads El Diviso with a vision for the future of Colombian coffee. Alongside his brother Adrian and partner Jhoan Vergara (Finca Las Flores), he represents a new wave of growers who blend deep-rooted tradition with bold innovation.

Working with rare varieties such as Sidra, Geisha, Pink Bourbon and Java, the team applies precise experimental methods – anaerobic fermentation, thermal washing, extended maceration, and slow drying. The outcome: coffees that are layered, expressive, and often explosive in their complexity.

Through relentless attention to detail and a commitment to sustainability, Nestor Lasso has positioned himself among Colombia’s most exciting producers – where expertise meets sensory excellence.

Notes: Apricot, Strawberry, Cherry
