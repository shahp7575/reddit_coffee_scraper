Every morning at 3:33 AM, they gather in my basement.

I’ve been living in grandmother’s house for six months now, ever since the funeral. Ever since the lawyers handed me keys to a place I’d visited maybe three times as a kid. Ever since I lost my job, my apartment, and what little family I had left to a year that seemed determined to strip everything away.

The house sits on Maple Street in one of those neighborhoods where everyone knows everyone, where casseroles appear on doorsteps when someone dies, where people still leave their doors unlocked. At least, that’s what I thought.

*Step, step, step.* The sound of feet on my basement stairs.

It started the first week. I’d lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, when I’d hear the unmistakable creak of the basement door opening. Then footsteps—careful, deliberate, multiple sets—descending into the space below. At first I convinced myself it was settling. Old houses make noise, especially in winter. The heating system groans, the wood contracts, pipes tick their metallic lullabies.

But houses don’t whisper.

*Come now, come now, come.*

I’d grab the baseball bat grandmother kept beside her bed and creep down the hallway, heart hammering against my ribs. But every time I checked, the basement door was locked. The deadbolt I’d installed myself was turned tight. The stairs beyond lay empty in the moonlight filtering through the high windows.

Still, the whispers continued. Muffled voices rising through the floorboards like steam from some underground prayer meeting. I’d press my ear to the hardwood and catch fragments—words that sounded like confessions, like testimonies, like the kind of sharing that happens in church basements and community centers when people gather to heal.

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

The neighbors were strange about it when I asked. Mrs. Patterson next door would get this look when I mentioned the sounds—not confusion, but something else. Something careful. “Your grandmother,” she’d say, “she helped a lot of people. Had a gift for it. Made space for folks who needed… support.”

“What kind of support?”

“The kind you can’t get during regular hours.”

Mr. Hendricks from across the street was more direct. “Some things don’t stop just because the sun comes up, son. Pain doesn’t punch a time clock. Grief doesn’t respect visiting hours.” He’d glanced at my grandmother’s house with something that looked almost like reverence. “She understood that.”

*Step, step, step.* Always the same rhythm.

I started staying awake, waiting. Three weeks in, I finally worked up the courage to hide in the closet under the stairs at 3:30 AM, where I could see the basement door through the slats. At 3:33 exactly, the deadbolt turned by itself. The door swung open on hinges that never made a sound when I used them, but whispered like wind through leaves when they opened.

They came through my kitchen door first. I heard the soft snick of the lock turning, saw flashlight beams dance across the walls. But it wasn’t the hard white light of intruders—it was warm, golden, the kind that doesn’t hurt tired eyes.

Seven people. Different ages, different backgrounds, but all carrying something that weighed heavy on their shoulders. A woman in scrubs who moved like she’d worked a double shift. A man with paint-stained fingers and hollow cheeks. A teenager whose backpack looked like it held everything she owned. An elderly gentleman using a walker, each step careful and measured.

*Ring, ring, ring.* The soft chime of something metallic.

They descended my basement stairs like they’d done it a thousand times before. Like this was their space, their sanctuary, their cathedral made of concrete and shadows. I waited until I couldn’t hear their footsteps anymore, then crept to the basement door.

The stairs had changed.

Not physically—the wood was still scarred where grandmother had dragged her Christmas boxes up and down for decades. The handrail still wobbled at the third step. But something felt different. Warmer. Like the space below had been transformed by intention, by ritual, by the simple act of people gathering with purpose.

*Come now, come now, come.*

I descended into my own basement and found it full of light.

They’d strung small electric candles from the ceiling joists—the kind churches use during evening services, the kind that won’t burn down a building but still cast everything in gold. Folding chairs arranged in a circle. A coffee pot plugged into the outlet by the water heater, the smell of fresh brew mixing with the scent of vanilla and lavender from candles placed on upturned crates.

The walls were covered in photographs.

Hundreds of them. Polaroids and phone prints and formal portraits, all showing faces at different stages of something—grief, recovery, transformation. Some were before and after shots. Others captured moments of breakthrough, of connection, of healing caught in the act. In the center of the largest wall, a photo of my grandmother surrounded by dozens of people, all of them holding small silver bells.

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

“She saved my life,” said a voice behind me.

I spun around to find the woman in scrubs, her face kind but tired in a way that spoke of years spent caring for others. “Three years ago, I was working ICU during the worst of the pandemic. Lost more patients in six months than I had in the previous ten years combined. Started drinking to sleep, then drinking to wake up, then drinking to exist.”

She gestured to the photos on the wall. “Found out about the meetings through my neighbor. Thought it was some kind of cult at first—who meets at 3:33 AM? But Margaret explained it was the only time that worked for everyone. Night shift workers, insomniacs, people whose pain doesn’t respect business hours. People who needed a place to gather when the rest of the world was asleep.”

*Step, step, step.* More feet on the stairs.

The others joined us—the painter with his hollow cheeks, the teenager with her overstuffed backpack, the elderly man with his walker. Each took their place in the circle of chairs like they were returning home after a long journey.

“I lost my son,” said the painter, his voice steady but soft. “Car accident. Couldn’t paint for two years. Couldn’t see color anymore, couldn’t see the point. Margaret found me on the bridge at 3 AM one night, not quite ready to jump but not quite ready to climb down either.”

The teenager spoke next. “My parents kicked me out when I came out. Been living in shelters and friends’ couches for eight months. Someone at the youth center told me about the meetings. Said there were people here who understood what it meant to lose family.”

The elderly man adjusted his walker and smiled. “Lost my wife of fifty-seven years last spring. Haven’t slept through the night since. Doctor wants to give me pills, but pills don’t cure loneliness. These folks do.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* The soft chime again.

Each person held a small silver bell—the kind used in meditation, in prayer, in moments of remembering. “We ring them for the people we’ve lost,” the nurse explained. “For the parts of ourselves we’ve had to let go. For the hope we’re trying to find again.”

“But why here?” I asked. “Why my grandmother’s basement?”

“Because she understood,” said a new voice.

I turned to see a woman about my mother’s age descending the stairs, carrying a thermos and a bag of what smelled like homemade cookies. “Margaret lost her husband when your mom was just ten. Raised her alone while working two jobs and fighting her own battles with depression. She knew what it meant to feel invisible, to struggle when everyone else was asleep.”

She began setting up supplies—tissues, notebooks, more of those small electric candles. “She started the meetings twenty years ago. Just her and Mrs. Patterson, talking through their grief over coffee at her kitchen table. Word spread quietly, the way these things do. People who needed help finding people who could give it.”

*Come now, come now, come.*

“The time is specific,” the painter continued. “3:33. Sacred numbers in some traditions, but for us it just meant the deep night, when defenses are down and truth comes easier. When the world is quiet enough to hear each other, really hear.”

They began to sit, and something in their posture invited me to join them. I took a chair between the nurse and the teenager, my hands shaking slightly as I accepted the small silver bell someone pressed into my palm.

“We start with the bells,” the elderly man explained. “Three rings for what we’ve lost. Then we share—whatever needs sharing. No judgment, no advice unless it’s asked for, no rushing toward solutions. Just witness.”

*Ring, ring, ring.*

The sound filled the basement, each bell adding its voice to a chorus that seemed to transform the concrete walls into something sacred. I thought of my grandmother, of the job I’d lost, of sitting alone in this house for months feeling like I was disappearing.

“I inherited this house,” I heard myself saying, “but I don’t know how to live in it. Don’t know how to live anywhere, really. Everything fell apart this year and I can’t figure out how to put it back together.”

Nods around the circle. No one tried to fix me or offer platitudes. They just listened as I talked about loneliness, about feeling like I was failing at being human, about lying awake at 3 AM wondering if anyone would notice if I just stopped trying.

“The insomnia’s the worst part,” I said. “It’s like the darkness amplifies everything wrong.”

“That’s why we meet in it,” said the woman with the cookies. “To prove the darkness isn’t empty. To show it can hold community just as easily as despair.”

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

One by one, they shared their stories. The nurse talked about learning to see death as transition rather than failure. The painter described the first time he’d been able to see color again—how it happened gradually, like dawn breaking, and how the meetings had been his lighthouse through the dark hours.

The teenager spoke about chosen family, about how the meetings had taught her that love doesn’t always come from the people who share your DNA. The elderly man talked about his wife, but also about discovering that grief and gratitude could coexist, that missing someone could become a form of loving them.

*Step, step, step.* The rhythm of healing.

“Your grandmother,” said the woman with the cookies, “she had a theory about 3:33 AM. Said it was the hour when the veil between struggling and healing was thinnest. When people were most ready to be honest about what they needed.”

She pulled out a photo—grandmother surrounded by what must have been fifty people, all holding their bells, all with expressions of peace I’d never seen in daylight gatherings. “She called it the Hour of Sacred Insomnia. Time set aside for people whose healing couldn’t wait for business hours.”

The meetings, I learned, had been happening in this basement for two decades. Rotating leadership, evolving membership, but always the same purpose: creating space for people to not be okay in the company of others who understood.

*Ring, ring, ring.* For what we’ve lost.

“But also,” said the nurse, raising her bell again, “for what we’ve found.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* For what we’ve gained.

The painter joined in. “For the strength we discovered we had.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* For unexpected resilience.

The teenager: “For chosen family.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* For love that appears in darkness.

The elderly man: “For the privilege of having had something worth grieving.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* For depth of connection.

“For this basement,” I said, surprising myself, “and for inheriting more than I knew.”

*Ring, ring, ring.* For sacred inheritance.

They stayed until nearly dawn, these night-shift healers, these sacred insomniacs. As they prepared to leave, each person hugged me—not the perfunctory embraces of social obligation, but the full-body connections of people who’d shared truth in the dark.

“Next week?” asked the nurse.

“I’ll put on the coffee,” I said.

*Come now, come now, come.*

That was six months ago. The meetings continue every morning at 3:33 AM. The membership changes—people heal and graduate, new people find us through whispered recommendations, through the quiet network of night-shift workers and fellow insomniacs who understand that some churches meet in basements and some prayers happen after midnight.

I’ve learned to sleep again, mostly. But I still wake at 3:30, still make coffee, still light the electric candles my grandmother left carefully stored in boxes marked “For the Meetings.” I’ve added my own photos to the walls—snapshots of breakthrough moments, of laughter shared in a basement at 4 AM, of people learning to carry their grief without being crushed by it.

The neighbors still nod knowingly when delivery trucks ask about the coffee deliveries, the steady stream of quiet visitors, the warm golden light visible through the basement windows in the deepest part of the night. Mrs. Patterson brings homemade cookies every few weeks. Mr. Hendricks stops by to check that our space heater is working properly, that we have enough supplies.

“Your grandmother would be proud,” he told me last week. “She knew the meetings would continue. Knew someone would step up to keep the space sacred.”

*We are here, we are here, we are.*

I understand now what grandmother left me. Not just a house, but a purpose. Not just inherited grief, but inherited healing. Not just isolation, but a template for creating community in the spaces where community is needed most.

Every morning at 3:33 AM, they gather in my basement. People who’ve learned that darkness can hold light, that night-shift healing is healing nonetheless, that the hour when most people sleep can be the hour when others learn to live again.

*Step, step, step.* The sound of people coming home.

And I make the coffee, light the candles, and ring my bell three times—for what I lost, for what I found, and for the sacred inheritance of understanding that healing, like grief, doesn’t punch a time clock.

The meetings will continue. In this basement, in these dark hours, in the company of people brave enough to gather when the rest of the world sleeps. Because someone needs to tend the lighthouse. Someone needs to prove that 3:33 AM can be an hour of hope instead of despair.

*Ring, ring, ring.*

my wife and I are looking for our very first bikes and I’m a bit lost in the road / gravel / all-road jungle. Hoping for some advice!

**About us:**

* We live in the Dolomites (Northern Italy).
* Terrain: paved roads, bike lanes (sometimes not asphalted), mountain passes, rough roads, and plenty of routes that turn into gravel.
* Me: coffee rides, social rides, endurance, some 100km+ tours.
* My wife: riding together, coffee rides, getting fitter.

**What we need:**

* Relaxed geometry, versatile gearing (important for my wife’s motivation).
* Low-maintenance bikes (I’m no mechanic).
* Budget: max €2000 per bike.
* Prefer good alu frames now and maybe upgrade to carbon wheels later.

**Shortlist so far:**  
Canyon Allroad, Trek Domane / Checkpoint, Specialized Diverge, Megamo West / Jakar, Merida Silex 400 / Scultura Endurance, Rose Backroad AL.

I know these all ride a bit differently, but which ones would you recommend for us? Any other suggestions welcome too!

1nf1ez9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nf1ez9/explore_if_cascade_platinum_plus_dishwasher_pods/,Explore if Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pods Really Deliver,"Testing out the Cascade Platinum Plus (model P_15261) dishwasher detergent over the past few weeks has turned into a bit of an experiment in kitchen efficiency for me. As someone who loves cooking but doesn’t necessarily love the aftermath of washing residue-caked plates, I take dishwasher detergent pretty seriously. To keep things real, I ran a range of dishwashing scenarios—from the dreaded lasagna-baked-on tray to crystal wine glasses straight from dinner parties. Spoiler alert: It performed really well, but, as with most things, it isn’t without its quirks.  

**Design and Formula**  
The premeasured ActionPacs of this dishwasher detergent might not scream excitement, but they’re practically genius. Each one contains an impressive hit of grease-fighting Dawn and scrubbing ingredients, which Cascade claims is 2X the power compared to their other packs. I didn’t go into this with a magnifying glass to measure the exact difference, but I will say this: They dissolve efficiently, leaving no weird powder clumps or goo around, even on the shortest cycles. Plus, the phosphate-free claim is a nice touch for anyone concerned about plumbing or environmental impacts.  

[Check Cascade Platinum Plus P_15261 price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b0dpln3pbl/)

**Performance on Stubborn Grease and Stains**  
Remember that lasagna tray I mentioned? This was the ultimate test. I deliberately left it overnight, dried to a crusty glory, because let’s be honest, that’s real life. No pre-rinse, no soaking—just the Cascade Platinum Plus loaded in the dishwasher. The result? Shiny, spotless cookware as if nothing had baked on them in the first place. Even pasta residue stains? Gone. The larger liquid top in these packs promises extra cleaning power, and for once, that marketing blurb didn’t feel like a lie.  

**Versatility Across Various Items**  
Switching between grimy pots to delicate glassware gave me the chance to see if the product’s shine claims held up. I’m happy to report that glassware emerged gleaming with no visible spots or film left behind. I also appreciated how it performed consistently on utensils, plastics, and even that sketchy reusable coffee cup that’s listed as “dishwasher safe” but always seems to tempt fate.  

**Good Points**  
- 100% food residue removal is no exaggeration—even dried-on meals don’t stand a chance.  
- A sleek premeasured design that fits effortlessly into detergent compartments.  
- The formula actively helps prevent hard water spots and keeps dishes visibly shiny.  
- Works equally well on heavy-duty cookware and delicate items like drinkware.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- These pods emit quite a strong scent, especially when you open the bag. While I personally didn’t mind the Mountain Fresh fragrance, it might be a bit much for fragrance-sensitive folks.  
- Comparatively, the pack count feels limited, especially if you run bigger households or need to do multiple loads daily.  

**Product Competitors**  
Looking at competing brands like Finish Powerball or Seventh Generation’s Free & Clear detergent pods, Cascade Platinum Plus has carved itself a unique identity. Finish Powerball offers stellar grease-cutting abilities but often lags behind on residue removal for glassware. Seventh Generation, meanwhile, boasts a more natural composition but sometimes doesn’t deliver the spotless shine on tougher loads. What sets Cascade apart is its mix of brute strength with polished finesse, though that stronger scent gives it slightly less marks than more fragrance-free rivals.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Evaluating the value of a dishwasher detergent goes beyond just the price tag—it’s about performance per load, too. While Cascade Platinum Plus occasionally leans higher on the cost spectrum, its effectiveness means you’re not re-washing or pre-scrubbing (which is a time and water saver). For anyone who runs their dishwasher daily and wants consistently gleaming results, it checks enough boxes to be budget-friendly in the long run.

1nf1dt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nf1dt2/theres_something_wrong_with_michael/,There's Something Wrong With Michael,"**6/9/2025**

Ever since I first began at my current job, there’s been something off about Michael. 

He’s not right. He’s never been right. His unexplainable *wrongness* sits somewhere in the crease of his eyebrow, beneath his yellowing fingernails, the dip in his tongue when he laughs, and it simmers, it boils and radiates off him in coils of steam and mist. 

It first gripped me on my second day. Michael has his own office - it’s a closed off little area, but without privacy. The ‘walls’ are sheets of thick glass, and he sits facing the rest of us in our closed-off cubicles. He just sits there, and his monitors are just the right height to peer over the screens with his beady eyes and watch and watch. He’s always typing, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look at the keyboard. 

I don’t know what Michael does for work. I’ve asked just about everyone here, who all seem pretty normal for the most part, and they’ve all said something about logistics, but I don’t know what makes him so important he gets his own office. It’s not that he needs it, either. No one ever goes to him for meetings, and he certainly doesn’t need any sort of noise-proofing. I wonder, sometimes, if he does anything at all. If his monitors face away from us to hide that nothing is ever done with them. Maybe, I once reasoned, it was some sort of money-laundering thing, a fake employee who gets paid minimum wage to do nothing while the big boss pockets an extra manager's salary. That idea was stomped out when Jake From Finance showed me all the actual fake employees for money laundering, and they’re not even real, so why waste £25,000 a year on bloody Manager Michael? I also asked Jake From Finance if he could make an employee called Fergus Knife, but apparently that would make us suspicious. As if Michael isn’t the most suspicious bloke around.

So, he’s been like this for three years now: a mystery. And I don’t even like mysteries that much. But I don’t like my job significantly more than I don’t like mysteries, so I may as well put my energy into figuring out Michael rather than accounting for a company that surely isn’t meeting their employee competence quota anyway, considering the vast number of workers that legitimately do not exist, and the therefore vast number of working hours completely unaccounted for. So this brings me to you: here, I will document Micheal and the weird things he does with some commentary! Lucky you. I doubt this will go anywhere, as we probably all know a Michael, so if I never update, It’s because I’m crazy and Michael was normal the whole time. But I will update. Because Micheal is *not normal* I swear to God. 

**7/9/25 - Michael, Entry one:**

**7:45**

I arrive at work 15m early, hoping to catch Michael sleeping at his desk with his eyes open. Michael is not there and I get bored.



**7:57**

I go to the bathroom, Michael is still not there.



**8:00**

I leave the bathroom. Michael is at his desk. Michael seems to have made himself a coffee from the breakroom machine. Circa five minutes per coffee. How was that so fast, Michael?



**9:45**

Micheael wasn’t doing anything, so I speedrun making myself a coffee from the breakroom machine. There and back, four minutes 28 seconds, timed. *How was that so fast, Michael?*



**9:52**

I got bored again, and decided to approach Michael. As I walk up to his window/door, he doesn’t make eye contact with me at all, or even try to express some sort of recognition. He’s still watching, though, eyes razor focused somewhere in the distance from over his computer. It takes three knocks for him to spring into action. 



He stands up to greet me, pushing open the swinging door and gesturing with one suited arm to invite me in. It’s the kind of greeting that should be paired with a smile, but Michael doesn’t smile. He laughs, but he doesn’t smile. 



It’s silent for too long, and when Michael finally speaks, he only says “yes?”, like I had just asked a question. 



“Hi, Michael. I was just going to make myself another coffee. Would you like one as well?”



I expected this to confuse him, and in part, I wanted to. I wanted to see him show any kind of understanding of regular customs. 



“You had a coffee recently.”



Right. Dim of me to think he wasn't survailling my every move. 



“I’m going to have another one.”



Michael nods. “Yes.”



“Sorry?”



“It’s okay.”



“No, like, pardon?”



Michael nods again, like put on repeat. “Yes, I would like another coffee.”



“Alright. How do you like your coffees, Michael?”



“Normal.”



“Sorry?”



“Sorry like pardon?”



“Yes.”



“Okay, I would like it with milk.”



I nod like a therapist. “Right. So, a flat white? Cappuccino?”



“Two.”



“You want a cappuccino?”



“What is that?” Michael tilts his head to one side.



I sigh. “I’m just going to make you a flat white, okay?”



“Yes, very good.”



“Thanks, Michael. I’ll be back soon.”

  


**9:55**



I make Michael a long black. 

  


**10:00**



When I give Michael his coffee, he takes one (1) sip.



“Is it good?”



“Yes, I appreciate it.” What an odd bloke. 



I just nod, and as I go to leave, I maneuver around his office unnecessarily, and crane my neck to peer over Michael’s shoulder at his monitor screen. He’s already facing away from me, back ram-rod straight and staring into nothingness.

On his screen though, is more interesting than anything he might find outside of his office. 



**10:01**



I’m still not sure what I expected to see on his screen. The home screen to a search engine. Bland emails with nothing to them. Maybe even some obscure logistics dashboard with cryptic acronyms and no clear reason.



Instead, I see a still image. It’s monochrome, grainy, like it’s from a CCTV feed or pulled off an old VHS tape.



It’s my desk. 



My too small cubicle, just off-center, as if the camera had been placed somewhere beneath the overhead light. I can see my water bottle, a half-eaten protein bar I forgot to throw out, the coffee from fifteen minutes ago, still faintly steaming. I don’t remember seeing a camera.



I blink. When I look again, it's from a different angle, higher up now, and it's harder to make out with the low quality. The timestamp changes, 10:00:57. There’s a blur in the frame, a figure, paused mid-step.



It’s me. My hand is halfway in my pocket. I remember doing that, fishing for my phone. 



And then it jumps out at me, an awful, fizzing pot of nausea and confusion and bone-deep terror. The footage is a minute old, and it’s not an old recording. It’s just delayed. 



Michael starts typing. 



I snap my head to him, eyes jumping up faster than the rest of me. Michael is still facing forward, staring at the glass wall. His reflection stares back at him, fingers the only part of him that are moving.

“You are feeling good?”

The hairs on my neck rise, cold sweat dripping down my back. I step backward toward the door, eyes on Michael’s, in the window. Michael’s eyes on his own. 

“Yeah. Just making sure you’re enjoying the coffee.”

He doesn’t respond.

I leave the room.



**10:03**

Back at my desk, I check the ceiling. There’s no camera there. I open my laptop.

My webcam light is on.

Forget what I said before. I will be updating this. There is definitely something wrong with Michael.



**8/9/2025**

Okay, it’s 7:30 right now, and I’m hoping to get to work before Michael today. I’m not making the mistake of looking away from his desk for even a moment. I need to know how he got there so quickly last time. Then, I had given him the benefit of the doubt, but his weirdness is no longer something up for debate. I’m starting to wonder now whether I should tell my co-workers - I know for a fact, despite all my narcissism, that I am not the only one Michael is watching. Will they believe me though? Probably not. Do I risk it anyway?

I guess that’s something to worry about later. I’m going to head off now, but I’ll give you live updates. Well, for me they’re live.

**8/9/25 - Michael: Entry two**

**7:54**

Arrived a bit later than hoped (got tempted by a Greggs - sausage roll is bomb btw) but still here before Michael. I’m quite surprised he doesn’t just live here. It’s somehow more jarring that he goes somewhere else. Does he have a family? A landlord? Does he have friends? I can’t imagine any of the three. The fact Michael can vote is astounding to me. 

Whatever, I’m just going to wait for him to rock up. He’ll probably levitate up the building instead of taking the lift.



**7:59**

One minute. Ooooh, this is so exciting guys!



**8:00**

I blinked. 

I swear to you, I blinked, and Michael was at his desk. No coffee this time. Maybe the machine is broken in hell, or wherever he comes from. I don’t know what just happened, but I’m positive that man did not walk there. 



**8:02**

I turn to Priya, ask her about Michael getting here so quickly. She just says that she “never notices him, anyway.” “couldn’t possibly” tell me the “exact time he gets here each day.” I really don’t like that she makes me sound like a stalker when Michael legitimately has live CCTV footage of my desk at all times. Probably hers, too. I don’t tell her that out of spite.

As far as I know, the footage is silent. He doesn’t wear any sort of ear piece (the thought of Michael wearing airpods is hilarious) and when I was there, his office was as silent as it could be. Maybe I should be careful anyway though. 



**8:45**

Michael still hasn’t moved. He’s blinked a couple of times, and I’m probably looking into it too much, but it’s almost like something he does on purpose, not because he needs to. It’s hardly the worst accusation to make of him, though, considering everything. He’s worse than watching paint dry. I decided to talk to Jake From Finance.



**8:48**

Overheard Jake From Finance discussing confidential information. Will update.



**8:50**

I just convinced Jake From Finance to help me gain access to confidential information! 

Top bloke, he is. Apparently the finance guys all know about these weird misfiled documents tucked in with the stocks dataset or something. They probably just threw them at the most chronically uncurious people to ever exist. Jake From Finance tells me he “just never thought about looking at them”, but they’re on his computer as *The Files of Death.* He spells it as ‘fiels.’



**8:53**

Jake From Finance is getting us through a firewall. He says it’s not a firewall and that “they don’t work that way”, but I don’t care. Apparently, he went to uni for computer science. I will once again remind you that he can’t spell the word ‘files’.



**9:01**

We’re in. That’s what Jake From Finance said when a long list of digital folders appeared lined up neatly in a backlog. “We're in”, like he’s the pro-hacker tomboy daughter of a mechanic with a strip of purple in her hair that impresses the main character in a coming of age movie because she knows how to change a tire. 

“What do you think is actually in here?” I ask.

“Probably something to do with all the money laundering we do.”

I nod. “You reckon anything interesting?”

“May as well find out.”

Jiff (That’s his name now, Jake From Finance is mad long and JFF sounds too much like JFK), clicks on the first folder that popped up, and double clicks one of the many yellow files. 

When the folder loads, it’s full of images. Jiff scrolls and scrolls and there are so many they blur into each other, one big grey pixelated sludge. 

Jiff scrunches his nose. “This is pretty weird.”

“Is it?” I furrow my brow. It’s just pictures. 

“Yeah. It’s just full of PDFs. Usually, written documents wouldn’t be in folders as PDFs, but more likely in a shared drive, or doc or something. These are like, old.”

“The titles say they’re only from a few years ago?”

Jiff shakes his head. “No, look at them, they’ve been scanned. They look like they’re from ages ago. At least, long enough ago that documents were physically typed out with typewriters.”

“Cool. Can we see one?”

Jiff clicks on one at random, INDEX/VEILPROTOCOL, his eyes scanning the screen while it loads. The look on his face worries me - it’s like this isn’t something he sees a lot. For a moment, I wonder if I want to back out. If I even want to know what’s in here if it’s anything to do with whatever is going on with Micheal.

The PDF loads before I have the chance to look away.

All Jake can do is stare. It’s all I can do, either. The screen is too bright and the words feel so close to my face they burn my retinas. I turn to Jake.

“What is this?”

“I don’t know.”

“What does it mean?”

“I don’t know.”

“Is this real?”

He pauses. “I don’t know.”

I breathe in, breath catching in my throat, pulse beating loudly and blood pulsing in my ears. “We need to look at another one.”

“No.”

I glare at him. “No?”

“We can’t. I need a drink.”

Jake slams his computer shut, too hard. His face is as blank as Micheal’s. It scares me. 

I don’t follow him.



**9:20**

The office is suffocatingly normal. A reminder that no one else felt the way I just did. No one else feels ruined forever. A joke. It must be that. A joke. 

The other secrets it’s tucked text to aren’t a joke though. The financial crime, the laundering. I purposefully don’t think about that. 

When I sit back at my desk, Priya isn’t there. She’s my only friend here, unless we count Jake, I guess. But she felt so normal, where he just seemed like somebody who could easily become a Michael. Priya’s desk isn’t hers, though. Somebody else is there. Somebody else’s photos on the desk, somebody else's stickers on the borders of their computer screen. 

I ask HR where Priya went. Maybe, in those 30 minutes I was gone, she’d gotten a promotion and moved seven years of work from a 1.5m\^2 desk and taken the lift up a floor.

But they just look at me with a mix between confusion and pity, and say with such conviction, that Priya Das doesn’t work here, and never has.



**16:04**

I’m heading home now. Technically, I still have an hour left to get my hours in this week, but nobody’s going to notice. If they do, they won’t care. 

It’s dark outside now, and the walls of Michael’s office are reflecting the lights of London below, smears of warm yellow and cool blue streaked over the glass.

As I write this, I’m watching Michael as he stares into nothing. I can’t find his reflection. 



**18:24**

I just got back from the gym. I ran until I couldn’t anymore. There’s an email in my inbox from Jake, and the subject line is just “There are more.”

I need a shower, and I need to eat something. I’ll show you when I open the email, if I open the email.



**19:05**

As promised:

I don’t know what to do. 



**9/8/2025**

**7:05**

I didn’t sleep last night. It’s not like I didn’t want to. I wasn’t up late thinking about Michael or work or Jake or Priya, I was doing everything but. Keeping my mind off it. It wasn't working, of course, but both my mind and body were exhausted and needed sleep and it just wouldn’t come. 

I’m beginning to miss Priya. I never realised how much I liked her until she was gone. Is she gone? Can somebody who was never there be gone?

Was Priya ever there?

The more I think about it, the more I remember Lucy. She sits where Priya sat. Apparently, that’s where she always sat. I remember her being there, too. She went to my 28th birthday earlier this year. She got me a candle, and it’s on my bedside table.

Priya was there too, though. And she got me a tie with flowers on it, and a card nicer than I had expected from her. I still have the tie, but I can’t find the card.

One time, Priya left work early, but she went to the bathroom first, and on the way out, I saw her mascara streaming down her face like a pitch black waterfall. She was on the phone, and the voice on the other side was louder than her soft sobs. Everyone heard, I’m sure, but their pitiful looks weren’t going to be enough. 

I followed her outside, and when I stepped onto the pavement, I saw Priya, pleading with somebody through the window of a sleek red car, shaking in the sharp cold of winter. Her arms were bare, save for where somebody’s hand was clasped around her bicep, far too tightly. The other arm had bruises that weren’t there minutes before. The man inside was talking quietly, but it was scarier than when he was yelling over the phone. I recognised him from the photos on her desk - her, him, and two beautiful children. Very young. Too young to understand what it means to have a dad that talks to your mum like this one did. 

I remember, I pretended to call the police. Spoke loud enough for both of them to hear it. “There’s a woman on Downing street in trouble. She’s hurt and in danger.”

I rattled off the number plate as he drove off, anger blazing in his eyes. I remember worrying I’d made it worse for her. I paid for her taxi, and she didn’t say anything until she left, when she shook my hand and said “thank you” so sincerely I had to clench my jaw so as not to cry. A week later, when I walked in to work, Priya had changed the photos on her desk, and now they only showed a family of three.

Something like that, I don’t think I could ever have made up. Someone as complex and as real as Priya couldn’t have come from me, it’s a disservice to her. 

I only hope that if she’s gone, she took her children, and that man, with her into non-existence. I hope that her children are not left with only one man to raise them. 

For Priya, I’ve decided I’m going to figure this out before it becomes more than what it is. Whether or not it will bring her back, it can’t happen to anyone else. It can’t happen to Jake. It can’t happen to me. 



**8:15**

I just got here. I’m late, but the receptionist didn’t say anything about it. I don’t think he would have noticed if I’d spontaneously combusted in front of him. Maybe he’s a Michael. I’ve decided I’m going to go find Jake From Finance and gaslight him into looking further into this whole incomprehensible horror thing.



**8:22**

Good news! Jiff didn’t need any gaslighting, he was down anyway. He’s throwing up in the bathroom right now due to stress and it’s my turn once he’s done, but after that we’re going for a coffee and looking through the weird little files. I’ll get him to send them to me, and I’ll do a little copy-paste motive in here.



**8:40**

Just thought of a joke - Michael heard someone say “here’s your work monitor” and he took that literally. Not good enough to say out loud but good enough to go in here.



**10:30**

Oops sorry I’m late I forgot! It’s all the same to you though. I’ve been back for about 30m, and nothing weird has happened since then. I think I’m becoming conditioned to the strangeness of this place. Or maybe I’m in shock. Nothing is really affecting me the way it should be, but I’m waiting for the pin to drop, the moment I go crazy. I’ll paste the documents below.

Pretty weird stuff. We noticed though, that even when all these are addressed to a great number of employees, there are very few with, or who had in the past, access to them. I wonder if me and Micheal even work at the same place. I wonder if I actually work anywhere at all. 



**10:58**

Just got back from the bathroom, and something weird has happened. Shock.

There’s something on my computer. It’s just an off-white screen, like old paper, and black text sprawling across the middle. It’s not text, actually. It’s just symbols. 

\[photo attached\]

⧗⚚⦽\_⚏⚚\_ ᚘ⚚⦻\_⍌⚚⫽⍙\_⫷⋇⫽⋇

I don’t know what it means. I don’t know if it means anything. I don’t know if I care. 



**19:47**

I’m breaking into Michael’s office.

Honestly, it’s getting ridiculous. It’s been three days and I’m losing my bloody mind. Three days, and I’ve witnessed Michael stalking me, we’ve uncovered a bureaucratic horror, a colleague has transcended into the abyss by osmosis or something. So I am breaking into Michael’s office.

It’s really not hard. I only have to gently push the door.

I don’t know when he left. I was probably playing Candy Crush or something. Jiff says he doesn’t want to break in with me but I know he’s gonna get FOMO and do it anyway, so I guess I’ll just wait until he changes his mind.



**19:50**

Jiff has changed his mind! 



**20:40**

We just broke into Michael’s office.

# I know, with absolute certainty, that he was not there. Not from the outside, at least. His chair was tucked in all neat, monitor shut down and screen black and shiny. Micheal was not in his office.

Except that he was.

We pushed open the door, and Michael was there, more real than he’d ever been to me, more real than he’d possibly ever been. Completely wild.

Inside the office, it was windy. And so, so cold. The painful kind that bites at you and creeps under jumpers and scarves, wraps around and suffocates you through your clothing. 

Michael was at his desk, and he was typing. 

Not words, symbols, ones I recognised from my own monitor just hours before, and faces, colours, sounds. The monitor flickered as the office warped. Colours so bright they hurt to look at, faces of every emotion, of all of them at once, but each so intense they couldn’t have meant anything but hate. Michael was still, stiff as a board, like taxidermy. But he was alive, so much so that who he seemed to be before couldn’t have been something living at all. 

His face mirrored those on screen. Ecstatic joy, desperate sadness, terrified anger, flashing one after the over so fast one was indistinguishable from the other. The only constant was his eyes, black as coal, two shiny pebbles pushed into skin and bone, boring into their own reflection. His eyes never closed.

Paper flew through the air so quickly each sheet became streaks of pure white, and sharp enough to slice through skin. Pens, paperweights, cupholders, carried on the wind but moving on their own, as if chasing each other. The room was, in its entirety, in control. Colours flashed across my eyes, from the monitor, from Michael, from my own mind, I wasn’t sure. But through all the noise of the office, the blood pulsing in my ears, the howling wind and clatter of supplies thrashing across the room, Micheae’s whispers were louder. 

It was like chanting, it was in reverence. The softest, breathiest rasp of words rising from the ground like smoke, shaking the floor and resting in my chest like a heavy bass. So quiet, but the loudest thing I had ever heard. 

What he said, I can’t understand. Every word, every language, every tone of voice. But loudest of all, laced with hate and kindness, disgust and worship:



**You do not work here.** 



And then, I was alone. Jake left, or maybe he was never there, and the absence of another person weighed on me like a conscience. I was alone. Or, maybe the problem was that I wasn’t alone at all.

Because it wasn’t just me and Michael in the office. I wasn’t sure that Michael had ever been just one person. I wasn’t sure that Michael had been a person at all since I’d known him. And with all that he’d tried to become something uninteresting, he was the least human thing I’d ever seen.

What colour was his hair again? I couldn’t remember. Maybe I had never known. The only thing I could remember was those eyes. Those black pebble eyes that never seemed to look at anything. But a face? Did he ever have one?

But he must have. He must have had a face, because I had seen it morph into hatred and love and sadness and confusion like wet clay, thick but fluid like sticky molasses, melted butter. Maybe all Michael had ever been was a reflection. 

Of what, I wasn’t sure. I’m still not sure. But it’s not something from his office. Michael’s office is from it - whatever it is. And It’s been here longer than anyone else has. There’s something in Michael, a parasite that feeds, embedded in code. In the code of the computers, in the genetic code of the mind. 

You need to listen to me. It’s in the code.



**23:30**



I’m back at home now.

I haven’t tried speaking to Jake. I don’t know if Jake was ever with me today. I hope he wasn’t. I hope he didn’t go through that alone, as well. 

I wonder, is he with Priya? Will somebody else be in his cubicle tomorrow? Will I be in mine?

Because that’s just the thing, isn’t it? Micheal was just like me, once. Before he got the emails. Before he became ‘Authorised Personnel’, however many of them there are. 

And I’ve left his office, but his office hasn’t left me, and there’s not a single screen in my apartment that isn’t lit up a blazing white, symbols of crisp black cutting through the centre.

1nf1cgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Question/comments/1nf1cgg/free_vpns_for_iphone_which_ones_are_actually/,Free VPNs for iPhone: Which Ones Are Actually Worth It?,"A lot of people stick with free VPNs on iPhone coz they just want quick protection when using sketchy WiFi, like in airports or coffee shops. Nobody wants to pay a big subscription just to check emails or log into their bank safely. If the VPN doesn’t slow things down or throw annoying ads, most folks feel it’s good enough for casual use.

The tricky part is that not all free VPNs are worth it. From what I’ve seen, PrivadoVPN Free is solid coz it’s fast and gives about 10GB a month. Proton VPN Free is a go-to for people who care more about privacy, plus it gives unlimited data, even if you don’t get to pick every server. Windscribe Free works well as an all-rounder, and Hide.me Free also stands out with unlimited data, though speeds can be hit or miss.  
  
If it was me, I’d start with PrivadoVPN Free for day-to-day browsing and emails, then keep Proton VPN Free as backup for when I need more data or better privacy. Having a fallback like Windscribe or Hide.me helps too coz sometimes one app acts up. This way, you don’t end up stuck without protection when you really need it. If you’re cool with spending a little for peace of mind, low-cost paid plans are out there and usually more stable. But for casual use, yeah, there are decent free iPhone VPNs that people trust, and they definitely make public WiFi less stressful.",1,1757678606.0,VPN_Question,0,1.0,False

1nf12r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nf12r3/something_was_wrong_about_ms_katzs_garden/,Something was wrong about Ms. Katz's garden,"When I first met my neighbor, Ms. Katz, she scared the shit out of me.

I was walking up the cracked sidewalk to her front door to introduce myself because I had just finished moving in and wanted to start getting to know my neighbors. The house was uniquely large compared to all of the other homes on the street; adorned with steep slanted roofs and vertical wooden framing, a cacophony of plants bursting over the back yard fence on either side.

It was the house that ended the street; the pavement of the road and sidewalk abruptly cut off into grass.

The door was thick wood that looked like it weighed a ton. The brass gargoyle door knocker rapped loudly, echoing into the house as I stood for a moment waiting for a reply. I jumped when a creaky voice from my left said,

“Hello there Deary.” I turned to look down at a cheery old woman’s face that was wrinkled in a closed-eyed smile. I was startled, it felt like she had scared me on purpose.

The backyard gate slammed shut and I noticed that the old woman was wiping dirt off of her hands; she must have been gardening. “Hello to you as well! I just moved in next door.” I said, trying to be friendly.

“Welcome to the neighborhood, my name is Catrina Katz, just call me Katz deary.” She opened her eyes and continued smiling, but I was taken aback again. Her eyes were yellow. Very yellow. They looked like sickly saucers of spoiled milk. My apprehension turned to empathy for Ms.Katz - yellow eyes can mean liver problems, something my own grandmother had struggled with it for years.

“I just wanted to say hello, I am going to go get back to unpacking, you should come over for dinner sometime! Nice meeting you,” I said.

“I’m sure I will deary,” Ms.Katz said, then she turned back towards the backyard gate, glancing one more time at me before getting to her gardening, and I went back to my new home, which was filled with boxes that needed my attention.

That night I slept poorly, the house was dead quiet, the only noise was the air conditioning unit kicking on every once in a while.

I am a very light sleeper, so that’s why I woke up when a strange noise started permeating through the edges of my sleepy consciousness.

There was a sound so quiet that a normal person would have slept through it. I lay covered in my bed, sensitive ears straining to discern what the noise was. It sounded like someone was digging in mud.

I sat up, trying to quiet my breathing so I could hear where it was coming from, but my wooden floors made the sound reverberate from all directions in my room. I could not work up the courage to get out bed and investigate, something told me I should just lay down and put on some white noise to ignore it.

Every night for a week did just that, ignoring the noise and getting some decent sleep.

When I asked my other neighbor Todd - a nice middle-aged truck driver- one day if he had heard the noise he said he didn’t know anything about it,

“I bet you it’s Ms. Katz. You can catch her out pretty late sometimes. Between you and me, I think she has a bit of dementia. Just a bit. She loves her gardening. I’ve even seen her doing it at night which is weird but to each their own. She must love it. She imports special fertilizer all the time. Here comes a truck now.” He nodded towards her house.

A van pulled into the driveway. It had a purple flower logo on the metal siding that was indeed befitting of a fertilizer company. A burly man dressed in all black greeted Ms. Katz at her gate and started carrying brown sacks into her back yard. She noticed us watching and gave a cheery wave to us, while we waved back Todd said,

“Really sweet woman. I’ve known her for years. She’s been living on Belmont Avenue as long as anyone can remember. Makes great apple pie.”

I decided to see the garden for myself that afternoon.

I made it look like I was cleaning my gutters, which to be fair, were disappointingly dirty no thanks to my landlord. I stood up on my roof to peer over the bushes spilling into my back yard, only then realizing what a jungle Ms. Katz’s backyard was. Bushes, flowers, vines, short and tall trees, birdbaths, stone pathways, you name it. If Ms. Katz was really doing it all herself, it had to have taken up all of her time. The garden was in pristine condition and scattered throughout the yard were the large brown fertilizer sacks, some ripped open with black soil spilling out.

There was a smell that rose out of the backyard and drifted towards me as I studied the garden. A sickly-sweet stench that was quite pungent. I could see lavender, rose and dracaena flowers so it was possible they were responsible for the strange odor.

Something was wrong though. A part of my brain was reminded at the time of how my grandfather’s large liquid fly traps smelled when they were full to the brim with dead insects. I was also reminded of rancid meat you discovered had been molding in the back of your fridge for weeks.

An itch on the back of my neck grew while I was scouting. It took me a minute to notice the yellow eyes peering at me between large purple curtains out of the corner of my vision. I was startled and turned to look back at Ms.Katz, unsure of how long she had been staring at me. She waved and smiled, nodding towards her garden like It was quite special before going inside.

I couldn’t be sure but before I turned to face her I could’ve sworn she was looking at me with a face contorted in utter hatred.

It was 9 nights ago when I watched Ms. Katz die.

When I woke, I was confused. I could make out the soft noise from nights before that still somehow demanded every ounce of my attention. I looked to my nightstand and realized my phone was not playing my white noise, I must have forgotten to turn it on.

I decided it was time to confront Ms. Katz. If she really did have dementia, maybe I could just talk to her and she would realize she should be asleep and not doing whatever weird shit she was doing in the middle of the night.

I crept through the house, slowly opening the back door. The sound of crickets and rustling leaves mixed with the digging noise that was now sharp and clear. I could not stop myself from approaching a peephole in the fence.

When I was a few spans from the fence the sound suddenly stopped. I froze, waiting. A rhythmic thumping noise started coming down over the fence. What was she up to now? I had to know what she was doing. One eye closed, I peered through the hole into the back yard. 

The back yard looked like it did when I last saw it, winding stone paths now illuminated by moonlight. More fertilizer bags were open and the garden beds were torn up like plants were being rearranged.

I quickly found her. Ms.Katz was on a ladder pulling at one of the fertilizer bags which was stuck in one of her second story windows. Pulling does not properly describe the motion. Ms. Katz was throwing her body weight faster than what seemed possible away from the window, the bag inching with each heave. She thrashed again and again and again. It looked like it hurt. It looked like her arms should have dislocated.

I started panicking, clearly Ms. Katz had more than “a little bit of dementia” like Todd had said. I needed to help her, to get her to a hospital and make sure she was mentally sound. But it was too late.

Suddenly Ms. Katz lost her grip on the bag, the cloth tearing from the tensile force, and in an instant was falling off of the ladder. She was weightless, air whipping her stained nightgown about while she plummeted. A pit formed in my stomach when I saw where she would land, the inevitable becoming more terrifying with each second.

*SPLAT.*

One of the short concrete bird baths that had a pointed house had completely pierced the abdomen of the elderly woman. I stood frozen while I processed what was happening.

Not a single cry was uttered. Her death was instant, a hole the size of a basketball oozing blood where her stomach had been made me fall to knees and retch into the grass.

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 as I started frantically searching for my dinky ass Walgreens first aid kit. An operator picked up.

The operator asked in a calm voice,

""911 what is your emergency?""

“My neighbor is dead! She fell off a ladder and impaled herself on a bird bath!"" I yelled, panting as I sprinted down the sidewalk.

The operator was clearly used to these kinds of calls, “Ok slow down sir. What is the address?”

“- redacted address-. Please hurry! Please!” I stammered out as fast as I could,

“What is her name sir?”

“Catrina Katz. She’s bleeding please-”

“Sir, is this a joke?”

“What do you mean? I’m telling you the truth”

I stopped in my tracks. I was so high on adrenaline I couldn’t understand what was happening.

“We’ve had at least eight calls like this in the past year. Ms. Katz has always been fine when we respond.”

“I don’t understa-“

“She is an elderly lady who does not need this harassment. I will not repeat myself. If you call again, I am sending an officer to arrest you for misuse of the 911 line. Goodbye.” The operator hung up.

The only sound left was my heavy breathing. I found myself walking towards the backyard gate, my momentum was the only thing that kept me going.

I pushed open the gate, scanning the backyard. There was no ladder laying on the ground.  Ms.Katz was gone. Somehow she was not skewered on the bird bath as she had been a minute ago. I kept moving forward, unable to stop myself from approaching the bird bath.

It was clean, its undisturbed state mocked my fear and panic. There was no blood, but when I touched the concrete bird bath house, it was warm.

I felt a pit in my stomach; the world was spinning around me. My head was pounding.

“Deary, what are you doing this time of night?” a sweet voice said, I whipped around. I felt like I was sinking into hysteria. 

The back door stood open, the wooden arch frame filled by Ms. Katz’s figure. There was no obvious sign of a gaping stomach wound, she appeared to have just woken up. She was looking at me, concern plain on the wrinkles of her face.

I could see into the house. A few old lamps were turned on. I could just make out old some ornate furniture covered in dust. The inside of the house certainly matched the outside.

There was something that caught my eye. It was one of the large fertilizer bags with the purple flower logo. Torn open and spilling over a wooden table onto the floor, the bag was not full of black soil. The bag was full of a bright flesh, indiscriminate chunks glistening in the lamp light.

“DEAR! I SAID ARE YOU OK?”, Ms. Katz yelled, snapping my eyes away from the bag of flesh. She was no longer a sweet old woman who wanted to make sure I was alright, her yellow eyes were strained open, demanding an answer from me, an explanation,

“I uh… I thought…” I stood there, mouth working, I couldn’t think. “I heard some commotion, I wanted to make sure everything was alright,” I stammered out, it seemed impossible that I was talking to someone that I just saw die. I felt nauseous. Doubt was flooding my mind. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Ms. Katz’s face eased into her usual sweet smile,

“No commotion deary. I promise you everything is alright. Go back home and get some rest. I am sure you will forget all about it in the morning” She looked at me, still smiling, but the smile did not reach her eyes, “it’s late. People go missing at night so you better be careful.”

She turned and slammed the door.

I did not sleep that night. Instead, I turned on every light in the house and locked myself in my bedroom. I played the events of the night over and over again in my head. Every time I convinced myself it was real, I would convince myself I must have dreamed it; had some kind of lucid nightmare. But nightmares don’t leave 911 calls on your phone history or dirt strung throughout your house. Nightmares don’t live next door.

In my shaken state come morning the only thing to do was to go to work. Work was consistent, and I figured it would sort things out for me to pretend everything was normal.

After I downed a third cup of coffee I strode out the door, the sun catching on morning fog welcomed me to a new day.

Todd stepped out of his door right after me. We nodded to each other, Todd’s expression soured when he saw something behind me. “None of my damn business,” Todd grumbled around a cigarette in his lips. I turned to see what he had seen.

A van with a large purple flower logo was backed up to Ms. Katz’s house, a few men unloading fertilizer bags. A part of me wanted to be drawn back into the events of last night. I pushed it down.

I decided Todd was right. It was not any of my business.

A full day of work set me back to a sense of normalcy. Pushing pencils for eight hours really clears your mind.

That night was silent, and I slept sounder than a hibernating bear without the need for a white noise machine. I waved to Ms. Katz when I saw her on my excursions out of the house. She often was garbed in gardening clothes, going in and out of her backyard. None of my business. For six days all was well.

Until I woke up three nights ago, soaked in sweat, muffled screaming filling my room.

I once had a friend of mine lose his arm. We were playing on some rocks in a forest during a camping trip, jumping back and forth between larger boulders, taking turns giving chase to one another. I was laughing while I chased my friend, both of us grinning ear to ear while we played.

My friend was climbing higher and higher up the slope of the mountain, taking each gap in one big stride at a time, taunting me to catch him. Just before my little pointer finger could reach out and tag him, he lost his footing and slipped.

I watched as my friend fell towards the ground below, and stood frozen as he began screaming in pain, bloody arm raised in the air, bone snapped in half at the forearm, sharp white bone dangling in two directions.

I had never heard so much pain expressed before. My friend screamed until his voice was raw, thrashing about on a rock below. If I had acted sooner, running down the mountain to grab our parents, my friend might have saved his arm. But as a kid I just stood frozen to the spot, unable to move.

I was frozen then, in my bed, as I listened to the pain unfolding before me.

“Help me please! Oh god! Oh god!”, it was muffled, the words could just barely be made out, but the pain was sharp and visceral.

A part of me wanted to roll over, turn on the white noise machine, and pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But I knew what I was going to do.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, forcing myself to take one step after another towards the house next door. There was no doubt this time. This was real. I needed to be braver, to not freeze, to help this person. The screaming grew clearer as I approached the house, slid through the gate and approached the back door.

“I’m so sorry! I promise….” the voice screeched. It was definitely coming from her house, I had to stop whatever was going on. I reached for the door,  knife held at the ready, swallowing when my hand grabbed the knurled knob and began to twist.

“I cant! I..”, the yelling suddenly cut off, stillness now deafening. Somehow the hinges of the door slid across each other smoothly, silently revealing the darkness of the house. Once inside, I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding as quietly as possible.

I moved through the room, past the old furniture, subconsciously aware of the bags of flesh strewn about, of the smell of death so rank I would normally empty the contents of my stomach. Passing old pieces of furniture covered in must, I found myself walking on kitchen tile, then rounding a doorway to face a steep wooden stairway.

Time started falling forwards on a fixed track, I was floating up the stairs. I barely noticed the loud thud that sounded like a deflated basketball was dropped.

Heat radiated from above, I was entering a tropical oven. The plaster of the walls was damp and rotted, wood molding visible in bare patches. A squelching noise started coming from upstairs and washing down over me.

I continued to move slowly towards the noise. At the top of the stairs was a hallway with closed side rooms and an open door at the end of the hall, the room behind the door illuminated by a sickly yellow ceiling light creeping out into the hall. Before I knew it I swung the door open, revealing the horrible scene inside.

It has taken me these days since that night to rationalize what I saw behind the door at the end of the hallway. In the moment my brain put my body into shock, I continued to act but was not comprehending how absolutely horrifying it all was.

The floor was covered in dirt and flesh. The two substances were mixed together to form a paste that was thick and gelatinous.

Ms. Katz’s head was staring at me, upside down in the mush, eyeless sockets fixed in my direction. The decapitated head looked something like a pale Jack-O-Lantern after weeks in the sun, all of the flesh had been scooped out from the inside. I could see through the eye sockets into the pale skull. The base of the head where the neck should be revealed a perfectly calcified circle that looked like a doll head might when you wrung it off of the body, a spacious cavity where a brain should be.

I peeled my eyes from the ground and looked forward.

A table was in the middle of the room. The rest of Ms. Katz was hunched over the table sitting on an old wooden stool. Her body was convulsing as something I couldn’t see was ripping into the chest of a dead body sprawled on the table. It must have been the person I had gone to save. Slurping and crunching filled the room.

There was screaming, it took me a second to realize that I was screaming.

Slowly the rest of Ms.Katz sat up from the table in the chair, out of the stump of her neck what looked like a slender frayed rope started stretching upward towards the ceiling. Brown and glistening like an insect carapace, slowly its head started rising from the dead body on the table, pulled upward until it was almost touching the ceiling. Tendrils roughly a foot in length sprouted like fuzzy antenna in all directions along the vine-like neck; they constantly moved and twitched as they felt their surroundings.

The head was covered in the same wriggly feelers, blacker than those on the neck. Once the head had risen almost five feet in the air, towering above me as an unholy obelisk, it twisted around to stare down at me.

Insect mandibles twitched and chomped, flesh smeared and stuck to the mouth area, falling down to the ground with thick splashes. The head was smaller than the discarded shell of a head on the ground by my feet, but the eyes were the same. The yellow eyes were large, bulging out of the hard carapace, no eyelids to conceal their bulbus shape. Its eyes were fixed on me, pure malice penetrating me to my core.

The next few moments occurred in the blink of an eye. Rapidly the tendrils of the neck started pulling the creature back into Ms. Katz. Each tendril would shoot down into the old woman’s body, accelerating the head downward. Sporadic jerks animated the her corpse, arms shooting out, a seizure of movements unfolding before me until the insectoid head was the only visible part of the parasite, resting on the body’s neck stump.

All was still, a standoff had begun. In shock I was rooted to the spot, a pit of dread opened up in my stomach and I became aware of my heart pounding in my ears.

It leaped toward me, pushing off the ground so hard I heard the floor break, crashing into me with force enough to break my ribs, sending us hurtling back through the hall way towards the stairs. On the ground we struggled, I somehow managed to grab its shoulders and pushed with all of my strength as it tried to pop my head open with its layers of jaws.

A full throated roar came out of me and I heaved us down the stairs. Each step smacked on the way down, at the bottom I rolled into the kitchen onto my back. I had broken ribs and an ankle twisted the wrong direction, so all I could do was crawl backwards from the stairwell door, where I could hear snapping sounds that meant it was getting up.

It forced Ms.Katz body to its feet, one arm disolacted and jutting upward, standing naked in the dark doorway. A fleshy stomach hole was filled with twisted knots of insectoid spaghetti where the bird bath had pierced through the body.  Its eyes were two yellow orbs of light swaying back and forth in the darkness of the doorway.

I noticed a shovel at my feet and frantically grabbed for it. I was too late. In the same moment I made my move, some of the knotted tendrils of Ms. Katz’s stomach wound shot out towards me.

The wet tendrils were thick and flew across the kitchen, striking my left shoulder and digging into my flesh. The muscles of the arm seized. My muscles were forced to contract harder than my brain would allow. Every single muscle cramped at the same time. My biceps relaxed as my triceps continued to flex which caused my arm to hyper extend. Bones cracked and my arm broke. I cried out in pain.

“Oh deary, I love the way you scream” it spoke to me with a voice that was broken, full of hateful mirth. It sounded like Ms. Katz was speaking while gargling crumbled bones. Suddenly my biceps flexed, snapping my arm the other way, my limp hand smacking into my shoulder. All I could do was grind my teeth and moan.

With my free arm holding the shovel I swung at the tendrils, severing them. It let out an ear blistering screech, insectoid head thrashing. Enraged, it crouched then lunged for me once more. I was ready this time.

Screaming my throat raw, I swung the shovel and hit it right between its eyes. One instant the shiny black mouth was going to tear my throat out, the next the carapace exploded, green slop flying in all directions. The body went limp and oozed all over me, tendrils seeping out over me onto the ground. The pungent smell of Ms. Katz body, old perfume, and rotting insect meat singed my nostrils. I could barely breath with all of the weight bearing down on me.

My shock wore off and panic set in. I frantically tried to push the corpse off of me, my hands slipping again and again, suffocating instigated desperation deep within me allowing me to drain the last of my strength to finally roll it off myself. Then I lay alone in the silent house.

I started sobbing. I took massive uncontrollable heaves of air into my body and let them out through tears and groans. I could not stop until every last possible emotion had been wailed out of me.

Once I was done, I stood numbly, used the shovel to limp my way out of the house, and packed a bag. I got into my car and rode out at dawn.

After a stop to the local urgent care where I told a true enough story about a bad fall down some stairs, I had a boot for my foot and bandages for my ribs. I drove as far as I could and stopped at a motel.

Three days later I am now writing from my third motel, slowly making my way back home, where I am going to try to forget all of this mess, and start over.

I am not sure what happened to Ms. Katz’s house or the bodies inside, and I don’t care. I needed to tell my story online because no one I know will believe me and because I am not sure if I will live to tell the tale anyways.

Every motel that I have stopped at has the same van that parks in the back of the lot at 3 am when I should be asleep and not notice. A van with a purple flower logo. They leave at 6 am before I should wake up.

I noticed each time because I have not slept since that night. I know I have nightmares waiting for me when I finally crash, but I am not ready to face them yet.

I'm a student, in class 12 rn, and I thought that my birthday's round the corner, 18th September, and I might as well get a grinder from my parents because last year I didn't get a birthday gift so I can add it with this one and buy c3s. So, my mother and I had a small argument. Once I justified the cost, she said I'll be going to a college next year and she doesn't want this expensive useless thing lying in her house, her words not mine. I said I would obviously take it with me duh and she said I won't be allowed to have it there?? Why not bruh pretty sure she's lying or something, don't put it past her. And now she's adamant about it that I can't get this because it's allegedly not allowed and I should just have a nice dinner on my birthday and be done with it. I know she's saying that because she wanna go somewhere nice to eat because I said I don't mind if we don't go out and spend 2k on food and just stay home if she gives me a grinder as a gift (need to cut costs somewhere, even offered to have no cake or anything) but she's more into celebrating her way and that means throwing my plans under the bus. Can't she wait for her birthday as November's pretty close 🥀🥀🥀

  
I know this ain't no place to rant this.

Besides, I also have 1.5k on backup, saved for a coffee scale, which I can use for the grinder but she's does not want to get it. Tough luck, any ideas how I can convince her? I tried saying she can give me 5k (so I can use my saved up money with it) but she still said no. I said 5k because that's what she spent on my little brother's birthday gift of two years (yeah both of us didn't get gifts last year lol).",0,1757677699.0,IndiaCoffee,5,0.5,False

my relationship with my partner was so beautiful. it was the best id ever had. we got on so well. communicated so well. i knew deep in my heart this was for life.

about 2 months ago we tried opening up our relationship. we felt like there was so much love between us that there was excess that we could give to others. that sounds so stupid now but we believed it.

my partner and the person they started seeing behaved very badly. everything moved very fast, and their connection was quickly a lot deeper than what was being communicated to me. i found out that the other person has split up with their partner of three years because of how intense their relationship was. this all happened in about 3 weeks.

im distraught. it takes ages for my partner to listen to me. i miss my period that month due to the stress. finally we decide to be monogamous again, much to the dismay of my partner. i found out later they were really upset by it.

im a mess, still am. but i really thought we were working on it. we had a lovely weekend together recently, and i thought things were getting better.

but i was venting about this all to some mutual friends last night. they all told me to leave. they said some terrible things about my partner, which shocked me because these people are more their friends than mine.

one of the people there was someone who'd had a past FWB with my partner. this was years ago. apparently a few months back they went for coffee and my partner had told them they still had lingering feelings for them, and sometimes felt jealous when they saw her with her boyfriend.

i really wish i hadn't known that. i got really upset and left abruptly, my partner and i had a huge fight last night. and we might break up i don't know. im a bit upset with that friend because i don't think it was appropriate for them to bring that up after id already talked about all these insecurities. it felt a little mean and pointed actually.

anyway. im reluctant to completely give up because up until a few months ago this was a wonderful relationship. but i feel like after all this it's almost expected of me. im at a loss. i know reddit is going to tell me to break it off as reddit always does. im just a mess. i know we can probably work it out but i also know it will never be the same. and i don't know if i can live with that. i genuinely don't know how to move forward.",0,1757677665.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.4,False

At this point i’m worried I’m coming off a bit desperate and I’m wondering if she is just really shy, or maybe I’m not her usual type and she has reservations about approaching me? I’m pretty confident and outspoken too, so I don’t know if I’m just too intimidating?

For context, I smile at her when we talk, and often hold eye contact for at least 2 seconds (and she does the same back) and I’ve been the one to initiate about half(!) our conversations - I’ve asked about her recent trips abroad and some of her hobbies, even some general small talk - so I’ve hardly been hiding my interest.

She has done the same with me too - one time I even asked me for some help with something on my laptop and I was chatty and friendly with her, played with my hair - the usual signals, and she seemed to be really into it (talking and laughing etc), but then she said needed to nip to the toilet (I thought I “overwhelmed” her with all the attention I was giving), but when she came back, it was like she ignored all the tension I created and started being distant (she had an important work phone call that seemed really stressful, but it’s like she didn’t even notice I existed, looking at her screen, barely looking at me and mainly talking about work).

Another time I even bought her her favourite coffee and told her it was a special reward for getting me coffee every morning, and she seemed super appreciative - I mentioned a new coffee place opening on the weekend - like couldn’t have set her up better to ask me out for a coffee sometime, but she just didn’t take the opportunity for some reason.

I don’t know what to do about this hot and cold behaviour and starting to question if she is even into me or just enjoying all the free attention I’ve been giving her. Especially considering she asked me out about a year ago - I said no at the time, but I had some things going with family, and some intense stuff with a couple of other women I was seeing (obviously I didn’t tell her any of that), but now I’m actually interested and made all this effort, why hasn’t she tried again?

One of the coolest and most effortless ways to show your love for anime is by rocking anime graphic T-shirts. These tees are more than just pieces of fabric with colorful prints—they're personal billboards of passion, identity, and style.

First off, anime graphic tees are conversation starters. Whether you're grabbing coffee, at a convention, or just walking down the street, wearing a tee with your favorite anime character or scene instantly connects you with fellow fans. There's something powerful about recognizing someone else who loves the same show as you do. It's like an unspoken bond—your shirt says, ""Hey, I get it.""

Second, these tees allow you to express your individuality in a world of mass-produced fashion. While fast fashion can feel repetitive and impersonal, anime tees reflect your personal taste. Are you a fan of dark, mysterious anti-heroes? Or maybe you prefer light-hearted, feel-good series? Either way, there’s an anime T-shirt out there that captures your vibe. You can go loud and bold or minimalist and subtle—whatever fits your mood or style.

Then there's the design aspect. Anime artwork is vibrant, detailed, and emotionally powerful. When printed on a high-quality shirt, those designs come alive, turning a simple outfit into a bold fashion statement. These shirts don’t just look good—they tell stories. Every character, symbol, or quote on your tee adds depth and meaning to your look, making it stand out in the crowd.

**Anime Graphic Tees** have a unique versatility too. You can dress them up with a blazer or leather jacket, or keep it casual with jeans and sneakers. They fit every season and every setting, from school and hangouts to concerts and chill weekends. Plus, they age well—each wear gives them more character, like a favorite old manga volume.

In the end, anime graphic T-shirts are more than just trendy clothing—they’re wearable art that connects, empowers, and expresses. Whether you're an OG anime fan or just discovering the world of anime, these tees let you wear your fandom proudly and stylishly.",1,1757676673.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1nf0ltz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nf0ltz/reveal_if_poopourri_toilet_spray_really_beats/,Reveal if Poo-Pourri Toilet Spray Really Beats Bathroom Odors,"Poo-Pourri has always intrigued me with its bold promises and quirky marketing, so when I got my hands on the Poo-Pourri AZ9076 toilet spray, I couldn’t wait to see (and smell) if it lived up to the hype. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s genuinely created for people who’d rather not leave their bathroom visits as a souvenir for everyone else. With its Fresh Sea Salt scent, enriched by bergamot and eucalyptus essential oils, this product seemed almost too good to be true. 

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the tiny, travel-friendly size. At 6.02 x 2.36 x 1.06 inches, this 4oz bottle is sleek, lightweight, and easy to throw into a bag—no need to sacrifice your olfactory dignity even on the go. The spray mechanism functions smoothly; you can tell it's built with durability in mind. A single press gives off a fine mist without clogging or dripping—important for something you might use daily. Plus, I appreciated the subtle, minimalistic design of the bottle; it doesn’t scream “bathroom product” if left out around guests.

**Scent Experience and Performance**  
It’s hard to go wrong with a blend of sea salt, bergamot, and eucalyptus, and Poo-Pourri nailed it. The scent feels invigorating but not overpowering, creating a clean and crisp aura in the bathroom. Shake the bottle well, spray three to five times onto the water surface in the toilet, and voilà! The product instantly forms an odor-trapping barrier that ensures nothing escapes into the air. I tested this during my morning coffee ritual (you know what I mean), and the difference was almost magical. It didn’t just mask odors but made it seem like nothing ever happened. Oh, and it’s not just for toilets! Spraying it into trash bins, laundry baskets, and even diaper pails worked wonders to neutralize tough smells.

[Grab Poo-Pourri AZ9076 at the best price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b096hdx4wl/)

**Good Points**  
- Natural essential oil formula, which means no harsh chemicals, parabens, or phthalates.  
- Compact size, making it perfect for travel or smaller bathrooms.  
- Versatility—it’s not limited to just the toilet and can tackle odors in other smelly areas of the house.  
- Long-lasting bottle with up to 200 uses per 4oz size.  
- Cruelty-free formula certified by Leaping Bunny.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The scent, while pleasant, might not appeal to everyone if you’re not into the slightly herbal notes of eucalyptus.  
- Not suitable for extra-large bathrooms where you might want a more prominent, lingering smell.  
- A bit pricier compared to standard room sprays, though it does perform at a higher level.

**Competing Brands**  
In a world of odor-neutralizing products, Poo-Pourri AZ9076 faces stiff competition. Fellow essentials like Febreze or Glade sprays are good for general air-freshening purposes and are available at a lower cost. However, these alternatives are more about masking odors than proactively stopping them at their source. What sets Poo-Pourri apart is its unique before-use approach, which genuinely prevents unwanted smells from spreading. On the flip side, brands like Air Wick tend to have a wider range of scents, so if variety matters more to you, that’s something to consider. That said, if performance outweighs other factors for you, the Poo-Pourri spray easily lands on top.

**Price Performance**  
The price isn’t the most ‘budget-friendly,’ but after using it multiple times, I genuinely feel like you’re paying for premium functionality. The 4oz size promises up to 200 uses, which translates to a long shelf life even with regular use. When compared to how many times you’d replace a standard aerosol spray, this one might actually prove to be cost-effective in the long run. However, your mileage may vary depending on how often you use it—and perhaps how much fiber you have in your diet.

I was doing some research on why iron supplements sometimes don't seem to work as well as they should, and I found some info that was a game-changer for me. I figured I'd share it here since I know a lot of people supplement with iron.

The biggest mistake many of us make is taking our iron pill with our morning coffee, tea, or in a smoothie with milk or yogurt. It turns out, this is one of the worst things you can do.

The calcium in dairy and compounds called ""tannins"" in coffee/tea act as major ""blockers"" and can prevent your body from actually absorbing a huge percentage of the iron.

The simple, doctor-recommended fix is to:

1. **Pair it with Vitamin C.** A small glass of orange juice helps your body absorb the iron much more effectively.
2. **Time it right.** You need to wait at least **1-2 hours** *before or after* having any dairy, coffee, or tea to take your iron pill.

It's a small change but it can be the difference between the supplement working or not. **I learned most of this from a really clear guide that breaks down the science. It was super helpful for me, so I'll leave the link for anyone who wants to go deeper.** Hope this helps someone out!

I thought the route was excellent, the STF huts system is outstanding, and the staff at them were so helpful. I was a bit faster than I thought, but I did stop to smell the Alpine Gentian!

All in \~425 km hiking with a few other summits and side quests off the trail itself. 11 days total, with 10 days hiking with one zero day at Kvikkjokk.

I absolutely fell in love with Sweden and the north and am thinking about doing the route again in winter with a pulk. Also seriously want to go back to Sarek and have my eye on The Arctic Trail (Nordkalottleden).

And the route I took - [https://caltopo.com/m/L7C6016](https://caltopo.com/m/L7C6016)

I wanted to thank everyone who commented on my original post when I was planning the trip, especially with regards to boats, busses, trains and timings! Also the tip about Durlings Led was golden, this was a massive highlight of the journey as I didn't see a soul from leaving the Kungsleden to rejoining it the next day - it felt like a proper adventure. 

\--

Day 1 - Abisko to Tjäktja - 37km.

​I left Abisko at about 5:30 am to begin the trail. The route immediately led me through beautiful woodland as I departed Abisko, a serene, quiet, start before the landscape began to open up.

Following the trail south, the path gradually climbed towards Gárddenvárri, which I took a quick detour to summit - it offered expansive views of the denser trees behind and the open plateau and lakes ahead. I also stopped here to gather some of the biggest sweetest bilberries I've ever seen. They call them Blueberries here - but they are the same Vaccinium myrtillus I know and love. Really delicious!

Around here I had my first truly magical moment on the trail - a magnificent herd of reindeer, grazing peacefully by the lake. They broke and ran when they saw me but it was truly incredible to witness these iconic creatures in their natural habitat

The next section was stunning walk through the valley towards Alesjaure, with the trail hugging the lake for a long stretch. ​I stopped for lunch at the STF Alesjaure Mountain Cabin, a welcome break and a chance to rest my legs amidst the vast, open fells. Refreshed, fed and watered, I continued southwest trekking towards Miesákjávri.

From there, I pushed on towards the STF Tjäktja Mountain Cabin. I decided to camp about 1 km south of here just before the elevation started to gain again. I could see quite a bit of snow higher up and figured staying a bit lower was probably prudent.

\--

Day 2 - Tjäktja to top of Durlings Led (with an attempted summit of Kebnekaise) - 39km.

Day two got off to a frosty start. I was packed up and set off by 5:30 am and quickly made my way up and over the Tjäktja pass, the highest point on the official Kungsleden route. The views from the top were absolutely breathtaking, with a wild, rugged expanse of snow and jagged peaks stretching out in every direction.

After a long descent through the valley, I followed the trail towards Sálka, a scenic stretch of trekking through a dramatic, glacially-carved landscape. I stopped for a quick break and some lunch at the STF Sálka Mountain Cabin, a peaceful spot before the long afternoon push.

After leaving Sálka, I trekked south towards Singi, taking in the views of the massive glaciers and surrounding peaks, including the formidable Kebnekaise. I turned east onto Durlings Led, beginning the approach to what I hoped would be a summit of Sweden's highest peak. I made it to the top of Durlings Led before deciding to set up camp for the night.

Here I made a push to summit but unfortunately the weather was starting to turn, rain and flurries of snow. With steep elevation ahead up ice and snow, and a couple of hours of daylight left I decided to head back to camp and go again first thing in the morning.

\--

Day 3 - Durlings Led to Kaitumjaure (via Kebnekaise) - 38km.

Day 3 began with a frosty start from my camp on Durlings Led. The tent was iced over on the inside with the condensation frozen solid! The main goal for the day was to summit Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain, and then get back to the Kungsleden.

The climb was a moderately challenging scramble over large boulders and scree, especially with the fresh snow. My microspikes and poles were a lifesaver. I stopped for a coffee at the old emergency hut, soaking in the views before pushing on to the glacier section and eventually the summit.

The views from the top were simply breathtaking. I lingered for about 45 minutes, taking photos and even getting some drone footage before the cold set in.

The descent itself was fairly tough. I retraced my steps back to the saddle, but then followed an unmarked route down the waterfall to Šiellajohka and back to the main Kungsleden trail. It was a challenging, sketchy route, but the sense of accomplishment made it worthwhile.

Rejoining the main trail, I pushed south to Singi for a quick refuel, then on to Kaitumjaure. I set up camp near the beautiful lake and mountain hut. Truly an unforgettable day.

\--

Day 4 - Kaitumjaure to Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin - 65km (32 km hiking / 2.5 km rowing / 29 km bus / 2km boat).

​The day began with a beautiful hike from Kaitumjaure, leading to the rowing boats at Teusajaure. The rowing was a workout - I had to row across, bring a second boat back, and then row across again to complete the crossing and ensure a boat was left on each side. A true Kungsleden rite of passage!

​Once across, the hike to the STF Vakkotavare cabin was a pleasant one, it was great to watch the stoats snuffling around for their breakfast amongst the rocks along the way. Once at the road I was grateful to hop on the bus - almost everyone does this as it is 29 km with no siding. It was also a nice break for the legs, and great to chat with a few other hikers and locals. We even stopped at a little cafe for refreshments, which was a lovely surprise.

​A short boat ride took me to STF Saltoluokta, where I was incredibly lucky to bump into someone I knew who I'd met on Te Araroa in New Zealand and it was so lovely to catch up and swap information about the trail ahead. I also took the opportunity to recharge my phone and battery, which was super useful.

​Fully recharged with fresh legs, I took on the final 10 km of the day, with the evening light setting over the stunning landscape as I made my way to the Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin.

A really varied day on the trail - waiting for busses and boats slowed me down, but the beautiful scenery and the chance encounter with a friendly face made it all worth it.

\--

Day 5 - Autsutjvagge to Aktse (via Skierffe) - 36 km (4 km by boat).

​The day began with an early morning hike from the Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin to Sitojaure. Here, I took a beautiful 4 km boat trip across Gasskajávrre and Gåbddåjávrre, with a lovely Sami woman named Anna. Her and her family were just unbelievably kind, honest, and wholesome folk. It was such a pleasure to chat with her about nature and the landscape of Lapland.

​After crossing, the main event was the detour to summit Skierffe. The climb was actually fairly steep, but the panoramic view from the top was absolutely worth it. The famous view of the Rapaälven delta winding its way through the valley of Rapadalen was simply unforgettable - a majestic sight of a wild and untouched landscape. I lingered for perhaps too long, just soaking it all in, truth be told it was quite hard to leave - but the weather was rolling in and some bruising storm clouds threatened rain.

​From the summit I made my descent and continued the trek toward Aktse. As the day drew to a close, a beautiful red leaf along the path was a small reminder that autumn was beginning to paint the landscape. The tips of the birch trees have begun to turn a golden yellow, and there is a definite chill in the air.

I camped at the STF site at Aktse, ready to take the boat in the morning. I got my tent up just in time as the heavens opened. It rained really hard all night!

\--

Day 6 - Aktse to Kvikkjokk - 40 km (3 km by boat).

The morning started slowly from Aktse as I had to wait for the boat at 9 am. It had rained all night and started raining hard again as we waited. I met a couple of really nice guys (who both also had Atom Packs!) and it was great to chat with them; it really helped to take our minds off the weather.

The boat ride across the lake was short, but by the end I was shivering with the cold. I also felt rather queasy and desperately needed the toilet. I was so thankful when we finally docked and I could get off. I quickly made my way to the Mallenjarka emergency shelter for a break to make a hot drink and eat something.

After the rain had calmed down and I was feeling a bit better, I pushed on. The trail from here was long but relatively flat, a welcome change after the last few days. Lots of board walks through lush birch forest.

I ended up hiking with the two guys I'd met on the boat, Chris and Christian. The miles flew by as we yapped away, so much so that we went a little off-track towards the end and came down just east of the trail on the outskirts of Kvikkjokk!

When we finally made it, I decided to stay at the STF station. I had a shared room with a group of three really nice French guys going north and another really nice French guy going south - it was lovely to chat with them all about life, hiking, watches, AI, and everything in-between.

The station also had a cancellation, so I booked a private room to take a zero the next day. The offer of laundry, hot showers, and proper food was too much to pass up! It was a long day, especially with the tough start, but reaching Kvikkjokk was a great milestone to reach.

\--

Day 7 - STF Kvikkjokk - 0 km

​What a perfect zero day! The STF Kvikkjokk Mountain Station was an amazing place to rest and recharge. I was lucky to get a private room with a lovely view out over the river. The facilities are superb, and the opportunity to do laundry, take a long hot shower, and recharge my phone and battery was too good to pass up.

​I spent quite some time exploring the common areas. The library was particularly interesting, with a selection of old maps, books, and fascinating traditional gear on display. I also loved the beautiful posters showing all the different wildflowers you might see on the trail.

​The restaurant was also a major highlight. I had a delicious breakfast buffet; porridge, fresh fruit, homemade bread, and copious amounts of coffee. The real treat though was dinner. I had an incredible locally sourced reindeer thigh with lingonberry, followed by vanilla ice cream with warm cloudberries. It was a perfect change from dehydrated meals and energy bars. The views over the Kamajokk rapids and the mountains in Tarradalen were a fantastic backdrop to it all.

The staff too couldn't be more helpful, really genuinely lovely people who were so knowledgeable about the local geography, flora and fauna. The stay here really left me ​feeling fully rested and recharged.

\--

Day 8 - Kvikkjokk to Tjäurakåtan hut - 51 km (3 km by boat).

The day began with a stroll around the village of Kvikkjokk, admiring the traditional buildings and the beautiful wooden church before my 9 am boat ride.

My ride across the lake was with a lovely Sami woman named Helena. The other Sami woman I'd met earlier on the trail, Anna, had asked me to pass on her regards. When I said to Helena, ""Anna says hello"" her face lit up with a beautiful smile. She told me how Anna is such a lovely woman and never fails to ask travellers to pass on her regards. It was such a simple, beautiful thing.

Once on the other side of the lake, the trail felt very cruisey and the kilometers ticked off as I passed through the ever-changing landscape now painted in vibrant autumn colors. The wildlife changed too, with frogs, toads, and lizards joining the trailside foliage.

I hiked for some time with a lovely German guy who was also going SOBO, it was great to chat with him about computer science and AI as we stopped for lunch at the emergency shelter by the Tsielekjahka river.

After lunch I pushed on up and over the range and down towards the Piteälven lake and up the other side of the valley. As the sun began to set, the sky turned to a magnificent array of pink and purple as I reached the tiny, traditional Goahti/kåta Tjäurakåtan hut high on the plateau. Unfortunately, I found a fair bit of litter inside - dehydrated meal packets, wrappers, and other waste. I decided to pack it all into my bag to take to the next proper bin.

The fact that hikers would leave litter all the way up here in a traditional building really saddened me. It was such a contrast to the joy I'd felt in the morning relaying Anna's regards to Helena. People can be amazing...but it's rare and should be cherished when it is found. With the light failing and the Goahtil all clean, I decided to stay in it for the night.

\--

Day 9 - Tjäurakåtan hut (Pieljekaise summit) to Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin - 64km (7km by boat).

I was up early from the goahti as I had 21 km to do to make the boat at Vuonatjviken for 9 am. There is only one crossing per day across lake Riebnes. Suffice to say I made it in time but only just, and I was the last one on board!

Once across I stopped to make breakfast and hot coffee on the Southern shore. The hike from here was through birch forest passing various lakes, it was really easy going and a nice change to some of the earlier forest sections that were a bit more technical. I took another break by the shore of lake Hávggajávrre and found an amazing Reindeer antler. I'd already picked one up a few days ago - but this one was perfect, so I left the one I'd been carrying and packed the new one out.

There was another short rowing section at lake Harrselet - again with only one boat - here I met a lovely French couple who were about to cross so I jumped in the boat with them. Very kindly they offered to row, and the guy even collected a second boat and rowed it back - such a good man!

Saying goodbye to them I headed down towards the mountain hamlet of Jäckvik, most people I'd talked to planned to take a zero here as the weather was meant to be awful the next day. There is a large ICA supermarket here so I took the opportunity to resupply a few bits and to recharge my phone.

Leaving Jäckvik the route climbed steadily to the Allmän Rest Cabin, it was raining quite hard by this point so I popped inside to take a break. It was beautiful inside and immaculately clean. As the rain eased I pushed on taking a detour to summit Pieljekaise. This was a bit foolish as it was a mud bath, and by the time I reached the top the rain really began to hammer down again.

Quickly descending I followed the trail down to the Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin. By the time I reached it I was drenched. I decided to stay here and bedded down with a nice German guy from Berlin heading north.

\--

Day 10 - Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin to Juovatvaretje Rest cabin - 101km.

I was up super early from Pieljekaisestugan setting out a little before 4 am. I had a plan to finish the trail today as it was exactly 100 mi/161km to the end. Obviously completing 100 mi in 24h is a huge test both physically and mentally - but it's something I've done before - and I knew if I felt good at this point it was something I wanted to go for.

The first section was super easy going down into Adolfsström with a large section of it on a dirt road. Here there was a tiny cafe - which was closed - but the owner's mother was about and offered me some fresh from the oven croissants, which I wolfed down. The shop/cafe was awesome and I would have loved to stay longer but had to push on.

The next section was to Ammarnäs about 59 km. The route up the mountain was very gradual, I didn't really feel the incline but on the tops the weather turned again, raining quite hard with a fair headwind and a thick mist. With very low visibility I dropped down early at Gieråjvvie into Norra Ammarnäs.

At Ammarnäs I grabbed some snacks from the shop and then headed out across the river and up the valley side. There was a huge white reindeer on the path here that ran with me for about a km, best pacer in the world!

At the top I took a break at the STF cabin at Ruovdatjjávrátje for some hot tea and a change of socks. Leaving the cabin the weather really doubled down - high wind and rain, strong enough to buffet me about. As I reached Lill-Aigert the fog was so thick I couldn't see the markers, and I realised that going much further in these conditions was a bit silly.

A little disheartened I made a final push for the rest cabin on the Southern flank of Stuor-Ájgart and called it a day. In the end I did a smidge over 101 km in 17.5 hours averaging \~5.8 kmph - so not too shabby at all.

There was a lovely Sami woman at the hut as well as a nice Aussie bloke. They were settled in when I arrived so I just got my head down on the cabin floor ready to finish tomorrow. Gutted I didn't make the 100 miles but hey ho.

\--

Day 11 - Juovatvaretje Rest cabin to Hemavan - 39km.

The final day started with a glorious sunrise as I left the hut at about 5:30 am. Thankfully, the wind, rain, and fog from the previous evening had fully cleared. I made my way steadily down towards lake Servvejávrrie to a huge cloud inversion, with the distant mountains painted pink with the morning light.

The route from the lake was really easy-going, and before long, I reached STF Tärnasjö where I stopped for an early lunch and to soak my feet. From here, the trail followed the eastern shore of Lake Tärnasjön, and it was beautiful to watch the dragonflies darting about the shoreline. I had to be quite careful as they liked to sun themselves on the boardwalks, and I really didn't want to step on them.

Towards the southern end of the lake, I took the 5 bridges across to the western side and carried on down between Sjul-Olsaxeln and Vuekienaesie into the steep-sided valley. I stopped to take a break and make a hot drink at the Syterskal Rastskydd before carrying on down the valley.

As I reached the STF Viterskalet Mountain Lodge I popped in to grab some chocolate and use the long drop. The couple staffing it were absolutely lovely giving me homemade lemonade and even filling my softflask with it before I headed off! This is the last, or first for NOBOs, STF hut on the trail.

The final 10km was also a steady downhill stretch past the ski lifts down to Hemavan. By this stage my legs were tired but the thought of finishing put a spring in my step. In the end I finished a little before 8pm, but decided to head back up the hill to camp in the woods that evening as I figured it was a bit late to head to the STF Hemavan Mountain station itself.

It felt great to complete the trail, it's a truly beautiful route. The STF huts and staff were amazing.",2,1757676025.0,Kungsleden,1,1.0,False

My forst encounter was a guy who asked me whether I am Tamilan and then he told me that his mom was in a hospital and he needed money for food. So I bave Rm5 cash in my wallet and with my generosity, I gave him. He mignt have seen my other Rm 10 in my wallet and asked me why cant I give him the Rm10 , I said I am using it. Then after giving the money he left and he out the money in his pocket. Probably I soon assumed that he bought alcohol right after and lied to me. Then few weeks later that same guy asked me again but this time it was in the train station, and he told me the same old shitty story, and i laughed and ignored him. All fun and games until today, a different guy walked towards me and he was creepy as fuck. He saw me buying coffee in 7 eleven and waited for me to sit down. After I sat and minding my own business, this guy asked whether I am tamilan and how I came here. I was scared to shit and this guy was harassing me to give money for food. I told that I only use tng and I got no cash with me. He soon told me whether ri could transfer money in tng or not. Then I ignore it left sat somewhere else. He soon leave there too.

From the beginning I told him that I want something serious and not to be strung along.

A few days ago we met for coffee and I told him I was upset with his behavior – sometimes he goes days without texting, and it hurts me because even when busy, it only takes 5 seconds to say “I’m not okay, we’ll talk tomorrow.” 

He told me: “I’m not good, I have problems, and right now I don’t feel like having contact with anyone.” He also said: “I can’t be a good boyfriend right now.” He explained that he might have to move, has family issues, isn’t sure where he’ll be by the end of the year (maybe even returning to Bosnia), and a business plan he had isn’t working out.

And yet… while saying this, he hugged me, kissed me, and looked at me in a way that felt like he really cared. He said he is “bad at this” and asked me to give him a little more time – specifically, 2 days while in Bosnia to rest, think, and then give me a clear answer.

I told him he already had 5 months, but if those 2 days really matter to him, I’ll give him that. Again, he hugged and kissed me and promised to text when he arrived. He did text when he got there. Now I’m just waiting.

I truly care about him. I even told him I’m willing to be patient if he genuinely wants me, but I don’t want to be strung along anymore.

Men, if you were in his shoes – what would make you hesitate after 5 months? And should I wait for his answer, or take his uncertainty as the answer already?

TL;DR: Been seeing a guy for 5 months. I want serious, he says he “can’t be a good boyfriend right now” because of problems, but he hugged/kissed me and asked for 2 more days to think and give me a clear answer.

Freak but whatever your still weak to even think"" both other foxes remark before beating up miles but miles let it happen.. after all he was a freak right...? Later that day miles went back home as cops were there while investigating the incident of miles parents as miles was stopped by an officer ""hey kid..."" the officer mumbled ""a 2 tailed fox. Ew"" the officer explains to miles what happened to his family as miles just looks more... done with life (tired) ""oh.... i see... where do I life now..?"" Miles asked ""well we don't know there aren't any orphanage close by until a few days away.. so we'll let you stay at this home"" the officer said as miles sighs... time skip a few weeks Miles was alone talking to himself, eating any food left as he was sitting on the couch as he hears a sound from the door and walks over and opens it to see the land lord ""hey kid where's your mom or dad"" the owner of the house said sounding mad, ""they're died..."" miles replied ""I see... well I asked for your family because the rent on this house is due for the last week"" miles sighs as he didn't have any money or currency ""well tough luck kid.. get out"" miles walks to his small room and takes his stuff slowly as he sees the knife he used to kill his family and remembers... there wasn't a murder.. he was the murder miles realizes this as he hears a voice ""you know... you could just kill the owner of the house and make it yours"" miles looks around seeing no one as he picks up the knife as he hears more voices as he remembers how it felt to kill his own family... it felt powerful like he had something for once.. miles stops and walks to the door where the owner was still holding the bloody knife ""oh took you long enough-"" miles stabs the owner in the heart as he kept stabbing as the owner screams as miles kept stabbing until there was no screams as he slows down on the stabbing.. miles felt powerful for once... he looks down at the bloody and dead body of the owner blood spilling everywhere, he's heart exposed and rips broken miles drags the body inside as he drops it into the bathtub and cleans any blood remains as miles hears the voices cheer for him as he felt.. useful for once ""I-is... this right..?"" Miles asked to himself as he continued cleaning the mess and goes to sleep in his sleep miles relive the moment he killed his mother.. his father, and the owner as he felt happy ripping out there flesh and bones slowly hearing there screams, later miles would wake up feeling happy, miles got up and held the knife still the blood remains on there as he walked into the kitchen.. but there wasn't Any food left, miles was hungry and considered eating the dead body but shakes it off ""that would taste gross..."" miles hides the knife against his fur as he walks out as he was close to his breaking point, ""HEY FREAK!"" Miles felt a sharp pain against his back as he turns around and sees his bullies and he runs as he make it to Greenhill at a darken corner ""heh you really thought you could get away?"" One of the bullies remarked as they start walking to miles but miles stares at them.. he had enough miles pulls out the knife and jumps to the main bully stabbing the hell out of his lungs as the other bully states in horror and fear as miles rips off flesh and starts eating it not giving a care because he has been starving for over a week ""y-you..."" the other bully states ""S-SOMEONE!-"" he didn't get to finish his words as miles kills him too.. meanwhile.... sonic was running around happy he saved the day as he hears a loud scream ""huh? What the"" sonic runs over and jumps down and stops breathing seeing the scene before him.. a two tailed fox was ripping out bones and flesh while eating some of the flesh the guts and bones were covering the small area ""W-what the.."" sonic muttered as the two tailed fox stops eating and looks at sonic with the knife he used... both stared at one another





knowing a friend:  


Sonic stares at the 2 tailed fox who had blood dripping out of his mouth from the dead body's ""you.."" sonic felt a strong urge as he dodges a knife swipe that probably would've cut off his head. Sonic looks down at his arm for a moment blood was leaking out and the 2 tailed fox stares at him with more madness, sonic kept dodging not wanting to hurt the kid but he knows he has to sonic waits until the fox slows down as he gets behide him and knocks him out the knife clattering to the floor... ""huff... geez for a kid he sure has a lot of energy"" sonic mutters to no one in particular as he drags the kid away from the scene and the knife too... Miles/tails pov: I stared at the blue hedgehog.. he looked scared, but didn't quiver even a moment.. I found it interesting. I could still feel the taste of their flesh but I know I needed to kill the hedgehog before he would run and tell someone the hedgehog was going to say something but all I heard ""you"" coming from him but I rushed in without a waste of a moment as I try to stab him but failed but at least stabbed a hole into his arm, I kept slashing and chasing after him he was surprisingly fast.. after awhile I was getting tired.. more then ever then in felt a sharp pain in the back of my head as everything slowly went black... no ones pov: sonic makes it to his workshop as he puts the 2 tailed fox down on a couch with strains, sonic sighs as he walks into a back room and cleans the blood and wound from the knife ""geez.. if I didn't dodged that I would've been dead"" sonic muddera in credulously as he bandages himself and calls a certain echidna... knuckles pov (and I said it before sonic met knuckles sooner in this timeline though they aren't best buds but friends in the end): I was just on angel island guarding the master as usual I was.. surprising bored until I heard my phone ring as I pulled it out and saw it was sonic and I thought to myself 'what could that hedgehog need now?' He thought in his mind. As he picks up ""hello sonic..."", ""hey knuckles can I asked you a question?"" I didn't reply as sonic kept talking ""so.. hypothetically if I kidnap a kid who tired to murder me and ate other mobian's what would you do?"" I stopped processing what the fuck sonic just said ""excuse me... but what the fuck did you just asked me?"" I could hear sonic choke on his own air, typical ""okay knuckles let's say hypothetically I kidnapped a kid and he was a murder and a cannibal what would you do?"" I sigh as I rub my head as I know sonic has to have committed another felony ""sonic... did you kidnap a kid?"" I could hear sonic breathing as he I can tell the next words he was gonna say were a lie ""n-no knuckles come on buddy.. I would never kidnap a kid-"" ""cut the lies sonic I can tell your lying to me.."" sonic sighs over the phone ""okay fine I did kidnap a kid but i couldn't let him alone he might kill someone again"" I sigh as I was slowly getting an aneurism ""sonic.. just ugh... make sure you don't die and my advice is to see if the kid is even savable anyways I have to go back to making sure the master save"" I hung up as I go back to my duty... Sonic's pov: I sigh as knuckles hung up as I walked out of the bathroom and see the kid out of his restraint somehow and staring at my plane (the tornado), I stared at the kid as he wasn't looking at me as I quietly get closer but failed miserably, the kid snapped his neck to face me as I didn't move an inch until I was grabbed and being choked by the fox ""h-hey..."" I coughed out as he kept choking me while staring into my eyes ""where is my knife..."" I weakly point to the back room as he drops me and runs towards the back room as I coughed 'geez... this kid even weak and malnourished still has a lot of strength' I thought to myself as I see the kid walk out of the back room holding the knife again as he looked... calmer.. ""hey kid... what's your name?"" I asked as he stared at me Miles/tails pov: I stare at the hedgehog as he asked me for my name... I didn't want to be miles... ""tails.. that's my name hedgehog..""



  
side part:

  
Many weeks later sonic was able to MOSTLY keep ""tails"" in check, though ofc sometimes sonic would look away and see tails chewing an innocent person and one day he left to get a new phone and at the worst time, a certain echidna had to visit... Knuckles pov: I have been worried about sonic for the past week he hasn't picked up his phone... ""damnit i'ma go visit him"" I use the master emerald teleport to his workshop as I walked in I saw a yellow 2 tailed fox who tense up, I hold my hands up as in a way to show that I'm not here to try to hurt him ""hey kid... have you seen a blue hedgehog...?"" I asked as I start to remember the call From 2 weeks ago about sonic (hypothetical)question ""oh... so your the kid that sonic kidnapped?"" I instinctively dodged to the right as a knife worlpassed where I was standing, I get in my normal fighting position as the kid starts to attack me rapidly as I was surprised that the kid had a lot of speed, Tails pov: I was staring at a red echidna that walked in he asked about sonic.. I dislike him already... ""oh wait your the kid sonic kidnapped..?"" I hiss as I thrown my knife at him as the echidna dodges... I WANTED him DIED for him to think that I was kidnapped.. I start rushing at him but he block perfect though I couldn't care as I eventually just kicked him right in the testicles as the echidna drops the floor ""AGHH... YOU BITCH-"" I start snapping his bones as I enjoyed myself... knuckles pov: I was getting tired but I kept fighting knowing this kid is a fucking lunatic but I wasn't expecting the kid to hit me right the testicles.. I felt so weak.. but I didn't give up yet, but he snapped my legs.. my arms.. all I could do was not scream, so the kid couldn't get any satisfaction.... I just hope sonic could be here soon... no one's pov.... later that day sonic walks into the workshop and stops seeing tails with knuckles severed arm in his mouth ""tails..."" ""sonic...."", ""tails where's the body...?"" Tails points to the back room as sonic walks in to see knuckles bloody, broken bones in a corner and with a severed arm, sonic sighs as he drags knuckles into the main room as sonic sees tails tensing up again ""tails don't hurt him anymore.. he's a friend of mine..."" tails stops almost immediately as he sighs and spits out the arm he was chewing... meanwhile in a lab/base a certain moustache man was watching everything though cameras ""OHOHO that hedgehog has a new friend? That attacks others? He could be useful for my world domination plans... issue is he looks very unstable.. whatever my future plans shall continue anyways... not like it matters.."" later in life Eggman would regret not killing the fox sooner, but at the moment Eggman gets up from the camera room and walks over to his newest creation... ""metal sonic... you shall be the key to my world domination.."" Eggman hits a button as the chamber said two days left before he can finally use his greatest creation... Eggman laughs with pure madness his hatred for that hedgehog growing more and more... eggman hears his signals go crazy as he walks over and stares at some stones... ""time stones eh? Sounds very powerful... if I can get my hands on those I defeat that hedgehog easily.. though it's on little planet... i'm over 3000 miles away from there.. whatever.. BADNIKS Start making a base at Little planet pronto"" the badniks leave as Eggman sighs while grabbing coffee And plots every way to murder sonic... back with the main characters lol sonic pov: ""and that how I meet knuckles"" I said proudly until I look at my right and see tails fucking asleep while drooling and to my left knuckles is watching some Minecraft fucking video and snoring, I bang my head against the wall as I sob to myself and sleep on the cold the couch... the next morning I got up and heard about Eggman's plan after he tried to sneak attack me again.. as I walk to my tracker and input everything ""little planet huh..? Welp I gota save the day"" I run off forgetting about tails...  
Tails pov: I wake up as I slightly remembered about sonic yapping about something knuckles.. I look around and see no one... no Knuckles or sonic as I stare at a computer monitor... ""little planet.. time stones..."" I saw that the tornado was still here.. I grabbed the keys and fly towards little planet to find and help sonic.. and maybe murder... no one pov: thus this takes us to the events of sonic CD ALSO Bonus: earlier that morning sonic helps knuckles and drop him off at angel Island as knuckles heals himself with the master emerald and now has ptsd from tails and dislikes him, tails is canonically unlicense but still using a fucking plane-, sonic is slowly losing his emotions and more depressed, Eggman is slowly losing his mind just wanting to end that hedgehog..







events of cd:

tails jumps into the tornado as he flys remembering how sonic taught him he flys all the way to little planet as before he could think of where to land he gets hit in the head by a pink gem (phantom Ruby) ""what the fuc-"" tails gets teleported as he crashes into the floor of a burning angel Island... ""..."" tails stares at a old looking sonic with an X on his stomach as he was playing chess with a dead looking version of himself ""weird.."" tails walks around trying to find the fucking pink gem as he hears a small sound of a theme as he turns around and sees the old ass sonic fly towards him as tails waits as he kicks the shit out of the old sonic and runs off knowing from that one kick that thing isn't killable... yet as he gets cut off by the old wrinkly sonic as tails get slapped the shit out of him as he crashed into a hill and sees the pink gem as he grabs it and get teleported away.... lord X pov: I slapped that damn fox as he teleports away.. it irritate me to no end but I just sigh as I walk away about to get back to my chess game until I felt my back give out on me ""shit... I'm too old for this I need a cane"". Meanwhile with sonic, sonic runs past a past sign as he goes back in time and breaks another one of Eggman's badniks generators as he runs it the end and sees Eggman in... a robot with 2 legs that look unstable and 2 arms that had pinballs on them ""Eggman.. what is this?"" ""HOHOHOH SONIC BE READY FOR THIS I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU GET READY TO DI-"" Eggman gets hit by the tornado that crashes right into him as Eggman flys off burnt using his jet pack, sonic sighs as he looks around and sees tails appearing out of a pink portal with a pink gem... meanwhile tails hops out of the portal as he sees the tornado crash into a fat bald man as tails throws away the pink gem as he decide to act like Meeting that other sonic never happened (it will be reference later on) tails jumps down of a cliff and lands on the floor as he sees sonic ""tails why are you here? I told you not to come here..."" ""sonic we both know I would follow you either way and the tornado was an accident... also who was that bald fat guy?"" Sonic sighs as he explains Eggman.. ""Ok... anyways can I join you for this?"" Sonic sighs because he knows tails would not leave him alone and if he says no tails would stab the shit out of him ""fine just promise me you will not slaughter anyone"" ""no promises sonic..."" sonic and tails run by Collision Chaos zone act 1 as sonic sighs as he hears HER again ""SONICCCCC"" tails snaps his neck at the sound with his knife but stops as he stares at a smaller hedgehog that was pink as sonic jumps onto a cliff as the spikes that were in the way break by a metallic thing... a sonic tails and sonic stare at the metal version of sonic as he flys off kidnapping the pink hedgehog ""so... sonic who the hell was that?"" ""Amy rosy (or rose Idfk) she's a fortuneteller and for some reason is infatuated with me.."" ""sounds like a pain..."" ""it is anyways let's get going"" they past by past signs as tails stares at the past as he stabs a few poor badniks as he gets blood on him as sonic grabs him by the scruff of his neck (and yes this tails has scruff at the back of his neck) as they broke the badnik generator as they went back into the future as they past the act and made it to act 3 as tails and sonic stare at a hole ""this doesn't seem like a good way to go... maybe we could-"" tails kicks sonic into the hole as he jumps in as they start bouncing all over the place because of the stupid bounce balls (or whatever the hell they are called) as Eggman drops spike balls as tails just lands and flys up to Eggman and rip out the injector reader of his machine as he trys to fly out but Eggman couldn't ""shit NOT THIS TIME"" Eggman self-destruct the small machine as he flys out and uses his jet pack until tails jumps him as Eggman slaps tails off and gets stabbed as Eggman runs off, sonic climbs out of the bouncy hell hole ""tails stop trying to murder"" tails shrugs as he runs past the sign as sonic joins as they made it to idle Tempest (or something) sonic looks down sweating a bit ""um... t-tails there's too much water maybe we should-"" tails pushes sonic as he sinks in seconds ""...hedgehog..."" tails goes in and helps sonic get past the entire stage and got a time stone... in the next zone of Quartz Quadrant Zone sonic crashes into another wall as tails walks stabbing any badnik that sonic didn't hit as tails and sonic both got a time stone, at the next zone Wacky Workbench Zone- tails grabs sonic and flys over everyone ""no"", stardust runaway zone, sonic would have 5 out of the 7 time stones as he sees the metal man himself metal sonic tails just flys over them as Eggman flys in with a death laser as tails lands on him as both sonic and metal sonic race through stardust runaway zone act 3, Eggman trys throwing tails off of him but tails kept scratching him and eventually knocks the doctor out as he crashes onto the floor as tails runs towards the sonic's as both turn around in two seconds and see tails as sonic speeds up and so does metal as tacos catches up as sonic makes it to the end as tails rips off metal sonic's head ""geez watch out next time tails you could've killed me.."" tails stares at sonic with a bored look ""right....."" sonic turns around and sees Amy with a brown fox (a reference to my one of my friends on discord) sonic points at tails giving him an indication as sonic speeds by as tails frees Amy as she runs towards the sign as tails sighs as he goes too, Metallic Insanity Zone the last one. Sonic jumps over and makes it past the crushing pillar as tails flys over and get shot by the min bee boss thing afterwards Eggman appears in a... robot that strangely looks like a hexagon ""come on Eggman this is your best final weapon???"" ""Yes it is hedgehog now I'll be ready to face the wrath of my final weapon-"" tails throws his knife at it as it breaks off some of its apppens and stabs Eggman around the leg ""NO-"" Amy walks in as sonic grabs her and tails and runs off as base explodes as sonic lands back into Mobius/earth as little planet crashes downwards and explodes thankfully, no one died (a reference to another creepy pasta) a Eggman was on a flying scooter as he laughs having the last time stone as sonic throws a fucking rock and makes it explode as he catches the last time stone.. sonic runs off as tails stares at Amy as tails runs as Amy follows sonic for awhile until later he walks into the workshop as he sees tails waiting for him on the couch with a bag of chips, sonic sits as he still has the time stones and hides them away for now....

bonus... Eggman would crash onto emerald Hills zone as he sees a new chance to conquer at least this island And kill that damn hedgehog, Eggman grabs metal sonic's leftover body and leaves as he starts his plans but someone was watching in the background ""this is intriguing... this timeline is different yet the same story but I know it would last long..."" the man in black watching in the background before he leaves....",1,1757675561.0,u_Divinehatredust,0,1.0,False

1nf0b5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1nf0b5e/can_the_stokk_rv_water_filter_rw036_truly_improve/,Can the Stokk RV Water Filter RW036 Truly Improve Your Water Quality? Review Inside,"Using the Stokk 4895260602806 RV Water Filter daily over the past few weeks has been an enlightening experience. As someone who spends a considerable amount of time on the road in an RV, ensuring access to clean, chlorine-free drinking water has always been a priority. This inline water filter claims to deliver safe, great-tasting water while reducing sediments, chlorine, rust, and odors—all features that seem attractive on paper. Naturally, I had to put it to the test, fully exploring its features, advantages, and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Immediately out of the box, the build quality of this RV water filter made a good first impression. It comes with two water filters and a flexible hose protector. The lead-free, BPA-free design, made from durable food-grade plastic, feels robust and reliable. Each end of the filter is fitted with rust-resistant copper fittings and a silicone washer to ensure a tight, leak-free connection. As a clumsy person, I appreciated the sturdy construction that didn’t feel fragile. Even the flexible hose protector is useful—it reduced stress on connections and prevented water from spraying in odd directions, which was a pet peeve with my previous filters.  

[Looking for Stokk 4895260602806 discounts? Check Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0djr7yc9r/)  

Moving on, I noticed that the filter's compact dimensions (6.3""L x 2.2""W x 10.5""H) fit snugly into my storage compartment when not in use, a detail that mobile homeowners can understand the importance of.  

**Filtration Performance and Safety**  
The NSF/ANSI 42 certification caught my eye initially, as it’s an authoritative standard for filtration performance. This certification ensures that the RV water filter effectively reduces chlorine, heavy metals, odors, and sediments. During a camping trip with less-than-ideal water sources, I could tell the difference when compared to unfiltered water. The taste was noticeably better, and there were no off-putting odors. Even my coffee tasted cleaner, which was a low-key victory for my mornings on the road.  

Its 10-micron sediment filter plays a key role in ensuring crisp drinking water, catching silt and fine impurities most basic filters miss. Premium materials like GAC (granular activated carbon) and KDF (Kinetic Degradation Flux) were also noteworthy; the filter handled heavy-duty cleaning without slowing the water flow significantly. However, if you rely on heavily contaminated water sources often, keep in mind that no filter is invincible—it will need frequent replacement in extreme cases.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this inline water hose filter couldn’t have been simpler. The design is plug-and-play. I connected it to the RV’s standard water line within minutes; the 360-degree swivel prevented the hose from kinking. I've found other inline filters awkward to install without tools or careful alignment, but this one genuinely felt user-friendly. My friend, who’s a gardening enthusiast, borrowed the filter for a week to test it on their water line. They noted how quick and hassle-free it was to connect. No leaks, no fiddling—mission accomplished.  

**Versatility in Usage**  
This isn’t just for RV enthusiasts. During testing, I found this filter highly adaptable, working seamlessly for pools, car washes, and even watering the garden. My elderly parents used it when filling up their backyard pool to reduce chlorine levels, which made the water kinder to sensitive skin. Versatility like this ensures you get double mileage out of your purchase, which feels great. My dog, who’s infamously picky about drinking water, approved of the filtered water bowl too!

**Highlights**  
- Reduces bad taste, chlorine, rust, and odors effectively.  
- Flexible hose and 360-degree swivel prevent kinks or pressure damage.  
- Lead-free, BPA-free materials ensure safe drinking water for humans and pets.  
- Useful across multiple settings like RVs, pools, gardening, and car washes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The filter’s 3-month shelf life is standard, but I wish it lasted longer for full-time RVers like me.  
- While it successfully reduces sediment and odors, don’t expect it to fully purify water from severely contaminated sources.  
- Some may find the wide-body design slightly less compact if compared to slimmer alternatives.  

**Competitive Options**  
Two competitors immediately come to mind: the Camco TastePURE RV Water Filter and the Clear2O RV & Marine Inline Filter. Camco’s option is slightly cheaper and performs decently in taste improvement, but its leak-prone connections have been a constant complaint, which is not ideal for RV travel. On the other hand, the Clear2O model offers even finer filtration, with a small 1-micron filter for extreme water quality. However, its reduced flow rate caused slight frustration during my testing.  

In contrast, the product under review strikes a favorable balance—it’s affordable while delivering reliable mid-level filtration without impacting water pressure or connection stability significantly.  

**Financial Value**  
From a cost–efficiency perspective, this filter is a reasonable investment for anyone seeking mid-tier filtration performance. While not the cheapest, its reliability and adaptable usage justify the price tag. It’s strong enough for RV users who drink filtered water daily while remaining accessible to gardeners or seasonal campers. Plus, the inclusion of two filters in the pack sweetens the deal.

[Australian critical minerals companies head for Washington](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/australian-critical-minerals-companies-head-for-washington/ar-AA1Mp01l?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

[FILE PHOTO: A vehicle moves near the entrance of Trafigura's Nyrstar lead smelting operations in Port Pirie, north of Adelaide, in South Australia, July 4, 2022. REUTERS\/Melanie Burton\/File Photo](https://preview.redd.it/se5p18ytfpof1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef9e7f4680eb570b5f613982294c0e182d157c1)

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -More than 20 Australian critical minerals companies including Trafigura unit Nyrstar will head to the U.S. next week to explore areas for collaboration, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

**The delegation led by the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) will attend meetings in New York and Washington with senior officials from the Trump administration.**

Although sources described the trip as fairly routine, the companies will arrive after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Donald Trump last week spoke about opportunities for critical minerals companies in both countries to co-operate more closely.

Australia has requested a meeting with Trump and Albanese will travel to the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month although no meetings have been announced.

Australia is striving to position itself as a key supplier to Western allies as they build an alternative supply chain to China while the U.S. is readying to deploy funding to build out its battery and defence industries.

# Reuters reported last month that the Trump administration was considering a plan to reallocate at least $2 billion from the CHIPS Act, which supports semiconductor research and chip factory construction, to fund critical minerals projects.

Nyrstar last month won Australian government support to assess the possibility of producing four critical minerals across two aging smelters, including antimony which is used in ammunition and for which China has limited exports. But Nyrstar would need more funds to bring that plan into action.

The meetings were described as a chance to better understand the Trump administration's priorities as well as meet administration officials and build relationships, with some attendees angling for funding opportunities.

Among other miners going are Australia's top lithium producer Pilbara Minerals which largely supplies lithium to China and South Korea, International Graphite, which is building out processing capabilities from its Western Australian graphite mine, and Cobalt Blue, which is developing its Broken Hill cobalt project in New South Wales.

Spokespeople from Pilbara Minerals, International Graphite and Cobalt Blue confirmed that company representatives would be in attendance next week.

The delegation will not include Australia's Trade Minister Don Farrell or Resources Minister Madeleine King. The ministers' offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment on prospects for major announcements.

Australia already has a critical minerals partnership with the United States and under legislation passed in late 2023, Australian mineral deposits qualify as domestic supply for U.S. defence procurement.

[We must break China’s grip on U.S. defense supply chains | News, Sports, Jobs - Salem News](https://www.salemnews.net/opinion/local-columns/2025/09/we-must-break-chinas-grip-on-u-s-defense-supply-chains/)

China’s Xi Jinping appeared supremely confident at a recent military parade in Beijing with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Xi’s assurance likely isn’t just a reflection of China’s growing military might. It’s also that China now holds the U.S. defense industrial base in the palm of its hand.

Xi is well aware that China’s dominance of global mineral supply chains has ensnared both the U.S. economy and America’s military. According to The Wall Street Journal, more than 80,000 parts used in America’s weapons systems are manufactured with critical minerals subject to Chinese control.

Whether it’s fighter jets, drones, munitions, or night vision goggles, China can bring U.S. military production to a standstill simply by denying us the minerals we need.

China’s mineral dominance has been decades in the making. The United States was once a global mining superpower. But extraordinary policy missteps have withered away our industrial base since the end of the Cold War–and put China in the driver’s seat.

A single U.S. weapon can now require hundreds of suppliers in dozens of countries. Although we stockpile some minerals for weapons production, a Chinese embargo would still cripple our military in a matter of months. And as a consequence of the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight, Beijing has already slashed the flow of critical minerals to western defense contractors, increasing our production costs–or halting production altogether.

This is a crisis. To its credit, the Trump administration recognizes the urgency of the challenge. But declawing China’s minerals weapon won’t be quick or easy. Beijing has no intention of letting its control wane without a fight–and is currently doubling down on its mineral dominance.

Recent U.S. trade deals–from Ukraine to Indonesia–have begun to focus on supplies of critical minerals. While that’s potentially helpful, the real solution is here at home.

America simply can’t continue to depend on overseas suppliers. It may seem shrewd to pursue high ore grades for metals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or nickel resources from Indonesia, but that does little to ease the threat of supply chain disruptions.

The U.S. has vast mineral resources. But for decades we’ve done little to tap this tremendous capacity. A new mineral policy is beginning to come into focus but we must think big and move fast.

Increased mapping of domestic resources with cutting-edge technology is an important step forward. Ongoing efforts to streamline mine permitting and address obstructive litigation delays are also necessary and encouraging.

We must also have aggressive financial support to rebalance the playing field for U.S. producers against overseas competitors. In July, the Pentagon invested $400 million for a stake in MP Materials–the operator of the largest rare-earths mine in North America–and inked a ten year offtake agreement to provide critically needed certainty for other investors. This public-private partnership should serve as the model to address countless other vulnerabilities in our mineral supply chains.

**For decades, America possessed a robust industrial base that served as a warning to adversaries. But our industrial base is no longer a deterrent. And our critical supply chains are so vulnerable, and our productive capacity so weak, that we risk conflict. There’s no time to waste in rebuilding our industrial strength from the mine up. We must do that to break Beijing’s iron grip on the world’s mineral supply chains. American lives and global security depend on it.**

# GIVEN back on AUGUST. 1st, 2025~Trump Administration Pushes Aggressive Price Support Plan to Revive U.S. Rare Earths Industry

[Trump Plans Price Supports to Revive U.S. Rare Earths Sector](https://www.cognitud.com/news/trump-administration-pushes-aggressive-price-support-plan-to-revive-us-rare-earths-industry)

In a bid to break China’s dominance over the global rare earths market, the Trump administration is preparing to expand federal price supports for U.S.-based rare earths projects, mirroring its fast-track pandemic-era strategies. According to five sources familiar with the matter, top White House officials told industry leaders at a closed-door meeting on July 24 that the administration would offer guaranteed minimum prices for rare earths, signaling a broader commitment to reshaping critical mineral supply chains.

The meeting, led by President Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro and National Security Council official David Copley, brought together executives from ten rare earths firms and representatives from major tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Corning. These companies depend heavily on rare earths to manufacture electronics, defense components, and clean energy technologies.

Navarro and Copley emphasized that a recent Pentagon-backed price floor deal with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earths producer, was not an isolated case. Instead, similar support mechanisms are in development to stabilize market conditions and attract investment in domestic mining, processing, recycling, and magnet manufacturing.

***“We’re moving in ‘Trump Time’—as fast as possible with efficiency,” Navarro told Reuters, confirming the meeting. He said the goal is to rebuild U.S. supply chains from mine to finished product and likened the urgency of the effort to Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development.***

China has maintained rare earth market dominance for over 30 years and temporarily halted exports in March amid rising trade tensions with Washington. That move, combined with growing demand for critical minerals, has heightened U.S. concern about supply chain vulnerabilities.

At the meeting, officials urged companies to tap into billions of dollars in tax incentives and subsidies available through Trump’s newly approved July 4 tax and spending bill. They also called on tech giants to support the sector through direct investment or acquisitions. Apple, which recently signed a rare earths supply deal with MP Materials, and Corning did not respond to comment requests. Microsoft declined to comment.

Attendees included startups and recyclers like Phoenix Tailings, Momentum Technologies, Vulcan Elements, REEcycle, and Cyclic Materials, all working on innovative solutions for rare earth recovery and processing. Battery recyclers Redwood Materials and Cirba Solutions, along with U.S. government-backed TechMet and magnet producer Noveon, were also present.

Some participants requested a ban on the export of products containing rare earth magnets to encourage domestic recycling. Navarro reportedly said such a move might be considered later, once the U.S. industry matures enough to withstand Chinese retaliation. “All policy options are on the table,” he told Reuters. “As President Trump loves to say, ‘Let’s see what happens.’”

# ***Follow-up meetings with the companies are expected within four to six weeks, part of an accelerated timeline to mobilize resources and build out a domestic critical minerals sector critical to national security and technological independence.

[NioCorp: The Strategic Basket = Niobium the \\""Quiet Giant!\\"", Titanium, Scandium & ScAl alloys, Dy, Tb, Nd\/Pr ](https://reddit.com/link/1nf09rq/video/s5qe88yospof1/player)

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October **could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.**

[NioCorp's Critical Minerals check all the boxes to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/n81ag9m3spof1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7cb806a46d93d89fc9abad32b62b26323b93ee)

**MHO \~** Following Monday’s Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most critical phase yet. Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays due mid-to-late October, paving the way for a resource update and a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. Titanium negotiations with three U.S. majors are advancing, Stellantis remains engaged on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD are moving forward — with first scandium metal targeted by November. Most significant: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighters, marking Elk Creek as a true defense cornerstone.

Strategically, the project now carries momentum few peers can match. Backing includes a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. On Tuesday, Mark Smith underscored how Elk Creek’s niobium could help free the U.S. from reliance on Brazil, where supply represents a “Sword of Damocles” over American industry. **Pending drill results**, NioCorp may be in a position to supply a **substantial portion — if not all — of U.S. niobium needs**, while scandium cements Elk Creek as the “Saudi Arabia” of next-gen alloys.

**Looking ahead, the RedChip presentation — now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15PM EST — is raising eyebrows. Why the delay?** In context, it suggests management wants maximum visibility to align **with key catalysts: \*\*\* DoD price-support talks mid-September??\*\*\***, drill results, or even a partnership reveal. With offtakes and defense ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine-in-the-making” — it is fast becoming the flagship U.S. critical minerals project, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp could redefine America’s resource independence.

***Seeing the ""Big-Picture"": NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers the U.S. a single-source solution for scandium, niobium, titanium, and magnet rare earths — a mineral basket that secures defense supply chains, empowers next-gen aerospace and energy systems, and positions America for true industrial independence.***

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling!.... Full Steam Ahead....](https://reddit.com/link/1nf09rq/video/z6a2ddwbspof1/player)

**IMHO/Speculation:\~ September looks like a convergence point:** Australian critical mineral firms are in D.C. Sept. 15–19 lobbying, while the Trump/Navarro commission’s promised price-support discussions might also hit mid-month??

NioCorp’s decision to delay its RedChip event until Sept. 24 strongly suggests they expect to present after news—likely DoD/industry policy signals plus their own drill results and a defense prime partnership on Sc-Al.

The timing ""might not be random.""—this is shaping up as a coordinated window of U.S. policy + industry alignment, with NioCorp right in the middle.  (Wishful thinking ...perhaps, but **NioCorp has been on ""FIRE"" SINCE AUGUST without slowing down!**

**Waiting for more material news as it becomes available with many...**

Chapter 1 Let's Divorce The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.

He said softly, ""This is for the person I owe the most--my beloved.""

From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion.

Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. ""At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is.""

The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.

She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.

""Quite a feast tonight,"" he said lightly. ""Did something happen?""

Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.

Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, ""You didn't forget, did you?""

No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?

Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. ""Forget what exactly, Evelina?""

""The sapphire earrings... you bought them, didn't you?"" Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.

""How do you know about those earrings?"" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things.

A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.

Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty--gentle features, eyes soft and expressive--but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.

Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina.

Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. ""I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely--""

Cary interjected her abruptly, ""They're for Esme.""

At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary's voice softened noticeably. ""She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.""

Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.

So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?

And what did that make her--the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?

Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt. ""Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was--the one that blinded you?""

On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.

When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.

Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.

If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.

""You know nothing about it!"" Cary retorted harshly. ""Esme wasn't to blame!""

He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. ""Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,"" he replied defensively. ""If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.""

Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. ""What... are you saying?""

It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.

How had Esme ended up with all the credit?

""Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?""

""Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice--the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,"" Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.

But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?

Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.

Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.

With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.

Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth. Quietly, bitterly, she asked, ""Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?""

Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.

Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. ""I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough.""

Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?

Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.

Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time. ""Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore.""

Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement--an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.

Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.

He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.

Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.

""If you want more..."" Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.

Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.

Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan--would she really walk away from a life of comfort?

Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, ""It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice.""

Chapter 2 The Queen Returns Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. ""Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.""

Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.

And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.

Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, ""I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong--can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?""

Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.

So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.

She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.

She had one modest request--a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they'd peacefully part ways.

Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.

""True love conquers everything,"" Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. ""I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.""

Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.

""Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property--you can't take it!""

Evelina laughed coldly. ""I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary.""

Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward. ""What's happening here?""

Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, ""Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!""

His brow creased slightly. ""Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.""

""Absolutely not,"" she replied coldly. ""Why should I?""

""You're unbelievable!"" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.

Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.

In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.

""The car is yours--I don't want it,"" Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.

Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.

She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.

As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.

Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. ""Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!""

Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. ""Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then.""

Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. ""Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real.""

Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. ""Wait, no--I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.""

""You're too late,"" Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.

Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.

Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.

""How's that for a farewell gift?"" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.

Kristina erupted into laughter. ""There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!""

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. ""Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.""

She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.

Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.

""She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her--""

""That's enough!"" Cary interrupted sharply.

Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, ""Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?""

Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, ""Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme--she'll see how much you've changed!""

""Don't talk nonsense,"" Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.

He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. ""Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?""

The Russell family, among Ireah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.

And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.

Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.

""I haven't forgotten,"" Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.

She clung affectionately to Cary's arm, adding eagerly, ""He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight, she'll become indispensable to the Russell family--and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.""

Cary gave a thoughtful nod.

Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.

""And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,"" he suggested encouragingly.

""Oh, thank you, Cary!"" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.

But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.

He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring. This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.

Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.

Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.

Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.

On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.

It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call--no doubt it concerned the divorce.

Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.

She said, ""I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege--the Sight Weaver.

Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to--""

Evelina quickly reassured her. ""Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry.""

Kristina remained cautious. ""Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again.""

""I'll be careful,"" Evelina replied firmly.

Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, ""You won't be meeting them looking like this.""

Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. ""Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.""

And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.

With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.

Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, ""Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.""

Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.

Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.

He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. ""Ms. Marsh?"" He stumbled over his words. ""You look absolutely extraordinary.""

Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.

""Is this Miss Russell herself?"" Margot hurried forward, her expression instantly switching to flattery.

Today marked Jasper's arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.

She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.

With that grace and confidence, who else could she be but a Russell?

""Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked."" Evelina's tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.

Margot's mouth dropped open. ""It's you?"" she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.

At that precise moment, another vehicle approached. Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.

Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.

Just a few days had passed--how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.

Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. ""That's your ex-wife, isn't it?"" she said softly. ""Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.""

Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap--acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.

Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. ""Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?""

Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.

She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, ""Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You're delusional!""

In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.

Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, ""Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today--this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson.""

Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, ""I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!""

Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, ""Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.""

Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. ""You wouldn't dare!""

Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. ""Esme, please protect me. We'll be family soon--you have to defend me.""

She emphasized ""family"" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.

Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. ""It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here.""

Evelina scoffed sharply, ""Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?""

Esme's expression turned rigid.

This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?

Margot quickly retorted, ""Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!"" Turning to Cary, she said, ""Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!""

With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. ""It's okay. Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners--it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her.""

Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's implication.

Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes, Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.

Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, ""If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.""

Chapter 4 Demi Takes A Stand Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, ""Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.""

Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.

""Don't you dare walk away from me!"" Cary's temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more--but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.

Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist--details he'd somehow overlooked until now.

Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.

Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.

It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.

Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.

Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. ""What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!""

Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.

Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.

Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. ""Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much.""

""Please don't worry yourself, Demi."" Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. ""The weather is getting chilly--are your joints troubling you again?""

Demi sighed deeply. ""Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.""

""You've treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,"" Evelina replied sincerely.

Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.

""That foolish grandson of mine--blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,"" Demi replied softly.

Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. ""It's alright, Demi.""

Tenderly, Demi pleaded, ""Evi, sweetheart... just once more, can you give Cary another chance--for my sake?""

""I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"" Evelina answered quietly.

She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.

Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. ""Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.""

Her eyes glistened with tears.

Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother, Elora Gibson.

Demi's temper erupted immediately.

She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.

Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.

A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques--her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.

Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.

""What was that about, Grandma?"" Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.

Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. ""How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?""

More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future.

Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride--Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.

""I've said this countless times,"" Cary responded in exasperation. ""Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?""

His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.

It had to be Evelina causing trouble again--poisoning Demi's mind.

Without restraint, he said sharply, ""Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?""

Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina's modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, ""Of course it's her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family. She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she's utterly despicable!""

Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself, Demi interrupted harshly, ""Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?""

Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, ""Demi, I didn't mean--""

Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, ""Grandma, please stop scolding Mom. Let's just face reality--you simply don't want me to leave Evelina.""

Turning deliberately, he took Esme's hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. ""But that's non-negotiable. Esme is the one I love--she is my only future.""

""Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,"" Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm. Anger visibly surged through her, shaking her frail body.

Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.

After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, ""Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I'm alive.""

Cary's eyes widened in alarm. ""Grandma, you can't mean--""

With fierce authority, Demi's frail hand slammed against her chair's armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. ""I've spoken, and my decision is final,"" she replied resolutely. ""Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.""

Chapter 5 Imposter ""Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?"" Margot immediately protested, indignation coloring her voice. ""She's nobody--just some orphan without parents--""

Margot's rant was swiftly silenced by Demi's piercing glare, causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.

Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. ""Demi, Cary is your own grandson...""

With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, ""I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let's see how deep his pockets run.""

She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary--if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she'd undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who'd stick by him through hardships.

Muscles tense, Cary's jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, ""Satisfied now?""

Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi's fierce support, she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing.

Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.

Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would've already walked away.

""Ma'am--Ma'am!""

Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room, gasping for breath. ""Mr. Russell... he's arrived!""

""Bring him in."" Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.

Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over herself. ""Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?""

With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. ""You're stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless--"" Her thoughts darkened instantly, wishing fervently Evelina wasn't present.

Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said, ""We're expecting an important guest. Shouldn't you discreetly leave through the back entrance?""

Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. ""Thanks for reminding me. Actually, Cary and I haven't officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I'm still his wife--a rightful member of this family.""

She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary's chest. ""But Miss Barton here... she's merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor.""

""How dare you!"" Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.

Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. ""Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr. Russell came specifically for Esme. She's exceptional--the only one skilled enough to restore his niece's eyesight.""

His words halted Demi's departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. ""Who did you say could cure blindness?""

""Esme,"" Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride. ""Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell--she even cured me.""

At that moment, Demi finally got it--why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.

Honestly, she wouldn't blame her one bit.

""Esme, is this true?"" Demi's tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.

Unable to meet Demi's piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.

Yet Cary, unaware, kept lauding Esme's supposed talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in, elevating her to almost mythical status.

A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. ""Seems I've arrived at the perfect moment.""

Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone's attention.

Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. ""Mr. Russell, you're finally here--we've been waiting eagerly!""

Though she'd never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.

Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.

Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous, nearly stumbled in her eagerness.

Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment, stopping purposefully in front of Esme. ""You're the renowned Sight Weaver?""

Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.

She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell's caliber--there was absolutely no room for error.

""I... I apologize,"" Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. ""My dress got stained. I need to change immediately.""

She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.

However, Evelina's composed voice stopped her cold. ""Miss Barton, surely you're not running away already? Could it be because you're pretending to be Professor Mitchell's student?""

Evelina's calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.

If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like Cary, she could have him--no one was stopping her.

Yet, shamelessly exploiting her mentor's reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.

""That's nonsense!"" Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.

Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. ""I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes.""

""Oh?"" Evelina's soft smile was deceptively gentle. ""If that's true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?""

She had personally conducted three major surgeries, alongside one subtle corrective procedure she'd never publicly mentioned.

After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied, ""Three, obviously. I performed each myself.""

""You're lying."" Demi's voice sliced sharply through the air. ""It was four.""

Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself, saying, ""R-right, four! Of course it was four.""

""Make up your mind, Esme--was it three surgeries or four?"" Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.",1,1757675163.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Dad! I watched a commercial about a video game and I want it!”, “oh? What game might that be?”, “sonic the hedgehog!”, Robert stops as he remembers about that game as he nods, “sure kido i’ll take you in like an hour or so when the game is actually out”, Alan left and hopped onto his old laptop and watched videos until he saw a website advertised, about a optical Sega Genesis as it said free on it as Alan being a kid and wanting to play sonic he immediately remembered the address of his own home and put it in as the thing asked one question… “do you want to be my FRIEND?”, Alan stared at the screen as he didn’t know what to do so he just clicked yes to not be mean as the website said predicament day at night at 1am, Alan was happy as later that day his dad would take him to a store and they would just buy sonic the hedgehog, but not the console but Alan remember the website thing as he just had to wait at night, within that night Alan walked out of his bedroom and wait at the front door for almost an hour, as he heard a knock as Alan opens the door and looks down and sees a box… as he picks it up and goes inside closing the door behind him, Alan made his way to his room and closed the door and opened the box… inside of it was a Sega Genesis but it’s colour was a different shade then the original ones his friends were talking about but he just thought he could’ve gotten lucky and gotten a newest version just for himself, Alan plugged it in and put the cartridge inside as he turns on his mini tv and sees the title screen, Alan started playing hill zone act?, Alan we’re sure he thought that it was Greenhill zone act1, then again he forgets a lot of things (mostly), Alan plays as the blue hedgehog on screen moves around with his controls until the game makes a loud sound before fading into a black screen, the words of “Do you remember me?”, two options appeared ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Alan tries to remember desperately as he couldn’t as he clicked on no, “aw… what a shame how about I jog your memory?”, the tv cracks as Alan backs away until a glove hand came out out of the TV and grabbed him by his face in a second and all Alan felt… was a sharp pain before everything went black, the next morning Robert went into his son’s room and sees his kid (Alan) dead on the floor his neck snapped a full 180, Robert quickly calls the police as the cops arrive to see a crying dad holding his kids body and a broken TV in the same room as they took the body away as they took Robert for an interrogation, “so tell me what happened yesterday or today that could’ve caused this to happen, Mr Robert”, “m-my son was alive… heathly and well, I took him to go get sonic the hedgehog yesterday but I never got the console”, the officer stops, “wait that could be a clue. There’s a console in the room where you were in sir”, the officers quickly get up and examine the console, after a long while the only trace the officers can find is a white glove that looked way too small for an adult… years have past as Robert got sonic 2 as he played it… knowing his son would have loved it as Robert turns off the console for the night and sleeps,

Meanwhile…. Alan wakes up his head hurting and neck itchy as he gets up and stands his legs wobbly as he looks around, he sees a lot of green things, water and a clear sky as it reminded him of sonic the hedgehog, as he gets up and looks down and jumps, his body was of yellow fur and he had 2 tails which he thought was pretty cool as he made his way into zone……

Act 1, 𝗔⃥𝘭̸𝗮⃥𝘯̸’⃥𝘴̸ tails, suffering

…tails(Alan) would walk into hill zone once more as Alan looks around intrigued by everything his childish mentality enjoying the bright colours as he ran though the green hill zone until he tripped and felt a sharp pain of remembrance… a few years ago he died by a hand, Alan breathes as he kept running until he stops and sees his favourite character, sonic!(it ain’t him though), Alan would walk over until he heard loud wet snaps as he stops and sees his idol eating a little flicky as the sonic turns and faces Alan as he backs away a bit scared, “don’t be afraid my dear friend I’m YOUR friend after all”, Alan stops and remembers about the website asking to be friends, “w-wait that was you who was asking to be my friend?”, “yes it was Now then.. how about we play a game of tag?, Alan perked up “tag? I LOVE TAG”, “get a head start fox”, Alan realizes he’s in a body of a fox. But it didn’t bother him as he started to run as he heard static and everything became quiet as he hears “TIMES UP”, as he runs faster Alan takes a look behind him and sees the sonic slowly catching up to him until he felt a needle stab him in the leg as he trips over crying a bit as the sonic appears right in front of him grabbing Alan’s (tails) and slowly start to pull on his lower and upper half, “A-AH S-STOP-“, Alan felt an excruciating pain after his body was split in half as everything one black once more, Alan? Wakes up feeling a bit lost as he could barely remember anything, Alan gets up And feels a sense of pain through him, he started to cry and scratch his neck feeling aburning itch until an entire hand, comes out of he’s throat and snaps his neck and wants more leaving him in darkness, “your my FRIEND now we will always play my game, every single day you wake up”, the next day Robert gets up and turns on the Sega Genesis to play sonic 2 until he stops and watches how tails is getting choked out by his own best friend sonic until the hedgehog opens his mouth as a fucking tentacle comes out and stabs the tails as he hears screams from the poor fox as it slowly decays into dust, as the screen turns black for a moment before saying, “your not meant to be here… Robert..”, and the screen switches to an anti-pirates screen, as Robert did not hesitate and immediately called the police, meanwhile tails (Alan’s soul), falls onto the floor as he feels his head hurting as he got up wondering how many times has he died? To the point he can’t even remember who he is, tails walks into scrap brain zone and walks until he felt the floor under him break and he screams feeling his body painfully and slowly withered away in a black substance, years have past as tails has dead over 8981 times his body always being regenerated back, tails always tries desperately to win a game and to escape, but he always fails anyways, he fell to the floor as the sonic grabs him by the neck and pulls his lower half “W-WAIT”, the hedgehog stops giving him a moment to speak, “y-you said w-we were f-friends, w-why are you d-doing this to m-me?”, tails asked staring into the sonic’s eyeless sockets, “it’s quite simple ‘tails’ you agreed to be my friend yet you didn’t know the consequences and that’s not my issue but yours”, and less then a moment tails neck was snapped but after his flesh was tear off,

Act 2, Dave/knuckles

in the year of 1994 sonic3&knuckles comes out as a kid named Dave would buy the game and run back home to play the game, when he got home he put in the cartridges and the title screen appeared but something was off the sonic in the title screen wasn’t moving at all. Just staring at him until the tv breaks and grabs him before snapping his head as he wakes up later in the body of knuckles as he gets up and looks around and saw tails running like hell as he jumps down and hits assailant following him it was sonic? No it couldn’t be… he looked way too different Dave (knuckles) stands his ground just to get pulled into the ground the dirt burying him as he couldn’t breathe while hearing laughter as Dave slowly loses his conscious he just hoped he wasted enough time to let tails to run away but deep down he knows that he didn’t do shit but delaying the inevitable, meanwhile tails was running faster his legs starting to hurt until he heard a car as he turns around just got get ran over by a truck as he dies for the 8903 time, as knuckles(Dave) comes back alive on angel Island as he sees a car crash into the tails as he walks away trying to remember, where is the master emerald, hidden Palace… knuckles got up and ran towards the direction as Sonic(ONE MORE GAME), watched with an amused look while chewing tails head, as he throws away the head and flys off, knuckles made his way though hidden palace, avoiding any of the traps and needles on the floor or roof as he walks towards the master emerald until he gets grabbed and slammed into the ground while ‘sonic’ was laughing while holding the master emerald and throwing it up and down like a rock, “how funny do you really think this over sized pebble can save you?”,knuckles got up and trys to punch him but ‘sonic’ caught it before ripping off his arm “how pathetic…”, he grabs knuckles with his arms coming out of the floor choking him painfully to death and ripping his flesh, “your just like Alan so much fun yet such a failure”,

Act 3, Isaiahn/Eggman but for my own sanity his called Ivo,

Isaiahn was dying as he desperately fights off the hand coming out of his TV but he fails and dies anyways, He wakes up feeling buff as hell as he looks down and saw he’s appearance, DOCTER Eggman, Ivo(Isaiahn), gets up and checks the cameras in front of him and sees tails(Alan), and knuckles(Dave) both dead as he got up and runs deeper into the base as he sees ‘sonic’ coming towards him as Ivo quickly, moved behind and runs back where he came from before jumping into the death egg robot, which ‘sonic’ didn’t waste time and started to attack thigh it didn’t taje long after a few minutes later ‘sonic’ got bored and broke the death egg robot as Ivo falls out and trys to run but he’s legs get ripped off as he falls and ‘sonic’ walks towards him as Ivo closes his eyes until metal sonic(Izumi), rushes in hitting ‘sonic’ away, “Doctor quit being a little bitch and get up”, Ivo gets up “Damn alright let’s get the the hell out of here”, both Ivo and metal sonic left as soon as they could as ‘sonic’ got up and less then a second Ivo felt his back snap as his crumples to the floor, “fuck… metal sonic get the hell out of here immediately and that’s an order and turn on self protocol”, Ivo yelled as metal flys off as he was grabbed and was ripped in half as ‘sonic’ stares at the flying away metal sonic, “you can run, fly, do whatever but in the end it will all end the same… Hahahah… HAHAHAHA… AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH”",1,1757675110.0,u_Divinehatredust,0,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

The worst part? Surprise deadlines that appeared out of nowhere, like an extra project casually announced for the following Monday.

My Google search history at that point was basically a cry for help: “how to write 10 pages overnight,” “affordable essay help ASAP,” “essay help under $20,” “cheap paper writing reddit reviews.” I wasn’t chasing perfection - I just needed a budget paper writing service that wouldn’t drain my wallet or my will to live.

That’s when I stumbled onto [WritePaperForMe](https://write-paper-for-me.online/?rt=lENmkyr4) and it instantly caught my attention because:

* 🔒 Essays written from scratch, checked and plagiarism-free - no copy-paste shortcuts.
* 🤝 Total privacy - your info and orders stay between you and the service.
* ✏️ Free revisions included, so edits don’t cost extra.
* 📞 Real people in support chat 24/7, not bots.
* ⏰ Always met my deadlines, even the short ones.
* 💸 They even offer a money-back guarantee if the work doesn’t meet expectations.

The features they highlight online? That’s exactly what I got in reality:

Ordering took just a couple of minutes: pick the paper type, set the deadline, add the topic and every detail you can think of, hit submit…and then hold your breath. I gave them two days, fully expecting to get the paper at the very last minute. Instead, my inbox pinged a whole day early.

Five pages, perfectly formatted, packed with real, verifiable sources. No filler, no weird phrasing, no “AI soup” sentences. I opened it ready to mark things up - but I didn’t change a word. It was ready to go.

Sure, essay help under $20 works best for shorter assignments, but even longer papers stay in the best cheap essay service range. And after trying other services that left me rewriting half the work, this cheap essay writing service felt like a lifesaver. Compared to most cheap paper writing reddit recommendations, it was cleaner, more reliable, and actually followed my instructions word-for-word.

For me, [WritePaperForMe](https://write-paper-for-me.online/?rt=lENmkyr4) wasn’t just a service - it was the academic version of a friend showing up with coffee when you’re drowning in deadlines.

1nf03zl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf03zl,"By jove, I think she's got it! Placecards problem solved to my satisfaction.","Thank you to everyone who responded to my plea for help. It's taken me all morning to finally figure out a solution that I'm happy with.

Despite saying this morning that I was just going to use my own handwriting, I knew I hated the idea, so I kept thinking. I contacted another local calligrapher in desperation and she quoted £100 to write my 40 names. I know she's an expert in her field but this simply isn't within my budget (especially after wasting the money on the teeny tiny stickers) so back to the drawing board I went.

I'd already used Canva to list the names and I amended the font to the same one that I've used for my other signage - this was what I was going to use for a final try at tracing. The more I looked at this document, the more I thought that this was how I wanted my cards to look. I got my acrylic tag and a white kraft label and tied them together with my ribbon. It gave a nice layered look, so I wondered if I could print the names and attach them to the kraft labels. 

Then, after yet another coffee, I casually asked my long suffering other half whether it was possible to print the names on the same parchment paper that I've used for my posters. So we tried......and it worked. 

I'm still working on the right size to cut the parchment so that it looks proportionate but you can hopefully get the idea. I also toyed with putting a gold border but I think it looks cleaner without. (The photos were taken on my phone so I took a photo of my screen which is why they look odd)

Thanks again for all your ideas and suggestions.

I guess I know what I'm doing for the rest of the afternoon 🙄

It is not already in the billions(market cap would be higher than ETH for a 1000x) and chances are it is not in the hundreds of millions for similar reasons. However, it could be in the 10s of millions and chances are it probably is.

If we are going off past 1000x's we can narrow the coin down to those with insane hardworking communities, those who are changing the game. 

We see Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and see their success was due to their community efforts and other things but we do not see the fact that they were revolutionary at the time. Following previous footsteps and not innovating is not enough. A project must follow what works and then also build upon the glory of the predecessors. 

**To me the next 1000x is not just a coin that dominates social media, but they must also dominate somewhere else, imo this is IRL.**

This is why my pick for the next 1000x is **Kendu**

**How Kendu Is Dominating Social Media**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

Yesterday Kendu won the CMC Boost Me competition and we got a shoutout to their 6 million followers on X!

**How Kendu Is Dominating IRL and Improving On Previous 1000x's Efforts**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts and is literally making unprecedented progress, these initiatives are all pushed by the average holder too. Imagine the staggering wave of initiatives that will come at the higher levels so more investment can be made. You can also join and release your own creative dreams under the Kendu umbrella and receive 24/7 engagement.

Retail and investors in general are cautious about investing due to bad actors, but IRL shows that Kendu is different. We are building something physical with real people and this is the most ultimate form of **Proof Of Humanity.**

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 4 festivals. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping

1nf039h,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nf039h/estranged_father_inlaw/,Estranged Father In-Law,"Thanks in advance for reading this long post. 

My husband’s (only child) father is a narcissist. His father played NO part/contribution during childhood (cheated on my mother-in-law). They would still see each other on occasion at big family/town events. My husband’s paternal grandmother and some aunts and cousins would stay in contact with my husband’s mother for Christmas a few times randomly during his childhood but no other contact/support. 

Typically we only interact with his paternal family maybe 1-2 x a year over the last decade if there was a big family/town event or funeral. When my husband’s maternal grandmother died, all his paternal family showed up to the funeral in support. It’s a smaller community so people all know each other, everyone shares hugs. It just seems generally accepted (or ignored) I guess that my husband’s father never contributed to my husband’s childhood.

When my husband and I met, I knew some of this history but didn’t quite ‘get it’. When we were getting married, I met his dad at a family event and encouraged my husband to invite his father and some of his father’s family to our wedding, specifically his paternal grandmother and some of his aunts I had met a couple times before. I wanted to honor all the grandmothers during the reception. My husband was agreeable, but cautioned me on some rules/boundaries like not inviting his father’s family to more intimate parts of the wedding planning, rehearsal dinner, etc. That all went well but a few years later, I’ve started to get more and more narcissistic vibes from his father that is making me question further interactions.

For example: 

One year we were invited to a picnic with some cousins. His dad was there and brought out a huge birthday cake with my husband’s name on it because my husband‘s birthday was the following weekend. I thought this was normal, until later my husband said his father was never around for birthdays. I asked my husband’s mother about this and she confirmed the same.

When my husband’s paternal grandmother was getting sick, we would occasionally visit her. Because my husband’s father lived with her, we would see him and interact, never really getting into too much conversation, but just pleasantries. This was probably more interaction than had happened ever before with my husband and his father. On one of these visits, we took her a Christmas gift, so then a few weeks later, my husband‘s father called us to meet up because his family had sent gifts since we had visited the grandmother. We agreed to meet and received the gifts in a parking lot.

On another one of the visits, my husband‘s father had asked a cousin make us breakfast while he visited with us in the kitchen. The grandmother was bedridden in another room so it felt like the visit was kind of hijacked, not focused on the grandmother.

After the grandmother died, the family home was inherited by my husband’s father. A pipe burst over the winter and we both got a random text one day stating from his father that he’s getting cousins together to help with the pipes and “you need to help me remodel this bathroom.” We decided not to reply.

A couple years later my husband‘s father text so my husband could sign something, my husband didn’t respond. And then one day he showed up to our house with the papers in hand because he had surgery the next day (we don’t know or ask what his health issues are). He wanted my husband to sign “incase something happened”. We both felt pressure because of the surgery the next day so my husband signed it; we did not get a copy. My husband said it was just standard will language. I really regret this because we want nothing to do with inheriting anything from his father.

At an aunt’s 90th birthday party, my husband‘s father asked where I work, so I shared, but didn’t say much else. I got a text message a few days later from a cousin because they had heard from my husband’s father that I could “hook them up.” I sent a text to my husband‘s father stating that Cousin contacted me and I’m sorry but I don’t have any access to corporate discounts, I’m not sure how they got that impression. And he responded. “Oh, I didn’t know.”

Side Note: I regret sharing my phone number with this side of the family; I shared phone number early on in our relationship with one of the cousins. We sometimes get added to random group texts for prayers or photos, and I had sometimes responded with emojis, but more recently we don’t respond. 

At another event, as we were leaving my husband’s father said to me “you really need to invite my family to see your house, none of them have seen your home, at least invite them over for coffee or dinner or something.” I didn’t say anything other than bye, gotta go, and continued to walk out. He said this to me only as my husband was busy saying bye to others.

My husband had been getting texts around Christmas 2024: “I have something for you guys we should get together.” We didn’t reply. And then over a few months the texts turned into “I really need to see you guys.” And phone calls trying to meet up. So we met up at a parking lot this past July. I baked a banana bread to give him. His first words to me specifically and sternly were “it’s been 11 months”. I just said “oh yeah that must have been so-and-so’s funeral.” He had Christmas gifts for us and it was two filled children’s Christmas stockings (we don’t have kids). We were confused if these were even intended for us but we didn’t say anything. He also had a box of other stockings and he said to my husband “please take these to your cousins kids on your mom’s side”. My husband and I looked at each other very confused, so I stepped in and said “well we don’t see them very often, it wouldn’t make sense for us to take them.” At the end of the conversation, he mentioned that he was talking to his doctor again about surgery (in another state). We both just wished him well, didn’t ask any questions. He then showed me a picture on his phone of one of his nieces and said “they came out to visit me when I had my last surgery.” I didn’t know what to say. We just quickly finished exchanging the two stockings and bread and said thanks and bye. 

At some point it’s going to get into a difficult situation with his father’s health issues where we will have to make decisions on what our obligations are to his father and what his family thinks our obligations are to his father. It’s weird for me because if/when my parents were ever to have health issues, that would be my highest priority and obligation, but for my husband’s father I don’t feel like we should have that obligation. 

My husband and I are always open with each other about these narcissistic interactions and agree to not reply if possible, not ask/inquire further about comments, and keep things quick and topical for any interactions. We are lucky that we live a little bit farther away than most of this small town family and we travel once a month for work so we just keep to ourselves usually.

In Summary:
For good reason, my husband was estranged from his father. Early in our relationship I opened the door too far with interactions with my husband’s father. I now see his father is a narcissist and is leveraging me to have a connection to his son which feels gross in a way. Something just feels off and I don’t know how to proceed, any advice is appreciated.

In this calm, memories come easy: the days when it was just my boyfriend and me, now ex. Two hopeful people steering each other through our hopes and big plans in the future. We cheered each other on, picked one another up, mapped out futures like constellations. For a while it felt like forever. Not all love stories have happy endings, right? Some just end. And sometimes, one is left alone.

Months have passed since we broke up. I won’t pretend otherwise — it was my fault, and I carry that. Still, there are nights I want to press rewind and undo the thing that unstitched us. Quiet evenings don’t bring comfort for me; they sharpen the absence. There’s nobody now to trade small victories with, to narrate the ridiculous parts of my day, to say “you did good” when I need it most.

I take another slow drag, feel the smoke on my chest, and let Adele fill the room. Maybe tonight I’ll let the music carry me to sleep, and tomorrow I’ll wake and do the small, stubborn work of living again. For now, this is enough — this cup, this cigarette, these memories like soft bruises.

1nf018g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYHome/comments/1nf018g/diy_improvements_to_sectional_sofa/,DIY improvements to sectional sofa - slipcover/cushion advice?,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice and inspiration on some cheapish DIY ways to improve/upcycle a very basic, uncomfortable sectional my partner and I don't currently have the funds to replace. It's a two-piece L-shaped grey sectional, both parts of which fold out into a bed (so like a single from the short-L and a double from the long-L). [It looks very similar to this one but without armrests and with ugly metal legs.](https://assets.wfcdn.com/im/95777063/resize-h1200-w1200%5Ecompr-r85/1900/190096616/Aitan+Corner+Sofa+Bed.jpg).

COMFORT
As I discovered when screwing some planks into the bottom a while ago to stop sagging, the sofa has no proper filling - just a thin layer of foam over a metal frame which I can feel when I sit down.
It also has no armrests or separate cushions. One side is against a wall which we end up using as a makeshift armrest so I'm thinking of leaning into this (heh) and creating a DIY upholstered armrest - [basically the same principle as this](https://coorierenovations.com/2022/05/24/diy-full-wall-upholstered-headboard/) - on that side to make it more comfortable. It could even incorporate a very narrow profile shelf to become like a mini coffee table and storage solution!

CARE
The sofa has no removable covers or cushions so it can only be spot-cleaned, which is a major pain. We brush and vacuum regularly and spot-clean spills etc with upholstery cleaner but it never feels truly clean. 

STYLE
We don't like the sterile grey colour or the legs. [I've crocheted a throw which helps a bit](https://images4-a-cdn.ravelrycache.com/uploads/aithytilly/1065378085/PXL_20250502_090737532_medium2.jpg), but I'm looking for a bigger change! Next on the list is definitely cushions - I've almost finished one cushion cover made from granny squares matching the throw :) want to make some more fun funky ones, definitely including a few novelty cushions [like these](https://www.pinterest.com/i/7HBubCisK/), [these](https://www.pinterest.com/i/1vShmdMJn/), or [these](https://www.pinterest.com/i/5MTa0wMzW/).

I have two intervention options in mind:

**Option 1: add padding and make a removable, washable slipcover.**

The padding could be a topper (made from an old duvet we have?) and/or I'll buy upholstery foam and slide it inside the sofa where there's already a thin layer, just to bolster it a bit.

The slipcover should definitely be sewn rather than crocheted for durability, comfort (the itchy wool is lovely for a cozy winter cuddle but not so much to sit on in summer) and ease of laundering. I also might incorporate a bit of a skirt at the bottom to cover the legs.

What would be the best approach for a slipcover on a sectional like this? One large piece for the whole L-shape or two separate covers for each section? One large cover would prevent the two pieces from slipping apart, but it seems more complex to get right and would be harder to wash/dry particularly in heavy upholstery fabric. 

**Option 2: purchase some really thick upholstery foam and make seating cushions with removable, washable covers.** The back would still be visible but I can make a matching cover just for this.

In terms of fabric for both options, I actually have quite a lot of upholstery fabric but not enough to make one whole matching cover. I could patchwork it but our living room is already pretty eclectic and busy, and as I say I want to make lots of fun cushions and love a ""layered"" sofa, so I think the cover itself should be a plain solid colour - I just don't like that grey specifically. So we'll need to buy the fabric most likely which is kind of fun as it means we have total freedom of colour and texture etc!

I've sewn for years but only pretty casually so I'm hoping for some advice and inspiration which is weirdly hard to find online. Any links to tutorials, sewing patterns, or just general advice on this kind of DIY project would be amazing, as would visual inspiration even of commercially made covers or sofas which could give me some direction on how to approach aesthetics and construction.

Tonight, Metro Manila feels gentle — a rare kind of hush. I’m at my window with a warm cup of coffee and a cigarette between my fingers, watching the night take its slow breath. 

In this calm, memories come easy: the days when it was just my boyfriend and me, now ex. Two hopeful people steering each other through our hopes and big plans in the future. We cheered each other on, picked one another up, mapped out futures like constellations. For a while it felt like forever. Not all love stories have happy endings, right? Some just end. And sometimes, one is left alone.

Months have passed since we broke up. I won’t pretend otherwise — it was my fault, and I carry that. Still, there are nights I want to press rewind and undo the thing that unstitched us. Quiet evenings don’t bring comfort for me; they sharpen the absence. There’s nobody now to trade small victories with, to narrate the ridiculous parts of my day, to say “you did good” when I need it most.

I take another slow drag, feel the smoke on my chest, and let Adele fill the room. Maybe tonight I’ll let the music carry me to sleep, and tomorrow I’ll wake and do the small, stubborn work of living again. For now, this is enough — this cup, this cigarette, these memories like soft bruises.

As Daisy cleaned her eyes of the debris, she spotted the flurry of plasma bolts heading towards her. Hastily, she blocked the barrage with her shield as it was inches away, but the shockwaves still knocked her off Flaremane. A group of Nemesis ships flew after her and prepared their guns to land the killing blow. But as they descended upon the falling Daisy, Lucas shot at them. The Nemesis quickly broke off from their attack, trying to evade the bombardment, but Lucas, skillfully flying, destroyed them all before they could.

As Flaremane recovered Daisy, Lucas shot her a big thumbs up from his cockpit.”You okay, Damara?”

“Thanks to you, my friend.”

\*\*\*

The war room at the United Planets base was overflowing with anxiety. The personnel monitored the battle closely as the casualties increased. The United Planets' ships had a transmitter that told their location on the chaotic battlefield. Carter and the others looked intensely at the giant holophone panel displaying the numbers. As they decreased faster and faster, he knew another pilot was slain, shot out of the sky. And as a loud alarm rang, he couldn’t help but draw his sword, instinctively ready to defend his remaining soldiers.

”What the hell does that sound mean?”

“General Carter, it means we’re dead. Darkhold is about to reach full power,” Eugene said.

*“No,”* Carter said, filling with dread.

Carter turned his gaze to the holophone panel, and the image made his face pale white. Darkhold began to emit dazzling purple light that bathed the battlefield for miles. Its guns launched a titanic salvo of plasma in the blink of an eye. The assault was not only immensely devastating but also precise. Hitting the United Planets with near-perfect accuracy as the Nemesis retreated. The energy attack covered the sky from left to right, decimating the United Planets except for one pocket of ships. Using all her strength, Daisy protected her comrades from the assault with her giant shield, fighting against the herculean strength of the shock waves.

Damara, if you can hear me. We're going into full retreat from the planet.”

“But General Carter, they could still shoot us. The fortress’s range is the entire sector.” 

“We still have to try. If we stay here, we’re dead. There’s no choice but to cut our losses and save as many civilians as possible,"" Carter said.

""Sir, yes, sir.” Daisy swallowed. “I'll cover your exit while you start evacuating. They'll want me dead above everyone else.""

\*\*\*

The remaining United Planets ships went into full retreat. Daisy hung behind to cover their rear from the assault, blocking the plasma. But as they flew, Lucas spotted something invaluable with his eagle eyes, honed from years of aerial combat. Through the seemingly impenetrable wall of light, he deciphered an attack pattern. From that came a narrow path to assault the mighty fortress. 

A grim decision quickly plagued his mind. Would he dare fly to it by himself? He was his mother’s world. Something terrible would surely befall her if he perished. And Lucas couldn’t ask his fellow soldiers to go back. The path was too narrow and treacherous. Carter would never allow it. However, retaking the planet would be a near-impossible task if they retreated now. 

So his choice was clear.

""Mother, Sarah, Daisy, I'm so sorry,"" Lucas said.

Swiftly, Lucas broke away from the other ships, diving into the bombardment.

*""Pilot, why are you heading toward the fortress? I ordered a full retreat,""* Carter said over the communicator.

""General Carter, I spotted a weakness in their attack pattern. We can't lose this part of space. I know I can do this.""

""All you'll do is end up dead. Turn around now, and that's a direct order. Fortis, do h—""

Lucas turned off his communications and focused on the task at hand. With his skillful flying, Lucas narrowly dodged several shots, making it into the slender path. As the shots were fired, certain death surrounded him at every corner, but he continued towards the fortress, undeterred. 

As he made it through the barrage, he flew through the fortress, shooting everything in sight. Quickly, cyber troopers and ships gave chase, trying to shoot him dead. But as Lucas attempted to evade, he spotted a structure surging with incredible power. He hastily realized the structure must have been one of its power conduits, flying toward it at top speed. Lucas unleashed a salvo at it, starting a massive explosion. However, he jetted from the fortress using his ship’s turbo boosters, narrowly escaping the monstrous blaze.

The explosion sent shockwaves for miles away from the fortress. And quickly, its systems lost power, going dark. Cymbeline released a scream rivaling the ferocity of Morana’s roars as the plasma fire subsided. Still, as he saw Lucas's ship, he typed away on a holographic control panel. Summoning a giant targeting system, immediately locked onto Lucas.

*""Blacken and burn,""* Cymbeline shouted.

Three circles of increasing size appeared before Cymbeline. He shot a jet of fire from the palm of his hand into them. The targeting system guided it right toward Lucas. And before he could dodge, it hit him, blowing up his jets. The explosion knocked him unconscious, and he fell helplessly through the air. However, as Daisy saw the attack, she rushed towards her friend's aid.

Morana spotted Daisy in the air, and she immediately sprouted her wings to give chase. But Cymbeline grabbed her leg, pulling her back down.

”Morana, please stay here. You’ll be a hindrance if you go after Damara.”

Morana swiftly grabbed Cymbeline by the neck, crushing his windpipe. ""What did you say to me?”

“C-calm down. I have a plan, and I don't want you hurt. ”Cymbeline pointed towards Daisy. 

As Morana looked at her, she released Cymbeline, seeing a group of cyber troopers attacking her. Daisy sped through the air, dodging their shots, trying to get to Lucas before he crashed. Quickly, Daisy reached Lucas and ripped open his cockpit. But as she attempted to get him out, one of the troopers shot her hand. As Daisy reeled in pain, she tossed her shield at the enemies, but they avoided her attack and continued their barrage. 

Daisy prepared to attack again, but she stopped as she saw a giant tree in the path of the falling ship. She had to grab Lucas before it was too late. Still, the enemies bombarded her more, keeping her from reaching out her hand to him. However, she soon took the risk, focusing on attack and flying away from Lucas, tossing her shield at them.

Lucas fell further away, but the moment the enemy took to evade, Daisy pulled on Flaremane's reins, summoning the stallion's speed to catch up. The collision neared, but Daisy ripped Lucas out of the ship. And she flew away with Lucas as the ship collided with the tree, exploding in a brilliant inferno. The troopers continued their attack as Flaremane carried the two to safety. 

""Your plan failed.” Morana pointed to her angry face. “Note the lack of surprise.""

""I—""

""I'm in charge now. I now know why the emperor wanted me to come. He knew you would make a mess of things, and someone would have to clean it up,"" Morana interrupted. 

Cymbeline looked at Morana condescending and intense flames incarnated around his body.

""No, I am the commanding officer of this mission. I alone will set fire to our enemies.” Cymbeline shoved Morana, forcing her onto a wall. *“You will do what I say to aid that cause, but until then, remain silent.""*

Morana looked deeply at Cymbeline. Never before had he or anyone other than Mavor stood their ground against her. With his devotion to the cause on display, something started within Morana. She gripped her chest as her icy heart pounded harder and harder like a chorus of drums, and her cheeks blushed red.

""O-okay, you're in charge.” Morana walked forward, pressing her breasts against Cymbeline. “Give the word, and I'll do anything.""

""Good. Now, we have to push on with the invasion.""

Morana kissed Cymbeline on the cheek. ""Yes, sir, please keep the orders coming.""

\*\*\*

Daisy and the others returned to their crumbling base. Hastily, she dismounted from Flaremane and carried Lucas to some doctors, treating the injured. 

“Will he be okay?”

“We won’t know until we run some tests,” The doctor said.

As she saw the Generals, she dashed over to them. ""Sirs, what's the plan now? Lucas bought us some time, but we need another attack.""

""Isn't it obvious? We should call reinforcements to attack the enemy while they're down.” Carter exhaled heavily. “I only hope they can get here in time.""

""I'm not even sure that's the right choice,” Favian said.

“What are you talking about, Hydromos?”

“Without the guardian barrier, calling in reinforcements means pulling them away from vital sectors. And now, the enemy's retreat from earlier stinks of a trap.""

The ground shook like an earthquake. In a heartbeat, Daisy prepared for another battle, tightening her grip on her shield. But she turned pale white as she saw the source was a massive explosion from Palus urbs. Hastily, she shot her look toward the generals.

Favian gave her a nod. ""Tend to the civilians, Damara. We'll be here when you return.""

""Thank you.""

Swiftly, Daisy hurried to Flaremane and flew off like the wind. As she went to the city, she pierced through a thick layer of the blackest baneful-smelling smoke, emitting from the burning settlement. She quickly arrived over the sky at Palus Urbs to look at its disastrous state. The fire covered the great metropolis as tall buildings lay in pieces, and screams of pain filled the air. Still, she hastily landed to aid the decimated city.

As she dismounted from Flaremane, she stared up close at the devastation from the Nemesis attack. Numerous dead bodies littered the ground. And amongst the ruin, a little aquis boy cried a river as he stood solitary in a sea of death. With her superhuman speed, Daisy dashed to the boy. She consoled him with a hug. And he slowly stopped crying.

*“Please, forgive me*,*”* Daisy said sorrowfully.

As Daisy and Carter saw Clive’s ship meet a fiery crash, Daisy pulled on Flaremane’s reins, guiding him to the vessel.

*""We have to help them,""* Daisy shouted.

*""Delay that,""* Favian said over the communicator.

Daisy stopped Flaremane as she heard Favian.

""General Favian—""

""Damara, this is our last chance. If we don't destroy those generators now, that's it. This whole part of space falls to the enemy."" Favian interrupted.

“But Clive’s team was supposed to attack the third generator.”

“We’ll figure it out later. But now we must hit the other two before it’s too late.”

Daisy looked at the fiery wreckage of the ship with teary eyes. She turned her gaze to Carter, awaiting his response. And he gave it to her with a slow, reluctant nod. 

Daisy sluggishly turned away from aiding her comrades.

""S-sir, yes, sir. We'll destroy our generator quickly and then cover Yara and Lieutenant Rogers.""

\*\*\*

Clive punched open the fiery ship from within at the crash site. As the hull burst, it revealed him with the others barely alive, dragging out as many of their injured comrades as they could. The United Planets soldiers went through the immense heat and the black smoke that attacked their lungs and dashed away from the ship. Clive carried thirty people on his back, Ros had ten, and Yara had five, as the other soldiers followed them to safety.

""I hope we still have some working comms. They need to know we're still alive,"" Clive said.

""Don't bother. Even if we died, it wouldn't affect General Favian. No matter what, Mission first,"" Yara said.

""Wow, this guy sounds like a jerk.""

Yara growled like a feral beast. ""You know, Rogers, I don't think I like you.""

""Well, now the feeling is mutual.""

""Both of you, stop it.” Ros pushed the lieutenants apart from one another. “We're in enemy territory and running low on time.""

A plasma bolt flew at Ros. But as it was about to hit her head, Clive pushed her out of the way. The team quickly spotted the source of the attack. A detachment of Nemesis soldiers was fast approaching. And behind their enemies stood the power generator.

""No matter what, we need to get into that building,"" Yara said.

""Ros, are you okay with this?” Clive put a hand on her shoulder. “I mean, these guys are your people.""

""Of course not, Clive. But it's like what Damara said. We're here to fight for the dream.""

""Alright. Then let you and me put them down quickly and painlessly.""

With a nod from Ros, she and Clive drew their weapons. Alongside her bo-staff, Clive's large mace was ready for battle. With them, the remaining United Planets soldiers prepared to meet their opponents. However, as the two were about to lead the charge, Yara stopped them with a hand to their faces.

""Everybody hold it. I get the first choice of the enemy. It's been too long since I had a good fight.""

In the blink of an eye, Yara closed the distance of several meters between her and the Nemesis. She tore into the enemy with beastly strength and speed, nearly becoming a black-and-white blur. Unleashing a flurry of blows on them, punching, slashing with her claws, and kicking, constantly changing direction faster than they could defend. 

Her comrades watched her battle, unable to turn away from the animalistic savagery and beauty of her combat style. But they soon regained their senses and hurried to join her. Clive and Ros led the charge as they cut through the Nemesis army. The two bashed one enemy after the next as they made their way to the building. Battling with such skill and harmony of movement, it was as if they had been training together for years.

""Wow,"" Ros said.

""Thanks, I—""

Ros threw her bo staff at a Nemesis soldier, sneaking behind Clive. As it stabbed him in the shoulder, Clive looked at her with a smile. But in return, she blushed red.

Together, Clive, Ros, and Yara led the United Planets soldiers, subduing the remaining enemies outside. They smashed into the building, knocking down the doors, meeting more opponents fiercely guarding the generator. Still, Yara rushed into the fray with her claws out. She slashed at the enemy left and right, more beast than a person in the heat of battle. The lieutenant mowed down a dozen enemies in a minute, inching closer to the generator. Suddenly, one of the enemies shot Yara in the shoulder, knocking her unconscious. But before they could finish her, Clive and Ros came over with dire speed. Clive punched out a Nemesis, training his gun on Yara. However, exhaustion and the enemy's superior numbers began to take their toll. 

The Nemesis beat them mercilessly until they were bloody and bruised on the floor. Still, with the last of his strength, Clive resolved to one final action.*""Choke on this.""* He jumped to his feet and tossed his mace at the power generator. And as it flew across the room, it smashed into it, causing a massive explosion. 

Minutes later, Clive limped out of the building, carrying an unconscious Ros and Yara along with his other injured comrades on his back.

""One down,"" Clive said, coughing blood.

\*\*\*

Favian's ship landed near the second power generator. The Nemesis prepared to repel their enemies, forming a blockade around the building. The United Planets soldiers quickly exited the vessel for battle. And Sarah grew to a giant size to meet the challenge. However, as they were about to charge, Favian stopped them.

""Save your strength,"" Favian said.

He quickly marched to the vanguard, standing between his forces and the enemy, unfazed by their threat. The Nemesis prepared to fire on Favian, but still, he stood unfazed. As the ground started to shake, everyone learned the cause of his confidence. Summoned by Favian, a massive deluge drawn from the fortress’s water supply raced to them, quickly capturing the Nemesis in a colossal water bubble.

Sarah’s eyes widened, seeing Favian’s power. ""Oh, my gods.""

""I’ll make this quick and painless,"" Favian swiped his trident across the air.

The Nemesis struggled as they tried to escape. But Favian held them in place as water filled their lungs. Swiftly, the enemies stopped moving, and Favian burst his bubble, dropping them to the ground dead.

""Half of you form a defensive perimeter while the rest of us go inside.""

""Sir, yes, sir."" The soldiers said in unison.

Hastily, the United Planets soldiers smashed into the building. The soldiers quickly shot at the Nemesis, and Sarah brought the fight to a swift end with one giant stomp on their skulls.

""Good work, Fortitudo,"" Favian said.

""Thanks, sir. Now, let's finish this quickly. There's someone with the med unit I want to get back to.""

Favian hurried over to the power generator. As he moved towards it, he stopped as the sounds of a massacre came from outside. The echoes of terrified screams and plasma fire traveled across the room, hitting their ears like glass shards. But swiftly, everything became as quiet as a grave, with his and Sarah's faces losing color from the deathly silence. In a flash of light, Cybertroopers burst into the room. They shot down their enemies twice as fast as the United Planets, littering the floor with their bodies.

*""Not again,""* Sarah and Favian shouted in unison.

Favian tried to dash to the power generator, but one of the troopers shot him twice in the back. He dropped to the ground, coughing blood, but he struggled back to his feet. And with all his remaining strength, he staggered to his target. The troopers prepared to finish him, but Sarah intervened. She grabbed them all in her giant hands, restraining them to the floor. Still, as before, they released an immense energy field, trying to shock her away. However, even as her flesh burned and pain raced through her body, her grip was undeterred. Set like a boulder in her mind, she refused to relive what happened to Everton.

*""Not again,""* Sarah screamed.

Favian staggered closer and closer to the generator, coughing up more blood. His vision became hazier with every step, but he soldiered forward. Until he reached his target, and with one mighty stab of his trident, it exploded. 

The building collapsed in a fiery explosion. But Sarah swiftly erupted out of the rubble with Favian and several of her surviving comrades in her giant hands. However, as her vision blurred and she fought to maintain consciousness, a realization came. She knew she was no longer fit for duty.

""It's all on you now, Damara.""

\*\*\*

At the center of the fortress, Daisy flew through the air, trying to reach the final power generator. But a deadly opposition was in hot pursuit. Squadron after squadron of enemies covered the air in devotion to murdering Daisy.

Through the air, her pursuers relentlessly bombarded her and Carter. As a storm of plasma bolts rained on them, Flaremane doubled his speed to evade the attack and reach their final destination: a colossal tower. But as the assault magnified, Carter drew his sword to clear a path.*""Take this.""* And an energy slash flew from his blade as he swung it through the air. It cleaved through the enemies, alleviating their assault enough for Flaremane to make one final push to the tower.

With the path clear, Daisy’s vision was glued onto the tower even as the remaining enemies continued shooting. However, inching closer to her destination, she witnessed Cymbeline on top of it. And faster than she could defend, he shot a colossal fireball at them.

*""No,""* Daisy said, horrified.

As the attack neared them, Carter spotted a window on the tower, making a grim choice.""I'm sorry, red."" He quickly picked up Daisy, tossing her at the window. She cut through the air with remarkable speed, crashing through the window into the tower. She evaded the shot as it hit Flaremane's wings, sending him and Carter crashing to the ground.

*""C-Carter, Flaremane,""* Daisy shouted.

Daisy looked at their crash site, tears escaping her eyes, but she remembered Favian's words, forcing herself to continue the mission, running down the corridor.

\*\*\*

On the ground, Carter slowly regained consciousness in a pile of rubble. He sluggishly rose from it to be met with plasma fire from the enemy infantry. But as Carter dodged the attack, the general spotted Flaremane pinned under a pile of rubble as the shots flew by him, running to the stallion's aid. Carter hurried to Flaremane through the hail of plasma bolts. And as he freed him, he made the horse look him in the eye with a glare.

""Okay, horse, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But for Daisy’s sake, we need to work together.""

Flaremane returned Carter's glare, but as the gears of his mind turned, he remembered Daisy's smiling face. With it, he gave Carter a nod. And the stallion swiftly invited Carter onto his back to fly. Carter accepted his invitation, but as he climbed on, Nemesis infantry neared. Still, as they prepared to shoot them, Carter swung his sword, blowing them away with an energy slash. And the two hastily flew through the storm of plasma bolts above from aerial troops.

""Faster, horse, faster.""

Flaremane heeded Carter's command, summoning his speed. But as they neared the tower, the enemies swarmed them from all angles, blocking them. However, flaremane spotted another window, and a solution appeared in his mind with a smug smile. 

Carter saw Flaremane’s smile. ""Horse, what are you about to do?”

Flaremane gave Carter an answer. He flung him off his back to the window, smashing Carter into the tower. And alone, he kept the Nemesis busy as he covered himself in fire. Carter got to his feet and saw him grabbing the aerial troops’ attention, blasting fire in every direction.

1nezvbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bevelhealth/comments/1nezvbo/feature_request_dosagebased_supplement_caffeine/,Feature Request: Dosage-based supplement & caffeine tracking in Bevel,"I really enjoy using Bevel overall(I also have Gamin and Athlytics) — especially how it lets you log different things like supplements or activities in the journal and then see their effect on recovery and sleep. It already provides valuable insights into how daily habits connect to performance.

But here’s what feels missing: **dose-dependent effects.**

* With caffeine, there’s a huge difference between having one Americano (\~75 mg) and drinking ten of them. Most of us aren’t trying to quit coffee cold turkey — we just want to see how *different amounts* impact our recovery, sleep, and training.
* For magnesium, the effect on sleep is also highly dose-dependent. Logging “magnesium” at 50 mg vs 800 mg shouldn’t be treated the same, since the physiological impact is very different.
* This can be applied to different supplements, not only caffeine or magnesium(these are just important for me right now)

Other apps like **Athlytics** already allow specifying timing and intensity of caffeine intake (e.g., “little,” “moderate,” “a lot”). This makes it easier to correlate habits with outcomes.

It would be a *huge win* if Bevel could:

1. Show the impact of different caffeine dosages and timing on recovery and sleep.
2. Extend this logic to supplements (e.g., creatine, magnesium) so analytics are based on dosage, not just “taken vs not taken.”

This would make the journaling insights much more actionable and realistic.

Are there any plans to implement something like this? At least starting with caffeine would already be a game-changer.

1nezsvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnitalian/comments/1nezsvi/5_iptv_providers_i_tried_in_2025_my_honest/,5 IPTV Providers I Tried in 2025: My Honest Ranking After Too Much Coffee.,"If you’ve ever gone down the rabbit hole comparing [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/) at 1am (with a giant coffee mug in hand), you’ll know just how overwhelming it is—especially if you want solid US, UK, CA, and FR channels. I decided to test five different services this spring. Here’s my honest, slightly sleep-deprived take on what actually worked for me (and what didn’t) for my [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/) adventure.

* * *

### 1\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (discounts available for longer plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (heavy on US and UK sports, good CA and FR selection)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even during big US sports nights—almost no buffering)
    
*   **My notes:** I came across XXIPTV in a Canadian **iptv reseller** forum. The US and UK channel lineup is stacked, and it handled everything from Premier League football to late-night US talk shows without a glitch. French and Canadian content is solid, too, though if you’re looking for ultra-niche FR channels, you might want a backup. Their trial was quick and didn’t ask for payment up front, which was a win.
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Top_Rated_Streaming/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (multi-month options bring the cost down)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (broad range: US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable—minor buffering during French movie nights)
    
*   **My notes:** A friend in the UK tipped me off to IPTVMEZZY. Setup was easy, and the UK and French content was better than I expected. I found some quirky Canadian news channels I didn’t know existed. It had a couple of hiccups during big live events, but otherwise, it was steady and reliable.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Streaming_SUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially good for UK and FR, decent US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (generally smooth, but live UK sports sometimes need a refresh)
    
*   **My notes:** Aurorastreaming turned out to be an unexpected favorite for French and British content. Their VOD library is surprisingly deep, especially for classic UK TV. I did run into a bit of lag during a UK rugby match, but their support was fast and polite. Great for anyone who flips between languages like I do.
    

* * *

### 4\. [WaveConnect IPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 26,000+ live, 79,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, lighter on FR specialty channels)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (steady for everyday viewing; sports can buffer at peak times)
    
*   **My notes:** WaveConnect IPTV is the “you get what you pay for” pick—not bad at all for the price. I mostly used it for US news and some UK drama. The French lineup is pretty basic, but it’s fine if you just want the main networks. Their **iptv subscription 2025** signup was a breeze.
    

* * *

### 5\. StarStream Live

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 52,000+ VOD (US/UK core, a handful of CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening hours sometimes bring buffering, especially on UK/US sports)
    
*   **My notes:** StarStream Live is the “background TV” option. The essentials are there—news, sitcoms, a few sports—but it’s not for serious binge-watchers. Their **iptv reseller** info is up front if you’re thinking about starting your own thing, but I used it as a backup for casual viewing.

Some Things I Learned About IPTV in 2025
----------------------------------------

*   **Always try the** [**best iptv trial**](https://xxiptv.top/) first—each provider feels a little different on your own device and connection.
    
*   Don’t get dazzled by giant channel numbers. Focus on the stuff you’ll actually watch (for me: UK panel shows, Canadian news, and the odd French thriller).
    
*   Even the [**top rated iptv**](http://aurorastreaming.online/) services have the odd off night, especially during major live events.
    
*   If you’re tempted to become an **iptv reseller**, prepare to play tech support for every friend and relative you know.
    
*   Finally: use a VPN. It just makes everything simpler and safer.",0,1757673699.0,learnitalian,0,0.25,False

**Background:**  
I’m a researcher and will defend my PhD in about 3 weeks. Over the past years I struggled with productivity and concentration after a difficult period in my professional life. Things have been stable for the last 1.5 years, and after reading *Atomic Habits* I decided to deliberately work on my routines and focus.

**What I’ve done so far:**

* \~4 weeks ago, I started changing my daily structure.
* **Week 1:** Only focused on morning and evening routines.
* **Week 2:** Added a dedicated AM routine (when working from home) and started using Pomodoro. At first, I aimed for just *one* 25-minute block of full focus (even though I usually managed two).
* **Week 3:** Increased to 4 Pomodoros, with 2 as my fallback.
* **Now:** I can do 6 Pomodoros (4 is my fallback).

**My problem:**  
I’m completely exhausted. Around 11am my brain just shuts down — I feel empty and can only handle the lightest tasks while constantly seeking distractions. It feels like I’ve compressed my energy into the Pomodoro blocks rather than actually increasing my productive time.

**My question:**  
Is this just an adjustment phase where my brain is getting used to the new structure, or should I rethink my approach? My goal isn’t only efficiency, but also to increase actual *output*.

**Current daily routine:**

* **Morning:** Coffee → 15min Japanese study → make bed & nightstand → clear workspace (if needed) → plan workday → bathroom (teeth, wash face) to mark transition into “work mode.”
* **Workday:**
   * 4 × 25/5 Pomodoros → 30–60min break (10–15min fitness, cold shower, planning, emails)
   * Planned: 4 more Pomodoros, but I usually crash after 2.
* **Evening:** Declutter apartment → clean kitchen/living room → short meditation → journaling → sleep.

While the technical content and networking could have been valuable, the logistics are a total disaster. Here’s what’s going on:

Food and Refreshments

1. The meals are extremely limited with very few choices. It feels like cost-cutting on participant meals.

2. Only one viand served at lunch because the buffet is not enough to cater everyone, no snacks or refreshments during breaks despite long sessions.

3. Food stations are assigned far from the tables, forcing people to cross the hall and causing congestion.

4. Only one coffee station for a venue of this size, which means long lines and missed breaks.

Venue and Program Management

5. Insufficient projectors and screens, so people at the back can’t see the presentations clearly.

6. No instructions on what to do during parallel sessions. The sound from the main hall overlaps with the ongoing sessions. After the sessions, there’s no guidance either, so attendees are just left confused.

7. No ushers to guide participants and no officers at the registration desk to handle questions.

Official Receipt (OR)

8. Long queues for the OR even though participant details were pre-collected.

9. ORs are still unavailable, third-party contractors can’t answer basic questions, and no one can assure us when we’ll get them.

We paid to be here. This level of disorganization and poor service is unacceptable for a national convention. People deserve accountability and a serious explanation from PIChE Davao.

This is seriously concerning. It feels like we are robbed by the organizers. Such a waste of time. 0/10 stars.",3,1757673567.0,GigilAko,0,0.8,False

I took BC aspirin (cherry flavored powder) about 3 hrs ago. Since then, I put a load of laundry in the washer, emptied my sink and loaded the dishwasher, ordered and ate food. Just know that I could not get to that particular load of whites and the dishes for a reallllly long time. 

I am prescribed dex and they do not help with task initiation at all. What's shocking me the most is that I didn't even have to think, obsess, and plan those tasks. I was on the couch when I spotted a white blanket and thought ""I want to wash that."" So I got yp, went to the bedroom, gathered the whites that had been sitting in a pile for too long and started a load. I then found myself in the kitchen where I saw the sink and thought ""I should do the dishes"" and... I just started moving the boxes blocking the dishwasher, then moved the dishes into it, located the pods and started the wash. 

It can't be placebo, can it? I had zero expectations. Heck I expect my prescriptions to work and they barely do. 
BC contains aspirin and caffeine. I drink coffee every day including this morning ( about 5hrs prior) so it can't just be the caffeine. So please what on earth is happening?! If it's just coincidence... it's a heck of a coincidence.

1nezosw,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvisibleMotives/comments/1nezosw/the_intricate_dance_of_giftgiving_expectations/,The Intricate Dance of Gift-Giving Expectations,"So, I was thinking recently about this whole unspoken rulebook that seems to exist aroound gift-giving, especially within families. Every birthday or holiday, it feels like there's this werid pressure to analyze what each gift says about our relationships. It's like, why does the cost or thought behind a gift carry so much weight? 

Last Chrismtas, I gave my cousin a handmade scarf and in return, she gited me this really fancy, pretty expensive skincare set. It got me wondering if the gfits we give somehow reflect our subconscious attempts to balacne prceived values between us. Like, maybe she was trying to say something about maintaining status or showing gratitude—or maybe it's just aboout trying to replicate that feeling you get when giving or reeceiving something 'just rifht.' 

Or maybe I'm reading way too much into it! But I can't help but feel that there's this invisible scorecard, where we're scoring points or something based on how our gifts stack up against each other's expectations. It kinda makes me think there might be some underlying ruels we're all unaware of but compelled to follow. I mean, do the gifts really cater to the individual receiving it, or are they more of a mirror reflecting what we believe would be the 'right' kind of gift to uphold certain engagements? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing, but it sure is interesting to ponder over while I'm siting here sipping my coffee. ☕️",9,1757673287.0,InvisibleMotives,0,1.0,False

1nezln8,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nezln8/industrial_espresso_machine/,Industrial Espresso Machine,"Hello! I recently dove into the world of coffee, after being a bartender and a boba shop manager, I’ve found my new passion!

I would like to get opinions on industrial 2 groups machines around the $5k-10k price range, I don’t want such of a beginner machine as I wouldn’t want to keep upgrading over and over again. I’d like to start somewhere in the middle that would allow me to accomplish high traffic volume. I’m looking into opening a little mobile cart coffee shop or trailer and move up to a coffee shop one day! Any recommendations?! Grinder recommendations as well?! 

I’ve seen online so far the:
1 - rocket boxer timer 
2 - Sanremo Zoe 
3 - Waga IO 2 

But I haven’t really seen people in videos use these

Preferences: 
(PID,cold touch steam wands, timer/programmed buttons,etc) (I don’t know what else I may need to look for! 

Ps. I’ve visited a espresso machine warehouse, where they teach classes and sell full bundles and machines, grinders, etc, but they really didn’t seem to answer my questions, as soon as I told them I’m totally new to this world, it’s almost like they wanted me to get out, they just pointed at a machine and said “that’s your best bet for a beginner” and never came back up to me. Almost seemed like annoyed i didn’t know anything, I simply came in to ask and was very blunt that I have 0 knowledge in this space. Weird. Hopefully I can get more answers here!

I have talked to plumbers and they don’t have/use any, I talked to workers at Senukai and Depo and they don’t have any. Is this not something I can easily find here? How do coffee shops have maintenance done on their coffee machines? Gonna try one more place, thanks for the help!

Edit:
I think I find some at Senukai. The silicone grease says it is good for food liquids. Thanks again!!!",1,1757672970.0,lithuania,5,0.67,False
