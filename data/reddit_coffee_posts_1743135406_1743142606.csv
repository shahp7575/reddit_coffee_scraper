1jlom3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1jlom3g/need_advice_on_my_career_projection/,Need advice on my career projection,"Hi All, 

I need some advice on what i should do with my current job and career  
I (m/32) have been working for a local government linked entity for the past 3 years as an Enginner  
  
During the time i have been working here, i had been on long MCs twice due to several medical condition i have.   
Long MCs:  
1. Year 2024 Sept - late Oct  
2. Year 2025 March - up untill start of April i will be on MC

Last year, i received a higher rating than my peers in my team, this was specifically told to me by my direct superior, who did the ratings

For this year, i was told upfront told that my rating will take a hit due to the MCs for the year 2024  
Since this year again i am on Long MCs, i anticipate my ratings next year will take a hit. 

I do feel very guilty for taking so much of MCs and causing inconvenience for the team.   
A thought has been bugging me for long to leave the current position after i receive my mid year bonus as i do not wish to burden the team. 

And i am unsure if that is a good decision. 

Furthermore, due to my medical condition of which are neurologically linked, i was not able to get a proper formal eduction. 

As such i do not have a degree or diploma let alone an o'level certificate. 

Fortunately, I am highly skilled at what I do.  
My forte and expertise is specifically focused on Unix-based systems; such as SUSE, Solaris, AIX, RHEL, Oracle, MainFrame environments. 

My experience is predominantly in non-financial critical (Life&Death) environments,   
where working under high pressure and being fast is expected 

This might sound a little weird; but This is where i am able to shine me as i am also on the autism/adhd spectrum, along side my other medical issues. and i am constantly being treated for it;

i need the job to be extremely pressurising, only than i am able to produce results or work properly otherwise, i always found myself quitting the job even before getting a new one, if you are in the spectrum as well, you'd understand what i mean or feel; I drink coffee to fall asleep, not stay awake.

However, i do not know how much in demand are my skillsets in Singapore, and what are the range in terms of compensation my skillset can i expect.  
And given that i require the role to be pressurising, what type of role do i look out for.

I had worked in the banking sector, i had quit the job in 3 weeks.   
And i am also unsure if i should leave my current role or hold on to it. 

Do you have any advice?

After the first few weeks, I started feeling like I had completely lost touch with the outside world. No structure, no sense of time, and way too much time spent scrolling on my phone.

Recently,  I realized I needed to start rebuilding some kind of connection with life again, ttrying to gradually get back to a productive state. For me, that started with building up a solid morning routine. Something small but consistent to help me feel grounded and more in control.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working for me:

‚Ä¢First thing in the morning, I open my window. It sounds basic, but getting some fresh air and sunlight makes a huge difference in how my day feels.

‚Ä¢After that, I play the NewsBang podcast. It‚Äôs quick and to the point, and what I really like is that it filters out all the noise and just gives me the facts. It also has an audio feature, so I can listen while I make coffee or get ready.

‚Ä¢ I try to journal or list my today's to-dos for 5 to 10 minutes. Just a quick brain dump to clear my head before diving into the day.

‚Ä¢Finally, I have coffee and do some light stretching. Nothing fancy, but enough to feel like I‚Äôm starting the day intentionally.

It‚Äôs not perfect, and some days are better than others, but having this routine has made me feel more connected and a little more human again.  If you‚Äôve gone through something similar, what helped you get back on track?

My last two relationships have happened very organically, I worked with my first wife, we spent a lot of time together that we end up dating then living together for 8 years, same thing with my second wife, I spent 7 years with her, I divorced her about 3 years ago, all together, I've been out of the dating scene for about 16 years, since my 2 marriages happened almost back to back.

Fast forward to last few weeks, I frequent a thrift store near my house, I go there at least once a week (I like collecting coffee mugs) for the last few weeks, there's a girl there, I've caught her looking at me from far, many times, I didn't think anything of it, I am not the most handsome guy ever, last week I went and she was at the register, I never talk to her before, I noticed she got nervous when she saw me on the line to checkout, when it was my turn, I noticed she was taking her time scanning my stuff, she tried to start a conversation with me, she asked if I had something planned for that night because I was purchasing wine glasses, she was dropping things, at some point she hit one of the glasses against  the counter and apologized profusely, she was nervous, even the guy behind me nodded at me and gave me this little smirk.

I went back today, I was browsing around and when I turned around she was there, we made eye contact and stood there frozen for what seem like minutes, I would say it was a good 4-5 seconds before she looked away and went into the back, I saw her go to the registers, so I picked up a book, whatever book I grabbed first and went to stand in the line, she was cashing out one person, there was another waiting and then me, she asked another girl to take the next guy and she called me over to checkout, she looked at the book and asked me if I was looking to get rich, I was like.....what? then I noticed the book's tittle "" habits of the millionaire mind"" I didn't know what to say, I blurted out something on the lines of "" I read this before and I want to read it again"" then she went on to tell me she likes reading books, specially self help books, I paid , she told me to enjoy my book, and I was on my way.

Now, I don't know if she's just being friendly because that's her job or if she actually finds me attractive, I don't know what to do, I don't want to say something and come off as a creep, but I don't know if she is giving me signals or its just wishful thinking, but I also don't want to take too long and she thinks I am not interested, she is very pretty, I haven't even asked her name ! lol

At some point I thought about telling her I am looking for a specific item, and giving her my number, so she can text me if she sees it in the store, that way I open a line of communication and give her an excuse to call/text, then maybe turns into a more friendly-get-to-know-you kind of conversation.

I am at a total loss, I feel like I'm new at this, I also don't want to be rejected, I don't like that feeling, plus, its my favorite store so I don't want to stop going if I strike out.

if someone can provide some advise I would really appreciate it, thank you .",1,1743141657.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

1jlocq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jlocq8/best_way_to_move_on/,Best way to move on?,"Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M, I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.  
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn‚Äôt respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don‚Äôt think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine‚Äôs Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year.

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn‚Äôt fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship. ¬†  
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

1jloc8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosscad/comments/1jloc8a/why_the_mp22s_went_away/,Why the mp22s went away,"I've had numerous people message me asking why I took down the files, and in the interest of maybe changing opinions for the better I will just answer this publicly.

I want to say first of all that I spent about 80 hours on the design, and about 3-5 hundred dollars doing the R&D. 90% of that was developing the DIY tools and process to be as user friendly as possible. And the reason I did it is because I was pretty jazzed up about how mine performed (it was noticeably quieter than my factory integral, that is widely recognized as being the quietest at 115db). Needless to say, it was a lot of work, and I think the results reflect that.

Now I know how people feel about selling STLs, so I made the whole thing open source and put all the STLs and even the original native files in a zip, and provided that free of charge. My plan was to create a step-by-step guide for making one, put it in ebook form, and then sell that. I probably put more work into that guide than I did the actual models. It's 25 pages and has 35 photos and diagrams. Is it a masterpiece? No, but this CAD monkey isn't a photographer or writer or graphic designer, and the end result served its purpose in that it held the maker's hand and took them through the process and didn't leave them clueless and frustrated.

But despite having released the highly polished, highly effective design for free, I received hateful messages basically insinuating that I was a capitalist pig and had no right to profit from my hard work. Despite literally nobody else going to that kind of effort to support their guncad files, it was explained to me that I was violating the guncad ethos by not making that free, as well.

And before you say tips, NOBODY tips, ever. In five years, I've received exactly one tip, for files that had lots of downloads, makes and good reviews. Like nobody complained about the utility of the design, quite the opposite, but despite that nobody ever tips. The same held true for the mp22s. Despite lots of downloads and a lot of praise and compliments for the design, nobody tipped a single cent. Which I already knew would be the outcome beforehand, which is why I had arrived at the model where I would make some money from the ebook. So stop gaslighting us with the whole tips nonsense; it just doesn't happen in real life.

And before you say sell parts kits, you need to understand the actual reality of that from a MECHANICAL DESIGNER'S perspective. People who are good at CAD and mechanical design are creatives, and typically don't have access to machines or have ecommerce websites, much less the time and energy to actually do that even if they did. Like you don't realize the legwork and investment of doing something like that for the average CAD monkey, not to mention the time. Like you want the creators to be CAD monkeys, businessmen, ecommerce entrepreneurs, machine shops, fulfillment and shipping, etc. Like we're already doing multiple roles as it is, being the idea guy, the CAD monkey, the mechanical designer, the R&D guy, etc. That's a lot to ask of one guy in his basement to begin with. The worst part is even if I were to go that route, someone could undercut me by at least half. Some machinist would stay an hour late at work and pump out a thousand tubes on a two million dollar swiss lathe with a tolerance of +-.002"" and sell them for less than I can buy the tube stock for. So the person selling the supplies for these guncad projects is typically not the person doing the original design work, it's typically someone who just took their IP and capitalized on it. Moral of that story is the guy who creates this stuff in CAD is NOT going to be the guy who successfully manufactures and sells parts kits.

CAD monkeys are also not content creators, for the most part. They do however create the things that content creators use to make their money. Like someone designs something, and then a youtube channel takes that thing and makes a video about it and profits off the ad revenue, and the designer doesn't see a penny of it. Because CAD people are CAD people, not youtube content creators. Creating content is HARD, it's a whole thing in and of itself.

The thing you have to realize about open source based ecommerce (like Prusa) is it takes the involvement of a lot of people. They have CAD monkeys who just sit there and model, mechanical designers who do design and R&D, they have businesspeople in marketing and sales, they have machinists to run the machines, content creators to create tutorials and such, etc. You can't expect that model to work with guncad where you just have some guy in his basement being a one man show.

You've created an ""ethos"" where everybody wins except the people who are actually doing the work and creating the original designs and coming up with the original ideas. You fully support the content creators on youtube, and the machinists and ecommerce people selling supplies that exploit those ideas, but you literally as a matter of principle will not buy a CAD monkey a cup of coffee regardless of how much work he puts into something.

This ""ethos"" needs to change. It's created a system where everybody but the people actually doing work get to profit, and the guy actually doing the work is specifically prohibited as a matter of principle from profiting from his labor, or even just getting a few bucks here and there to pay for his expenses for crying out loud. Like you'll spend days of work building this stuff, and maybe 100 dollars on filament and supplies, but you won't buy a cup of coffee for the guy who spent hundreds of hours creating that thing? In a society where we tip a guy 20% for shoving a bag of takeout over the counter?

This community also desperately needs to understand how much work it is to bring any design to a highly polished state of completion. This lack of understanding is why this space (STL sharing in general, not just guncad) is plagued by half-baked designs that have lots of bugs yet to be worked out. And that's why most things inevitably get abandoned.

What happens is the developers bring something to a state of completion that works for their needs in their specific use case, then just dump those files and ride off into the sunset. Like for example, if I just eek something out for my own use and it's not a perfect fit, I don't go back into the file and adjust the offsets by a thou at a time until it's perfect. I get out the sandpaper and make it fit and move on with my life. But if I'm doing something for other people, I don't want them to have to struggle with that kind of thing, so I go back into the file and reprint that thing until it's right. Bringing something to working prototype in hand is 10% of the work, and then polishing that into a finished product is the other 90%, and 90% of the utility of something to the end user exists in that remaining 10%. The moral of that whole story is if creators can't make any money from their work, ever, then they're not going to polish the designs. They'll get it to their own personal satisfaction, then abandon it.

If you want highly polished designs then you have to give designers the incentive to go that extra 90%. It's hard mentally, too, going that extra 90% because that's where the fun ends and the work begins. By the time you have a working prototype in hand, all the novelty has worn off. Then going back and perfecting it is tedious and arduous, and involves a lot of repetition.

To summarize, the one and only way a CAD monkey is going to profit from his hard work in this space is if you pay him for STLs. Paying someone a few bucks for their hard work isn't going to hurt the guncad community, but leaving the very backbone of the community out in the cold as a matter of principle will absolutely kill it. I really do hope things change because I like doing this as a hobby for my own personal satisfaction, and I enjoy sharing my ideas, but I'm also a guy who thinks people deserve to be compensated when they work hard to bring something of high value to the community. Like if you see enough value in something that you would spend 50 dollars on supplies and a 200 dollar tax stamp, for crying out loud the person who made that thing you see so much value in, that guy deserves a few bucks, don't you think?

P.S. the vast majority of the modeling work for these files is done in Fusion, which is not open source FYI. Like the name ""free open source software""...yea hardly anyone is actually using open source software. Fusion is free because it's a stripped down version of Inventor (i.e. if you can use Fusion you can by default use Inventor), which is a strategy to get market share over Solidworks (Inventor's main competitor).

1jlo45i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jlo45i/help_needed_with_on_going_postbreak_up_anxiety/,Help needed with on going post-break up Anxiety.,"Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M, I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.  
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn‚Äôt respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don‚Äôt think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine‚Äôs Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year.

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn‚Äôt fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship. ¬†  
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",1,1743140419.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I'm trying to figure out which brand I should get and if I need rails vs bracket, etc etc etc. I know that I fit ""enough"" in the stock seats, but having a single inch of head room would be... preferable... probably...

The owner took 87% of the tips. It‚Äôs not illegal in Alberta, and my boss took full advantage of that.

What‚Äôs worse, the money I did receive wasn‚Äôt paid regularly ‚Äì I was only given it as a lump sum when I quit, and the owner claimed he was ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù it until I left. If I had been getting that amount regularly, I would‚Äôve quit much earlier.

Just one week before my last day, the owner finally handed me an employment agreement to sign. But even in that agreement, there was no mention of the tip percentage or how much we‚Äôd receive monthly.

I was already planning to leave, but the coworker who raised the issue with me also ended up quitting.

Other illegal practices (like no break time and having someone work under a tourist visa) have already been reported to the authorities.

It‚Äôs been the most fulfilling relationship of my life‚Äîwe genuinely get along well, and she makes me happy. That said, there‚Äôs been one lingering issue that‚Äôs been hard for me to ignore: her boundaries with some of the men in her life.

For context, I‚Äôve been cheated on before, so I‚Äôll admit I have some lingering trust issues. I‚Äôve been open with my girlfriend about this from the start, and she‚Äôs always reassured me. However, I‚Äôve noticed some patterns that make me uncomfortable.

She‚Äôs part of a childhood friend group, which is great, except that she has dated, flirted with, or had crushes on half the guys in it. While I don‚Äôt expect her to cut people off over past flings, she regularly makes plans with these men‚Äîsometimes one-on-one‚Äîand won‚Äôt introduce me or involve me in this part of her life. She‚Äôll be vague about her plans or simply not mention that certain people will be there, which makes it feel like she‚Äôs being secretive.

On top of that, she has a male best friend with whom she does monthly catch-ups. The thing is, these aren‚Äôt casual coffee meet-ups‚Äîthey‚Äôre usually at very date-like restaurants. Her friend group even teases her about ‚Äúdating‚Äù him. I know this guy had feelings for her in the past, and while she insists they‚Äôre just friends, the dynamic still makes me uneasy. What bothers me most is that he doesn‚Äôt seem to do these catch-ups with anyone else‚Äîjust her.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve made an effort to be completely open. I don‚Äôt have any close female friends‚Äîjust colleagues or acquaintances, and I maintain clear boundaries with them. My girlfriend has met all of my friends and knows the people in my life. It stings that she won‚Äôt do the same for me, especially after a year of dating.

I‚Äôve brought this up a few times, calmly and respectfully, but she brushes it off. She says she‚Äôs being transparent, but the lack of inclusion makes it feel like she‚Äôs keeping me at arm‚Äôs length from a significant part of her life. Her last relationship ended because her ex struggled with trusting her around her guy friends, which makes me wonder if I‚Äôm being overly sensitive or if this is a genuine pattern.

I truly love her and want to trust her fully, but I can‚Äôt help but feel disrespected when she keeps dismissing my concerns. Am I being unreasonable for wanting her to be more mindful of these boundaries and include me more in her social circle?",6,1743140136.0,AITAH,2,0.88,False

My bf (24) and I made our first couple friends in October last year.  The husband (21) was our mutual coworker; he invited us to dinner and a game night at his house with his wife. It was a really fun night! His wife and I clicked right away, instant best friends. While the boys gamed, she and I talked and drank wine; it became our thing. 

Fast forward a week, she and I are having coffee at their apartment alone when she asks me if she could tell me something. She confided in me that her husband is abusive and also the reason she can't have custody of her kid. Absuive meaning, beating the shit out of her, constantly degrading her, with a lovely side of a psychedelic addiction...I am not the kind of person to put up with that behavior. In fact, I was ready to go to jail the next time I saw that man. I don't care who you are or what you've been through or what you're on, there is no excuse to treat anyone with that level of disrespect. Either way, I spent the next few weeks building up her confidence and getting her to understand that no one should ever have hands laid on them, ESPECIALLY her husband. You could see the change in her confidence the more we talked. She at least started verbally standing up for herself when he got into a mood. 

Fast forward maybe another month or two, and I get a call late at night. I was half asleep when my phone rang. I answered, and she is on the other line bawling her eyes out. He had just thrown her head through a glass shower door, and she was terrified. I had never gotten ready and out the door so fast; I was at her house in less than 10 minutes. Believe me, I had that man in a corner with his tail between his legs, crying like a toddler. I had my bf help her grab some clothes and shower things while I handled the husband situation. She crashed on our couch that night and the following few weeks.

Fast forward another few weeks. She's been staying off and on with us and her mom, but we're all hanging out 24/7 outside of work. Dinner and drinks almost every night, my bf and I splitting taking her to work, cooking/cleaning, and shopping (all financial responsibilities). It didn't take long for a poly relationship to be discussed between the 3 of us. She confessed that she had feelings for us and the sentiment was mutual. Whenever divorce, custody, or living situations were brought up, she always managed to wiggle her way out of the conversation. I didn't want to push her in any way, shape, or form to speed things up, but guidelines and boundaries definitely needed to be discussed. Within a week or two of testing the waters, she and I became intimate. It was only one night, but it became very evident that she was not interested in being intimate with my bf. That would be something we could work through if it hadn't been for their not being able to bond. They were friendly with each other, but even 2 months in, I felt like I was just trying to bandaid the 3 of us together. I was exhausted, working with her through her abusive marriage, comforting and working with my bf's feeling of rejection while trying to work through my own sexuality and feelings about being with a woman. Ultimately, she and I had a heart-to-heart and figured out that she only had feelings for me. We decided to end things for now and just be friends. I helped her fully move into her mom's, and we gradually lost contact.

Fast forward to the present day, about 4 months of barely speaking. My phone rings in the middle of the night while I'm at work, and it's her. She called me crying; apparently, she had moved back in with him, and he just gave her a black eye and stormed out. She didn't know what to do so she called me because I helped last time. I immediately went into panic mom mode and talked her through it. We talked for about 2 hours. She told me that she missed me and no one makes her feel confident in herself the way I do. She apologized for going back despite my relative understanding. We met for coffee the next day and discussed the possibility of us running off together and getting our own apartment when my lease ran up. I feel it's important to note that I have bipolar, and she's diagnosed with BPD. Not the trendy kind, the destroy your whole life on whim kind. Being self-aware of that, I made it known that I have no idea what my relationship would look like with my bf of five years when our lease runs up in July. That's a lot to just throw away for her to potentially go back to her husband. She was still not willing to talk about divorce or custody whatsoever. Even still, I wanted to help her out of her shit situation just maybe not uproot my whole life in the process. She asked me to help her move into her mom's house now before we make any crazy decisions. I work 3rd shift, so I wasn't able to find time when she needed it, unfortunately. Another friend ended up helping her out, and she's currently living with her mom, son, 8 siblings, ill grandpa, and stepdad. Not an ideal living situation (obviously); she's sleeping in a literal dog bed. 

I've been internally freaking out the past few weeks about this. I've been contemplating what I should do, spiraling with every possibility of what could go wrong or right, making pro-con lists, deciding if my bf's shotty work life is worth completely uprooting my relationship to run away with her. Yesterday was intense. We hung out at my apartment while my bf was at work. We talked about how living at her mom's is not working out, and she feels like she doesn't have a place to go and be herself.  She cried and ranted to me about her relationship, caught me up on what's been going on, and let me read the texts between them during the split. I kid you not, she's still babying him through the thing. ""I'm not saying we need to get divorced, but we need some time apart."" That was hard to read. She wants me to uproot everything I have, everything I've worked for, but she's still talking to her husband like there's hope. I got out my laptop and looked up some local resources in the meantime. There's a women's shelter that has openings with private rooms, free therapy and case management, housing and education programs, the whole shabang. She wouldn't even look at it. I offered to drive her, to call them for her, to give them her info so they could reach out; she was not interested. I feel like I'm giving her every ounce of help I can offer at the moment without giving too much of myself at the same time. The one comment that got me was, ""If you don't think you can leave with me, that's fine. I'll probably just go back to him."" That kind of pressure is insane. I either drop everything I'm doing to literally run away with her, or a woman and her son are going to continue to get the shit beat out of them. I feel like either way, I'm going to be the bad guy. She's the sweetest thing, and I understand the pressure of her situation, but this puts me in a horrible position. My bf is my best friend, and we've been rocky before, but we always find our way back. I feel like she seeks out the cracks in my relationship so she can pry them open and wiggle in. I'm just wildly uncomfortable and just want to back out of the friendship again, but I don't know if I could live with the guilt of her going back because of me.

Any advice would be welcomed, I feel like shit, she feels like shit, my bf feels like shit. This is a shit-fuck-stack if I've ever seen one. Alright Reddit, do your thing.",0,1743139916.0,Advice,1,0.33,False

<div>The festive season is a magical time to transform your living space, and one of the best ways to add holiday cheer is through beautiful coffee table Xmas decor. This often-overlooked piece of furniture can serve as the perfect foundation for your holiday displays, creating an inviting atmosphere for family and friends alike.

To elevate your coffee table decor, start by selecting a central theme that resonates with your personal style. Consider a rustic look with natural elements such as pinecones, evergreen branches, and warm-toned candles. Alternatively, a sleek, modern approach could include metallic ornaments and minimalist decorations that reflect a contemporary holiday aesthetic.

Layering is key to creating depth in your coffee table Xmas decor. Begin with a festive table runner or placemat as a base, then create visual interest by arranging varying heights of decorative items. For example, place a cluster of candles in different sizes alongside a few decorative figurines or a charming holiday book. This layering not only enhances the festive look but also allows for functional space to place drinks or snacks during gatherings.

Don't forget to incorporate seasonal colors that evoke the holiday spirit. Rich reds, deep greens, metallic golds, and shimmering silvers can enhance your decor scheme. Consider including a small bouquet of fresh or faux flowers that harmonize with your chosen color palette or even a unique Christmas-themed coffee table book that sparks conversation.

Finally, personalize your coffee table decor with cherished keepsakes. Items like family holiday photos, handmade ornaments, or sentimental gifts can create a heartwarming atmosphere. This blend of decor, practicality, and personal touch will make your coffee table a centerpiece of holiday joy, reflecting your unique style while inviting everyone into the festive spirit.

1jlnyq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jlnyq2/mf_the_choice/,[MF] the choice,"I'm going to tell you a story, and I want you topay close attention. Not because it's the most incredible story in the world, but because, in the end, it‚Äôs your story.

It starts like this: an ordinary man wakes up one morning, just like any other. You‚Äôre watching him prepare, looking at himself in the mirror, putting on his shoes, maybe automatically, without thinking. But what if I told you that everything he does today is being influenced by you? Would you believe me?

Because, yes, here‚Äôs where it gets complicated. The man I‚Äôm talking about has no control over his life. You‚Äôre the one deciding every single step he takes. And the strange part is that you have no idea you‚Äôre responsible for how his day is unfolding.

Look, every time he chooses a direction to walk, it's because you decided. Did you know that? That decision you thought was so ordinary and mundane... The food he‚Äôs about to order for breakfast, that coffee or tea... that was your choice.

It‚Äôs a strange game, I know. You might think I‚Äôm joking, but I‚Äôm not. What‚Äôs happening is that you‚Äôve been so immersed in your own life, you didn‚Äôt even notice that, as you‚Äôre reading these words, you‚Äôre shaping the life of another human being. His day. And sometimes, we don‚Äôt even realize what that means.

Now, I‚Äôm going to ask you a very direct question. While reading this, when exactly did you decide to follow the story? Was it because it was interesting or because something pushed you to keep going? But the real question is: Who told you this would be interesting?

Yes, what you're reading isn‚Äôt just a story. It‚Äôs an experiment. What I‚Äôve done here is play with your mind, with your expectations of a narrative. I promised you it wouldn‚Äôt be horror or mystery, but right at this very moment, you‚Äôre starting to wonder: What is this all about?

The story unfolds as you understand it. This man could have taken a different route to work, he could have stopped to look at the sea or called a friend he hasn‚Äôt spoken to in a while. But he didn‚Äôt. You decided for him, even if you don‚Äôt believe it. Every time he hesitates, it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt know whether to go left or right, and you, as the reader, are deciding his path.

Are you following me? Because this is when the story takes a different turn, one I can‚Äôt easily explain. I asked you to keep reading, and you did. But now, at this point, you‚Äôve already gotten involved. You‚Äôve already made a choice, even though you didn‚Äôt know it.

So now, the real question is: What will you do with this power?

You have control over this man, his destiny, his day. But, do you want to be the type of person who just watches? Or do you want to be aware of what you‚Äôve just done? Because right now, he‚Äôs deciding what to do with what you‚Äôve given him. And that, whether you realize it or not, changes his life.

Would you dare to change more things, or would you stay on the sidelines, like an observer, waiting for his day to unfold without doing anything?

The truth is, every day you‚Äôre making decisions like these. Maybe not over a person who doesn‚Äôt exist, but over yourself. How many times have you doubted your own path and let others decide for you without even realizing they were doing it?

Today, maybe it's the moment when you start to see things differently. Maybe you're already deciding what your day will be like. Or maybe, it‚Äôs too late to change direction.

But well, that‚Äôs another story. Not yours‚Ä¶ or maybe it is.

I walk daily and take OTC vitamins and supplements. I take Tylenol and Ibuprofen as needed for Rheumatoid Arthritis. I do not smoke or drink. I do not take any narcotics.

I have had digestive issues since birth. My parents were too poor for me to see specialists for my issues. Over the years, especially in the last decade, my problems have hit rock bottom.

My stomach takes 5-7 business days to empty and my intestines are not able to contract on their own. Finding a successful laxative to help the issue is hit or miss depending on how severe the blockage is. Reglan in IV form works better than the pill form as I guess I can assume my stomach sucks at digesting pills as well.

All blood work and stool samples were normal. Metabolic and thyroid issues were not detected and hormones are normal except for the elevated testosterone. Reproductive health is good despite the elevated testosterone. I have 5 kids with one functioning ovary/fallopian tube.

Both cholesterols were elevated, sodium and potassium were low, and folate was high.

Since my miscarriage at the beginning of March, some of my hemoglobin levels were low. My digestive issues have been happening before this miscarriage. I refuse to take prenatals and iron because they make it harder to defacate.

I did have an elevated Rheumatoid Factor, but I was diagnosed with RA back in October 2016.

CT Scan of brain was normal and contrast CT Scan of abdomen showed blockage in S shape of intestine? No blockage at the bottom. I just have internal and external hemorrhoids. I had a colonoscopy back in January of 2018 and had multiple benign polyps removed. I was 28 at that time.

I am able to pass gas most days, but having successful bowel movements is a chore. I ended up in the ER last weekend because I drank a 10 oz bottle of Magnesium Citrate and the liquid sat in my stomach for hours. I had severe heartburn and the lemon liquid I could taste as I burped it up. This is also how it works with food. I eat once a day if I take a laxative every day and can defacate. Otherwise, I will skip days of eating. If it is really bad, I will stick to liquid/soft foods.

It does not matter what I eat, my body struggles to pass it. Salads and nuts are definitely a no go. Fiber and fats are not my friends. Even if I have diarrhea, if the laxative works, my intestines struggle to contract to let the liquid out. I try not to force my poops and take laxatives every day, but stool softeners and coffee do not work. I am very well hydrated and the Dr complimented me on my clearish urine.

I have an appointment in May with the digestive doctors. Any idea what is going on with my insides?

1jlnxhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1jlnxhs/had_to_deal_with_the_most_ridiculous_bullying/,"Had to deal with the most ridiculous ""bullying"" accusation as a manager - someone not wanting to be your friend is NOT bullying, and you can't FORCE your co-workers to be your friends.","Manager of a team which is predominately middle aged employees (age range 38-51) with two younger members, Georgia (27) who was assigned to us as a grad in 2022, and ""Emma"" who is 23 and started as a grad a few weeks ago. She moved from a regional town to here (state capital) for the grad program. 

I was forced to spend this week dealing with a ""bullying complaint"" raised by Emma about Georgia. 

I was extremely surprised when HR came to me about this because I wouldn't have ever expected Georgia to bully someone. 

She doesn't really have friends on the team and she always has an excuse for why she can't come to the team Christmas party or mid year team dinner, but I get it because she's in a very different stage of life to the rest of us. A 27 year old living at home with her folks who always asks to use her annual leave at half pay (I agree) so she can go to Seoul for 10 days for a couple of K-Pop concerts, Contiki to Europe in their early summer for 5 weeks with a couple of friends *and* Peru to do Machu Picchu with her brother for 12 days has very little in common with a bunch of 40-somethings whose lives basically revolve around our marriages, raising our school aged kids, and paying our mortgages.

Despite not having much in common with the team to the point she'd rather not come to a Christmas party with us and our spouses and kids, she's not rude, standoffish, snobby, or someone whose negative attitude drains everyone or anything like that. She's very polite, she's approachable when people need to ask her something, she come in on her 2 in-office days and exchanges hellos and small talk pleasantries with everyone and then goes to her desk and just gets on with it. 

The complaint basically boiled down to Emma being upset that Georgia didn't want to be her ""buddy"" in a new city and be her first friend in a place where she doesn't know anybody and it makes her sad because moving is hard and she's lonely. 

Emma's complaints about Georgia?

- She always goes off site to meet up with friends who also work in the city on the same days and has declined to have lunch with Emma several times because of these plans, and when Emma asked if she could tag along a couple of times, Georgia said "".....uhh....we just booked for X and they're not expecting anyone else"". 

- She sent Georgia a friend request on Instagram and Facebook and Georgia responded by blocking her. When Emma asked about it, she said ""Nothing personal, I just don't add anyone from work to my social media because I like to kep my work and personal lives seperate, sorry"". 

- She's asked Georgia a few times if she would get a drink or dinner after work, and Georgia always declines because it's ""been a long day"" and she ""just wants to get home"". 

- Whenever she tries to make small talk with Georgia or ask her things about the city, she seems kinda ""annoyed"". 

- When she asked about things like finding a good doctor in the city, Georgia was ""really dismissive"" and told her the grad program is good for that as she did it a 3 years ago and while she was local to here, other grads said they were really helpful with helping with the move to the city. 

Because Emma raised all of this as a bullying complaint, I had to investigate it alongside HR and it felt like a joke and SO unfair to Georgia. 

I haven't seen Georgia be rude to Emma at all in a work capacity. If anything, she has gone out of her way quite a few times to help her with things that are new to her. 

Georgia was forced to defend herself to HR from the ""crimes"" of wanting to spend her unpaid lunch break catching up with friends instead of having lunch with a co-worker, not wanting to add a co-worker to her personal private social media accounts, not wanting to socialise with a co-worker in her personal time and expense, and not wanting to turn her lunch with her friends into an awkward lunch where she was kinda forced into bringing the new girl along, especially without getting to ask them if they'd be OK with Emma tagging along. 

HR asked Georgia if it ""would really have killed her"" to be friends with Emma on Instagram which is INSANE to me. 

I too have the boundary that I don't add co-workers to my social media. I don‚Äôt want my co-workers to have any access to me outside of work or see snippets of my private life. I want to be able to use it freely among family and friends without having to consider how the things I post would be received by people I work with. This is particularly pertinent to me as I am a Greens voter and certified hater of Peter Dutton while my manager is a very open supporter of the Liberal party. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I have to censor myself in my personal life/space/time. 

Would it be nice if Georgia befriended Emma a bit knowing she's new to the city and is clearly a lonely and looking for some camaraderie with the person around her age? Of course. It would have been nice of Georgia agreed to having lunch one day or having a quick coffee with her or something, but she isn't OBLIGATED to do that. Yes, Georgia has to be polite and professional to Emma when working together, but it's not Georgia's responsibility to basically be Emma's ""buddy"" in a new city and hold her hand finding a GP and hang out with her outside of work when she wants to go home.  

I've seen a lot of discourse on this sub between the ""I want to be social at work to make it less miserable since I spend most of my week with co-workers"" and ""I‚Äôm here to do my job so I can get paid and go home. I‚Äôm not here to make friends and you don‚Äôt exist to me outside of business hours"" camps, and you can have opinions on that either way, but I will say the first group of people can‚Äôt really force the second group of people to be their friends or social outside of work hours. 

I now have have to manage any anger or discomfort Georgia now feels at being subject to rather unfair accusations of bullying because she didn't want to add the new girl on Facebook and bring her into her personal friend group and am kinda annoyed about that tbh. HR is basically wanting me to try and encourage Georgia to be a friend to Emma which, well, I don't see that happening, because it's pretty clear after yesterday that Georgia now basically hates Emma for ""getting her into trouble"" because I told her she go home early after the meetings because she was upset and as she was leaving, she ""accidentally on purposely"" knocked Emma's bag off her desk and glared at her. I've never seen Georgia look even irritated with someone before, let alone that angry. 

I messaged Georgia today (wfh) telling her to just take it easy and gave her an easy task and told her she she's done for the day and I'll talk to her on Monday but not to panic because she's not in trouble, but I'm dreading having to deal with this. Georgia now has to try and take the high road with someone who got her into some trouble for a really unfair reason, and HR wants Georgia given a warning for this, and I now have to deal with fighting that because no, Georgia does not deserve that.

But yeah.......those of you who are in the ""I want to make friends at work because it makes the day go by faster"" and whatever? Please understand that you can't force everyone to feel the same or force someone to be your friend and just leave people who don't want to be your friend alone. Someone not wanting to be your friend isn't bullying, and your co-workers don't have to add you to instagram or go have drinks with you.",58,1743139690.0,auscorp,38,0.99,False

Congrats mate, you overachiever! But hold on‚Äîkya tu sach mein ready hai iss MBA ki life mai....Let‚Äôs find out! ü§î

1. **Brush Up on Basics** 

* *Quantitative Skills*: Revise Percentages, Probability, Statistics, and Financial Math. Calculator chhod, dimaag lada!

2. **Build a Strong Foundation** 

* *Read Business News Daily*: Economic Times, Mint, Business Standard‚Äîbecause ‚ÄúI saw it on Instagram‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid source in class.
* *Understand Current Affairs*: Politics, economics, industry trends‚Äîsab par nazar rakh, taaki discussion mein ‚Äúhaan ji, theek hai‚Äù se kaam na chale.
* *Get Comfortable with Case Studies*: HBR is your new Netflix. Binge those case studies like they‚Äôre true crime documentaries‚Äîonly with more spreadsheets and fewer serial killers.

3Ô∏è. **Networking & LinkedIn Optimization** 

* *Connect with Seniors & Alumni*: Beg for wisdom (and maybe their old notes) before they block you for asking about ‚Äúplacement secrets.‚Äù
* *Update Your LinkedIn Profile*: Ek badiya si photo daal (bina selfie wali pouting ke), headline mein ‚ÄúFuture CEO‚Äù likh, aur thodi si angrezi phenk!

* *Specialization Clarity*: Marketing, Finance, HR, Operations‚Äîpick one before someone assigns you ‚ÄúChief Coffee Fetcher‚Äù by default.
* *Set Career Goals*: Short-term: survive the first semester. Long-term: survive the student loans.
* *Research Internship Opportunities*: Stalk your dream companies like a rom-com protagonist, but with less charm and more LinkedIn DMs.

6Ô∏è. **Practical Preparations** 

* *Formal Wear & Essentials*: Buy blazers, ties, and shoes you‚Äôll wear twice before switching to hoodies and existential dread.
* *Laptop & Software*: Get a beastly laptop that can handle 17 tabs, MS Office, and your inevitable meltdown at 2 a.m.
* *Financial Planning*: Budget for fees, ramen noodles, and that one emergency coffee when your soul leaves your body mid-term.

7Ô∏è. **Relax & Recharge** 

* *Spend Time with Family and Friends*: Hug them now‚Äîsoon they‚Äôll only recognize you as ‚Äúthat blurry figure on video calls.‚Äù
* *Take a Vacation*: De-stress somewhere sunny before ‚Äúvacation‚Äù becomes a fancy word for ‚Äúnapping between lectures.‚Äù
* *Enjoy Your Hobbies*: Paint, game, or binge-watch‚Äîbecause hobbies during MBA? LOL, good one.

So I decided to just give it a go, hipefully it turns out well and can make some connections or at least A connection haha.

To start off I am 31 and I live in Los Angeles, California and its kind of hard to date here when everyone looks like an influencer/super model and well...I look like me. I am Mexican, 5'10, I have brown hair that I like to comb backwards and its kind of long now(needs a trim). Definitely Brown but not dark or light skinned definitely in the middle. Brown eyes with a mustache and goatee and on the heavier side but I have been trying my best to eat better and I have seen some noticeable progress.

Now for hobbies I guess I like to hang out with my friends, play video games(FPS like Apex Legends, Destiny 2, Halo, CoD and not an FPS but I love playing Genshin Impact). I love cooking and make some amazing food mainly mexican food but I like making Italian, Chinese, American food i guess you could say and any recipes out there that look tasty and worth making. I love watching tv and movies, like anime(Naruto is my fav series), some action tv shows, animated tv series like Invincible, King Of The Hill, Family Guy etc.

Going out to eat is pretty cool too like kbbq, taco stands(i know a spot), or more chill to grab some boba or coffee is great too and walk around the city(for my long distancers i'll walk while we facetime haha)

And lastly for music I like a lot of kinds but I guess the main ones I like best are Death Metal, rap/hip hop, Jpop, Anime intros.

I dont really know what else to say really. I just want someone to talk to and be there for me as I would for you whoever it is. And I hope it can lead to something, distance does not matter to me any woman is welcome. I appreciate anyone reading this to read the ramblings of a lonely dude and whatnot. and if you read it just let me know with a movie/tv reference of your choice :) oh also i love The Sopranos...my fav tv show!

1jlnr2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jlnr2o/how_long_does_this_last_and_is_this_normal/,How long does this last and is this normal post-break up?,"Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M,  I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship.  
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn‚Äôt respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don‚Äôt think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine‚Äôs Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. 
The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year. 

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn‚Äôt fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship. ¬†  
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine.  Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance! ",1,1743138994.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

l've been with the church for almost a decade and a half now. Nasa loob pa rin ako, at isa akong servant. 

Ngayon, bat ako nandito? Una na gusto ko malaman anong meron dito baka naman paninira lang, pangalawa nagsawa na sa paulit ulit na texto at lintek na recap na yan. Recap na nga sa una tas sa huli recap na naman ni bro rodel. Ka sawa na sa totoo lang, walang katapusang recap. Pa ikot ikot na lang. Bat di pa kasi alisin yang recap na yan at wala naman sustansya or iklian man lang nila. 

Isa pa yung napansin ko na maluluhong pamumuhay ng nasa taas. Meron pang nag aalaga ng panabong hahaha hindi mo alam kung matatawa ka o magagalit sa kaboboha nila. Puro patarget pa, minsan nakakahiya mag salita sa pulpito ang ending kallangan ng ganito ganyan. Nakaka awa ang mga opisyales, kasi sila at sila ang abonado. Nung nakaraan may umalma ng GS ang sabi nya dahan dahan naman, isa- isa lang. Walang katapusang pa target. Lahat negosyo nila. Ang gagaling. 

Isa pa tong sis nag punta sa concert, dito ako na trigger na hindi na tama ito. Ang daming kapatid na naglalakad lang papuntang lokal. makapag abuloy lang, ni hindi makabili ng luho makapag bigay lang sa gawain, tapos makikita mo kundi naka multi million na motor o sasakyan pupunta naman sa mga concert na halos libo libo din halaga. 

Hindi ba sila nahihiya nyan? Ang daming di ma aayos na Icl pero nakapag donate tayo ng coffee shop at dormitory????? It doesn't make sense mga kapatid. Nakakapighati ito. llan na ba sa na destinuhan kong ganito ang ayos ng Icl karamihan RENTA? 20 plus years or 10 years na yung Icl renta pa rin? At kada bwan problema ang renta. Kung sana mag karoon ng Icl store ang bawat Icl at dun kunin ang renta eh kaso hindi eh lahat sa central napupunta. Kaya walang maka ahon ahon satin.

My first month was crazy. I set up project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined how our team updated weekly reports. My manager was impressed and called me a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù because I set up automated reminders for overdue tasks.

Then things slowed down. Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù requests.

For meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (granola) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a ‚Äútechie‚Äù for doing that. Man, I don‚Äôt even like tech that much.

Last week, my manager asked if I remembered a decision we made two months ago - I typed a keyword into my second brain setup (saner) and had the answer for him right away. And he asked me whether I have ‚Äúphotographic memory‚Äù. Sir, I don‚Äôt even remember my friends‚Äô birthday.

Most of my time is now spent appearing busy. I keep a detailed GDoc page open during Zoom calls so it looks like I‚Äôm working hard

I am 40h into a sudden 36h self-imposed fast.  Ate a tin of sardines in (sunflower) oil with sliced tomato after lifting at the gym on Wednesday night.  Two cups of unsweetened black tea yesterday and today + tap water.  Accidentally took one tumeric capsule (for knee-joint pain management, which is not an issue at this time).

I'm a man in my late 30s, and like a lot of people these days, I‚Äôve been feeling a bit isolated. I‚Äôm single, naturally introverted, and pretty shy‚Äîso meeting new people doesn‚Äôt always come easy. But I‚Äôd really like to change that.

I‚Äôm hoping to find some regular social activities where the goal is to actually connect with others. I know there are heaps of things going on in Melbourne, but I'm after something that‚Äôs both welcoming and centered around shared interests‚Äînot just a one-off event, but something with the potential to build ongoing friendships.

A little about me:

I‚Äôve got a PhD in U.S. history, so I love big ideas and thoughtful conversations.

I‚Äôm curious about art and art history‚Äîit's something I‚Äôd love to explore from scratch.

I'm a big film fan and try to make it to Melbourne Cinematheque regularly (amazing, but I find it a bit hard to meet people there).

I play music and played in a few bands in the past, which was a great social outlet, but that‚Äôs harder to organize as life gets busier.

I‚Äôm also dabbling in economics lately and wouldn‚Äôt mind a regular, relaxed chat over coffee about the state of the world (without it turning into a fiery Twitter thread IRL).

I‚Äôm open to book clubs (though I read a lot for work), discussion groups, gallery tours, music meetups‚Äîanything where people go specifically to meet others and hang out regularly.

If you know of any groups or activities like that‚Äîor if you're in a similar boat and would like to start something‚Äîplease reach out! Would really love to hear your ideas.

Thanks

Additional Perks & Features:

	‚Ä¢	Food & Beverage Discounts ‚Üí Members get 10-15% off on food at partner caf√©s.

	‚Ä¢	Referral Rewards ‚Üí Refer a friend and both get an extra free coffee.

	‚Ä¢	Loyalty Rewards ‚Üí Visit 5 caf√©s and earn a bonus reward (e.g., a free pastry).

	‚Ä¢	Digital Membership ‚Üí No physical card‚Äîjust scan a QR code to redeem.

	‚Ä¢	Partner Benefits ‚Üí Discounts at bookstores, co-working spaces, and more.



Why It Works:

By 2022, the Department of General Services (DGS) reported plans to relinquish or had already relinquished about 767,000 square feet of leased space, resulting in annual savings of approximately $22.5 million.  Ôøº

In 2023, DGS coordinated with 40 state departments to consolidate space across 132 leases, aiming to cut an additional 1.16 million square feet and achieve approximately $35 million in yearly savings.

Overall, these initiatives represent a total reduction of approximately 3.5 million square feet of leased office space since the pandemic began.

## What is Egyptian Cotton Paint and Why is it So Popular?

Egyptian Cotton paint falls into the category of neutral paint colors. It is typically described as an off-white paint, warm white paint, or light beige paint. The appeal lies in its ability to create a serene and inviting atmosphere. Unlike stark, clinical whites, Egyptian Cotton has a subtle warmth and depth that makes it exceptionally livable. Its versatility allows it to complement a wide range of decorating styles, from modern minimalist to traditional farmhouse. The creamy white paint quality means it is not too cold and can bring out the colors of furniture in a complementary way.Essentially,egyptian Cotton acts as a blank canvas that highlights the other elements in your room. This makes it a safe option for those who are indecisive or unsure which color palette they should opt for when designing their home. It tends to be one of the modern paint colors that continues to stay in trend.

## Understanding the Undertones of Egyptian Cotton

While generally considered neutral, Egyptian Cotton paint isn't a single, monolithic color. Different brands formulate their own versions, resulting in subtle variations in undertones. Some may lean more towards a warm yellow-beige, while others exhibit a slightly pinkish or greyish cast. Understanding these undertones is crucial for ensuring the paint complements your existing d√©cor and lighting conditions.

Natural light plays a notable role in how a paint color appears. in a room with predominantly cool light (north-facing), a warmer Egyptian cotton with yellow undertones can help to prevent the space from feeling cold and sterile. Conversely, in a south-facing room with abundant warm light, a slightly cooler version can help to balance the intensity and avoid an overly yellow appearance.

## Who is Choosing Egyptian Cotton Paint?

Egyptian Cotton paint appeals to a wide audience, each seeking something slightly different from their paint color choices:

*   **Homeowners:** Often seeking advice on interior paint, for bedroom paint colors, living room paint colors and dining room paint colors. Homeowners might potentially be engaged in DIY painting, or need paint colors for small spaces, so will need paint samples to determine which one to pick. They can benefit from reading reviews of the best paint brands for Egyptian Cotton to find out the right choice.
*   **Interior Designers & Decorators:** Professionals rely upon interior design paint or designer paint in their work. They may have trade paint accounts they use with options for commercial paint discounts. They use paint swatches and require paint specifications when it comes to different projects. They may need the best neutral paint colors for interior designers and may have to consult on paint sheens.
*   **Contractors & Painters:** Professionals have a focus on applying paint. they may need to provide exterior paint but will need to consider professional paint costs alongside contractor paint prices.They also factor in product facts such as paint application techniques, what paint sprayer or paint rollers to use or consider attributes such as durable paint, easy to apply paint and washable paint. Due to their experience they will need to factor in best paint for high traffic areas and paint coverage per gallon to stay within budget.
*   **Renovation Enthusiasts:** These individuals are highly engaged in the latest home improvement trends. Therefore, they require color match paint and reviews on Egyptian Cotton paint alternatives. To assist them in their choices, they will consult a paint visualizer to see how suitable it is indeed and look for paint ideas to see how others have approached design. They will prioritize the best neutral paint for resale even if they do not plan to move. They may even seek luxury paint brands or eco-pleasant paint such as low VOC paint alongside specific choices such as matte finish or eggshell finish.

## Top Egyptian Cotton Paint Picks for 2025: A Brand Comparison

Several leading paint brands offer their own interpretations of Egyptian Cotton. Here's a look at some of the top contenders,considering their unique characteristics and suitability for different applications:

*   **Benjamin moore:** While not explicitly named ""Egyptian Cotton,"" Benjamin Moore offers several colors that closely resemble the popular hue. Colors like ""White Dove"" or ""Ballet White"" share similar warmth and versatility, making them excellent alternatives. Benjamin Moore is renowned for its high-quality pigments and durable finishes. Their Regal Select line is a popular choice for interior walls, offering excellent coverage and washability.

*   **Sherwin-Williams:** Like Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams does not have an named ""Egyptian Cotton"" paint. Though, they offer a wide selection of neutral colors, thus, similar alternatives such as ‚ÄúCreamy‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlabaster‚Äù can achieve a similar look. Sherwin-Williams‚Äô Emerald line provides exceptional stain resistance and durability, so you may consider it as durable paint.

*   **matte Finish:** Matte finishes have the least amount of sheen, creating a soft, non-reflective surface. They are ideal for bedrooms and living rooms where a subtle, sophisticated look is desired. Matte paint can hide imperfections well but is less washable than other sheens.

## DIY Painting Tips for Achieving a Professional Finish

1.  **Surface Preparation:** Nonetheless of its type,you must start with a clean,smooth surface. Fill any holes or cracks with spackle, sand the area smooth, and prime the walls to ensure proper adhesion.

2.  **Quality Tools:** Invest in high-quality paint brushes, rollers, and painter's tape. Cheap tools can leave streaks and uneven coverage, requiring more coats of paint.

3.**Proper Technique:** Apply the paint in thin, even coats, using a consistent rolling or brushing technique. Avoid applying too much pressure, which can cause drips and splatters.

4.  **cutting In:** Use a small, angled brush to ""cut in"" around the edges of the walls, ceiling, and trim. This will create a clean, crisp line and prevent the paint from bleeding onto adjacent surfaces.5.  **Multiple Coats:** Apply at least two coats of paint to achieve full coverage and a uniform finish. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.

6.**Proper Ventilation:** Ensure adequate ventilation while painting to prevent the buildup of fumes. Open windows and use a fan to circulate the air.

Depois de consumir 4 pacotes de 250g da Astral em precisamente 35 dias, chegaram esses Hyuga. Vamos ver quanto tempo os 2 pacotes ir√£o durar? üòÇ

Aos que j√° provaram esses Hyuga: 
- quanto tempo de descanso recomendam?
- dicas de receita e preparo na v60? 

*Ja tive problemas com fermentados no passado. Estou com medinho de pular de 2 lavados + 2 cerejas para esses 2 Hyuga de fermenta√ß√£o anaer√≥bica. Pensei em moer mais grosso e/ou usar agua a 92 nas primeiras receitas.

**Ponto negativo nos pacotes Hyuga: nao informam o n√≠vel exato da torra. Nisso a Astral d√° um show.

***Se gostei da Astral? O fato de 1kg ter durado pouco mais de 1 m√™s responde kkk. 
Meu preferido foi o et√≠ope Explos√£o de Papaya (apesar de ser torra M√©dia para moka/espresso, fiz apenas na v60 e adorei). 
Estrela do Patrick e Flor da Eti√≥pia praticamente empataram em segundo lugar. 
Em ultimo, mas sem dem√©rito, fica o Oferenda de Piraj√° (√© muito bom, notas interessantes e ex√≥ticas, mas o menos divertido dos 4). 

****Dicas para os Astral? 
No Kingrinder K2 estacionei entre 100 e 120 clicks. Talvez muito alto, mas tenho baixa toler√¢ncia a amargor. Tentei 80 clicks inicialmente e foi demais pra mim.
Como metodo usei apenas v60 (4:6 adaptada para menos agita√ß√£o, jogando agua mais alto para quebrar a turbul√™ncia na superf√≠cie e/ou fazendo apenas 3 ou 4 ataques).

*****off topic: How would you translate ‚Äúto brew a cup of coffee‚Äù to portugu√™s? Cozinhar fica tosco. Seria a melhor tradu√ß√£o ‚Äúpassar um caf√©‚Äù? Por via da d√∫vidas e para n√£o discriminar os m√©todos n√£o cis-pour over, vou jogar f√°cil e seguir falando ‚Äúfazer um caf√©‚Äù üòÇ

Pronto, chega de asteriscos!

Ps.: aceito dicas para os pr√≥ximos caf√©s! vou precisar comprar mais 2 pacotes pra garantir os pr√≥ximos 30 dias.

Coffee lab lan√ßou c√°psulas, sempre bom ter uma desculpa para comprar os pacotes deles - mas to querendo dar prioridade pra torrefa√ß√µes que n√£o conhe√ßo, nas que eu deveria conhecer m. Quais as melhores do Brasil na sua opiniao? (Ps. dentro do ps.: nao to a fim de gastar 150 reais por 250g. Geralmente pego um pacote mais foda e outro mais b√°sico, meu limite para extravag√¢ncias √© 80/250g - a n√£o ser que seja africano, colombiando ou algo do tipo)

Ps. 3: J√° provei essas torrefa√ß√µes aqui, sem ordem de prefer√™ncia, citando os que me marcaram positiva ou negativamente:
- coffee lab (minha torrefa√ß√£o de refer√™ncia desde 2013, me tornei viciado em caf√©s especiais quando experimentei um Catuai 81 do Espirito Santo, pura goiaba - a descri√ß√£o era cheesecake de goiaba)
- King Caf√©s (gosto muito de v√°rios pacotes, todo mundo deveria provar o Cocadinha e o Danoninho. Mas, no geral, enjoo r√°pido e come√ßo a achar artificial. Alguns meses depois estou viciado de novo üòÇ)
- academia do caf√© (√≥timo, mas n√£o me impressiona tanto)
- tocaya (muito bom, mas perfis pouco interessantes)
- fuzz (odiei tudo)
- dora (gostei, mas tb n√£o foi dos meus preferidos)
- moka club (achei bem ruim)
- Intelligentsia (Melhores gr√£os que j√° provei, sem discuss√£o. Junto com o Cheesecake de Goiaba do Coffee Lab, um Eti√≥pia do Intelligentsia marcou minha mem√≥ria l√° pra 2016, o garoto exalava lichia, muita lichia - chego a suspirar s√≥ de lembrar, e olha que faz quase 10 anos isso).

But here's the story! Hope you like it.

General silver paced around the navigation room, picking at his claws nervously as he tried to regain communication, it had been 9 days since they heard from the leader of Troup five, saib, no clue what happened, one moment he had been on call with saib playing cards while discussing plans for dealing with the agent gold, something the emperor, code name jade, didn't approve of but that didn't matter really right now. When the camera cut out but before the audio cut out, he heard saib scream and something that sounded like a chuckle and a blade being drawn. Since then there's been no trace of him, can't track his ship, trackers were probably cut. Silver signed and took a deep breath, moving over to the console and calling Ames, the director of the detective core. He heard her voice as her video clicked on, she was confused, it was the middle of her shift, he usually didn't interrupt it, so what was up? He of course hadn't told her yet, he didn't know how but he needed to know. She asked, ""why are you calling in the middle of a shift? Is something wrong? Also have you seen saib he was supposed to get back to the new shipment of coffee from his planet, called earth, I think? I'm exhausted."" He sighed heavily and said, ""we have a bit of a problem and it involves saib..."" Ames responded immediately, ""whats the problem? Normally he's chill? What did he decide to teach the cubs glitter instead of proper defense techniques again?"" Silver says, ""I'm afraid it's a little more serious than that sadly. He's gone missing. 9 days ago. And we think agent gold might be involved."" Ames jumps up from her seat practically yelling now, ""what?! Why did nobody tell me! We need to find him! We all know what agent gold can do to him especially with what he knows! Agent gold wants what he knows! And he won't stop until he gets it!"" Silver sighs, ""yes. I know. Nobody knew how to tell you."" Ames says, ""wait... How do you know if agent gold is involved?"" Silver says quietly feeling the weight of his confession weighing down on him, ""I was on call with him when it happened. His video cut out and before the call went off I heard him scream..and a chuckle then a blade being drawn.."" Ames, ""no. Tell me you're joking."" Silver says, ""I am not. This is a serious matter.""

I find myself thinking about it often. Not because of the food--which was good--but because of the strange atmosphere inside. I don't think it would be possible to replicate. 

The entrance led down to a large room that was lower than street level, but not quite a basement. It was filled with big round tables, but I never saw another customer there.

I don't think I even saw anyone coming to pick up an order or heard someone calling.

The dining room actually looked and felt more like being in some random person's unfinished basement. It had brown shag carpeting, white stucco walls, a glittery popcorn ceiling, and a large old TV set that would always be playing some kind of daytime television like Judge Judy or Maury. The remote would be lying out on a table, and the volume at full blast. 

There were a few arcade machines set back in a closet with the door removed, random cups of dried up coffee sitting on card tables, power tools laying on the carpet, and piles of old newspapers strewn all over the tables. The only decoration was a large stone gargoyle. 

The guy who ran the place was a character. He basically dressed like a pirate, with a colorful bandana, extremely baggy clothing, and random chains attached to his jacket and pants. He talked like a professional wrestler, yelling everything dramatically in a deep, booming voice. 

Apparently his sister worked there too. I never saw her, because she was always back in the kitchen. I'd hear them yelling every time I was there. Their discussions were interesting--things like whether Superman could beat Hulk. 

I didn't mind that the owner smoked heavily in the dining room. What I did mind was the time that a large, slobbering mastiff appeared in the kitchen doorway and trotted into the dining room. 

I stopped going back after that. 

This man ran the pizza place for at least 25 years, and I remember it being this way since it opened. 

I don't know how he did it. 

I recently visited my hometown and asked around to see if anyone knew why it finally closed. 

I was told that the owner wanted to buy a luxury car, so he sold his pizza place. I found this confusing. 

I don't know why, but I feel a deep sense of otherworldly coziness when I remember the atmosphere in there. I can almost smell it. 

I hope that guy and his sister are doing OK.

I had visited a cafe the day before and as we were walking home last eveniong I saw that they had made some freshly baked cakes. It would be nice for my coffee so went in a bought one. When I had to pay, I only had much less or a much bigger bill. The smallest one that would cover the price was 200,000 and the young girl in there could not find the 100,000 in change.

I offered to let the 200,000 be there and I could return today for the change. But she refused to accept that, and she thought it was better if I would come back today and pay. 

I will go back as soon as they open to pay my debt, but where in the world would this happen other than here in Vietnam?

1jlmw7p,https://i.redd.it/rfaxh4wnxcre1.jpeg,Shady SR800 hack,"This is kinda shady, but I accidentally discovered a way to greatly increase temperature control with the SR800. I usually roast coffee on my stove top so I can use the vent hood over the stove. One day I had started preheating my oven to bake something, and then I remembered I wanted to roast coffee at that moment. So I gave it a shot. Basically what happens is the warm air rising up from the oven gets sucked into the roaster which allows you to very rapidly achieve as high of a coil temp as you would ever want. Then you can leave your fan speed higher for more agitation so you get a more even roast. I have gotten dramatically better roast results ever since stumbling across this trick. I don't think it's dangerous since it's just moderately warm air rising up from the oven below, it's not like I have the stove burners turned on. I know it seems pretty sketch but it works great.
