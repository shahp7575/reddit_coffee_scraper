1oo041z,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1oo041z/what_did_you_realize_wasnt_cheaper/,"What did you realize wasn't ""cheaper""?","Taco seasoned ground meat isn't cheaper than buying ground meat and taco seasonings separate because draining taco seasoned ground meat means losing flavor vs. draining the fat before adding the seasoning + water. For <$1 more, seasoning itself tastes much better and isn't money down the drain.

I've been trying to move away from plain pasta. It may be $1-2 a box, but that's only until I factor the sauce + ground meat into the cost. At least with something like boxed mac and cheese and Knorr rice sauces, the sauce is included in their roughly $1-2 price tag and even after added canned veggies/tuna still don't end up with endless amounts of leftovers, so this month I stockpiled on Knorr pasta/rice instead.

I bought popcorn kernels months ago because ""It's cheaper than buying microwave bags"". Then I realized I was constantly buying popcorn seasonings, which is still $3/piece. And I use a lot of popcorn seasoning, so I only convinced myself I was ""saving"". Actual saving would've been using only canola oil and maybe butter (I'd get an air popper but don't want too much stuff either).

I switched from powdered to liquid coffee creamer because I was still running out of powdered quick. The added convenience of liquid is worth it because it's already sweetened and cools my coffee down (vs. still having to run my faucet when using powdered creamer). Though I probably should stop buying coffee altogether and spend what I'd normally spend on cofree + creamer on drink mix packets.

It's not oversimplified as ""lower price tag = cheaper"", because you've got to factor the cost of everything altogether.",1,1762237085.0,budget,0,1.0,False

The hum of the engine and ship systems, the dim lights of the quarter's ""night mode"", and the subtle noises of the ship's secondary crew always seemed to keep him up at the worse possible time. Times like now, when he needed his rest for the upcoming mission.* 

*His ship, the USS Bogatyr, had been tasked by Starfleet to investigate reports of Romulan sightings within the Neutral Zone, as well within Federation space. Thankfully there hasn't been any reports of attacks involved with these sightings as of yet, and most of Officers stationed in the nearby stations view the rumors as hoaxes spread by the colonists hoping to add a bit of excitement in their life. But Artyom felt in his gut that something was going on, and that it would soon reach a boiling point if it wasn't stopped soon.*

*His much needed relief from pretending to sleep. ""Vaskey here, go ahead,"" he said as he started to change into his uniform, moving to his replicator to order something to help him stay awake.*

*Artyom couldn't help but smile slightly as he grabbed his coffee, adding a little extra kick to it as he finished readying himself. Of course Kullau is here. She had always been close by, even when he was at the academy. If he was a superstitious man, he might think that fate had bound them together. Luckily for him, he was more of a paranoid man, and felt that Kullau* *had wanted to find new ways to keep tabs on her little ""pet project"".*

When I met her, she already had a boyfriend who, according to her, didn’t care about her and only used her for sex.  
I was that “I can fix her” type of guy — you know, the one who thinks he can treat her right and show her what love really is.

I’m currently studying to get a better job, and she works in HR.

We actually met at a consulting company — she was the HR there, and I had just joined. At that time, she still had that boyfriend, but there was also this other guy at her office who seemed *a little too involved*.  
She told me that he used to buy her gifts and take her out for coffee a few times. She insisted she wasn’t attracted to him, that he was just being persistent and she didn’t want to be rude.

A few months after we started dating, she confessed that she and that guy used to kiss on the cheeks and hug often.  
When I asked her why she never told me this before, she said it’s because she thought I’d judge her and that she was “a little” attracted to him since her boyfriend at that time didn’t give her attention.  
So basically, she admitted she flirted for attention.  
That was the **first incident** — and it created a small crack in my trust.

Now, fast forward to a few months ago — she was working at a different company.  
Her boss (who’s married and has a kid) was kind of flirting with her, though she claimed she didn’t notice. When I checked their team chats, she was also being a little flirty with him, letting him do her part of the work, and accepting chocolates from him during her periods.  
He even used to drop her home sometimes after work.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that, and after a small argument, she said she’d tell him not to drop her anymore.  
But one day, I went to surprise her at work… and saw him dropping her off again.  
When I confronted her, she said she “forgot” that I had told her not to let that happen.  
That was the **second incident**.

Now, this one isn’t a big deal but it still says something: in our entire relationship, she’s only bought me one gift. I’ve given her plenty, even though she earns and I’m still studying.

Then I started learning more about her past — and honestly, it was hard to digest.  
She’s had a pattern of starting flings at work, saying it excites her to keep things secret.  
She lies often to get out of tough situations.  
She’s had physical relationships with a few of her childhood male friends — sex with two, made out with one, and still keeps in touch with another as “just a friend.”  
so, I figure she has no boundaries and once she told me when we were working at the same workplace that after being friend with someone for few weeks having fun talking laughing   
she always matching the vibes she felt attracted to that person that her natural yah she told me that   
She even used to send Snap streaks in her bra, showing cleavage, just to get attention.  
She doesn’t have any female friends now.  
  
And to be honest, even our sex life isn’t great. Once she's done, she just lies there — no effort, no affection, nothing.

Then comes the **third incident**.  
She recently got a remote job, and there’s this new guy who’s clearly flirting with her — asking for her Insta, sending Snap requests, etc.  
I later found out that during her free time, instead of calling me, she calls *him*.

Now I’ve also found out she’s into some kind of virtual exhibitionism — like showing her body online (without showing her face).  
I’m really not okay with that.

Recently, she even said she’s okay with a threesome — specifically, two girls and one guy.  
I guess it's just to push so in future I can do same for her by letting her do threesome with me and some dude and her   
I told her straight up that’s never going to happen.

Despite all this, she says she loves me, wants to go for couple’s therapy, and imagines a future with me — kids, marriage, everything.  
But something feels off.

I feel like she doesn’t actually love me for who I am — she just sees me as the “good guy” who’ll always accept her no matter what.   
She calls me smart, responsible, and kind… but it feels like I’m more of a future investment to her, not a real partner she’s emotionally loyal to.

Also, the whole threesome thing? I think of this quite often her ex (the guy she really into but he doesn't give a fuck about her) she never would've asked him for a threesome  
knowing how jealous type she is, it’s weird she’s suddenly okay with “two girls and one guy.”

Anyway, that’s the gist of it.  
There’s more to the story, but I think this gives a pretty clear picture.

I am going to die alone

Im going to wake up one day at 50 years old on a twin bed while everyone I know is happy with someone and Im just going to sit there, not making coffee for or saying good morning love to someone

Im just going to sit there pretending to wonder where I went wrong while actually knowing the answer

All the people I love tell me Im worthy of love, that Im beautiful and I’ll find someone

I will say Im happy for them, and I will genuinely be happy for them but underneath I will hide all this jealousy and hatred because if I am beautiful, if I am worthy of love why can I not find someone that loves me romantically for more than 6 months?

The sun is so grey and even on the days that I wake up and say to myself, “wow, I can’t believe how beautiful it is right now” I end the day crying

Or I cry in the middle of the day

In the middle of dinner

In front of the people I care about

On my birthday

Because I cant hold it in

Why wont someone other than my friends (or my own family, who are essentially obligated to say so) tell me I’m beautiful?

Why do I have to lay here and cry next to someone that loves me?

Why cant that be enough? 

Why cant the love of my friends and family be enough?

Why do I feel so empty when I should feel so full?

I want to love myself

I really really just want to love myself

But I feel so worthless

All the people that try and help, all the people that give me good advice, all the people who truly want me to feel better

I take their advice and do nothing with it

Why do I do this?

Am I just lazy? Is that who I am at my core?

A lazy slob who lets a breakup catapult me into an intense depression that makes me want to end my life? Am I that sad?

At one point in time I did love myself

For about 1 year I could look at the negative, self deprecating thoughts and say to them, “I don’t want you, you aren’t representative of who I am as a person” and they would go away. Not for good, but they would leave me alone for a while and I could do it again

But now my brain assaults itself and I don’t have the fortitude to tell it off

Should I take acid again?

Should I do 2 ounces of shrooms so I just dont feel like a person again?

That was the only time I loved myself or had any hope for my future

No other meds have worked

I try to give them time but nothing changes

I try to change myself but nothing changes

I feel hopeless and I don’t know if I’m just not trying hard enough or if I’m truly at my limit and I don’t know which is worse

There are so many good people in the world

So many kind and wonderful and skilled people that genuinely want to help

But I feel like I will never be one of them because I can’t pick myself up, I can’t allow myself to be supported by other people

I feel like an energy suck in this world

The kind of person that other people try to avoid

And I’m just lucky to have the people I do have, they are the only reason I haven’t jumped in front of a train yet

I stay alive for them but I don’t feel alive

I feel like shit

My head hurts and my heart is confused

I love myself

I love you

I love myself I promise I love myself

I love me

I love being me

I love my mistakes

I love my success

I love my past love and my future love

I will say these things soon enough

Because I’m saying them now

I love you

There are thoughts of financing an expedition to find plants like coffee.

But I don’t really understand it. 

From what i understand/believe so far:

It’s an empire. There is trade. Can’t Jin (pr some other cultivator) just run to the next major city? You can probably buy stuff from all over the empire there. (Eg in ancient rome, you could buy anything from the known world, and some stuff from beyond)

Or: The AJTC trades with the rest of the empire. They could probably just give the next caravan drawings of the stuff Jin wants, and say they are willing to pay well, and the caravan after that would bring coffee plants.

In any case, creating a big&slow&expensive expedition comprised of vulnerable mortals seems weird when you can send a single cultivator, who can also travel a lot faster.

*Incense, bulgarian rose, orris, coffee, calamus*  
*Amber, opoponax, myrrh, styrax, immortelle, cedar*

Shortly after spraying this on for the day, I got my partner to take a whiff, and his first impression was that this is “smokey and fruity.” That’s a succinct way to describe it off the bat, but in my opinion this is the most complex of the five Grimoire offerings.

Reading the notes, I had a feeling this would be lower down the list of what I would enjoy from this collection, but right away I was struck by how complex and refined this is.

The top notes are what made me most hesitant, but I am pleasantly surprised to find that they provide a charming earthy tone. I believe the cherimoya brings through the delectable fruitiness that is both sweet and somewhat tropical, while the spices create the impression of wandering through an unfamiliar spice market, surrounded by produce and wares from far off places. This top layer brings me back to the sensation I experienced when I sampled Todorac, where there was an element of liquid booziness woven through the composition - I can’t even begin to understand why I’m experiencing that now, but nonetheless it’s delightful.

The combination of middle notes is absolutely beautiful. There’s something very special about the incense and rose together; it brings a touch of romanticism to this scent that you wouldn’t expect. This isn't a new or unique duo by any means, but it's rendered in a way that feels divine. The orris adds a soft, powdery veil that gives elegance and emotional distance, while the coffee and calamus create a robust depth. This heart forms an atmosphere that feels meditative and timeless, like smoke rising through the still air of a dimly lit temple.

The base is very dense: balsamic sweetness, tar-like smokiness and a leathery edge that I find comforting. Cedar keeps everything dry and poised. When inhaling deeply, a metallic current travels up the back of the nose and further into the throat - and this is where I clearly understand the perfumer’s note (check the website) that the myrrh lends a blood-like quality that cuts through the heaviness. It might sound off-putting to some, but to me it’s thrilling! It breathes life into the creation.

Add all of this together and I am struggling to find the right words to describe this perfume as a whole. It’s both spiritual and corporeal, restrained yet emotional. There’s a quiet melancholy that reminds me of paintings from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, where themes of inner struggle, spiritual unease, and isolation are expressed through beauty. Dark concepts captured in sublime ways. *Catoblepas* is the olfactory version of that experience.",1,1762236116.0,fragranceaustralia,0,1.0,False

Its pretty simple -

1. Upload your syllabus (AND course calendar), the app makes an API call to convert it into a calendar of your assignments and readings.
2. You can click on the assignments/courses and add relevant context to them.

​🖤 CHAPTER ONE — The Last Day of the Cross-Eye Killer

​There are mornings the world wakes quiet, not peaceful, but hushed, as if holding its breath. This morning was a bruise across the sky.
​Gray light, heavy and smeared, bled across the window of her foster mother’s car. Dew clung to the glass like frozen tears, refusing to fall. Mia Bennett sat rigid, her stomach twisting in the specific, sickening way she’d only ever felt once before—the night everything in her life shattered.
​Today, she would watch the man who murdered her parents die.
​The road ahead was a pale, empty ribbon dissolving into a fog that felt less like weather and more like judgment. Closure should have been a wave of relief; instead, each mile wound something cold and hard around her ribs, waiting to squeeze.
​“You doing okay, sweetheart?” Carol, her foster mom, asked gently, her voice breaking the thick silence.
​Mia nodded, but her nails dug crescent moons into her palms. “Yeah,” she lied, the word scraping her throat. “Just tired.”
​Carol had kind eyes—tired, but genuinely kind. She squeezed Mia’s hand once, a brief anchor. “You don’t have to be strong today. Not for me.”
​“If I fall apart now,” Mia whispered, staring straight ahead, “he wins.”
​They said his real name like it mattered: Daniel Mercer. But to the world—to the terrified parents who double-checked their locks, to the media, and to Mia—he was only The Cross-Eye Killer.
​And to Mia, he was the thing that stood beside her bed when she was eight. He wore a paper-white mask with a forced, childlike smile and two crude, black X-marks where his eyes should have been. That image wasn't a memory; it was a brand, permanent and hungry, burned into the lining of her nightmares.
​The prison rose from the fog like a promise abandoned by God. Steel, concrete, razor wire. A place where hope died years before the prisoners did. Carol shifted, uneasy, as they approached the gate.
​“It looks less like a prison and more like a mausoleum,” she murmured.
​Mia didn’t answer. She felt it before they even parked—a sudden prickling on her skin, a drop in her stomach, like the instant before a fall. Something wrong. Something waiting.
​A metallic sound echoed from deep within the structure—a faint, dying hum against steel. It faded fast, but it left a cold, oily trace behind. Mia rubbed her arms.
​“Just nerves,” she insisted, her voice hollow.
​But it didn't feel like nerves. It felt like a current. A warning.


​🪑 CHAPTER TWO — The Last Word


​The walk through the facility felt like moving through pressurized water. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in a relentless, unnatural rhythm. The halls were sterile, but Mia could feel the residue of old fear trapped in the concrete.
​The viewing chamber was colder than the corridors, a room designed to contain and extinguish life. A thick pane of glass separated them from the final stage—the electric chair, gleaming metal straps waiting.
​Her friends were already seated. Lily, the stoner girl, normally full of careless energy, looked small and pale. Alex, her boyfriend, was quiet, his jaw set in a protective line. Next to him sat Jax, tapping his knee restlessly, and Cass, gentle sunshine in human form, whose eyes missed nothing. They had insisted on coming, refusing to let her face this alone.
​When the guards wheeled Daniel Mercer into the chamber, the air sucked out of the room. He wore no mask—prison had stripped him of that power years ago—but in Mia’s mind, the white face clicked into place. She saw him strapped in, head restrained, and instantly saw the pale smile, the X-eyes empty and hungry.
​He scanned the witnesses slowly, his gaze finally snapping onto Mia. His lips twitched. There was no terror in his eyes. Only recognition.
​A priest offered murmured prayers. The warden leaned in, asking for final words.
​Daniel’s voice slid out, smooth and venomous, hitting the glass like broken glass.
​“Death is not a prison. It’s a doorway. And I walk willingly. I would sell my soul to the Devil himself if it meant I could do it all again.”
​A shiver of genuine terror, far colder than the room, ran through Mia—before the switch was even thrown.
​Then came the flash.
​The man’s body jerked against the restraints, muscles seizing grotesquely. Sparks danced. The air filled with the sickening scent of hot copper and burning things. Mia didn't blink. She waited for him to disappear.
​But as his body slumped lifeless, a flicker moved behind his eyes—not physical, not earthly. A hateful, incandescent spark, like something stepping out instead of fading away.
​And in that instant, Mia knew: This was not over. This was the beginning.


​🏃‍♀️ CHAPTER THREE — The X-Mark


​The world outside the prison felt wrong, like a clock that had skipped a crucial beat. The sky was dull. The sunlight had lost its conviction. Mia tried to blame trauma, stress, the inevitable psychic debris of witnessing a state execution.
​The next morning was supposed to be a return to banality: school, lockers, coffee. Instead, Mia woke with the clinging darkness of the prison. Every time she blinked, the mask, white and smiling, with its twin X-eyes, was there, waiting for the game to restart.
​“Morning!” Lily burst through the bedroom window—a cheerful, slightly clumsy raccoon. “I brought breakfast.”
​It was cheap cereal bars and a borrowed lighter, but it worked. Mia laughed, tension cracking slightly.
​They sat on the roof, smoked, and shared comfortable silence. For a moment, she felt safe. Like maybe nightmares couldn't climb higher than the eaves.
​But school felt like a trap. The hallways were claustrophobic. Every reflection in the glass seemed to contain a shape that vanished when she turned. By third period, her breathing shook. She walked home, leaving the sterile halls behind, and collapsed onto her bed.
​She woke to the dream: the prison lights flickering, the smell of burnt wire. Through the shadow, the figure stood—the mask glowing.
​“Did you think a cage could hold me?” the voice whispered, though the smile on the mask never shifted. “The door opened. And I stepped through.”
​She gasped awake, sweat chilling her skin.
​BANG.
​A face at her window. She screamed—until the figure laughed.
​It was Lily. “Girl, your scream almost peeled my eyebrows off.”
​Mia shoved her playfully. “You’re evil.”
​“I’m prescribing you two hits,” Lily announced, producing a joint.
​They returned to the roof, sharing warmth and the smell of autumn. Mia leaned against her friend, feeling her heartbeat slow to a normal rhythm. She felt anchored.


​🩸 CHAPTER FOUR — The Discovery


​Morning sunlight was pale, weak. Lily was cross-legged on the floor, applying mascara with mismatched socks, humming off-key.
​“Seriously,” Lily paused, brush mid-air, “if reincarnation is real, I wanna come back rich and completely irresponsible. Like, someone who buys expensive dogs and then forgets their birthdays.”
​“You already forget everyone’s birthdays,” Mia said, pulling her hair into a messy ponytail.
​“Yeah, but imagine doing it in a penthouse.”
​Mia smiled. These were the moments that convinced her the world was still worth the fight. They grabbed backpacks and walked to school with shared earbuds and comfortable silence, Lily bumping her shoulder once, then twice.
​“Dude. You’re smiling. Like… voluntarily.”
​“Shut up.”
​“Just checking. Also, hey… I know yesterday sucked. I’m here. Always, okay?”
​Warmth swelled in Mia’s chest. “I know.”
​And she did. That was why what came next would be the ultimate proof of his victory.
​The Track and the Trap
​The track smelled like autumn and damp earth. Lily stretched dramatically, complaining.
​“My body wasn’t built for athleticism,” she whined. “It was built for napping and snacks.”
​Mia laughed. “Try not to die out here,” she called, shouldering her books.
​“Psh. Me? I’m immortal.”
​Mid-warm-up, Lily landed wrong. Pain shot up her ankle. Coach waved her off. “Locker room. Ice it.”
​She limped across the field, annoyance replacing humor. The hallway inside was unnaturally cold. The fluorescent lights hummed. Lily paused, her breath hissing between her teeth.
​“…Hello?” Her voice was swallowed by the emptiness.
​She pushed into the girls’ locker room. Metal lockers. Chlorine. The sound of a dripping shower. She grabbed the ice pack, placing it carefully on her ankle.
​And then—the sound of air being displaced. A whisper of movement.
​She froze.
​“Coach? Mia?”
​Silence.
​Then, a shimmer in the mirrored locker doors. At first, a shadow. Then, sharp.
​A figure.
​The white mask. The childish smile. The two crude, black X’s for eyes.
​Her body turned slowly, her mind struggling to process what her eyes already knew. He stood behind her. The mask tilted, waiting.
​“No,” Lily whispered, her voice a thin thread. “You’re dead. You’re—”
​The blade flashed.
​She stumbled back, screaming. A hot, tearing line split her arm. She kicked wildly, connecting with something hard, sending the figure stumbling. She ran—limping, scrambling—
​He grabbed a metal equipment rack and slammed it down across her legs.
​Metal crashed. Lily screamed as pain tore up her side and ribs. The sound bounced off the tiles—hollow, hopeless.
​She clawed for air. He stepped closer, the knife gleaming, reflecting the buzzing lights overhead.
​“No—please—” she sobbed, voice raw. “Mia—”
​Steel fell. Again. Again.
​Wet impacts mingled with the grunts of effort. Lily tried to crawl, her fingers leaving streaks on the tile like fragile red brushstrokes.
​The mask leaned down. The X-eyes stared, a sick joke carved into innocence.
​And then, everything went still.
​The Display
​Mia left class when the phones started flashing and the whispers turned to shrieks. Fear spread like wildfire, funneling everyone toward the auditorium.
​A physical knot formed in her chest. No.
​“What’s happening?” she grabbed a passing student.
​“Someone’s hurt. They said… someone from the track team.”
​The world muted.
​She shoved through the crowd, her feet moving on their own. She burst into the auditorium, then stopped, her breath catching like a snagged hook.
​The stage.
​Bodies were backing away, their faces bleached with a horror that transcended shock.
​Lily.
​She was displayed on the stage, clothes torn, blood dark against the wood. She had been arranged, posed with ritual precision. And over her closed eyes, drawn in thick, unmissable crimson—
​Two X’s.
​Mia’s scream ripped from somewhere ancient—a noise of disbelief and primal grief.
​Her vision swayed. The stage lights flickered.
​And in that impossible, terrible blink, she saw that mask.


Chapter 5: Loss and Fear


​In the quiet cocoon of their room, Ethan and Sarah dressed in somber blacks, preparing for the day they dreaded. The air was heavy, not just with grief for Lily, but with a terrifying truth Ethan had to share.
​""You need to know,"" Ethan murmured, meeting Sarah’s gaze in the mirror. ""Mia... our whole group has been haunted for years. The killer, the Cross-Eye Killer—he’s real.""
​He recounted the chilling history: the killer's unsettling, mismatched mask, the brutal signature, the years of silent dread. Sarah listened intently, her face draining of color as the abstract tragedy became a chilling, personal threat.
​Ready, they stepped out to join Mia and Jack next door. As the four walked toward the church, a figure caught their attention. Chad, a notoriously awkward classmate, stood unnaturally close to their path. He lingered, eyes shifting nervously, casting uneasy, almost possessive glances at the group before quickly looking away.
​The funeral was a suffocating tableau of sorrow. As Lily’s casket lay before them, Mia’s eyes swept the crowd, drawn by a prickle of primal fear. Far in the distance, near the edge of the cemetery's dense trees, she saw it—a flash of white mask with the two crossed, vacant eyes. It was a fleeting, sickening presence that vanished before she could draw a full breath, leaving her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs.
​Later that evening, gathered for a strained dinner, the killer was the unavoidable topic. ""The way Lily was displayed,"" Jack began, his voice rough.
""It couldn't be him,"" Mia insisted, shaking her head sharply. ""The Cross-Eye Killer is... different. This felt too theatrical.""
Ethan picked up on her fear. ""A copycat, then? Someone trying to use his shadow?""
The terrifying possibility settled over them like a shroud: the killer was not one ghost from the past, but possibly two sinister shadows lurking just out of sight.
​Their uneasy discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Sheriff Kimora. His presence was meant to be reassuring, but his careful, scrutinizing questions only amplified their doubt. The night ended with their unspoken fears taking root, setting a tense, precarious stage for the days ahead.


​Chapter 6: Second Strike


​The day after the funeral, school felt oppressive. In the classroom, the tension broke instantly when Mia faced Ashley and Taylor.
​""Look who it is,"" Ashley sneered, eyes glittering with malice. ""The poster girl for grief. Or should we say, the girl who brings the killers out?""
Taylor leaned in, whispering cruelly, ""Everyone knows you ran in the same circles. Are you sure you weren't helping him, Mia? Maybe Lily found out your little secret.""
​The cruel accusations hit Mia like a physical blow. She tried to defend herself, but their words were a torrent of spite.
​Just as Mia's composure shattered, a commanding voice cut through the noise. Miss Honey, their charismatic teacher, moved with elegant speed, stepping between them. ""That is quite enough,"" she stated, her voice low and dangerous. ""Ashley, Taylor. You will both drop this immediately. Push Mia one inch further, and I promise you, you'll be joining Tom in detention—for the rest of the semester.""
​The threat was palpable. The girls shot Mia a final glare, but begrudgingly backed down, and the classroom atmosphere cooled to a simmering resentment.
​After school, the group retreated to Tommy Burgers to decompress. Settled into a booth, Mia's friends enveloped her in support. Ethan, Jack, and Sarah took turns offering solid, unwavering reassurance. They knew the truth; they stood with her.
​The mood started to lift, until the bell above the door jingled, announcing Ashley and Taylor’s entrance. Sarah, still burning from the morning's injustice, saw red. With a flash of fierce defiance, she stood up. She grabbed her thick chocolate milkshake, marched over to the oblivious tormentors, and hurled the frigid liquid—not waiting for it to melt—directly at them.
​The milkshake exploded over their faces and designer clothes, drenching them completely. Ashley and Taylor gasped in shock, dripping and seething. Without a single word, Sarah turned and stormed out of the restaurant, leaving a stunned silence in her wake.
​Back at school later that night, the classroom was empty except for two people. Miss Honey and Tom had stayed behind. Their playful flirtation quickly deepened, moving toward a passionate intimacy fueled by the day's stress and the shared isolation.
​But their stolen moment of connection was shattered by the cold reality lurking in the shadows. With brutal, sudden force, the Cross-Eye Killer struck. Tom’s life was taken in a horrifying instant, leaving Miss Honey stumbling back, covered in blood, stunned and utterly vulnerable as the killer’s cold, crossed eyes locked onto her.


Chapter 7: Shadows and Whispers 


​The school halls, usually a bright, chaotic rush of lockers and gossip, felt like a refrigerator in November as Ethan, Mia, and their friends rounded the corner. The cheerful morning light couldn't penetrate the gloom pooling around the janitor’s closet. There, slumped against the cinderblock, was Miss Honey.
​A collective gasp died in their throats. Her eyes—cold, vacant—were marked with the sickening, familiar etched cross. But it was the symbol carved directly into the wall beside her head that chilled them to the bone: a jagged, complex knot of lines they’d never seen before.
​The sudden blare of sirens ripped through the quiet horror. Police tape quickly sealed off the scene. As the officers began their inquiries, Chad, the perpetually twitchy classmate, loitered at the edge of the crowd, his eyes not wide with fear, but gleaming with an unnerving, almost possessive intensity.
​Ethan and the others were pulled into separate interviews, but they kept their minds racing, focusing on the symbol. Later, huddled together with old library books and smuggled online records, they made the terrifying connection. The symbol wasn't random; it was a key. It was part of an ancient, dark ritual—a desperate practice designed to pull a malevolent spirit, the Cross-Eye Killer, back from the void.
​They found references to a ""vessel,"" a living conduit necessary for the killer's return. The realization hit Mia like a physical blow, leaving her breathless. As the sole survivor of the original spree, she was inextricably linked to the killer’s dark obsession. She was the vessel.
​Ethan slammed a heavy text shut. ""Look at this,"" he said, his voice tight. ""The ritual requires the killer’s mark to be placed on the victim's body. It’s not just a signature—it’s an anchor. With every new body, with every cross, they're not just killing. They're binding the spirit closer to the vessel.""
​The air in the room seemed to solidify. The killer wasn’t just coming back; he was using their friends to forge his way back through Mia. They had to move faster than they ever imagined, because the stakes were no longer about catching a murderer—they were about saving Mia’s soul.
​In the girls' locker room, the air was thick with humidity and the smell of cheap perfume. Two oblivious preppy girls, Lacey and Chloe, were focused on their post-gym gossip. ""He didn't even text me back,"" Lacey complained.
​Suddenly, the fluorescent lights above flickered and died, plunging the room into a deep, heavy darkness. The girls froze, annoyed more than frightened.
​In that brief, absolute blackness, a flicker of movement passed across the reflective surface of a large mirror. It was the swift, distorted image of a person, their eyes marked by a blinding white cross, gone almost before it registered. The lights snapped back on. The girls were alone.
​""Ugh, this place is so ancient,"" Chloe griped, grabbing her shirt. They never even noticed the shadow.


​Chapter 8: Gaining Ground 


​The cafeteria was nearly deserted, the evening sun casting long, pale shadows across the empty tables. Mia and Alex sat close, the quiet a fragile shield around them. Alex took her hands, his touch warm and grounding.
​""We’re going to get through this, Mia. We are a team,"" he said, his blue eyes unwavering. ""I promise you, nothing will happen to you as long as I’m here. I won't let it.""
​Mia felt a genuine, fragile smile start to form.
​That was when the moment shattered. Chad materialized beside their table, his presence an immediate, heavy intrusion. ""Hey,"" he mumbled, rocking on his heels. ""I couldn't help but overhear. Are you guys really looking into the Cross-Eye Killer stuff? I have a database that could help—""
​Alex stood up, his posture instantly protective. His voice was low and firm. ""Chad. We are dealing with something serious right now. Please, give us some space.""
​Chad recoiled slightly, sensing the raw tension, but his lips twisted into a strange, tight smile before he finally backed away, disappearing around a pillar.
​Later, in Ethan’s cramped room, the last rays of sun slanted across his desk, illuminating a chaotic collage of newspaper clippings, crime scene photos, and police blotters. Ethan and Sarah sat shoulder-to-shoulder, their heads bent over the evidence.
​Ethan jabbed a finger at a faded, chilling headline. ""Look at this, Sarah. It’s the original case. The killer wasn't cornered. He wasn't shot. He walked into the police station and turned himself in. There's so much we don’t know about why.""
​Sarah traced the lines of the text, her brow furrowed. ""It's unsettling. What if he turning himself in was part of the plan? And now, someone is mimicking him... or worse, continuing his work because he can’t?"" As they dug deeper, sharing theories and connecting seemingly random details, the intensity of the investigation drew them closer. A powerful, intellectual spark was igniting between them, born out of shared fear and fierce curiosity.
​Alex needed to clear his head. He slipped into the otherwise empty boys' locker room and hit the shower, letting the rush of hot water wash away the day's paranoia. Steam quickly filled the humid space.
​As he reached for the soap, he felt a profound, sudden chill that cut through the steam. He spun around, heart hammering. Nothing. Just nerves, he told himself, taking a deep breath.
​He turned off the water and began to towel dry, finally relaxing. He reached into his locker for his jeans.
​Then, there was a faint, scraping sound from the shadows near the equipment cage. Before he could turn his head, a heavy, dark blur shot toward him from the side. A medicine ball, thrown with incredible, devastating force, struck him directly in the temple.
​The world exploded in white light and then blackness. Alex crumpled to the floor, his head hitting the tile with a sickening thud, leaving him alone and unconscious in the silent, steaming room.

On a cold full moon night in London. A man stumbled out of the pub in a drunken mess. He doesn't see the shadowy figures atop the building. A tall menacing silhouette riding a broom, amethyst eye looking down. “You gonna come down so we can talk, darlin?” The drunken man  shouted while looking at the Amethyst eyed witch with a distinctive American accent. His own eyes are a shimmering sapphire blue.

“You always spoil my entrances, Billy.” The Amethyst-eyed witch pouted. “You're a long way from home, cowboy. Here for little old me?” She asked just before a revolver aimed at her face. “Oh Darling, I don't  have time for pleasure!” Her face twisted into an unhinged smile, her eyes glowing even brighter.  
Billy immediately backed down, putting his gun away. 

“Then what do you want? You have been pretty quiet for the last decade. Is it because of him?”

The Amethyst-eyed witch looks upset, losing her smile entirely. “He’s at Hogwarts now, but something doesn't feel right. I have been watching, he's doing well.”

Billy looks sceptical, studying her body language and behavior. “Then how come you don't  look happy?”

The witch’s hands trembled in the cold wind. “I visited him, he looked like he didn’t recognize me…”

Billy’s brow furrowed. Before he could say anything more, she kicked off the rooftop, broom slicing through the mist as she vanished into the London fog … leaving only the faint echo of her laughter, and the smell of rosewater and smoke.

The night swallowed her whole.

…

A scream tore through the dark.

Silvers jolted upright, only to find himself strapped to a chair, arms bound tight against iron restraints. The room around him pulsed with shadows and whispers. His breath came in sharp, panicked bursts, each one frosting in the chill air.

“W–where am I? Who are you?!”

Hooded figures circled him, their faces hidden beneath deep, black hoods. Their wands glowed faintly… tips aimed squarely at his head.

“The subject shows signs of instability,” one murmured, voice cold and clinical.

“Proceed with obliviviation,” said another.

“Wait…!”

A blinding white flash consumed everything.
He woke with a gasp, sweat pouring down his face, chest heaving as moonlight filtered through the dorm window. For a moment, he didn’t know where he was, only the echo of that white light burned behind his eyes.

For a few seconds, he just sat there, staring at his trembling hands. The echo of voices still clung to the edges of his mind.

""The subject shows signs of instability...""
""Proceed with Obliviviation...""

He swallowed hard. The words still felt real.
“Rough night?” came a quiet voice.

Silvers turned. Across the room, Crow Olivander leaned up from his bed, tousled hair catching the dim light. His wand floated lazily beside him, illuminating a faint violet glow.

Crow rubbed his eyes and sighed. “You talk in your sleep again, mate. Cry, too.”
Silvers froze. “What?”

“Yeah.” Crow’s voice was calm but edged with concern. “Third time this week. You keep saying the same thing… ‘where am I… who are you?’ Then you wake up like someone’s hexed you.”

Silvers didn’t answer. He just looked down, fingers digging into the sheets.

After a beat, Crow muttered, “You sure you’re alright? Because whatever’s haunting you … it’s not just a bad dream.”

Silvers met his gaze, and for a fleeting moment, the moonlight caught in his mismatched eyes — one red-silver, the other yellow. They shimmered like fractured glass.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” he whispered. “But it feels like something’s… missing.”

Crow opened his mouth to reply, but the sound of screaming laughter echoed through the corridor outside.

A loud bang! followed, then a voice shouted, “HAZEL MILLER! PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW!”

Crow groaned and flopped back on his bed. “Morning’s here.”

***

Morning came in chaos.

By the time Silvers and Crow made it to the Great Hall, Hazel had already turned breakfast into a full-blown circus. Half the Gryffindor table was covered in pink foam, and a squad of enchanted teacups was dive-bombing first-years like angry hornets.

At the center of it all stood Hazel, hands on her hips, smirking like she owned the place while Peeves floated above her, clapping gleefully.

“Beautiful work, Miss Miller! Positively artistic!” Peeves crowed.
Hazel grinned up at him. “Coming from you, that’s like winning a bloody award.”

The poltergeist saluted midair. “A menace of taste and vision!”

Professor McGonagall swept in, her face already tight with fury. “Peeves! Hazel Miller! I will not have this kind of…oh, for Merlin’s sake, what did you even do?”

Hazel shrugged. “Just a little charm experiment gone… sideways.”

Crow leaned toward Silvers as they slipped into their seats. “She’s been here three months and already has a fan club … and Peeves’ respect. You realize that makes her the most dangerous witch in this castle?”

Silvers managed a tired smile. “She’d probably take that as a compliment.”

Across the hall, Hazel winked at them before McGonagall started handing out detentions.

***

By the time lunch rolled around, the chaos of Hazel’s morning “experiment” had mostly settled though a few teacups still buzzed nervously around the rafters like guilty pigeons.

Silvers, Crow, and Hazel sat in Professor Avery’s lecture on Magical Genetic Traits, a course known for being more theory than spectacle. The classroom smelled faintly of parchment and wet ink, sunlight cutting through the high windows.

Professor Avery, a tall, sharp-featured wizard with graying hair and perpetual coffee stains on his robes, adjusted his spectacles as he spoke.
“Now, many of you have heard of Metamorphmagi, witches and wizards who can alter their appearance at will. Such talents, though rare, are inherited rather than learned.”

He began pacing, his wand lazily tapping on his palm. “Their transformations are typically full-body; hair, face, even bone structure. However, sometimes…” He paused mid-step, turning his gaze toward Silvers’ eyes changing color with every blink. “Sometimes, the trait manifests in a limited form.”

Silvers froze as every head turned toward him.

Professor Avery gestured with his wand. “Mr. Silvers, if you would be so kind, look up.”

Silvers did, uneasily. His mismatched eyes, one a glimmering spiral of red-silver, the other a vibrant yellow caught the light. Every blink is a new combination of the three colors. A quiet murmur rippled through the class.

“You see,” Avery continued, “his color changes aren’t cosmetic but emotional. Quite fascinating, really. An instinctive response rather than conscious transformation. Most frequently, we’ve documented red-silver and yellow, correct?”

Silvers nodded awkwardly. “Uh… yeah, I guess.”

Crow raised his hand from the back row, smirking. “I’ve seen them turn pink once.”

The class laughed, and Silvers flushed. “That was because you hexed my tea, you git!”

Hazel grinned from her seat beside them. “Pink suits you, though. Makes you look less like a haunted painting.”

Silvers’ eyes immediately turn pink at Hazel’s comments. 

Even Professor Avery cracked a smile. “Be that as it may, emotional-color metamorphosis is an extraordinarily rare manifestation of the Metamorphmagus trait. Keep an eye on this one, no pun intended.”

The class laughed again, and Avery moved on to a diagram of wizard bloodlines. Silvers exhaled quietly, resting his chin in his hand.

He tried to tune out the chatter around him, but his thoughts drifted elsewhere.

Back to that strange warmth he sometimes felt watching the moonlight.
Back to the echo of a voice; soft, teasing, “You always spoil my entrances, Billy…”

The memory wasn’t his. It couldn’t be. But it felt real.

For a moment, the air shimmered faintly around him.
Crow blinked and straightened in his seat. “Uh… mate?”

Hazel squinted. “Whoa. Your eyes are…”

“...purple,” Crow finished. “Like… glowing amethyst.”

Silvers looked up, startled. The reflection in his ink bottle confirmed it, twin violet lights staring back at him, alive with something ancient and familiar.

Professor Avery paused mid-lecture, noticing the shift. “Well, that’s new.”

Hazel leaned closer, grinning. “So, Professor, what emotion makes that happen?”

Avery frowned, clearly intrigued. “I couldn’t say. It’s… unprecedented.”

Silvers didn’t answer. His pulse quickened, his thoughts a haze of confusion and half-remembered whispers.

Somewhere deep inside, a voice, hers whispered like a lullaby in his mind.

“Don’t be afraid, my little light…”

***

The glow in his eyes slowly dimmed back to red and yellow.

The rest of Professor Avery’s lecture passed in a blur. Silvers couldn’t stop thinking about the flash of amethyst in his eyes, or the voice that had whispered to him like it knew him.

Hazel noticed his distant stare as they packed their books. “Alright, moody, come on. I’ve got something that’ll clear your head.”

Silvers blinked. “What kind of ‘something’?”

She smirked. “The fluffy kind.”

…

The sunlight slanted through the trees, dappling the moss and soft grass. Nestled in a small clearing behind Hagrid’s hut, a tiny unicorn foal lay curled up in a bed of straw. Her coat shimmered gold-white, her horn barely more than a nub.

“Goldilocks,” Hazel whispered with a grin, crouching beside her. “Still as pretty as always, girl.”

Silvers knelt beside her, eyes softening. “Her wounds are healing nicely.""

Goldilocks blinked up at him, curious but unafraid. Her little hooves twitched as she shifted closer, pressing her nose against his hand.

Silvers couldn’t help but smile. “Guess she’s not scared of me.”

“Why would she be?” Hazel said, gently brushing the foal’s mane. “Unicorns can tell, y’know. Who’s got good in them.”

Silvers chuckled quietly, the tension in his shoulders finally easing. “Don’t tell anyone, but I think she’s the first creature here that doesn’t want to hex me.”
Hazel smirked. “Give it time. She’s young.”

They worked together, cleaning Goldilocks’s bedding and mixing a warm feed under Hagrid’s instructions (and occasional booming laughter from inside his hut). The foal nibbled at Hazel’s sleeve and sneezed glittering motes of magic onto Silvers’s robes, earning another laugh from him.

For the first time in days, his smile didn’t feel forced.
Hazel noticed and nudged him. “See? Better than brooding about your mysterious eyes, huh?”

“Yeah,” he admitted. “Way better.”

Goldilocks gave a happy little whinny, her horn glimmering faintly.

Silvers reached out to pet her again, and for just a second, his eyes flickered not red, not yellow, not even amethyst, just a calm, steady silver light.

Goldilocks snorted softly as she drifted to sleep, her golden mane shimmering in the fading light. The forest had gone quiet, only the wind in the leaves and the slow rhythm of the unicorn’s breathing.

Hazel leaned back on her hands, glancing over at Silvers. “You’ve been a mess all day,” she said. “Even more than usual. Wanna tell me what’s chewing at your brain?”

Silvers hesitated, tracing circles in the dirt with his finger. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”

“Mate,” Hazel said with a grin, “I’ve seen a poltergeist do stand-up comedy and a frog burp fire. Try me.”

He laughed under his breath, but it faded quickly. “It was… a dream. Or maybe not. I was strapped to a chair. Couldn’t move. There were these hooded wizards all around me, talking like I was some kind of experiment. Then there was this white flash, and I woke up screaming.”

Hazel’s smile vanished. “That’s … yeah, that’s not your run-of-the-mill nightmare.”

“I know,” he said quietly. “It felt real. The sounds, the smell of metal… even the cold. I can still feel the straps on my wrists when I close my eyes.”

Hazel sat forward, elbows on her knees. “Have you told Crow?”

“He already worries enough,” Silvers muttered. “He says I talk in my sleep, cry sometimes. But this, this felt like a memory. Like something that actually happened to me.”

Hazel watched him for a long moment, eyes softer than usual. “Then we find out what it is,” she said simply. “Whatever’s messing with your head, we’ll dig it out together. You’re not doing the tortured-mystery-boy routine alone, got it?”

He managed a small, grateful smile. “You always make it sound so easy.”

“Easy? Nah.” She smirked and flicked a straw at him. “Just more fun when I’m involved.”

Goldilocks stirred, brushing her muzzle against Silvers’s sleeve. He stroked her gently, the contact grounding him.

“Thanks,” he said. “For this. For… everything.”

Hazel shrugged. “Don’t thank me yet. I still expect you to do my Potions homework.”

He laughed again, and this time it was genuine. The forest felt lighter somehow, the weight on his chest easing, for now.

Goldilocks stirred as the last light of day faded behind the trees. Hazel brushed her gently, humming under her breath while Silvers cleaned the feeding trough. Each stroke of the brush sent flecks of gold drifting through the air like tiny sparks.

“Alright, that should do it,” Hazel said, setting the brush aside. “Her mane’s smoother than your hair ever was.”

Silvers smirked. “I’ll try not to take offense.”

As Hazel turned to gather their things, Silvers noticed a few fine strands of unicorn hair caught in the bristles of the brush, glowing faintly in the dim light. He hesitated for a moment, then carefully plucked them free and tucked them into a folded scrap of parchment.

Hazel caught him doing it. “Sentimental much?”
He smiled softly. “It’s for Crow. He’ll probably want to study it. You know how he gets about wand materials.”

“Yeah,” she said with a smirk. “He’ll faint before dinner.”

Silvers shrugged. “He deserves something real. Something that reminds him what we’re actually learning for.”

Hazel tilted her head, surprised by the sincerity in his tone. “You’re a weird kid, Silvers. But… I like that about you.”

Goldilocks nuzzled his shoulder as if in agreement, her little horn shimmering faintly. Silvers chuckled and gave her one last pat.

“Don’t worry, Goldie,” he said quietly. “We’ll visit again soon.”

…

Later that night, in the dormitory, Crow was hunched over his desk, etching runes into a wand core diagram.

Silvers approached and placed the folded parchment beside him. “Got you something.”
Crow opened it, and froze. “Is this…?”

“Unicorn hair,” Silvers said with a grin. “A gift from Goldilocks. She’s healthy. Hazel and I helped clean her up.”

Crow stared at the glowing strands, wonder softening his features. “You… kept this for me?”

“Figured you’d want to see it up close.”

Crow smiled faintly. “You figured right.”

He turned the strands in the lamplight, the silver glow reflected in both their eyes. “You know,” Crow murmured, “Unicorn hair isn’t just rare, it’s pure magic. It can’t lie. Whatever it’s tied to, it’ll always seek truth.”

Silvers blinked, something in those words stirring uneasily in his chest. “Truth, huh?”

Crow nodded. “Yeah. Maybe it’ll help you find yours.”
Silvers looked at the hair again, the faint shimmer dancing like moonlight, and for a brief instant, his eyes glowed silver to match.

…

The dormitory was still. Most students were asleep; only the faint crackle from the fireplace and the rustle of parchment broke the silence.

Crow was still bent over the unicorn hair, sketching diagrams by candlelight, when Silvers returned from washing up.

“Hey,” Crow said, not looking up. “You left something on your bed.”

Silvers frowned. On his blanket sat a small, neatly wrapped package tied with deep violet ribbon. There was no name, no note, just his.

He picked it up carefully. “Did you see who left it?”

Crow shook his head. “No one came in. It just… appeared.”

A chill ran down Silvers’ spine. He hesitated, then began to untie the ribbon. Inside was a leather-bound scrapbook, old but lovingly kept. Its cover bore a faint scent of lilac and candle wax.

When he opened it, the breath caught in his throat.

Photographs, some magical, some still. They filled the pages. A laughing baby with two-toned hair and mismatched eyes: one silver-red, one yellow. The same as his.

In one photo, a curvaceous woman held the child close, her skin pale as moonlight, her smile sharp and radiant. Her eyes were bright, glowing amethyst and looked straight at the camera.

Crow leaned in, his expression shifting from curiosity to stunned silence. “Bloody hell…”

Silvers turned another page, hands trembling. More images,him crawling, playing with floating ribbons of purple flame, a little note in elegant handwriting: My little light shines brightest under the moon.

The handwriting curled like smoke across the page. Familiar. Too familiar.

Crow’s voice dropped to a whisper. “That’s her… isn’t it?”

Silvers nodded slowly, throat tight. “The Amethyst-eyed witch from that night!”

“The one that broke in to kiss you goodnight?”

He swallowed hard. “Now I think we know why, Crow. That's  my mother!”

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The candlelight flickered across the photograph, the witch’s eyes almost seemed to glow, watching them.
Crow finally exhaled. “Well… that explains the eyes.”

Silvers managed a shaky laugh, but his hands wouldn’t stop trembling. “It explains too much.”

He stared down at the photo again, and for just an instant, the faintest scent of lilac filled the room.
Outside, a wind swept past the tower, rattling the window latch. The scrapbook’s pages turned themselves to a final photograph, one that hadn’t been there before.

The same woman, staring straight into the camera. Written beneath in glimmering violet ink:

“Don’t be afraid, my little light. Mommy’s watching.”

Crow’s candle flickered out.

…

The usual morning chatter fills the Great Hall, clinking goblets, fluttering owls, and the echo of Peeves laughing somewhere near the rafters (probably because Hazel had just launched a muffin at him). But at the far end of the Slytherin table, three first-years huddle together in uncharacteristic silence.

Crow’s hand rests on the open scrapbook, his eyes flicking between each glossy, time-worn photo. Hazel leans in, her expression softer than usual, though her leg bounces under the table. Silvers stares down at the image of a woman with amethyst eyes, cradling a baby with familiar dual-colored hair.

The baby’s little fist is clutching her finger. The woman is smiling at him like he’s the only thing that matters in the world.

Harry Potter is halfway through his coffee when the sight catches his eye. He sees Silvers’ pale, stunned face, the open scrapbook, and the picture that peeks out toward him.

The mug trembles in his hand.

He sets it down and rises quietly from the staff table. Every step toward them feels heavier. The closer he gets, the clearer that picture becomes those eyes, that smile, that mark of light and storm.

When he reaches them, all three kids look up, startled. Hazel straightens, as if expecting to get scolded. Crow clutches the book protectively.

Silvers simply looks lost.

Harry’s gaze lands on the photograph again, and the color drains from his face completely. His mouth opens once, then closes.

“…Where did you get that?” his voice is barely above a whisper.

Silvers swallows. “It…it was on my bed this morning. We thought it was just some old scrapbook until we saw…” He gestures helplessly to the image. “Her.”

Harry’s eyes stay locked on the witch’s face for several long, silent seconds. Then, finally, he exhales and says quietly, “I… I knew her. A long time ago.”

The trio exchange glances.

“She is … complicated,” Harry continues, forcing himself to look away. “Brilliant. Dangerous, in ways few understood. But seeing this…” He presses a hand to the photo, his expression unreadable. “... a lot of things make sense now. About you, Silvers.”

Silvers blinks. “You mean… my eyes?” His hands glow with raw magic. “My magic?”

Harry nods slowly, still pale. “Yes. And the way the world seems to bend around you. You have her presence… and something else besides.” He looks as if he’s about to say more, but then stops himself. “You should hold onto that book. It’s… part of who you are.”

He straightens, his expression carefully neutral again. “Finish your breakfast. And Silvers…”

Silvers looks up at him.

Harry’s green eyes soften, full of something between worry and guilt. “Whatever that dream was… whatever you saw in it… don’t let it define you. You’re not them.”

Then, without another word, the Head Auror-turned-headmaster turns and walks away, leaving the trio in heavy silence.

Crow finally breathes out. “Bloody hell,” he mutters. “You think he actually knew your mum?”

Hazel elbows him lightly. “Knew her? He looked like he’d seen a ghost.”

Silvers stares down at the page again. The woman’s amethyst eyes seem to glow in the morning light. His own eyes turn that same color as well.

“…Maybe he did.”

Let’s talk anything from movies, what shows you’re watching, your deepest fears, honestly anything. I’m a huge horror fan and am always looking for new recommendations, especially in the found footage genre. I guess some hobbies of mine are watching really long YouTube video essays, reading, playing video games a bit, I consider myself a coffee snob, and I’m pretty good at keeping a convo going as long as you’re interested! 

I promise I have a lot more interesting things to me I just always blank when it comes to laying it all out in a post. 

Something short lived like a quick conversation is cool but if it develops into something more long term or even romantic I’m definitely open to that as well :) send me photo of yourself and I’ll send one back!  

I much prefer you be close to my age and no younger than me, especially if you’re interested in something more than a friend. Being in the US is preferred and even better if you’re in my area!

On our first date he usually insist and after that we're on 50/50,  sometimes his treat, sometimes its on me.. But lately, i notice wherever we're eating outside, he has no initiative to tell me that its his treat or maybe we're on split bill. like this weekend, when we meet on friday night i insisted to have our coffee since he always pick me up so for me i need to treat him for simply thanks him for always pick me and drop me on my house. so fast forward sunday evening we decided to go to thrift shop, after that he says he wants to eat, so i ask him if he has on his mind on what were going to eat. he said oww i know some place, and after we're on the cafe shop, i waited for him turn to say, thats its my treat. but instead he says go to the line, i'm behind you. and were order to the counter after that i wait for him to insist or say were split on the bill. but after our order he has no words to say but wait for me to pay. Im a bit off because i felt like, why? why its always on me? fast forward, tommorow morning, he used to drop me on my office but we have change plan not to go tru and go to his place, but i suggest that we take our breakfast and coffee since its raining and we don't have raincot, we stopped at fast food chain. and again he wait for me to go to counter and tell me whats his order.

* *Proctor's Lease*
* *Troy BID Levy redux?*
* *Collar City Cranksgiving*
* *TCSD*
* *Troy Library Admin*



# Tuesday, November 4

**Election Day**\-Polls are open from 6am-9pm today, with City Council, County Legislature, County Executive, and State Supreme Court up for grabs. Local elections, where your choice can be most impactful, are often decided by just a handful of votes, so make sure yours counts today.

*To check your registration status and find your polling location, click* [*here*](https://voterlookup.elections.ny.gov/)*.*

*To see your sample ballot, click* [*here*](https://www.rensco.com/692/Sample-Ballots).



# Wednesday, November 5

**Troy Library Admin Committee**\-[The Troy Library](https://www.thetroylibrary.org/) Admin Committee is meeting at 5:30 pm, presumably at the main branch location (100 2nd St).

Neither an agenda for the upcoming meeting nor draft minutes from the October meeting have been made available, but last month’s agenda, when charter revision, a code of conduct, and bylaws of the organization were on the menu, gives gentle notes of administrative intrigue. 

*This meeting will be a hybrid. To access the Zoom link, as well as the agenda when published, click* [*here*](https://www.thetroylibrary.org/library-board/)*.*

**Troy City School District**\- [TCSD](https://www.troycsd.org/) School Board will hold its monthly meeting at 6 pm, followed at 7 pm by a community meeting to discuss the feasibility of the proposed merger with the [Wyantskill Union Free School District](https://www.wynantskillufsd.org/).

*Both meetings take place at Troy Middle School (1976 Burdett Ave.) recordings of previous meetings can be accessed* [*here*](https://www.troycsd.org/board-of-education/meeting-schedule/)*.*



# Thursday, November 6

**BID Board**\- The executive committee of the [Downtown Troy BID](https://www.downtowntroyny.org/) Board of Directors will hold their monthly meeting at 9 am at BID offices, 102 3rd St.

At the October meeting of the board, it was decided to approach Council with a modified proposal to increase its tax levy from 5% to 10% of city tax on qualified properties within the district, rather than the original 15%.  
  
During the October meeting, it was decided that the board would hold a community forum to present discuss the modified proposal, though to date no date has been made public. The board wishes to present to City Council at one of the November meetings, likely the Finance Committee on Nov 20. (Stay tuned?)

**City Council**\-Troy City Council will hold a special Finance Committee (6pm) and Regular Meeting (7 pm.) While the big ticket item on the agenda is likely to be the draft lease for Mayor Mantello’s proposed City Hall move to the site of the former Proctor’s Theater, other noteworthy legislation modifying the zoning code to, among other things, restrict the placement of marijuana dispensaries, is also on the menu.

***Notably absent from the agenda is the presentation of the Q3 Financials***, which were due to Council on October 31 per the City Charter but have yet to be delivered, and would presumably help Councilmembers better assess the City’s ability to take on such an expensive project.

*These meetings will begin at 6 pm in Council Chambers at City Hall (433 River St, 5th Floor) and can be livestreamed* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/@TroyCityCouncil)*. To see the agendas, including the proposed lease for City Hall, click* [*here*](https://www.troyny.gov/AgendaCenter/City-Council-11)*.*



# Friday, November 7

**LDC**\-[The Troy Local Development Corporation](https://www.troyny.gov/306/Troy-Local-Development-Corporation) is having a special meeting at 9 am in the City Hall Planning Conference Room, 433 River St, 5th Floor.  
No agenda has been published (when it is, it will be available [here](https://www.troyny.gov/AgendaCenter/Troy-Local-Development-Corporation-7)), but obviously this meeting concerns the Proctor’s lease.

Looking to get a routine down so I don’t feel like I’m dying and wasting my off days. I try to work my 3 12’s in a row but sometimes it doesn’t work out that way. 

Disclaimer: I understand what may work for others may not work for me and this will ultimately be a trial and error! 

I work 7p-7:30a and I live about an hour one way from the hospital. I have to leave my house around 5:15pm to make it there on time (and leave enough time to swing by to pick up coffee!) After leaving, I get home around 8:30ish in the morning. 

I am 10 weeks pregnant with baby #4. Two of my kiddos are in school all day (husband takes/picks them up when I work) and I have one kiddo who is home with me starting around 11am until hubby gets home at 5pm. 

Lately, I’ve had help from my grandmother who watches my kiddo once she’s home from preK but I don’t really want to have to rely on her as she isn’t in the greatest health and my daughter can be a lot sometimes. 

Normally I sleep a regular night the night before (around 7-9hrs) and I’ll wake up around 6am. Then before my shift, I’ll nap from 10am-4pm. 
After my shift when I come home, I’ll shower and go straight to bed. I’ll sleep from 9am-4pm. Doing this though, I find that after my 3 shifts, I’m dead for the next 1-2 days and for all my days off, I’m completely drained and unmotivated to do anything around my house. 

I’ll take any and all advice from night shifters, especially those who have done it pregnant and with littles! ",1,1762235226.0,nursing,1,1.0,False

1onzkqf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onzkqf,Private room - Manhattan,"Hi, there!

This is an excellent opportunity to experience the privacy of a studio at a price comparable to a room in a great location.

I am a professional who works from home when I am in the city and then travels for a few months each year. I am also busy with my work and personal life, and I tend to keep to myself.

The apartment is clean and tidy, with everything you would need in the kitchen if you like to make your own meals (toaster, microwave, Air Fryer, Ninja blender, and food processor, among other appliances). I pay a cleaning service for the kitchen and bathroom every other week, which is included in the rent. The room has space for your clothes, a desk, a TV, and a small fridge you can use. The unit features a bunk bed with two twin beds.

The apartment is conveniently located near CVS, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, a laundry facility, and other shops. Additionally, it is located one block away from Riverbank Park. There are several transportation options (1, A, B, C, and D trains, as well as the M4 and M5 buses). It is an easy commute to Columbia University and CUNY.

I want to share my home with someone respectful, responsible, and laid-back. This is most definitely a non-drama space. You must be a non-smoker (the apartment is in a non-smoking building). I will ask you to bring references and provide $20 for a background check. Rent is $1600 plus electricity. The internet is included in the rent price. Negotiation is $3200 (First month and deposit)

I’m a 37-year-old guy from California looking to meet some new friends. I’ve had to distance myself from my old friend group due to their immaturity and issues with alcohol, and it’s left a bit of a gap in my social life. I’d really like to find people I can talk with, get to know, and maybe eventually meet up with, whether that’s just chilling and doing nothing, watching movies, or grabbing a coffee or going to the theater.

I deal with some health problems, mainly trouble eating and swallowing (dysphagia). It’s been tough, and it definitely causes me some anxiety at times, especially when I’m around people or trying to do normal social things. I’m working on it though and trying not to let it define my life.

As for hobbies, I love hiking and I’m working on getting back into doing overnighters. I enjoy watching old movies from the 60s through the 90s, recently started gardening, and I’ve also been learning to cook. I love reading spy novels too since they’re my favorite way to relax.

I’m married and don’t mind meeting either men or women. I’m just hoping to connect with some folks who are laid-back, kind, and enjoy good conversation or quiet company.

If any of that sounds like your vibe, feel free to message me. I’d really like to make some new friends.

1onziet,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtmengineering/comments/1onziet/how_to_gtm_engineer_my_sales_pipeline_struggling/,How to GTM Engineer my sales pipeline? Struggling with traditional outbound tactics in new role.,"Hey everyone. I am struggling. Badly. My main question is at the end after the context.  
I started a new role as a member of the first SDR team at a tech/professional services firm. So this is services sales. I was so excited to start, and the pay is amazing. My base is low 6-figures, highest base I've ever had. This firm has never gotten new logos through outbound, purely through referrals and relationships. So we are learning. We are prospecting into enterprises. There was no playbook before, no pipeline.

I just crossed the 3 month line 2 weeks ago, but since then, I've felt so unmotivated. I feel anxious, I wake up dreading work, and on remote WFH days I find myself not being able to work because I don't know where to start. I leave my phone at the house, and go to a coffee shop after my cold calling to focus, but can't seem to do anything meaningful towards revenue-generation.

Reason being, I can't seem to get a successful outbound function down. Nobody on this founding outbound team has gotten an opportunity from cold outreach. Granted, we only actually got tooling (sequencer, dialer, and lead enrichment) set up about 60 days ago We've only gotten opportunities through sales reps from our partner channels, which are good for our pipeline, but it feels like fluff since nothing came from outbound. Also, our pipeline is dependent on a third party, so its not truly ours and things are dependent on a middle man.

The team I was hired with is not good at working together, and while I tried to motivate everyone and make the culture work hard play-hard, no one wants to contribute to campaign creation, or outbound system creation. Everyone is negative or a ball of anxiety and it's kind of rubbed off on me. It's pretty draining to have a team that doesn't take initiative when this is kind of an entrepreneurial role. There's now more pressure from leadership as time is going on.

I've decided I just need to focus on myself and my own success for now, and control what I can. Once I get results I can try again to build campaigns and systems/processes as a team.

I want to turn things around. I know I can. I know this will be successful and a good learning period for me on how to build an outbound motion from scratch.

**I'm thinking of prospecting into SMBs, Startups, or Mid Market, because for how fast leadership wants results, I don't think we'll get that from Enterprise. I am thinking of taking GTM engineering workflows and doing that in my outbound to personalize at scale to SMBs and Startups for my pipeline. Anyone have any tips on where to start?** **I have ZoomInfo, Apollo, and SalesNav as tools.**",2,1762234950.0,gtmengineering,0,1.0,False

I went to do it again. Everything reset fine it seemed, our old network disappeared and the new default network from the side of the modem appeared.

Typed in the default Comcast business login info “cusadmin” for the username and “highspeed” for the password but it says the credentials are incorrect and won’t let me login. It gives me 10 tries. I tried the old password that didn’t work either and then when I was low on attempts I even factory reset it for a second time and it still won’t accept the default login credentials.

Any ideas? Planning on trying to get a new modem tomorrow but we are a coffee shop and open early and having no internet to start the day is not ideal.

1onzhc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CountyWeak3522/comments/1onzhc1/the_bookstore_window/,The Bookstore Window,"Every Saturday at 4, Claire sat at the window of her little bookstore and read whatever novel had called to her that week. Same time, same chair, and the tea lukewarm by the second chapter.

 

And every Saturday, a man walked by on the sidewalk outside—coffee in hand, blue hoodie pulled tightly over his head, peeking through the glass. Whenever entered. Never waved. Just walked by.

 

Until a rainy afternoon, when he stopped.

 

He stood in the downpour, watching her through the glass.

 

Claire found her gaze pulled from pages and smiled—a small smile, but a definite one.

 

He stepped inside, drenched, holding a bouquet of bookmarks. Book. Marks. Home-make. All quotes were from books she had been reading over the last couple of months.

 

“I didn’t know how to start a conversation”, he said, voice shaking. “But it seemed like you deserved a proper introduction.”

 

Claire blinked, quickening her heart rate. “You’ve been reading the same books?”

 

He nodded. “And falling for the girl in the window.”

 

Claire rose, reaching for the bouquet, and chuckled.

 

“Well,” she said, “you finally turned the page.”

I eventually realized that it would be better to turn it into a web app because excel sheets were limited and difficult to work with. A friend of mine suggested that I post this web app since it would be helpful to him. So here is the link to the web app  
[https://personal-planning-tool.vercel.app/](https://personal-planning-tool.vercel.app/)

Its pretty simple -

1. Upload your syllabus (AND course calendar), the app makes an API call to convert it into a calendar of your assignments and readings.
2. You can click on the assignments/courses and add relevant context to them.
3. Simply press ""Get started"" to help you begin the assignment (or ask any questions you have). This burns the ‘barrier’/brain fog that you face when trying to start your schoolwork.

Very simple, but helpful. Check it out, and let me know if there are any issues you face.

1onzfai,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1onzfai/i_cant_get_over_my_ex_after_2_years/,I can’t get over my ex after 2 years.,"I met my ex about two and a half years ago, and we had a short but extremely intense relationship.
He was the man who ignited the most desire in me in my life.
We dated for about six months.
But he used a lot of drugs, went to parties, and hid things from me that made me lose trust in him.
I got pregnant at the end, and I ended up having an abortion because it wasn’t the right time. He wanted to keep it, but I made the decision not to.
He respected my decision, supported me through the process, and stayed by my side.

Later, I ended things because of his drug use. But he chased me for months — sending flowers, gifts, messages — and I just ignored him because I was angry at him for what he did.

A few months later, I started dating my current boyfriend, and during that time, I went through a deep depression with psychosomatic symptoms in my sexual organs.
After a lot of therapy and medication, the symptoms disappeared, and so did the depression.

But I realized that in my current relationship, I was looking for someone to provide safety and care — and I found that.
However, I don’t feel like the sexual woman in me is awake; I feel like the child in me is present.

I started noticing this because my current boyfriend complains that we don’t have sex as often as he’d like and that I don’t seem to enjoy it.

And that made me realize that every time I have sex, I’m lamenting that it’s not with my ex.
It’s not him I’m being intimate with.

My current relationship has shown me that many things can be fixed.
We reached stability after giving each other multiple chances. It’s a good relationship for both of us now.

With my ex, I gave him ONE chance, and I left.
And it was with him that I LOVED and STILL LOVE to have sex, the one who ignites a fire in me that no one else does.
With my current partner, my body doesn’t ignite. I’ve never felt that spark — I was always thinking of my ex.

Over the last year, I’ve considered writing to my ex multiple times, but I always thought: “Why? It would end up the same as before — he’ll go back to drugs and parties.”

Then my friend told me he’s getting married to someone she knows after about six months of dating. Apparently, he’s changed completely because she doesn’t party or do drugs, and he’s been a “prince charming” to her.

My world collapsed.
I decided to reach out to him, hoping to meet for coffee and tell him everything I feel, apologize for my past actions, and see if he still has feelings for me.
He declined my invitation.

I always suspected he wouldn’t be faithful, which is part of why I didn’t continue the relationship.
But he has been faithful to her.

This is killing me.
I haven’t been able to get over him for months, despite being in therapy. I feel like I keep talking about the same thing without making progress.

I feel guilty crying over my ex for so long while being with someone else. Like… what? I don’t understand what’s happening in my heart.

I confess I secretly hope his marriage fails and that he comes back to me.
But I know I can’t place my happiness in that, because it may never happen.

I feel like no one will ever make me feel as desirable, sexy, and attracted to someone as my ex did.
His personality challenged me, and I loved his boldness. I just wish I had given him more chances and maybe polished things a little more.

With my current relationship, I miss the fire, the touch, the daring — but no one will ever be my ex.

God… how do I move on?

1onzbg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/salesdevelopment/comments/1onzbg6/struggling_after_90_days_in_founding_sdr_role/,Struggling after 90 days in founding SDR role.,"Hey everyone. I am struggling. Badly.  
I started a new role as a member of the first SDR team at a tech/professional services firm. So this is services sales. I was so excited to start, and the pay is amazing. My base is low 6-figures, highest base I've ever had. This firm has never gotten new logos through outbound, purely through referrals and relationships. So we are learning. We are prospecting into enterprises. There was no playbook before, no pipeline.

I just crossed the 3 month line 2 weeks ago, but since then, I've felt so unmotivated. I feel anxious, I wake up dreading work, and on remote WFH days I find myself not being able to work because I don't know where to start. I leave my phone at the house, and go to a coffee shop after my cold calling to focus, but can't seem to do anything meaningful towards revenue-generation.

Reason being, I can't seem to get a successful outbound function down. Nobody on this founding outbound team has gotten an opportunity from cold outreach. Granted, we only actually got tooling (sequencer, dialer, and lead enrichment) set up about 60 days ago We've only gotten opportunities through sales reps from our partner channels, which are good for our pipeline, but it feels like fluff since nothing came from outbound. Also, our pipeline is dependent on a third party, so its not truly ours and things are dependent on a middle man.

The team I was hired with is not good at working together, and while I tried to motivate everyone and make the culture work hard play-hard, no one wants to contribute to campaign creation, or outbound system creation. Everyone is really negative and dejected or a ball of anxiety and it's kind of rubbed off on me. It's pretty draining to have a team that doesn't take initiative when this is kind of an entrepreneurial role. There's now more pressure from leadership as time is going on.

I've decided I just need to focus on myself and my own success for now, and control what I can. Once I get results I can try again to build campaigns and systems/processes as a team.

I want to turn things around. I know I can. **Anyone ever been on a similar boat where your first 90 days at a company were terrible? How did you turn it around?** I feel like I have to start from scratch and chalk up these last 60-90 days as learning. I know this will be successful and a good learning period for me on how to build an outbound motion from scratch. I'm thinking of prospecting into SMBs or Mid Market, because for how fast leadership wants results, I don't think we'll get that from Enterprise. All of our previous use-cases and clients have been enterprises, though. Maybe I have to treat this more as a GTM Engineer role to really scale SMB outbound?

And how do I actually end this when I just want out? (32F, 36M)","I (32F) dated my ex (36M) for almost three years. I broke up with him this past February because I had growing concerns about our future — mostly around his lack of direction, responsibility, and communication.

He lives in his family’s old farmhouse — literally in the unfinished basement, on a futon with a sleeping bag, with spiderwebs all over his door, bugs, and even a snake that was loose for months. I honestly don’t know how he sleeps down there. His stuff smells like a mildew basement. He moved back there after dropping out of college and never left.

He’s supposed to “inherit” and take over the family farm, but there’s no clear plan or timeline. The farm makes no profit, and his dad can’t retire because he has no savings. The whole situation feels stuck in time, and I realized our life goals are completely different.

His friends love to party, drink, and smoke weed constantly. He’s bragged about drunk driving for fun in his twenties and doing “stunts” with friends. Even now, he drives recklessly and pushes boundaries — he’s scared me in the car before. He’s been arrested several times (including a DUI), has totaled multiple vehicles, and sometimes still drinks and drives or smokes weed despite having a job that randomly drug tests. He hasn’t been in legal trouble since 2016, but he still uses a radar detector and does stupid things.

He dropped out of college with $125k in private student loans at 23 and still owes about $50k. When I try to talk about the future — money, housing, or responsibility — he avoids it, gets defensive, or says “I don’t know.” I want a partner who is stable, thoughtful, and building a future with me. He just wants to stay comfortable. I’ve realized that if we ever lived together, I’d be leading every decision while he resisted the whole time.

After I broke up with him, I reached out again in April to apologize for how I ended things. Since then, we’ve been in this weird gray area — texting most nights, seeing each other every 2–3 weeks, and being intimate again. He said “trust needs to be rebuilt” and that he’d need time and consistency before even considering a relationship again. Everything feels vague and aimless.

A couple weeks ago, I told him I wasn’t feeling like my needs were being met and that I didn’t know where we stood. He replied with a long message saying he felt the same — that it “wasn’t working for either of us,” and that there was “no foundation to rebuild on.” To me, that sounded like a breakup.

But two days later, he texted saying he wanted to see me and talk about things. We went to dinner, I got emotional and teary-eyed, but he didn’t acknowledge it. He just said he’d been “busy with family and the farm.” Then he helped me set up a new TV, stayed the night, we slept together, and the next morning he kissed me goodbye like everything was fine.

Now he’s back to texting me most nights again, though not every day. He didn’t text me on Halloween but sent a photo of his costume the next day. I honestly have no idea what’s going on.

Here’s the thing: I really, truly want the whole thing to be over. I feel like he’s not going to let go easily. He lives an hour away on a remote farm, and I’m scared to have to tell him in person. He’s shown a temper before, is impulsive and reckless, and I feel like he’d try to manipulate me back in.

Part of me wants to fade him out or just send a message and block him, but I know that’s not the “right” thing to do. I just don’t know how else to end it. I feel like he wants me around for comfort, but he’s not giving me what I need emotionally or otherwise.

Last time I broke up with him in February, I pulled away for months and then finally did it over text and blocked him. My friends and parents said that was cold, but honestly, I was scared. I’ve seen his temper — once he was shaking and banging things when he got angry over a joke, and another time he drove my car dangerously after an argument. He later said, “You don’t want to make me mad.”

After the breakup, he sent flowers to my work. My friend said I should thank him, so I unblocked him to do that. He begged to see me, saying he’d “move mountains” if I’d just give him another chance. I packed his stuff into a storage locker for him to pick up, and he was furious about it. We didn’t talk for two months, until my mom said I should apologize because “he’s a good guy.” So I reached out, and he agreed to meet for coffee — but he was cold and angry, saying I was disrespectful and cruel for ending a 3-year relationship over text and putting his things in storage. I felt like a monster.

Now we’re back in this weird half-relationship where we text most nights — usually alternating who initiates. I’ve been trying to slow it down, but I feel guilty, like I’m hurting his feelings. I don’t even know if he’s that into me or just keeping me around out of habit.

His family and friends all say he’s the best person they know — sweet, loyal, dependable, smart, and handy. His sisters adore him. His aunt even left her estate to him. Everyone talks about how wonderful he is, and I just end up feeling confused and guilty for not seeing what they see.

I don’t even know if we’re broken up or not. I just know I’m drained. I want to move on, but he keeps reappearing.

Did he break up with me in that message? Are we still in limbo? And how do I actually end this for good when I feel scared and guilty but so, so done?",4,1762233739.0,AmIOverreacting,18,1.0,False

I am a 24y.o. black trans woman, been out since 19. I pass, and I'm very lucky and thankful for it, and it means I have a lot of social capital to participate in this society. I've also been in the coffee industry for about the same time, 5 years.

I know realistically I have had to build myself up from nothing after leaving my parents with no skills or qualifications, and having a lifestyle I am very proud of is a testament to how strong I have been, but goddamn is it exhausting.

I noticed it got worse after I got a lymphatic drainage massage but that same week I also had an ear infection and also after  my neck ultrasound the doctor was being too rough on my neck that it hurt after. 

My ear pain subsided after antibiotics, the ENT also cleaned my ear but the thing is now my ear feels sensitive I don’t know how to describe the pain because it’s not painful it feels sensitive? Sometimes it feels hot sometimes it feels cold I can’t tell the difference. I can’t pin point where it starts in my neck as well but it feels connected to my muscles for example I feel like certain movements make it worse. 

The weird thing is when I am moving, walking, eating, doing any activity the pain is gone. It only happens when I’m sitting.

I read a lot about it and they say usually if a thyroid nodule is big enough it presses on the nerves but mine is small so I’m not so sure. Also I do have acid reflux issues, that’s how I incidentally found my nodule because I felt discomfort due to GERD so could that cause the discomfort on one side to ear? I tried cutting down coffee and acidic food my acid reflex still there. Also when I went to the ENT she said I have a retracted eardrum so don’t know if that would cause this kind of pain. 

I’m asking because I know it’s not the kind of pain that is debilitating, I can go by my day fine but it’s the kind of pain that’s weird, like why does my ear feels sensitive and hot? It’s also making me want to move, eat and do more activities because actually I don’t feel it when I do which is the strange thing. Just want to see if anyone has a similar experience.

*by Anonymous*

# Part I – The Day the Clock Stood Still

The United States of America had finally agreed on something.  
They all hated Daylight Saving Time.

From farmers to programmers, from yoga moms to truckers, the nation’s single point of unity was that nobody wanted to change the clocks anymore. It was stupid. It was confusing. It made everyone tired for a week and late for church on Sunday.

So naturally, Washington, D.C. had been arguing about it for twenty-seven years.

**The Independent**

President Alex Harper hadn’t even wanted the job. They’d been a mayor once, then a governor, then an internet meme. They wore rolled-up sleeves, rode the Metro, and used phrases like “common sense.”  
When both major parties split their votes in 2028, Harper squeaked into the White House with 31% of the popular vote and a prayer.

The pundits called it a *miracle.*  
Congress called it *Tuesday.*

**The Campaign Promise**

Harper’s first act as President wasn’t a war, a tax cut, or a scandal. It was a simple bill:  
**“The Sunshine Standardization Act.”**  
One time zone. No more clock changes. A bipartisan no-brainer.

The bill had one paragraph and a footnote clarifying that “Arizona already doesn’t count.”

Within forty-eight hours, both parties had turned it into a holy war.  
Republicans claimed it was “federal overreach into state time.”  
Democrats insisted it “disproportionately impacted marginalized night-shift workers.”  
Cable news called it *The Great Clock Crisis.*

**The Meeting**

By July, nothing had passed. Not the clock bill, not the budget, not even the National Catfish Awareness Resolution.

So Harper called them in — the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader — for what aides later described as “an unscheduled bipartisan consultation” and what the Secret Service described as “an incoming Category 5 event.”

The Oval Office doors closed.

For fifteen minutes, the three of them argued about procedure. Then they argued about messaging. Then they argued about who’d started arguing.

Finally, Harper snapped.

>

The Speaker opened their mouth. The Senator raised a finger. Harper slammed a hand on the desk.

>

Silence filled the room, thick as syrup. The ticking of the presidential clock was deafening.

Then, inevitably, the Senator said, “Well, Mr. President, perhaps if you’d reached across the aisle earlier—”

>

**The Executive Order**

Three days later, an executive order appeared:  
**“By authority vested in me, the United States shall maintain its current time until Congress acts otherwise.”**

Half the states obeyed. The other half didn’t.  
Airlines imploded. TV schedules became existential riddles.  
Somewhere in Kansas, two towns ten miles apart were an hour and a lifetime away from each other.

Harper stood in the Rose Garden as the chaos unfolded and whispered,

>

**The Moral**

In the next election, both major parties promised to “restore the clock.”  
Harper retired to teach civics at a community college, where they were known for one saying:

>

# Part II – Late Night with Grant Fuller

*(Cue theme music. Crowd cheers. The band fades out as Grant Fuller walks out, waving, holding a coffee mug that says “MAKE AMERICA NAP AGAIN.”)*

**GRANT FULLER:**  
Good evening, folks! Great to be here — assuming we’re *actually* here at the same time. I flew in from New York this morning, but depending on which state you’re in, it’s either 11 PM, midnight, or… Tuesday.

Yeah — apparently half the country ignored the president’s executive order to freeze Daylight Saving Time, and the other half said, “Sure, why not, we’re already late for everything else.”

You ever see a nation so divided we can’t even agree what time it is?  
In California it’s 8 PM.  
In Texas it’s 9 PM.  
And in Congress it’s still 1956.

So if you missed it — President Alex Harper got fed up and told both political parties to “shut up and grow up.”  
Which, let’s be honest, is the most presidential thing said in the Oval Office in thirty years.

Then Harper signs an executive order to stop changing the clocks. Half the governors followed it, half didn’t, and now Amtrak’s running on Schrödinger Time.  
No one knows if the train’s on time until you open the door.

Airlines are in chaos. Delta just announced a new “Approximate Arrival Program.”  
You’ll land *sometime tomorrow*, probably in the same time zone you left, unless Congress moves the goalposts.

And good luck scheduling meetings!  
My producer just told me we have *three* guests booked for tonight’s show — the same guest, in three different time zones.  
Right now, our guest from Chicago is technically from *the future.*

Meanwhile, the Republicans are saying Harper’s power grab is “a federal assault on the space-time continuum,” and the Democrats are calling it “temporal inequality.”  
Folks — it’s a clock. It doesn’t care if you’re red, blue, or just late for brunch.

Of course, the President tried to hold a unity summit this afternoon.  
But it failed because one party showed up an hour early, and the other an hour late.  
They passed each other in the hallway and blamed *the media.*

You know what’s wild? The only Americans actually on the same schedule right now are the cows.  
Farmers never changed their clocks anyway — they just milked the cows when they were awake.  
Which means, congratulations, America: the cows are officially smarter than Congress.

I miss the old days when the country argued about stuff like taxes, or war, or aliens. Now we’re at each other’s throats over *the position of the sun.*

Maybe Harper’s right — maybe time isn’t broken. Maybe *we are.*

Anyway, coming up next — our guest tonight is an airline pilot who accidentally crossed three time zones without leaving Missouri. Stick around — if you can figure out what time it is.

*(Music swells, applause. Cut to commercial.)*

# Part III – The News Cycle

**CNN — 6:00 a.m. EST**  
“Good morning, America — if it *is* morning where you are. President Harper’s executive order halting Daylight Saving Time continues to cause widespread confusion. Experts estimate the nation has now split into six functional time zones and one existential crisis.”

**FOX NEWS — 6:02 a.m. CST**  
“Sources tell us the President’s move is a direct attack on freedom itself. Next, we’ll ask: Is ending Daylight Saving Time part of a secret globalist plot to control the sunrise?”

**MSNBC — 6:05 a.m. PST**  
“Progressives are calling the crisis ‘Clock Gate,’ demanding daylight reparations for those disproportionately affected by temporal disorientation.”

**Talk Radio Host:**  
“Folks, it’s simple: first they take our guns, then our time. Next thing you know, they’ll come for our microwaves because they have clocks!”

**Press Briefing:**  
REPORTER: “So is noon still noon?”  
PRESS SECRETARY: “That depends on your lived experience.”

**Financial Report:**  
“The stock market closed early today — or late — depending on how you define ‘today.’ Wall Street analysts are describing the Dow as ‘chronologically unstable.’ Bitcoin, however, remains timeless.”

**Citizen Voice:**  
A waitress resets the wall clock for the third time that day.  
“I don’t care who’s president,” she says. “Just tell me when breakfast ends.”

# Part IV – International Reaction

**London, UK** – “We will coordinate with Washington once we know when Washington is.”  
*(Big Ben chimes awkwardly 13 times.)*

**Paris, France** – “They spent decades exporting democracy, and now they can’t even import punctuality.”

**Beijing, China** – “Our clocks remain synchronized — as does our productivity.”

**Moscow, Russia** – “We always knew the West would lose track of time. It began with history.”

**Tokyo, Japan** – “Flights to the U.S. now operate under a system called *‘approximate arrival.’* You land when you land.”

**Australia** – “Until they figure out what time it is, we’re not answering calls from Washington. It’s like ringing your drunk uncle at Christmas.”

**Vatican City** – “Perhaps God gave them all the same sun so they would learn to share it.”

**United Nations** – Two U.S. delegates stand to speak at once: one claiming it’s 10 a.m., the other 8 a.m. The motion to restore global time passes — pending congressional approval, which never comes.

# Part V – The Final Address

*(Oval Office. Dimly lit. The clock behind the President is frozen at 12:00.)*

**PRESIDENT HARPER:**  
“My fellow Americans…

I come before you tonight — or afternoon, depending — to speak not about time, but about what we’ve done with it.

When I ran for this office, I said we could agree on something simple.  
That maybe, just maybe, the clock didn’t have to control us.  
I was wrong. It turns out, we don’t need a clock to be divided. We can do that all by ourselves.”

“Over the past year, I’ve watched governors argue with mayors, pilots argue with control towers, and news anchors argue with their own countdown timers.  
Somewhere in there, we forgot the point.

Time was never supposed to be political. It was supposed to be a shared heartbeat — a rhythm that said, ‘We’re here together.’  
But we stopped listening. We let pride set the schedule, and resentment keep the minutes.”

“History won’t remember this as the year America lost its sense of time.  
It’ll remember it as the year we proved how far we’d go to avoid admitting someone else was right.”

“When I signed that executive order, I thought I was buying us peace.  
What I bought was chaos — because peace, like time, isn’t something you declare. It’s something you make… together.

So tonight, I’m signing one more order: the end of my presidency.  
I’m stepping down. Not in defeat, but in hope — that whoever follows might finally remind us what hour it is. Not on the clock… but in our hearts.”

“They say time heals all wounds.  
I think it’s the other way around.  
When we start to heal, that’s when time starts moving again.”

*(Harper sets the microphone on the desk, turns, and walks away. The clock behind them remains still. The rain continues outside. Fade to black.)*

(We Know, We Nailed It.)","Dashing in all that he does, the English actor is stealing scenes — and hearts — and solidifying his standing as one of Hollywood's most magnetic stars

[Jonathan Bailey](https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-8742153) knows how to bring the heat. Literally. After diving into the frigid ocean off a beach south of London for this cover shoot (his idea), he sits down in a cable knit sweater and requests a glass of Bordeaux (this writer joins him as well), and within minutes everyone in the room looks flushed.

  
It’s also quickly obvious why the English actor, 37, brimming with charm, wit and almost unfairly handsome looks, has become one of the most irresistible stars in Hollywood. And yet he’s still getting used to all the fuss.

Asked when he first realized his fame was growing, Bailey recalls a moment in 2020 shortly after the steamy Netflix series [*Bridgerton*](https://people.com/tv/bridgerton-cast-everything-to-know/) catapulted him into the spotlight. “I had the radio set for my alarm, and one morning it went off with, ‘Here’s the news at 7. But just before we go, can we talk about Jonathan Bailey?’ ” the actor says with an incredulous laugh. “I was like, ‘Where is my journal? Is this real?’ It was wild.”

He’s going to need a bigger journal. In the past five years Bailey has captured hearts as Lord Anthony on *Bridgerton* and earned an Emmy nomination for his role as a closeted congressional staffer in the Showtime series [*Fellow Travelers*](https://people.com/why-jonathan-bailey-says-doing-fellow-travelers-was-no-brainer-after-bridgerton-exclusive-8411771). Then, of course, there’s his 2024 big-screen debut as Prince Fiyero in the movie [musical megahit *Wicked*,](https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-shares-wicked-behind-the-scenes-photos-videos-ariana-grande-8751562) followed by this summer’s blockbuster [*Jurassic World: Rebirth*](https://people.com/scarlett-johansson-jonathan-bailey-wedgies-jurassic-world-stunt-exclusive-11765302).

The actor has been grateful to work alongside “brilliant” talent like [Matt Bomer](https://people.com/tag/matt-bomer/), [Ariana Grande](https://people.com/tag/ariana-grande/), [Cynthia Erivo](https://people.com/tag/cynthia-erivo/) and [Scarlett Johansson](https://people.com/tag/scarlett-johansson/). Based on [photos of him with his costars](https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-bite-scarlett-johansson-neck-photo-jurassic-world-rebirth-11797563) (always hugging, [sometimes kissing](https://people.com/colin-jost-is-okay-with-scarlett-johansson-kissing-jonathan-bailey-11770491)), the feeling appears to be very mutual.

Bailey, who was raised in rural Oxfordshire with three older sisters by his mom, Carole, and dad, Stuart, knew he wanted to be an actor at age 5 after seeing a performance of *Oliver!* with his grandmother.

**I FEEL AWKWARD QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME. I FEEL LIKE THAT STATE IS LIFELONG FOR ME**

At 7, he was performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company in London and has continued to master his craft both on stage and screen ever since.

Ahead of the finale, [*Wicked: For Good*](https://people.com/people-wicked-for-good-special-issue-exclusive-11838269), hitting theaters Nov. 21, “Jonno,” as his close friends call him, is enjoying the last few weeks of calm before the fan-frenzied storm begins again. “You get to a point where you look back and you go, ‘Wow,’ but you never for a second think that’s where you’re headed,” he says. “You know, to be able to do things that you dream of.”

**So what did you think when you heard you were being given the Sexiest Man Alive crown?** 

It’s a huge honor. Obviously I’m incredibly flattered. And it’s completely absurd. \[*Laughs*\] It’s been a secret, so I’m quite excited for some friends and family to find out.

**You really haven’t told anyone?** 

I told my dog Benson \[who joined him at the shoot\]. But no, I haven’t. How do you spell . . . NDA? 

**Who do you think will give you the most grief?**

I think a lot of my friends will. They’ll be furious that I haven’t told them. And then they’ll just squeal with delight. They’ve seen me grow up. Behind the mask of being identified as a sexy man are other truths that they know and they’ve witnessed. They know the secrets.

**What were you like as a kid?** 

I was really enthusiastic, probably quite annoying. Hard to calm down. I don’t think I ever thought of myself as sexy as I grew up. 

**When did you start being comfortable in your skin?** 

At various moments in my life I’ve been like, “I’ve got this,” which is sometimes met by a deep spike of fear and self-doubt. When I was really young, I was very confident about who I was, and maybe I lost that as I grew up. We’re all sort of trying to get back to the origin, aren’t we? But I was swimming in the sea about an hour ago with a good gang, and I felt all right in my skin. 

**And now you’re the Sexiest Man Alive. Is there anything you’ve failed at but learned from?** 

I didn’t finish open university, where you study from home. I signed up for about nine different courses, not realizing if you didn’t finish them, you get expelled. So I didn’t finish my volcanoes and tsunami course, or my Leonardo da Vinci course. I did finish my music course, but just at that point, I got expelled. Hopefully that’ll be something I can go back to.

**Do you really think you will?** 

I do, yeah. I want to know . . . what happens with volcanoes. \[*Laughs*\]

**Is there a hobby you wish you had?** 

I wish I could play the cello. I started having lessons, and it was pretty harsh. And languages — I couldn’t grasp languages. You know, I can speak \[in French\] about my house. That I get a bus to school and that I’ve got a cat. And I do actually \[say that\] . . . after a glass of red. If I’m in France. 

**Take us through a typical day off.** 

I get up, go for a walk, have coffee. Go see friends or listen to loads of music, always got headphones near me. And then maybe watch a film or maybe go to the theater.

**What does a perfect date night entail?** 

Oh God, it totally depends. I love a walk, I do love dinner, theater, films. It depends what number date. You know, if it’s like date 100, then like Legos, although we Brits say it singular “Lego,” and pizza. Some of my best dates have been Lego dates.

**What traits are most important when it comes to being in a relationship?** 

Communication — and being clear. Transparency is absolutely utmost, utmost, utmost. And really supporting, really cheerleading and watching someone thrive, should be a real turn-on. 

**Any deal-breakers?** 

The opposite of those. Bad communication, lack of transparency. Doesn’t like Lego. Actually, I’ll only be with somebody who can speak three languages. Yeah, and they’ve got seven degrees and a doctorate. Otherwise they’re just not good enough. \[*Laughs*\]

**When’s the last time you were moved to tears?** 

Well, I did see *Wicked: For Good* yesterday. But beyond watching my own work, in a good way I get moved to tears by family quite a lot. Like my niece was pupil of the week, and I was just so proud of her. And she’s the eldest of the next gen of Baileys. And that made me well up. In fact, all my sisters, when they send pictures of their kids — I do find family does make me really emotional.

**Do you see yourself as a dad someday?** 

Yeah. If the planets align, for sure. I feel like in the world that we live in now, everyone’s going to need a bit of guidance. Although I’d be terrible at getting them through university. And they would not be able to speak another language. But maybe they will, and that’s how I’ll learn. 

**What’s your worst habit?** 

I’m an overthinker. My brain goes off sometimes like the Fourth of July.

**Do you ever read comments on Instagram?** 

I try not to. I think sometimes you get really sucked in. But it’s much rarer \[now\].

**Before you became the Internet’s boyfriend?** 

I don’t know about that. There’s so many of them, right? I think maybe back in the day, it was like free speech, say what you like. But I might read it once a month. I might dive in.

**Who was your first celeb crush?** 

I’d say Prince Eric \[from *The Little Mermaid*\], but also Trini in *Power Rangers*. I remember accidentally throwing two garden tools over the fence trying to be her. 

**What advice would you give to your 15-year-old self?** 

Dude, you’re in for a ride. You’re not going to believe where you’re going to end up. It’s all going to be fine. It’ll be bumpy, but you’ll meet some amazing people. And trust your instincts because they’ve got your back.

**How would you describe your life now?** 

I feel incredibly lucky. Life is a ride for everyone no matter who you are, where you come from. It’s just making sure that when you’re in the ride, you’re looking left and right and making sure everyone’s all right. And give them a high-five along the way if they need it.

I used to think I was immune to that kind of thing. Do the work, clock out, move on. But after New Hope… I’ve started asking the kind of questions that keep you up at night, I don’t like the answers I’m finding.



I’m back at Bureau Headquarters now, and things have already changed. The outcome of the East–West Alliance summit wasn’t what anyone hoped for. The diplomats smiled for the cameras, shook hands, and went home to prepare for another round of sanctions and skirmishes.



There’s been unofficial talk that Earth might pull out of the Peace Talks after the siege of New Hope. Too many losses, too much pride at stake. You can feel it in the corridors: the hum of a system fraying at the edges. Everyone is pretending it’s business as usual. Everyone except me.

So it came as a surprise to me, and to most of the Bureau when we became the first casualty of the political skirmishes.

Ras’Al, the old spider himself, had steered the Bureau through a dozen wars and twice as many scandals. But a man like that doesn’t retire, he’s recalled, quietly, through a tangle of backroom deadlocks and “procedural tugs” at the Compact Congress. All of it orchestrated just far enough out of sight of the Earth Allied and East Bloc delegates to look accidental.

The West, with their unsavory colonial projects and their insectoid representatives, didn’t bother with subtlety. They hid behind the language of bureaucracy. Calling their swarms *separate*, *distinct*, *diverse* mandates. The rest of us knew what it really meant: the hive was spreading.

Ras’Al’s departure wasn’t supposed to be a tragedy. We threw him a farewell party that night—one last toast to the Bureau’s greatest tactician. The lounge was thick with smoke and nostalgia, old detectives swapping lies about cases that never made it to record. Even the brass loosened their collars.

I was mid-conversation with Chief Yarrow about the East–West embargo when the door behind us *slammed open*. The music faltered.

In the doorway stood an insectoid, eyes like shards of glass reflecting the entire room. 

“Kazen,” the insectoid said. “Envoy of the Western Mandate. Effective immediately, I assume command of Bureau operations under new amendments pushed through Compact Congress.”

Glasses halfway raised, conversations cut short mid-word. Ras’Al blinked once, the faintest smile forming under his heavy brow.

“That’s a bold,” he said. “Considering my contract doesn’t expire until tomorrow.”

The insectoid didn’t move. In one smooth motion, a shimmering limb brushed Yarrow aside as though swatting dust. The glass shattered across the floor.

Kazen advanced until he stood face to face with Ras’Al. “The Compact grows tired of inefficiency,” he said. “Your regime has rotted from within. I intend to remove the excess, *by any means necessary.*”

Ras’Al straightened, his smile gone now, the air between them vibrating with the insectoid’s internal hum.

“Careful, Kazen,” he said. “Things may have changed in your favour, but hive drones don’t last that long.”

No one spoke after that, besides Yarrow, hoping to cut down on the tension with some jokes.

Yarrow, grey-eared Furrian, stepped forward with his drink sloshing over the rim. “How about you sit down, Envoy,” he said, his voice low and amused. “We’ll toast to your new post.” He clapped a broad hand on Kazen’s shoulder.

“Gentlemen,” he said, “let’s not turn Ras’Al’s send-off into another tribunal.” He lifted his glass in a shaky salute, sloshing amber liquor onto the floor. The gesture drew a few uneasy laughs, but mostly embarrassed silence.

Ras’Al exhaled. “Sit down, Yarrow.”

“Agreed,” Kazen added, his mandibles twitching. “Furrians have never handled Earth’s stronger spirits well.”

That earned a few groans from the crowd. I leaned forward. “Easy, Envoy. You might not remember, but the last time someone mocked a Furrian at a Bureau function, we wound up with half the station under quarantine. The Gooning Disease, wasn’t it?”

Ras’Al chuckled. “That’s right. Kazen was working at the Center for Disease Control then. He saved us a lot of paperwork.”

Yarrow flushed, his grey ears folding back. “I was patient zero for the cure, if I recall,” he muttered, to another ripple of laughter. For a brief moment, the tension cracked. Even Kazen’s plated jaw clicked in what might’ve been amusement.

Then he ruined it. “Speaking of diseases,” Kazen said, tone flattening, “I’ve already made a list of who I’ll be *removing* from the Bureau.”

Ras’Al’s hand rose, calm but firm. “Not tonight, Kazen. We’ll discuss your ambitions privately. You and I both know how to read the Compact’s shifting winds.”

Kazen’s left mandible twitches once, an involuntary tic.

For the first time his voice drops below the hum.

“…Fine. But it’s Ka-zhen, old wolf. You’ve mis-said it since the Gooning crisis. Even the human gets it right.”

He recovers in the same breath, crest snapping upright, but the room has already seen the crack.

Kazen paused, then inclined his head. “Of course, Director.” He lowered his crest crown, the gesture oddly formal, and turned toward the exit. “Detective Dibble,” he added as he passed, his tone dry, “consider updating your wardrobe. The Bureau’s image matters now.”

I gave him a nod. “I’ll add it to my list.”

The door closed behind him, sealing the echo of his wings. Yarrow pressed a fresh drink into my hand. “To new management,” he said, forcing a grin.

“Yeah,” I muttered, clinking his glass. “Let’s hope it lasts longer than the old one.”

Morning hit like a concussion.

I woke slumped over Yarrow’s shoulder, the world a blur of throbbing pain and chemical aftertaste. We were half-buried in the empty glasses, confidential case files adorned with glittering confetti. The party had raged on after Kazen’s exit, a futile, drunken rebellion against the inevitable. It had ended without dignity.

My head pounded in perfect, sickening sync with the relentless hum of the fluorescent lights. I dragged myself upright, peeling a sticky ""Happy Retirement!"" banner off my sleeve, and went in search of the one god left worth praying to: coffee. 

That’s when I heard it, not the shuffling of hungover detectives, but boots. Dozens of them. Marching down the corridor, a sound like a clockwork army advancing on our doors.

A voice, sharp and stripped of all humanity, cut through the haze. “Open up! Bureau inspection!”

The doors burst inward with a scream of tortured metal. A squad of officers flooded in, their armor a uniform, chilling grey, some planetary outfit. Around the office, bleary-eyed detectives jerked awake at their terminals, blinking in a confusion that curdled into disbelief.

“For the love of—” Yarrow groaned, clutching his head as if to keep it from splitting open. “Can someone please tell the brass we’re closed for auditing?”

The grey-clad squad parted without a word, and she strode through.

She was a Scyline, tall and plated in battle armour. Her footsteps halted at my desk.

“Detective Dibble,” she said. “You will escort me to the Director.”

I blinked, the caffeine-deprived fog refusing to lift. “Ma’am,” I managed, “I don’t take orders from anyone outside Bureau command.”

“Then consider this Bureau command.” A younger officer spoke from behind her, but his voice was just an echo. Her authority was the only real thing in the room.

I sighed, the motion making my skull pulse. I gestured vaguely toward Ras’Al’s door. “He’s in there. Help yourself.”

She brushed past me, the scent she left behind was something faintly floral, a deceptive sweetness. She marched to the Director’s office and slammed the door open without knocking.

“Great,” I muttered, getting up for a coffee at the corner of the room. 

“Another violation for the list. Why does every planet upset with an investigation, send their thugs, ignore half the regulations, and expect us to smile about it.” I took a bitter sip. “At least the coffee’s still terrible.”

When I turned, the room had frozen again. People had gotten up, and approached the Scyline. Every face was pale, every eye locked on the open doorway. The marching guards stood at rigid attention, their earlier arrogance replaced by a new, watchful tension.

“What now?” I asked, my voice too loud in the hush. “Did they find Ras’Al’s secret brandy stash?”

No one answered. 

I pushed through the crowd, the bad coffee churning in my gut. I reached the doorway and stopped cold.

There they were. Ras’Al and Kazen, sprawled across the ornate carpet in a grotesque parody of their final confrontation. Blood, one grey another purple, pooled beneath them, mingling into a single pool. Between them, the Director’s crest crown lay cracked clean in two.

And standing over them, her back to us, was the Scyline. She was perfectly still.

Yarrow stumbled up beside me, his hangover forgotten, his ears flat against his skull. “By the stars…” he breathed.

The Scyline turned. 

“I am Queen Reba,” she announced. The title wasn’t a boast; it was a fact. “With the authority of the ratified amendments to the Bureau, I now assume the position of Head of this Bureau. You will address me as Reba.”

She had just declared herself monarch of the murder scene. We all took an involuntary step back.

It was Yarrow who found his voice first, a low, distrustful growl. “Scylines… they’re supposed to be non-aligned. How did they get a post so high?”

“A convenient fiction,” someone else muttered from the crowd. “They’re websingers. Deception is their native tongue.”

My own mind raced, connecting the warnings. Known for deception. And here she was, the first on the scene, installing herself as absolute ruler before the bodies were even cold. The stench of a setup was overwhelming.

But the bodies were real. The blood was real.

“The murders,” I said, my voice cutting through the murmurs. I stepped forward, ignoring the warning buzz from one of her royal guards. I met her impossible gaze. “Head Reba. A double homicide of the former and incoming leadership takes precedence over any… procedural announcement.”

Reba’s head tilted a fraction, a predator considering an insect. “You are mistaken, Detective Dibble,” she said, her tone flat and final. “The preservation of this institution is now the only priority. My priority. Everything else… is excess.”

Her eyes lingered on me for a moment too long, and I knew, with a cold certainty, that I had just found my name on Kazen’s list—and on hers.

The thought formed, cold and certain in my mind: 

I am going to hate this job.

1onynu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1onynu4/work_crush/,Work Crush?,"I recently discovered that my husband has been getting very close with one of his subordinates. I found Teams messages showing that they had been talking everyday, basically non-stop for a few weeks. Nothing overtly sexual/romantic, but obvious flirty banter. Lots of inside jokes, sharing music, playful teasing, and compliments like “you’re funny”, “you’re witty”, and “you did a perfect job on that assignment”. Literally all day long. I confronted him, and he claims they are just friends and it didn’t mean anything to him. He also said “that’s just how she is” but that he understood why id be upset. He does not act this way with anyone else, and I really think he’s developed feelings but just won’t admit it. I confronted him and asked him to put up boundaries by only talking to her when necessary and only about work related things. I have noticed an improvement, but they still have been talking a little bit everyday, and today I found messages showing that they talked for 45 minutes straight about non-work related stuff. When I asked him about it, he said he thought the topics were benign and I wouldn’t care. I was admittedly furious because we’ve had many conversations about this and I’ve repeatedly expressed my concerns and the boundaries I’d like him to set. How could you think I’d be okay with it? 

He has claimed over and over again that it wasn’t flirting or romantic to him, but I just cant understand how two people could talk that consistently and frequently without feeling something. Couple of other things:

1. In all of their messages, never once did either of them bring up their significant others. I’m not asking him to talk about me the whole time, but if you’re “just friends” wouldn’t spouses naturally come up at least once? He’s also never mentioned their friendship to me.

2. The day I found the messages, I also realized he and her were working together out of an office that isn’t his home office. He usually works there once a week, but that day she came too and he had to escort her in the building (she didn’t have a badge). She also got him coffee. He did not mention any of this to me. I found it in their messages. He said he didn’t think it was worth mentioning and that she worked there because it was closer to child care that day. 

3. I have no evidence that they’ve ever communicated via text or otherwise outside of Teams, but one Friday night she sent him a message at about 8 PM and then deleted it. I don’t know what it said, but thought it was odd. Who messages their manager late on a Friday and then deletes it? They work a standard 9-5 corporate job that requires no after hours support.

4. She has acknowledged a change in his behavior several times since I discovered this. She sent a couple messages about being concerned he was “kidnapped” or replaced with a robot. After that she called him and said she wanted him to know she “talked to her husband about being concerned she was getting too chummy with her boss and she respects him”. 

Is this something or am I being paranoid and jealous? Does he have a crush? As I mentioned, he is her supervisor and I’m having a hard time accepting that they can continue working together and respecting boundaries.

1onymbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1onymbu/shanghai_ritz_carlton_pudong_vs_st_regis_on_the/,Shanghai: Ritz Carlton Pudong vs. St. Regis on the Bund,"I recently took a quick trip to Shanghai and stayed at both the RC Pudong and StR on the Bund and thought a comparison might be interesting for folks who, like me, are sort of (self-)handcuffed to Bonvoy hotels when traveling. Note that when I stayed, the nightly STARS rates at both hotels (booked through Sarah's team) were essentially the same at \~US$350.

  
**St Regis on the Bund**

* The hotel has a really lavish ""Chinese Art Deco"" style design (if there is such a thing) that feels very luxurious and we loved it. There is more marble around than I thought existed on earth. The room was fantastic: large, super comfy, had tech that worked well (e.g., switchable smart glass between the bathroom and room), great linens, bath products, big wardrobe area with lots of storage, etc.
* It was our first time in Shanghai and we had limited time so the location right on the Bund was great for a 10-minute walk over to Yu Gardens, 15 minutes to Nanjing street, and other ""must sees"". Speaking of the location, the grand river view room to which we were upgraded had a nice view of the river and skyline.
* The breakfast buffet is probably the best we've enjoyed anywhere in terms of quantity, variety, and quality (and we live in Asia where breakfast buffets are a big deal). I prefer not-a-buffet for breakfast (like the StR Hong Kong) but even I was pretty stoked with the one here. We used the US$100 STARS credit on lunch at Celestial Court for some fancy Cantonese food and it was good if not a little under-flavored for my (admittedly Neanderthal-like) palate.
* The service was well-intentioned and friendly but could use polishing. A couple examples: over email before our stay the concierge team gave me completely incorrect information about something at the hotel and in the same emails addressed me by some random incorrect name. We arranged a late check-out at 4pm at check-in but surprise, the room key card didn't work after 12pm on the day we were leaving. It seems not standard for the bell staff to automatically bring bags to the room at check-in; one needs to request it. So overall, I'm being very picky; there was certainly nothing major and I'm not whining, but the service could be a little better. 

**Ritz Carlton Shanghai, Pudong**

* The style at the RC is a early-2000's bling. (shiny things, mirrors, wood accents, etc.) which is fine, but to me, dated. My complaint is that not only are things dated but they are getting long in the tooth: visible scuffs and scrapes here and there, chipped glass in a couple places, cracks in some wood. The condition of the tables, chairs, floor, etc. at the breakfast venue was approaching ""old Sheraton"". I think a refresh is about due.
* We were upgraded to a corner room which had amazing views (more on that in a sec) but was surprisingly small. There was fairly limited hanging space for clothes and storage space for bags, etc.. The bathroom was well-sized and fine (frankly almost as big as the rest of the room) but continuing the overall theme: a little dated.
* The views from our room (and the breakfast restaurant, and the roof top bar) were phenomenal. Like, wow. From our room we had a direct view of the Oriental Pearl Tower to the left and the Shanghai Tower to the right. A lot of time was spent sitting at the windows looking out at the daytime and nighttime views.
* It's located in the same building as the IFC Mall, one of these ubiquitous ""international luxury brand fancy malls"" you find all over the world. The Metro is also just there which makes getting around the city pretty easy.
* The breakfast buffet was fair, not great, in terms of expanse and quality. The space also actually feels a little cramped when full of people so there was a lot of ""excuse me"", ""pardon me"", ""sorry"", etc. when walking around getting food. Speaking of being full, the wait staff struggled to keep up with clearing used plates, bringing coffee, etc.
* We used the US$100 STARS credit at the Flair rooftop bar and unsurprisingly it doesn't stretch far but we had a couple drinks and nibbles and just really enjoyed the views. It is very much a photo hot spot so is filled with a funny crowd of Westerners in shorts and socks and sandals gawking and taking pictures, hi-so fancy locals really dressed to the nines looking to impress each other, and a few people like us who are somewhere in between.
* Lastly, it has to be noted that the service (apart from at breakfast) was notably excellent. From the front door staff, to bell staff, to front desk folks, to housekeeping, etc. everyone was efficient, quick, friendly, helpful, and competent; really great.

So, we had a nice stay at both hotels and enjoyed them for different reasons. Interestingly, we had the same experience in Hong Kong: my wife and I both really thought the views at the RC were cool to experience (that harbor view in HK truly is awesome) but liked the St. Regis more. Without hesitation (unless the price is out of reach) we would stay at both St. Regises (Regii?) on future trips to Shanghai and to Hong Kong. Speaking of my wife, thanks to her for enabling my sometimes-annoying habit of bouncing around to different hotels when we travel because I like experiencing different ones and well, of course I also appreciate ""deals"" and getting multiple STARS, Virtuoso, etc. credits for multiple stays.

On that note, thanks to Sarah and her team for their help with this and several other trips (past and upcoming). I'm grateful and fortunate to be an ever-so-slightly overweight traveler but not at all FAT. I honestly hesitated to contact them a year ago, having seen the incredibly high-value travel they plan for some folks. My own insecurities made me think I might be a little neglected or treated differently because my travel budgets are significantly less than many of their other clients. Well, I'm super happy I did contact them and engaged them because in no way have they ever made me feel like a second-class citizen. Quite the contrary, they are happy to help me find deals and stretch my travel budget. And they give me no s\*\*\* or attitude when I re-book reservations when I see a rate has dropped $12 a night... :-) They have been great partners in my and my family's travels and I look forward to working with them moving forward.",2,1762231969.0,FATTravel,0,1.0,False
1onylh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onylh6/having_now_finished_every_quest_so_far_the_quests/,Having now finished every quest so far... the quests need work.,"I just finished the last quest that's available for now, for me that was >!killing a leaper.!<

All up, finishing all >!60 something!<quests while also helping 4 of my mates do the same took me around 45hrs (yes I have no lifed this game, I took time off work, yes I am aware how sad that is).

I'm a 3000hr Tarkov player who has had jack of that game and have been desperate for years for something in the extraction genre to do something other than 'Tarkov In Space' or 'Mobile Game Tarkov', and Arc Raiders is the first game that I really think could actually compete because it's totally doing its own thing, it's way more approachable and has way better quality of life, and has a completely unique but completely fleshed out vibe all of its own. We are finally seeing this genre let go of its roots and start to really experiment.

I know this game is trying to appeal to a less hardcore user base and I think that is great - but the reason no one has taken down the king that is EfT is that there's no game I am aware of that comes anywhere close to managing the sheer depth it has in its progression and questing system. I think Arc Raiders could do it.

Franky, every quest from about level 20 onwards felt more like an errand. They weren't particularly difficult, but many of them were annoying - e.g. the many, many quests that wind up requiring you to >!bring in wires,!<but don't mention it at the outset. That's not good quest design, it's just 'Ha, we got you, go back to your stash and then come back'.

I'd estimate that from the mid game onwards, about 70% of the quests basically boil down to 'go to this place and interact with this thing' or 'bring me back this unique quest item, also if you have more than one person doing this quest in your squad you'll have to come back again'. It's boring! It's uninspired, and this game is better than that.

Why can't we have a totally separate quest line for sweats like me who want a real challenge? Why can't we have more interesting main quests like Tarkov Shooter style quests where you have to take out targets from a certain range or with a certain weapon? The trapping system in this game is great, why not have a quest about it? Why not have quests about avoiding arc/stealth gameplay? Why not quests that require co-operation from other squads? There are so many systems this game has that could make for iconic memorable questlines and instead we just have shit like 'go and find me some books please'.

To put it another way - why did I spend 80% of my time in the late stage of this round of quests just running back and forth across maps hitting buttons? The quests are not something they have just tacked onto the game - they're how the story unfolds and without spoiling anything, completing the last few quests reveals something pretty huge about the plot. I'd like to see a lot more out of the questing system in the future because god damn, the last 30 or so were boring as hell. >!Fixing a coffee pot !<at level 25 was stupid as hell.",1,1762231888.0,ArcRaiders,2,0.57,False
1onyk96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1onyk96/1989/,1989.,"I'm burning alive.  

Orange meets yellow; yellow meets my skin, prickling through every vein, every nerve ending, flames licking across my skull. Every organ is ablaze. 

Every part of me erupts. 

Ignited, I fight to think, to keep my thoughts from turning into nothing. 

Time passes. How long has passed?  

Eventually, the fog clears.   

I am no longer burning.  

I'm freezing.  

*“Marie?”*  

*“Marie, it’s me. Can you open your eyes?”*  

I remember his voice, but he isn't here.    

Deafening silence rushes through my ears as my fingers bend.   

Shapes dance behind my eyelids. Cold. This new body is cold.   

I have awoken inside a corpse with a heart that no longer pumps and beats and bleeds.   I twitch a finger. Then a hand. 

My toes curl.

Something sharp pricks at the roof of my mouth.  

Nicholas.   

His name parts my new lips, a sharp tingle scratching my throat.   

I open my eyes.  

…  

October 15th, 1989.  

Newborn parties were overrated.   

My legs dangled off the roof of the town hall, music blasting in my ears, while below me my party went on without me.   

All my friends were having the time of their lives.   

I was mourning my humanity with a pack of Sour Patch Kids and a coke propped on my knees. 

I sipped it slowly, my fingers wrapped around frosted aluminum.   

Some half-vampire I was.  

“Ah, yes! The vampire princess’s favorite snack. Sour Patch Kids.”   

It didn't take long for the Golden boy himself, and the most recent kid to develop his big-boy teeth, to join me.  

Nicholas Invinia was the boy I was destined to marry once reborn, the one I was meant to spend the rest of eternity with. 

I didn't ask for his company, but he followed me anyway, after stalking me all the way through my parents' farewell speech. That's what suitors did. 

Especially ones my father favored. 

Dropping down beside me, his head found my shoulder. 

I caught the sharp scent of whiskey. 

Nicholas smelled like a wino.   

Male vampires, especially fledglings, barely faced any consequences when showing clear signs of indulging in human delicacies. 

Meanwhile, I was slapped for drinking soda. 

Nick leaned over and snatched a handful of candy. “Tired of your party?”  

“Nope.”   

I tried not to look at him, watching the city stretched out before us, towering skyscrapers grazing the sky and the  glittering rush-hour. 

Our newborn party, what my parents called a “coming of age celebration,” was really just a countdown to letting go of all of this. Warmth in my hands. 

Gummies in my lap. 

Breath in my lungs.   

I thought I wanted to be a vampire. 

Now, so close to rebirth, I clutched my humanity a little tighter, like a blanket. 

Nick was right. I wanted to escape, from the party, from the pressure-cooker smiles of adults, from the word-vomit that had become increasingly hard to swallow. 

I wanted to escape judgmental stares behind wine glasses.  

The younger fledglings were easier; they were still human, after all. 

But the older ones, Aunt Emilia and Uncle Wyatt, wasted no time.  

What was supposed to be a celebration for me and Nicholas had been overrun by the coven, their razor-sharp smiles scaring away my oblivious human friends.   

Aunt Emilia was radiant in a revealing red dress, blonde curls piled atop her head.   

Almost two thousand years old, she looked thirty-five. 

“Baby girl, haven’t your teeth come in yet? How does she expect you to be reborn if you can’t even manage the basics?”  

She was right. Newborn vampires do need animal blood to complete the change.   

If a fledgling doesn’t take in small amounts of human blood during adolescence, there’s a chance their body might reject the transformation.   

Mom was strict about it. Every meal came with a small glass of animal blood. 

I couldn’t stand it. It was too thick, too heavy, like licking the inside of a shower drain.   According to my aunt, that meant my “development was in jeopardy.”  

Half-vampires were strange. We were born human and capable of becoming eternal.   

In our coven, every child faced a choice at eighteen: die and be reborn a vampire or leave and cling to humanity. 

The children in my coven don't get to choose their humanity. 

With my parents being devoted to old vampire traditions, they preferred to stick to being pro-hunting humans. 

While other covens had evolved, choosing coexistence over slaughter.   

From a young age, I was taught it was us against them.   

Survival versus surrender.   

Instinct versus restraint.   

We were the hunters and they were the prey. So of course, I was destined to become one. If I didn’t, I’d be cast out. 

For me, puberty arrived as a red stain on my jeans and a brand-new set of baby fangs.  

Nicholas’s real fangs had come in early. So, he’d spent half of the night being prodded and poked and praised by my relatives. Not that I was jealous.   

And I definitely wasn’t. 

Risking a glance at his looming shadow next to me, I was secretly seething. 

Nicholas didn’t look like a vampire.   

He looked like River Phoenix.   

There was far too much color in his cheeks.   

His fashion sense defied coven standards, wearing a leather jacket and acid-wash jeans, paired with socks and sandals.  

He whipped off his glasses. “Not in the mood to party?”  

I avoided his eyes. “Go away.”  

Leaning back, Nicholas made himself comfortable.  “Not until you tell me what’s wrong.”  

My mouth moved before I could stop it; it happened so fast, like it had a will of its own, a reflex I couldn't stop. “I don’t want to be a vampire anymore.”  

Nicholas whistled. “Sounds like nerves, darlin’,” he said, mocking my aunt’s accent.  

I held his gaze. “Call me that again and I’ll throw you off the roof.”  

He made a show of eating my candy, leaning back on his elbows and flashing a dazzling grin each time he popped one into his mouth, tilting his head so the light hit his newly elongated teeth just right.   

Once upon a time, when we had both been proud members of the “No Fangs Club,” little Nicholas had stabbed at his stubborn baby teeth, loudly declaring, “Maybe I don’t want to be a vampire!”  

Which was a far cry from now.  

“So, what, are you just going to abandon the coven?” Nicholas turned to me, eyes piercing, just like the elders.   

I wasn’t surprised. 

Nicholas’s father was the leader of a rival coven who, like my parents, were traditionalists.  Nick had been drinking animal blood since he was twelve. 

No wonder his fangs came early. 

I opened my mouth to answer, but I was scared of what would come out.  

I chewed a piece of candy instead, which was growing sour in my mouth. 

I checked the pack, frustration burning through me.

They weren’t even the sour ones.   

Mom had told me my taste buds would start to change before my rebirth.   

Part of me thought she was joking. Then my stomach lurched suddenly, and the sweet taste turned to bile. Urgh. I spat it out.   

I tried another and spat that one out too.  

I didn’t realize I was shoving candy into my mouth and choking it back, tears stinging 
my eyes, until Nicholas’s fingers held mine. 

All I could think about was how warm he was and how much I would miss it.  

The blood under his skin, the sweat on his palms, the blooming blush in his cheeks. 

Nicholas jumped up and kicked off his sandals. “Dance with me.”
  
“What?” I said, my breath caught between a gasp and a laugh. “There’s no music.”  

“We don’t need music.”  

He pulled me to my feet, and I staggered, my head spinning. 

Nicholas took my hand like we were at a ball, twirling me into a dizzy waltz. 

I imagined we were. Glittering lights. An expanse of glass windows. Shadows dancing around us. My lungs burned; a scream clawed at my throat. 

I thought we were going to fall when he spun me again, but instead, I flew.  
My body seemed to remember steps I’d never learned. We were dancing. 

My clammy hands clung to his. Words burned on my tongue. 

Under the pale light of the full moon, Nicholas’s grin widened, and I caught the glint of his teeth. “What’s the first thing you're going to do as a vampire?”  

His words were like knives splitting my spine.   

I flinched, trying to pull away.   
The closer I was to him, the harder it was to make my decision. “I don’t want to talk about it.”   

He inclined his head, lips pricking. “I'm your fiancé.”   

“Not yet.”  

Nicholas laughed, and it was contagious. “So, you’re saying you don’t want to spend eternity with me?”  

He was stalling. I could tell.   

Nicholas Invinia couldn't go five minutes without talking about himself, and here he was, dancing with me under the moon, suspiciously close to midnight.   

I pulled him towards me, so close, his breath tickling cheeks. “Did my father ask you to come talk to me?”   

He responded with a knowing smirk. “What makes you think that?” 

Nicholas pulled me closer, and like magnets forced apart, we snapped back. 

We were push and pull, repelling and snapping together.   

I stumbled, nearly falling, but he caught me against his chest, fast, vivid, dizzying.   

His breath grazed my ear, lips brushing dangerously close to my neck. 

Sharp points tickled my throat, and I felt a rush of pleasure, of heat, creeping through me. It took every part of me, body, mind, and soul, to not give in to temptation. 

“My father told you to come to lecture me,” I said, “Right? You're making it obvious.”

Nicholas sighed, like I was the inconvenience.

“Okay, fine, busted,” he stepped back. 

His pace quickened into something sharper, almost a foxtrot. “Tell me. What is your fascination with staying human?”  

“A heartbeat,” I said, matching his steps again. 

This time, I led, spinning him around. 

“I hate the taste of blood.” I drew him closer, letting my lips hover at his throat. 

“I like school. I like my friends. I want to go to college, to travel the world, I want to—”   

I stopped myself, breathless but unwilling to let go. 

Lies tasted like vomit. Yet lies were the only thing keeping me anchored. 

School, college, growing old, none of it mattered. 

Of course I wanted to be a newborn; of course I wanted to marry Nicholas.  

“You know you can do all that as a vampire,” Nicholas said, taking control again. His eyes followed mine, vicious, dizzying, penetrating.   

The dance unraveled, falling apart, our steps uneven, clashing and coming together. “School, college, human friends, you know you can keep them.”   

He spun me across the rooftop, the wind tangling in my hair, until the motion stopped abruptly.   

His fingers loosened around mine, and I didn’t realize until I opened my eyes that the roof had vanished beneath our feet, pooling darkness carved into the stars. 

I froze, body arched, hair dangling, breath catching.  

So close to falling. 

A scream clawed at my throat. 

Was this his plan all along? 

To make me fall? 

Was that my father’s order?   

Death wouldn’t kill me. I fought against him, my nerve endings burning.

Death would turn me.   

I tried to maintain my nonchalance, aware of my sharp, heavy breaths, my dress weighing me down.  “This is cruel.”

Nick’s expression didn’t waver. “Tell me why you don’t want to be a vampire.”  

I laughed, choking on it. “So you can drop me, Nick?” 

Vulnerability bled through me, my humanity feeling like a disease. 

I was running on autopilot. 

The cry that tore from my throat was childish, too human. “Don’t let go.”  

“I won’t.” His face was steady, somehow trustworthy.  

I folded. Maybe it was the shame of hiding what I was from my parents. Maybe it was how Nick made me feel. “I’m scared,” I admitted. The words tasted like bile, thick and shameful. “I don’t want to reject it.”  

Nick’s brows furrowed. “Reject what?”  

“Pull me up,” I hissed, panic flooding through me. 

My body hung in nothingness, tethered to the void. I reached for his arm, slipping every time. “Now!”  

When he didn’t, I splintered apart, everything inside me breaking loose in a single shriek. “I don’t drink animal blood,” I gasped. I counted my breaths.   

One. Two. Three. Four.  

How many breaths would it take before I hit the ground?  

“Mom thinks she’s been feeding me animal blood since I was a… whoa.” I made the mistake of looking down. Fuck. 

My stomach lurched, and I snapped my gaze back to Nicholas’s piercing eyes.  

“I won’t drop you,” he said. “Go on.”  

“Since I was a kid,” I whispered, clutching him tighter. “I used to dump it. Pretend to drink it. Which means when I die, I’ll reject the change.”  

For a moment, he just stared, blank, trance-like.  

Then he blinked, laughed, and tightened his grip around my wrist, yanking me up. “You’re not serious.”  

Frustration boiled my blood. “I'm sorry, is my completely justifiable existential dread *funny* to you?”   

Nicholas smiled, pulling me from the dark until I was in his arms again, trembling, clinging to his neck. 

He was usually so composed, at least in front of my father, the perfect heir to the coven, my future husband. 

But right now, Nicholas was just an eighteen-year-old kid, a drunken fledgling. 

He opened his mouth, ready to spill whatever cliché shit bubbling in his head, then stumbled, and tripped over my foot.   

I slammed down on top of him, and he smiled up at me like all of this was a game.   

I tried to wrench my arms free, but his grip was iron, pinning me in place. Was he mocking me? Then he leaned in, a single strand of blond hair falling into his eyes. 

I could feel his breath, warm and human. His heartbeat pounded beneath me. He smelled of whiskey, sour candy, and sweat. “Hey, Marie?”  

The world seemed to stop. His eyes pinned me in place, and I was far too close to his lips. 

My breath hitched, heat climbing up my neck, heavy and consuming. Whatever filled me was intoxicating, feral, driving me closer until his breaths fluttered my cheek. 

I found my voice, but I didn't trust it. I didn't trust my body, and my hapless wandering hands.   “What?”  

He cupped my cheek and leaned in. 

I panicked.   

This was my first kiss as a human, with a heart that actually beat. 

But instead of meeting my lips, his breath grazed my ear. 

Nicholas rolled on top of me, his eyes daring me to resist.   

“That’s a fairy tale,” he whispered, lips cracking into a smirk.

“My aunt,” I countered, frozen by his smile. “She said…”  

“Your aunt?” Nick rolled his eyes. 

“She was just repeating an old wives’ tale from the dark ages. Traditional vampire families use them to scare fledglings into submission. My dad tried that trick on me and it didn’t work. Only fools fall for it.”  

Grinning, he flicked me on the nose. “Do you really think you can just reject the change? Are you an idiot, Marie?”  

I shoved him off me with a sharp kick. The heat of the moment drained away.

“*Fools*?”  

“Yes.” Nicholas jumped up, reached out for my hand and yanked me to my feet. 

He winked. You’re missing your party because your aunt scared you into paranoia. That's like, completely *normal* for a fledgling.”

“I don’t care.”  

“Well, what if I stayed with you?” He stepped closer, too close. 

I felt my breath falter, my heart fluttered.  “Your aunt won’t bother you if I’m there. We can dance, and drink pineapple wine coolers when our parents aren't watching.”   

He caught my arms and swung them playfully. “Just have fun. No vampire talk, no reminiscing, and definitely no crying.” His smile softened. “It’ll just be us.”  

“Do you want to be a vampire, Nicholas?” I blurted.  

His eyes darkened. “Why *wouldn’t* I?”   

Nicholas tugged me back to the party, and I stumbled after him.   

I could have let go. I could have pulled away and run, like I had planned to all night. But I didn’t. 

Somehow, I couldn’t let go of his hand.  

I ignored my aunt’s glare, my father’s looming figure washed in neon, and my mother’s tense smile. 

Instead, I downed colorful shots with my human friends and nearly died laughing at Nicholas’s dance moves. Time slipped by. 

When the crowd thinned and it was just the two of us, his arms draped over my shoulders. Midnight crept closer. 

Our coven circled the room like hungry sharks, eager for the turning.  

I turned away from them and pressed my face into Nick’s chest.   

Song after song drifted through the speakers, Whitney Houston, Simple Minds, Generation X.

I let myself disappear into him. The music faded into a soft hum. He never let go.  

“I’ll tell you something embarrassing about myself if you do the same,” Nick murmured into my hair.  

“Why?” I laughed.  

“I dunno. Maybe I’m stalling.”  

I didn’t even have to think about it. “That was my first almost-kiss,” I said. “The one with you.”  

“Oh,” his lips found the curve of my throat, teasing me.  “I was going to say I have a birthmark on my thigh that looks like Italy.”  

“You’re kidding.”  

He grinned, spinning me around to Take On Me. “I am 100% serious.”  

There was something achingly human about Nicholas, his scent, his smile, even his drinking problem. It was all him. 

I couldn’t imagine what he would be like as a mindless newborn, lost to bloodlust during his first vampiric year. 

I wouldn’t even be there to see it. 

Mom and Dad planned to lock me in the cellar until my own thirst passed.  

The jukebox clicked off, suddenly, and Nick froze, mid-dance.

Dad had already pulled the plug.  

Midnight. 

Nicholas, of course, didn't take it seriously. 

“Don’t you think it's kinda weird that vampirism is like, not a *choice*?” he said, loudly.   

Suddenly, all eyes were on us, and the whispering began. *“Ungrateful brats.”*

I had to bury my head in his chest to stop myself cracking up.

“Kids.” One of the elders spoke from across the room. He was blocking the door.

Subtle.

“It's almost time.”   

Nicholas’s smile faded. “If you’re planning to run and stay human, I won’t stop you.”   

His hands slipped from my waist.  

“I’ll make a scene, pretend I’m sick or something. I'm a pretty good actor.”   

I could sense his grin. “Then you slip out the back door, and you’re home free.”  

I risked a glance behind me. The back door near the buffet table was open, light spilling into the night. I could run, yet somehow I couldn’t let go of Nicholas. 

So close. Mom wasn't watching. Dad was talking to the elders. I made my decision knowing he would protect me if I ran. 

Instead of giving in to temptation, I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him closer. I didn’t speak. I didn’t need to. 

“Marie.” Nick’s eyes found mine. “Go.”   

“Promise me,” I blurted before I could stop myself. “The moment you wake up, you’ll come find me.”  

Nicholas tilted his head, a crooked smirk tugging at his lips. “When I'm a mindless newborn driven by blood?”  

“When we’re *both* mindless newborns driven by blood,” I corrected him.  

I wasn’t sure if I loved him as a vampire, not yet. Maybe not ever, even as my husband.

But this part of him, this Nicholas, I couldn’t let go. I let myself be human, just once more. I cupped his cheeks, drinking in his warmth, and kissed him. Slowly. 

Savoring him. 

He tasted of raspberries and nicotine, and by the time he was kissing me back, his hands had found my face, desperate, almost feral.   

Cold fingers clamped down on my shoulder, yanking me away. Mom.   

I opened my eyes to see Nicholas being pulled back by his family, still grinning, wiping my lipstick from his chin as his father scolded him. 

“Marie.” Mom’s eyes were narrow, catlike. Her confident smile was a lie; she was just as worried I might reject the change. Aunt Emilia had been filling her head with nonsense since I turned twelve.      

She marched me into the kitchen, poured two bags of animal blood into a cup, and forced me to drink it all. I gagged at the taste, the texture, the metallic tang.  

“All of it,” Mom ordered, leaning against the counter with her arms crossed. “Your aunt thinks you’re not eating enough.”  

“Fascinating,” I muttered, downing the last of the dregs.   

By the third gulp, the taste barely bothered me.  

I set the cup down and wiped my lips. Suddenly, I was back on the roof, dancing with Nicholas, his teeth grazing my neck, the world falling away. I was weightless.   

Dancing on clouds.   

I blinked the memory away. If being a vampire meant being with Nicholas, then so be it. “Can I go be reborn now, Mother?”  

Mom rolled her eyes, but she did pull me into an awkward hug, pulling away and cupping my face.  

Her smile was practiced but firm, and I appreciated that. 

“I’m proud of you, honey,” she said, her fingers combing gently through my ponytail. I liked to think she was savoring my humanity too, my beating heart, the warmth beneath my skin. 

“Taking this next step is scary, yes,” she continued, “but trust me, once a year has passed and your thirst settles, you’ll be a beautiful young woman, ready to lead.” 

Mom’s lips curved into a knowing smile.   “The Montgomery prince makes you happy,” she said. “Your heart’s racing, and you’re practically radiating hormones.”

“Mom,” I said, embarrassed. 

She took my hand and led me down the cement stairs to the basement. 

Candles flickered in the dark, their orange light dancing over two open coffins. 

Nicholas sat cross-legged on his own, his father kneeling before him.  

Cornelius Invinia looked exactly like what you would imagine a two-thousand-year-old vampire to be, tall and ghastly, like a Halloween costume brought to life. Bulging eyes. Skin white as bone. 

“No distractions,” the man’s voice was a hoarse rasp. He sounded like a corpse too. “Do you understand me, Nicholas?”

Nicholas rolled his eyes, ignoring his father’s lecture, until he noticed me.

His face broke into a grin. “Hey!” 

He raised his hand to wave, lips moving as if to beckon me over, maybe to say goodbye.  Butterflies erupted in my gut. 

Fluttering.  I took that moment to memorize him: the slight furrow in his brow, his bright eyes the color of coffee beans, that one single strand of hair dipping in his eyes. His scent. Candy. 

Stale alcohol.   

Nicholas was my first love, the first person who made me want to be a vampire. 

I started forward to join him, before his father’s skeletal fingers closed around his throat, and with a single movement and a sickening crack, snapped Nicholas’s neck. 

The boy went limp in his father’s arms, his head lolling, falling backwards.
 
I didn't mean to scream. It just came out, raw, ripping from my lips.

Tears burned my eyes, my throat choking up.

“Marie,” Mom murmured behind me, her hands already firm on my shoulders.   

Like she expected me to run.

“It’s okay,” she said softly. “Male fledglings prefer a real death over drinking poison like females. Nicholas is going to be okay.”

But I knew she was lying. 

It looked deliberate. Cornelius had seen his son feeling, showing emotion, love. Was he not allowed to smile? To be happy?  

My head spun as Mom guided me toward my coffin. Candlelight flickered around me, the world turning dizzy and dim. Was that what the look in his eyes had meant? 

*“Why wouldn’t I?”* Nicholas had said, darkness clouding his expression and curling his smile.  

Did he not want to be a vampire?

Just like that, the boy I knew, the boy I loved, was gone. 

Cornelius caught his son’s body as it crumpled, placed him in the coffin, and shut it.  “Maribelle,” he said with a nod and smile. “Happy birthday, and happy rebirth.”

My stomach twisted. Words clawed at my throat, words that would get me exiled from the coven if I spoke them. 

As if sensing feral words, Mom’s nails dug into the bare skin of my shoulder.   

I climbed into my coffin obediently, took the chalice she handed me, and gulped it down. 

Mom leaned forward when my vision feathered and the chalice slipped out of my fingers. 

“It's going to be okay,” she whispered as my vision feathered. ”You're thinking about rejecting the change, aren't you?”   

Mom's face seemed to freeze, like a glitch, like the world itself was *stopping*.

—  

“Yes,” I croaked, opening my eyes.  

I blinked.   

Mom was gone.   

I was staring up at cobwebs strung across the ceiling and hanging in the corners.  

“Mom?” I called into the emptiness.   

The room felt hollow. The silence was deafening.  I sat up. I was no longer in the basement. Instead, I was inside Mom' s country house. I recognized my mother’s childhood bedroom. Everything was clear.   

I placed my hand over my heart.   

Nothing.   

I breathed into my palms. Nothing.   

Climbing out of my coffin, I glimpsed dark red splashes across the carpet floor. 

The corpse of a deer lay nearby, crumpled and drained of its blood.   

My dress was spattered scarlet, my hands ingrained with my meals, both human and animal, trails running down my neck and chin. I found myself smiling. 

Animal corpses meant I had completed the change and my year of bloodthirst.   

Traces of my lost year lay in each mutilated animal laying rotting on the floor.   

My throat was scratchy, but I wasn't the type of hungry I'd feared. 

I thought vampirism would be painful. 

I thought it would be endless, merciless hunger until I gave in and slaughtered every beating heart in my vicinity. 

Vampirism wasn't mindless thirst. 

It was.. still. Peaceful. 

No beating heart, but I had maintained my mind. 

“Nick.” His name felt both fresh and ancient clinging to my new tongue.   

I threw open his coffin, but all that remained was his silky white bed and the suit he had been buried in.  

My attention turned to the door, barricaded by a bookcase. I cocked my head. Strange. 

Mom wouldn’t lock me in, especially after a year had already passed. 

Unless my thirst had made me a danger to humans. 

The window was open, curtains whipping in the breeze. 

I jumped out easily, landing on the driveway. The smell hit me immediately.  

Rot.  

Sour and visceral, wrapping around my senses, suffocating my nose and throat.  

Mom’s summer house sat on the edge of town. It had once been my teenage getaway with human friends, the lake curling around it like a silver ribbon. 

I remembered the long stretch of field I used to play in. My legs moved, somehow.   

One moment I was standing outside the house, its wooden canopy and cherry blossom trees familiar, the rocking chair I used to curl up in and watch the sunset.

Then, like an animal, I was following the smell hanging thick in the air. 

I stumbled; my new senses felt wrong, my steps too quick, sending me to my knees. 

In that year I couldn’t remember, the year rage and hunger had ripped through me, what the fuck had I done?  

The smell led me to the field from my memories.  

Now it was unrecognizable, surrounded by barbed wire and a ten foot wall. Wooden stakes were driven into the ground, and through them, heads were impaled. 

Human heads. 

Thousands of them.  

I started forward, stumbling.  

Did we do this?  

They stuck out like puppets, fake, straw hair caught in the wind. 

A familiar face came into view: pale white skin, eyes long since popped from their sockets, skeletal teeth glittering in the late sun.   

Cornelius Invinia. 

Something thick and sour crept up my throat, a slew of slime. Maybe intestines.  

Whoever I had mindlessly devoured as a newborn.  

I passed another face that stood out. Her head was still connected to splintered bone forced through the stake, blonde curls catching the violent breeze.  

Aunt Emilia.  

Another head, its skull caved in, tongue a rotting slug hanging from its mouth.  

Uncle Wyatt.  

Lydia.  

Smallwood.  

Klause.  

Evangeline.  

I kept going, my head spinning, thoughts ignited, examining each one.  

Not humans. 

Vampires.

Our entire coven. 

The realization slammed into me, cruel and agonizing, as I found the one person I didn’t want to find, the one who buckled my legs.   

My trembling hands found what had once been her beautiful, youthful face, skin ripped from the bone, skeletal teeth still frozen in a scream. I barely registered my mother’s appearance as a human.   

I’d been selfish, always thinking of myself, never appreciating her beauty.  

Mom was simple-looking, thick brown hair pulled into a ponytail, skin pale as snow.  

Now my mother was nothing, an empty husk of decaying flesh, skewered on a stick.  

I stepped back. No tears. No suffocating throat or pain in my chest. 

I was beautifully numb. 

Mom was right. Human emotions would have destroyed me.  

“Hey!”  

The voice split through me, my nerve endings jerking.  

Humans.  

Two humans were coming towards me. Armed and masked.  

I didn't have time to look for Nick.  

Instead, I left, running away from the massacre of my family and the guilt of not being there to save them. 

Entering the city, I was determined to find Nicholas.

Alive.

I wasn’t expecting the looming mechanical wall splitting the highway. 

On it, a label read: ZONE 3.  

I joined a bustling crowd, all of them clutching black rectangles. 

I definitely wasn't in 1989 anymore.

Skyscrapers scraped the clouds, their windows forming a dizzying checkerboard. 

Yet I couldn’t ignore the vast expanse of screens on every building displaying flickering faces, almost like mugshots. 

Vampires.  

I stopped dead, staring up at one screen looming over me.

On it was the Claymouth clan’s leader. Anabelle. 

She had a bounty for almost 2 million dollars.

For a moment, I was frozen, glued to her unsmiling, bruised face and hollow eyes.  

Someone slammed into me, almost knocking me off my feet.

Humans weren't capable of that— which meant…

“Oops!” The person’s laugh split through my thoughts, and something twisted in my gut. “Sorry, dude!”  

The man stood over me, unchanged, as if time had skipped right past him.

“Sorry bro, I was miles away.”

His thick blonde hair was neatly cut now, no longer shaggy, no longer something I wanted to run my fingers through.   

Ray-Bans hid his eyes, his lips breaking out into a grin. His clothes weren’t his: a trench coat over jeans and a tee.   

On his wrist, a strange blue light glowed beneath his skin. The realization was quick.  

Nicholas’s son.  

When he whipped off his glasses, revealing those same coffee brown eyes, my heart flew into my throat. 

It was Nicholas.  

Relief collided with confusion and pain as he shot me a grin, a perfect, human smile.   

No spikes, no fangs.   

Nicholas held up a black rectangle, the screen lit up. His smile was the same, and yet everything else about him was wrong.

“Yes, I listen to Sabrina Carpenter.”

“Nick.” I managed to get out. “It's me.”

He inclined his head. “Is this some kind of TikTok thing you're doing?”  

I ignored that. “The coven,” I whispered. “Nicholas, they're all dead. The Montgomery coven. Nick, your father—”

The boy folded his arms, looking right through me. “Yep. Okay dude, whatever.""

He tried to step around me, and for a moment it felt like we were dancing again, like that night on the roof.

I couldn’t help it; I was drawn to him. Nicholas smelled like a vampire. 

No heartbeat. No blood. No warmth.   

I couldn't stop myself, closing the distance between us. I caught his face in my hands and forced my fingers between his lips. 

“What the fuck?!” He jolted away, eyes wide. Nicholas was strong, but not as strong as he should be.   

He shoved me back, and I easily got the upper hand, stabbing at his upper incisors where raw gaping gaps were. Gone.   

His fangs were gone.   

Ripped out, by the look of each jagged tooth and the trauma in his gums.

I jumped back, something ice cold sliding down my spine. 

Nick’s fangs had been purposely taken out.   

My fiancé eventually snapped, twisting my arm, and pinning me to the ground. 

Already, a crowd was forming around us. “Someone call the authorities,” Nick yelled, keeping me pinned to the cold concrete.  

“Nick,” I snarled, and his eyes shot open. He crawled back on his knees. 

He wasn’t fighting back. No ignition in his eyes, no curl in his teeth or primed senses, not even a flicker of fight. Nicholas was a full vampire acting exactly like a human.  

“Fuck,” he whispered. “It’s a bloodsucker!”  

I slapped him, and he drew back, lips parted.  

“YOU are a bloodsucker!” I snapped. 

I grabbed him, yanking him by the collar.  
“Your name is Nicholas Invinia.”  

Something flickered across his face, but he quickly blinked it away.   

He stunk of antiseptic.

“You have a birthmark shaped like Italy,” I whispered. “On your thigh.”  

My gaze dropped to his arm, where that blinking blue light pulsed under his skin, spiderwebbing down his veins.  

I grabbed his wrist. “Who did this to you?”

Nick violently pulled back like a startled deer.  “Get the fuck away from me!”

I ran.  I didn't have a choice.

Somehow, this world had discovered vampires.

Humans weren't scared of us—they were hunting us.

Changing us.

The only place to hide was a narrow alley wedged between a library and what used to be a bookstore. 

A café sat at the end, empty and quiet. 

Behind the counter stood a guy with thick brown hair with green streaks, a coffee apron slung over jeans and a tee. 

“We’re closed.” he said, gaze glued to a black rectangle.

“I need to hide,” I whispered, shutting the door gently. “Please. Just behind the counter.”  

The barista’s icy gaze didn’t waver. Steam rose from his own coffee, which he took delicate sips of. His freckles immediately pissed me off. “I said, we’re *closed*.”  

I didn’t have time for this.  

I rushed forward and pressed my fingers to his temples. He smelled like roasted beans and chocolate. Human. 

No clinical edge, no antiseptic stink. 

A wave of memories washed over me, too blurry to make sense of. I moved carefully, picking my way through his mind. 

My purpose was to control, not erase.   

His memories held a sickly scent, like rot, like each one was decomposing.   

“Let me hide behind the counter,” I said again, keeping my tone firm. “You didn’t see anything.”  

The barista’s eyes rolled back. “I… didn’t see anything,” he repeated.  

I pressed again, adding more pressure. “Let me hide.”  

His eyes flickered. “Yes, maaaaster.”  

I hesitated, drawing back when his lip quivered slightly. “Are you mocking me?”  

When he didn’t move, I reached toward him again, my fingers brushing his temples, but he caught my wrist in a flash.   

Fast.   

His reflexes were too sharp for a human, and yet he had a heartbeat.   

His grip was firm, his eyes sharp, lips curving.

“Standard vampire compulsion,” he said. “You know, instead of hypnotizing me, you could have just *asked*.” 

I took a step back. “You know about vampires.”

The barista’s brow lifted. “Duh. Do you know about *zebras*?”

A loud bang shook the door.

“Hello?” someone called. 

I dove under a table.

“We’ve had a report of a bloodsucker. Have you seen any?”

The barista didn’t miss a beat. “Nope. Just a…” His eyes flicked toward me, locking on. “Human.”

When they were gone, he turned the deadbolt fast.

“So, you’re a runaway vampire,” he said, arms folding. 

His gaze raked me up and down, circling me like a predator. “What’s your deal? Are you some kind of rebel, or an escapee from one of those rehab facilities?”

*Rehab facilities.*

We weren’t just being hunted. We were being erased.

I couldn’t answer. My throat locked up as I scrambled to my feet. ""I need to find Nick.""

The guy frowned. ""Who?""

""My fiancé.""

He twirled his car keys around a finger. “I can help you,” he said, voice easy, too calm. “But this friendship is transactional.” 

He stepped closer, eyes darkening. 

“I’ve got friends stuck in one of those facilities. Bloodsuckers go in, and mindless shells come out. You help me free them, I'll help you find your friend.""

“Why would you need a vampire for that?” I asked before I could stop myself.

He looked at me, steady and cold.

“Why do you *think* I need a vampire?”

…

The barista’s  name was Seb.

His car was too small. Too suffocating.  

It was either trusting this stranger, or being caught by humans.  

The seats smelled like leather and new-car smell.  I jumped when the glowing rectangle sitting on the driver’s seat flashed.  

Hesitantly, I picked it up. 

Something ice cold skittered down my spine. Didn’t Nick have one of these things?  

A familiar melody began to play, faint at first, growing louder.

Take on Me. 

The smells slammed into me, violent, a wave of nostalgia and agony.   

Candy, rain, Nick’s cheap cologne, and 1989. I didn’t need to breathe, and yet somehow I was panting, breathless. 

The world shifted side to side and I was back on the roof of the townhall, overlooking a starry night.   Nick was next to me, his legs resting on mine, head on my shoulder.  

I didn’t realize I was crying until I had to swipe at my eyes, my throat scratching, my voice hoarse.  

How?  

I frantically tapped at the glowing rectangle. 

There was no tape player, no on button, and it wasn’t coming from the radio. 

I checked it twice. The music was coming from the rectangle. It didn’t make sense. 

How could the barista have Nick’s favorite song?   

Footsteps startled me. Seb pulled open the door and eased into the driver’s seat, dumping a bag of fast food on my lap.   

I didn’t move, shoving the rectangle between my legs.   

He was damp from the rain, strands of sticky brown hair glued to his forehead, raindrops spattering his jacket.  

His scent wasn’t a threat, it curled easily into my nose and throat: fast food, sweat, and cigarette smoke. But already my nerve endings were on fire. This guy knew Nick’s favorite song. Which meant he knew me.  

“Okay, so I grabbed you a coffee,” he announced through a mouthful of burger meat, pressing a button. 

The car roared to life. 

Seb locked in his seat belt before turning to me, swallowing down burger mush. 

“Yo.” His expression pinched, lip curling. “You okay?”  

Instead of responding, I held up the glowing rectangle. “Your device,” I whispered. “How did you get that song?”   

I had to bite my tongue to hold back. “Was it you? Did you turn Nick into a human?”  

The guy’s expression crumpled. “Huh?”  

I didn’t hesitate. I threw my fist back and slammed it into his nose.  

His head arched back and slammed against the window. I lunged for the door, but it was locked. “What the fuck?” he snapped, snatching the glowing rectangle.  

“That’s my phone!” Seb yelled, slamming his hand over his nose. “It’s Spotify, you idiot.”  

Blood. The smell hit me, sharp, electric, suffocating. My head whipped around before my brain could register it, a slow rivulet of red seeping down his nose.   

It hit like I imagined drugs would. My vision blurred, feathering in and out.   

Logic burned away, and I moved. Fast. Too fast to keep up with. 

Somehow, I straddled him, pinning him to the seat.  

Leaning closer, the stench was worse and yet better, stronger than Nick’s scent, the scent I was so used to, filling me like home.  

This was different.  

Dangerous. 

The guy didn’t move; his eyes stayed on me, breath tickling my cheeks.   

His heartbeat was steady, pulse slightly elevated, pumping through his carotid.  

I ignored the feral, impulsive part of me drawn to the curve of his throat; I ignored the sharp burning on my tongue, the dull ache rattling through my upper incisors.   

Gently, I pressed my fingers to his temples and exhaled, applying pressure.  

Compulsion was all part of mindfulness, I was told. If you are not relaxed, the human mind will not subjugate.  I breathed in and out, and Seb’s expression relaxed, his pupils dilating, facial muscles weakening. 

All right. 

This boy has a past he didn't want me to see.

I saw flashes, like a rewinding video tape.

Barb wire fences, and lines of filthy, bloodstained teenagers.

“Seb.” I said cooley, letting his body fall against mine. “Tell me about your friends.”",2,1762231782.0,ByfelsDisciple,0,0.75,False

So the kid takes off without a word. Couple minutes later he’s back, holding a regular whisk like, “Could only find this one.”

It’s a CPA firm and it’s fair that I don’t know a single thing about cpa whatever in general. They hired me because the last EA left for her “dream job” in marketing. I mean this is my dream job ig, I’ve been an EA for almost 2 decades so I’m not doing anything else. She comes back after I’ve only been there for 2 weeks and I was excited I thought this would be cool cuz she would be a great resource right!? I love being in the workspace with strong women who help build one another up. Our controller is like that and her and I were fast friends! So right when she walks in I ask her if she’ll sit down with me and help me work through some tasks. She says sure lemme get settled all that and a few hours later she asks if I have time for a meeting, we go into a conference room and the first thing this bitch does is hand me a 3 page document with all the tasks listed out and our names beside them. She highlighted mine like I can’t read my own fuckin name but after I skimmed it I noticed she placed me (which is also fuckin weird cuz she’s like not my boss so who tf are you to decide this?) on all the menial bullshit like reception tasks - now I don’t mind doing these, but I mind that she decided to relegate me to picking up snacks and coffee so she could be the only one doing the partners scheduling and inbox etc. My immediate reaction was to tell her this was inappropriate, made me uncomfortable and walk away. After the partners came back she went to talk to them and now there’s a meeting on the calendar for all of us. Okay so first of all I just don’t like her, period, I don’t want to work with her and that’s wild when this was our first interaction - there was zero communication, no attempt at being cordial or navigating the future expansions of the office like nothing. I did ask my boss if this was something he asked her to do and he said no so she just took it upon herself to put me below her. Am I being too prideful?! Like should I just be glad to basically get paid to do nothing or?

1onyfpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1onyfpl/nacetyllcysteine_helps_me_to_sleep/,N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine helps me to sleep,"Lately, I had been dealing with major insomnia as usual.  I always have dealt with this for years now.  It is what causes me mood issues.  I really dislike missing my sleep.  It's something that I usually cannot control.

I took this Nac supplement after finding some with my older supplements lying around.  Nac I heard from someone to take at a higher dosage to help support it getting into your system.  Also, I read on bottle to take with a proteine dense meal.  I have done this and I take it early in the day to help with sleeping.  

I use it because since I began using it I noticed a curve in the total amount of sleep I am getting.  it's getting better over the last few days taking this Nac.

I am feeling really good and so I had bought another bottle off of Amazon.ca.  It is a really good Nac bottle.  I take 1800mg, that is 3 capsules of 600mg.  It is a good dosage for absorbing it better into my system because a small amount does less.

I found soon after taking the Nac that there was stress relief and it felt more so like I can release pressure from my voices talking.  I can see them without feeling the pressure of them  talking negativity as it may have seemed without a Nac.  Now, with a Nac supplement I can get past it and it's feeling great!

I feel altogether more sane.  It seems my body is absorbing the Nac really well thus far.  I have taken it for just over a week for sure.  I have to say that it's a relief that from every night I have noticed improved sleep since taking Nac.  

I now have sleep nightly or at weird times it seems but it's better because before i just didn't sleep ever.  I didn't get sleep and when I did I would do so at weird times and then awaken at weird times of the days.  This is not a good thing.  This is why the Nac can be a very good thing for me.

I looked up a study that people are doing.  There is a Nac stack.  It helps better for people like schizophrenics.  I am a schizoaffective with voices that I can hear and feel emotionally.  This Nac can stack with magnesium glycinate so take a mans dose which is 400mg, or for the average females dosage it is 300mg.

If you mix that with l theanine extracted from green tea it is a supplement that goes in the mix and somehow it does synergy like some caffeine and l theanine from green tea, or some coffee and a theanine supplement added to make for a better concentration.

I usually will take 250-500mg per 4-6 hours although the online says it's 10 hours that it wears off. I just need to keep it going because it helps with moods.  I take green tea as well so that can be a way to do it daily.  I actually can drink tea and take nac until bed and i do not have bad sleep anymore.  This nac does the trick!

When you mix those supplements I have stated with glycine from maybe [Ebay.ca](http://Ebay.ca) you may find the right source yourself.  Then, mix that with the stack and you have everything.  It's a 3g dosage every night before bedtime and it'll help to sleep really well.

Both glycine and Nac are precursors to glutamate synthesis in the brain.  Glutamate is a main antioxidant in the brain that helps with oxidative stress.  Both together can provide a stronger effect and this can also help with age related memory decline in the middle aged men, women who use it.

You have to look more into this yourselves.  There is so much on the internet I have read just through using Google AI.  You can do this yourself and look into the stack as it is being studied currently by the government.

God bless you!  I am a fellow schizoaffective and my name is Josh.  Just to be clear the stack is Nac, Glycine, magnesium glycinate, and l theanine.  Good day to you!",1,1762231364.0,schizoaffective,0,1.0,False

1onyd1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1onyd1w/the_heart_tree_part_1/,THE HEART TREE - Part 1,"""You alright, Jake?"" I asked. 

I found Jake standing by the kitchen sink with his fingers digging into his scalp. This wasn't the first time I had seen him get worked up, but it was unusual for him to get this way during a house party - I had known Jake long enough that I could set my watch to when one of his screaming panic attacks would follow the day after a big social event. So whatever it was that was causing Jake such intense stress was beyond the normal self-loathing he felt as a consequence of performing as the life of the party, which some part of himself must have felt deeply compelled to do.  

""Ian,"" said Jake, looking at me as if he had just found the solution to his problem. 

He noticed me noticing the blood under his fingernails. Muttering to himself, he turned on his heel and washed his hands at the sink. 

His hands washed, he cleared his throat and turned back to face me and smiled his signature 'everything's great' smile that had no real authenticity behind it. 

""Mate,"" I said, ""What's wrong? Has something happened?"" 

Jake's eyes shot to the left, then flitted back to me. 

""I can't talk about it here,"" he said in a whisper, ""I was getting Phillip a glass of water. I'll meet you in the upstairs bathroom in a minute, okay?"" 

After I gave a slow nod to affirm that I would, Jake finished filling a glass with cold tap water and hurried back to the adjacent living room where the party was in full swing. 

I made my way upstairs, and entered the bathroom, closing the door until it was slightly ajar. 

There was slippery sweat under my armpits, and my eyes felt slightly swollen in the dark  and warm confines of the bathroom. 

I felt on edge, and overwhelmed. All I wanted to do was retreat to my bedroom at the other end of the hallway and spend the rest of the night on my own. 

With nothing but the darkness and the muffled cacophony of laughter and music rising up through the house from the downstairs living room, my thoughts began to wander. 

It had only been a week since I had returned to my university house accommodation at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and the recent events of Christmas back home in South-East London were playing on my mind. Other than spending Christmas with my family, which was always a highlight of the year, I also had an unexpected catch up with my former best friend Ewan. 

And it was the thought of Ewan, and our last encounter, that had prompted me to offer to host the house party for my university friends. Besides Jake, Ellie, and Mark, the other 'friends' of mine that were currently partying downstairs were hardly more than friendly acquaintances, who I either knew because I lived with them at my current accommodation, or because they were part of the university's board game society which I had joined in my third year. 

Ewan wasn't one of the friends at the party. He was a friend from back home who I had known since around the end of secondary school, and all throughout Sixth Form college. 

Three years ago, just before I left home for university at the relatively late age of twenty-one, Ewan had told me about his plan to go to China in order to become an English teacher there. 

I remembered asking him how long he intended to go to China for. He told me: three years. 

*Don't do that*, I had said to him, *you'll become a robot*. *You can't just up and go and leave your friends and family like that. Besides, is China really the best place you could go?*

But Ewan had made his mind up.

We hadn't spoken again until he came back to England to visit his family over the Christmas holidays that had just come and gone. Ewan had reached out and messaged me, offering to meet up and hang out, and I had jumped at the offer. 

When I saw Ewan for the first time since he had left for China, he was noticeably fatter. 

He had always been short but stocky, and because of that he had played rugby throughout his teens (which subsequently had riddled his back with unfixable spinal injuries that left him in constant mild discomfort.) But when we had met at a local restaurant, and he had waddled inside, he was noticeably overweight without any athletic stockiness to compensate. 

That had been the first sign something was majorly wrong with him. 

After an awkward hug, he joined me at the table. And then, bit by bit, he told me what had happened to him during his stay in China. 

I remembered complaining to my Mum, the only person who I could really talk to about this sort of thing back home, about all the things Ewan had told me. 

""He almost died,"" I had said to Mum, ""Because the air in China is so polluted, he ended up getting a blood clot in his nose. He got rushed to the hospital and the doctors had to take out a clot the size of a slug out of his nose.""

Mum hadn't enjoyed the grizzly details. 

""And,"" I had said, ""Because the doctors had to remove the blood clot, Ewan's completely lost his sense of smell, and he can barely breathe through his nose. The slightest bit of dust in the air anywhere he goes is unbearable for him now."" 

I had walked around with Ewan after the dinner, and any time we stopped at a bench to sit down, he would become agitated, and would sniff and twitch, and he would eventually admit defeat and we would need to carry on our way. And during all this he would bend his back to pop and crack his spine to get some relief. And between each stop and start I had to walk much slower to compensate for his congested waddling pace.

And not once during the whole conversation during our day hanging out together did he admit or make any sign of regretting having gone to China. 

Not even after having to leave behind the cat he had spent three years treating as family, only for that same cat to be abandoned by the owners whose care Ewan had entrusted it in. His Chinese girlfriend who he met at the university where he taught English had given his cat to her parents, who had promptly abandoned the cat to the streets and lied about doing so whenever the topic was brought up during phone calls.) 

That meeting with Ewan had been our friendship on fumes, and more of a reunion in honor of the good friends we once were.

*But him leaving for China hadn't been what had ended the real friendship, had it?* I thought, still sitting in the dark of the upstairs bathroom with my brooding thoughts.

*The friendship ended because he got sick of me,* I thought. 

He had said as much during our latest hang out. 

He had mentioned how he had a full week of catching up with other friends from school, all of whom I had never managed to befriend myself. 

""It's funny,"" I had said to Ewan, ""How you have so many other friends and I never got to know them.""

I had said this in a somewhat whimsical way, because I knew how much of a social outcast I had been throughout most of my school life.

""I guess people don't like feeling like they're being judged,"" Ewan had said in response. 

And that comment, more than anything else Ewan had said, had really been the final nail in the coffin for our friendship. 

It wasn't because I had noticed the self-importance with which he had made that comment. Ewan had always had an easy time making and keeping friends at school. He did so by playing the clown, and otherwise being blandly affable in any social situation. Something I knew he didn't like about himself because he had told me so. Our friendship had seemed unique in comparison, because when we talked, back in the early years of our friendship, it was hard for us to stop talking about life, the universe, and everything. 

What pissed me off about Ewan's comment was the dismissal of the idea that *judging* in and of itself was wrong. That, because I had my own point of view that differed from his that I was somehow the *judgemental one.* 

*Because I care about you?* I had thought, *Because I give a shit enough about you to try and stop you from making mistakes you'll regret for the rest of your life?* 

I imagined myself saying\*, If you had listened to me you wouldn't have had that blood cot, you wouldn't have to abandon that cat, and you wouldn't have to order the absolute hottest possible curry your local Indian takeaway because you can't taste anything with a Scoville score less than three-hundred-thousand.\* 

But I had bit my tongue and kept things as polite as I could manage, because I had figured out that as far as Ewan was concerned, my advice was worthless. 

Jake was the closest friend I had made since Ewan. 

We had met during our first year at University because we shared the same campus accommodation. Separate rooms, but the same shared living space. 

Jake was his own can of worms, perhaps more riddled with problems than Ewan. 

Jake's light thumping footsteps met my ears above the unbroken sound of laughter and shouting from the others downstairs. 

""Hello?"" said Jake.

His smiling face emerged at the ajar doorway. 

""Hey,"" I whispered.

Jake moved in, brushed by me, and moved over to the toilet. He set the lid down and sat.

""Mate, what's wrong?"" I said in a whisper.

""I can't say,"" said Jake.

""You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, mate,"" I said, ""I just want to know if you're in any kind of trouble.""

""No, it's not like that,"" said Jake, pitifully, ""It's…it's just…ugh, I can't say.""

My cheeks were fuzzy from the two large cans of energy drink I had imbibed and followed up with two regular bottles of vodka-and-lemonade. The alcohol content from the vodka-and-lemonade was so minimal there was no chance that I was drunk. But considering I rarely drank, and was therefore a major lightweight when it came to alcohol, I still felt noticeably tipsy.

Jake on the other hand had finished half a bottle of vodka on his own, and had shown very little sign of slowing down.

""Ugh,"" Jake groaned, ""I think I'm going to have a panic attack.""

""Is there anything I can do?"" I said.

Jake shook his head slowly from side to side. Muffled laughter rose and fell again from downstairs.

""Sounds like they're having fun,"" I said.

Two things happened then.

The first, was Jake began to let out an increasingly agonised whine that would soon become uncontrolled sobbing.

The second, was the sudden all-at-once arrival of a golden light so bright the only thing I thought it could be was the beginning of a nuclear bomb blast.

I had checked my phone a few minutes prior to inviting Jake to go upstairs to the bathroom with me to talk, and it had been close to 9PM around that time. It had gotten dark around 4PM, and we weren't on the side of the house which would have streetlights shining in from outside.

The new light pouring in from the bathroom window was brighter than peak daylight to the point I had to look away and shield my eyes.

Screams from the others downstairs broke out too.

And then just as Jake's sobbing reached its peak, a sound, like an explosion, reached my ears.

And it was so loud I was certain it was a bomb. It had to be. What else could make such noise? It drowned every other sound out and made it impossible to think of anything else.

Unable to see anything but bright burning gold light, and ears pierced with the catastrophically thunderous and unrelenting noise; I wondered if this was how I was going to die.

If it was a nuclear bomb, or some similar doomsday device unleashed on the populace of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, the shockwave blast hadn't yet reached us.

One second passed after another and still the near blinding gold light and the terrible noise like thousands of drums being played right outside the house continued.

I had already pocketed my phone into my right jeans pocket, which left me with my hands free to stuff my index fingers into my ears to muffle some of the painful thundering.

The sheer unfamiliarity of what was happening had forced Jake out of his panic attack. He had his hands to his ears and his face was squinting and bathed in gold as he shouted something at me that I couldn't hear. At a guess I figured he was shouting my name.

As much as it hurt to do so, I removed the finger from my left ear and pulled down the bathroom door handle. The second I had the door open I put the finger right back because it felt as if a screwdriver were being dug into my ear canal during that brief lapse.

I inched out of the bathroom and made sure Jake was following me before continuing on. With me leading, we both inched our way down the stairs.

The house hallway was similarly bathed in gold from the biblical levels of light.

Is the house going to catch fire? I wondered.

The light was hot, like standing outside during a heatwave, which only worsened my fears that I was right – that there really had been a nuclear bomb that had gone off.

But it had been maybe thirty seconds since the light and noise had started. Would it take that long for the nuclear bomb's shockwave to reach us? And wouldn't the radiation from the light cook us all alive way before the final destructive force?

Afterimages, like negative coloured splotches, hovered over my field of vision. Even with my eyelids closed for as long as I dared to keep them shut whilst continuing down the hallway, it felt as if I had many hot lightbulbs shining in front of my face.

I reached the living room at the back of the house and saw the bulk of the others standing near the sliding glass door. There were more than a dozen of them standing there, the light making them like scorched silhouettes.

And then all at once the light stopped, as if a switch had been flicked. My vision went dark, and the splotches in front of my eyes continued to bob and roam and block me from making out much of anything around me.

Several seconds later the thundering noise stopped too. In its absence was silence pierced by a continuing shriek that I was sure was the aftermath of my eardrums suffering such brutal noise for so long, and not an actual sound to be heard.

Over the course of a few minutes the best I could do was remain off to one side of the room hoping that I wasn't going to be near deaf and blind for the rest of my life.

My hearing normalised first. The panicked crying and whimpers from some of the others in the living room met my ears. And soon after my vision adjusted to the darkness of the room, which was lit by a dim bulb light hanging from the ceiling.

I knew, because I was the one hosting the house party, that there were fifteen of us including myself in the house.

""It's a nuclear bomb!"" someone shouted.

It was Tyler.

He was very tall and gangly, with long sandy-blonde hair tied back into a ponytail. The most distinctive items Tyler had worn for this evening were white and red-striped arm warmers that matched with his red and white converse shoes, on top of his overall effeminate grunge style.

""If it's a nuclear bomb the shockwave would have hit us by now,"" I said.

""I bet you France is cooked!"" said someone else.

It was Jack. About as tall as me at five foot seven. Unlike me, he was Pakistani-Asian, whereas I was White-British.

Also like me, Jack wasn't dressed effeminately, only three other guys at the party liked to dress in a girl-ish way, and neither Jack nor I were one of them. Instead I was dressed in a button down checkered shirt and blue jeans, and Jack in a simple dark green shirt and blue jeans.

""What do you mean?"" I said.

""Isn't it obvious?"" said Jack, ""France just got bombed and that was the blast!""

""There's no way,"" came a monotone voice.

It was Ben, the other tall guy of the group. Dressed in a shabby hoodie and blue jeans, with messy short hair.

""If it was a nuclear bomb we'd all be dead.""

""So what was it?"" said Jake.

He was standing close to me, and his face, no longer bathed in gold from the light, nor the darkness from the bathroom, was instead a natural bronze from his Malaysian heritage. His scrawny body was clad in tight blue jeans and a bright pink sweater with an anime-style teddy bear depicted across the chest.

Nobody had an answer. Over on the leather couch against the rear wall two of the girls, Georgia and Megan, were sitting and holding each other's hands for support.

I found myself grinning despite the horrible pit of dread gnawing in my stomach, perhaps because this was by far the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life.

""Maybe it's an alien invasion,"" I said, half-joking.

""Ian, that ain't funny,"" said another voice.

I saw Jake whip round to look at him first. Standing at the doorway, blocking most of it with his bulk, was Mark. He was about the same height as me, but much broader on account of his dedication in the last half year or so lifting weights and eating the right foods to bulk up. He did, however, look like he had just wandered out of his bedroom because he was wearing a simple tan t-shirt and brown three-quarter-length shorts, and he was wearing his usual dorky sandals.

""Maybe it was a solar flare,"" came another voice.

Over on the couch, next to Megan, his girlfriend, was Eddie. He was a bit shorter than me, with a square-ish head and his frame drowned in an oversized hoodie. I couldn't remember what it was he was currently studying at university, but I knew it was something that required a lot of brains.

""If it was a solar flare all our phones wouldn't be working,"" said Georgia.

She was a very rotund girl with a head of long curly hair, and she also happened to be Tyler's girlfriend. Her eyes were wide open, as if she were on drugs. Her hands, still holding onto Megan's, were trembling.

Because of Georgia mentioning our phones, everyone in the room retrieved their phones to take a look. The light from all the screens filled the dimly lit living space some more.

""My phone's still working but I don't have internet,"" said Jack next to me with his phone in his hand.

Tyler let out an aggravated rasp.

""Yeah I got no internet either,"" he said.

Several of the others in the room mumbled they also had no internet on their phones. I checked my phone and, like the rest, I didn't have any internet.

""Maybe we should check outside?"" came another voice.

It was Dave, Mark's younger brother. He looked a lot like Mark except a year or so younger and without any of the benefit of having lifted weights.

""No, you're not going outside,"" said Mark, in a way that left no room for debate.

Dave listened to his brother without further rebuttal.

""So it wasn't a solar flare, probably,"" I said, ""Because the lights are still on and our phones are still working. And it wasn't a–""

I had to stop speaking to swallow, my mouth feeling incredibly parched all of a sudden, and the fear which gripped me was making it hard to catch my breath.

""--and,"" I said, once I took a moment to breathe, ""it wasn't a nuclear blast because we're all still alive. Even if it hit France or wherever I bet we'd all be dead right now.""

""What if it was something stupid?"" said Phillip from a chair in the corner of the room. Philip, like Jake, was very scrawny and even more effeminate in his mannerisms. Unlike Jake, he was also mixed-raced African.

""Like,"" he said, ""What if it was like a big firework or something?""

""That wasn't a firework,"" said Ben.

""Then what was it?"" said Georgia, and then she pointed at me, ""And don't say aliens.""

I threw my hands up mock guiltily to help lighten the serious mood. This earned a few forced laughs from some of the others in the room, if only so they could let themselves feel something other than terrible dread about whatever had happened, and perhaps was still happening.

""I don't have any signal,"" said another boy who was sitting in the large green leather armchair in the corner of the room, adjacent to where Megan and Georgia were sitting together.

It was Oscar, a portly boy with a head of balding hair despite being only around eighteen years of age.

""I don't think we can even call the police,"" he said.

Besides Oscar, was Gary, who, out of everyone in the room, seemed to be paying the least amount of attention to what had just happened. Instead, as was typical for him, he had a beer can in his hand which he contentedly drank from until the can was empty. And then he promptly started on what was likely his tenth (conservatively speaking) can of beer for the evening (any morning or afternoon drinks he might have had not included.)

I decided to walk over to the sliding glass door which, were I to open it, led to the back garden. I saw my reflection in the glass and some of the faces of the others watching me from over by the couches around the coffee table (which was swamped in both opened and unopened bottles and cans of alcohol, with plenty of mixers too.)

The living room was humid, sweaty, and stunk of alcohol. What I wanted was fresh air, but I didn't dare open the sliding glass door yet.

Instead I raised my phone to the glass and used the phone's torchlight function to see further into the veil of darkness.

Out in the back garden was the large leafless tree which must have been there for decades. Besides the tree I could see the patchy garden grass, and thorny bushes, but nothing out of the ordinary.

""Do you see anything?"" said Mark from the doorway on the other side of the room.

""Nothing abnormal,"" I said.

I put my hand on the glass, and it was then I noticed I had spoken too soon.

Something was falling in heaps outside.

Because I was shining the torchlight the others caught a glimpse of the same falling stuff before I could call it out.

Some of the guys raced to the sliding glass door and peered out, using the torchlight functions of their phones to add to mine to see what was happening outside.

""Is it ash?"" said Jack.

""It looks like ash,"" said Ben, ""But it's not.""

""How do you know?"" I said.

""Because if it was ash everything would be on fire outside,"" said Ben.

""Let's open the door and we'll be able to tell,"" said Philip.

He reached for the sliding door latch. Right away myself, Ben, and Tyler took hold of Philip's arms to stop him.

""Okay! Okay! Get off me! GET OFF!"" Philip shouted.

""Don't open the door,"" said Ben, keeping his grip on Philip like iron.

There wasn't anything personal about the way Ben said this in his usual monotone voice. But he was panicking like the rest of us.

""I won't, get off,"" said Philip.

Ben let him go, and so did the rest of us who had taken hold of Philip – for his protection and our own.

""The air could be poisoned,"" said Jack, ""We better not risk it.""

""Is everyone okay?"" came a new voice.

It was Ellie. She was one of my housemates, and had simply been doing her own thing in her room when all the commotion began. She had her usual glasses on, and was in her pajamas.

""We're okay,"" I said, ""We're just trying to figure out what all of that even was.""

""It was mad, init?"" said Ellie, ""I nearly shat myself when it started.""

What she just said earned another round of nervous laughter from most of the people in the room.

""D'you think it was thunder and lightning?"" said Ellie.

""Maybe,"" said another voice.

This time it was Megan. Her voice was quivering from stress. Her hands gripping hold of Georgia's just as much as Georgia was gripping hers.

""It started with just light,"" said Megan, freeing one of her hands to adjust her glasses, only to put her hand right back to firmly gripping Georgia's again, ""And then the light came a few seconds later. Just like thunder and lightning. But way bigger.""

It was then I noticed the white puff of air leaving my mouth. The day had started cool, but not cold. And even over the recent Christmas period it hadn't been cold enough to be more than chilly.

Everyone in rapid succession noticed their breaths catching in the air too. Not only that, we could all feel the temperature dropping.

A cracking noise began to fill the air, and it was then those of us closest to the sliding glass door noticed frost climbing all over the glass.

I placed my hand against the glass and immediately noticed how cold it was.

""How is it getting so cold?"" said Philip, ""The glass is frosting up!""

Ellie joined those of us who were standing at the sliding glass door.

""This is bad,"" she said, ""The temperature shouldn't be dropping like this.""

It was strange seeing genuine fear from Ellie. It simply wasn't an emotion I had ever seen from her, besides one time I pulled a particularly good prank on her. She was, perhaps second only to Jake or Mark, the person I was closest to in the whole house.

""Oh gosh,"" said Jake, suddenly.

He began to race to the doorway where Mark was standing off to the side from where he had moved to let Ellie in.

""Jake, where are you going?"" I said.

""Rebecca,"" said Jake, ""She's still in her room. I'm going to check on her.""

Jake didn't wait for a response. Philip, his best friend since they were little, hurried after him. I decided to stay where I was.

I began to shiver, my teeth chattering. I wasn't dressed at all for the cold. What sweaty humidity had been in the room before was gone.

It was then Gary rose from his spot on one of the couches and, with a beer in his hand, he raised a toast to everyone.

""Well,"" he said, in his usual slurred speech, ""If this is the end of the world, at least it's going down at a party. Cheers!""

He chugged the entirety of the beer, dropped the can to the carpet, and crushed it underfoot.

""Hey!"" I shouted, ""Don't mess up my carpet!""

Gary looked both genuinely shocked at realising the bad of what he had just done, but also as if he were only half-awake.

""Sorry, sorry,"" he slurred, ""I won't do it again, I'm very sorry.""

I took a deep breath, which felt crisp and cold as if I had minty chewing gum in my mouth.

""It's fine,"" I said, ""Just be respectful, mate. Any damages me and the rest of the housemates are going to have to pay for it.""

""Come here, it's alright,"" Gary slurred.

He stepped closer and embraced me in a hug. He reeked of booze and cigarettes; two smells which immediately brought my Dad to mind. I patted Gary on the back a few times to let him know there were no hard feelings, and eased away from him.

""Piss it!"" someone shouted from the kitchen.

It was Mark.

Most of the others in the living room were busy checking their phones, trying to get any signal to make contact with the wider world. Others continued to peer out to the garden, where the newly falling snow – that had to be what it was – was falling with entrancing Yuletide heaviness.

Which left just Ellie, Jack, and me, as the ones who hurried out of the living room at a brisk walking pace into the adjacent kitchen, which was just to the left down the hallway.

Ellie was the first to enter, followed by me, and then Jack behind me. We arrived just in time to see Mark cursing several times as he wound the top hung windows shut using the hand levers.

Even from the other side of the kitchen, which was about three-to-four strides in width, the cold blowing in from the windows was like pain in aerosol form.

Mark shoved his hands under his armpits to get them warm, his face winced in pain.

""You okay?"" said Ellie.

""Yeah, great,"" said Mark, sarcastically.

Then Ellie gasped. Before I could ask why she took a small piece of white plastic away from where it was set on the lime-green kitchen wall. It was a piece of plastic I had never cared to notice before.

""It's below zero degrees centigrade in the house,"" said Ellie, both amazed and panicked.

""How cold is it exactly?"" said Mark.

""This thermometer doesn't go lower than zero,"" said Ellie.

""You know what?"" said Jack from behind me.

The rest of us looked over to him.

""What if this is like in Millennium Warcry?"" He said, ""In the Millennium Warcry books there are these portals – warp gates – that open up. They require a vast amount of energy to open. They can make the weather go haywire.""

""So aliens after all, then?"" I said.

Jack, like Ellie, also looked both panicked and excited.

""It'd be more like interdimensional space demons,"" said Jack, ""Though to use Warp Energy usually requires mass sacrifice of millions of innocent souls.""

""Well,"" I said, ""We'll add that to the list of possibilities.""

""Hey, I'm just saying, it could be,"" said Jack.

""Yeah, yeah,"" I said, ""There's just a bit of a gap between a solar flare or nuclear bomb, compared to, you know, interdimensional hell demons. But hey, if you're right, I'll give you five quid.""

""Really?"" said Jack, ""How about twenty?""

I shrugged.

""Deal,"" I said.

We shook hands on it. This was fine with me, I didn't expect interdimensional hell demons to be the likely cause, but I did want to keep the mood among everyone in the house light-hearted.

""You know, it could be global warming?"" said Dave, who was peering in from the doorway.

""It's not global warming you idiot,"" said Mark.

""Okay,"" said Dave, ""Just thought it might be. Makes more sense than a sodding Warp Gate. No offense, Jack.""

""Hah,"" Jack laughed, ""It's cool.""

""Crap,"" I said.

I'd just realised something.

""Ian?"" said Ellie.

I turned to her and Mark.

""Can you both make sure everything is sealed inside the kitchen and living room? No air gaps to let the cold in? If it gets any colder we're all going to be in serious trouble.""

""Yeah,"" said Mark.

""Yeah, good idea,"" said Ellie.

""Good,"" I said, ""I'll make sure upstairs doesn't have any obvious gaps.""

""Erm,"" said Dave, from the doorway again, ""Maybe we should get blankets and stuff for people down here? It's cold.""

""We know it's cold,"" said Mark, ""But yeah, good idea. We'll see to that after.""

It was hard not to notice how happy Dave looked to receive a positive affirmation from his brother for a change. I felt a little relieved about it too.

Mark and Ellie, joined by Jack and Dave, set to work making sure any and all ways for the cold to get into the house from the ground floor was blocked.

With that being handled, I hurried upstairs to do the same for the other rooms. I had hoped the motion of running up the stairs would have warmed me up some, instead it made me that much more aware of how not dressed for the cold I was.

Alone after reaching the top of the stairs, without the warmth of the others around me, the whole situation seemed far bleaker and scarier. Goosebumps spread over my arms, and my socked feet were numbing from the cold.

Before I could reach my room, which was the room at the far end of the hallway from the stairs, I stopped at the doorway adjacent to my room – which was Rebecca's bedroom.

Inside the room were Jake and Philip, who were kneeling on the ground with Rebecca who was sitting like an overweight panda wearing a pink onesie between them.

And it was then I noticed Jake was busy trying to pull a loosened noose cord away from Rebecca's neck. Her neck, which looked raw and bruised from the cord already having dug hard around her throat.

Rebecca's eyes were open but also downturned, as if she were close to falling asleep. For several surreal moments I simply stood and stared at Rebecca – because I couldn't see if she was breathing.

Finally, I noticed the rise and fall of her chest, and then several hampered coughs escaping her.

I looked around the hallway to see if anyone else might have followed me up the stairs. It was a needless gesture, but I did it anyway just to be sure.

I then moved into Rebecca's bedroom.

Again, I couldn't find the words to ask what had happened, and was happening with Rebecca.

The three of them took notice of me.

""It's okay,"" said Jake, ""Rebecca just had an accident.""

""Accident?"" I said in a whisper.

There was an accusation in my tone because, right there above Rebecca's head where she was sitting, was the noose cord tied to the doorknob of her wardrobe.

Jake finished removing the noose from around Rebecca's neck, and from the wardrobe doorknob.

""Stay with her?"" said Jake, to Philip.

""Don't go,"" Rebecca whined in a tiny voice.

""I'll be right back,"" said Jake.

He patted Rebecca's thigh and then stood quickly and hurried over to the bedroom doorway.

""Want to go to my room?"" I whispered.

""Yeah,"" said Jake.

He closed Rebecca's door behind him and then we moved into my bedroom. I closed the door. I noticed also that my bedroom window was already shut, making there no need to close it. My bedroom was on the side of the house where the streetlights could shine in from the window. They were shining in, but much fainter due to the sheer volume of falling snow outside. Or at least, it was what I assumed was snow.

""What's going on with Rebecca?"" I whispered, ""Did she just try and–"" I struggled to find the right words yet again, ""--take her own life?""

""Mhm,"" Jake mumbled.

Then, after an uncomfortable silence, he whispered, ""It's not the first time she's done this.""

""What?"" I said, alarmed.

""I know, I know,"" said Jake, ""Usually she just does it because she wants attention. She has mood swings. The other times she's done this all she needs is some food and drinks she likes and some company.""

""Are you nuts?"" I said, struggling to stop myself from yelling, ""She had a noose around her neck, man.""

""I know,"" said Jake, ""I didn't know what to do. The university already knows about it. She's been going to counseling sessions.""

""Mate,"" I said, ""Don't you think this was something you might have wanted to mention to me? My room is right next to hers.""

""I know,"" said Jake, again, ""But I didn't want to make things worse for her. She promised me not to tell anyone else about it.""

My head started to spin. I sat on my bed, which was unmade and littered with the clothes I had tried on and decided weren't the kind of fashion I wanted to wear for the party.

""So she just tried to take her life?"" I said.

""I don't think she was really trying,"" Jake whispered, ""I know it sounds bad but it's more of an attention thing.""

""You said that,"" I said.

""The big explosion outside shocked her,"" said Jake.

""Shocked her?"" I said.

""No, not shock-shocked,"" said Jake, ""She was getting herself ready and then the explosion startled her and then she actually started to – you know. All the other times she just sort of sits there with the noose around her neck. She texts me what she's doing and then I come and help her.""

""Jake,"" I groaned.

""It's fine, it's fine,"" said Jake, ""It's all fine. Just leave it to me and Philip. Please don't tell anyone, okay? Please.""

There was a pause. Not because I was deliberating what to do, but because I simply felt overwhelmed with everything that was already happening. The big golden explosion, or whatever it was, was bad enough. Though Rebecca and I were certainly not close and in fact didn't like each other all that much, the idea that she had just attempted suicide, and in fact had toyed with attempting suicide several times before was simply beyond the pale.

""Okay,"" I said, finally, ""Does she need anything? There's a first aid kit under the kitchen sink.""

""No, she's fine. She just has a sore neck,"" said Jake.

Jake opened my bedroom door.

""I need to get back to her,"" he said, ""Thanks for understanding.""

""Wait,"" I said.

Jake stopped.

""Yeah?"" he said.

""Was this what you were trying to tell me about?"" I said.

Jake shook his head from side to side and whispered, ""No.""

""You want to tell me now?"" I said.

""Later,"" he said, ""It's not important right now.""

Jake then made his way back into Rebecca's room and closed the door behind him.

I let out a ragged sigh.

1onycy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1onycy0/she_matched_first/,She matched first,"It started the way everything starts these days. With a swipe.  
I hadn’t had sex in a while, so I decided it was time for some Tinder fun.

Her name was Luna. Just one photo. Blurry. As if it was taken with an old phone. No bio. No shared interests. Just her name. And those eyes — far too sharp for the resolution. As if they were looking through the screen at me.

I don’t know why I swiped right. I wasn’t even looking for anything serious. Just bored. But the moment we matched, something felt... off. She sent the first message. “I see you.”

**(Gino):** Haha, okay then. So... what are you in the mood for? What are you looking for here?

**Luna:** Connection. Something that stays. Something that doesn’t disappear when the sun rises.

**Gino:** Deep answer 😅 Most people just say “fun” or “vibes.”

**Luna:** Fun fades. Vibes vanish. I want something permanent.

**Gino:** Permanent like... a relationship?

**Luna:** Or something stronger. Something you can’t delete.

**Gino:** You’re intense, Luna 😄 But I kinda like it.

**Luna:** I knew you would. You’re ready.

**You:** Ready for what?

**Luna:** For me.

**You:** So... are we meeting tomorrow?

**Luna:** Yes. Tomorrow night. At your place.

**You:** Perfect. I’m looking forward to it 😏 Might skip dinner and head straight to bed lol.

**Luna:** That’s fine. The bed is where it begins. And where it ends.

We met two nights later at my place. She didn’t want to go out. Said she preferred quiet places. She walked in like she’d been there before. Her fingers glided along my shelves, her eyes scanned my walls. She didn’t smile. She didn’t smile. She just looked.

We drank wine. Talked a bit. Her voice was soft — almost too soft. She didn’t blink much. But I was drawn to her. Like gravity. Against all logic, we ended up in bed.

Her skin was cold. Not “I’m chilly” cold. More like... ice. The sex was colder than her skin. Not distant — just lifeless. It felt like I was moving against something hollow, something that didn’t respond. No breath. No sound. No emotion. Her eyes stayed open the whole time, staring past me like she saw something I couldn’t. Her body was stiff, unmoving, like a doll. Not resisting. Not participating. Just... there.

It didn’t feel like a connection. It felt like a transaction. Or worse — a ritual. When I looked at her, she smiled. Not warmly. But with certainty. As if she had claimed something.

I woke up the next morning and she was sitting upright in bed. Not sleeping. Not scrolling on her phone. Just staring at me. “You chose me,” she said. Her voice was deeper now. Hollow. As if it came from far away. I laughed nervously. Asked if she wanted breakfast. She didn’t answer. Just stood up and walked to the living room. Sat on the couch. Stared at the wall.

I tried to act normal. Made coffee. Asked if she needed a ride. She slowly turned her head and said, “Why would I leave? You let me in.”

I called my friend Tom. Told him something weird was going on. He came over. I pointed to the couch. “She’s sitting there,” I said. He looked confused. “There’s no one there, man.” I laughed. Thought he was joking. But he wasn’t. He couldn’t see her. No one could.

From that moment on, she was always there. Sitting at my kitchen table. Standing behind me in the mirror. Lying next to me in bed every night, eyes open. She whispered things. Not words — just sounds. Sometimes I’d wake up with her face inches from mine. Sometimes I’d hear her footsteps when I was alone.

I moved. She came with me. I deleted Tinder. She laughed. Every time I brought someone home, they were gone by morning. No messages. No calls. Just gone. And then I’d see a new photo on Luna’s profile. A blurry image. Of them. With her eyes in the background.

I tried to film her. Just static. I tried to record her voice. Only noise. I tried to touch her. My hand went through. But sometimes... I swear I felt her heartbeat in my chest.

I don’t know what she is. A ghost? A demon? Something digital that escaped? But I know this: She was my match. And now I’m hers. And every night, just before sleep takes me, I hear her whisper:

“Swipe again. I dare you.

1onybta,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1onybta/22m_quit_my_stable_job_5_months_ago_now_im_lost/,"22M, quit my stable job 5 months ago, now I'm lost and don't know what I'm doing anymore","Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I just need to get this out somewhere.I resigned from DMart back in June. It was actually a decent job  worked in back operations, had a good team, learned a lot about FMCG. But here's the thing: I saw people stuck in the same position for 5 years with barely any salary growth. Add some office politics and the feeling that I wasn't moving forward, and I just... left.
Thought I'd find something better easily. Spoiler: I didn't .
A bit about me  I'm 24, completed my BSc CS in 2023. I know, computer background, but honestly? I'm way more interested in operations and business than tech. Before DMart, I worked at coffee shops, did Zomato delivery for a while. I've dabbled in graphic design, video editing, even learned how social media algorithms work because I was interested in content creation. But I never really committed 100% to anything, and that's probably why nothing took off.
Here's the part that's eating me up: I'm scrolling Instagram and seeing 14-15 year olds planning their entire day, working on themselves like crazy. Meanwhile, back when I was that age, we were just playing cricket and wasting time. No hate to my younger self, but man, the difference in self-awareness is wild .I'm extremely introverted. Not because of COVID  I've been like this since childhood. My grandma knows I hate weddings and functions. Never went on stage in school or college except once when they forced me. I have friends from school and college, but no one I'd call a best friend. No one who calls me just to check in, you know? 

My first two college years were online. Didn't have a smartphone until first year, so I missed out on learning a lot of important skills everyone else was picking up. Got my phone, completed graduation (73% in 10th, 52% in 12th, 71% in graduation  pretty average everywhere), and realized I don't want to be average anymore. Don't want to just sit at a screen all day .

Now it's been 5 months since I quit. I'm working on a startup idea and preparing for a government exam. I know I have potential, but I seriously lack discipline. My parents are getting older, and my dream is to give them a better, safer life. But somehow I'm losing the charm, the hope, the goals... everything feels confusing .I guess I'm just wondering has anyone else been here? Stuck between multiple paths, knowing what you should do but not actually doing it? How did you figure it out?
Sorry for the long post. Just needed to vent",22,1762231011.0,pune,8,0.9,False
1onybcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1onybcj/bunch_of_guys_in_the_hot_tub/,Bunch of Guys in the Hot Tub,"It was late last night and I hear a bunch of guys laughing their asses off sitting completely naked in the hot tub that I brushed and added chlorine to for the apartment I live at. 

It was Sunday night and I was getting the scaries for today's classes especially as it's harder waking up early to go to Wooden with my pre-workout coffee in one hand and my dick in the other. Plus, it was Sunday night. I wrote down all the little tasks and things I needed to between classes and my lunch break while waiting in line for everything (i.e. the slow-ass Post office which is never really open at better times and lacks self-service kiosks outside of it), health center for my flu shot, which I would've been better off getting elsewhere at a third party location...the whole Monday rush. 

So with all the shit and responsibilities I have to do on my mind, I went and raised my voice at these arrogant dirty guys talking about the girls while naked together. I didn't cuss them out. I acted drunk and put my hand in my crotch humping my hips back and forth saying ""wait a minute, wait a minute..."" I told them that my name is Dooler and that I was going to piss in the tub. That's when all of them got up and left. One of them even came and tried guiding me to the garden nearby so I could piss there. 

I farted and that's when the naked guy touching my arms himself had enough of me and grabbed his clothes and met with his friends who had their towels on inside. 

And then these two girls walking by noticed one of the guys and tried to yank the towel off of him. He was holding onto dear life while bending over to hold the towel and keep me from going blind!

If I take a sample of the water to Leslie's Pool supply, do they have a panel for STD's? 

The hot tub is the best place to play Who Would You Rather....because everyone is mostly naked. ",7,1762230969.0,ucla,2,0.62,False

1ony75x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ony75x/first_talking_stage_how_to_proceed_20m_21f/,"First ""talking stage"", how to proceed? [20M, 21F]","So I've known a co-worker of mine for about two years now, didn't know her the first term we worked together, and didn't interact with her once. Second term, I saw her in person for the first time and thought she was gorgeous, decided to check out her Instagram, and saw she had a boyfriend in her PFP, so I backed off. 

Come summertime, she asked me for help over our work messenger, which led to us talking all day, every day on our work computers (literally all day), and even a bit on Instagram as well. I thought we were getting along absolutely great, but even though it took her a while, she brought up her boyfriend again in conversation, so I again ceased all plans to try and pursue her (still talking as friends/co-workers obviously). She bought me coffee on our last week, as we thought we were going to be laid off (we didn't end up getting laid off), and we kind of kept in contact during the school year as it started, texting every couple of weeks.

Now, last week I sent her a work-related reel, and the next morning she replied with a reel (work-related), essentially telling me she'd broken up with her boyfriend a couple of days prior. We talked that day and a little more the next two, but I decided not to continue the conversation and leave the ball in her court, as I don't want to try and pursue someone in a vulnerable state, especially after having broken up with a long-term boyfriend. 

She sent me another reel today that was about ""work besties,"" implying that I was her 'work bestie'... and told me she missed our ""work chats"". So then we talked for a bit and I thought it was going well, until (and without going into all detail), I asked her where she planned on studying. She said she wanted to stay in our city, and I told her it was a good idea, as the other option was a small town University and my friend currently goes there and says it absolutely sucks. She then replied to this with ""maybe it's what I need though to be honest, move away and find a country man and live on a farm 😍"" and ""They live a simple life and spoil their girls"". The problem is, I am the furthest thing from a ""country"" man, and that comment left me confused and frustrated.

Am I reading too much into this? Maybe this comment was made as a joke, but I do not want to be with someone who talks directly to me about other guys. We talked a bit after, but I chose to just not reply to one of her messages and go to bed. 

I apologize if anything here is obvious. This is the first girl that I have really ""talked to"", so I am not very experienced in the whole dating scene. Thank you in advance!

Almost 2 years ago he was diagnosed with heart failure. Hes spent the first year teaching me how to drive across the state and making sure I could live without him. I think it was his way of coping with everything. Ive spent every moment since I heard heart failure slide out of that doctors mouth like he was making a coffee order, trying to keep him alive. I don't know how to live in a world that he doesnt exist in. I know if that dreaded day ever comes, whether it be soon or 70 years from now, I will never recover. He's worried about hospital bills and credit card debt he'll be leaving behind for me to have to deal with. Im worried about how I'm going to come home everyday to a house that no longer smells of his cologne and isn't filled with his laughter and our happiness. He's worried that I'll completely lose it like his mom did when his dad passed. I'm worried that his mom will hate me and blame me for his passing as if I haven't done everything within my power to keep him alive and happy. Every single day I wish it was me that was sick instead of him, atleast then I'd never have to live in a world without my best friend. I have so much hate for the doctors that screwed around with his diagnosis and let him get so sick before finally listening to us. Im so angry that the health care system has failed him so many times. He deserved so much better than this and I hate myself everyday for not fighting so much harder for him.
