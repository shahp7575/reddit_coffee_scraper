## Key Features Analysis

The best ottoman coffee tables often boast a combination of design, material, and construction to achieve a balance of aesthetics, durability, and functionality.

**Upholstery Material**

The upholstery material plays a critical role in both the look and feel of the ottoman coffee table. Options range from luxurious genuine leather to durable faux leather, soft velvet, and practical fabrics like linen or microfiber. Genuine leather offers a premium look and develops a unique patina over time, while faux leather provides a more budget-amiable and easy-to-clean alternative. Velvet upholstery adds a touch of glamour and softness,while linen and microfiber fabrics are known for their durability and stain resistance. The choice depends on your personal style,lifestyle,and budget--the best upholstery will resist stains and scratches and feel comfortable to the touch.

**Frame Construction**

A sturdy frame is essential for the ottoman coffee table’s longevity and stability. High-quality models typically feature solid wood frames, such as hardwoods like oak, maple, or birch. These materials offer extraordinary strength and resistance to warping or cracking over time.Less expensive options might use engineered wood, like plywood or MDF, which can still provide adequate support but may not be as durable as solid wood. Look for reinforced joints and corner blocks to ensure the frame’s stability and prevent wobbling. Make sure the legs are firmly attached and designed to bear a ample amount of weight.

**Storage Capacity**

Many ottoman coffee tables come with built-in storage, adding a practical element to their stylish design. Storage options include lift-top compartments, drawers, or open shelving. Lift-top compartments are ideal for concealing blankets, pillows, or remote controls, while drawers offer a more organized storage solution for smaller items. Open shelving provides a display area for books, magazines, or decorative objects. Consider the amount and type of storage you need to determine the most suitable storage configuration.A well-designed storage ottoman helps declutter your living room and keeps essential items within easy reach.

**Dimensions and Shape**

The size and shape of the ottoman coffee table should complement your living room layout and furniture arrangement. Square or rectangular ottomans are versatile and fit well in most spaces, while round or oval ottomans can add a softer, more contemporary touch. Consider the scale of your sofa and other furniture pieces when choosing the dimensions of the ottoman. It should be large enough to serve as a coffee table alternative but not so large that it overwhelms the space or obstructs traffic flow. Measure your living room carefully and map out the desired placement of the ottoman before making a purchase.

## faqs Section

consumers frequently enough have practical questions when considering the purchase of an ottoman coffee table.**What is the suitable height for an ottoman coffee table?**
Ideally, an ottoman coffee table should be the same height as your sofa seat or slightly lower. this ensures that it is indeed comfortable to rest your feet on and easy to reach for drinks or snacks. Generally,a height of 16 to 18 inches is a good starting point,but consider the specific height of your sofa when making your decision.A coffee table that’s either too high or too low can be uncomfortable and awkward to use.

**How do I clean and maintain an ottoman coffee table?**
The cleaning and maintenance requirements vary depending on the upholstery material. For leather ottomans, regular dusting and occasional conditioning can help keep the leather supple and prevent cracking.Faux leather and fabric ottomans can be spot-cleaned with a mild detergent and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners,as these can damage the upholstery. Regular vacuuming can also help remove dust and debris.

**Can an ottoman coffee table be used on hardwood floors?**
Yes, an ottoman coffee table can be safely used on hardwood floors, but it's essential to take precautions to prevent scratches or damage. Use furniture pads or felt protectors under the legs of the ottoman to cushion the contact between the legs and the floor. This will help prevent scratches, dents, and scuff marks. Regularly check the furniture pads and replace them as needed to ensure they remain effective.

My girlfriend and I are visiting Australia this November. She'll be attending a biotechnology conference in Adelaide, and then we're heading to Sydney for some exploring. We'll be there for a couple of weeks in total.

While she's at the conference, I'll have some free time and I'd love to connect with some locals. I'm a big fan of sightseeing and exploring cool spots, but I'm also a keen birdwatcher!

1mgt1ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1mgt1ci/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Experience with BUNN CSB3T Review,"The BUNN 55200 CSB3T Speed Brew Platinum Thermal Coffee Maker is an intriguing piece of equipment. I’ve spent several weeks putting this coffee maker through its paces, making everything from a quick solo cup to larger pots for family breakfasts. It advertises itself as one of the fastest coffee makers in the market and boasts commercial-grade features for home use. While it's impressive in many ways, there are also aspects that I believe are worth considering before making the purchase. Let me break it all down for you.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its matte black finish paired with a stainless-steel backsplash and top-band accent. Not only does it look stylish on the counter, but its design feels well-thought-out. The compact dimensions (8.3"" D x 13.9"" W x 14.9"" H) mean it doesn’t dominate my kitchen space, and it blends seamlessly into the room. The choice of materials also gives it a sturdy, durable feel, which I appreciated in daily use. Its simple manual operation, with clearly labeled buttons, made the learning curve quite minimal. I liked that everything feels intuitive – no endless menus or unnecessary tech bells and whistles.  

**Strong Points****  
- The internal commercial-grade stainless steel hot water tank keeps 70 ounces of water always hot and ready to brew a full pot or a quick cup.  
- Brewing speed is fantastic; it takes only about four minutes to get a full pot ready and even less for a travel mug.  
- Maintains coffee at an ideal serving temperature with its vacuum-insulated, double-walled thermal carafe.  
- The taller funnel design works well with BUNN filters, preventing the dreaded overflow of coffee grounds.

[Check BUNN CSB3T price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b07gy6phyz/)

**Performance – A Coffee Lover's Dream**  
The performance of this machine has genuinely impressed me. The BUNN 55200 CSB3T delivers a full carafe of coffee in just four minutes, which is a lifesaver on busy mornings. It lives up to its ""Speed Brew"" name, keeping hot water ready at a moment’s notice. The multi-stream spray head evenly drenches the coffee grounds for consistent extraction, replicating what you might expect from a café-style brew.  

Another standout feature here is the temperature control. The hot water tank keeps water at the perfect brewing temperature without exceeding 200°F. With other coffee makers, I’ve sometimes found my coffee tasting burnt, but not with this one. The results have consistently been rich, smooth, and flavorful. Even my picky relative who is somewhat of a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur gave this a nod of approval.  

**Caveats**  
- Always keeping the water tank preheated adds to energy consumption.  
- While the thermal carafe is supposed to maintain temperature for hours, the coffee didn’t stay piping hot as long as I expected.  
- Paper coffee filters need to be purchased separately as none are included with the machine.  
- The machine design, while efficient, does require regular cleaning to maintain optimal performance.  

**Easy to Use for Households Big and Small**  
I found the machine incredibly easy to operate. Pouring water into the bowl is simple, with a clear indicator showing how much has been added. Whether I used it for personal mornings or when hosting friends, it was a breeze to transition from brewing a single serving to a full pot for guests. It’s suitable for both individual use and group settings, so no matter the size of your household, it adapts wonderfully.

**Product Contenders**  
Comparing this coffee maker with others in the same category, it certainly stands out for its speed and convenience. Machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Breville Precision Brewer also offer high-quality brewing, but they fall short when it comes to brewing time. The Moccamaster, for instance, takes several minutes longer for a carafe, and while the Breville offers programmable features, it can feel overly complex for those looking for something straightforward.  

On the other hand, competing brands such as Cuisinart might offer all-in-one features like built-in grinders, which the BUNN lacks. However, simplicity is where this coffee maker thrives. It’s for those who want premium coffee without needing to fiddle with endless settings and configurations.

**True Value**  
This coffee maker comes at a premium price range, reflecting its commercial-grade build and performance. While there are budget models out there, they often lack the durability and speed this one offers. After comparing with similar options, I do think it’s a worthy investment for coffee lovers who value convenience and consistency. You’re essentially paying for café-quality coffee at home without waiting in line. That being said, if you’re a casual drinker or more budget-conscious, you might want to weigh if the speed and features align with your needs.

1mgszz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parents/comments/1mgszz1/teenage_girl_dont_talk_and_wanna_leave_house/,Teenage girl don't talk and wanna leave house,"Hello. I am not a parent (27F), but I need help with my teenage sister (she will turn 16 this month).

  


Recently, our whole life has turned upside down. This year, my sister finished school and was supposed to continue her education somewhere. Before, I had the impression that she was planning to go to medical school (she paid attention to chemistry and biology). However, suddenly everything changed: she no longer wants to study, and moreover, she plans to run away from home.

  


I don’t know where to start. We have a big age gap, and I’ve always tried to be a trusting adult for her. It’s as if only yesterday we watched movies together, played games, she told me about boys, and asked for help when she got her first period. And now I realize I know nothing about her.

  


She said she doesn’t want to go to medical school. I can fully support this decision because there shouldn’t be people in medicine who were forced into it. I would support her choice to pursue any other education, but she says it’s just a waste of time. She plans to go to a local college to learn to be a cook and then work as a barista or bartender? I told her that working in the service industry is one of the most thankless jobs, and there isn’t even a bar in our tiny town, and she probably has never been in one to understand what it really looks like. But she doesn’t listen.

  


She said she wants to leave home. I grew up in the same house. I understand that my parents aren’t perfect, and my father sometimes oversteps (at least when he’s paying attention), but it’s definitely not a family where you get beaten, forced into hard labor, or financially restricted. She just doesn’t realize how lucky she is that at the grocery store she can choose any snack she wants, at the clothing store any item, ask for an upgrade on her gadgets, or pay medical bills. Yes, I understand that what family can provide isn’t limited to material things, but that’s already more than many teenagers have.

  


She wants to live on her own, although if she really wants to run away from her parents, I offered her my apartment (I live alone in another city just an hour away), and she said there wouldn’t be friends there and that I’m not enough for her? It’s a big city, and any education or work experience gained here would be more valuable? I don’t understand her; at her age, I was in love with the idea of moving to a big city.

  


I could understand if she didn’t want any education at all. I’m not a snob. If she wanted to develop herself in a specific field, I would support her. But honestly, all she does is scroll TikTok and watch k-dramas? If I didn’t want to go into medical school, I think I would have gone to art school (maybe that’s what my parents actually expected from me). She has no hobbies tho.

  


If she leaves home without a plan, her only options are living with a friend’s family or something similar—but they probably won’t let her freeload forever. She planned to start working and rent an apartment, but I don’t know who would rent an apartment to a girl who looks like she’s 14??? Are there such people???

  


In the end, I broke one of my main rules: confidentiality. My family values respecting personal space. If I had read posts about how parents “casually” check their kids’ phones or set parental controls, it always sounded like science fiction because my parents never did anything like that. I am very respectful of personal space and have always respected my sister’s space too—but now I am extremely worried. Today she accidentally left her unlocked phone in my room. For a short while, I accessed her messages on my laptop (I planned to stay there just in case, but it seems she noticed something was wrong and disconnected access). Here are some points:

  


She believes that our parents don’t care about her and want her dead—right at the moment when dad is taking her from hospital to hospital? She has internal organ issues; some doctors told dad it might be due to trauma—but investigations are ongoing; I don’t want to jump to conclusions. Maybe surgery will still be needed—this could worsen if she cuts ties with the family. Dad thinks someone hit her at school—but she hasn’t told me anything about conflicts or incidents.

  


She smokes (vape). I didn’t know this before; we talked about it once—she asked about my experience—and I never judged; my best friend smokes heavily.

  


She calls another girl “sister,” probably referring to her best friend with whom she plans to study and live temporarily—this girl shares my name. Honestly, this hurts me.

  


She has a boyfriend—I know his name only; he seems nice from their messages? His age is unknown—if he studies and works, he should be only slightly older than her. They discuss sex—I know it’s normal for teens but seeing this makes me see my sister as a victim of pdf; besides being underage—she looks like a child—baby face, undeveloped body… Our father sl\*tshames her for talking with boys; he did the same with me at her age (though I avoided guys altogether). But i personally never was rude about it—I’ve always tried not to interfere with her personal life we used to discuss these things —but now she hasn’t told me anything herself.

  


She still seems fond of our mom—which is good because our mom is the sweetest person ever—and if my sister crosses boundaries too far… well, then no forgiveness.

  


She said dad hit her and left a scar (more like a visible mark). I saw it on her arm but didn’t pay much attention; she didn’t tell me herself either—I dislike our dad but refuse to believe he would hit his wife or child outright—I don’t know if she's exaggerating or if something really happened.

  


She claims she's working—in an office dealing with packages? She spends almost all time at home except when going out (our parents aren’t restricting her movement now).

  


She mentioned having a friend—the daughter of our neighbors—who also ran away before but was found and placed in psychiatric care/orphanage? My dad said she's there due to s\*lf-h\*rm/s\*\*cide attempts—and their family was dysfunctional—I don’t know exactly what happened but they hung out with some group of friends? Anyway—I think my dad has enough connections that he could even involve psychiatric authorities if he wanted (though probably mom would oppose). My sister expressed concerns about this.

  


Some things from her search history (I have full access since she was too inexperienced with accounts) worried me: pawnshop address???? Should I worry??? Unlike money—gold isn’t stored in safes in our house....  there are also many rental offers for apartments/jobs/colleges nearby—even those in my city—so at least she's considering options even if something turned her off.

  




Now I'm stuck in a situation where I'm genuinely afraid of going against my sister—to lose what little trust she still has—and remain completely unaware of what’s really happening. She asked me for money—a sizable but reasonable amount enough for only one thing: rent or food for a month in a small town—but I'm not going to give it yet. She asked me to go with her for college documents because mom won’t—but again—I won’t do that either. Her only other option might be going with the friend’s mother—and time is running out for applications.

  


Today my father asked me secretly do one thing: block her phone number so he can take the phone “for repairs” and cut off all contact with “bad company.” So I did it.

  


I don’t know how this will turn out—I don’t know what else to say besides one promise: my door will always be open for her—even if right now it seems like she doesn’t want to come through it—but I won’t go against our parents either; after all—I am their last child (before us my dad failed with three sons what a loser lol).

  


when i'm at home I feel like everything around me is just paper life—everyone knows about problems but nobody talks about them because nothing has helped so far. Tomorrow was supposed to be my interviews; smiling and pretending everything’s fine—but now all these thoughts won’t leave me alone: heart rate 120 bpm, tears, trembling hands—I drank more coffee than water—I don’t know how to act—I don’t understand what she's thinking.

  


I was very independent as a child—and even among “bad” company—I didn't let myself get involved into doing anything forbidden—even under peer pressure—and always knew what course of action was right without needing parental approval: i loved studing, finished school good, got a job, started living independently—as i always wanted.

  


I can’t understand why my sister can’t do the same —and maybe never will understand —but I have only what’s here now. all my real friends are my peers—and of course childless except for one pregnant friend whom I definitely don’t want burdened further so i have no one to talk about",1,1754251465.0,Parents,1,1.0,False

This study explicitly stated a synergy between Carnosic Acid and Idebenone, both of which I had planned to upload. (Carnosic acid is already uploaded).      [*this is a repost*](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/z404cd/the_synergy_between_idebenone_and_carnosic_acid)  

https://preview.redd.it/h3n3rqo02vgf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d37ab698176935c37443bc0789fcb6b3af4b402

Idebenone activates the electron transport chain, complex 3, to generate ATP and reduce oxidative stress.

Unfortunately, due to its lower lipophilicity, it can accidentally inhibit complex 1, which in an isolated environment can generate oxidative stress. However, in healthy cells, the existence of NQO1 naturally counters this, which is why Idebenone is not toxic, and generally beneficial.

But NQO1's production is limited by Nrf2, which just so happens to be what Carnosic acid stimulates.

From section: Idebenone and combination therapy: wave of the future?

""Therefore, idebenone and an Nrf2-inducing agent may be a strongly synergistic drug combination that is far more effective than either drug alone

https://preview.redd.it/pbyvzxp22vgf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25e20bba80e8c6ad4a52ac222ffefb035a10bbd7

Carnosic acid was described by the same group to activate the Nrf2 pathway in both neurons and astrocytes and exhibit protection against focal ischemia/reperfusion brain injury \[81\].""

Something similar was found with chlorogenic acid, which is naturally found in coffee (caffeinated or not). But by comparison, Carnosic acid is far more potent.

""Carnosic Acid (CA) is a pro-electrophilic compound that, in response to oxidation, is converted to its electrophilic form. This can interact and activate the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE transcription pathway, triggering the synthesis of endogenous antioxidant “phase 2” enzymes. However, given the nature of its chemical structure, CA also exhibits direct antioxidant effects.""

Despite being a direct antioxidant, these indirect mechanisms relate to Idebenone in their specificity:

""Overall, the current data strongly suggest that, instead of being a direct antioxidant, idebenone increases the ability of cells to counteract oxidative stress by upregulating their physiological defence mechanisms and decreasing the production of oxidative radicals. However, there is significant doubt that protection against ROS-induced damage is the only molecular activity of idebenone that confers cytoprotection.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708875/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708875/)

Idebenone directly activates the electron transport chain complex 3, irrespective of any upstream damage. This is important because it means it directly facilitates the production of cellular energy (ATP) and reduction of oxidative stress, keeping cells impervious to damage and maintaining their excitation. As noted before, in unhealthy patients the only perceived weakness of Idebenone can be reversed with Carnosic Acid.

The increased ATP from Idebenone prolongs excitatory currents from AMPA, which makes it function similarly to ampakine style AMPA PAMs: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511959/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511959/)

This also probably explains how electric monitoring predict a nootropic effect in healthy people subjected to an experimental cerebral deficit model: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706371/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706371/)

Notably Idebenone appears to increase the release of noradrenaline and serotonin, with no effect on dopamine: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2987589/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2987589/)

And Carnosic Acid mimicks the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines without any GABAergic function by increasing serotonin and decreasing noradrenaline (I find it sedating, use it to go to bed sometimes): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260165234\_Key\_role\_of\_carnosic\_acid\_in\_the\_anxiolytic-like\_activity\_of\_Rosmarinus\_officinalis\_linn\_in\_rodents](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260165234_Key_role_of_carnosic_acid_in_the_anxiolytic-like_activity_of_Rosmarinus_officinalis_linn_in_rodents)

Carnosic Acid is known to be perhaps the strongest antioxidant found in nature. I have Idebenone coming soon I'm going to try out, but I have no idea what to expect from it. It will be a neat n=1 experiment.

Fun fact about Carnosic Acid before I end the post, it seems to increase neurotrophic growth factors too. Initially I tried it because I read it upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase, this was a while back when I thought that meant something, but instead got super sleepy from it. Come to find out it's not at all stimulating.

Toast

Coffee

Butter (and some jam, maybe?)

Scrambled eggs

Bacon

That seems like a very hearty breakfast for a woman who mostly leads a sedentary lifestyle and is considered ""elderly"" in universe.

Compare that to Cora's breakfast trays (Cora is the Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey):

Toast with butter and jam on the side

Tea

Maybe a glass of OJ (because Baxter read in a magazine that ""Murican's love their OJ"")

Fresh fruit

Porridge (""oatmeal"" for us Yanks)

Semi Hard Boiled Eggs, with a dollop of caviar to enjoy them with, or maybe some smoked fish

Are the differences in Cora's and Agnes' breakfast trays cultural? Or perhaps temporal? Cora is supposed to be a younger woman than Agnes so maybe Cora's tray is on the lighter side to maintain that youthful energy?

Maybe Agnes requests her scrambled eggs and bacon because she's earned a hearty breakfast after years and years of watching what she eats as a noted ""society beauty""?",1,1754251380.0,thegildedage,2,0.67,False

1mgsyap,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mgsyap/the_kid_everyone_laughed_at_just_saved_the_company/,The Kid Everyone Laughed At… Just Saved the Company.,"There was this new intern at our company, Kevin. Quiet kid. Wore oversized suits, always spilled coffee, and got mocked by the louder guys in the office. You know the type—they called him “Newbie Neo” because he was into programming and The Matrix.

I didn’t say much, but I noticed something: every time we hit a tech issue, Kevin was already quietly running diagnostics before anyone else even started panicking.

One day, our company’s website went *down*. Completely offline. During a major sales event. Leadership was losing it. The senior devs couldn’t trace the issue. Everyone was shouting over each other.

Kevin raised his hand and said, “I think it’s DNS poisoning.”

They laughed. Actually laughed at him.

But I remembered seeing Kevin poring over network security docs during lunch.

So I told the CTO, “Give him five minutes.”

He did.

Kevin pulled up the logs, traced the corrupted DNS entries, and found a misconfigured API call that had been exploited.

He fixed it.

*In three minutes.*

Website back online. Customers saved. Crisis averted.

Afterward, the same guys who mocked him were suddenly calling him “Kev the Savior.”

Me? I just gave him a nod and said, “Good work.”

A week later, the CTO offered Kevin a full-time position—double intern pay.

The moral?

Never judge someone by how they carry their coffee. Sometimes, the quietest person in the room already has the answers.

I was diagnosed with PCOS last year, after having so many doctors tell me “you don’t look like you have PCOS.” I was working with a naturopathic doctor at the time, and I followed the advice of gentle and low impact workouts, working out less but focusing on weightlifting, eating 3x a day with protein, and taking creatine, omega 3s, vitamin d, and a bunch of other supplements.

Fast forward a year I gained almost 30lbs and experienced the worst mental health episodes of my life. I tried unaliving twice and I’m still so depressed.

The running and cardio and intense workouts managed the intensity of depression/anxiety and perhaps even insulin resistance? I started taking up fighting sports again this year, along with yoga and weightlifting. But because of all the weight gain, it triggered me into my ED episodes and I’ve only been eating twice a day, or I’ll make a matcha or coffee to curb my hunger.

I also started taking progesterone the week before my periods (so I don’t unalive myself), and spiro 100mg daily.

The weight still won’t budge. I’m exhausted. No matter if I workout, don’t workout, eat more, eat less, it’s like nothing works and I’m going insane 💔 please help!

Transcript

50:00heed that you not be deceived, for many will come in my name, saying, I am he,

50:06and the time has drawn near. Therefore, do not go after them. But when you hear

50:12of wars and commotions, do not be terrified, for these things must come to  
50:18pass first, but the end will not come immediately.

50:24Then he said to them, ""Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against

50:31kingdom and there will be great earthquakes in various places and famines and

50:38pestilence and there will be fearful sights and great signs from the

50:44heavens."" So all those again these are the word of Jesus Christ.  
50:51If you read your Bible, if you see this verse uh again these words probably in  
50:57red in your Bible, that means that it's it's Jesus uh words. Um we are

51:04definitely seeing all this happening right now. We are definitely seeing all this

51:09happening right now in our time.

51:14And Jesus says that all these

51:19all these events must happen. He also said that when you see these

51:25signs know that I am near. And look a lot of people always say Louis war and

51:31earthquake have been going on and this and that. But uh here's the thing. Jesus is coming.

51:38God is giving plenty of chances to people to repent. All right? There's a

51:45reason why God hasn't there's a reason why Jesus has not showed up yet because

51:51God is a patient God. God is waiting for every person to hear the gospel and  
51:57people to repent. God is not going to be rushing. God

52:02wants many people to walk away from the things of the world and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior and receive the gift of

52:09the Holy Spirit. I mean sometimes as Christians we want Jesus to come. Ah  
52:14come on Jesus hurry up you know we want to go to heaven but sometime we could be greedy. We just think about oursel and

52:21not others. We need to go out and share the gospel. We cannot just you know

52:27think about the rapture 24/7. we have to go uh share the good news to to many

52:33people out there. You know, again, there's some, you know, there's a lot of people that visit the prisons. You know,  
52:40you got some people go with their Bible and talk to the correction officer. Hey,

52:46my name is so and so. I want to know if I could like read some Bible verse to

52:51some of the inmates in prison. Um, you know, there's people out there that goes to the hospital. Hey, my name is so and

52:58so. uh I want to know if I could just go and pray for um the people that are in need of

53:04prayers. So again, that's what you call being disciples, going out and doing these things because that's what Jesus

53:11commanded us to do. All right? So it's not about 20, you know, going on YouTube

53:17and throwing in certain prophecy and stuff like that. No, Jesus command us to go out, go out and help those. go help

53:27many. Even Jesus visited those places when he

53:34was here. You know how many times Jesus was locked up? You know how many times

53:40uh the disciples were locked up? You know how many times the Apostle Paul was  
53:45thrown in prison? I think he served 10 years if I'm not mistaken. I think he served 10 years and he was still

53:51preaching the gospel. I mean Paul was was being persecuted

53:59the disciples James

54:04his death he was beaten by a club and one of the club one of the person

54:10just busted his head and I'm not going to say too much but you have one of the disciple he he was

54:19he was peeled alive they removed his and um they torture him. Then you have Luke.

54:26I think Luke was un then you have John the Baptist. He was beheaded.

54:33And then you have Peter. They say that Peter was crucified upside down. I mean you had uh again you had uh again

54:42uh Paul he was beheaded too if I'm not mistaken.

54:48Jesus fishermen, these disciples, they went out and they did, you know,

54:56what Jesus commanded them to do, to go out and share the good news. And they did it because they truly love Jesus and

55:01they believe in Christ. Many of them died horrible death, but they did it for

55:08Christ. One of the disciples, uh, his name is John of Patmas in the book of

55:14Revelation. He was exiled to Patmas. I think that's an island

55:19not too far from Turkey. Uh so he was exiled. He was not persecuted. He uh55:25again the Bible doesn't say how he died. But uh he was he was exiled. And so in

55:30the book of Revelation, if you read the book of Revelation in John of Patmas, he talks about all these end time stuff55:36that is going to come. He was the only disciple that didn't see like really hard persecution.55:43Now there will be time us brothers and sisters in Christ is going to be a time that we also going to face persecution.55:50This is why you must read your Bible because through harsh times if you've55:58been thrown in jail and you being whooped and everything you be in pain but you going to memorize the beautiful56:04words that Jesus has left us. Those words is what's going to keep you strong56:10spiritually. The pain cannot overcome the blood of Christ, the words of Christ. So you must56:18read scriptures. You must come together with your loved ones and come together56:23and read the Bible and share those good memories, man. Because one day as56:28brothers and sisters in Christ, we will see persecution. Jesus says it. Said it.56:34Excuse me. Where is Connecticut? What? Hold on.56:40Where in Connecticut? Oh, it doesn't say where in Connecticut. It doesn't say where in Connecticut. It says that it56:46was spelled in Connecticut, but it doesn't say like which part. All right. So,56:54if the people is full enough, a few might be able to jump out.57:11Oh, guys, I just uh I just reached the uh past the uh the one hour. But hey, I57:19want to thank every single one of you. Uh for those of you that want to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior,57:26again, you know, if you need like anyone to talk to, I'm here. You know, I talk57:32to a lot of people when it comes to, you know, Jesus Christ. If you are dealing with any uh addiction with alcohol or57:40like drugs or cigarettes, if you need any anyone to talk to, I'm here. I was57:46uh I was I was a big drug addict. Um, I was into drugs and pills and I was into57:54alcohol and cigarettes and um, you know, I almost almost almost um lost my life58:01due to overdosed and um, but uh, Christ gave me a second chance and from there58:07you know I just never looked back. Um, I stopped everything. I stopped all that58:12and it's not again it wasn't it wasn't easy. That's why I stutter a lot because I took so much of those very very bad58:19stuff. But um I did stop a lot of those drugs. I stopped everything I did. The58:25only thing I drink is coffee and um and water. But it was not easy. The most58:31difficult part was cigarettes. Cigarettes was so hard. Cigarettes again, you know, I stopped weed. I58:37stopped everything. But cigarette was difficult. But it came to a point that I just I said nope. I went to the store58:44and I bought a brand new pack. I bought a brand brand new pack and I came like it wasn't here. It was in this house,58:50but I bought a brand new pack. I came out. I went to uh spark a cigarette and58:56then I saw my family. I saw my kids through the window and they were just59:01running around and I saw my wife chasing them and I'm here about to spark a cigarette and something hit me.59:10you know, I'm like, if I keep smoking a cigarette, you know, eventually it's going to lead to health problems and I59:17could, you know, something, you know, could happen to me at a younger age. I'm like, I should be in there with my59:23family. And that's what I did. That brand new pack, I just threw in the trash and I went in there and just grabbed my kids59:31because family is much more important. Family is is is a gift from the Lord.59:40And um yeah, it just that that moment right there, that's that you know what59:45hit me um seeing my family. So if you guys need any advice, you know, how do59:51you do it? Well, stay in prayer. Stay busy because when you think about59:57cigarette, I mean, you thinking about the nicotine, your your body is craving nicotine. So you have to constantly stay1:00:03working, working, working, working. Stay busy, busy, busy. And uh you know just I1:00:09know it's hard but uh again just you know you got this. You got this. And1:00:16once you achieve it you feel like you could achieve anything else. You know1:00:27I smoked cigarette for 20 years. When I was 15 I smoke cigarettes1:00:33when I was 15. No, I think when I was 12. When I was 12 years old1:00:40and I used to smoke at least six, no, I used to smoke like 12 cigarettes a day.1:00:46I never took a day off. 20 years, no days off. And then something happened. I1:00:52started feeling like my throat there was something in there like a ball. And come to find out it's because smoking a lot1:00:58of cigarette and you start coughing and then your vocal box. I mean, you start they put a camera down my throat and1:01:04everything and I'm like, but again, it's been many years and I've1:01:10been clean and I was 130 lbs. Now I'm like 205 lbs.1:01:18Most of it is in the gut. All right. Hey, who's uh who's that? Give me a1:01:24second here. Timothy. Timothy. That's a good name. You know,1:01:31we were debating either reading the book of Timothy or Samuel. We decidedh to go1:01:37with Samuel. Uh Lewis, you gave a testimony three weeks ago and it really hit me.

And to everyone out there, I1:02:34mean, you can do it, you know, you could do it. Just just focus, you know, stay strong.1:02:43What in the world is going on here? I'm sorry, guys. I hear something.1:02:59I don't know. Might be the cats. Anyway, guys, I'mma go in. Thank you so Wow. Thank you so1:03:07much for the 600 likes. Actually, it's 5.99. We were close. So,1:03:14yeah. Um I have a lot of frogs here. I have a lot of them. And guys, for those of you that don't1:03:20know, um we got a letter from the uh the county and we have chickens and we had1:03:28the chickens for almost two years and there was never a problem, but we have to get rid of our chicken. The county is1:03:35being really strict. They said that we could have the chickens, but we need to1:03:41hide them. We cannot show it like show the view. We have the fence, but the1:03:46fence that we have is just one of those regular fence, but they they want us to have this big fence like 9 ft high and1:03:54everything. And we cannot show the chicken coop, which is uh it just I1:03:59don't know. Uh I have to do some more research on that. But um we have until August the 18, we1:04:07have to get rid of our chickens. Uh we can only have four and um we cannot have1:04:13the rooster. And that's my favorite rooster. That's mine. You know, we had that rooster for two years and I have to1:04:19get rid of them. Um, so we're going to where someone came,1:04:24they picked up five. My wife was not happy. She was really sad about it. And1:04:30you know, she loves the animals. And again, we save animals. We uh we rescue1:04:35dogs and cats and we have like this big big family of animals. We could keep the dogs and cats and the rabbits and stuff1:04:42like that, but we cannot, you know, have too many chickens. So, they said only1:04:48four. And the rooster, we're not supposed to have a rooster. Um, but um1:04:53yeah, and they said that uh we need to get a fence in order to have the four chickens. I did call the company and1:05:01yeah, I turned them around. I said, ""Yeah, I'm not going to be paying that much money."" Uh, I told my wife, ""Look,1:05:08I promise you, uh, eventually we're going to move to another state. We're going to get a nice house. And, uh, I1:05:15promise you, we're going to get, uh, twice as much as chicken."" You know, the1:05:21Lord again, just, you know, we put our faith and trust in the Lord, you know,1:05:26and um, but yeah, you know, it's like they want us to go buy eggs at Walmart.1:05:32We were getting like 25 eggs a day. And now it seems like we only getting1:05:38like five or six. But uh yeah, those chicken they love us. Every morning when1:05:43we go to the backyard, they know what time it is. Um so they go out and they1:05:49stay under the deck. Um they have their food and everything. And yeah, we had1:05:55them since they were baby chicks. All right.1:06:01Jesus Christ is our savior. Jesus Christ is our only savior. There's no other way1:06:07to the father but through the son. Amen to that, Sanders. Amen to that. I keep1:06:12hearing a, you know, people's like, there's other ways to go to heaven. Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't know why people1:06:18keep saying that. There's no other way. There's only one way, and that's through Jesus.1:06:25You know, someone asks Donald,1:06:30""Donald, are you going to make it to heaven?"" And Donald said, ""Yes, I believe so because I do good things and1:06:38I'm a good person."" That was a bad response by Donald. And Donald being at1:06:45a certain age like that, he should have more understanding when it comes to salvation. I don't know who Donald is1:06:52surrounded by when it comes to, you know, preachers and stuff like that, but1:06:58good works does not get you into the kingdom of heaven. Good works does not get you into enter1:07:04the kingdom of heaven. I'm a good person and I've been very good and I believe I would go to heaven.1:07:12There are people out there that are good and they love their parents and they help a lot of people but they don't1:07:18believe in Jesus. They're not going to the kingdom of heaven. It's not about1:07:23being this per you know perfect person and helping many and you know it's about1:07:30accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior. Remember there was two person there was1:07:35Jesus on the cross and there were two more people on the cross. One of them was a murderer and the other one was a1:07:40thief. One of them repented and the other one mocked Jesus. So the person1:07:47that repented, Jesus looked at him and said, ""Today you will walk with me to1:07:53the kingdom of heaven."" And that man, that man, he committed a1:07:59lot of sin. He was a criminal. He was a criminal. That's why he was he on the1:08:04cross, too. He was a criminal. And he looked at Jesus and he said, ""I believe in you."" And Jesus said, ""Today you will1:08:12come with me to the kingdom of heaven."" So you could do all these good works.1:08:21You could do all these good works, but if you don't have Jesus, you're not going to go to the he uh to the kingdom of heaven. You're not going to the1:08:27kingdom of heaven. Scriptures is 100% accurate. Jesus is the only way. Period.1:08:34Period. All right. But uh according to some people, they just they don't want1:08:40to see it like that. Oh, again, you know, John 3:16 is the real deal. God is1:08:49so good, so good to me. Amen to that, Jen.1:08:57Go to your capital there on whatever Lewis and you and your wife try to get1:09:02the wall to change about your rooster. No. No, no, no, no. I can't. I can't.

1:09:08The fence wall. Yeah, they want like $6,500. No, I just spent almost $12,000

1:09:16replacing the entire roof. Uh the shingles, the plywood. I mean, there was

1:09:22like four plywoods that was really bad. And um everything was replaced. And uh

1:09:28yeah, that cost me an arm and a leg. So, because of the hurricane and uh we didn't went through FEMA. Everything was

1:09:34the insurance, but the insurance didn't pay much. So, I had to pull a lot more money from my pocket. So, uh I did get

1:09:41the roof done and uh uh yeah, I did so many repairs on this house, but uh if we

1:09:49get hit by another hurricane and this house sees another damage, uh1:09:54yeah, we're just going to move out of Florida cuz insurance is so expensive. these uh and car insurance and home

1:10:02insurance and property damage. I mean, it's just so much money. It just crazy.1:10:08So, um okay guys, I think I'm going to end it

1:10:13here. But but hey, thank you so much. This may shock some Christian, but not

1:10:18everybody wants to go to heaven. I don't know why. See guys, I want to  
1:10:25end it, but uh you know, I just love continue talking about Jesus. So, um

1:10:33I don't know why people just think like that. I look, I want to go to heaven. I  
1:10:38want to go to heaven. I want to enter that, you know, the kingdom of heaven.

1:10:46It's sad, you know. It's sad that people think like that, you know, I don't want Jesus. And then they, you know, they

1:10:52have this anger like every time you mention Jesus, they just get very angry. They get upset,

1:10:58you know. And uh Elon Musk, Elon said, Elon once said

1:11:04that he rather go to hell. Yes, Elon said that. Elon said, ""I rather go to

1:11:10hell because that's where most of the people are heading."" One thing I tell you, Elon is right. A1:11:16lot of people is going to go to hell. I got to be careful what I say in this platform because it go cuckoo. So, but  
1:11:23to a lot would go to the lake of fire and Jesus said, ""Oh man.""  
1:11:30Okay. I'm sorry guys. Give me a second here.

1:11:39Jesus said, ""The road to heaven is narrow.

1:11:44Not many will find it. the road to hell

1:11:49is straight. So what Jesus was saying there is that it's going to be hard for

1:11:55a you know a people to find the kingdom of heaven because a lot of people prefer  
1:12:01to living in this sinful world. They choose the sinful world. They

1:12:09choose the things of the world. Now remember what first John said. Those who

1:12:15love the things of the world, the love of the father is not in them. Those who

1:12:21love the things of the world, the love of the father is not in them. I mean, guys, don't get me wrong. I

1:12:27mean, you could enjoy life, you know, you could have a good time and, you know, you could have a mansion, you

1:12:34could have, you know, all these things. But when you put money over God, when you put materialistic over God, when you

1:12:41make that your God, then you chosen the things of the world. You cannot serve

1:12:48two masters. You cannot serve two masters.

1:12:54So I see, can't believe I mentioning their names.

1:12:59The Island Boys. I'm a island boy. you know, they show off their their jewelry  
1:13:05and money and it just I pray for them. I do. I pray

1:13:11that they repent. I mean, you got all these young again, you got all these young ones on these platform and they  
1:13:18make a lot of money. They make so much money. It's ridiculous. And uh they just

1:13:25they show off their money. They

1:13:30again it's just you know the Bible's accurate. Jesus is right. The road to heaven is narrow.

1:13:40Rooster are loud but their nature neighbors are louder. No. Well, here's the thing guys. The neighbors they love

1:13:47the chickens again. They love the rooster. They love it. They love the rooster. What's going on and I started

1:13:54noticing is that they're trying to get rid of us. When I say they, whoever they are, the

1:14:00county, whatever, we live in this nice, beautiful area, right?

1:14:05And you got these, you know, this is like off-grid stuff, you know? This is

1:14:10not under HOA. All right? This is just, you know, we live far away from the city

1:14:18and there's green grass all over the place. You don't see tall buildings here. But I started noticing

1:14:25that uh you have these I don't know who they are. I don't know the elites, whatever. They are buying all these

1:14:32lands. They really chop down the trees. They chop down everything. And I'm like, man, it used to be beautiful green trees

1:14:39here and now it's all like plain land. And they're going to build all these beautiful complex apartments.

1:14:46And they just built the college not too far from that.

1:14:52And it seems like this area here, they just want us to get out and they want to  
1:14:57buy all this area and build bigger houses because around the block, they just built these brand new houses, but

1:15:04when you come to my block, I mean, again, I have a nice house and everything, but uh they want to do the

1:15:12uh I wouldn't say smart city, but they want to rebuild all this, you know, make

1:15:18it brand new. So, I guess they're trying to push people out.

1:15:24And I did get a letter that they're willing to buy my house. And I'm like, I'm not selling my house. Get out of

1:15:30here. Um,

1:15:36okay guys, I'mma end it here. Thank you so much for tuning in. Yeah.

1:15:42Have a blessed blessed Sunday. Be safe out there. And uh I will keep you updated with

1:15:47these world news event that's related to Bible prophecy. Have a good night guys. Till next time

1mgsx84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empaths/comments/1mgsx84/sorry_this_is_so_long_but_has_anyone_else/,Sorry this is so LONG but has anyone else experienced feeling the feelings of those who are deceased?,"This is regarding death so if you're triggered by such, FYI. 

Also super long so get your coffee or tea and a comfy blanket. I just need to let it out because it's been one time too many and I know I'm not crazy... I mean, maybe I am whatever but these things happened. Let me start by saying I didn't know being empathic was even a thing but God bless the Internet, apparently I am and I'm not alone. I can feel how you're feeling literally.

Anywho, I'm thinking this extends to the other side. So my husband passed two weeks ago. My daughter and I were with him at the time. I laid beside him, put his arm around my shoulder and wept. It destroyed me... But all of a sudden, I felt pure joy. It wasn't MY joy - I was devastated. I sat up and was just enrolled in this warmth. I told my daughter Oh my God I can feel it - he's joyful! Like my heart was absolutely full of HIS happiness and HIS joy. Again it wasn't my feeling. I was and am so hurt but it was like his feelings just overlay  mine and I could clearly differentiate between the two. I did not see anything with my eyes but I could 'see' him greeting and being greeted by many others... It wasn't clear almost like if my mind was looking through a screen or a thin fabric; something greyish but it was just like he walked into a place or a room with people waiting for him. There was welcome and joy, and Hey! How are you and hugging but it wasn't actual hugging. I don't know how else to explain it but it's been in my mind ever since which is why I'm here.

I've experienced three prior incidents where I could swear someone communicated to me after they were deceased. 

1) My mother when she passed - she was furious with me because I was angry at my sister's for how they treated her before she passed. After her memorial, I lay in bed thinking of ways I could get back at them.... And suddenly I just felt her rage like she was in front of me, a huge red rage. I remember not being scared because I knew exactly who and what it was. Rather, I said ""Okay Mom, okay fine. I'll leave them alone"". I was still pissed but she said leave them alone so I did. That was it she was gone. I didn't SEE her but I don't know, I did - and she was RED but it wasn't actually her physically - but she was right there. 

2) A coworker. We weren't close close, but we were cool - we laughed and shot the shit, so you know; not quite work husband but he was That Guy (TG). He unexpectedly passed from a heart attack like at 40 something. His wife was at a loss and since he was pretty popular at work, I asked her permission to share. She said only with his friends. So I sent the info of his passing and other comms like his arrangements and so on to the people he invited on his baby shower email. His service was beautiful, the whole crew showed their respects, checked in his wife, etc. The evening of his services, I was home and laying on my couch... And as plain as day, TG said ""Thank you"", and left - but it wasn't with words. Still, I knew exactly what he was saying and as quick as he was there, he was gone. Didn't see him, didn't hear him but it was him. Again it was a feeling as if he were right there in front of me. I said you're welcome. And that was it. Nothing else.

3) I dreamed a tall man was looking for someone. Like he wanted me to tell someone something or... SOMETHING, I didn't know. Anywho, he got frustrated and left. That was it. I remember thinking that it was a dream but it sure felt real, again, didn't see or hear him. And I wasn't scared. No actual words... But he was there. I've gone over it many times in my head since then and I think it was the father of a good friend of mine. He passed away a couple months before. He wanted me to tell her something but at the time I didn't know who he was talking about. I talk to her so the time but I've never told her ""Yeah so hey, I think your dad visited me...""

When my husband passed that joy took away my fear of passing. Like I KNOW there is something after this. I'm still devastated and alternate between anger and sadness about his passing and yes, I know it's selfish, but don't care. I love and miss him. But I also know that he was absolutely joyful when he left. It has eased the pain of losing him in the sense that when we leave this body, it is not the end.

There is no way this is just me, or my imagination.n yes I thought maybe it was all just intended dreaming but no, I was wide awake this time. I came here looking for answers because I am certain I am not alone. Maybe others have. I don't know, just curious I guess.",1,1754251290.0,Empaths,0,1.0,False
1mgswt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mgswt8/passed_over_for_promotion_for_not_being_visible/,"Passed over for promotion for not being “visible”, how can I improve?","
Hi all,
Would love to see your advice on how to be more visible at work and what it means exactly. 

I’m a high performing senior specialist and had good feedback from colleagues and my manager during my performance reviews. My manager has been promoting me as ready for the next step for a year or so now. Recently we had a manager position open in my department but they went with another manager from another department wanting to switch over to our side instead of promoting me. The hiring manager was the associate director who’s just been promoted herself, so she doesn’t know me well, and she said she knew of me but never actually had a conversation with me and she had the impression that I don’t like to mingle with people or show myself enough. 

It is true that I mostly hang out with my own “work friends” or my teammates. And I don’t kiss higher management’s ass. But I’m polite and always smile, say hello, how are you, If I come across people in the coffee area etc.

I work in a team with a lot of stakeholder management and I am in contact with a lot of departments which have always praised my teamwork and open and positive personality. 

I prefer to work from home and keep to myself. I don’t boast about my accomplishments although I perform my work with a high standard. I’m not extroverted or introverted, something in between. It takes me a while to open up, but once I do, I am very relaxed and people trust me and come to me for advice etc. 

I’m a 31 year old woman looking a lot younger than her age, and I’m starting to think it’s hindering my career growth as people assume I don’t have experience by looking at me at first glance whereas I’m one of the most experienced people in my team as we work in a niche area.

1mgswqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1mgswqj/bladder_pressurepain/,Bladder pressure/pain,"I will try to keep this short. 

I am a menopausal woman, 54 years old. 

12 years ago, I started having bladder pain and pressure. I had a hydrodistension and cystoscopy which showed that I had some redness indicative of Interstitial Cystitis (IC). No Hunter’s ulcers though. 

Through the last 12 years, I have tried so many things. My “flares” generally lasted 1-3 months then somehow just disappeared. The diet doesn’t seem to make a difference except for coffee does make me void much more during a flare, so I don’t drink it then. 

2.5 years ago, I had a terribly painful flare and decided to try pelvic PT. It was so tight that she couldn’t hardly do a thing the first few visits. Let’s just say pelvic PT was life changing for me. I have a wand at home that I use when I feel a flare. It helps but nothing like pelvic PT. 

I have always exercised and mainly enjoy lifting weights. Three years ago I increased how heavy I lift and incorporated RDLs, and different kinds of heavier squatting. That’s when the first really bad flare hit. 

I went back to heavy lifting after I recovered, relying on my breathing and form but low and behold, I must’ve done it again. I was doing very light squats and RDLs but that’s what I assume is causing this problem again. I also went through an extremely stressful couple weeks. 

I just “graduated” from pelvic PT in June. And now I feel like I need it again! I’ve been using my wand and find a lot of tightness/pain  deeper inside. My main symptom is bladder pressure and pain. I can’t hold it for 30 min or the pain gets pretty bad. Strangely enough, I sleep all night with one bathroom trip. 

I have since learned that any bladder can look red and angry when it is distended with water. Since diet doesn’t affect me, I am really beginning to think I have a pelvic floor problem, not a bladder problem. 

Anyone else here feel like your bladder is mainly affected? Were you diagnosed with IC?

I am so upset that I’m back in pain again. I do find that Flexeril, tramadol and amitriptyline help me. As does Klonopin but I don’t take that much. 

I love lifting weights. It makes me feel so much stronger. I finally found exercising fun. And now I can’t do anything again. 

I have no idea if my bladder is causing my tight pelvic floor or the other way around!",1,1754251259.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False
1mgsw1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mgsw1c/does_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_deluxe_coffee_maker/,Does the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee Maker Review Exceed Expectations?,"The Nespresso BNV125TTN1BUC1 Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker quickly became a household staple for me. As a coffee enthusiast, the variety it offers, combined with its sleek design, caught my attention almost immediately. There’s something magical about the simplicity of pressing a button and being greeted with a velvety cup of coffee or espresso. The compact, titan metallic exterior fits snugly into my countertop setup, proving that small appliances can pack a punch. But hold onto your mugs—there’s a little more to unpack here.

**Design and Compact Ease**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing the coffee maker was its sharp, metallic finish. It’s like an espresso machine and a tiny sculpture had a baby! While the ""14-inch by 8.6-inch by 10.4-inch"" dimensions make it compact enough to slide into tighter spaces, it doesn’t skimp on user-friendliness. The 37-ounce removable side water tank is not just easy to fill, but it can be repositioned for convenience. Toss in an adjustable drip tray, and you’ve got a machine that accommodates anything from a petite espresso cup to a large mug for those marathon work mornings. 

**Ease of Operation**  
Let’s talk about the one-touch brewing system—which I might be slightly obsessed with. The button-centered interface is foolproof. Seriously, I think my cat could figure this out (though I’m keeping her on decaf). From heating up in under 30 seconds to automatically ejecting used coffee pods, this appliance transforms your morning ritual into a moment of zen. However, I will admit that its pod exclusivity does lock you into the Nespresso Vertuo capsule ecosystem. While those capsules come in over 40 varieties, availability might vary depending on where you live.  

[Check Nespresso BNV125TTN1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c5zp4tx7/)

**Perks**  
- Five brewing sizes, ranging from espressos to larger hot or iced coffee servings.  
- Nespresso's aluminum pods are recyclable, making this machine environmentally considerate.  
- The included tasting pack lets you sample their coffee lineup, which for me felt like rummaging through a box of chocolate—it was hard to pick a favorite!  

**Drawbacks**  
- The reliance on exclusive capsules might be inconvenient and pricier compared to other machines with open pod compatibility.  
- The unit isn’t the lightest at over 8 pounds, making it less ideal for those wanting a portable option for events or vacations.  

**Coffee Quality**  
Each cup brewed with this machine comes topped with a generous layer of crema. It’s not just coffee; it’s an art piece you get to drink. I haven’t encountered a single weak or watery cup yet. The precision brewing feature practically guarantees consistency. It's especially appealing for those of us picky folks who treat coffee like liquid gold.

**Challengers in the Coffee Game**  
During my testing spree, I pitted this machine against the Keurig K-Elite and Breville Bambino Plus. While the Keurig’s multi-brand coffee pod compatibility adds an edge in convenience, it falls short when it comes to flavor depth. The Breville Bambino Plus, on the other hand, delivers exceptional espresso shots but requires far more skill and cleanup. The Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe seems to strike a balance, excelling as a low-effort yet high-reward solution for both coffee and espresso.

**True Value**  
Considering the design, coffee quality, and simplicity, this appliance holds its ground in terms of cost-efficiency. If you’re someone who spends a hefty amount getting your daily fix at a café, this machine makes its price worth every shot. Better still, its modern metallic finish ensures that it holds style points in the kitchen, which some budget machines sorely lack.

1mgsvzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1mgsvzq/the_ashes_of_my_mind/,The Ashes of My Mind...,"There has been a tussle between my heart & mind. Well, it is quite obvious; since my mind has always been dominating my heart, and making my soul wander. Lonely, I have been feeling nothing but a lack of motivation to pen down most of my time, and I am trying hard to go through my old journals and letters that have been somewhere between myself and others. At those poetry and verses that have been part of me, are lost somewhere in this jiggle of my heart and mind. I am losing myself to this cruel world, and I don't know what to do about it.

​Will I be that blooming Courtyard of my past, which has seen the thunder, and yet maintained itself quite elegantly? Writing has always kept me alive, and this silent void through my fingers wants to crawl all over the words and splash the ink on the earth, and then I would find myself back with all passion and cravings to make this world listen to my unheard scriptures. The void through my finger had started making my veins blow, as if it was suffocating the slow death in a funnel. I won't call it solitude, but the pain that has kept my fingers crying for months.

​No, this is not my journal, to be very honest, but my stomach feeling all those butterflies a few times during midnight is making me go insane. Those sleepless nights without writing a word had felt like a cage! Where I can see the world, though very restricted, where you don't exist for the word. The ink on my bookshelf has been digitized, while waiting for me to splash those ink on the canvas again. To splash those colors of scars on the canvas again. Should I find pain to color my canvas, or let my heart bleed, pour that color on the mural? Is it really these emotions that make someone write the pages? What exactly gives the so-called eagerness to pen down?

The ashes of my mind, engraved on your wall, would you mind reading a word from my sheet?
Have I told you lately that those colors on my wallpaper, are left of my flashback, which have taken from my heart.

Am I being cheesy, oh c'mon, I won't mind, will you come over tonight, all fine like wine?
Can we stay under the moon, listening to our blend?

Do you add music in it, would you mind to make the list?
Let's take a walk down the valley as well, we will stay barefoot on the grass, with the essence of you.

I don't want this poetry to end like your breath, as calm as those cold breezes near the sea at night.
I want to go on, let us lose our sheath, I want you to laugh in between that moment - a moment that brings out the overwhelm to its peace.
Your eyes bring out shine to my soul, I want to stay till you feel the need to hold my hand across the valley.

​These lines have taken me back to the time when I was in solitude, reading books, and lighting a cigarette on my balcony. You see, words could be made arranged in a line to make any sentence that could make sense. But I didn't find the same connection there as I did before. Will I survive without those poetry, those journals, and my canvas? I would love to live in a cottage, which would be abandoned in between the mountains, with my dog. I would love to sip tea from the tea kettle and pluck each leaf delicately. I would drive miles to bring wines and cigarettes for myself. I would read Bukowski, Roy, Vikram Seth, and Premchand in the evening, with my tea or coffee, lighting a cigarette.

    It crept in anyway.
    A shimmer of gold, like it knew I was ready.

    through the hush of silence that had wrapped me for weeks.

    Deeper. 
    More mine. 
    
    And for the first time in a long while,

    I just was. 
    Still. Soft. Awake. 
    
    I sat with the light. 
    Let it trace my soul, 
    dance along the tops of my fingers,
    like it remembered me. 
    
    And I remembered me too. 
    Not all at once, 
    but in flashes. 
    A favorite song. 
    The way coffee smells when it’s brewing
    The urge to pick up a pen
    
    I didn’t need to be whole.
    I just needed to be here.
    And I was.

1mgsthk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgsthk,[Before&After] Update on clearing acne + PIE,"After struggling with acne for ~10 years, I think I've finally figured out how to clear it for good, along with figuring out my skincare routine for PIE. 

First, nothing skincare related made significant progress on my acne! It is only useful for my PIE. For acne itself, I will talk about some things that might be better to discuss with a professional. Please don't immediately jump to taking supplements. I did extensive research by myself throughout my journey, but I also want everyone to be safe! It was also difficult to identify exactly my internal issues because I was scared the doctors would think I was crazy for wanting my insulin or blood sugars tested when I didn't have PCOS or other signs of insulin resistance/diabetes.

//CLEARING MY ACNE//

My main issue for acne really was my diet, which wasn't even that awful to begin with. My biggest aggravators were carbs, dairy, and coffee. Before I identified that, my diet would look like a cup of cooked rice for lunch and dinner along with stir fried veggies + some meat. If I had time for breakfast, it would look like eggs and some granola. It looks healthy and it probably is a healthy diet, but I believe my body had an insulin issue where it overproduces insulin in response to sugar entering my body. I'm not a professional, but I believe my elevated insulin triggered IGF-1 production, which promotes sebocyte (sebum cell) and keratinocyte (protein cell) proliferation. Dairy also contributes to a similar pathway, and I also have a bit of lactose intolerance. 

At first, I went on a strict diet and found that sticking to under 20g of net carbs a day was a safe limit to avoid breakouts. But I don't really recommend this because I noticed many symptoms and issues with my period cause of it, despite my clear skin. I thought I figured it out, but I was still unsatisfied because this diet was so restrictive and unhealthy. This led me to ask my dermatologist to go on accutane so I could eat normally. My skin in a previous post is me on accutane. However, my acne would come back a few months later and got deeper each month. I went on it twice, and it didn't solve my issue. But I found another solution recently!

Because I was so certain my body couldn't handle carbs correctly, I started taking a supplement (Berberine) that improves insulin sensitivity with any meal of the day once a day. It worked wonders for me. I could finally eat like a normal person (not a bunch of sugar, but being able to have complex carbs and fruit) and not breakout. But I say this with caution because this is my story and I was very certain I had insulin problems unlike other healthy people. It might be better to just cut down on ultra-processed carbs/sugar and see how that helps you!! Natural does not mean it won't harm you so please be safe and discuss with your doctor! This is what works for me, and has the least side effects, allowed me to get my period back, and greatly improved my quality of life.

I also believe I had estrogen dominance, which I had no visible symptoms of. However, I started taking DIM supplement 200mg a day, and it also helped my acne in addition to regulating my insulin. I couldn't slack on both. However, I haven't tried not taking it while on my new supplement. I think this supplement is less risky on your health than Berberine too.

//SKINCARE FOR PIE//

At night, I double cleanse with unscented dove bar soap, apply hyaluronic acid serum, apply Paula's Choice azelaic acid, and moisturize with La Roche Posay cicablast b5. In the morning, I cleanse once with cerave salicylic acid cleanser, apply hyaluronic acid serum, purito oat moisturizer, and biore sunscreen. 

I would pay more attention to my night routine, as my morning one is more for a good makeup base. I know the PC azelaic acid is pricey but it's the best azelaic acid I've used, likely due to the other helpful ingredients. The cicablast b5 moisturizer is also amazing for calming my redness down, and my mom asks if I'm wearing makeup when I wake up before removing it and getting ready!

Time is also just really the main part. Skincare can help speed it up but it wasn't until 2 years that my PIE cleared completely. The PIE you see in my after are more recent breakouts when I wouldn't eat properly.

I recently moved to Cork and just wanted to check if this is common here. Is it normal for drivers to cut lanes on the R610?

Today, a woman in an SUV suddenly swerved from the right lane (marked in pink) into my lane (green) without indicating. When I honked, she gave me the finger.

Just wondering—does this kind of driving happen often here?

    It was a sudden moment. 
    A great awakening. 
    On a morning where the weight didn't sit quite as heavy on my chest. 
    
    The darkness consumed me,
    But the light—
    It crept in anyway.
    A shimmer of gold, like it knew I was ready.
    
    It didn’t ask for permission. 
    It just came. 
    Through the cracks in the blinds, 
    through the hush of silence that had wrapped me for weeks. 
    
    My breath felt new. 
    Deeper. 
    More mine. 
    
    And for the first time in a long while, 
    I didn’t feel like I had to perform strength. 
    I just was. 
    Still. Soft. Awake. 
    
    I sat with the light. 
    Let it trace my soul, 
    dance along the tops of my fingers,
    like it remembered me. 
    
    And I remembered me too. 
    Not all at once, 
    but in flashes. 
    A favorite song. 
    The way coffee smells when it’s brewing
    The urge to pick up a pen
    
    I didn’t need to be whole.
    I just needed to be here.
    And I was.
    
    The light had returned.
    And so had I.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency many thanks. Please be aged between 25 and 32 thank you 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1mgsrpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1mgsrpd/a_list_of_reasons_why_i_quit/,A List of Reasons Why I Quit,"For context, I worked for a franchise at one stand before transferring to another, I held the barista title for two years and shift lead title for one. I was very well regarded as a hard worker who was very respectful, reliable, and had excellent customer service skills. So buckle up, because I say what I mean and mean what I say:

- The Pay: I can recognize and be grateful that dutch's starting pay is much higher than other food service jobs. However, it is far from proportionally appropriate for what is expected out of the positions. For what's barely enough to cover rent in most places, you are met with a laundry list of responsibilities that aren't even always in the job description. This is might not be a big of a deal if in my state, we weren't scheduled for 6-8 hours shifts with no breaks. 

- The most drama filled workplace you'll ever find: Never a moment of peace, I swear. Both stands were filled to the brim with mean girls and lazy a**holes. Anybody worth being friends with never lasted long because the air was so toxic, it wasn't worth sacrificing mental and emotional health. I did manage to find a couple of people I was able to get along well with, but every single one of has left and feel a thousand times better for it. 

- Little to no conflict management: From my experience, the managers all do a really damn good job of convincing you that they are there for you, and that they are always someone you can talk to or bring concerns to. But when it comes to practicing what they preach? Suddenly, that same care magically disappears as they're more afraid of looking bad front of the higher ups than they are of beating the roots of the problems.

- Overtolerance for intolerance: We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who is disrespectful towards our staff...unless it's towards a brown employee, apparently. I'm a POC in a red state, and let me tell you that I have heard and received some of the filthiest things you could possibly imagine from people. I've been spat on, called slurs, had stuff thrown at me, etc. Forget trying to report these incidents to anyone, they would shrug and thank me for being willing to deal with it. I wasn't willing to deal with it. But if I argued, guess who was getting written up for Tone & Delivery. This guy.

- Inappropriate Work Place Relationships: I have plenty of stories, but considering they are stories FAMOUSLY known by EVERYONE in the franchise, sharing them would be too identifying.

I sincerely loved the job of making coffee and interacting with people. It was fun, and I really enjoyed it when I first started. But the only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I was a full-time student and needed something part-time. I still debate if it was even worth it to this day. I had a miserable time.

I'm an open book about my experience, so if anyone is more curious about the realities of working at Dutch (As a college student, in a red state, as a franchise, etc) feel free to ask questions",2,1754250919.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

0:002025. It is approximately 11 p.m. Eastern0:05time. We have an urgent breaking news. Um,0:10uh, the ground in New York and New Jersey, uh, has been shaken for the last0:1645 minutes. For the past 45 minutes.0:22Okay, guys. Can you hear me or see me? Let me know.0:29Can you guys see me and hear me?0:34Is it good now? Okay, perfect. I don't know why YouTube0:40does that whenever is a big breaking news. It just they really mess with my live stream. Okay, so again guys, for0:46those of you that just tuned in, all right, there's been uh a very very powerful earthquake, a three a 3.0, but0:54you have some other are saying it's a 3.6. So again, uh I think the number is1:00at 3.0 magnitude, but this thing was felt in New York, it was felt in1:06Manhattan, and I think it was felt in the Bronx too and New Jersey. So they are saying that this uh this could be1:13connected to uh the earthquake that struck Russia, the 8.8 magnitude1:20earthquake. All right. And yesterday, I did post a video yesterday that earthquake was felt in New York. All1:27right. The shock wave from that 8.8 has made it towards the east coast. All right. So, a 3.6 magnitude earthquake1:34struck the greater New York area in New Jersey Saturday local time days after a1:40powerful earthquake rattled Russia's far east. Now, it says here1:46an earthquake measuring 3.6 magnitude earthquake in New York City and New Jersey late Saturday1:53local time. This comes just two days after a magnitude 4.4 earthquake in1:59Southern California with tremors reported in Los Angeles and three days2:04later, excuse me, and 3 days after the deadly 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck2:11Russia's far east, triggering tsunami warning. I believe what's going on right now, I believe is connected to that 8.82:19magnitude earthquake. And I do believe there's going to be a lot more earthquake that's going to shake2:25America. I believe that there's going to be a lot more powerful earthquakes.2:31Mexico got hit too, by the way. Mexico got hit with a 6.0. All right. So,2:37there's been some earthquake going on in Southern California and we got one in New York and New2:43Jersey.

All3:04right so again let me show you some of this other stuff here.3:11All right so you have walls alert. So they got it at a 3.0 magnitude earthquake. So a 3.0 magnitude3:18earthquake was recorded moments ago near the New York area, New York City3:25area with the epicenter near Oakland, New Jersey. Numerous people reported3:32filling the ground shaking with reports flooding in from Manhattan to the Bronx.3:39Are you serious?3:46You know guys, ever since ever since Donald3:51went to the UK and they are talking about possibly splitting the Holy Land,3:57Israel, splitting the Holy Land, a two-state solution this coming September4:03along with uh I think there's a blood moon that also is going to appear. It seems like God is sending a message to4:11the sleeping giant. Be careful what you do with the Holy Land. Splitting the4:16Holy Land. So, we are definitely seeing some kind of signs of Bible prophecy.4:22Um, so here's some more news coming out.4:32Okay guys, I'm back. I'm back. This is going to be like an in-n-out thing when4:37it comes to I don't know if it's the platform that's trying to shut it down, but uh uh this is a4:44I'm sorry about it, guys. My connection is good. I think it's the platform that might be trying to shut it down. A 3.04:50occurred 11 miles northwest of New York City,4:577 minutes local time. And5:03here's a picture5:1718 miles northwest of Manhattan, New York. 4 minutes ago, local time 221852.5:27The colored dots represent local staking and damage.5:33Are there damage reported? Hold on. So, uh, hold on. So, 4 minutes ago, local5:38time 221852 color dots represent local shaking and5:45damage level reported by eyewitnesses.5:50Say your experience. All6:10right. So, it happened right there, guys.6:29All right, give me a second here. Also, we have some more breaking news about those nuclear submarines. We're going to6:36get to that, too, guys. We're going to get to the nuclear submarines. Uh, Russia has been putting out these6:41message that uh, you know, if there's ever a nuclear war, they're not going to6:46hit like big cities like New York or you know, going after DC. They're going to be hitting the power grid. They're going6:53to be hitting like the farm land. They're going to be hitting like those regions and military bases. All right.6:59So, that's some serious stuff there. We're going to get to that news. All right. So,7:06Okay. So, a lot of people is reporting this7:14earthquake7:19by residents. flood in from Manhattan to Bronx and reports filling.7:26Now look guys, for those of you, hey, for those of you that live in New Jersey, I lived in New Jersey. I lived7:32like in the northern part. I lived up there in Jersey City and Patterson, New Jersey. So, and again, that's not too7:38far from New York. Um, you don't want to see earthquake in that7:44region. You do not want to see earthquake in New York. I don't care if it's a 3.0. You do not want to see those7:51earthquake happening in time square or 42nd street or you know those region.7:58You do not want to see those uh those ground movements. And the reason why guys New York is not8:04like California. California is well prepared. You know again a lot of their buildings could stand 7 plus magnitude.8:12New York if they get hit with a 6.0 Oh, some of those buildings are just going8:17to go like this and possibly tilt. So again, the Big Apple, those earthquake8:25is is pretty rare. All right, so it's not like California in the Pacific Ring8:30of Fire. All right, so some people think that 3.0 is nothing.8:36Uh for New York, it is something. So for New York City, it is something. Right.8:43So,8:51are those amp to shock? Look at this.8:57No. Are you s Hold on. Give me a second here. Breaking news. Earthquake rattles9:04outside New York City. A magnitude 3.0 earthquake hits near9:11pass height, New Jersey, shaking the area just outside New York City.9:17Residents reporting Philly the tremor, but so far no damage has been reported, which is a good thing.9:24But you see that yellow dot, that's the earthquake. And I'm trying to9:30figure out what is the uh the gray dots. Hopefully those ain't aftershock. But uh9:37yeah, I'm going to have to do some more research on this one here, guys. Um,9:44wow. These are amazing times of Bible prophecy. We are definitely seeing the9:50ground shaking. If you are in Jesus Christ, if you have Jesus, you know what time it is. Let the ground shake.9:59Let the ground shake.10:07Okay, so we have some more breaking news.10:17Reports of light shaking around New York, New Jersey, and can no following10:22magnitude 3 magnitude at 10:18 p.m. Eastern time. The epicenter was in Hasbro Heights in New Jersey. So, this10:30thing was sp all the way up to to uh Connecticut.10:44Wow.10:49Guys, if you can give this video a thumbs up, I really appreciate it. Thank you again for your support.10:57Here's another one.11:14reports of flooding in. What in the world is going on beneath11:20New York City? Nothing. It's just an earthquake.11:26Uh, but I do believe that uh there's a lot of stuff going on with uh with these11:32wars. There's a lot of stuff going on with uh the Holy Land Israel. There's a lot of stuff going on and this uh a11:39lunar eclipse I think coming this September. At the same time, 14411:44countries are coming together to recognize the Palestinian. You know what? Uh as a again as a state. All11:52right. So, there's going to be a lot of stuff to come, guys. A lot of things are going to11:58come. All right. So, I'm looking for some more12:03information here. So, a small earthquake has made the east12:09coast tremble in fear.12:17Wow. Okay.12:31A magnitude 3.0 earthquake rattle parts of northern New Jersey on Saturday night12:36with tremor felt across the region including New York City. According to the USGS,12:45the earthquake struck at approximately 10:22 p.m. and was center in Hbrook12:51Heights, Bergen County. I used to live in Bergen County.12:57See if I could call some of my friends and see if they're doing good up there. The USGS reported the epicenter as zip13:04kilometers yikes northeast of the town, indicating a shallow event likely13:11responsible for the widespread sessation of the shaking.13:18Residents in multiple counties including Jersey City, Bergen, Morris, and Essex13:25said they felt a tremor, as did people in Harrison and East Orange. I used to13:33work at East Orange. I used to uh I think that's right next to uh Irvington13:38and Elizabeth, New Jersey. The shaking extended beyond New Jersey with reports13:43of movements coming in from parts of New York City and even as far as Westchester13:50and Rockland counties in upstate New York. New York City residents also13:56reported hearing a boom along the vibration. Whoa, there was a boom sound.14:03New York City residents also reported hearing a boom sound along with the14:10vibration. Despite the surprise, no injuries or property damage have been reported as of14:16Saturday night. So, someone Well, you got some people14:22out there that's uh saying that14:30you got some people out there in New York City and um Jersey City and New Jersey uh reporting hearing a boom sound14:39along with a vibration. All right. So,14:46I know a lot of people up there, they're not used to earthquakes, man. Um, be14:51safe out there. Uh, to the brick city.15:02All right. So, even Mexico got hit. Mexico got hit with15:08a 6.0. It was downgraded to a 5.8. But man,15:13what's going on here, guys? There's been a lot of earthquake happening and Donald has deployed nuclear submarines and it's15:21it's closing in. Donald said the nuclear subs are closing in and those nuclear15:27subs are carrying the Trident 2 nuclear warheads. I mean, this is some serious15:33stuff we are uh witnessing um right now. So, Pix 11, that's uh the15:40New York uh news media. Pix 11 News has received multiple calls15:48from viewers in Bloomfield, New Jersey, Westchester, New York, and Queens15:56reporting that they felt their beds and television shaking. The earthquake was16:02triggered. Excuse me. The earthquake was registered at around 10:18 p.m.16:08according to the USGS. Wow. So again, this thing was felt way up there also in16:15Connecticut. All right, give me a second here, guys.16:30I want to take you to the USGS earthquake map. All right, here's the USGS. All right, let me just16:38Okay, here we go. Okay, you see that? That's Russia. All16:45right, they still getting hit ever since that 8.8 magnitude earthquake. They16:50still getting hit. That's a lot of earthquake. And the biggest one today was a 6.0. All right, so let me zoom it16:56out now. Let's go to this side. Ooh. Ooh. That's America.17:05Jeez. Southern California. You guys are getting hit.17:11Wow. Cascadia. Oh,17:19New York.17:28Wow.17:40All right. So, it seems like ever since that 8.8 right there,17:46Jeez, Russia is getting hit so bad. All right. So, according to some experts,17:52they're saying that Russia is going to be fitting the ground movement for weeks or possibly months. All right.17:59But it seems like ever since that earthquake, it triggered18:05America. It just really trigger America. America is like not in a good spot.18:14You got the West Coast and the East Coast getting hit.18:20Wow.18:26amazing times of Bible prophecy and there will be nation against nation18:32and kingdom against kingdom. You know, Donald said that he call himself the18:37peacemaker and he's and he said the reason why he's deploying the nuclear submarines, he18:44wants safety for the American people. So he call himself a peacekeeper and he18:51deploys nuclear submarines for safety. But when spoken of peace and safety,18:59then sudden destruction shall follow. All right.19:05All right. Give me a second here, guys. I want to show you something else here.19:10I'm waiting for some more updates. All right. So, we're going to go with this next news here about the nuclear19:17submarine. And then, uh, again, I'm just waiting for more updates about the New York earthquake. But, uh, I want to show19:23you something here.19:30\[Music\] Okay. So19:46Marjorie Taylor Green warns that the US president that support for K is complete19:52betrayal as Americans want no wars. So Marjorie Taylor Green is saying that20:00in 2024 US the American voted to end funding and fighting foreign wars. That's that's20:08true. Funding fueling and ultimately fighting the bear in Ukraine will be a20:13complete betrayal to the majority of the Americans who want nothing to do with playing to pay to take out innocent.20:24All right. So Marjorie Taylor Green, she's coming out and speaking the truth.20:30She's uh she's basically calling out Donald and I noticed that she's uh she's20:35really departing away from Donald. Uh she said that Donald Bill, the digital20:41currency is the mark of the beast. And now she's saying that Donald is20:46betraying us. And I got to say this, she's absolutely20:52right. She's absolutely right. And the reason why is because Donald is going to take us to WW3. He's going to drag us20:58into something really huge here, guys. All right. Again, deploying two nuclear subs is not a good thing. All right. And21:06um you know, again, I do believe something big is about to snap pretty soon.21:12Something big is going to snap pretty soon.21:18All right. So, the countdown begins. All right. Hopefully hopefully uh Donald21:23does not give the green light to fire some nuclear. But uh yeah um Donald said21:30that he was not going to drag us into this war. Yeah. Well,21:367 months later we are being dragged into this biblical war. Oh guys, it seems21:41like it's a 3.6 if I'm not mistaken.21:52A 3.6 magnitude earthquake struck the New York City area and parts of New Jersey.21:59All right. So again, I mean, you got different magnitudes here. You got a 3.6 and then you got a22:053.0. Um, let me go to the USGS and see where the magnitude is at. Uh, right now22:13the magnitude for New York22:34Jeez.22:42Okay, here we go.22:49So, it's not a 3.6. It's not a 3.6. It's a 3.0. Okay. And it was 10 km deep. All22:59right. So that's the depth. 10 kilometers 3.0. And it struck northeast23:06of Hasbro Heights in New Jersey. It was felt in certain parts in New York City.23:14Some people are saying it was felt in Connecticut. That's some serious stuff there. If it was felt all the way in23:19Connecticut, man, it just not good.23:25Look, I prayed that this is the only earthquake. I prayed that this is one, but again, I did I had a strong feeling23:32I had a strong feeling that there was going to be an earthquake in uh in New York.23:42Give me a second here, guys.23:56I'm seeing if I can find any more updates here.24:07If you can, please share the video. Give this video a big thumbs up. I really appreciate it.24:14Um,24:19so look at this here, guys. Look at this.24:26So this is my video. It was posted a day ago. Mega Craig felt in New York. All24:32right. And I made that video yesterday. All right. And I kind of had a feeling24:38that New York was going to get hit or New York or New Jersey was going to get hit.24:50Um,25:08it seems like everything just fired down. Um, I'm not seeing any more uh25:13news about the earthquake. which is a good thing.25:26Yeah, it seems like this is all of it here, guys. So, the Empire State Building, hold on. Empire State Building25:34on X. Um, after 3.0 magnitude earthquake25:40strike New York City. Give me a second here. Oh, okay. Um, hold on.25:51Empire State Building said I am fine. All right. So,25:58I thought there was something wrong with the anti I mean Empire State Building, but I guess they just uh letting everybody know the Empire State Building26:05is good. It's fine for now.26:11For now. Because I do believe one day the entire I mean that that reads in the big apple26:18eventually everything will come down pretty soon in the end times of Bible26:23prophecy everything will come down.26:28Um26:36okay so it seems like that's all of it for now guys. Hopefully, like I said, this is the only earthquake. Um,26:46and it's a 3.0, 10 kilometers, no injuries, there's no damage. Um,26:54everything is good.27:05Okay, guys. So, I want to talk more about the27:11nuclear subs. All right. So, I posted a video earlier today that um27:19you got the uh the Russians, if they ever go to a biblical nuclear27:25war against us, they're not going to be hitting like big cities and stuff like that. They're going to go after like the27:32silo like the Minaman 3 silo in Wyoming or Montana. They're going to go after27:37those stuff. They're going to go after the power grid and they're going to go after the farmland. And the reason why27:43the farmland because again that's that's our food. That's like uh again that's also also big money making machine uh27:52food stuff. So you have the former leader Dimmitri is27:57also putting out his message that's very concerning.28:09The bare terrifying dead hand warning as spiraling nuclear rhetoric28:15leaves world on a brick. So you have some of these countries they're very concerned. Some of these countries they28:23they are urging Russia and the US to like knock it off. So uh and hey28:31I agree with them. I mean we don't want to see any nuclear war going on here. So you have Vladimir security chief issued28:38a chilling warning about the bare dead hand nuclear capability as he spared with28:45Donald in an increasingly tense war of words.28:54Dimmitri, who serves on the country's security council, said that the US commander-in-chief should recall his29:01favorite movies about The Walking Dead and remember how dangerous the so-called29:06dead hand could be. All right, so I'm not going to29:14talk too much about that because I did post so many videos of it. So he's basically telling Donald that uh you29:22need to remember one thing. If you take us out, if you take Putin, if you take29:28all of us out, there is a dead man switch that's going to be activated,29:34which which means that uh it's programmed uh the computer or the AI is29:40going to launch all nuclear warheads worldwide. So that's what the dead man29:47switch means. Um, I want to show you this one here really quick, guys.29:54Um, give me a second here.30:00So, I was watching this piece this person video right here and this is30:07very powerful, right? So, I want to read this part really quick. War in Europe is coming. George, a30:14former UK Labor MP, adds it will go nuclear and the living30:22shall envy the dead. Says better to perish in first blast30:30than be a zombie dying slowly in algony. I don't know what that means, but uh30:36this person is absolutely right. He's absolutely right. A lot of people's30:41going to wish to be gone or to, you know, to be dead.30:48If you survive a nuclear war, you're going to envy the dead.30:54You're going to envy the dead. You're going to wish that you were in front of30:59the blast or in front of the mushroom cloud. Because if you survive,31:05the world is no longer going to be the same. The water is going to be bitter. It's going to be warmwood. It's going to31:11be poison. no no food and the sun will be blocked and it's going to rain acid31:17or radiation. It it just the air is going to be impacted. And so the living,31:23those who survive, they're going to envy the dead.31:29They're going to envy the dead and say, ""Man, I wish I wish I was in front of31:34the blast."" You can again the Bible says that many31:40many people will run into caves. Many people will run into caves.31:48And the Bible also said that many people will seek death but death will not find31:54them. Okay, that's that's some serious stuff there. That's kind of similar to31:59what this guy said that the living will envy the dead. So again, I see a lot of32:05people building bunkers. I see a lot of people, you know, storing up food in their bunkers and getting all this32:12ready. You got Mark Zuckerberg, he had his bunker. You got all these like elites. Uh they got their underground32:20$21 trillion bunkers or underground city, whatever you want to call it. But32:26all these people are well prepared. And when things hit the fan,32:31when Defcon goes to one and they start pushing Nuke buttons, everybody's going32:36to run to the cave or to the mountain like the Bible says. It's a metaphor.32:42People's going to run to their bunkers. And32:47you know, it's not going to be the same world once, you know, the war ends and they stay underground for like a short32:54period of time until the air clears out clears out the radiation. Once they get32:59out, it's going to be a different world.33:04It's not going to be the same. It's going to mess with you.33:11is going to mess with you spiritually, physically, and mentally. It's going to33:16mess with you. It's, you know, and33:22it's not again. It's like that movie um man, what is it? H it's Will Smith.33:29I am Legend. Just imagine just being in the world alone and um it just not the same.33:40It's just going to mess with you. You know, you're going to envy the day. You're going to be like, ""Man, I wish I was in front of that mushroom cloud.33:47Then you go back to your bunker, you just stuck in there. It's it's just that little tiny can that you have extra33:54sardine and you wish you could get uh given some to those who need it.""34:00So, I just want to share that from George.34:06Um he said that war is coming to Europe. War is war in Europe is coming.34:15He said it will go nuclear. It will go nuclear and the living shall envy the34:22dead. Says better to perish in first blast34:27than be a zombie dying slowly in algony.34:33That is very true. I mean,34:39now I tell people I don't have a bunker. Our bunker is the kingdom of heaven. That's our bunker.34:48Okay, give me a second here, guys. I want to see if there's any more34:53information. Hey, God bless every single one of you. I'mma read your messages, but let me just uh35:01let me see if there's any more information here. Any updates?35:06So far, there's no more earthquake. Um,35:13that's bas basically it. That is basically it.35:20All right, let me read your message. Happy Saturday. God bless to every single one of you. Hey, Blue Angel. How35:26you doing? Um, check the moon. What's wrong with the moon? Is a full moon tonight?35:35Yeah, to be honest, I don't know where a moon is at35:41grew up in the old tapping best place where in35:47where I'm in New York. I didn't feel anything. Um, well, that's a good thing.35:54Um, they said that it basically happened in New Jersey, but it was felt in New35:59York City. So, you know, people saying in Manhattan, um, but, uh, again,36:05I guess it's other areas, uh, people didn't feel it. Some people are36:11sensitive to full moons. Really?36:16Wow. Really? I mean, that's the first time I hear that.36:22That's the first time I hear that. Why would Russia want to fight the36:28sleeping giant through Europe instead of just going to Alaska?36:37Um, the reason why because you got the entire NATO alliance36:45just getting closer and closer to Russia. You got uh the new members36:50Sweden and Finland. Uh, so you got all these Europeans, uh, they just coming together. They36:58building up military. They're getting stuff ready. And I guess the bear sees sees that as a threat. So they trying to37:05focus on them first. Now, when it comes to the US, I believe there's a possibility China might deal with the US37:13in the future. And then you have North Korea. All right. So you're going to have those37:18countries that is going to join forces. You got the panda and uh you got the37:23dragon. I mean it's just going to be I don't think look to be honest I don't even think we're going to be able to37:30withstand these three uh uh country Russia, China and North Korea. Uh again37:36we don't have the money like that. WW3 is a lot of money. How much it cost to37:43fire a nuke? That's another question too. I mean, it it just all this money37:48stuff. We don't have the money for WW3. We gave37:54a lot of money to uh Zilinski. We gave that man everything.38:05Um,38:14give me a second.38:39Um so the cost to fire a nuclear is difficult to38:47determine precisely as it involves various factor and is not38:52a publicly disclosed figure. However, the cost of maintaining and modernizing39:00the nuclear arsenal, including delivery system, is estimated to be in the billions of dollars annually.39:0790 billion dollar just to keep up to39:12date with our nuclear. All right. 90 billion a year. So, how many nuclear do39:19we have? 5,000 plus. Yeah, I guarantee we don't keep up to date with 5,00039:24nukes. That's too much money. Monopoly money printed out thin air. Oh,39:32I heard that. Uh I think China banned cryptocurrency. I heard that. I heard that China just39:39banned cryptocurrency mining. So that's39:45another one too. That's a breaking news that came out today. A 3.4 for earthquake in North New39:52Jersey just over an hour. Yeah, but Linda, um that 3.4 I think it was downgraded to a 3.0.40:00Russia can't afford to have maintenance on their nuclear weapons. That's absolutely true. Who's that? N4 UPD.40:06Yeah, absolutely true. Uh again, these countries, they have thousands of nukes,40:12but uh again, they only keep like 500 or maybe a thousand. That's it. I mean, you40:18don't need 5,000 nukes to destroy a country. I mean, how many nukes does it take to destroy a country? Give me a40:24second here.40:32How many nukes?40:44How many nukes does it take to destroy the bear? Russia. Give me a second here. It is not40:50possible to uh definitely say how many nuclear it would take to destroy the40:58bear. Um41:05it doesn't give a specific uh number.41:30Okay. Yeah, it won't give a number,41:35but uh I mean my guess I mean41:43I mean have you seen the Russian nukes? I mean the Samart or the Satan 102. I41:49mean they call it the state of 102 or the bomba. I mean those man it just41:56that's like Freddy Krueger nightmare. Uh those are very very uh apocalyptic uh42:02nuclear they have there. Um if they drop that let's say on a city that's it is42:09gone. It's I mean their stuff is way too big way too powerful. Um,42:16and again, we have also equipments. We got stuff that the world has never seen.42:25According to Donald, we have things that the world has not seen yet and it will42:31leave people in shock. So, uh, we have things that, uh, could be much more42:37powerful than than Russian nukes. Lewis, I am42:43on your channel, my friend. We appreciate all the updates. Oh, thank you, Casey. I really Thank you so much,42:48guys. Wow, we almost at 500 likes. Thank you so much for your support. I really appreciate it. Can't believe can't42:55believe New York gets earthquake. Um, yeah. I mean, it's it's pretty rare.43:02I think the last time they got hit was like a year and a half ago. I remember they got hit a year and a half ago. All43:08right. So when you're aware, you get poor. Someone43:14said, ""Geez, man. Give me a second here.""43:35Okay, guys. Um, wow. We almost hit almost 50 minutes.43:43Where's the solar eclipse? Oh, give me a second here. The solar eclipse. From43:49what I heard, I think 7 billion people is going to see the solar eclipse.44:04Hold on. The solar eclipse. Um44:117 billion people. Hold on.44:21Okay. So,44:31on the night of September the 8th through the excuse me, September the 7th through the 8th. And by the way, that44:36would be the time that 144 country will recognize the Palestinian, you know who,44:43uh, as a state, the two-state solution. That's what they're trying to work on. So, on the 9th of September 7th through44:49the 8th, nearly 7 billion people, about 85% of the world population will witness44:56a total lunar eclipse. Wow.45:04So I heard it's India. I I think it's India and other countries.45:16Hold on. So the USA best view late in the evening on September 7 into the early hours of September the 8th.

I cant post this to the main PSSD subreddit since it's a sad censored cult, so i tought I'd post here. Not medical advice.

I noticed over the years some people get noticeably better or worse on certain medications and supplements including antibiotics, SAMe, 5-HTP,... these anecdotes seem to fit neatly with my theory.

So to resume my protocol:

•Reversing epigenetic changes, particularly the DNA methylation/reduced expression of SERT via induction of TET, and modulating hepcidin to enhance its activity. Note I'm not sure if the drugs are reliably proven to lead to this methylation, but I bet they do as it seems plausible. There's a rodent study showing that the SERT protein is critical for sexual function.

•Preventing re-methylation or hardening of the genetic suppression by treating over-methylation if present (This can be caused by overload of the metal copper, excess dietary or supplemental Choline/Betaine, an excess of Folate either from supplements or small intestinal bacterial production)

•Enhancing SERT activity via Vitamin B1, which is shown in studies. And reducing thiaminase (B1 destroyer) containing products such as green tea, coffee or nicotine. This one is quite simple.

As you see these first 3 points are all about enhancing serotonin reuptake, the mirror opposite of what the drugs do.

This is slowly working for me over a few months, and yes I believe the condition for me is mostly an elevation of serotonin. The way I see serotonin is through the lens of Ray Peat, an alternative medicine researcher who wrote extensively on the anti-metabolism, anti-sexuality effects of 5-HT.

No I haven't measured my 5-HIAA levels as I can barely get my doctor to give me an iron blood test.

There's a few more points and nuances I didn't mention here touching on the gut microbiome (not the generic buzzword stuff), enterochromaffin cells, liver pathways, hormones, supplements to use and those to avoid...

1mgsp6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1mgsp6d/together_2025_ending_theory_spoiler_warning/,Together (2025) Ending Theory (Spoiler Warning),"Now that the movie is finally out, I wanted to talk about the ending for Together and see what y'all think about it. The story was written in such a way where, even though there's a few rough spots, small and seemingly inconsequential details may actually have very big implications once they're all pieced together. If you take the ending at face value, it may seem sudden and anti-climactic. While the ending was abrupt and didn't answer much, I feel like there's enough breadcrumbs to piece together overall conclusion to the story. I really enjoyed this movie, even the ending, and hope that Michael Shanks does more like this.

Because I'm going to break down many of the key elements in the movie in the below sections, I will write a short summary of the theory. If you are interested in the entire observation and theory, please feel free to read the rest

# Short summary

>!Tim and Millie were manipulated and coerced into merging rather than it being of their own free will. The entity could manipulate both body and mind. When Tim and Millie touch hands, they feel waves of euphoria which erases negative feelings such as anger and terror. The first instance of this feeling is when they were walking back home after getting into a fight, and the second is despite their terror during the hallway scene, they immediately felt calm and relief once they touched hands, quelling their screams and protests.!<

>!Once their codependency reached an extreme enough level due to the fear of loss, where Tim nearly committed suicide and Millie nearly bleeding to death, the entity amplified their codependent feelings so that the final scene would play out the way that it did. With Tim and Millie's codependent nature amplified and them being in physical contact with another to suppress their negative feelings, their sense of self preservation is eroded, creating a false sense of acceptance, leading them to commit to the merging. Once they reached the point of no return, with their bodies so helplessly fused and no longer able to resist, their sense of self returns. This is indicated when an ominous ambience drowns out the song ""2 become 1"", they start whimpering and groaning, and show signs of fear such as pupil dilation and rapid eye movement.!<

>!The half merged abominations aren't necessarily created due to physical resistance, but instead due to one of the two (or more, in the case of the rats) either committing suicide during the merge or one killing the other. The border collie in the beginning had blood on its coat implying severe physical trauma or death, only 1 of the rats in the cluster was alive, and Simon's half of the Simon/Keri merge was clearly a corpse. There was never shown to be a half merged creature that didn't involve a corpse, and the effects of the merging has been shown to be ever persisting, even years later after a successful merge (as seen when Jamie's split face begins to rapidly re-fuse after being struck).!<

>!Jamie's comment about resisting, stating ""You wouldn't like the alternative"" is most likely an allusion to an intense desire to kill one's self or the other person. This is reinforced in the hallway scene when Millie was exclaiming that she wants to die. Jamie's comment could also imply intense physical pain during the merge, which is also reinforced during the hallway scene, or perhaps an ever persisting internal conflict once the merged being is created.!<

>!Additionally, it seems highly likely that Tillie is their own person and not a continuation of Tim and Millie. Tillie not fulfilling either Tim's or Millie's wishes about their final social media post and leaving it in a state where they both agreed would be a sad state to leave it in, as well as Tillie now aligning themselves with the cult and serving their interests, means that Tim and Millie no longer exists. It also seems that Tillie intends to give Millie's parents the contaminated water, the same way Jamie gave Millie the contaminated water, to regrow the cult.!<

>!The movie being an allegory for codependency is ultimately given narrative form through the presence of the supernatural force drawing Tim and Millie together. The entity being a force meant to represent extreme and toxic codependency is ultimately used to create a being where it's literally impossible to tell where one person ends and the other begins.!<

Now for the full breakdown of the key elements of the movie. Again, this is a long read, so grab a cup of coffee and hopefully enjoy.

>!The movie ends with Tim and Millie embracing each other to the Spice Girls song ""2 Become 1"", knowing they would merge. They begin kissing while their forms start melding together ultimately creating Tillie. However, despite their tender moment and confession of love, I don't think they were actually willing or in a clear state of mind. Also, based on the brief screentime after they merge, it seems most likely that while Tillie may have Tim and Millie's memories, Tillie is either not a continuation of their merged consciousness, is living in a state of conflict, or at the very least a thrall to the supernatural force that created them. The ending seems more tragic than bittersweet once you start looking a bit closer at all the other pieces. I'll break each key point that ties together and talk about my theory below.!<

# The Entity

>!Throughout the movie there is a supernatural force at play, which could be a curse, supernatural entity, demonic presence, or the like. Many of the elements in the story point towards a supernatural entity, so I'll be sticking with ""entity"" for this one.!<

>!The entity has been shown to be able to manipulate Tim and Millie in various different ways in an attempt to initiate merging. First, it very clearly had the ability to control their bodies like marionettes. Second, it has been shown to be able to put them into trance like states, almost like they are possessed. Third, the most important form of control, it demonstrated the ability to manipulate and amplify emotions, exploiting their feelings for each other in order to achieve its end goal. For instance, when Tim was giving Millie a massage, he started losing himself in the act of touching her. In another instance, Tim had been compelled to seek out Millie and engage in sex in a public space. And finally in another instance, when Millie laced hands with Tim after drinking the water, she seemed to be at peace and serene. These are clear signs that the entity can not only manipulate emotions, but also amplify a person's emotional needs desires to be with one another to the point where rational thought goes out the window. It was also demonstrated that after Millie drank the water, she was emotionally and psychologically bound to Tim, feeling what he feels, likely creating a feedback loop between each other. Tim was able to leverage the link between the to stop Millie from leaving the room they were in, and felt what she was feeling.!<

# The Cult

>!For reasons unknown to the viewer, the cult has worshiped the entity, building a church where they conduct merging. The church no longer exists, but the cave it was built on still exists with contaminated water that when drunk, will trigger the merging effect. The cultists have been seen slashing each other's wrists prior to merging, and then engaging in the merging process. The slashing of their wrists was not a requirement for the merge, but helps speed up the process according to Jamie. But the slashing of the wrists seems to serve another purpose - forcing the two people to commit unless they want to die.!<

# Millie and Jamie's interaction

>!Jamie, who was later revealed to be a merged person, recited a brief synopsis to Plato's Symposium to Millie when she was confiding in him after getting into a fight with Tim. Quoting Plato's Symposium seems to be a way for the cult to lure unsuspecting recruits into their fold. When Jamie gave Millie a glass of water, likely the contaminated water from the cave, he started prying at Millie's relationship with Tim. Jamie started relating Millie's relationship with Tim to his codependent relationship with his merged half, and summarized Plato's Symposium just as Millie started drinking the contaminated water. Jamie was getting ready to show Millie his ""wedding"" video where his two halves merged, but was interrupted by Tim. This is a clear indication that his intentions are to indoctrinate new victims into the cult. When Millie returns to Jamie's house, and watches the video, she is approached by Jamie. Jamie then slashes her wrist, leading her to escape his house, and encounter Tim.!<

>!After Millie hit Jamie and scrambled to get away, Jamie stated ""Your divine happiness is flowing through us"". This almost makes it seem like whatever is influencing them has created a hive mind, which is reinforced by the fact Tim and Millie are emotionally and psychologically linked after they both drank the water. This was demonstrated when Tim was able to manipulate their link to stop Millie from leaving the room, and felt what she was feeling. Also, after Jamie's face split in two, it started rapidly re-merging, implying that Jamie, and likely any other merged being, is forever under the influence of the entity that had created him.!<

# Millie and Tim's near death experience

>!Tim, who found two half merged people, notices that one of the two people had died during the merging process, effectively halting it. When Tim and Millie encounter each other, Tim says his final goodbyes despite Millie's protests, and prepares to commit suicide. Just before Tim attempts suicide, Millie begins dying of blood loss due to Jamie's cut. This prompts Tim to abandon his suicide attempt, grabs Millie's wrist to heal her wound, and brings her back home.!<

# The merging theory

>!It seems that Tim and Millie's emotions had been exploited and manipulated in the final scene of the movie to create a false sense of acceptance. While they genuinely love each other and didn't want to be apart from each other, I don't believe they were actually willing to merge despite their embrace being calm and passionate. Circle back to the entity's ability to manipulate people on a psychological level, its ability to amplify emotions, and that Tim and Millie are emotionally bound. It seems most likely that Tim and Millie's near death experience created a strong enough emotional response and heightened sense of codependency, amplified by Tim and Millie's emotional bond to create an ever increasing feedback loop between the two. This could allow the entity to finally manipulate them on an emotional level and suppress their unwillingness to create a sense of serenity in order to achieve the goal of merging. This could be another reason as to why the cultists slash their wrists prior to merging - to create an emotional response that commits them to merging, else they face death, lose their partner, and potentially end up a monster if the other survives.!<

>!When Millie woke up to find Tim's hand merged to her wrist, she immediately surrendered despite the terror she felt at the prospect of merging and the desire to die during the hallway scene. However, the night prior, their hands and entire forearms had merged together, and they were able to separate despite the fact their hands forearms were more deeply intertwined and merged than when Tim's hand merged with Millie's wrist. They weren't so far gone that they couldn't have separated once again, since they already accomplished that feat the previous night, and still had 2 painkillers and probably whiskey to numb the supernatural effect.!<

>!When their final merging started, the scene opens with them embracing each other, kissing passionately while listening to ""2 Become 1"". However, once they have reached a point where their arms are fully absorbed, their legs uselessly tangled together, and their torsos halfway merged, the song is drowned out by an ominous ambience. Their eyes go wide, and they start groaning, with the scene becoming eerie and uneasy. Once their heads start merging, their eyes start dilating and frantically moving, which is a classic sign of fear. Combine this with their trembling groans, the scene creates a sense of panic and terror. It seems like once they reached the point of no return and are left unable to resist the merging and attempt separation, their sanity and sense of self had finally returned, their malformed bodies leaving them helpless to prevent it. This falls in line with the elements of psychological and body horror on display in the film - leaving Tim and Millie fully aware and fearful during their final moments, but are no longer able to prevent their fate. The movie being an allegory for codependency leans heavily into this, leaving Tim and Millie in a forced state of coexistence.!<

>!While I'm not discrediting the possibility that Tim and Millie may have actually merged together willingly, the entity's ability to manipulate them, as well as the sudden acceptance prior to merging and tonal shift during the merging seems too intentional from a storytelling perspective to just be a coincidence. The shift from Tim's willingness to commit suicide and Millie's horror at the revelation they aren't the first to merge was very sudden, and the mutual fear they felt towards the situation suddenly becoming calm and tender is extremely abrupt and seems less genuine and more a result of the entity's influence. This becomes even more likely when you consider that the two times Tim and Millie touched hands, they showed signs of serenity. The first time is when Millie was mad at Tim and he touched her hand, and she immediately became calm with the tone of the scene being of bliss. The second time is during the hallway scene, after they were controlled like marionettes, the moment they touched hands, their terror gave way and they once again showed signs of bliss. The bliss felt when in physical contact could very well have been in effect when Millie woke up with Tim's hand merged with her wrist, thus initiating the false acceptance.!<

>!Throughout the movie, none of the half-merged creatures were in a state where both halves were alive. In the beginning of the movie, the two dogs who have merged shows that the border collie has blood on its coat, and moments prior there was sounds of a struggle. It seems likely that the border collie died during the merge, and even if the border collie wasn't dead, the scene was too fast to tell if the merging stopped. The same can be said about the rats, because only one of the rats was left alive in the group that Tim pulled out. While Jamie's warning about resisting the merging seems ominous, there's just no clear evidence or example of what could happen if they do resist. Out of all the times Tim and Millie resisted, there was no signs of mutation, and the merging continued to be a relentless force despite their resistance. It could have meant that resisting could lead to an extreme desire to die or kill the partner during the process, or it could have other implications as well.!<

>!Even if resisting is a key component in creating a half merged abomination, we just don't know for sure what degree of resistance is required. Did Jamie mean emotional resistance, physical resistance, or mental resistance? And if so, to what degree of resistance is needed? Because again, the entity controlling them showed signs of being able to manipulate all 3 states (physical, emotional, and mental). There just isn't any indication that the entity couldn't manipulate them as needed to create a successful merger.!<

# Tillie theory

>!The creation of Tillie (the Tim/Millie merger) has a number of implications that ultimately gives the end of Tim and Millie's story a tragic end. Regardless if their merger was actually unwilling and orchestrated by the entity, evidence points towards Tillie being a thrall to the entity, and is now a member of the cult. The bell on their porch bears the cult's symbol, and when Tillie answers the door for Millie's parents, Tillie gives of a very nonchalant ""Hey"" that is devoid of emotion or urgency. This lack of emotion and the embrace of the cult's symbology gives the impression that Tim and Millie is effectively destroyed, or at least their free will being corrupted or suppressed to serve the entity's will.!<

>!I can't help but wonder if Tillie lives in a constant state of inner conflict. When Millie struck Jamie, Jamie's head partially split and started speaking in a dual tone, implying that the two original people may still exist in some capacity even if they are suppressed or corrupted. If you take into account the themes of codependency, and how two people could be drawn together despite constantly fighting with one another, Tillie could exist in such limbo where Tim and Millie's issues never gets resolved, as they were never given the chance to resolve them as separate beings.!<

>!Tim and Millie's lack of reconciliation as separate individuals could explain why in the final scene Tim's social media page is up on his laptop just prior to answering the door. Earlier in the movie, Tim asked Millie to delete his profile page if he dies. Millie says that if she were to make one final post, it would be ""BRB"", which she later asks Tim to put on her social media page when she's dying due to blood loss. As Tillie, Tim's social media page is open, still up and functional despite his wish to delete the page, and still has the ""We took the plunge"" comment instead of posting ""BRB"" like what Millie wanted. Tillie never fulfilled either Tim's or Millie's wish, despite having more than enough time to unpack and set up the house. This seems to indicate Tillie being in a state of internal conflict, or is unable to reconcile their new existence with Tim and Millie's past. Also, due to Tillie's lack of emotion when greeting Millie's parents, and Tillie's thrall-like state, it also seems quite possible that Tillie is their own entity and not a continuation of Tim and Millie's, adding another tragic layer to the couples' fate.!<

# Philosophical Interpretation

>!The movie being an allegory for codependency makes it seem like the entity is actually codependency manifested in supernatural form. Throughout the movie, whenever Tim and Millie would try to part ways, that's when the their manipulation was at its strongest. Codependent individuals always return to one another, and that's exactly what happened all throughout the movie. If you consider that the entity is codependency given supernatural form, then it would seem that the final merging between Tim and Millie ultimately means that their codependent nature won.!<

>!The entity representing toxic codependency amplifies the movie's themes by externalizing codependency as a coercive force (the entity/cult mirroring abusive relational patterns), exploiting emotional wounds like Tim's trauma or the couple's resentment to enforce fusion, resulting in a ""descent into relationship hell"" where the ""we"" devours the ""I."" The merger critiques the myth of soulmates, warning that unchecked codependency leads to a permanent, identity-erasing bond, blending body horror with relational allegory for a melancholy cautionary tale.!<

# Final Thoughts

All in all I thought the ending was very well crafted. Even if it seemed anticlimactic, the supernatural elements throughout the movie seems to give enough detail to fill in some of the blanks, and leaves me wanting more. With Tim and Millie's story coming to an end, it makes me wonder where Michael Shanks could take this going forward. I would love to hear any thoughts or theories you may have.",3,1754250748.0,horror,0,0.8,False
1mgso9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NemesisCrew/comments/1mgso9b/questions_for_a_newbie_components_and_storage/,Questions for a Newbie (Components and Storage),"Hey everyone- just joined this community, and I’m happy to be here. I played OG Nemesis at my friend’s one night and was snake bitten. Fast forward to the Gamefound campaign for Retaliation and I went all-in (for me). I ended up with all three games, acrylic packs, terrain expansions, construct pack, play mats, etc. I want to take these games to another board game pod and deliver a premium gaming experience. So as you can imagine, I now have 10ish medium to large boxes sitting on my coffee table in the middle of the living room. So my two questions are:
 
1. Has anyone devised an ideal storage solution for these games? I’m thinking about some sort of cabinet or modular drawer system where you can have your OG Nemesis-exclusive content, Lockdown-exclusive content, Retaliation-exclusive content, and “shared content” (I.e., noise markers, fire tokens, etc.). Ideally it’d maintain a modicum of portability and I’d be able to apply labels to various sections. I’m really curious to hear what people have chosen to do for their Nemesis collections!
 
2. For the “shared” content mentioned above: can I combine those things from across all three games? For example, game comes with a specific/different number of fire acrylic tokens- can I just combine all of them into one spot or do they need to be kept separate for any reason (I seem to recall my friend saying the ship blows up if you run out of fire tokens or something like that)?
 
Thank you so much to everyone who reads this and has any advice or recommendations for me to try out!",2,1754250686.0,NemesisCrew,0,1.0,False

A couple of notes: The Kickstarter (just a marketing launch approach) ends soon (Mon Aug 4 9:45am EDT). Scheduled to ship by end of August. $599, $20 shipping. 

The UI is basically a smartphone app on a smartphone-esque touchscreen.. Everything is customizable, incl. actual temperature (in degrees) and coffee/foam/water volumes and  order, plus lots more. Max dose is 12g. Aesthetically, it looks super clean/minimal, and has a black matte finish.

Does cold brew (low-temp pulsed pressure extraction), and both hot and cold foam from the same carafe. (It has dual draw tubes and dual ports.)

There's a fully functional app, and ota firmware updates. You can schedule drinks, save many (unlimited?) user profiles and favorites, track drink stats, etc.

Cleaning functions seem thorough. Nonremovable brew group, cleaning cycle uses tablets (e.g. Cafiza?).  

Kaxfree is a brand/division/subsidiary(?) of Kalerm, that makes advanced superautos.

Full disclosure: After about a week of research (YouTube, websites) I decided to support this KS. I've been eyeing the Delonghi Eletta Explore, largely to add cold drinks, but the Kaxfree looks to do all that and more, and is a lot more customizable at less than half the price. The single milk carafe is a big plus for me. Interested in others' thoughts, and I will post a review here when I get it. (I currently have a Gaggia Magenta Prestige for direct comparison.

Well, that's disappointing","I had 11 survivors, and I thought the cap was 12, and I reached the end of the Trumbull Valley campaign(For some reason never got to see or hear Reba even though I read she was in this campaign), and got 3 survivors coming in to request to join

So I had a Charles(Ik, names change) who is an old guy with a lot of ailments, never really use him beyond companion material, but had the ""People person"" quirk so I kept him around, and I have one Law, who is a coffee maker, but I have a bartender, so I decided to send both to legacy and then accept the 3 and have the 12 survivors, as I read that last mission is the only way to go above 9...

One survivor has stitching, great! Other has cooking and another has building, but I had just 3 girls and 8 guys, so I thought it great to even the numbers, 6 girls and 6 guys... oh surprise surprise, VERY BAD surprise, after dismissing the 2 into legacy pool, I can still only accept the one survivor, ""Can't take all of you but will be happy to take you in(And to boot, the worse of the 3, the one that has building, which I already have maxed out with Ricardo, who in this case is the husband in the starter group when I chose the apocalypse marriage, so now I cannot recruit the 3 of them, ending up with 1 less survivor instead, of 1 more, and the worst of the 3 to boot

Is it just me or did they downgrade SOD2 in some aspects?

Cannot recruit full settlements, they remain allied but if you want to recruit you can only do the 1, no more.

Cannot have more than 7 ouposts but only if you have the right skills and people, when that was, IIRC the max outposts and it depended on your base

Cannot have more than 12... I remember having, I think it was 15, in the base game SOD1, and it was way better.

People that leave the community to gather resources will never call for help(I actually liked that feature)

Don't get me wrong, the game is awesome, there is a reason why I have been playing it for 3 weeks straight and soldiered through Hearland(which I highly disliked) to get the backstory for trumbull, and I will keep on playing(Methinks I will just start a new settlement for now) but yeah, some things feel like a downgrade instead of an upgrade",0,1754250544.0,StateofDecay2,0,0.5,False

In my 30s my friends have either become “digital nomads” and left the country to travel/work or they’ve gotten married and had babies and mostly hang out w other married couples w babies. They are very busy with their families and jobs and don’t have the energy to do a lot more understandably. 

My digital nomad friends (people I used to see all the time) send me the occasional text here and there during their travels and that’s about it. They swing by once every couple years to see family and I’ll see them for a brief coffee before they go back to traveling. 

I’ve now been left in a “dead zone”. I’m happy being an introvert but I also wish I could experience things w other people like visit national parks, do random stuff, volunteer, do weekend trips, etc. Never wanted to get married and have babies so I’m okay in that aspect but still—it feels dead out here.

1mgsk2n,https://v.redd.it/hht6s9soyugf1,First Espresso Setup,"This is basically my first espresso setup after doing some initial research, reading subreddits, and watching video reviews. Total cost was around $500. 
I picked up a HiBrew H10B 51mm because I saw that it has a PID controller for temperature, basic pressure gauge, and it was on a sale via Amazon a few weeks ago. I have played around with temperature settings between 194°F to 202°F; I am not sure I can notice a huge difference in temperature changes, considering the grind and espresso pull time are kept consistent. 
For a grinder I bought the 1Zpresso J-Ultra hand grinder, which I’ve found 1.2 turns seems to be a good setting for the beans I bought locally. This is resulting in a 32g pull of espresso from 16g beans in about 25-28s. 
I do have a HiBrew bottomless portafilter with unpressurized basket. 
Other than those key items, I have various accessories like WDT, grounds funnel for portafilter, tamper, and puck screen. 
I always use water that’s been filtered from my fridge that then goes through a countertop PUR filter pitcher before going into my espresso water tank. 
This video is from this morning trying out 202°F but I will probably go back to 194°F tomorrow morning. 
The flavor is pretty neutral, not bitter nor sour. I recently found on a trip to Baton Rouge, Louisiana that most of the coffee shops there make sour tasting espresso; I only found one shop that made a good shot.

Most traders only think about what they do during the session. But what I’ve found is that what I do before the bell rings is what really shapes my performance.

Here’s the exact morning routine I follow every day, without fail:

6:30 AM - Wake-up (2.5 hours before the open)  
No charts. Just wake up, stand up, and get the body moving. First action sets the tone.

6:35 AM - Quick cold rinse or cold shower  
It wakes me up instantly and forces me into the present. No better way to shake off drowsiness and reset mentally.

6:45 AM - Walk or mobility for 15–20 minutes  
I get outside or move my body indoors. Not for fitness but for clarity. This clears my head more than any YouTube clip ever could.

7:15 AM - Breathing exercise or guided meditation  
It brings my nervous system down and sharpens my ability to focus under pressure.  
You can look up breathing exercises on YouTube and put on some headphones and lock in.

8:00 AM - Black coffee (no screens yet)  
I’ve found caffeine hits better if I’m already awake for at least 90 minutes. No dopamine rushes from screens, just stillness.

8:30 AM - Sit down and prep for open (no trades yet)  
I have a strict rule: no trades 30 minutes before the bell. Instead, I spend this time doing three things:

\- Review my pre-written game plan from the night before  
\- Mark out overnight highs/lows from Asia and London  
\- Adjust levels only if overnight PA shifts something meaningful

Before I take any trade, I answer 3 questions:

\- Where is price being pulled toward?  
\- What’s liquidity showing me?  
\- Is there real confluence or am I manufacturing a setup?

This isn’t about chasing perfection. It’s about stepping into the day regulated, focused, and sharp. That’s what allows me to pull the trigger only when it makes sense.

I’m happy to share my game plan template if anyone’s curious about how I map the day.

Hi again. Everything going fine this evening? 

No? Why not? 

Oh, no, me being here was supposed to be a good thing. I just walked in, so that stings. Can’t appease everyone these days. Or, ever for that matter.

You’re wearing silver now? Really? Most of them look fake anyways, except for the necklace- ohhhhh, I see what you’re doing. It still won’t work. The rings being plated means there’s less actual silver on you and the rest of your skin is still fair game. Not even that necklace can protect you. Unless you’ve got some shining armor lying around, you’re still meat. 

Don’t worry, I’m still going for your neck. Easy. You need a spinal cord to live, otherwise you’re a deer in headlights. It’s the most fragile part of the body, which means it’s the most controllable. Why make it harder for myself when it’s already so simple?

Is that a dare? I’m already telling you, it’s the most simple, and the least painful. If I want it to be. Now hurry up, I’m starving.

You’re trying to clean *now*? It’s 5:47 am. No one else is even here, again. What do you even have to clean up? All the blinds are open. The tables and chairs are fine.

\[opening drawer\] 

The compost bin?!- Okay, fine. Sure. Go throw coffee grounds for minimum wage.

\[footsteps as listener goes out with bucket, audio more distant while dumping bucket\]

I honestly thought one of your coworkers was going to be here instead. Quitting is the easiest thing you could have done. No more messing up your circadian rhythm for money. You could have been on the run, and I would have found out and started chasing you.

\[closing door, footsteps back to counter\] 

Dawwww, you don’t like the idea of running? I think it’s fun. Just imagine it. You’re stumbling as you run away, your blood rushing through your veins as you keep looking around for me. \[gasp\] What was that? A streetlight flickering ominously! And in that split second of darkness… your heart rate spikes, that special shiver runs down your spine as you realize what’s about to happen, and I get the best meal I’ve had in a while.

\[placing bucket back\] 

Your heart’s racing again. Good.

\[slam drawer close\]

Yeesh, okay. Relax. Actually, don’t. I told you to keep your blood pumping after all. 

No, I’m not ordering anything. Again. 

Suggestion, question, you’re still trying to get a quick buck out of me. Even if I wanted to, my digestive system wouldn’t be able to handle it.

It’s like, what’s it called again… food poisoning. Stomach gets queasy, nausea, all the works. 

A pastry. For me?

\[paper bag rustling\]

…You saved this. For me. 

Red velvet- that’s obviously not going to work. You can’t slap red food dye onto something and think I can eat it. 

The thought that counts- the thought sucks. 

Quit trying to make me eat it, it’s almost-

\[mischievous laugh\]

Clever. You think stalling for time will help you? Sunrise isn’t until the next twenty minutes. No one is coming to save you. 

\[woosh- speaker right behind listener, about to bite\]

Stop interrupting me.

Yeah, I did. Rove said that they’ve been here once before, that’s why I agreed to be here. 

You really think you can find them with one measly order? 

Hm… there’s only so far a lead can go. Even if you do have footage and receipts, you’ll be wasting my time if it’s a dead end. Just like right now.

Searching for them day and night… so you’ll fix your sleep schedule so you can look during the day and I look at night… a 24/7 hunt… I could still do all of this by myself… Rove would appreciate the free drinks though.

You-... you want to be bait? For other vampires? No one’s that desperate for blood- nevermind. There are some freaks out there. 

Wow. You’re so… hopeless. At least you know some stuff- well, as much as you think you know. You’ll always be a liability, but you might as well be useful. Unfortunately, I still need a drink. But I’ll be nice, and not go overboard whenever I need it. And, this should go without saying, but just in case- double cross me, and you instantly become a corpse. Honor code and all of that. Do we have a deal?

Of course I still need blood. Hunger doesn’t magically go away. Don’t bother trying to deny what I’m already telling you. You are only meant to be consumed by what you can’t understand. Get that in your head.

Alright then. Now, care to give me a drink? Close the blinds first, I’m not risking getting sunburnt. To ash.

\[footsteps, blinds closing\]

So if you’re going to be awake during the day, that means you have to change your work schedule.

You better make them switch shifts with you if you cover for them often. 

\[footsteps back\]

Of course you getting paid extra is good, it’s still the gesture of you covering for them that’s still there. Now come on. It’ll be quick and as painless as it can be. 

Oh man, I didn’t think the coffee bean smell would be this strong. Lower your shoulders, don’t slouch. I’ll bite the back of your neck just enough to break the skin and so it’ll be less obvious. Just think of it as my lips pinching you.

Look, the more you move, the more blood I could draw. It’ll be okay. Promise.

Ready?

Okay. Here.

\[bite- a shallow one\]

Huh? What the-

\[clears throat\]

I-it tastes just fine. It’s… it’s amazing. I’m glad I didn’t have it all in one go. It would have been bad if it was all gone.  

The safety kit’s in here?

\[opens drawer\]

\[places first aid kit on table, opens it\]

First aid supplies shouldn’t be this dusty. Whatever. Here.

\[opening alcohol pad\]

No one looks at the back of your neck often, right?

Chill. The sting will go away in a second. You’re acting like you haven’t scraped a knee or elbow.

\[opening bandaid\] 

I wish this bandaid had some kind of cartoon character on it. It could’ve been a tattoo for a few days.

\[placing bandaid on\]

There. Awwwww, your face is turning red. That doesn’t sound like a bad name for you. Can I call you that? 

Trick question. Too bad Red. 

Like I’d tell you my name- Here. You need to eat. 

\[paper bag rustling\] 

Nope. The healthier you are, the better your blood will be. And your mind and the rest of it. And the faster we find the people who had the nerve to steal from me. First task, look for Rove on the security cameras. I only have one picture of them, they look like this.

Yeah… the quality’s really bad. It’s better than me trying to draw their face on a napkin.

\[bell rings, footsteps approaching\]

Right. You actually have a job. I need to head out anyways, sun’s almost up. Catch you later, Red.

Searching for them day and night… so you’ll fix your sleep schedule so you can look during the day and I look at night… a 24/7 hunt… I could still do all of this by myself… Rove would appreciate the free drinks though.

You-... you want to be bait? For other vampires? No one’s that desperate for blood- nevermind. There are some freaks out there. 

Wow. You’re so… hopeless. At least you know some stuff- well, as much as you think you know. You’ll always be a liability, but you might as well be useful. Unfortunately, I still need a drink. But I’ll be nice, and not go overboard whenever I need it. And, this should go without saying, but just in case- double cross me, and you instantly become a corpse. Honor code and all of that. Do we have a deal?

Of course I still need blood. Hunger doesn’t magically go away. Don’t bother trying to deny what I’m already telling you. You are only meant to be consumed by what you can’t understand. Get that in your head.

Alright then. Now, care to give me a drink? Close the blinds first, I’m not risking getting sunburnt. To ash.

\[footsteps, blinds closing\]

So if you’re going to be awake during the day, that means you have to change your work schedule.

You better make them switch shifts with you if you cover for them often. 

\[footsteps back\]

Of course you getting paid extra is good, it’s still the gesture of you covering for them that’s still there. Now come on. It’ll be quick and as painless as it can be. 

Oh man, I didn’t think the coffee bean smell would be this strong. Lower your shoulders, don’t slouch. I’ll bite the back of your neck just enough to break the skin and so it’ll be less obvious. Just think of it as my lips pinching you.

Look, the more you move, the more blood I could draw. It’ll be okay. Promise.

Ready?

Okay. Here.

\[bite- a shallow one\]

Huh? What the-

\[clears throat\]

I-it tastes just fine. It’s… it’s amazing. I’m glad I didn’t have it all in one go. It would have been bad if it was all gone.  

The safety kit’s in here?

\[opens drawer\]

\[places first aid kit on table, opens it\]

First aid supplies shouldn’t be this dusty. Whatever. Here.

\[opening alcohol pad\]

No one looks at the back of your neck often, right?

Chill. The sting will go away in a second. You’re acting like you haven’t scraped a knee or elbow.

\[opening bandaid\] 

I wish this bandaid had some kind of cartoon character on it. It could’ve been a tattoo for a few days.

\[placing bandaid on\]

There. Awwwww, your face is turning red. That doesn’t sound like a bad name for you. Can I call you that? 

Trick question. Too bad Red. 

Like I’d tell you my name- Here. You need to eat. 

\[paper bag rustling\] 

Nope. The healthier you are, the better your blood will be. And your mind and the rest of it. And the faster we find the people who had the nerve to steal from me. First task, look for Rove on the security cameras. I only have one picture of them, they look like this.

Yeah… the quality’s really bad. It’s better than me trying to draw their face on a napkin.

\[bell rings, footsteps approaching\]

Right. You actually have a job. I need to head out anyways, sun’s almost up. Catch you later, Red.

Hey friends! As many of you know, I took my team on a 9-night retreat to Cabo to check out some of our fave properties in the area and I'll be dropping a review of each property. We had a blast despite the stifling heat haha - and yes, Cabo still does get humid in the summer, it's not as dry as you may expect. But luckily it doesn't really rain so it's a way better summer choice as opposed to PVR/Riviera Nayarit or the Cancun/Riviera Maya area.

For Four Seasons Cabo del Sol we stayed in one of the Ocean View 4 BR Residences so you'll see that room category displayed in my video as well as the standard casitas and the casita suites. We also toured the Casona rooms but didn't get vids that I can share because they were in the process of being turned over.

One thing to note: Richard Raab, the GM, would love to do an AMA with us so if there is interest in hearing from him directly, I'd be happy to arrange it. So let me know if you'd like me to bring him on to chat with us.

\--

**Where we went**: Four Seasons Cabo del Sol

**When we went**: July 2025, it was HOT!

**Who went**: Team trip

**Pictures of the property**: Video attached

**Background/overview**: Four Seasons Cabo del Sol opened in May 2024 and it was built as an homage to the traditional Mexican hacienda but with a modern twist and take on luxury. Of all the Cabo properties it most reminds me of One & Only Palmilla. It has a similar aesthetic of crisp white hacienda buildings with different areas of congregation and focus and an emphasis on lush landscaping. Overall the property feels incredibly luxurious and glam. It definitely attracts a clientele that is more brand-aware/brand focused than some of the other more understated Cabo properties. I'd put the clientele more on the same vibe as Las Ventanas vs properties like Pamilla, Esperanza & Chileno Bay. A large chunk of the property is made up of their Residence product and they have the best multi-bedroom product in Cabo in my opinion. I'll speak more on that below. Since opening in 2024 they have had an amazing reception from guests (even in a very crowded luxury resort market) and when we went in late July, the property was nearly at full occupancy. When they first opened they did have some service/hard product snafus (a few of my clients in here can attest to those hiccups) but they have worked all of that out since opening and it's running really smoothly now.

**Service**: *9/10*

* The service at FS Cabo del Sol is really top notch. They did an excellent job training their staff and while I don't know their staff to guest ratio, I can assure you it's high because despite the high occupancy we never had to wait for anything. Their buggy service was the snappiest I've had in a long time. When we ordered room service, it was to our residence in an astonishing 17 minutes.
* I will say, the staff is a bit more formal than I generally prefer. The service is more similar to the more structured service of an O&O Palmilla vs the more relaxed, easy going luxury service of Chileno Bay and Esperanza. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just a good thing to know when you're trying to figure out if this is the right selection for you.

**Property**: *9/10*

[I did a detailed resort map for everyone bc I find it much easier to get a sense of the property this way](https://preview.redd.it/l1v5eaj7sugf1.jpg?width=1703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49170c205c129938158785e141c0cae8c70331ad)

* The property is absolutely stunning. They spared no expense on the design and construction. Everything is extremely high quality from the buildings to the landscaping to the decor to the facilities.
* It's also good to understand the scale of the property. It's quite large. It has 96 rooms and suites with another 61 villas, residences and estates - all situated on 50 acres of beachfront property. To put that in perpsective, Chileno Bay is 22 acres and has nearly the same number of rooms/suites and residences. Consequently FS feels really spacious with lots of amenities because it has roughly the same number of units but more than 2x the total land.
* Like many of the Cabo properties, the property is built out like a horseshoe. In the case of Cabo del Sol there's two horseshoes that connect in the middle around the main resort building, La Casona. The South side horseshoe is built out around Brisal - the adults pool and the North side is built out around Coraluz, the family pool. There are 4 levels to the property. Each level is built up from the one below it so there's actually a lot of vertical distance between them - especially as you get up to the 3rd and 4th levels with the residences. While I do love the resort, the one thing that made it an 9/10 for me vs 10/10 is how steep everything is. Depending on your room location, it can be difficult to navigate. It is not the most accessible resort and can result in you needing to rely on carts to get around if you're older or have mobility issues or have really young kids. Though this really isn't a concern if you're in the normal casitas or casona rooms.
* The base level is the beach + pools + restaurants like Cayao & Coraluz and then some of the oceanfront casitas/villas. Then the next level up has the ocean view casitas, La Casona - the main resort building, the Mercado, the spa, the art center, the discovery center, the kids club and the teens club. Up from that is the 3rd layer which is a layer of residences/villas and then the top 4th level is another layer of residences/villas. The 13 estates are actually even further back on the property and aren't included in these 4 levels I'm describing.
* If you're in the Casona rooms or any of the casitas or casita suites, getting around is pretty easy. You might encounter a set of stairs here and there between the pool and restaurants but it won't be a huge hassle. The distance is more of a thing with the Residences which are further up in the property and quite a bit steeper and that's where you'll rely more on the carts unless you want to go up and down several sets of steep stairs every time you come down to the main resort area.
* One thing to note is that this property never feels crowded. This is not like FS Maui or the like. Seriously - when we were there the resort was at 96% and it barely felt like anyone was there. This is because 1) the property is big with a lot of areas to go but 2) so much of the room product is residences and villas where people hang in their rooms and even of the casitas and suites - >50% of them have their own private pools. This is a property where people spend a lot of time in their rooms/suites/residences. So it's never going to feel crazy crowded. But consequently, it's also not the same level of social experience that you get at a property like Esperanza and Chileno Bay. It's much more of a private experience where you moreso stick to your group. You certainly can hang out in communal areas and see other people, but the overall vibe contributes to a feeling of keeping more to yourself / your crew than some of the other Cabo spots.

**Rooms**: *This one is super tough, for most of the rooms it's a clear 10/10, no notes and for some it's more like a 7/10 due to privacy issues. Will share more below*

* The actual room product at FS Cabo del Sol is immaculate. Everything is absolutely top notch in terms of quality, design, space, layouts, etc. The design is beautiful and super fresh without feeling ultra modern.
* Rooms at FS Cabo del Sol are the following:
   * La Casona rooms are in the main hotel building - and while these are technically entry level, they don't feel entry level at all and are really lovely with incredible ocean views.
   * The Casita Rooms are located in various casita buildings dotted along the property in the front by the pools and the beach. Each casita building has 4 casita rooms/suites within them. There are two lower rooms and two upper rooms. The lower rooms have the plunge pools and the upper rooms have the better ocean views. There are both Ocean View Casitas and Oceanfront Casitas. You can see where I marked them out on the map.
   * There are a ton of Residences - 60+ which are along the top two levels of the property. The Residences can be 2 BR, 3 BR, 4 BR or 5BR. The 4 BR is the most common one.
* All of the rooms face the ocean and even the entry level La Casona rooms have absolutely incredible ocean views. The only rooms without a good ocean view are some of the Casita Plunge Pool rooms - especially the ones situated above the family pool because they are too low to have much of an ocean view.
* The biggest issue with the rooms is privacy. To be totally honest, some of the casitas (both rooms and suites) are really poorly positioned on the paths such that just walking by - you can see into the entire thing without even trying. This is really only an issue for the lower floor ones with the plunge pools, specifically the units on the end or the ones positioned right in front of certain walking paths. There are rooms that have more privacy but you really need to work with your TA or the hotel in order to make sure you're placed in one with better privacy. You can see some of theses examples in my video. Some of this will get better with time as the vegetation grows in further - but some of it is just based on the design.

**Food**: *9/10*

* Food here is great. There's a lot of variety and you could stay a week and not be bored.
* Palmerio is the all-day dining with breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's Mediterranean/Italian with lots of pastas on order. They have one of the best breakfasts in Cabo with both a great buffet & a la carte options, though I think Las Ventanas may still be the winner here.
* Cayao is the beachfront restaurant on the far south side of the property that is a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian. There's a fried chicken dish of some sort that I can't remember the name of that my team went nuts for and the udon noodle dish is fire too.
* Coraluz is the Baja Mexican restaurant by the family pool - serves lunch and dinner.
* There's a great bar area called Sora that you def have to go to for views and drinks.
* There's also a bar/food area by the adults pool and another bar in La Casona - the main building.
* They also have this awesome spot called El Mercado which is a great little cafe/breakfast/coffee spot that it's in the main square. It's a nice grab and go place for breakfast or for an afternoon snack and the cookies and gelato here are fire
* The food, like all the luxury Cabo resorts, is really expensive so keep that in mind
* It's not a 10/10 for me because there wasn't any one restaurant that totally blew me away and I think there are properties with slightly better signature restaurants (ie Comal at Chileno Bay) - but the food game here is still really, really strong.

**Extras & activities**: *9/10*

* The kids club, as usual - is great and super immersive with lots of activities and fun things for the kids to do. There's both an indoor and outdoor center.
* There's also a great teens club that offers arcade games, ping pong, video games,
* The property has it's own adventure center on property to help with any activities you want to schedule as well.
* The beach here is beautiful, but not swimmable due to the rocks and strength of the waves. You'll be spending your time in the pools not the beach. There are very few Cabo properties with legit swimmable beaches. Chileno Bay and O&O Palmilla are two examples of properties with really nice, swimmable beaches.

**Important notes**

* This property is a big wedding spot. They have put a ton of money into their events center and so there are a lot of weddings here. A smaller wedding wouldn't be disruptive to the overall experience because there's still so much space and like I said, it's not a property that ever feels overrun - but if you're there during a big wedding event, you're going to feel it.
* There are some great perks and offers that come with this property btw. Per FS rules, we can't share them publicly but feel free to reach out for deets. These perks are available through any FSPP.",3,1754249892.0,chubbytravel,5,1.0,False

I see so many people do so well on it. I don’t take Wellbutrin but my partner has recently started taking it. She was on it for about a week when she decided it wasn’t for her. Said she couldn’t handle how wired she felt. Even when resting just felt wired.  She also started getting migraines that were pretty rough. And then some jumpy mood swings to top it off.  It wasn’t the most comfortable week for her. Though she did experience her own interest in activities she thinks are fun on her own, which was a great thing!  But these past couple of days after she stopped taking Wellbutrin she started getting dizzy and experiencing nausea. We are on day three as of this morning and she has literally slept 16 hours. This is so not like her.  We went to get coffee as soon as she woke up and groceries and by the time we got home she was so exhausted she went back to sleep.  Is this withdrawal? After only 7 days experiencing physical withdrawal symptoms?  I am worried also because she is an attorney. Her job is so difficult and requires so much thought.
 I just don’t know how she will be able to work.  Any advice/words of wisdom/similar experiences? Anything I can get or do to help?",1,1754249841.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False

Im pretty sure mc was a senior in high-school and her “boyfriend” was like a mechanic (??).  She brings him coffee a lot and her hair being long is a big deal bc of her parents. Her dad owns his building and they don’t find out about their relationship till after he passes im pretty sure. 

edit 1: i remember more im pretty sure her actual boyfriend at the time was abusive and an altercation between them lead the female mc and the like “boyfriend” to meet.

I have a new job/commute and I’m looking for a new work bag. Can you help with some suggestions? My 15L pack without external water bottle holders isn’t large enough most days.

Background: I bike only 1 mile to work, live in a mild climate without snow and occasional rain in the winter. I am a healthcare worker and work at a hospital.

My daily pack:
-32 oz water bottle
-Coffee thermos 
-Lunch bag - foldable, not stiff (also sometimes breakfast so this can require a good amount of space)
-Light jacket 
-Work basics including badge, lanyard, keys
-Personal basics including sunglasses, small wallet, AirPods, house key, phone 
-I could strap my helmet to the bag but it’s not a necessary feature 
-Occasionally I will also bring a binder to and from work 

A backpack or something with backpack straps would be ideal. I have been looking at backpacks and tote packs.

Function is far more important than aesthetics for this but if I could be picky I like either minimalist/clean or outdoorsy looking packs/brands. 

The Bellroy Laneway tote pack seems like it would fit the bill (albeit ridiculously expensive) but it looks like people don’t love them on here. I was originally interested in it because I liked the two internal thermos holders and could use the outside zippers to separate hospital and personal extras. Main compartment for lunch and warm layer.

I’ve also been looking at a Chrome backpack, Patagucci tote pack, Fjallraven. I’m lost - there are too many options! ",1,1754249674.0,ManyBaggers,3,1.0,False

Found this out two days ago and I cant stop thinking about it and need advice. 

I (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating 7 months. We have a lot in common and things have been going well, but a few days ago I found out he's a sperm donor and it makes me feel lied to and I want to break up. Not sure if I'm over reacting to this but it's really changed how I see him.

To preface, I do not want to have kids. Never have, likely never will, for many reasons. A) Being pregnant and birthing a person is literally body horror to me B) children are annoying C) I like having disposable income and time and D) I think bringing more innocent people into this cluster fuck of a world is selfish and irresponsible. Maybe in the future I'll decide to adopt an older kid if I get the urge to nurture something bigger than my dogs, but I don't count on it. Nothing and no one will spawn from my womb, if I could get rid of it I would.

When me and my boyfriend first started going out (met through a mutual friend), I was upfront about my decision to remain childfree, and he said he felt the same. He would agree, rather enthusiastically, to my points.

A few days ago we were watching TV together at his place. I was watching the show and scrolling my phone while he was on his laptop, slightly turned away from me. After a while he set it on the coffee table and went to the bathroom, and I got a quick look at what he was posting.

He was on a Facebook group for sperm donors, giving advice to someone about which banks would take donors multiple times and talking about his experiences there. I didn't get to look at it long before he came back, he didn't notice. 

I don't know how to feel about this. Angry? Looking back, I feel like he was lying to me when we talked about being childfree. Like maybe he was trying to impress me? Convince me he wanted the same thing? It's got me confused. The mature thing would be to bring it up, but I don't know if he would be mad that I looked at his open laptop screen that he left right in my eyeline. But also the idea that he's been been a sperm donor is creepy to me for some reason, I'm getting the ""ick"" thinking about it. But its not like there's gonna be a problem of our future children meeting his donor kids, so it shouldn't matter.

Our relationship has otherwise been fine. We were planning on a trip to Montreal for our one year anniversary. We have the same interests, sex is good, and we (supposedly) had the same wants and beliefs. He's funny and attractive and smart. But this feels like a violation for some reason. I want to break up. I havent brought this up with my friends because how would I even do that. Am I overreacting?

This post is only for those with less than a week left to review.
Reminder: Wag na wag tularan! 😅

Medyo long post ’to—
If your test date is still more than 1–2 weeks away, skip this post!

Background Story:
I was working full-time in a BPO (healthcare) industry on US time while also running small business stores.
A month and a week before my exam, I opened two new stores. At that time, I already had my ATT, but when I checked, I realized the validity was about to expire! With only two weeks left, I had no choice but to book my exam in Alabang—even if I’m from QC (no choice)—and I chose the last day of my ATT as my exam date.

Because I had just opened the stores, all my money was tied up in the business, so I decided not to buy a Qbank, thinking I’d only be able to use it for about two weeks anyway.
Managing two new stores plus my full-time job left me super busy, and I couldn’t even take a leave from work, since leave requests needed to be filed a month in advance.

Review Center:
I enrolled in INAP Review Center, but my last review session with them was way back in January because I got busy (and a bit lazy 😅). But for someone like me, a 2012 graduate, their program was a huge help for fundamentals and concepts!
Sir Hisu—OMG, sobrang galing niya! 🙌

Serious Review (a.k.a. My 3-Day Cram): 
Since I was busy with my businesses, my real, focused review started 3 days before the exam.

What I did:
	•	Klimek Review Episode 1 & 12 (for SATA, prioritization, and delegation)
	•	Dr. Sharon YouTube channel – I spent 3 straight days watching her videos with prayers:
“Lord, sana kung ano’ng maaaral ko kay Dr. Sharon, ‘yun ang lumabas, or at least ma-adopt ko kung paano siya mag-isip.”
I even paired my review with coffee, and listened while working.
My strategy: Question → Pause → Try to answer → Play → Check if we think alike. ✅
	•	ChatGPT – 1 day before my exam, I used it to get summaries for topics I couldn’t cover anymore like Maternal, Pedia, Psych, and Infection Control. This really helped, especially for infection control,maternal and pedia, which I honestly didn’t get to fully study.

I also revisited my notes from INAP (sir Hisu’s MedSurg class)

NCLEX Day:
I had work until 6 AM, so I tried to rest for 2 hours before preparing.
At 9 AM, I traveled to Alabang from QC—praying the entire way.
On the trip, I reviewed:
	•	Klimek Ep 1 (for SATA)
	•	Klimek Ep 12 (for prioritization and delegation)
	•	Notes on Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic s/sx (also for SATA)
	•	A few more notes from Sir Hisu’s class

Even before going up the building, I was still reading—until 11:30 AM.
My exam was at 12 noon.
The only thing I brought with me to the testing room was faith. 🙏

During the Exam
I mentally prepared for 150 questions.
(I read stories of people who lost focus and panicked after 85 Qs, so I set my goal higher.)

I filled my whiteboard with everything I could recall:
Mnemonics like VEAL CHOP, SPIDERMAN, MTV, MRSWEE. Signs & symptoms from Klimek Ep 1, Prioritization from Kllimek 12, Sympathetic & Parasympathetic s/sx for quick SATA and drug related s/sx reference. This method worked for me—it kept me calm and focused whenever I saw a related question. ✅

When I reached 130 questions, I noticed I only had 1 hour left.
But I didn’t rush. Even if I already have an answer, I read the question carefully and used process of elimination every single time.
I always looked for keywords because missing one word can make your answer wrong.
That’s why elimination is super important for all multiple-choice questions. I finished all 150 questions with 15 mins left. 

Result: ✅ I PASSED! 🎉

My Advice:
If you’re a crammer like me, Mark Klimek and Dr. Sharon are the key to success!
At least for me, it worked—but I can’t guarantee it works for everyone. Since I had no other choice and limited time, this was my lifeline. 
They’ll teach you how to think, how to answer difficult questions, and how to use critical thinking and common sense.

Important Reminder:
To those makulit na binasa pa rin ‘to kahit matagal pa exam nyo—
PLEASE wag ako tularan. 😅
Mag-aral kayo lalo na ung mga batch 2019 pababa.
Fundamentals and basic concepts are everything!

💡 NCLEX is a safety exam.
You don’t need to know it all.
You just need to be a safe nurse. 🩺💙

Good Luck future USRNs!

Didnt even call back.

Maybe I made a wrong decision of showing some care, kindness and providing safe space to the needed ones. Now onwards I will let my kindness go in vein but not to someone who is not greatful. 

I am planning to change my phone number and maybe isolate myself from most of the people. And respond to only few of my family and close ones. Is it a good idea? What should I even do in this situation?",1,1754249415.0,Healthygamergg,3,1.0,False

I get home around 10:30, the living room lights are still on, meaning my parents are still awake. I have no idea what I was going to say to them. “Hi mom and dad! I assaulted somebody today, and got stuck with a needle. Did I mention ‘I’ tried to force a girl to kiss me? Anyways, goodnight!” I prayed that they wouldn’t notice anything. I put on my hoodie, and rolled the sleeves over my bandaged hand. I placed my head against the steering wheel, and said

 

“It’s okay, It’s okay, just gotta go in, say hi, and run upstairs to bed. It’ll be over in 10 minutes Earthwor-.” I gasp, and open my eyes.



Not once have I ever referred to myself as “Earthworm” even in my thoughts. I shake it off as the trauma messing with me. I get out of the car, and head inside.    



As I enter, I speed walk to the stairs that are just ahead of me. I pass the entryway to the living room where my mom, and dad are watching true crime cases. I wave my left arm, that is shaking, and say “Hi, mom, hi dad.” and go upstairs. I’m half-way up the stairs before I hear my parents say my name. For some reason I don’t register “Issac” as my name. But, the second time they say it, it clicks for me.

I turn around to see the both of them standing at the bottom.

“Yeah?” I say, trying to hide my right hand as much as possible.

“Why didn’t you stop when we said your name?” My mom says

“Oh, um, sorry, just a long night.” I say

“Are you okay?” My dad says

“Yeah. I’m fine, I promise.”

“Okay. Well, we just wanted to let you know we installed cameras in every room of the house.” My mom says

“You did what?” I say, now noticing a small camera above me, capturing the entirety of the entryway. 

“We’re just worried about someone breaking in, is all. It’s a safety precaution.” My dad says

“You guys need to watch something other than true crime all day.” I say

“If you saw some of the crimes we’ve seen, you’d be doing the same thing, Issac.” My mom says

“Okay, whatever.” I walk up the stairs.



I go into my room, and close the door behind me. I have one of those long mirrors that I placed adjacent to the door.  The first thing you see when you walk into the room is your reflection. 



As I looked at the reflection, “I” felt disgust, hatred, desperation, and anger. But, the most overwhelming feeling was loneliness. I felt like something crucial was missing from me. I didn't know what exactly; all I know is that I needed to find what was missing from me.



I placed a blanket over the mirror for the night. I opened my closest, and put on my pajamas. I walk over to my window, and ensure it's locked. I look over to my wardrobe that’s facing my bed. I see a small camera recording. I don’t feel super comfortable with the idea of being recorded while sleeping, so I cover the camera with a shirt.



 I get into bed, and pull out my phone. Sherry had blocked me on everything. I don’t blame her at all. All I can do is hope she forgives me someday for what “I” did.



That night, my dreams replayed the scene at the party. Over, and over, my mind made me watch as I hit Noah with the bong. I could hear the sound of his skull cracking open like a pistachio, I could hear each, and every individual piece of glass slide into his thin flesh. Over, and over again. 

Then the dream shifts. I’m standing at the bottom of the stairs leading to the plastered door. I’m looking up the stairs. I begin to walk up. 



With each step I feel my feet crumble into worms. First the feet, then my shins, my knees, and finally, my thighs. Once I run out of legs to walk on, I begin to crawl. The worms ooze out of my pelvis, they inch up my body eating everything in their path. I feel my liver fill with worms, I feel my appendix burst into more worms. I feel my heart pump nothing, but worms into my veins, my body, they infest my organs, they replace my bones.



 I reach the top, I have no more arms to crawl with. I only have worms. I can feel them crawl over my face. They start to shred my eyelashes, and burrow themselves in, replacing them. I can’t even see the door anymore, they’ve eaten my eyes.



 I can hear the eggs inside my ears hatch. They plug my ears like water, and begin to eat everything within. I can taste the rubbery, dirt-ridden monsters as they replace my tongue. I can smell their stink as they replace the cartilage of my nose with themselves. 



With the body I have now, I try to fit through the door. The worms don’t want to escape, however. We flop down the steps, where children now wait, eager to devour us. 



I woke up, screaming, making sure there were no worms on my body. I am not in my bed anymore. The blanket over the mirror is on the floor, and I am looking at my reflection. My closet door is wide open, all my clothes are on the floor, my window is wide open, and my bandages are across the floor.



 I let out a few panicked “what the fucks,” and started shoving my clothes back inside my closet. I go over to my window, and look out. There's nothing, but my backyard. I slam my window shut, and lock it once more. Not once have I ever slept walk in my life. I take the bloodied bandages, and shove them into the trash can. I look at my right-hand. It’s healed completely. But, it’s notably paler than the rest of my arm. I look in astonishment. As I do, I notice something near my knuckles. It kinda looks like a wart, but I swear there’s a finger nail on it. My focus was interrupted by a knock on the door. I walk over, and open it. It’s my mom.



“Issac, we heard screaming, are you okay?” She says, I notice bags under her eyes.

“Y-yeah, yeah, sorry I just had a really bad dream.”

“Okay, good, sorry to hear you had a bad dream. I’m sure the dog didn’t help either.”

“The dog?” I say

“Wow, you didn’t hear it? It was barking all night. Poor things throat must’ve given out around hour 6, I think.”

“Maybe it was one of the neighbor’s dogs?” I say

“Maybe, we were going to talk to them about it later today. Come down stairs and have some breakfast, your dads making your favorite.” My mom turns around, and walks down the stairs.



I leave my bedroom, and go downstairs to meet my parents in the kitchen. I can smell my favorite breakfast: an omelet, with sausage mixed in, and home fries. My dad is finishing up breakfast, as my mom sips on her coffee scrolling on her phone. 

“Good morning.” I say to my dad as I take a seat 

“Good morning. Did you sleep okay? ” My dad says as he tends to the omelette.

“Yeah, kinda, just had a bad dream, sorry about the noise.” 

“All good.” My dad says

I couldn’t stop thinking about the state I found my room in when I woke up. Then I remembered the camera.

“Um. Excuse me, I have to use the rest-room.” I stand up and make my way back to my room.

I take the shirt off the camera, which is still recording. I grab onto it, along with my laptop and transfer the footage from the camera, to the laptop. I regret putting my shirt over the camera, but thankfully, I could still hear.

I get some headphones, and begin to listen. From 11-1:30 there’s no sound at all. But, around 1:45 I began to hear the dog barking. The barks were hoarse, like it had been gargling rocks all day.



3 hours go by of nothing, but barking. Then, I hear my bed shift, and my covers move. I hear the floor creak, and footsteps making their way over to my closet, I think. I hear it open; I then hear the clatter of my cloth hangers clash against each other. I hear my clothes get placed off the hooks, then I hear footsteps again. I hear a blanket fall to the ground. There’s a moment in between them leaving the hooks, and hitting the ground that makes me think that I’m looking at the shirts in the mirror. 



Another hour goes by of this process repeating. And, when I am out of clothes, the footsteps move over to the window. I hear it open up, the barks get even louder. I don’t hear any footsteps for another hour. I’m just listening to the dog bark. I then hear my bandages fall to the ground, and a “sqwelching” sound. I move once again over to my window. The dog is still barking. As I watch the final hours my eyes begin to tear up. I swear the dog is saying “Sherry” over, and over, and over again.



I then hear my own screams, and concurrent “what the fucks.”  



I pause the footage and close my laptop. I stare forward, blankly, wondering what in God’s name is wrong with me. I then feel something wiggling on my right hand. I look down to see the wort has grown, and the fingernail is starting to squirm back and forth. Like a worm trying to dig out of the ground. 



I reach for it, and try to pull it out. The agony is unreal, It feels like a lumberjack’s saw is tearing through my bone, and skin. The nail refuses to come out, like someone is on the other end pulling just as much as I am. 



I get up, and make my way to the garage, where my dad keeps his tools. I open up one of the drawers and grab onto pliers. I pinch the nail and pull as hard as I possibly can. The adrenaline muffles the pain. And with a “pop,” the nail is removed. 



I throw the nail into the garbage. I then look at where it breached my skin. The wound is bleeding so much that I can barely see it. My dad runs into the garage.

“Issac! What happened? Are you okay?” 

“Yeah, sorry, um, I just wanted to remove a wart.”

“Don’t use tools to do that! Especially when you don’t ask. It could get infected, go upstairs, and clean yourself up.” My dad storms off.

“Sorry, dad.” 



I try to not bleed all over the floor as I make my way up to the bathroom. I lock the door, I begin to wash the wound over water, the blood mixes with the water and flows into the drain. I get a better look at my wound, and it terrifies me. I can see something moving within. It’s white, and smooth, It’s a bone. It’s squirming as if it’s feeling the same amount of pain that I am. It moves independently from me, but I can feel my brain sending signals to it. I can feel my brain reacting to the pain just like any other wound.  



 I begin to search through the medicine cabinet, grabbing onto the peroxide. I uncap it, and brace myself. I pour the peroxide over the open wound. As it sizzles my skin, I grit my teeth, and clench my fist. After it is done, I place the cap back on, and place it on the sink. I look as the bubbles begin to foam over my wounded hand. While watching, I noticed something. All of my knuckles are growing fingernails.



“Mom! Dad!” I scream out

 I go to open the door but I'm stopped. My hand is inches away from the door lock,  but something is holding me back. Something begins to boil within me, it’s anger, froth inducing anger. Only directed to one thing in the room. Me. I see as my own hand snaps back, reaching towards the sink. I try to pull away using my own weight, but I feel like my arm is going to pop out of its socket if I continue to pull. I stumble forward to the sink. My hand uncaps the peroxide, and begins to move to my mouth. I use my other hand to stop it. 

	“Stop!” I scream as I struggle to stop my own arm from getting closer to my mouth. But, my other arm betrays me, it stops resisting. Instead, it squeezes the bottom of my jaw, trying to force it open. I push my head downwards, closing my mouth just enough for my teeth to guard the rest of my mouth. I can hear my parents race up the stairs. 



My right hand releases my jaw, and pulls my hair back. I fall backwards, and slam up against the ceramic walls. It then places itself over my forehead, and slams my head over, and over again against the walls. I can hear the cracking of the ceramic, and my skull, as a warm liquid slides down my neck. I lose all energy to fight back, as my mouth is pried open, and the peroxide is poured into my mouth. I can feel it bubbling, and burning inside. My mouth fills with foam. I want to throw up, but my hands force my mouth shut. I begin to choke, and I’m forced to swallow it. I can feel the peroxide go all the way down my esophagus, and splash into my stomach. Some of it goes down my wind pipe, and burns my [lungs.My](http://lungs.My) hands release, and are now back under my control. I fall to my side.

   

I begin coughing relentlessly, my voice pathetically tries to scream for help. I made the mistake of throwing up. I feel the acid travel all the way back up my esophagus, and it returns to my mouth to burn it all over again. My parents begin to bash on the door.

“Issac! Isaac! Are you okay!?” My dad says as I hear him kick on the door. 



The room was blurry, and spinning all around me, blood was coalescing on the floor as I saw the large hole the back of my head had made in the wall. I use the sink to pull myself up. I look into the mirror. My mouth is covered in foam, and blood, my hair is stained with red. The feeling of loneliness comes over me again. I hate what I am seeing. I can’t stand to look at it anymore. The last thing I remember is my face heading towards the mirror. 



I weakly open up my eyes. A respirator has been placed over my mouth, A textured material is covering the right side of my face, and hurts like nothing i’ve ever felt before. The lights are way too bright, and I have a migraine. I am on a bed with the sound of beeping, and an I.V in my arm. My parents are sitting just across from me. 

“Mom? Dad?” I say

They immediately stand up, my dad starts calling for the doctor as my mom runs over to me crying.

“Oh, my baby, I’m so glad you’re okay.” 

“I don’t…what happened?” 

“Don’t worry about that right now, just relax, okay?” 

There is nothing else I can do, but lie on the bed. The doctor rushes in, It’s Dr. Hart. She goes up to me.

“Issac? Can you hear me, sweetie?” She says

I nod my head

“Good. You suffered a severe concussion, Issac. We had to pump your stomach, extract glass from your face, and staple the back of your head. We’re going to give you something for the pain, and we need you to change your wraps every 8 hours. Do you understand?”

I nod my head

“That's great. One second.” Dr. Hart looks over to my parents. “Could I talk to you two in the hallway?” 

“Uh, yeah, sure” my dad says, as they both follow her outside.

I can’t hear what they are saying, I begin to feel the material over my face, praying that I will wake up from this nightmare at any moment. The doctor returns alone.

“Hi, Issac, I just need to ask you a few questions, do you think you can answer them, right now?” 

“Y-yeah, I think so.” My voice croaks like I’ve been smoking cigars for 60 years.

“Good. It won’t be a lot.” She pulls out a clipboard “Have you taken any substance within the last 48 hours?” 

“No.” she writes something down.

“Okay, have you had a history of suicidal thoughts, or actions?” 

“Um…no.” she writes again.

“Have you ever had a history of violent thoughts, or actions before?

“No. Well, only in self defense.”

“Okay.” she writes once again.

“Do you remember anything that has happened within the last 24 hours?”

“Only what happened in my bathroom.” I say

“Okay. You don’t remember rambling about yourself, or anything like that?” 

“No…what happened to me?” I shakily say. She places the clipboard down on a table next to her

“Honey, I’m going to show you something, and I need you to remain calm, okay? Can you do that for me?” She says as she places her hand over my bandaged left hand.

I nod in anticipation.

“Okay.” She begins to unwrap the bandages, the bandages stick gently to the scabbed flesh of my hand. What she reveals nearly made me pass out.



I have 5 new fingers. They reach out uncontrollably, as if they are trying to escape the confines of my hand.



I try to scream, but only a pathetic hoarse bellow exits my throat. I whip my hand back and forth trying to shake them off, but to no avail. They are a part of me just as the rest of my fingers are. 



“What…what the fuck…” I scream as I begin to cry.

The Dr stands up, and stops my hand.

“Shhh, it’s okay, it’s okay.”

“It’s not okay! What’s happening to me?” 

“We are running tests, don’t worry, panicking will make it worse.”

“It can be worse than this!?” I say as I flail my new fingers.

“Yes…unfortunately. We ran some blood tests on you, and we found something in your system. It’s some sort of…parasitic cancer. It's bonding with your DNA, and your cells, it starts duplicating, then modifying them. We’ve never seen anything like this before.”

I don’t respond for a second, just taking in all that is happening with me. 

“W-what am I supposed to do?” I say

“You’re positive that you didn’t take any substance, at all, Issac?”

“N-” I stop as I remember what had happened at the party. I may have stopped Noah. But, the needle still pierced me.

“Yes, yes I did, not on purpose, and not a lot, but I did.” I say

“What was it?” She quickly grabs her clipboard and turns it to the blank side. 

“I don’t know. I thought it was heroin, but Noah said it wasn't heroin.”

“Where did you take this?”

“I didn’t take it, it was forced onto me.” 

“*Where* did you take this!? The Doctor demands

“It was at a frat house. 51 paddington ave.” 

She writes down the address

“Okay, thank you, we are going to send a hazmat team there. I’m sorry this is happening to you. But, we will do everything we can for you.”

“Thank you, Doctor.” 

She gives me a smile, and begins to wrap my hand’s back up, including my new fingers.  

“Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.” 



The doctor leaves the room, and I am reunited with my parents. They stayed with me for the rest of the day, and that night “I” woke up to the sound of banging on the window. “My” parents are sound asleep in the chairs, and couches that are available in the patient room.



“I” looked over to see a human hand, and a dog paw pressed up against the glass window. “I’m” not afraid. “I” am relieved. The consciousness is beginning to form. The hands slowly lower back behind the window. 



“I” walked over to the window, stumbling on the way. It was as if “I” was taking my very first steps. “I” slid open the window to see Poochie. 



She’s grown quite a bit, almost to our height. She’s still getting used to walking like a person. She looks like a deer on its hind legs. Promisingly though, her new arms are starting to grow nicely. Thumbs and fingernails protrude from the sides of her paws; while the new bones in her hind legs are starting to form proper human feet. Most promising though is her new head. It is growing nicely. The facial features are smoothed over, and appear dough-like. Soon It will have blue eyes, ginger hair, and even fleshy glasses.  But, it still has some of her features. The growing teeth are a mix of canines, and humans. And, the nasal bone is growing out to be a snout. It is not perfect, but it is good enough, for now. 



“I” step out of the window,  and begin to pet her. I use my other hands to close the window making sure my other pair of legs are out of the way of the window.  



“S-S-herrrryy…yyy, where arrrree yyyouuu” Poochie whimpers

“Shhh, we’ll find her soon. We have to hurry to the house, he could awake at any moment.” 



Poochie, and “I” begin to walk away from the hospital. We enter the forest since it’s the quickest way to get back to the house. Just as “I” was getting used to walking again. I wake up screaming.

The abomination next to me runs off, and into the bushes where I lose sight of it. I trip on my own legs. I look down to see an additional pair have started to grow from my hips. They have bulbous growths emerging from them. They expand and deflate randomly. I poke them. They are tender, and upon contact ooze out some sort of creamy substance. The ooze begins to melt my finger tip away. I see my finger scab over, form a scar, and fade the scar away. All in the matter of seconds.    



My head begins to throb, like someone is trying to shout their way out of my skull. I grab onto my head in pain, then feel another set of hands touch my head. I slowly let go of my head to see that the new fingers that I had have now grown into a pair of arms. They too have strange growths all over them. But, I can move them as if they were my own. 



I break mentally. I honestly hoped that there was a mountain lion nearby that would rip my throat out. But, no animal would want to come anywhere near the sound that thing was making.

“Sherrryy…I l-l-lov-ee you.” 

I can’t run, the new legs keep getting tangled with my old ones. I can only crawl. The additional pair of arms aided in my escape. I search desperately for some sort of cliff, or road that has a sleep-deprived driver behind the wheel. I’d even take a wasps nest, I could throw a rock at it and have them attack me. Stinging me into the end of this life, and whatever other life resides within me. 

But, no such blessing comes my way. I can hear it around me, I can feel it’s 4 eyes piercing me. 

“Wwwheerreee areee youuuuuu.” 

I collapse in exhaustion. Every breath is hell without a respirator. I can hear its footsteps move through the bushes, walking over twigs coming closer to me. I can feel it’s hot breath on my neck, and on my back. 

“Iiii…Iiii lovveee youuuuu” 

I turn around, and try to fight the thing off. I thought having multiple arms would be an advantage, but they were too exhausted to do anything. Its canine head has twisted upside down. It looks like a diabetic's leg. And its other head looks like a finger that’s lost circulation.



It grabs my legs, and starts to drag me through the woods. It makes sure to go over large rocks, it’s trying to knock me out. It jumps over a fallen tree, in which I grab onto it with all my arms. I can feel my ligaments, nerves, bones, flesh, and skin tear off of my legs.

I do everything in my power to stay conscious, but it's too much for my body to handle. The last thing I see is the thing's heads snap around, and rush back at me.   



Poochie walks up to me, sniffing my legs. She whines, clearly feeling bad.

“I’mmm sorrrrry….yyyyy.”  

“It’s okay, they’ll grow back.” “I” pet Poochie, and wrap “my” arms around her. “I” lay atop her back, I can see where the new vertebrae are starting to form on her back, and smile. 

She rushes off. And, we finally made it back home. 



The house has been abandoned, and the windows are covered by plywood. Poochie and “I” walk up to one of the windows and rip the plywood off. 

“Good. Let’s hurry.” Poochie jumps through the window and we make our way to the plastered door. We open it up, and go down the stairs. 

“I” am relieved to see that the cops missed the door during their investigation. Painting the door the same color as the wall was a stroke of genius on “my” part. “My” equipment, notes, and ingredients are still all intact. My legs have reformed to the point where “I” could walk on them normally. “I” got off Poochie and walked over to the table where “I” kept my notes. 

“Good. Good. Poochie. C’mere.” she crawls her way to me.

“Just follow these notes, they’re everything you’ll need to finish the substance.” 

Poochie looks at the table in confusion, but I am more than confident that the part of me inside of her will take over and do all the work. 

“He’ll come back soon, girl, he’ll ruin all of my work. I can’t let that happen.” “I” walk over to the rusty dog cage in the corner, and lock myself inside. 

“As soon as you’re done, inject me with it.” 



I awake in some sort of cellar with lab equipment. The scent of dog piss, and weed assaults my nostrils once again. I’m locked in a rusty dog cage. I can’t get out. The thing is going back and forth from the equipment to scattered pieces of paper on a table. The concoction it’s brewing bubbles, and sizzles. And it looks upon its work with pride. 



 It finishes what it was creating. It sticks a needle in a small bottle, and retrieves a brackish substance from it. It’s gotten more used to using its human side. The head looks like Noah’s. As It walks over to me, syringe in hands. It says a new phrase. 

“It won’t hurt.”



The needle slides into my skin and makes contact with a vein. I can feel the sludgey substance enter my veins. It slowly begins to make itself through my entire body. There is a moment of time before it reaches my heart that I am aware of what is about to happen to me. The thing that created this concoction opens up the dog cage, I crawl my way out, but it’s no use. As it reaches my heart I begin to convulse violently.



Foam begins to secrete from my mouth as tumors grow all around my body. With the slightest touch they explode violently and release a cream-colored substance all around the lab. My additional arms begin to free themselves from the confines of my arms, and tear themselves slowly up my arms. It feels like someone has dug their nails into my arms and is pulling my flesh like it’s duct tape. The extra arms stop once they reach my shoulders. 



My legs do the same, where my new legs, and old legs connect are slowly torn apart like someone splitting a log with their bare hands. I try to stand with them, but, just like a new born deer, my ankles snap on themselves. 

   

 

  
  


My liver screams in pain as I feel the nerves dig into it. Tumors begin to grow over it, and with a muffled burst I can feel a new one form. The same occurs with my kidneys, my lungs, and my heart. I can feel my heart beating up against the new one, and my lungs are not in rhythm with my new ones. I can feel all of my organs smoosh up against each other. My ribs break from the pressure. They stab into my heart’s and lung’s, but, thankfully, tumors begin to grow over my heart’s, lung’s, and ankle’s. I feel something burst within me, and just like that, all the pain is gone. 

My body is not able to hold itself up more given the amount of new organs, and weight that’s been put on it. To accommodate, my spine snaps in two, and duplicates. The additional vertebrae will help keep me upright, and the new nerves make their way to the new organs that are forming within me. They squirm within me like a cluster of worms. My destroyed ribs grow new ones to protect my organs like a shell. 



I try to scream, but the tumors fill my mouth, I accidentally bite into one, and whatever they are filled with squirts into the back of my throat. It’s warm. It tastes like expired milk, and feels like coagulated blood. My jaw erratically shifts from side to side, it’s making room for the new teeth that are emerging from my gums. My teeth squeeze together like someone has put them through a vice grip. My tongue explodes into mush, and reforms into a forked tongue that can move independently from one another. 



My eyes are split like a cracked egg, and duplicate. I can see better than before, and it makes me watch the rest of my body transform. The new vertebrae shoot up into my skull, and I can feel a new brain forming. 



 My brain cells start to fry like they’ve been put into an electric chair. Someone else's memories flood my brain. I think thoughts that I have no intention of crafting. The most prominent ones are “Where is Sherry?” “I’m sorry” and “I love you” over, and over, and over again. I rethink the memory of kissing Sherry, and how much joy it brings me. I remember the news of my oncoming death, the desperation I felt upon hearing the words “you are going to die” come from the doctor's mouth. I remember the years of obsessive study of the human body, mind, and soul and how they can become one with another.

 

 I can feel each and every complex system that a human brain holds form rapidly. And, upon the final knit of the nerves connecting to one another, my heart’s slow down, I catch all my breaths. My body is now in perfect rhythm. I cannot control my body anymore, but that’s okay, someone else has taken them over for me. 



We stand up. Our legs wobble a bit, but we get used to it quickly. Our hands grab onto a mirror. We can see details that a singular set of eyes would miss. We can see the small mites that eat at our skin, and eyelashes. Our hair is a blend of brown, and orange, and a small beard is beginning to form nicely. One of the faces looks to be in complete terror. It may have gone insane, but that was expected. The amygdala should be repressed soon, then it will feel nothing but joy. This could not have gone any better.



With our new set of ears, we can hear two men pulling up in a car outside the house. They are talking about Issac escaping, and to see if they can find our concoction. We can’t help but smile from two ears all the way to the other set. With two brains, making our “Vitruvian” concoction air-borne should be no problem at all. And the gentlemen who just entered the house will be the perfect test subjects. 



Epilogue



I’m still here. Locked away deep inside the confines of my own body. I don’t know if Noah intended for my consciousness to still be present at all, but it is. I'm not in control, I don’t even think Noah is either. Something foreign and entirely new controls our bodies. 



I couldn’t help but watch as “I” or “we” tore those poor police officers apart. They actually landed a shot at Noah’s head, but the bullet did nothing. The tumors grew over the hole the bullet left behind, and healed it immediately.  Unexpectedly, the cop had hit the tumors healing Noah’s face, and the cream substance sprayed out and began to melt the cops face.  We peer over his twitching body, and examine the acid. It is not an unwelcome surprise. 



Poochie subdued the other police officer by injecting him with something. Poochie did all of this while screaming about Sherry. She dragged them to the cage. We will start experimenting on them soon. 



I think the worst part of all of this, the thing that still scares me, even though my amygdala is suppressed. Is the fact that Noah was right.



It doesn’t hurt. I don’t feel alone anymore, and I never will again. Everyone will feel this way. We walk over to the lab to begin modifying the Vitruvian serum when we see a photo of Sherry. She’s walking home, we took this picture when she wasn’t looking. She shouldn’t have to feel alone anymore. She’s our other h



“I” have become “we” and We will become All.

1mgs503,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mgs503/should_you_buy_the_best_coffee_maker_kidisle/,Should You Buy the Best Coffee Maker KIDISLE KC311 for Travel?,"The moment I started using the KIDISLE KC311, my coffee routine took a fresh and exciting turn. This sleek grey coffee maker sits compactly on my countertop, its modern design complementing my kitchen setup. Standing at a convenient 11 inches tall and 5.3 inches wide, it saves space without compromising functionality. Whether I needed a quick brew before heading out or an iced coffee to cool down, the versatility of this machine left a lasting impression.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing to catch the eye is how well-thought-out the design of this coffee maker is. Its compact form factor means it doesn’t monopolize valuable counter space, making it perfect for small apartments or crowded kitchens like mine. I appreciated the travel mug compatibility, which allowed me to directly fill my 6.7-inch mug without juggling separate containers. The grey modern finish not only looked clean but resisted fingerprints, keeping it stylish even after frequent use.

[Grab KIDISLE KC311 at the best price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0dk2xhsr4/)

**Ease of Use**

Operating this coffee maker is effortless, even for those who aren't tech-savvy. The one-touch brewing option had my coffee ready in minutes, which turned out to be a lifesaver on rushed mornings. Loading a K-Cup or using the included reusable filter for ground coffee made brewing flexible and convenient. While both methods worked seamlessly, it was the reusable filter that won me over for its eco-friendliness and ability to unlock a broader range of coffee flavors.

**Features That Shine**

One of the standout features is the 2-in-1 brewing flexibility. Choosing between K-Cup pods or ground coffee gave me more control over my daily caffeine fix. On days I craved something refreshing, the iced coffee setting was a game changer. The bold coffee option provided that extra kick I often needed to power through a busy workload. Both settings delivered consistently satisfying results with just a press of a button.

Additionally, the auto-shutoff feature came in handy more times than I can count. Forgetting to turn off coffee machines used to be a bad habit of mine, but this feature ensured safety and energy efficiency without any extra effort on my part.

**Maintenance Made Easy**

As much as I love coffee, cleaning coffee makers isn’t my favorite task. That’s where this device surprised me. After 150 uses, the descale reminder kicked in, which was a practical touch I appreciated. Activating self-cleaning mode was as simple as holding down the Iced Coffee button for three seconds. This innovative feature helped extend the machine's lifespan, kept the taste of the coffee untainted, and saved me time on upkeep.

**Benefits**

- Compact design perfectly fits even in smaller spaces.  
- Multiple brewing options: K-Cups or ground coffee.  
- Self-cleaning functionality simplifies maintenance.  

**Critiques**

- The 6.7-inch travel mug capacity might not accommodate larger mugs.  
- It can be slightly noisy during brewing compared to other coffee makers.  

**Product Competitors**

Looking at other options in the market, the KIDISLE KC311 stands out for several reasons. Compared to a popular single-serve machine like Keurig K-Mini, this coffee maker’s inclusion of features like a bold coffee setting and self-cleaning mode gives it an edge. While Nespresso Vertuo excels in delivering specialty coffees, it doesn’t offer the same reusable filter versatility, which is helpful when you want to cut down on pod waste. However, those seeking a quieter operation might find Keurig’s models to be a better fit.

**Quality for Price**

Considering the range of features and its reliable performance, the cost feels well justified. In comparison to more premium models, the KIDISLE KC311 more than holds its own by offering advanced settings and flexibility. It provides excellent bang for the buck while maintaining a stylish and efficient design, making it an excellent choice for coffee enthusiasts who appreciate a good value.

any tight clothes or applied pressure would make me have hives in that part of the body

I’m (23M) reaching out today because I’ve been in pain for a few days now, and I’m going through something I’ve never experienced before. It’s incredibly frustrating and unsettling for me.

Let me explain the situation in detail. On Wednesday evening, I went to an Indian restaurant. After eating, I didn’t have anything else for several hours—I had plenty of time to digest. Later that evening, I drank some vodka mixed with Pepsi. It’s worth noting that I almost never drink alcohol because I dislike both the taste and the effects.

A few minutes after drinking, I started vomiting. It was mostly saliva and stomach acid. I ended up having 11 separate vomiting episodes: 7 in the sink and 4 into a container placed on the coffee table next to the couch. Every time, I had to go from lying down to sitting up in order to vomit. The muscle contractions were extremely intense—unlike anything I’ve experienced before. I clearly felt my back contract very forcefully. Don’t’ know if it was the food or the alcohol.

Less than 24 hours later, I developed excruciating lower back pain. It’s so bad that I can’t walk, sneeze, cough, sit, or even lie down comfortably without having intense pain. Every movement feels like torture.

I’ve been taking Tylenol, anti-inflammatories, and even Dilaudid, but nothing is helping—it’s not getting any better. According to ChatGPT, this might be normal and could take up to two weeks to resolve, but I really want to hear from people who may have gone through something similar. I just want to be sure it’s not something irreversible.

1mgs1tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mgs1tv/update_i_miss_my_exboyfriend/,UPDATE - I miss my ex-boyfriend,"It’s been two months since my first post, (not exactly two months, but we agreed to meet the first of August, so yesterday. Writing this now while I remember everything), which you can see on my profile, and three months since the break up (again, not exactly), and we’ve done the meet-up that I mentioned. Also, I’m fully moved out and living with my friend. I wanted to give an update in case anyone was curious

Before I get into how it went, I want to thank the comments on my first post. You didn’t let me get my hopes up about him staying in my life. I always would’ve understood if he didn’t want to, and I always would’ve respected his decision, even if it hurt. Instead of going in and it hurting more that he wouldn’t want to stay in my life after I hoped for it, I went in without an expectation. I didn’t assume the worst, but I tried to not have an expectation

We decided not to talk for about three months. I figured that was enough time for me to figure myself out fully and completely, and I needed to do that while not talking to him. Even if I came out of it not a lesbian, I don’t think we would’ve gotten back together. So the three months gave him time to start the healing process. Then at our meet-up, we would talk about how we found life without each other, and I would share if I figured myself out. That was always the plan - because he also said that he couldn’t see a life without me

Now, the update. The first thing I did was confirm my sexuality, that I’m a lesbian, and I apologized for stealing six years of his life, basically everything I said at the end of my last post. He surprised me with his response. He said that the six years weren’t a waste, that he didn’t regret a single moment of our time spent together. He said I was his best friend before, and I always was his best friend, that he didn’t just lose a girlfriend (I accidentally left out the fact that we were friends for about two years before getting together in my last post). He said that he always saw me as more than just his girlfriend, that I was my own person outside of being his girlfriend, and that I’m now a person outside of being his ex. He said that I helped him become the person he is, that I gave him a safe space to learn and grow. He said he wouldn’t trade the years for anything

I didn’t know what to say to that. I was just silent. As much as I didn’t want to go in with any expectations, I was still expecting him to resent me, and maybe he does and doesn’t want to tell me, but that meant more than I could imagine

He knows me well, so I think he knew I didn’t have a response, and he kept talking. He said that he did research on lesbians, on comphet, sexuality, all of it. He wanted to understand me, he said he didn’t want to be that guy who acted like a jerk just because he didn’t understand. He said he obviously wouldn’t understand fully, but he thinks he has a good grasp. I said that he didn’t have to do that, and he said that he wanted to be the best friend he could for me

After that discussion, I told him my revelations that he was my best friend, and just how important that was to me. Also listed in my previous post (sorry, just don’t want to repeat myself, haha). He said he came to that conclusion, too, but he does still have romantic feelings for me. He says he‘s not ready for me to be fully back in his life yet, which is completely understandable, and that he wants a few more months, or however long it takes, to keep going  with the healing process and to try to get over me. He said that if I’m down, we can meet up once a month for coffee or lunch, and slowly build on our friendship more and slowly bring each other back in our lives, as it wouldn’t be healthy to interact like we used to immediately, and I agreed

I don’t think there will be another update, so another thank you to the comments. Not sure how to end this post, haha, so this is the end",3,1754249165.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. 🙂

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, wherever it leads, friendship or something with sparks.

A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase. 

Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on. 

""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""

Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out. 

On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat. 

This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee. 

Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him. 

His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside. 

With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family. 

At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression. 

The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her. 

Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain. 

""Tracy!""

""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""

As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel. 

The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""

Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""

Erica flipped out immediately. 

""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""

Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather. 

""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""

With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in. 

""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her. 

In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton. 

""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""

Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised. 

She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant. 

There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class. 

Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted. 

Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs. 

Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her. 

""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind. 

""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply. 

She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""

Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier. 

""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""

The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""

Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door. 

""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""

Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke. 



Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle

Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves. 

""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower. 

She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off. 

A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately. 

It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner. 

He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later. 

Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed. 

He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed. 

The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""

Rupert froze completely. 

This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl... 

It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms. 

Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby. 

He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""

Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real. 

The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened. 

Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage. 

Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman. 

Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""

The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest. 

She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""

Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""

Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room? 

She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""

""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible? 

Was every member of this family mad and troublesome? 

""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her. 

In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""

A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night. 

Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes. 

Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's. 

Annabel squinted at him with a smile. 

""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""

Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""

Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation. 

This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other. 

Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out. 

Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""

""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all. 

In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours. 

But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see. 



Chapter 3 New Secretary

Annabel walked away with a fake smile. 

Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""

Just then, Rupert walked out of the room. 

""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear. 

Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more. 

Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast. 

Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table. 

Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""

Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""

She would never make breakfast for this family. 

Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either. 

The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel. 

""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""

To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary. 

Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner. 

There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work. 

She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account. 

A text message from Leonard came through. 

""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""

Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""

Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""

Annabel couldn't believe her eyes. 

Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside. 

""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips. 

""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently. 

""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""

Annabel was amused by his words. 

""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""

Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men. 

Rupert pulled a long face at her words. 

She would never fall for him? 

""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""

In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife? 

Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""

Rupert kept in silent. 

Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside. 

The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion. 

""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""

""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""

""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""

The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them. 



Chapter 4  His Superwoman

""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""

""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""

""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""

""How is that possible? It can't be!""

Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time. 

It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel. 

People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous? 

While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her. 

""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented. 

Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""

Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""

Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel. 

""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""

With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left. 

The others surrounded Nina again. 

""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""

A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks—a young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day. 

As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar. 

In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""

Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today. 

Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""

He would take delight in her suffering. 

The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel. 

A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place. 

Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""

Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""

Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped. 

""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""

Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous. 

He hugged Annabel excitedly. 

""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""

Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""

""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""

Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least. 

The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head. 

Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him? 

Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on? 

The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago. 

At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home. 

Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance. 

Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman. 

She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey. 

It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem. 



Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad

The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly. 

Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion. 

He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order. 

Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her. 

It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours. 

Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""

""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly. 

Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot. 

""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""

""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""

""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""

Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""

Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""

She then went back to work. 

Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work. 

By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""

Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""

Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree. 

Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in. 

""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""

It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence. 

""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed. 

Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion. 

Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""

In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier. 

During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time. 

When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine. 

Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them. 

""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""

Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other. 

Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""

Marcel spat out a mouthful of water. 

""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""

Annabel nodded casually. 

The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was. 

She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world. 

""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief. 

""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly. 

Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""

Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him. 

He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense! 

""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""

""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly. 

They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell. 

""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""

Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""

She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute. 

He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else.""",1,1754248878.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. 🙂

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through.

But it was still in South Jersey so Im using it.

A few years back, maybe 2018. I was working at the Dunkin in Ocean City. (not the one on the boardwalk, the stand alone store) and let me tell you if you went there well before this story all I can say you're welcome. We had the perfect team. No GM at the time. 2 people living in a half way house. 2 lgbtqia members, a nervous wreck and that one new person who never seemed to fit in but stuck around, so we knew how to run a Dunkin and give you at least a 6 out of 10 cup of coffee. (at least for morning shift no one cared about night shift).

Anyway it was early spring. the area was still dead as dirt. To the point we could make trips to the McDonald next door and then sit and eat our food. So one early afternoon we get a call from the district manager telling us Hey, close down the store and start cleaning everything with bleach, like go ham on it. Of course we are very confused because even during high tide where the store is under a foot of water they wouldn't close.

So we start to clean and I notice outside there is a van blocking one of the entrances and a cop car blocking the other. Which again....we found a little weird. I was the first one off so I left and went to pick up my roommate. As I was waiting the district manager called me and was like ""Hey, I just wanted to let you know one of the coworkers was found to have Hepatitis C. So tomorrow everyone needs to come in and get a shot. Looking back I should of been a bit more upset, But it was like ""sure kay""

The next morning we all go and we are in the back and we all get our shots. then of course they want to open. So me and another person stay. Back then (not sure if they do it now) once in a while we were allowed to get food from the Domino's by using store money or swapping foods. Because of this and us saying we would stay the Distrct manger let us get food and well $130 worth of pizza, pasta and wings did seem like a good apologize to us.

NOW the fun. It was pretty clear that Dunkin was trying to hide this cause if word got out about a worker having Hep C, then it would really hurt. So what do I and the other person see as we are enjoying some bread sticks? Chanel 6 Action News! and by the end of the day word had spread. Customers slowed to a crawl for the next few weeks. Like it was bad. If I remember police stopped getting their coffee there, never saw kids. Of course with Summer around the corner (also that person was let go) people forgot and soon the place was it's crowded annoying self once more.

For a little side information. 1. At least back then (might be different now) You needed to take 2 shots. the one we took, then a booster later. We of course never got the booster, so I might be dying as I type this who knows. ALSO the person who had Hep C, her boyfriend worked at the store in Marmora (which I have so many stories about that place) and Dunkin never did a thing. they kept that store open and didn't do shit because no one knew her boyfriend worked there. Another thing that really sucked was we could not say who had it. So the workers who lived in OC at the time were getting a lot of dirty looks cause people just assumed they were the ones.

But yeah. So Im curious anyone just got some good juicy work related stories?",1,1754248825.0,SouthJersey,0,0.6,False

Chapter 1 The Benton Family

A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase. 

Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on. 

""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""

Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out. 

On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat. 

This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee. 

Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him. 

His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside. 

With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family. 

At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression. 

The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her. 

Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain. 

""Tracy!""

""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""

As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel. 

The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""

Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""

Erica flipped out immediately. 

""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""

Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather. 

""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""

With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in. 

""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her. 

In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton. 

""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""

Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised. 

She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant. 

There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class. 

Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted. 

Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs. 

Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her. 

""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind. 

""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply. 

She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""

Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier. 

""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""

The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""

Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door. 

""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""

Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke. 



Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle

Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves. 

""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower. 

She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off. 

A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately. 

It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner. 

He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later. 

Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed. 

He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed. 

The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""

Rupert froze completely. 

This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl... 

It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms. 

Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby. 

He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""

Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real. 

The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened. 

Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage. 

Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman. 

Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""

The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest. 

She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""

Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""

Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room? 

She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""

""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible? 

Was every member of this family mad and troublesome? 

""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her. 

In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""

A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night. 

Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes. 

Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's. 

Annabel squinted at him with a smile. 

""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""

Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""

Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation. 

This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other. 

Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out. 

Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""

""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all. 

In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours. 

But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see. 



Chapter 3 New Secretary

Annabel walked away with a fake smile. 

Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""

Just then, Rupert walked out of the room. 

""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear. 

Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more. 

Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast. 

Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table. 

Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""

Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""

She would never make breakfast for this family. 

Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either. 

The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel. 

""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""

To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary. 

Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner. 

There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work. 

She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account. 

A text message from Leonard came through. 

""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""

Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""

Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""

Annabel couldn't believe her eyes. 

Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside. 

""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips. 

""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently. 

""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""

Annabel was amused by his words. 

""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""

Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men. 

Rupert pulled a long face at her words. 

She would never fall for him? 

""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""

In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife? 

Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""

Rupert kept in silent. 

Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside. 

The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion. 

""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""

""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""

""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""

The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them. 



Chapter 4  His Superwoman

""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""

""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""

""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""

""How is that possible? It can't be!""

Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time. 

It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel. 

People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous? 

While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her. 

""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented. 

Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""

Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""

Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel. 

""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""

With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left. 

The others surrounded Nina again. 

""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""

A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks—a young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day. 

As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar. 

In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""

Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today. 

Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""

He would take delight in her suffering. 

The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel. 

A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place. 

Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""

Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""

Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped. 

""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""

Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous. 

He hugged Annabel excitedly. 

""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""

Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""

""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""

Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least. 

The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head. 

Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him? 

Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on? 

The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago. 

At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home. 

Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance. 

Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman. 

She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey. 

It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem. 



Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad

The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly. 

Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion. 

He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order. 

Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her. 

It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours. 

Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""

""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly. 

Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot. 

""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""

""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""

""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""

Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""

Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""

She then went back to work. 

Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work. 

By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""

Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""

Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree. 

Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in. 

""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""

It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence. 

""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed. 

Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion. 

Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""

In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier. 

During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time. 

When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine. 

Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them. 

""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""

Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other. 

Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""

Marcel spat out a mouthful of water. 

""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""

Annabel nodded casually. 

The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was. 

She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world. 

""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief. 

""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly. 

Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""

Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him. 

He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense! 

""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""

""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly. 

They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell. 

""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""

Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""

She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute. 

He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else.""",1,1754248781.0,novellovers,0,1.0,False
1mgrttq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgrttq,Easy Sourdough Cookie Bars Kids Love,"So I tried something new this weekend and surprised myself. I had this leftover sourdough starter sitting in the back of my fridge—you know, because I \*thought\* I was going to bake sourdough bread all the time, but life happened. Anyway, I hated the idea of wasting it, so I started looking into what else I could do. Enter: sourdough cookie bars.



I found the idea while scrolling and thought, ""Hey, sourdough in cookies? Is that even going to be good?"" Not gonna lie, I was super skeptical. But it turned out to be one of those unexpected wins. The recipe added this little tangy kick to the sweetness, and it wasn’t overpowering at all. Plus, making bars instead of individual cookies totally saved me time. (Anyone else hate rolling out cookie dough for a crowd?)



My family loved them. My kids demolished half the pan before I’d even finished my coffee, and my husband, who’s usually pretty meh about desserts, went back for seconds. It’s like the sourdough magic brought just enough depth to make it feel fancy but still like comfort food. I’ve already had a request to make another batch for next weekend.



One thing I learned: don’t overthink the starter. Mine wasn’t super active after sitting awhile, but it worked just fine. Also, lining the pan with parchment paper? Total game changer for getting them out cleanly. Anyone else have a go-to tip for baking with sourdough? Or accidentally discover a recipe keeper like these sourdough sugar cookie bars? I need more ideas!",1,1754248631.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False
1mgrtrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mgrtrk/met_my_ex_for_coffee_never_again/,Met my ex for coffee. Never again.,"I recently decided to meet my ex over a cup of coffee because he kept insisting on it and I kept telling him no, but eventually I thought what harm could a cup of coffee could do? I messaged him asking if he would be free this weekend and he said yes, I even made it clear to him that this is not a date it’s just a simple catch up to which he replied “I know”. We meet at a busy cafeteria. We ordered our coffees and some snacks and caught up and spoke a little on the things that were happening in our lives. Everything was perfectly chilled and normal till the bill came. A little bit of background story of when we dated my ex always got the bill, which honestly was a nice guy gesture but most of the times it made me feel a little uncomfortable when it was for every date but he always insisted on getting it as his girlfriend I felt it was okay and not a big deal. This time when we met I really wanted to get the bill for once as a small  good gesture or even a closure, but when the bill came he snatched the bill away. I literally insisted saying to let me get it at one point even pleaded that I really wanted to get it this time but he didn’t let me. I even told him that if he didn’t let it would be the last time of us meeting but he refused to budge. I didn’t want to create a scene in the cafe and sat back down. Later he saw my face and said okay let’s go to the ATM and you pay me back, it all felt so overwhelming. I felt like he could have just let me do one good thing and feel okay about myself specially when I was pleading. I felt so much anger and decided on never meeting him again it was all just too much for a simple cup of coffee. It came across that he wanted to overpower my feelings and just make himself feel like the “nice guy” as always. 

P.S. I did finally pay him back and wrote a message saying—thank you for “allowing” me to pay. 

I’ve decided to never meet him again and consider this our last and final interaction. I’m still so perturbed with the whole situation and wondering why I agreed in the first place. Did I do the right thing? ",1,1754248628.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

With all the “20 is Plenty” signs around, I’m surprised that the low-cost striping of crosswalks is so uncommon here. I’d have to think marked crosswalks are effective enough at reminding drivers of pedestrians that they are worth painting. In San Francisco, crosswalks are marked at nearly every intersection. Granted, San Francisco is a denser city, but I’m still surprised. Is the issue that paint is harder to maintain here because of snow plowing?",31,1754248611.0,TwinCities,23,0.7,False

1mgrrxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionaldyspepsia/comments/1mgrrxk/eps_now_postprandial_anyone_else/,"EPS now postprandial, anyone else?","Hi everyone,

I have had the epigastric pain syndrome for about two years, mostly food independent. I have been managing it with Nexium and low dose amitriptyline, and at times I have had months of complete remission.

Recently I got a bit overconfident with coffee and alcohol (stupid af), and after one large meal my symptoms came back. This time the pain suddenly became much more meal related. It now appears shortly after eating, but without clear food triggers. I have no nausea, no bloating, no early satiety, just the pain.

I feel like my amitryptilin choice might be worth rethinking, since Nexium has by far given me the most improvement, while amitriptyline only reduced symptoms by maybe 10 percent.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Did anything help, for example herbal remedies, prokinetics, or other approaches? I would really appreciate any tips or shared experiences.

1mgrrt2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgrrt2,Turbo Moka,"Hello friends, I am Matteo the inventor of Turbo Moka from Milano, Italy.

Many months ago, I, like many Italians, was very disappointed to know that Bialetti was sold to an investment company and decided to re invent the Italian Moka. 

To do this I did not want to just redesign the perfect version of Alfonso Bialetti, but actually I wanted to evolve it for the modern times. The original Moka Express designed almost 100 years ago was perfect but never considered energy efficiency. 

This is what I have done with Turbo Moka, optimised the design of the water chamber for maximum transfer of heat via convection and radiation of the gas flame. The first concept was to incorporate fin technology and increase the surface in contact with the hot gas whilst maintaining the same area in contact with the water. The second concept was to shape the fins so that the hot air would spiral around the water chamber and stay more time in contact with the surface area of the water chamber. After many tries we patented this concept and started making the Turbo Moka in Milan.

The result is the same moka coffee but it uses 30% less energy and time. This is a video https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHdHgiUvgHF/?igsh=bnlmanNuZmpvaTJ0 
The turbo moka water chamber can be used with the original top moka of Bialetti. At the moment we only have the 3 cup size.

1mgrqks,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1mgrqks/new_york_times_best_selling_author/,New York Times Best Selling Author.,"The worst thing you can do is befriend another writer. 

Sure, it's great. Then you realize he's better than you. Imposter syndrome, he calls it, laughing on a discord call. 

It's not *imposter syndrome* if he's the fucking imposter.  

He’s not even good.

His prose is juvenile, his characters  one-dimensional bad boys.  

Trope-ridden slop packaged for the TikTok crowd, with titles like A SOMETHING of SOMETHING AND SOMETHING. 

But he's viral and you're secretly planning his downfall. 

First, you plant negative Goodreads reviews. 

But his book is huge. 

So, you invite him for coffee. 

He turned up, smiling, glittering eyes, already with a signed copy clutched to his chest. 

I accepted it with a begrudging smile. 

Nate Aster, New York Times Best Selling Author, was standing in my kitchen sipping wine. “Soooo, I’m writing the sequel right now,” Nate said.

All I heard was: *me, me, me… did I mention me?”*

“*Anyway*,” I spoke over Nate’s overly detailed description of his love triangle. “What do you think of my first draft?”

Nate blinked. “It's… good!” He tilted his head. “I mean, it's a… start?”

He didn't read it.

That night ended prematurely. 

I woke the next morning to find a grinning Nate inches from my face. 

“Morning!” 

I jumped up. “How…?”

He shrugged with a grin, casually perched on the edge of my bed. Nate followed me into the bathroom. First in the mirror, his smile widening. 

“I dunno, man. You let me crash here!” he laughed. “Oh, guess what? They’re considering me for a six-figure book deal! How cool is that? I’ve actually made it!”

I caught a splash of scarlet staining the countertop in the kitchen. 

The prickly stink of bleach tickled my nose and throat. Looking at my fingernails, they were still stained. 

The night before, Nate called my main character *bland*, and I whacked him over the head with his book. 

But then a knife was in my hands, and I realized how *good* he was. How much better he was than me, and how much I despised his stupid fucking book. 

How much his success stung— filling my mouth with bile. So, I split the asshole apart like a Thanksgiving Turkey. 

*That was  a good line. I was saving that*. 

“Helloooooo?” Nate flicked me on the nose, snapping me to the present. “Did I tell you a famous author wants to collaborate?”

I blinked. I was covered in blood.

This guy was sitting in front of me, slurping coffee like he wasn’t a limbless hunk of flesh wrapped in my shower curtain.

Unfortunately, insufferable rival writers don't die. 

They hang in the air like spoiled milk.

Nate Aster, best selling hallucination, was a one-hit wonder. 

He reached for a croissant, stuffing it into his mouth with a wink.

“Sure!” I matched the dead boy’s grin, and his eyes narrowed, lips curving like he *knew*, and was there to be an eternal pain in the ass.

We just… drifted. And then she said, “I don’t think we’re working anymore,” and I couldn’t even argue with her. Because deep down, I knew she was right.

And yet — it still hurts like hell.

We were together for a little over a year. It wasn’t perfect, but there was love. The kind that showed up quietly — in coffee made before work, in forehead kisses, in knowing which side of the bed I liked even when we traveled. We had routines. A rhythm. I thought that counted for something.

I’ve had messy breakups before. I’ve screamed, cried, broken stuff. But this one? It ended with a soft goodbye and a hug at the door. And now I’m left with nothing to fight against. No anger. No villain. Just this stupid, slow ache that’s somehow worse than rage.

I keep catching myself doing things I used to do for her. Like saving funny TikToks or reaching for her favorite snack at the store. Then I remember she’s not here anymore. That I’m not her person. And that she’s probably adjusting fine, because she’s always been better at letting go.

I wish I hated her. I wish I could blame her for something. But she was kind. Honest. And I think that’s what’s screwing me up — realizing that sometimes love doesn’t die in a fire. Sometimes it just quietly runs out of fuel and no one notices until you’re stranded.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Sad. Confused. Lonely, even when I’m around people.

**Seminyak (3 days):**

We stayed at the Alila Hotel and honestly couldn’t have picked a better spot. It felt like the perfect place to unwind. It was ideal for relaxing, wandering, eating, and drinking. There are plenty of beautiful clubs that looked amazing, but we never quite made it to one—chilling by the pool won out every time. Even in January, the main road was lively and packed with shops, cafes, and local color—you could spend days just exploring it.

Noteworthy Spots:

* [Biku](http://bikubali.com) \- ate here only once but wish we ate here more - VERY yummy
* [Mrs. Sippy Bar](https://www.mrssippybali.com/) \- very instagram worthy but honestly, felt over-hyped; didn’t love it. 
* [Bread Yard](http://bread-yard.com/) \- great coffee!
* [Neon Palms](https://www.neonpalms.com/menu) \- very yummy! Great smoothies/acai
* [Revolver](https://revolverbali.com/pages/menu) \- AMAZING coffee and breakfast. Loved it so much I wish I had gotten merch

**Ubud (5 days):**

We stayed at the Alayla Hotel an felt like it was the perfect location. Unfortunately, I got Bali Belly our very first day in Ubud (do not underestimate how brutal this is), so we didn’t get to do as much as planned. That said, we *did* manage to see a good amount:

* Monkey Forest - beautiful to just wander
* [Yoga Barn](https://theyogabarn.com) \- if you're into yoga, spend as much time here as possible
* [L’Osteria Pizza](https://www.instagram.com/losteriapizzaecucina/) \- yummy pizza!
* [Pison](https://desty.page/pisonbali) \- v good 
* [This Jeep Tour](https://www.pelago.com/en-US/activity/pu1pi-mount-batur-sunrise-jeep-tour-bali/) it’s a very early morning but honestly it was so amazing
* We did a cooking class our second to last day in Ubud and coming off of Bali Belly, it was not great. The wet meat markets almost made a vegan out of me.

**Gili T (3 days):**

We stayed at The Pearl, and honestly, we loved it. The island definitely has a party vibe during the busier months, but even in January it still felt relaxed and enjoyable. It’s small enough to bike around easily, which made exploring super fun and laid-back. I genuinely fell in love with this place—*everything* we ate was incredible. We booked a [Catamaran Snorkeling Tour ](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g664666-d25127674-4_Experiences_in_1_Half_day_Snorkel_Lunch_Catamaran_Tour-Gili_Trawangan_Gili_Islan.html)and it was worth every cent.

We stayed in one of the many [cottage-style accommodations](https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/west-palm-cottage.html?label=gog235jc-10CAsoaEIRd2VzdC1wYWxtLWNvdHRhZ2VIM1gDaIkCiAEBmAEzuAEHyAEN2AED6AEB-AEBiAIBqAIBuALjmZTEBsACAdICJDVhNGYxZmIxLTNjN2UtNDU4ZC1iYjU2LWVmYTFlNDc1YzRjM9gCAeACAQ&sid=1308dae662e1356a0217f35ef7e82f14&aid=356980&ucfs=1&arphpl=1&dest_id=900052009&dest_type=city&group_adults=2&req_adults=2&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&req_children=0&hpos=1&hapos=1&sr_order=popularity&srpvid=91357932984c080d&srepoch=1753550063&from=searchresults) on the island—pretty typical for how small and low-key the area is. The best part of being here was renting a moped and just cruising around, exploring at our own pace. Between the scenic hikes and stunning beaches, it was the perfect mix of adventure and chill.

Noteworthy Spots:

* [Nome Beach Club](https://nomebeachclub.com/#menu) \- so beautiful and amazing breakfast
* [Penida Colada](https://penidacolada.com/?utm_source=google-my-business&utm_medium=organic) \- we didn’t get to go here but it was on our list
* [Amok Sunset Bar](https://amoksunset.com/) \- the road to get here is very odd and feels like you’re going to the middle of nowhere but my goodness this place was STUNNING and the food was absolutely amazing. 
* Kelingking Beach - hardest, greatest hike of our lives. If you don’t go all the way down, you still have to see this place in real life. 

**Nusa Dua (4 days):**

We splurged and stayed at the Ritz to end our trip. as you can imagine, it was incredible. Our priority was just to relax at the tail-end so we really didn't 'do' much here. We did go into Uluwatu for dinner one night ([Uluwatu Cliffhouse](https://ulucliffhouse.com/dine-at-ulu/) \- 10/10) but spent most of the time swimming and lounging.

I didn't find this out until after I knocked on some random person's house (a rich mansion of a person who lives up a hill) and I must have scared the s*** out of them and their dogs because the person started yelling at me through there ring camera. 

I was holding up my red pizza bag horizontally against my hip, and I was wearing my Amazon prime delivery vest because it was late at night. But they still yelled at me to put their package down.

""Pizza Delivery for (customer name)? Papa John's through Uber eats??""

""Put the packages down""

""Me:??? Did you order a Papa John's order to this address?""

""Them: no...""

Then I told them I probably had the wrong address and processed to cancel the order.

I ended up having to share one of the large pizzas with the Denny's guy from the next order I had to pick up at 3 am.

He was shot that we're open so late and so was I. At least I got to keep a large pizza and so did the Denny's person. He gave me a free coffee and I waited there until my next order.

At least I'm glad I didn't get shot by the poor home owners who I scared the shit out of at 3 am.

I'm pretty sure they thought I was attempting to burglarize them or something :(

The forests felt alive. Not in a spooky way in a storybook way. The moss was soft as carpet, the lakes so still they looked fake, and the sky had this pale blue clarity that made you feel like the world was endless.
I used to stay with my morfar (grandfather) in a little red cabin deep in the woods of Värmland. He’d wake me up early to pick lingonberries and tell me stories about trolls and skogsrå, about old gods buried under rocks and lakes that could pull you under if you looked at them too long.

I loved every second of it.
 Every smell of pine. Every wooden rune hanging in his home. Every weird folk song he'd hum when the power went out.
But that was when I was eight.
 Back when magic felt safe.
I moved back to Sweden this year. At 29. My morfar passed away and left me the cabin.
 At first, I thought it would be peaceful. A chance to escape the noise of the city in USA.
But now… I don’t sleep.
 I don’t go outside when it gets dark.
 And I don’t look at the forest anymore.
 Because something in it is watching me back.

It started on the second night.
I arrived late, just past 10 p.m., driving up the old gravel road with fog crawling across the trees like fingers.
 I unpacked, lit the fireplace, and tried to sleep.
At exactly 2:16 a.m., I heard something.
A knock.
Not on the door on the window.
 Three taps.
 Even. Soft. Deliberate.
I sat up in bed, heart thudding.
 Morfar’s cabin only has two windows. One in the kitchen. One in the bedroom.
 The bedroom one is on the second floor.
I froze.
 Didn’t move.
 Didn’t breathe.
No more knocks. No sounds of footsteps or branches cracking. Just the wind.
 I eventually convinced myself it was a bird.
 A branch.
 Sleep deprivation.
I was wrong.

Next day, I walked into town. Östra Ämtervik. Population: probably fewer than 300.
 I grabbed some groceries, made small talk. Everyone was kind… in that distant, silent Swedish way.
But when I mentioned the cabin — said I inherited it from “old Rune Dahlström” the cashier's smile vanished.
“You’re staying out there?” he asked.
 I nodded.
 He just handed me my change and said,
 “Don’t go outside after sunset.”

That night, I stayed up. Coffee in hand. Lights on. Phone charged.
Nothing happened.
Until 2:16 a.m.
 Exactly.
Three knocks.
 This time, on the kitchen window.
 Then, laughter.
Not a person’s laugh. Not exactly.
 It was too slow. Too spaced out. Like someone who’d never heard a laugh before was trying to copy one.
I stepped to the kitchen, heart jackhammering.
 There were no lights outside.
But when I got close to the window, I swear to god I saw antlers.
 Big, pale antlers rising just above the sill.
I backed away. Didn’t sleep. Didn’t move.
 When the sun finally rose, the ground outside the kitchen was littered with dead birds. All their heads turned to face the window.

I should’ve left.
 I wanted to.
But something made me stay.
I started finding carved symbols in the trees around the cabin. Circles with three lines through them.
 A friend I emailed said they were ancient Nordic protection runes. “Alghiz,” he called it. Meant for warding off evil.
But they weren’t new.
 They’d been there for years.
 My morfar had carved them.
 Surrounding the property like a barrier.
But some had been scraped out. Like someone or something had clawed through them.

Three nights ago, I woke up in the woods.
No memory of walking there.
 No shoes.
 Just me, standing among the birches, in complete silence.
I wasn’t alone.
Something stood across from me tall, thin, the antlers scraping against the trees above.
 Its eyes… no, not eyes. Holes. Blacker than the forest around them.
 Its skin looked like bark, but it moved like it had joints. Too many joints.
It whispered my name.
Not in Swedish.
 In my own voice.
I ran.
I don’t remember getting back to the cabin.
 But I locked every door.
 Turned on every light.
And the next morning, carved my own rune into the front door. Deep and shaking.

This morning, I got a letter. No stamp. No return address. Just sitting on the porch.
 Inside was a note. It was in Swedish. But translates too:
""Papa, your grandson doesn`t like me""

I used to think Sweden was magic.
 Now I know it is.
 But not in the way I thought.
There are old things here.
 Things that live in the silence, in the fog, in the still lakes and crooked trees.
 Things that remember names.
 Things that wear the voices of loved ones.
 Things that knock at 2:16 a.m.
And they do not like when you leave.
 Or when you return.

I’m leaving tomorrow.
Or at least I’ll try.
 If your reading this…
Dont go to Sweden. And if you have too, Be careful. Especially at 2:16 a.m.

Can it be brought back to its glory days? Or is it hopeless…my thoughts on love island,"• The past few seasons has definitely has definitely had moments of drama and unpredictable and I do find the the lastest season entertaining, definitely more entertaining than season 11. 

• there seems to be a growing trend in which there are no strong compatible couples in final weeks and I find myself every season simply routing for individual islanders to win like Mimii , Shakira, Cach ect I very rarely care about who they coupled up with. 



• I thought it was hillarious that in the recent episode PRODUCERS closed everyone off instead of the islanders themselves 


• Compatibility votes are utterly useless imo and it should purely just be  individual popularity votes for girls and boys and twist of how the weakest get voted off 



• I know viewership has gone down massively which I’m wondering has affected the love island budgets because there are barely any challenges anymore and as juicy and dramatic the repetitive truths and dares are I really wish producers would put on a creative hat. 


• Social Media followers have gone have reached submarine levels…..nobody’s are buying followers…it truly is a new era. 


• On the other hand we know  love island’s popularity itself isn’t an issue and the US version have incredible viewership numbers but also a devoted fan following and US islanders followers on instagram can attest to this but even they are struggling with strong couples that will last. 


• Another point I think is interesting is that there’s higher chances of couples faking it in the US version due to the attention they get as couples vs Individually and to keep up this momentum of attention one person in said couple is more likely to fake it 

• Which brings me back to Love Island UK in its glory days it was very much like how the Love Island US is now where islanders (uk) would stick together for longer due to said attention too , back when they had millions of followers to please and show off to as COUPLE posts likes >>>>>> Individual posts likes were starkly different 


• I would very much like for Love Island Uk aka THE MOTHER of love island to get back on its feet but will producers wake up and smell the coffee? Their show is failing , they are not living up to the promises they make , they are taking ZERO notes from fans nor their predecessors (love island US) , Will far more interesting questions be asked on AfterSun? Will reunions ever be brought back or is the series so utterly lackluster that they see no point in it….


• Love Island Uk started to spike in popularity because of the creativity they would continue to sprinkle in and it worked…For  a time

# Best iPhone 14 Waterproof Case 2025: Protect your Phone!

teh iPhone 14 is a significant investment, and protecting it from water damage is crucial for its longevity and functionality. Waterproof cases provide a safeguard against accidental spills, submersion, and other environmental hazards.

## Key Features Analysis

The best iPhone 14 waterproof cases offer a combination of protection,functionality,and convenience.They are designed to withstand various environmental conditions while maintaining the usability of the phone.

**IP68 Waterproof Rating:**
A crucial feature of any reliable waterproof case is its IP (Ingress Protection) rating.

Maintaining audio quality while ensuring waterproof protection is a significant challenge. Advanced case designs incorporate specialized acoustic membranes and sound channeling technologies that allow clear audio transmission during calls, music playback, and video recording. These features ensure that the case doesn't compromise the audio experience.

keeping your iPhone 14 in pristine condition with a waterproof case can significantly increase its resale value. Buyers are willing to pay more for devices that are well-maintained and show no signs of water damage or wear and tear.

## FAQs Section

Common questions regarding iPhone 14 waterproof cases often revolve around compatibility, functionality, and durability.

**Will a waterproof case affect the iPhone 14's touch screen sensitivity?**
High-quality waterproof cases are designed to maintain touch screen sensitivity. The built-in screen protector should be thin and responsive, allowing for seamless interaction with the iPhone 14's display. Though, lower-quality cases may reduce sensitivity, so its crucial to choose a reputable brand.

**Can I still use the iPhone 14's camera while it's in a waterproof case?**

1mgreli,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mgreli/does_the_keurig_ksupreme_coffee_maker_live_up_to/,Does the Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Maker Live Up to the Hype?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Supreme has been quite the caffeinated adventure for me. As someone who can't function without that first sip of coffee in the morning, I had high hopes for this machine, dubbed to be an innovative single-serve coffee maker. With its promise of MultiStream Technology and customizable brew settings, this model aimed to make my coffee experience a little more exciting. While it met many of my expectations, there are some nuances worth exploring for those considering this addition to their kitchen counter.

**Design and Build Quality**

The Keurig K-Supreme certainly looks the part of a modern coffee maker. Its silver metallic finish and compact size fit seamlessly in my kitchen, which already teeters on the edge of countertop chaos. Measuring about 10.6 inches deep by 16.2 inches wide, it doesn’t hog space—a big win for anyone working with smaller kitchens. The control buttons on the top are well-labeled and satisfying to press, but I noticed they occasionally require a firmer touch. While the design itself is sleek and appealing, it’s worth noting that the plastic components don’t feel as sturdy as I’d like for the price range.

**Performance and Brewing Options**

This little machine packs a punch when it comes to brewing capabilities. MultiStream Technology truly lives up to its hype. Unlike older models that use a single water stream for brewing, this one saturates the K-Cup pod evenly, producing a noticeable improvement in flavor. I tried several different coffee pods, and the results were consistently full-bodied and aromatic. Whether you enjoy a mild morning brew or a bold, dark roast, the adjustable strength and temperature settings ensure you can customize your cup. I found the customization options surprisingly helpful when brewing iced coffee, another neat feature of this brewer.

[Time to see Keurig K-Supreme cost on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b08nq3495f/)

**Upsides**

- The MultiStream Technology noticeably upgrades coffee flavor, especially for strong brews.  
- Compact size and sleek design fit well in most kitchen spaces.  
- Customizable settings for brew strength and temperature add versatility.  
- Ability to brew over ice without diluting flavors, making it a versatile choice for various drinks.  

**Limitations**

- The machine’s plastic parts could be more durable, given its price.  
- Buttons sometimes require multiple presses, which can be frustrating during half-asleep mornings.  

**Ease of Use and Setup**

The fully automatic operation mode makes this a wonderfully intuitive machine to use. Setting it up straight out of the box took less than 10 minutes, thanks to the clear instructions. Filling the 78-ounce water reservoir was simple, and it's removable for easy cleaning—a feature I came to really appreciate after clumsily spilling water in my old coffee maker too many times. My K-Cup compatibility is another stroke of brilliance for anyone trying to cut down on disposable K-Cups. On the downside, the machine makes a moderate amount of noise during brewing, which may not bother most, but it might be jarring if you’re someone who treasures absolute quiet in the mornings.  

**Alternatives**

Compared to other coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo or Breville Bambino, the Keurig K-Supreme holds its ground with ease of use and customization options. However, the Vertuo edges ahead when it comes to producing creamy espresso beverages. If you want a coffee-specific experience without venturing into espresso, then this coffee brewer offers more flexible use. Breville machines, though, win in terms of material quality and long-term durability. Where Keurig shines is in its unique MultiStream system, which is absent in most competitors in the single-serve category.  

**Cost Efficiency**

Priced toward the middle of the coffee maker spectrum, it presents a reasonable value when balancing its features and consistent brewing performance. While its plastic materials feel a bit cheaper than some competing brands like Breville, the high-end brewing options justify the cost. Ultimately, it’s a handy, versatile machine that offers above-average coffee without breaking the bank, but it may not win durability contests.

1mgrd3d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgrd3d,Cabinet Color Help For Dreary North Facing Kitchen?,"Hi everyone. I inherited a deceased relatives house and a very dark and dreary north facing kitchen with outdated electric. 

I don't have funds to do a gut renovation at the moment besides updated the electric to bare necessities, so extra lighting will have to be warm toned under the cabinet lighting, higher watt warm toned light bulbs, floor lamps, etc. until funds are available for the gut reno in a few years. 

Plans are to lighten the room with light, warm toned flooring and Behr Swiss Coffee paint on the walls and ceiling. I am still struggling to fund a good color to paint the cabinets. I've heard warm greens would be good, but it seems to add to the dreariness. I was wondering if I could do a lighter green or even a warmer toned purple to bring some life into the room. Im worried I might ice out the room with the purple or go too close to the toilet water post use-esque yellow that the interior of the cabinets are currently sporting. Would any of the colors I selected work? Does anyone have any other suggestions? 

Edit: All the sample kitchen rooms have Swiss Coffee on the walls.",1,1754247538.0,kitchenremodel,5,1.0,False

The reverberation of the force hit my body like a tidal wave, leaving a pit in my stomach. I stood for what felt like hours staring at the frosted glass pane on the door waiting for her silhouette to reappear. Her dark black hair highlighted with strands of purple; Her beautiful face left featureless by the glass; her image obscured like a half-forgotten memory. And that’s what she would eventually become. Another face in the crowd, another person added to the Halls of Memory; a half-remembered shade of someone who once was. The albatross around my neck. I finally snapped out of it. Good riddance, I told myself. I knew in the darkest corner of my mind that I shouldn’t have said what I said and that I shouldn’t have made the choice that I made, but to hell with it. What’s done is done. There’s no turning back time. I could survive on my own. I don’t need anyone. I can live with the emptiness that had suddenly encased every room, like spiders nesting in long neglected corners. That thick, viscous silence. Dulce et Decorum est.

 

Weeks had passed. All days becoming one. No change. Everyday had become a hazy repetition. Intoxicating rituals. Wake up, wash, get dressed, work, come home, sleep. Wake up, wash, get dressed, work, come home. I couldn’t tell you what day it was. Days had lost all meaning; time had become a nebulous concept. I stared at that frosted glass pane every day; a vacuous habit, a vain hope that maybe, just maybe, she’d come back. After a while, like always, I gave up and turned towards my apartment. The kitchen had become a tip, empty boxes of ready meals covered all surfaces, with the last remaining gaps of marble gasping for air. The living room was musty, with a thick layer of dust covering everything; the leather settee we bought together in that charity shop one summer was greyer than brown. However, I noticed something. On the left side of the settee, where she sat for hours and hours watching television as Her head rested on my shoulder, the dust was slightly thinner. An outline rested exactly where she once sat. I stared at the seat for the longest time until I gave up the ghost. Good riddance, I told myself. Good riddance.

 

I eventually stumbled into my bedroom. An unkempt place, occupied by an air of self-pity and disillusionment. The bedsheet unmade, crumpled in a corner. The bottom sheet soaked by the cold sweat of countless sleepless nights. Dreams had become my worst enemy. I spent countless nights imagining a better life, one where I was happy; where I had the perfect job, the perfect house, the perfect car and I had Her. Good riddance, I told myself. Good riddance. My desk had become a shrine of my hollowness, littered by unwashed plates, empty cigarette boxes and half-drunk cans. Putrid, bubbling green fungi invaded the stack of forgotten crockery, slowly colonising every inch and every scrap of uneaten food. I sat down on my bed and wallowed in the constant feeling of guilt that festered in my stomach and coursed through my veins; a feeling that I knew better than myself. It had always been there, the pit in my stomach, the small pinprick of pain in my chest, but after what I said to Her… it was almost like I’d given it more leeway; more power; like an old wound being infected by bacteria, spreading systematically through the flesh and veins until there’s nothing left. I took off my uniform and threw it into its usual corner; a concert poster hanging over it like a guardian angel. I met Her at that concer- stop. Good riddance, I told myself. Good riddance.

 

 If I should die before I wake… I’d be so lucky. For that to happen, I would need to sleep first. Even the sweet release of that temporary death was taken from me, sleep always being kept at an arm’s length. Hours dedicated to conjuring never-when’s and could’ve-beens; the grand what-ifs in the long-game of life. Timelines of points where I made the wrong choice or missed an opportunity mapped perfectly on a proverbial pin board, carmine twine paging strands between the points, like the web of time and its overflowing branches. After what felt like 10,000 years, the Lord of Dreams finally allowed me to enter their kingdom and the sweet chemical bliss of REM washed over me. Darkness crawled over me as my vision slowly began to fade, the emptiness of my personal mausoleum was replaced by the soft euphoria of blissful ignorance. Movement around me threatened to rip me out of my bliss. My bedsheet seemed to rise and fall around me, almost as if someone had climbed into bed. I flipped over and flailed an arm over to try to feel for anything. Nothing. If there was someone there, my hand passed through them. My hand reached the mattress. As cold as the long-forgotten snowman on boxing day, his body melting as the porcelain snow decayed into sludge. The putrefaction of winter. I dreamt of warmth. That familiar warmth. The warmth that once comforted me into gentle nights. Closeness. The relaxing darkness that was my dream slowly changed; light faded into view, like an old theatre pulling back the curtains. Her face filled the screen. I lay paralysed in my seat. The screening was empty, just abandoned rows of empty seats, the red-felt backing had torn and decayed, exposing the yellowing cotton foundations. I stared as my hippocampus projected every moment that I shared with Her. The first date, the first kiss, the first time, the first meal, the first film, the first-time doing chores together, the first-time shopping together, the first time we shared a bed together; the same bed where my shell now resides. The picture show stopped; the reel frozen between frames; Her image jittering and shaking. I stared into Her eyes, but she seemed to look past me. The film started again, replaying everything but slightly faster. And then again. And again. And again. And again, until the collage of memories was a blur, our life together played as my punishment. The tape suddenly stopped and played again, this time at a normal pace. It was Her birthday and I’m watching Her open Her gifts. She couldn’t stop smiling but feigned annoyance at how much I had spent on Her. I watched until she got to the last gift, the smallest of the lot. Wrapping paper shot around the room like particles being energised during fusion. It was a DVD, some schlock movie that had become an inside joke. She opened the case and tears began to fill Her eyes. A smile. Her smile. The most beautiful sight I’ve ever seen. The reel stops. Her smile burned onto my retinas, a permanent shade to haunt me when I close my eyes. The hippocampus withdraws into the recesses as its mission has been completed and the cinema evaporates behind it.

Alone now. I stand in nothingness. Darkness. Vastness. Movement. Something was moving through the darkness, and it was heading straight for me. The hairs on the back of my neck rose like the army of the undead. Closer. A wave of coldness washed over me, like the coldest darkest winter possible. Closer. The pit in my stomach cascades, that old familiar sting; threatening to destroy my very being from inside out. Closer. A hand grasped my shoulder. My brain explodes as memories flood my synapses. Neural pathways clogged with pain and loss and happiness and laughter and joy and misery and weeping and warmth and cold and fear and adoration and hatred and apathy. I miss; I want; I crave; I- The figure of darkness, The Yearn, grabs my neck and pulls my head back. With breath as cold as Christmas Eve, it rasps in my ear.

**“YOU YEARN.**”

I woke with a start. My bedsheets soaked with cold sweat. I lunged forwards, ripping the air from my lungs. I sat panting like a dog trying to catch my breath again. My eyes tried to adjust to the pale blue light, but everything remained an abstraction. The only spot illuminated by the night was the emptiness of Her pillow; God’s latest joke on me, providing me a visual gag for my own private distress. I stayed sat staring at the empty space for an unending length of time. By the time I looked up again, the dawn chorus had performed its hymn, allowing the harsh hue of daylight to filter through. Even the wall of dust and mould was not strong enough to stop the light. I shielded my eyes and rose from my proverbial coffin. The room stunk of body odour and musk. Specks of dust danced through the air, illuminated by the golden glow of dawn. I slowly crawled to my bathroom and stared into my reflection. My raven hair had become a flat jumble of strands pointed in various directions. Pale-blue irises flooded by pools of crimson, left vacant of light. Unkempt whiskers and patches of wild bush attached to my face. I put my head down to the yellowed porcelain sink and splashed my face with lukewarm water. As I rose, I looked back into the mirror; I imagined that this is what Dorian Gray saw when he glanced upon his portrait. A decaying cadaver comprised of one’s own sins, staring back. In the corner of the glass frame stood a black shade, an obscured feminine figure. A sense of familiarity to it. It felt so familiar, like I’ve known it for my entire life but not at the same time. The Yearn.  I spun around as fast as I could. Too fast as I lost all balance and slammed face first onto the grimy panelled floor. A crack of bone was followed by the slow crawl of crimson blood. I turned around and looked up. No figure. The feeling subsided, replaced by waves of pain from my face. At least a broken nose got me out of my shift that day, especially as Mrs. Wheeler on the deli counter had an irrational fear of blood.

 

\*\*\*

 

A few months had passed. Other than a subtle pain in my nose and occasional dry-heaving spells, things had gotten better. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it was a step forward. The flat was still a wasteland of unsanitary surfaces, but it felt more like home. I could feel comfortable again without feeling a hot breath crawl across my back. Day-to-day life slowly morphed into a loose construct; some form of mobius strip floating in a vacant void. The tick and tocks of seconds, minutes, hours, days became dull to my senses. Routine was the only thing stopping the madness from invading. The flat reflected that, piles upon piles upon piles of rubbish and crockery and cigarette buds and empty pint glasses. A dense yet shallow mist had seemed to have filled the space; perhaps on account that the windows hadn’t been opened ever since… well, ever since.

They never stopped; you know. The few friends I hadn’t alienated with my absence. Sending me updates, screenshots, reposts; you name it. Seemingly archiving HER life without me in my phone. On my phone. SHE seemed happy. Without me. Posting Herself. Posting Her mates. Posting Her new house. Posting Her new car. Posting Her new job. Posting Her new boyfriend.

I could see myself in those posts. There would always be a gap in the image. A space between people in a group photo. A tree in a photo of a beautiful sunlit landscape. I was a grain in the image compression, a ghost of digital noise. A half-formed entity, trapped between pixels on a screen. The obvious response anyone would have to my sheer neuralgia would be “don’t look at the images”, “Ignore Her posts”, “Move on.” Believe me, I tried. I have tried, am trying and will continue to do so. I had become trapped within my own feedback loop. I can delay looking, distract myself with alcohol, the TV and jaunts to the local shop for another pack of reds but no matter how hard I tried to keep this incessant compulsion in the foreground of my mind, my focus would stop, and all the mental boundaries crumbled, Her smiling face. Brightened by manufactured screens.

 

I lost two hours. Time loss. I stared for so long that the goddamn phone battery died, and daylight had become shrouded by the dark. I pulled myself forwards and towards my bed. It’s crazy when you think of how one small thing can shatter your psyche. Psychic damage, if you will; getting kicked down even when we were so far apart. After what felt like a century-and-a-bit, I reached the musty, bordering-on-damp sponge I called my bed. I couldn’t even remember the last time I changed the sheets. Who cares? It’s hardly as if anyone will come in here. Ever again. The sensation of simply lying down brought such tangible warmness to my soul I thought I was going to weep. I chucked my phone across the room; I at least had the foresight to know that scrolling mindlessly on my phone wouldn’t achieve anything. I lay in bed for so long. Just staring at the ceiling. I imagined those little crackles in the paint each housed a small community of bugs, congregating and reproducing. Each tiny pocket of neglect housing life. It felt nice thinking that. Thinking that the world didn’t stop because She left. Did she leave? Or did I tell her to? What did I say that broke it all? Why did it have to end at all? I had entrapped myself in exile for so long that even the memories had begun to fade. Moving picture decaying into snapshots, exaggerated caricatures and misremembered anecdotes. I spent all that night trying to remember moments we had; not the important one, I could easily remember them, but a random day. I picked a date at random. Couldn’t remember. Tried another, couldn’t remember. We lived together for years, and I couldn’t even remember what we did most of the time. Had we just become stagnant? Had the monotony of domesticity taken its toll? I just couldn’t remember. This was the person I wanted to die in the arms of. She was absolutely everything; my rock, my one and only love, the person I would do anything for… and I couldn’t remember our life. I couldn’t even remember her face.

 

I thought about dying more than I thought about living. That careless thought came to me more than an idea of a future. The prospect of an escape, a cut to black, was more tantalising than continuing. I recognised that I was a bad person; this whole ordeal I allowed myself to fester in was one of my own makings. I dealt the killing blow after all. I was the one who told Her to leave. I was the one who took the argument too far. I was my own captor and my own executioner. The faculty that bestowed my own downfall was one of my own design. The curse of free will and misjudgement. I wasn’t haunted by the actions of others, I was never wronged by people I had and will love; I was my own shadow on the wall, my own premonition breathing down my neck, my own hangman’s noose. My own insecurities and hubris was my own true enemy. I was the problem. I had to be better. I had to make a better man of the husk emptied out by me. I knew the effect I had on the people before and more than likely will have; they will love and hate me on all measures, that’s just being human; no one man is an island nor a god. I had to change that. I had to be better for both others and me. I had to make myself happy. But how?

She had her own issues too, obviously, who doesn’t? We both made each others life a living hell. By the end, I think we hated each other, but that doesn’t justify what I did, that day and any day before. I wasn’t the best boyfriend, and I doubt I ever will be. That’s just how life is. You’re great at some things and great at others; every person on this planet is in one way or the other a Jack-of-all-trades. But I still did what I did, I said what I said and didn’t say what I should have done. She deserves better and is getting it. Why can’t I find the same? Because I didn’t believe I could and probably never fully will. Guilt is the closet thing to a haunting a human will ever feel. The skeleton in the closet and I had run out of space and started burying them under the floorboards. The Hall of Memories decaying into a mausoleum.

A crash came from the living room. I flew up from bed, almost breaking my neck in the process. Not that it wouldn’t have been easy to do so by that point, I couldn’t remember the last time I properly ate a meal. I waited in bed, alert, waiting for any other signs of life. Nothing. Just that familiar stagnant silence. I crept out of bed, picked up the cracked baseball bat I kept next to me and slowly walked through the flat. It was somehow darker than usual; I knew it was night, but it never got this dark; I could barely see anything ahead of me. It was like this darkness was a liquid blackness, filling up all the space as I swam through it. With my bat raised above me, I finally crept into the living room, tripping over the mouldy carpet in the process and passing through the glass coffee table. The pain hit me immediately, pinprick of pain jolting through my back and my hands. My hands were moist with the crimson liquid, transparent shards of glass embedded into my fingertips, blood oozing over them. I lay there wincing in pain when I felt something. A slow, repeating shift in the wooden floor. The floorboards rising and falling softly. Step. Step. Step. I looked up.

The first thing that really struck me was how white those eyes were, or at least what I assume were eyes. They were too flat to be natural. Perfect porcelain circles staring blankly back at me with piercing black dots for irises. Too uncanny to be human. Not too uncanny for me to recognise the burning hatred held within. A supernova of contentment encased in porcelain prisons. I felt a ball of dampness hit my head and crawl down my face. It was warm and viscous. It took me longer than it should have to realise that it came from its mouth. Perfectly formed teeth of uncountable proportion surrounded by that same liquid darkness. Two rows of countless yellow and green teeth stood over me agape, that warm saliva oozing around them. I didn’t move. Couldn’t move. Fear trapped me and held me down. Its eyes did not blink, and it made no noise. Just watching me. Observing, waiting to see what I would do next.

 

Whatever it was, it hated me. I just knew it. I could feel this burning vitriol in my soul; the way its putrid form was looking at me. The purest form of visceral loathing powered this cadaverous husk that stood above me. I held its stare for as long as I could before a cascade of dread washed upon me. I leapt up from the floor, the crimson tide of my hacked-up arm spraying the walls in blood as I tried in vain to somehow outmanoeuvre the being in front of me. The Husk leapt towards me, missing me by mere inches. It began growling and screaming as it barrelled towards me at full force, like the wildest wolf in the densest forest. I scrambled to my bedroom and slammed the door. I slumped down with my back against it, my body being juddered forwards by the barrage of blows as The Husk rammed itself towards it. It gnarled and screeched with each painstaking push. I closed my eyes, with the infantile hope that it would simply just go away. The barrages were constant, my frail form threatening to break apart with each passing blow. Why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this fate? All I wanted was to just be left alone; alone to rot and wallow and meander within my own prison of self-imprisonment. Was that what I wanted? I wasn’t even sure of that anymore. The burning need to run was fading away from me but the absence of it was yet to be filled. I hated this. I hated it all. I hated myself for allowing myself to fall so far down the rabbit hole and create this prison. It was ironic really, this flat, this home; only husks remain – The Husk screaming at my door and my own husk, cowering in fear on the other side. Why did I hate so much? The feeling was almost intoxicating, it seemed to drive me, control me, take over every thought and gesture. I never noticed it until now, this “yearning” for better times had been replaced by a festering, bubbling anger that tore at my very being. I wasn’t even sure I loved Her anymore, or even the memory of Her, just a hatred of her and her absence in my life. This wasn’t healthy, this was sickness, and I needed to change. Something had to change.

The Husk was still barrelling at the door, each hit followed by the increasing sound of wood chipping and breaking apart. It was coming and I had no way to stop it, just to accept my inevitable fate. I crawled slowly backwards, towards the crumpled yellow mattress. With one final yell, The Husk broke down my door and entered my inner sanctum. It stood on hind legs, purring with a croaking intertwined with each breath. Those yellowing teeth formed a horrific smile, like the Gate of Insanity itself were slowly opening towards me, allowing me sanctuary from reality. As it moved slowly towards my shaking body, it began to rise to its feet, this towering cadaver was gliding towards me with a twisted grace; its mucus-covered mouth still creeping into an impossibly vast smile. It was playing with me, trying to get all the fear it could, tenderising the meat. Step. Step. Step. It loomed over me, savouring this moment; the smell of putrefaction and burnt flesh swam into my nose and threatened to churn my stomach. Its eyes still filled with that burning fire, as if my existence was an offence to it. Its face drew closer towards me but went as slowly as possible, making my radiating fear last as long as humanly possible. I didn’t want to die like this. I didn’t want to die. This thought weirdly gave me solace. For God knows how long I had been in this purgatory for, the concept of Death was warming to me, it called to me; like I was a lost traveller in the Ozarks, and it was the lone standing shelter in a sea of towering trees. But when I was faced with the certainty of it, I couldn’t commit. The calling to survive was still there. I screamed and leapt towards it, pushing it to the ground. The Husk’s form cracked and creaked as it fell, a screech that could’ve come from Hell itself followed. I used the few seconds I had to grab the cracked baseball bat from the side of my bed. The Husk had begun to regain balance, and I raised the bat and swung it towards its head. The impact was instantaneous as bubbling black fluid sprayed all my face. The Husk screamed with terrifying agony as I raised the bat again and again and again and again, releasing the rage and fear and guilt that had consumed so much of who I was onto this disgusting being. I wasn’t sure when I stopped hitting the creature or when the creature stopped moving. I found myself stood over it, breathing so heavily I thought my lungs would collapse in my chest; globs of black gunk slowly drifted down off my face and onto the broken cadaver that lay in front of me. The Husk was dead and so was the burning in my heart and in my soul. A gentle quietness seemed to wash over me.

 

I felt… new. Something had shifted in that moment. Colours I didn’t even realise had been missing came back into view, light filled up my bedroom for the first time in so, so long. A warm tear fell from my eye. I stepped over the Husk, its putrid form fading away as the ray of sunlight moved further and further into the room. Birdsong swept through the corridors, gently pushing away the clouds of dust and cigarette smoke. I stood in my living room and took it all in; the indentation on the sofa was gone, it now lay completely unoccupied. I hadn’t looked at this room in months, I had almost forgotten that the walls were that beautiful maroon. Another warm tear fell. The threat of a smile began to tug at the muscles in my face. I crept towards the door. There she was. The Yearn. That silhouette filled with nostalgia and bliss. She stood there, thin strands of hair blowing in the gentle breeze of the outside world. Her hand, held against the windowpane. I reached the door and pressed my hand against hers, savouring that feeling one last time. I moved my hand back and with one swift movement, I broke the glass. The Yearn had gone. Nothing lay behind the door other the street opposite and that large oak tree, its orange leaves and cracking branches indicating the herald of Autumn.

 

The Yearn was gone.

I opened the door.

After Garibaldi had told me what my role in the circus would be, a beast gladiator, sleep just would not come to me that night. I returned to my tent and did my best to fall asleep, but who could with the knowledge that they would be fighting some sort of wild animal to the death? I stared at the ceiling of my tent room and couldn’t help but wish that something would fall on me and crush me to death there and then. After I got bored of hoping something would fall on me, I began to toss and turn to try and see if maybe that way I could fall asleep. But it didn’t work either. It must’ve been 3 or 4 in the morning when my thirst got the better of me and forced me from my futile hopes of sleeping. 



I walked over to my door, hopeful that it was open. To my relief, it was, as I turned the knob and began to exit into the hallway, however, I bumped right into Victor. The sewn-together creature looked just as surprised as I was to see him. It figured that he would still be there watching over me as I ‘slept’. I sighed and was about to slam the door in his face again when I thought back to how Victor had saved me from Melite. If it hadn’t been for him, I would have drowned in her tank and been eaten by her. 



“Can I go and get some water?” I asked him, my voice groggy and just a bit hoarse. Victor stared at me for a moment, the dusty gears in his head turning, before he nodded and reached into his pocket. He pulled out a bottle of water and offered it to me. “Thank you,” I said as I took the bottle from him. I twisted it open, satisfied when I heard the seal breaking as I twisted the cap. I wouldn’t put it past Garibaldi to poison me with something in the water. I drank most of it in one go, and stared at Victor as he watched me drink from it. 



“What’s your story? Did Antonio just like…find you?” I asked Victor after I finished with the bottle. Victor appeared to me like how MacnCheese had looked from when I was first at the Freakshow. Was Victor a gift from the mysterious friend that Garibaldi had? Victor stared at me for a moment, the gears in his head working overtime to try and figure out an answer to my question. I worried that I might have given him too big a question to answer. 



“Col…leg. S…ad he…ad. A…ll bet…er!” He declared triumphantly after the most painful butchering of the English language I’d ever heard. I stared at him for a moment, nodding to him gently like I was speaking to a toddler who just babbled to me. 



“Right…well, I’m going to bed. Thank you for the water. And, um, for saving me.” I handed him back the empty water bottle. He took it and smacked himself in the head with it. It caught me off guard for a moment, until I realized that he was saluting me. I gave a small smile and waved goodnight to him as I closed the door to my room. Properly hydrated, I lay back in bed and was finally able to fall asleep after a few more minutes of staring up at the ceiling. 



I was awoken a few hours later by the sound of an explosion right outside my room. I was so caught off guard by the sound that I tumbled out of bed and landed on my face. I shot up, looking all around, wondering if the Freakshow was on fire or something. After I looked around to ensure that my room wasn’t about to burn down around me, I stood up from the floor and walked over to the window of my room. Peering from the barred window, I was greeted by the sight of the clown István stuffing what looked like one of the aces into what looked to be a miniature cannon. 



“In you go! In you go! We must make big boom of you!” He giggled happily, grabbing a stick from one of the other Aces who had gathered around him, and starting to shove the unknown Ace into the cannon. In my gut, I could already tell that it was most likely Hearts without even having to see him. “There we go! We see how good you fly!” István cackled excitedly as he curled up into a ball and rolled around the cannon in excitement. The other Aces seemed just as excited, while Heart’s legs wiggled from inside the cannon. 



“Brother, it is early for this noise.” A tired voice grumbled. I turned my gaze to see the second clown, the long-haired and seemingly stilt-walking clown László. He seemed just as done with his antics as I was, and I had only just woken up. His brother scoffed at him as he took a box of matches from Spades. 



“Must lighten up, brother! We practicing!” He giggled almost manically as he lit the match. Before he could light the fuze on the cannon, László bent down slightly and snuffed out the match with his fingertips. István stared at him as if he had just spat in his eye, before quickly striking another match and keeping it away from his brother. A short fight broke out between them, the Aces watching amazed while Hearts continued to wiggle from inside the cannon. Finally, after a few seconds, István succeeded in lighting the fuze. It burned quickly, and soon a small explosion shot Hearts right out of the cannon and into a nearby pile of tarps and wood. 



The Aces clapped their little sleeve covered hands, and László groaned in annoyance. I finally pulled away from the window and decided that it was better to just start the day, since it was obvious that I wasn’t going to get any sleep with all the noise happening right outside my tent. 

I opened my door and was surprised to find that Victor wasn’t guarding it. I took this as a sign that I was allowed to walk around, so I knew exactly where I would head first. To get some breakfast. 



“Benny, my sweet baby boy!” Abigail gushed as I entered her bakery with a soft knock. I waved to her as she quickly walked over to me and practically dragged me to a table. She sat me down before I could even say anything to her. “You sit right here, mister. And I’ll be right back with a muffin and some coffee for you. They’re fresh out of the oven.” She quickly walked away and went behind the counter to begin fetching my things. I smiled at her, still happy to have her here at the Freakshow. I looked around the bakery she had, and then noticed that there were a lot of the other members of the Freakshow all walking around outside and seemingly getting ready for something. 



“What’s up with them?” I asked Abigail as she brought me a tray of muffins and a cup of coffee, leaving the metal coffee pot on the table next to the muffins. She looked at the window and then back to me, taking a seat and gently grunting as she finally settled into her chair. 



“The next performance is later this afternoon, so everyone must be scrambling to get ready. I must admit, I’m thankful that I don’t have to do all that anymore.” She giggled, and I smiled at her as I sipped my coffee and ate one of the muffins she had made me. She was much older than when I had last seen her. She was like a stereotypical grandmother now, and the role suited her just perfectly. 



“Garibaldi gave me my assignment last night. I’m the beast gladiator.” I stared at the coffee in my mug. The thought of what he would have me do was weighing heavily on my head. But when I looked up at Abigail, she didn’t seem to be too worried about things. She just smiled at me and put her hand on mine. 



“You’re going to do wonderful, Benny. I just know it.” Abigail was the mother I wished I had had as a child. If I did have her as one, maybe I could’ve avoided all of this. But at the very least, having known her at all because of this place was one of the few bright spots. I finished with my breakfast and the chat I had with Abigail before deciding to go and try and see what I was meant to be doing. Unfortunately for me, I couldn’t just hide in her bakery for the whole day. 



As I walked around the grounds of the Freakshow, I bumped into a few people. Vergil was with Bronwyn, talking to each other and deep in conversation, so I thought it best not to bother them. They seemed a good fit for each other, Vergil being some sort of goat hybrid, and Bronwyn having a bat head seemingly growing out of her head. As I wandered around, I was quickly hit with the fact that I had no idea what I was even supposed to be doing. I figured that maybe I should be practicing or something, but I had no idea where to even start. And the less I interacted with Garibaldi, the better for everyone. 



“There you are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you.” A familiar French voice called to me. I turned to see Mathieu walking over to me, leaning heavily on his cane as he did so. His new gargoyle body was a little off-putting to me, but at this point, what didn’t in the Freakshow? 



“Did you want to talk to me about something?” I asked him, walking over so as not to have him walk too far. He seemed to be in pain, and the less he moved, the better for him. He nodded as he let his tail fall to the ground with a soft thud. 



“Yes, but it would be better if we talked in the Big Top.” He sighed as he reached a stone claw into his pocket. It was a bit of a walk for him to make it to the Big Top, but it seemed like he didn’t plan on walking all the way there. He pulled out a deck of cards from his pocket and bent them slightly in his stone hands. “I’m sure you’ll remember this trick.” He offered me a fanged smile as he released the cards from his hand. They fluttered around us and completely covered us. And when they all finally disappeared, we were suddenly in the Big Top. We were in the front row of the bleachers, with the stage in front of us.



“I remember that trick all right. It saved my life on the train.” I sighed as I sat down on one of the benches. Mathieu followed suit, and as he sat down, I could hear his rock body grind and crack as he sat down next to me. “You scared the shit out of me when I first met you.” I chuckled, looking at him. He looked back at me and offered a halfhearted chuckle of his own.



“Well, I was upset by my curse. But at this point, there’s hardly even a part of me that’s still human. It’s mostly all rock now. I didn’t mean to scare you so badly. And well, when I saw you after Nikolai and Santiago were killed, I had to save you. No one deserves to be on the receiving end of Antonio.” He tapped his cane on the ground gently. I nodded and thought back to the moment when I had been saved by Mathieu. It got me thinking about my time as a child in the Freakshow. And soon, I remembered several members who didn’t seem to be here anymore.



“What happened to the twins, Edgar and Allan? And what about Jasper?” I asked him, suddenly remembering the conjoined twins. I hadn’t known them very well during my first stay at the Freakshow, but I remember that Jasper had been kinder to me than Eva had been. Mathieu sighed heavily, his long brown hair was down to his shoulders, and he reached up to fiddle with it for a moment. 



“The twins died a few years after you escaped. They had a heart condition. It couldn’t keep them both alive, so we lost them because of that. Not a horrible way to go, all things considered. But…Jasper was a different story.” He looked out at the Big Top stage, and I followed his gaze. There, I saw Eva talking with Bronwyn, who had entered the tent along with Vergil. 



“What happened?” I asked, watching as Eva pointed to the ceiling of the Big Top where the trapeze act was, and seemingly coordinating something with Bronwyn. It struck me there that Bronwyn was her new partner. Which most likely meant, something had happened to Jasper. 



“It was during a performance. Eva and Jasper were doing their normal sash routine. But at the big climax, Jasper reached up to grab her hand. And she missed him. It was by only a few centimeters. But she missed him. And Jasper fell back to Earth.” Mathieu stared down at his stone feet. “Eva screamed so loudly that night that she lost her voice for four months because of it. And she’s never forgiven herself for dropping him.” I couldn’t help but feel my heart shatter into pieces imagining what had happened. While Eva and Jasper had seemingly been at each other's throats when I had first been there, it seemed that they did care for one another. And all the times Eva had threatened to drop him had been a joke between partners. 



“What about Maxwell and Chester? And…the shapeshifter.” I said the last name with pure vitriol in my soul. My old ‘parnter’ had been the reason that Nikolai and Santiago had been killed. It had been a spy for Garibaldi and had informed him of everything I had done during my time there. The last I had seen of it was when I had trapped it in a magical jar before escaping the Freakshow. 



“Ah, well. The freaks were heavily damaged the night of the fire. Instead of just throwing them away, Antonio decided to turn them into that stupid Jack-in-the-box.” Mathieu snuffed. At the mention of that, it suddenly became clear to me what had kidnapped me from my basement that night. That stupid clown had been the one to bring me here. “We call them Kraft now, since they’re a lot different than they used to be.” Mathieu looked at me, seeing that I was more interested in what happened to the shapeshifter. 



“I don’t know what happened to it. No one has seen it since that night of the fire. We all figured that it left with you. But then Starla told me about the jar she gave you, so I’m not exactly sure where it went. But,” he said before motioning in the direction of the stage. There, I noticed that Garibaldi and Victor were doing their rounds. The bug man stared at everyone, his mandibles softly closing and opening, while Victor followed him like a puppy. “I don’t trust that one. He follows Antonio everywhere, and worse still. He was a gift from the voodoo king. The one who fixes Starla up.” Mathieu shook his head. I nodded, having my suspicions confirmed about Victor’s origins.



Just as we were staring at them, the gruesome duo began to make their way over to us. Victor was dressed differently from what he normally wore. He seemed more presentable and was wearing a suit that looked as if it was intended to be worn and didn’t appear hastily thrown together, as it normally did. But most off-putting to me was that his normal button eyes had been replaced by what looked to be white glass eyes. 



“Why are you just sitting here? You should be practicing.” Garibaldi clicked at me. He was leaning heavily on his mantis-headed cane, and his breathing was labored. He had clearly exerted himself a lot today. I couldn’t help but scoff at him.



“You really need me to practice getting mauled by animals? I was assuming you were just going to watch and enjoy me struggle.” I crossed my arms as I stared at him. The ringleader narrowed his eyes at me before seeing that Mathieu was sitting next to me. 



“He was meant to practice with you.” Garibaldi pointed a claw at Mathieu, who nodded. A deep rattling noise echoed inside Garibaldi’s body. “But if you want to give me an attitude, then by all means, ruin your performance and make a dumbass of yourself!” His body cracked internally, and I watched as the scar across his face began to crack open. Victor looked up at his boss, quickly wrapping his arms around Garibaldi’s arm. The ringleader looked down at his emotional support puppet before grunting softly. Victor began to tug on his sleeve and lead him away from me and Mathieu. 



I sighed gently, thankful that my big, stupid mouth hadn’t led to my death just yet. I looked over at Mathieu, who was smiling at me, like a proud father who had just heard his kid swear for the first time. “It is true that we are meant to practice together. You won’t be fighting real animals. Most people don’t enjoy watching live animals suffer, so you will be fighting my illusions. But don’t think that they are just holograms, they could hurt you if you aren’t careful.” He started to try and stand up from the bleachers, but I put a hand on his stone claw. 



“I’m a theater major, and a professor. I can wing it just fine. I’d much rather catch up with you, Mathieu.” I gave him a gentle smile, and I could tell that he was caught off guard. He slowly sat back down, and we began chatting again. We chatted until at last, I left to go change into my clown outfit. Upon my return to the backstage area, I was mesmerized by the number of people, and of the sheer scale of everything around me. It was clear that since I had last been at the Freakshow that things had only gotten more advanced and grander. I poked my head out from behind the curtain to watch, feeling like a little kid again, filled with excitement. 



“Ladies and Gentlemen!” Garibaldi’s hoarse voice called out. He was front and center on stage, a large megaphone in his painted claws. “We thank you for your patronage today! And I hope that you will enjoy the show of my lovely, Freaks!” With this triumphant announcement, he disappeared into a puff of multicolored smoke. The crowd erupted into cheers and claps, and I felt tempted to join them, but I settled on just watching everything. 



Spotlights flashed on and quickly pointed high into the sky. I saw Bronwyn walking on a tightrope. She swayed from side to side and looked like she’d topple over at any moment. And to my shock, she did. She began to plummet to earth, the crowd gasped along with me, when suddenly she stretched her arms out, and used the bat wings tied to her arms and her costume, to begin gliding around the Big Top. The crowd erupted into cheers again, and to my amazement, as Bronwyn glided around the tent, Eva came into view, swinging in on a trapeze bar. She let it go and began to spin in mid-air, before she grabbed a second trapeze bar and also reached out to grab Bronwyn. 



The duo swung around in the air, before suddenly a bright, flaming ring appeared in the middle that the two both jumped through. The spotlights shut off, and the whole tent was only illuminated by the flaming ring. I was amazed that Gariabldi even allowed this to happen, if he was so afraid of fire. Soon, the fire quickly went out, only to be replaced with what looked to be a giant flaming dragon. I thought for a moment that it was one of Mathieu’s illusions, but then I saw that it was actually Vergil onstage. He looked just as mesmerized as everyone else as he spat gasoline onto a flaming torch to create the giant flaming dragon that was now flying around the tent. As it passed by me, I was stunned that no heat came from it. I had expected a full face of flaming air to hit me, but it didn’t. That explained how the whole tent didn’t spontaneously erupt into flames. 



As the dragon came crashing down to the ground, it suddenly disappeared. And rising from the smoke came the Aces. I audibly cheered when I saw my little friends, arranged in their usual pyramid. Just then, István came rolling in and knocked them all over. As he did so, the Aces seemingly fell into a million pieces on the floor. István unrolled himself and appeared shocked by what he had done. Then, László appeared. He leaned down and bonked his brother on the head, much to the delight of everyone, who began to laugh at the two clowns. 



The brothers gathered up the pieces of the Aces before stuffing them into the cannon that István had been practicing with in the morning. István began patting himself, searching for a match, it seemed. László comically rolled his eyes before simply giving the cannon a smack on the back. The cannon erupted into a giant explosion, which launched all the pieces of the Aces out, and much to my joy and amazement, they landed perfectly placed back together. They each looked at each other before taking their heads off and passing them between themselves, finally having the correct heads. Except for Hearts, whose head was being used as a ball by the others. 



“I’m sorry to interrupt your enjoyment. But it’s almost our turn,” Mathieu said as he appeared next to me. He startled me, and I sighed as I turned to leave the amazing show. Of course, I was a part of it, so it made sense that it was my turn soon. I got situated with Mathieu, and he handed me a small shield and a little metal sword.



“Really? This is all I get?” I asked with a raised brow. Mathieu shrugged as he began to shuffle some cards in his giant stone hands. 



“What’d you expect? A shotgun?” He scoffed, which got a small giggle from me. Soon, it was my turn to step out onto the stage. The crowd cheered for me as I stared out at them. The spotlight shone down on me. I gently closed my eyes and began to think back on some things that made my life happy. My students, the ones who actually had a passion to be there, were the whole reason that I stayed alive. I care about them so much, and I knew I had to succeed to have a chance to see them again. 



“And now, introducing our main event! The Great Beast Hunter, Benjamin!” Garibaldi’s voice shouted from some unseen location. I puffed out my chest and presented my sword to the crowd, who all cheered for me. I banged my sword against the shield to amp myself up. Meanwhile, I watched as Mathieu finished shuffling his cards and suddenly blew on them. A puff of smoke came out of them, and suddenly, I was being attacked by three wolf-like creatures. They were pitch black, with red eyes and horns. They almost reminded me of the shapeshifter, and it made fighting them all the more easier. 



They lunged at me, and I managed to bash one of them in the face with my shield, sending it flying. The crowd roared in excitement as I did my best to stay light on my feet. I’m not exactly an athletic person in my line of work, but I know enough sword choreography from Shakespeare plays to keep up. I couldn’t help but smile at the idea of my students seeing me now, actually fighting literal monsters. After a few more passes between us, I managed to stab one of the wolves with a parry thrust. It exploded into a puff of smoke, and the crowd again went wild. This seemingly scared the other two away as they suddenly ran off stage. 



I turned and waved to the crowd, who all gave me a huge round of applause and cheered for me. Just then, the spotlights turned a deep red. I looked up, confused, before I turned to look at Mathieu. He was shuffling some more cards with a look of despair on his stone face. He mouthed an apology at me and blew on a card. A much larger cloud of smoke wafted onto the stage and soon began to solidify into the shape of an enormous centipede. 



My mouth dropped to the floor as I stared up at it. Its mandibles snapped at me, its antenna twitched, and its enormous legs slammed against the floor of the tent. In that moment, any happy memory of my students was instantly replaced with the memory of me, at 12 years old, fighting for my life against Garibaldi on the night of my escape. My body began to tremble in fear, and suddenly I heard a horrible cackle. I stared at the crowd, wondering where it came from. And I was met with Garibaldi staring at me from the rafters of the bleachers. The bastard had his own private booth to watch me suffer. 



My moment of panic and fear was cut short when the centipede whipped its body against mine and sent me tumbling to the floor. I let out a loud gasp as all the air was knocked out of me. I tried to stand back up, only to be slammed back onto the floor by the centipede. My sword was knocked out of my hand and went spinning across the floor. I rolled out of the centipede’s way and tried to reach the sword. As I did so, the centipede slammed its mandibles into my face, and only my quick reaction time with the tiny shield spared me any major damage. 

  


As I struggled against the centipede, I began to hear boos coming from the crowd. In this moment of fighting for my life, they were booing me. I guess this is what a real gladiator must have felt in ancient Rome. I gritted my teeth and quickly pushed my full weight onto the shield and shoved the centipede out of my face. I rolled out of the way and quickly crawled to my sword. Grabbing it and turning, I managed to lunge forward and strike the centipede in the face as it pounced on me again. It let out a loud screech before disappearing into a cloud of black smoke. The whole tent was silent for a moment before the crowd again erupted into cheers. I shakily dropped the sword to the floor and looked out at the audience.



My heart was beating at a million miles an hour, and in that moment, with so many eyes staring at me, and having to relive that horrible night I had escaped the Freakshow, I turned and ran off the stage as fast as I could. Mathieu tried to reach out and grab me, but I ran past him. I ran straight out of the tent and into the Freakshow grounds. My crappy stamina soon caught up to me, as the stabbing pain of a cramp began to assail my left side. I came to a stop between two vacant booths and leaned on the light post that illuminated the Freakshow as the sun began to set. 



I panted uncontrollably, trying to calm down and waiting for the pain in my side to die down. I looked around the amusement part of the Freakshow and saw that most, if not all, of the posts were currently abandoned. It figured since everyone would most likely be watching the main show. Suddenly, from somewhere, I began to hear an out-of-tune melody. One that I had heard in my basement. I looked around for the source, seeing that a kid was staring at the box, which was sitting on one of the benches. 



I tried to shout to warn the kid away, he looked no older than an elementary school kid, but my voice was gone. It was barely above a squeak, and to my horror, I couldn’t alert the poor boy. I watched in horror as the box suddenly stopped its out-of-tune melody. And I watched as Kraft exploded out of the box. 



“You’re in for a surprise!” Kraft declared in its dual voice. The kid stepped back, but as he did, Kraft leaned down and bit him on the shoulder. The poor thing screamed as Kraft lifted them and tossed them into the air, before unhinging his jaw and swallowing the kid whole. I covered my mouth in horror and began to back up. That was when I heard a wet snap. I whipped my head to stare into the alley that separated the two shacks from each other. 



There, hunched over something, appeared to be Victor. He seemed to take notice of me as he turned to look at me. In his hands was a decapitated possum. And Victor’s mouth was stained by blood. He looked at me as he slowly opened his mouth. To my horror, I watched as he unhinged his jaw and stuffed the whole remaining possum down his throat. 



I turned and ran yet again, ignoring the throbbing pain in my side and the cries of my lungs. I ran in a blind panic, hoping that running away would take me away from all this yet again. But this wasn’t the same place it had been when I was a child. It was much worse. As if to prove that point, in my blind panic, I smashed my arm into the electric fence. An invisible force latched onto and grabbed me, shaking me violently before dropping me to the floor. I lay there, a column of smoke rising from my newly burned arm. The pain was so excruciating that it overloaded my senses, and for a brief moment, I lay there stunned and completely limp.



I stared up at the stars. As the pain slowly began to knock me unconscious, I wished upon the stars in heaven that I would wake up in my bed at home. I wished that things would just go back to normal. I finally closed my eyes and lost consciousness with this wish.

1mgraeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mgraeg/does_blackdecker_cm5000b_coffee_maker_stand_out/,Does BLACK+DECKER CM5000B Coffee Maker Stand Out? Comprehensive Review on Grind and Brew Features,"The BLACK+DECKER CM5000B 12-Cup Mill and Brew Coffee Maker instantly caught my attention with its promise to grind and brew fresh coffee effortlessly. As someone who considers coffee a daily ritual, I had high hopes for this product. Testing it over a month, I found plenty to like, though it wasn't without its imperfections.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The aesthetic appeal of this coffee maker is fantastic. Its black and stainless-steel finish strikes a modern and sleek vibe, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen. The lightweight design (9.5 pounds) makes it easy to move, and its compact yet functional dimensions (10""D x 13.5""W x 15.5""H) ensured it didn’t overcrowd my countertop. What I appreciated most was the clear, simple interface. The QuickTouch programming buttons were intuitive and didn’t need me to manually hunt for a manual online. I would’ve preferred the water reservoir to come with measurements that were slightly more visible, though; tilting my head awkwardly early in the morning wasn’t fun.

**Ease of Use and Programming**  
One of the standout features was its 24-hour auto brew programming. I loved setting it up at night, waking up to an aroma that filled the entire kitchen the next morning. The backlit display was helpful in low-light environments (coffee at midnight, anyone?). The brew strength selector gave me control over my caffeine fix, offering regular, bold, and strong options. Switching between whole coffee beans and pre-ground coffee was effortless, thanks to the integrated grind-off option.

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM5000B price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00lu2i46e/)  

**Grind and Brew Capability**  
The integrated grinder deserves a special mention. Freshly ground coffee tastes entirely different from using pre-ground options (at least in my opinion). The blades crushed the beans to perfection before brewing, capturing the rich aroma and full flavor each time I brewed a pot. However, the grinder was loud—something my spouse didn’t appreciate at 6 AM. Another small quibble was cleaning the grinder; though it’s removable, getting all the small coffee bits out felt tedious after a few uses.

**Pros**  
The product has several winning points:
- Customizable brew strength made it adaptable to various preferences.  
- Sneak-a-Cup feature, which hilariously saved me from spilling coffee while I poured mid-brew.  
- Reusable bronze-tone filter reduced the need for disposable filters, which I liked, both environmentally and monetarily.  

**Cons**  
However, the machine isn't without a few flaws:
- The loudness of the grinder can be jarring early in the morning.  
- Cleaning the grinding area takes extra time that might frustrate impatient users.  
- Lack of a keep-warm option beyond the warming plate slightly disappointed me.  

**Performance in Daily Operation**  
The CM5000B was reliable for consistent brewing. Whether I needed a casual couple of cups during a Zoom meeting or a nearly full 12-cup carafe for weekend brunch, it delivered every time. Its semi-automatic operation mode added convenience, although once during testing, I did end up shaking the grinder to unclog beans! This might not happen for pre-ground coffee lovers, but bean enthusiasts may encounter minor inconveniences.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Comparing it to well-known competitors, the CM5000B brought fresh bean preparation to the forefront like a champ. For instance, the Cuisinart DGB-900BC also offers grind-and-brew features but at a higher price point. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach 49989 Grind & Brew showcases a quieter grind mechanism, though it doesn’t offer a full 12-cup capacity. This BLACK+DECKER coffee maker excels in providing a balanced feature set but doesn’t quite match others in noise control or advanced app-enabled settings available on premium brands like Breville.

**Value for Money**  
For its price bracket, this product packs in plenty of features while still remaining accessible to the basic coffee enthusiast. I often found trade-offs between cost and convenience in other products, but here the balance shines through fairly well. The reusable filter alone provided measurable value through cost savings over time. In my experience, the BLACK+DECKER CM5000B manages to feel worth every penny without veering into luxury-territory pricing.

1mgra6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1mgra6j/i_22_m_am_feeling_really_alone_after_finding_out/,I (22 M) am feeling really alone after finding out a girl I’ve been into for a while has a BF,"For some quick context I’m an auto technician. If anyone else here is an auto tech they’ll agree work becomes a lot of your life for many reasons, inconsistent pay, friends and family coming to you, and stress from work coming home with you. I often feel very lonely, while I am doing financially much better than people I graduated from hs with, I really don’t have much of a social life. I’m sure I can find better balance or a better job etc, but rn for me it’s about maximizing income trying to pay off student debt. I wasn’t fortunate to find a partner in hs or the little bit I was in college like a good amount of people. I work really long hours. Main job as an auto technician 6 days a week 8-5 and also a second job in retail 6-10 closing 3 nights a week. Again, I choose this like I said just trying to get ahead financially and lose my debt. It’s really really lonely, I find it hard trying to be friends with people at work because our job gets in the way or I’m just not connecting with similar interests. My retail job is mostly teens or young adults who don’t have much work ethic which I guess for me makes it hard to want to be their friends as I just resent them most of the time I’m at work with them. Needless to say, I don’t have many friends, and I’m never meeting women. I do, go get coffee almost daily with a coworker where I’ve met a few baristas I’ve been interested in and made small talk only to find out they’re taken often indirectly. One girl in particular works at the Local Harbor Freight, I go often needing tools being a tech. We’ve had really good conversation and what I thought was chemistry over the last few months to the point where I could say we’re friends in that we recognize each other, talk about some personal stuff here and there and she notices details about me as I’ve changed hair, if I haven’t been there in a while etc. Two weeks ago before I went on vacation I decided I thought we seemed to have good chemistry and I found myself looking forward to seeing her and talking. I told her I was going to be hiking and she was telling me she’s really been wanting to go so I told her like hey I go a lot so if she’s interested we could talk more about it next time we see each other and she agreed. I see her today and I told her I hadn’t seen here there yet this week (I went a few times) she told me it was her birthday this week and her boyfriend took her to festival and got an air bnb etc and she was really happy and excited telling me about it, and I just fought so hard to stay happy and ask her about it. It just really hit hard, I’m not upset with her obviously she’s just being her and like I said happy to tell a friend about something exciting in her life. Needless to say I’m devastated personally because this is the first real connection I felt I was making to someone in a long time and on top of that one where I was starting to feel chemistry and it wasn’t just physical attraction. Just feeling really lonely and kind of stuck where I guess since I’m prioritizing saving money and paying off debt it’s my own fault I’m so isolated. I don’t want people to take this as me being upset with her. The positive from this is it really seems I’ve made a friend that I see somewhat consistently. It just hurts because I feel chemistry and she’s in a relationship and it’s hard to accept that. I will not make a problem of it but I’m also not sure if I will maybe distance myself and not talk to her as much anymore because I just don’t think it’s right to be friends with someone you have feelings for. I guess I’ll need to sit with my feelings for a while but right now I just feel hopeless for ever finding a partner.",2,1754247345.0,loneliness,0,1.0,False

But nope. All about her still.
My dad has Alzheimers disease and I've been his main caretaker for the past 3ish years. But he recently got diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. It's an extremely aggressive cancer that kills you very fast. He is 83 years old, 121 pounds and has kidney disease. He is not a candidate for treatment. I've been sobbing on and off, while still trying to work and care for him. My heart is breaking.
When I get on the phone with my mom, it's all about her. I found this out about a week ago and she said we'll, it's ok to cry on the first day but after that you should stop...and then starts rambling on about the cable company giving her a refund, but she had to walk down to Starbucks to buy something to get change for something else and she went on and on about how she doesn't even drink coffee and it was just so ridiculous. I was silent and finally just hung up. Then she tells my aunt that she couldn't believe that I was so silent on the phone.
She is so self-absorbed and I know not to be surprised but it's really disgusting to me and going no contact is going to be really easy because I literally cannot stand her. God forbid I mourn my dad's impending death and suffering.

1mgr5sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mgr5sv/how_does_kitchenaid_kcm5912sx_cold_brew_maker/,How Does KitchenAid KCM5912SX Cold Brew Maker Enhance Your Coffee?,"The KitchenAid KCM5912SX has become a regular part of my kitchen routine, bringing a whole new level of convenience and deliciousness to my mornings. As someone who can’t function without coffee, the promise of making up to 38 ounces of smooth cold brew concentrate at home was just too tempting to pass up. After putting it through its paces for weeks, I can confidently say this cold brew coffee maker delivers some serious positives, but it also comes with minor hiccups worth pointing out. 

**Smooth, Flavorful Coffee at Your Fingertips**  
What sets this product apart is the remarkably smooth coffee it produces. Following the instructions, I filled the included stainless-steel steeper with coarse coffee grounds, poured cold water over it, and let it steep in the fridge for about 12 hours. The result? A rich, full-bodied cold brew without any of the harsh, acidic notes you’d expect from cheaper brewing methods. It’s also tailored for versatility—whether you like it with milk, cream, or just poured over ice, the customizable concentrate ensures you get your perfect cup every time.

**Built for Convenience and Portability**  
The design features a compact footprint that slips neatly into my moderately crowded fridge without taking up excessive space. Its built-in stainless steel tap makes pouring coffee a breeze. I love that I don’t need to tilt or tip anything; a gentle press lets you dispense the concentrate straight into your mug. And while the carrying handle might seem like a small touch, it’s surprisingly useful when you want to shift it from the fridge to the counter or even take it outdoors for a small gathering.  

[Want KitchenAid KCM5912SX? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07g4w8s7k/)  

**Materials That Add a Touch of Class**  
KitchenAid didn’t skimp on aesthetics or functionality here. The combination of a glass carafe and brushed stainless-steel components not only elevates its stylish appearance but also plays a crucial role in preserving the coffee’s flavor. I’ve used similar products with plastic components before, and there’s often some odd aftertaste. With this unit, every drop of coffee tastes as fresh as it should, even if it’s been sitting in the fridge for days.  

**Advantages**  
• Effortless brewing process with easy-to-follow instructions  
• Compact design fits snugly in the fridge  
• High-quality materials preserve coffee’s taste  
• Reusable stainless-steel steeper reduces the need for disposable filters  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• The steeping time of 12-24 hours demands a bit of patience, especially if you’re craving coffee immediately.  
• Cleaning the stainless-steel tap is slightly fussy. While the other components are easy to clean, I had to spend extra minutes ensuring the tap was spotless to avoid any residue build-up.  
• For those on a tight budget, this might seem overpriced compared to simpler cold brew systems available.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other cold brew machines like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker or the OXO Compact Cold Brew, the KitchenAid cold brew coffee maker matches them on flavor quality but surpasses in terms of design. The Takeya product relies heavily on plastic components, making it less durable over time, while the OXO compact model, despite being excellent on space efficiency, doesn’t provide as much brewing capacity. However, Takeya’s system is faster to clean, and the OXO option is more affordable—two points worth considering depending on priorities.

**Smart Spending**  
While the initial sticker shock might make you think twice, the features and reliability of this cold brew maker justify the splurge. It’s not just about making coffee; it’s about consistently delivering a café-level experience without leaving your house. When comparing it to daily coffee shop prices, you’ll likely break even within a few months.

The thing is I pulled another great Plusle (first pokeworld problems) and now I'm not sure on what to do. I want some advice from advanced players or some that have a similar playstyle, because investing on these little mouses is very expensive on main skill seeds. I'm not shy of spending on good bundles so it's not impossible, but it's slow. 

I always aim for Helping Bonus, my core is always Raikou, Dedenne and Pawmot and focus full on cooking. The other two slots are always switching for the ingredients I need or for pot expanding skills, so I don't use any berry mon whatsoever. I have to check the game very often to pull this and it's kinda minmaxer sometimes.

So the possible teams:
- ingredient overload
I could very possible start the day with 120 ingredientes (48 coffee and 72 random) and adapt through the day to get the dishes I want but if I use this team all day I would end up selling a lot of the ingredients and fully using the Helping Bonus. Still the randomness could add some fun and adapt to the situation and even open space through the day to use other types of pokemon

- Wake Up Exp +
This Minun could speed up the game with the Sleep Exp subskill and also cover for pot expanding on mornings, very solid and balanced option, but it's not the better option to use during the day. 

- Faster Minun 
This I could use better during the day because of the speed so it isn't wasted during the night and also be kind of a semi healer if I leave it on the team switching Pawmot for a specific ingredient mon. 

As you can see I aim for a flexible style and Raenonx doesn't do well calculating this kind of things, so I can't fully rely on it for this.

So here’s the thing: getting up, like getting my ass out of the bed is still very hard. I had a lovely dog in my last relationship & he was an angel that really helped me get up, but since being single again this year — I’m back at multiple snoozes and don’t wake as naturally (even with my SO)
:(

I’ve tried both but armodafinil or Nuvigil works better for me (less irritation). I realized once I was needing 200mg upon waking it tended to make me a bit neurotic, agitated. I was weirdly fidgeting and rubbing my arms a lot. I stopped it for a while but I keep oversleeping. I have other mental health conditions, so I’m back on a low dose mood stabilizer and it seems I can get away with a low, 50mg tablet here & there to just  get me up and at it, but I still feel it isn’t the greatest for my mood. 

I’m wondering if there are any supplements people have used for this reason *besides* a straight caffeine pill? A caffeine pill seems it’d be short lived & hard on my heart since I also drink some coffee and have some issues with tachycardia. 

I also have a sunrise clock which helps but like, until I can afford to get a doggo — I’m struggling to get moving. Especially after 2 surgeries this year on my ankle so I have stiffness and need to wake up a little earlier to stretch and get moving.

1mgqvay,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mgqvay/can_brensten_replacement_charcoal_water_filters/,Can Brensten Replacement Charcoal Water Filters Elevate Your Keurig Coffee? Honest Review Inside,"The BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 Pack of 6 Replacement Charcoal Water Filters has been a game-changer in my daily coffee-making routine. As someone relying on a Keurig brewer for my morning cup of caffeine, I felt compelled to take a closer look at this product. After days of testing, I’m here to share my personal experience, both good and not-so-good, while using these replacement charcoal filters. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t entirely smooth sailing, but the positives definitely outweighed the negatives.

**Build Quality and Material Choice**  
The charcoal filters are made of carbon fiber, boasting a lightweight yet sturdy build. Measuring approximately 2-1/8"" x 1-1/4"" x 1-1/4"", they slide effortlessly into the water reservoir of my Keurig brewer. I appreciated their minimalistic basket-like design, which doesn’t complicate the installation process, even for someone with zero experience in changing filters. They feel premium enough for their purpose, and though lightweight at only 3.52 ounces, each filter packs a punch in terms of utility.

**Ease of Installation**  
I’m not exactly the most tech-savvy person, yet installing these filters didn’t feel like rocket science. The instructions provided were straightforward, and the filters took no more than a minute or two to get in place. Unlike some competing products where fitting can turn into an infuriating guessing game, this was refreshingly uneventful. However, I did notice that the snug fit depends on having an original Keurig filter holder, which might be a hassle for first-time buyers who don’t have a starter kit.

**Advantages**  
- Impressive ability to reduce chlorine, calcium, and odors from tap water.  
- Compatible with a broad range of Keurig models, from 2.0 systems to older Single Cup Reservoir machines.  
- Noticeable difference in the coffee’s aroma and taste after installation.  
- Affordable, producing a significant improvement in coffee quality without a hefty price tag.

[See BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 deals on Amazon now.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09z64rmt7/)

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
One noteworthy aspect is how quickly these filters improve water quality. After only a day of use, I could taste the difference in my coffee. The improved aroma and lack of bitterness were undeniable—my coworkers at the office noticed it, too! It’s worth mentioning that each filter is rated to last for about 60 tank refills or approximately 60 days. I haven’t yet hit the end of the lifespan for the first filter, but the consistency in performance so far is commendable. 

**Negatives**  
- Slight compatibility hiccups with non-Keurig machines or models outside the recommended range.  
- Filters don’t come with a holder, so you’ll need an original Keurig filter starter kit for first use.  
- No ""change indicator"" feature, making it easy to forget when to replace a used filter.  

**Target Users Who Will Benefit Most**  
This product is ideal for households or workplaces where a Keurig coffee maker is in heavy use. If you’ve ever cringed at the off-taste of hard water in your coffee or worried about mineral build-up ruining your pricey coffee machine, these filters prove to be a reliable and economical solution. A friend of mine, who had nearly given up on her Keurig due to poor water quality, swears by them now. However, they won’t be particularly useful for non-Keurig users, nor do they have features for those who need a reminder to replace filters regularly.

**Competing Products**  
There are other charcoal filters on the market, like the GoldTone Charcoal Water Filters or the PureGreen Universal Keurig Filters—both popular choices among coffee aficionados. Compared to these, the BRENSTEN product shines for its affordability and ease of installation. While GoldTone may come with slightly sturdier packaging and PureGreen emphasizes broader compatibility, neither hit the perfect balance of price and performance as seen here. That said, this product lacks the ""premium grade"" branding some competitors flaunt, which might win points with certain buyers.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the overall improvement in coffee flavor and the long-term protection it offers to your Keurig machine, the price-to-quality ratio here is well above average. You get six filters in a single package, making it a highly economical choice for long-term coffee drinkers. By extending the lifespan of my Keurig brewer and delivering a consistently better coffee experience, these filters justify their cost tenfold. Frequent buyers of coffee shop beverages would likely see significant savings shifting to home-brewed coffee using filtered water.

1mgqs21,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeGearReviews/comments/1mgqs21/explore_the_hessaire_mc37v_portable_evaporative/,Explore the Hessaire MC37V Portable Evaporative Cooler review for powerful home cooling!,"The Hessaire MC37V Mobile Evaporative Cooler has been my loyal companion during the blazing summer days. As someone living in an area notorious for its dry heat, a cooling solution is not a luxury—it's a necessity. I got the opportunity to test this portable evaporative cooler, and it has truly been a game-changer. While it certainly has its strengths, there are also points worth considering before committing to it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This unit boasts a sleek yet functional design that doesn't trade aesthetics for durability. Made of polypropylene resin, the cooler is impressively lightweight without feeling flimsy and is robust enough to withstand daily use. Its gray tone blends into almost any space, which is a plus if you're concerned about home decor. Rolling the cooler around is hassle-free thanks to its four heavy-duty locking casters. Moving it between my living room and patio became such an effortless task that I found myself doing it more than expected. With dimensions of 34 x 17 x 24 inches and weighing just 40 pounds, the device feels compact for something capable of cooling up to 950 square feet.  

**Ease of Use and Settings**  
Operating the cooler is straightforward, even for the most gadget-averse individuals. Three rotary dials control fan speed, the water pump, and the oscillation motor independently. I appreciated the simplicity of this design because it meant less fiddling with overly complicated digital panels. I'm someone who likes a cool breeze while working at my desk and a stronger gust while entertaining guests on my patio. This cooler nailed it with its three fan speeds and oscillating louvers, which spread cool air evenly across the room. The intuitive controls made adjusting settings a breeze—no pun intended.  

[Check Hessaire MC37V price on Amazon.](https://ehomeco.com/p/b07cjwdgdj/)  

**Cooling Performance**  
Living in a dry climate, I rely heavily on devices like these to combat the heat, and this cooler didn't disappoint. It delivers 3,100 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of airflow, enough to make my open-layout kitchen and living room feel downright chilly. What really stood out were the high-density cooling pads on three sides of the machine. These pads increase the evaporative surface area, which means more efficient cooling—something you instantly notice as you step in and feel the difference. While tested, the results were notable: the room temperature dropped significantly within minutes of turning the cooler on. However, keep in mind that evaporative coolers like this work best in dry climates and might not perform as well in humid conditions.  

**Water Fill Options and Maintenance**  
For those who dread frequent refills, this cooler has you covered. It allows both manual and continuous water filling. During my busy workweek, attaching a garden hose to the included float adapter proved to be a lifesaver. The cooler maintained water levels autonomously, sparing me from constant monitoring. For those rare moments when manual filling was necessary, the process was fairly simple, just like topping off a coffee maker. Maintenance is equally undemanding. Cleaning out the water tank and pads felt like a minor task, and the high-density cooling pads seemed built to last. If only all appliances were this straightforward to maintain!

**Highlights**  
- Compact and aesthetically pleasing design for easy placement in any space.  
- Portable with heavy-duty locking casters for hassle-free mobility.  
- Straightforward rotary controls for fan, pump, and oscillation motor.  
- Continuous fill option significantly reduces the hassle of manual refilling.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Still, being picky left me wondering how this cooler could have been better:  
- The unit operates at 250 watts, which isn’t the most energy-efficient.  
- Without proper ventilation, the air can start feeling too damp over time.  
- Incredibly dry climates might require more frequent use of the water pump.  
- The oscillating louvers spread air well but can’t be adjusted too precisely.  

**Competitive Options**  
When I compared this product to other evaporative coolers on the market, like the Honeywell CO60PM and the Luma Comfort EC111B, some interesting differences emerged. The Honeywell model offers better water capacity but lacks the portability I found so handy with this unit. Meanwhile, Luma comes at a slightly lower price point and energy efficiency but simply doesn't match the airflow power of the Hessaire MC37V. What sets this product apart is its balance of solid cooling performance, lightweight frame, and user-friendly operation—a trifecta not many others can claim convincingly.

**Value Proposition**  
Understanding the value of this cooler relative to its market peers, I’d say it’s a fair contender. It leans slightly on the pricier side of portable coolers but for good reasons. The materials used, innovative water filling options, effective cooling across large spaces, and those high-density pads demonstrate that this isn't just another disposable summer gadget. Given all these features, you can see why this unit holds a solid place in its portable air cooling niche. If you’re after a cooler that’s both effective and hassle-free, this one ticks many boxes.

Bit sarcastic, mostly bored and mostly here. If I won't reply I'm either busy working, playing games or just lazy to check, but hey, trying my best! I can annoy you with random shts, sky or sunset pics out of nowhere, or just hypnotize you with my eyes👀. 

I'm rock listener, shows watcher and gamer (mentioned above). I prefer long-term chats, that's always nice, I'm havin hard time remembering names, so if you'll say yours, I'll have to scroll up😅. If we click, we can move somewhere else, as this crap is laggy or not working properly most, of the time. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I'm not gonna call with you, but I have no problem with voice notes I guess.

But they have a fun sourcing program, well dialed coffee and some fun drinks like shakerados. His wife makes all the mugs they use too. Right now they have Flower Child, Obadiah and Poem. Had a washed Sidra from Flower Child on espresso and it was excellent 👌

Jung is infamous for *not* experimenting with drugs, though accused of it, as mentioned above—on Dalí—many greater minds all consumed Alcohol (ethanol).

**Caffeine is a sardonic *Methamphetamine* known as Methylxanthine; so, a mere cup of coffee or tea is a drug.**

In the common area, we have two couches. Our plan was to swap the smaller couch for a tiny IKEA table with two chairs so guests have a spot to eat or work. So far, no one’s complained about the lack of a table. We do have two side tables by each couch and a coffee table, and I’m guessing most people just eat on the couch. 

The table and chairs are already ordered, but we’re dragging our feet on selling the small couch because we can’t tell if guests actually prefer or want a dining table or if they prefer a second couch. Most reservations are for a max of 2 adults and occasionally a kid as well. Would a table make a noticeable difference or are we overthinking this? 2nd Couch vs. table: what’s the move?
