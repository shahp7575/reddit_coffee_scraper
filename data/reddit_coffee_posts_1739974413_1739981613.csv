I'm trying to make a narrower version of [this ](https://www.bouclair.com/en/furniture/side-tables/black-wood-side-table-9405184M.html)end table I found online. I'm hoping to be able to build it using either a 1"" thick, 8"" wide board of basswood, or a 1"" thick sheet of handy panel because I have those on hand. 

Looking at the [assembly instructions](https://www.bouclair.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-masterCatalog_bouclair/default/dwa5ea4e9f/documents/9405183_9405184_AI.pdf) it seems like they use dowels and screws to secure the joints. I'm wondering if I'd be able to do something like that. I have a pocket hole jig. Should/could I use that to make holes for dowels? Would that work on wood that is only 1"" thick?

Could I get away with using just wood glue? I'm just going to be putting coffee on the table.

Or maybe there is a better way to secure a joint like that. 

I have access to: drill, drill press, miter saw, router, table saw, band saw, jointer, planer, basic hand tools (I'm renting in a makerspace). 

Thanks for any suggestions you might have. 

Here is a picture of the table in case the link doesn't work:

1it95bl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1it95bl,Abused chow rehabilitation story üñ§,"Last slide is almost 4 years ago, when he first was adopted! 

I wanted to share this wonderful story with some people that would appreciate it. How I found my best friend, Baloo. 

Around 4 years ago, my sweet mother who is heavily involved with Akita rescue foundations (and has 2 of her own), fostered a chow chow in poor condition. He was on death row at his shelter and they considered him ‚Äúlame,‚Äù intended on euthanizing him due to damage from heart worms, arthritis, malnutrition, and evidence of abuse. 

The day I came home and saw him gated off in her bathroom, my heart broke for him. He was petrified of people- could not look at anyone, but was non-aggressive. Just a big scared baby in pain. I would spend time with him in the bathroom daily, and fall asleep on the tile floor with him just to be near him. Within 2 weeks, I quickly made the decision to adopt him myself. I just wanted him to feel love. 

Shortly after, we decided on an injection treatment for his heartworms. They said that it would be most effective, but he ran the risk of not surviving the treatment if he moved around a lot in the month following treatment. So we bought a very large kennel that he stayed in, inside the living room to be around my family, spent time with him and kept him relaxed and as still as possible. 

He survived the treatment and was heartworm free- and the real fun began! I knew he needed to be gently socialized, so I immediately began taking him with me everywhere I went. We would spend time in big parks together, coffee shops, and really anywhere that I knew he could see people and not feel extremely intimidated. 

He slowly began to come out of his shell, and began to love attention from people! Remaining shy, but appreciating gentle pets and loving. He started displaying little spurts of excited energy lasting just a couple minutes, where he would jump around a room and chase his tail. I can‚Äôt explain the joy that seeing HIM finally feel joy brought me. 

He became increasingly more affectionate, and began jumping up onto couches to lay on top of me. He now looks at me with full eye contact, he has become my shadow, and even occasionally licks me when he‚Äôs feeling extra sweet. 

Over the course of 4 years I have gotten married and had a baby (now 1 year old), who he‚Äôs fully adjusted to as of recently. They share snacks together, play together, and he is the best big dog brother to my son. 

He has completely taken a 180- physically, and in temperament. He is truly the most loving, happy, and friendly pup I have ever known. He wasn‚Äôt deemed to have a long life span at the start, but 4 years in we are going STRONG, with little to no health concerns. 

I have loved watching Baloo blossom over the years, he is my best friend and truly my soulmate in doggy form. I hope this story brings a little joy to your days! üñ§",1,1739981454.0,chowchow,0,1.0,False

I had been warming Silk Unsweetened Almond milk and brewing onto that when i wanted a milk based coffee but always wondered what advantage a milk frother would provide. Well I just bought a cheap frother from Amazon and only used it twice so far but both times were disappointing (of course I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing). So far I have tried full fat organic milk and the previously mentioned almond milk. My frother has settings for thick foam, light foam, warm only, and cold foam. Both times I used the light foam setting and about 4-6 oz of milk. The first try was with the organic milk and the result was a lot of very thick foam that tasted great but not what I was after. The second try was with almond milk and it resulted in less foam (good) but horrible burnt taste (bad). 

Experienced folk on here can probably spot my mistakes right off,  and I am looking for suggestions. From reading about frothers on here they all seem to have a short life so i didn‚Äôt want to invest in an expensive unit and that may have been one mistake, but I assume that the type of milk used has a lot to do with it too.

I wonder how you are doing these days. You probably feel peaceful, as you've always said you'd feel if we let each other go. You probably don't have any worries about how fucked up things could get if people would find out about us. Probably.

Most days, I'm doing okay. I'm starting to forget how your face looks like, despite wanting to remember it for the rest of this lifetime. You know what I remember? I remember your voice in my head, it's as if I could tell the lowest and highest notes in your laughter. I remember how we'd tease each other about being malandi, and how we'd do intimate things together over the phone. I mean, why sugarcoat things, right? But what is intimacy if not with you. 

""I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met...""

I honestly don't know what I want to tell you exactly. I guess, I just want to let you know that I miss you so much, it still hurts. I still connect Cubao and Grab rides home with your memories. How you liked your ramen, and that I should just request oatmilk for your coffee. It's beautifully haunting.

But there's also peace in acceptance. Somehow, I've managed to build a new life without you in it, in small little pieces. I guess we have already fulfilled the roles we're supposed to play in each other's life. Our last meeting has already concluded.

Until next lifetime, love.

Advice?","I met a woman while caring for my mother at the hospital, and over time, we built a connection. She‚Äôs a single mother of six who has been through a lot‚Äîlosing her husband two years ago, dealing with a complicated relationship with her MIL of her first husband, whom she had five kids from, and recently breaking up with a partner after discovering his infidelity. She‚Äôs been struggling emotionally and financially, and I‚Äôve tried to support her in whatever ways I can.

She was extremely close to her nan, who had raised her, and losing her was devastating. She desperately wanted to be there for the funeral, which was held in another state, but finances made it incredibly difficult. Her MIL, despite having received financial help from her in the past, refused to assist her in getting there. Eventually, she managed to make the trip, but it was tough on her, both emotionally and financially. Once the funeral was over, she faced another challenge‚Äîshe was essentially stranded interstate, unable to afford a flight back home. It took time and effort for her to gather the funds to return, making an already painful experience even more exhausting for her.

I made my intentions clear to her early on, and in response, she opened up about her past relationships and how both of her previous partners were unfaithful. She admitted she‚Äôs lost trust in men and isn‚Äôt ready for anything serious. I‚Äôve respected that, giving her space while still being there for her when she needs someone to talk to.

It‚Äôs been about three months since I met her, and while I‚Äôve done my best to be supportive, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm wasting my time trying to build something with her. Every time I try to get closer, she doesn‚Äôt seem to reciprocate. Instead, she gives excuses‚Äîsaying she‚Äôs sick or that something else is going on‚Äîyet I still find myself being there for her.

I‚Äôve helped her financially whenever I could afford to, giving her $150 when she sped at one state. However, I would often giving her more than she asked for during other times. When she needed a loan of $60 or $70, I gave her $100 each time. Recently, when she asked how much she owed me back, I only counted the amounts she originally requested, not the extra I gave her. I also paid for her phone credit when she needed it, helped her with arrangements for her nan‚Äôs funeral when her MIL refused to, and tried to make things a little easier for her and her kids. On her son‚Äôs birthday, I bought him toys and his birthday cake and drove them to the store to get it and back. On the way back to the birthday party, I treated her and her kids to a bunch of frozen drinks. Ona separate occasion, I took her out on a simple, no-pressure outing, where I got us some KFC and coffee, and we ate at a park. I‚Äôve never made any inappropriate advances or pressured her into anything.

Just recently, she told me she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. When I asked what was wrong, several times, she barely got around to saying she had flu-like symptoms. I suggested she get plenty of vitamin C and mentioned which foods are rich in it, with guava being the most vitamin C-dense whole food. I asked if I could get her something, and she requested guavas, but they‚Äôre not in season yet. I told her she could try megadosing with vitamin C until April, when guavas would be available again.

Then she asked if I could send her $50 for some ingredients like ginger and other things. I offered to go buy them for her, but she said her sister-in-law was already at the shops and had asked if she needed anything. So I sent her the $50 instead.

I don‚Äôt know what the future holds, but at this point, I‚Äôm questioning if I‚Äôm just wasting my time. I‚Äôd expect her to initiate some things too, but that hasn‚Äôt really happened. I‚Äôve been patient and understanding, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I should take a step back.",3,1739980830.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I started having side effects so I called and asked if it's okay if I can split the pill to 2.5 they said it's okay. 

I've been on 2.5 of amlodipine for almost 2 months. My at-home blood pressure usually ranges between 120 and 133. But usually in the morning and afternoon when I check it it's anywhere between 120 and 127 if I'm sitting still for about 10 to 15 minutes. 

I have no genetic history of high blood pressure even though I know it can happen without genetic history. I went to the cardiologist before seeing the doctor about my blood pressure and my heart and all the valves are fine also did a EKG and stress test. Everything's fine and so is my blood work kidneys and such. 

If I'm being quite honest I think my biggest problem is smoking. Cigarettes and marijuana and caffeine. I've decided to make a lifestyle change and drop marijuana and coffee. Or if I cannot drop coffee switch the decaf and have a higher intake of water as I don't drink enough water as is. 

But I do believe the main culprit is cigarettes. I tried to quit on Wellbutrin. But I was never truly ready to quit however now I'm seeing that maybe quitting would be better than having to be on blood pressure medication tbh 

I had health anxiety but that has also subsided since I've started realizing that for the most part all my tests are normal and relatively active and healthy. 

it's just how do I relate this type of information to my doctor as I try telling him before that my blood pressure readings are within the normal range maybe a little elevated but I strongly believe it's because of life style choices. 

I don't want to be stuck on this pill if I don't have to. If that makes sense ",1,1739980790.0,hypertension,5,1.0,False

The problem? We don‚Äôt know Vegas either, and we have no idea where she is. My wife tries to guide her first, but it goes nowhere. I take over and ask where she is. First, she says the Stratosphere. I ask if she's in the parking lot or just sees it. She admits she just sees it. She then tells me the name of a nearby business, so I direct her to pull out of the lot, take a left, and tell me what street she passes.

She immediately ignores me and goes right instead‚Äîbecause that felt more correct.

What follows is 15 more minutes of this. Somehow, after a series of wrong turns, yelling street names that don‚Äôt make sense, and MIL making her own executive decisions mid-instruction, we finally get her to the restaurant.


---

**Day One: The Store**

After spending the day at Area 15, we stopped by a store to grab some coffee and tea for the hotel, so that we don't have to spend money on Starbucks (there's no coffee machine in the room) MIL decided she needed groceries too. We explained that she‚Äôd have to leave them in her car while we went to dinner, but she didn‚Äôt understand why. Instead, she insisted, ""I can just put them in your room.""

Translation: We would now be carrying all of her groceries from the parking garage, through the casino, and up to our room. We told her this was ridiculous. She didn‚Äôt listen.

To make things worse, she had apparently hurt her arm, so she couldn't carry anything herself. The entire time, she walked around clutching her arm and wincing dramatically.

The worst part? Getting through the shopping center. MIL could not resist any distraction. Every store. Every sample. Every person handing out flyers. We kept telling her to ignore them, but she wouldn‚Äôt. She actually almost walked into multiple stores before we could stop her.

Finally, we got her groceries up to the room. Now she wanted to take a nap before dinner. Fine. But we also had Cirque tickets that night, and, surprise surprise‚Äîafter her nap, she decided she no longer felt like she could walk to the show. So, we had to cancel. 

---

**Day One: Dinner & Getting the Boomer Home**

Once MIL woke up, we found a simple dinner option within the hotel, and got her downstairs. She managed to stand in the way of multiple people, looking completely lost and confused.

After dinner, we went back to our room to get her groceries. That‚Äôs when she dropped this on us:

*""I don‚Äôt feel safe driving off the Strip.""*

We knew this was coming. My wife and I had already texted about it and had a plan. We‚Äôd Uber her home.

As we‚Äôre gathering her things, she starts fumbling with her keys, trying to get her garage door opener off the keyring. She then decides she doesn‚Äôt want to carry the groceries after all and tells us to just bring them to her tomorrow when we pick her up. At this point, I‚Äôm exhausted and frustrated, so I just agree.

We walk her downstairs, get her into an Uber, and send her off into the night. Day One: Over.

---

**Except‚Ä¶ It Wasn‚Äôt.**

After all that fumbling with her keys, she took them with her. Instead of leaving them behind, i assumed she had left them on the bed or dresser or somewhere logical while she was fumbling with them. Guess she put them back in her purse. Who knows why. 

So now, we had no way to get her car to her the next day. And to top it off, she refused to ask her roommate for a ride to pick them up. Why? Because she ""didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience her."" 

Both of them are retired. They have nothing but time.

**And that was just Day One.**  ",5,1739980754.0,BoomersBeingFools,5,1.0,False

I have a problem with my sage/breville barista express. I have it for about 3 years and it should be the 9 bar model. And now to the problem. When I make an espresso, usually 18g in, 36g out in around 30 seconds, the presure gauge needle show high pressure, above the espresso range, marked in red in the picture. What I have read, that is 14-16 bar. 9 bar is around the marked green. When i set the grind, so that it shows around 9 bars, the coffee flows very quickly. What could be the problem? I clean and descaled it every month.

Thanks for the advice

Hi there, I am wondering if I should return my new machine, or if there is something I am doing wrong.

I‚Äôve been freelancing in creative fields (mainly branding and web design) for the past five years, and as much as I love the freedom, it can get a bit lonely, especially when you‚Äôre not bouncing ideas off other people.

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôm missing that spark from chatting with like-minded people, so I‚Äôd love to meet others in Prague who are in similar fields (designers, writers, photographers, musicians, filmmakers). Maybe grab coffee, brunch?

If there are any groups (WhatsApp, Facebook, Slack, whatever) that I should know about, I‚Äôd love a heads-up. Or feel free to drop a comment or DM.

Former brewery owner/ head brewer turned coffee roaster here. I‚Äôve been roasting all our coffee used in beer production for years. Recently decided to venture out on my own. 

Lately I‚Äôve been honing my process of fermenting, drying and roasting my own secondary co-ferments. More as a fun side project but also to see if I can avoid some of the glaring fermentation flaws in some of the ‚Äúfunkier‚Äù co ferments I have had direct from farms. 

It‚Äôs definitely a labor of love, as I‚Äôd only be able to produce roughly 3-5kg a week. Being limited in space to dry the fermented coffee is currently my bottle neck, but man they are tasting amazing. Super clean, snappy acidity, vibrant fruit flavors without overwhelming the coffee base. My most recent batch is a fruity Ethiopian fermented with lemon, blueberry and honey fermented with a champagne yeast. The roasted coffees do look a bit different than a normal been. They visually looks darker due to the extra sugar content but once ground show the true roast level. 

I‚Äôve done roughly 50 trials with various fruits, fermentables and yeasts, and would like to start offering them on my website. 

What‚Äôs size packaging would you all think is reasonable, 4 oz? 6 oz? Any interesting flavor combinations you‚Äôd like to try?",5,1739979827.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

I've touched on this topic before, but I wanted to make a post that might benefit someone.



In college, I was always impressed by people who dedicated a lot of time to studying and took their lessons seriously. To motivate myself, I would choose either a real person I admired or create an ideal character in my mind who does all the right things I aspire to do.



Then I'd choose a time, and I'd act like this character for a day, half a day, or even just 3-4 hours. I'd prepare a clean space for studying the night before, and then I'd gather all my favorite things for the study session (my favorite pens, my favorite clothes, a blanket, a candle, fancy coffee) to try and make it ""enjoyable"" and aesthetically pleasing.



When the time comes, I sit down and embody the character. I think like them. It's a nice feeling to pretend that your life is a little bit put together.



You can apply the same thing to your work. Imagine someone with the same job title as you who is organized and does all the right things carefully and meticulously. The person who might get a promotion. Then choose a day and embody their character.



""What would they be doing right now?""



""How would they handle this situation?""



""How would they take action on this matter?""



It's fun, motivating, and rewarding. It's worth a try.

# Benefits and Challenges of Living and Working in Colombia as a Digital Nomad

Living and working in Colombia as a digital nomad can offer a blend of vibrant culture, beautiful landscapes, and a relatively low cost of living. However, like any lifestyle choice, it comes with its own set of benefits and challenges. Let's dive into what you need to know to make an informed decision.

# Cost of Living

The cost of living in Colombia is one of its most attractive features for digital nomads. Cities like Medellin and Bogota offer a high quality of life at a fraction of the cost compared to many Western countries. For instance, you can find comfortable accommodations for under $400 per month, and a decent meal at a local restaurant can cost as little as $3.50. This affordability extends to other expenses such as transportation and entertainment, making it easier to stretch your budget further.

|Expense|Bogota|Medellin|Barranquilla|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One-bedroom apartment in city center|$250 - $500|$300 - $600|$200 - $400|
|Meal at inexpensive restaurant|$2.50 - $5.00|$3.00 - $5.50|$2.00 - $4.50|
|Internet (60 Mbps or faster)|$20 - $30|$25 - $35|$15 - $25|

# Cultural Immersion

Colombia's rich cultural tapestry offers digital nomads a chance to immerse themselves in a diverse array of traditions, festivals, and cuisines. From the salsa dancing in Cali to the coffee plantations in Manizales, there‚Äôs no shortage of experiences. Additionally, the friendly locals often welcome foreigners, making it easy to integrate into the community. This cultural richness not only enhances your personal experience but also provides ample opportunities for networking and building relationships that can be beneficial professionally.

# Infrastructure and Connectivity

While major cities like Bogota, Medellin, and Cartagena boast modern infrastructure, internet connectivity can still be a challenge in some areas. High-speed internet is generally available in urban centers, but rural areas may lag behind. For instance, Medellin has been recognized as one of the smartest cities in Latin America, with reliable and fast internet services. However, in smaller towns or rural settings, finding consistent, high-speed internet might require some extra effort.

* Medellin: Reliable high-speed internet
* Bogota: Mixed reviews, but generally good coverage
* Cartagena: Good in tourist areas, less so in residential zones

# Healthcare

Colombia‚Äôs healthcare system is considered one of the best in Latin America, offering both public and private options. Public healthcare is free for Colombian citizens and residents, and while it may not be as advanced as in some developed countries, it is still quite accessible. Private healthcare, on the other hand, is widely available and of high quality, especially in larger cities. This dual system ensures that digital nomads have multiple choices depending on their needs and budgets.

# Safety Concerns

Historically, Colombia has had safety issues, particularly in certain regions. However, major cities and popular tourist destinations are generally safe for visitors. It's important to stay informed about local conditions and avoid areas known for criminal activity. For example, Bogota has seen significant improvements in security over the years, with dedicated efforts to reduce crime rates. Medellin, once notorious for violence, has transformed into a thriving metropolis with robust safety measures.

* Bogota: Generally safe, but exercise caution
* Medellin: Highly improved, now considered very safe
* Cartagena: Tourist areas are safe, but petty crime exists

# Tips for a Smooth Transition: What to Expect Upon Arrival in Colombia

**Welcome to Colombia! Whether you're moving here for a digital nomad visa, a new job opportunity, or simply to explore the vibrant culture, there's plenty to look forward to. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to help you navigate your transition smoothly upon arrival.**

# Understanding the Immigration Process

**Upon arriving in Colombia, you'll need to complete several steps to ensure your stay is legal and hassle-free. The first step is registering with the¬†Direcci√≥n de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN), which is Colombia‚Äôs tax authority. You can do this online or at a local DIAN office. It‚Äôs essential to register within the first month of your arrival to avoid penalties.**

# Registering for a Foreigner ID Card (Tarjeta de Identidad Extranjera)

**To register, you‚Äôll need your passport, proof of address (such as a utility bill or lease agreement), and two recent photographs. Once registered, you‚Äôll receive a temporary ID card that allows you to work and access public services. This process usually takes a few weeks, so it‚Äôs advisable to start early.**

# Obtaining a Foreigner Registration Certificate (Registro Civil de Extranjer√≠a)

**The next step is obtaining a Foreigner Registration Certificate, which is issued by the Colombian National Police. This certificate confirms your registration and is necessary for opening bank accounts, getting a driver‚Äôs license, and more. You‚Äôll need your passport, temporary ID card, and proof of address to apply. Processing time varies, but it typically takes around one to two weeks.**

# Setting Up Your Living Arrangements

**Finding a place to live is a crucial part of settling in. Many newcomers opt for short-term rentals to get a feel for different neighborhoods before committing to a longer lease. Websites like¬†Olx.co¬†and¬†VivaReal.com¬†offer a wide range of listings. Make sure to inspect the property thoroughly and negotiate the terms with the landlord or agent.**

# Essential Utilities and Services

* **Internet:¬†Colombia has good internet infrastructure. Providers like Claro, Movistar, and DirecTV offer various plans. Consider your needs and budget when choosing a plan.**
* **Mobile Phone:¬†SIM cards are readily available at local stores. Popular providers include Claro, Tigo, and Movistar. Choose a plan that suits your calling and data requirements.**
* **Bills Payment:¬†Most bills can be paid online through banking apps or at designated payment centers. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and familiarize yourself with the process.**

# Securing Employment and Financial Matters

**If you‚Äôre planning to work in Colombia, having a valid work permit is essential. The type of visa you have will determine whether you need additional permits. For digital nomads, the¬†Digital Nomad Visa¬†offers flexibility and legality.**

# Opening a Bank Account

**To open a bank account, you‚Äôll need your Foreigner ID Card, Foreigner Registration Certificate, and proof of address. Banks like Davivienda, Bancolombia, and Banco de Bogot√° are popular choices. Visit a branch to complete the application process, which typically involves filling out forms and providing identification documents.**

# Getting Health Insurance

**Healthcare in Colombia is generally accessible and affordable. You can opt for private insurance or join the¬†Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud (SGSSS). Private insurers like Colsubsidio and Famisanar offer comprehensive coverage. Ensure you understand the terms and conditions of your chosen plan.**

# Exploring the Culture and Community

**Colombia is known for its warm and welcoming community. Joining local groups and clubs can help you integrate quickly. Platforms like** [**Meetup.com**](http://Meetup.com) **and Facebook groups dedicated to expats can be valuable resources.**

# Language and Communication

**While many Colombians speak English, especially in urban areas, learning Spanish can significantly enhance your experience. Consider taking classes at a local language school or using apps like Duolingo and Babbel.**

# Exploring Local Attractions

**From the bustling streets of Bogot√° to the beaches of Cartagena, Colombia offers a diverse array of attractions. Visit cultural landmarks, try local cuisine, and immerse yourself in the rich history and traditions.**

# Final Tips for a Smooth Transition

* **Stay Patient:¬†Adjusting to a new country takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow for a period of adjustment.**
* **Network:¬†Building connections can make a significant difference. Attend networking events, join professional groups, and connect with fellow expats.**
* **Stay Informed:¬†Keep up with local news and regulations. Follow reliable sources to stay informed about changes in immigration policies and other important updates.**
* **Enjoy the Journey:¬†Embrace the adventure. Colombia is full of surprises and opportunities. Enjoy every moment of your journey!**

I was previously using OBS v30.2.3 before updating, and I've been using the win-capture-audio plugin from Bozbez to capture individual game audio and never had a problem for the last 3 years or so.

After scrubbing through the VODs and testing out using recordings with multiple diffferent settings, all I've really found out is that using that audio capture method causes crackling roughly every 42 minutes, and lasts for about 2min10sec each instance.

1it88f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1it88f6/the_last_man_on_duty/,The last man on duty,"I take my job seriously. As a night shift security guard at a distribution centre, it‚Äôs my responsibility to keep everything in order. I do my rounds, check the locks, and make sure no one gets in‚Äîor out‚Äîwho shouldn't be here.

But lately, things have been going wrong.

The first theft happened three months ago‚Äîboxes of electronics vanished overnight. Then another, and another. Management was furious. The police came but left without answers.

And then, last night, it happened again.

I had just finished my second round when the call came in. Dispatch told me my backup‚ÄîMark‚Äîwas inside the building. That was odd. Mark wasn‚Äôt scheduled to be here.

I pulled up the live camera feeds. Sure enough, there he was, sneaking around the warehouse. He moved cautiously, ducking behind shelves, scanning the area. I switched angles, trying to see what he was after. Then I spotted the open crate beside him‚Äîour missing stock.

My stomach twisted. I finally had my guy.

I radioed dispatch, kept my flashlight off, and moved in quietly. When I turned the corner, he was bent over the crate, examining the stolen electronics.

‚ÄúMark.‚Äù

He froze. Turned. His face paled. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù

I hit the emergency button. The warehouse doors locked down. The alarms blared. Within minutes, police swarmed the building. Mark didn‚Äôt even try to run.

Mark was pale. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîno, I never‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt right!‚Äù

But the cops didn‚Äôt care. They even found a box of brand-new electronics inside his locker, the ones that were supposed to be distributed next week. The evidence was airtight. Too airtight.

""Now everything makes sense,"" said my manager. He would always complain about seeing a grainy shadow lurking around the warehouse in the security footages.

This time, Mark's entrance was recorded all over the system, and the footage sealed it.

They took him away in cuffs while he kept pleading, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like!‚Äù

I told them everything I knew. How Mark had been acting strange lately. How he entered the warehouse outside his shift. How I caught him red-handed.

By sunrise, management gave me a bonus. They called me a hero.

I went home, slept like a baby, and came back tonight for my shift.

I patrol as usual, but now, everything's different. The cameras. The alarms. The reports, they‚Äôre all working fine.

No more investigations.

Because Mark was getting too close. He was watching me. He was checking the security logs, realising that the stolen shipments were slowly disappearing between my shifts.

He came last night, probably looking for proof. But I was ten steps ahead.

That same day, I had tampered with the cameras and planted a box of brand-new electronics in his locker‚Äîone that had never even left the warehouse. Just enough to make him the prime suspect.

Poor Mark. He did it to himself.

I watch the monitors, sipping my coffee. The place is quiet.

My monitor flickered, my phone buzzed with static, and for a moment, my speakers emitted a faint, incoherent whisper. I thought it was a fluke until my old chat app‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt used in months‚Äîlit up with a notification.

**‚ÄúYou like horror? Listen to this.‚Äù**

There was a link attached. It led to a barebones webpage with a single audio file titled **‚ÄúThe Scariest Podcast Ever.‚Äù** No author. No description. Just a play button.

The comments were unsettlingly enthusiastic. Every review was five stars.

*‚ÄúYou just have to experience it!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúScariest thing I‚Äôve ever listened to!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNo spoilers, but if you stop listening before the end‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù*

I hesitated. This felt different. Not like a normal podcast, but something‚Ä¶ else. My heart was already beating faster, my instincts screaming at me to ignore it. But curiosity won.

I hit play.

The voice wasn‚Äôt human. Not robotic, not synthetic, but *wrong.* It vibrated, like multiple tones layered imperfectly. It began with a simple premise‚Äîan unnamed creature hunting its next victim.

Then it mentioned my school.

Not just my town. Not just some random high school. *My* high school.

‚ÄúThe creature lifts its head, catching a scent‚Ä¶ from a place where knowledge festers and youth stagnates.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. Then it got worse.

‚ÄúThe scent is strong, distinct. It will be easy to follow. From the Hollow Grounds Caf√© where the boy lingers, to the laughter of his friends echoing in the night.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. I had stopped at Hollow Grounds, the old coffee shop where people sometimes just‚Ä¶ disappeared. I had met up with my friends at the park, just like the podcast described.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was AI-generated based on local landmarks. But as the podcast continued, it mirrored my entire day with eerie precision.

‚ÄúThe boy doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs already been chosen. He walks home, the thing following, unseen. Watching.‚Äù

My hands were ice-cold. My room suddenly felt too quiet. I wanted to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn‚Äôt move. I needed to hear the end.

‚ÄúThe boy arrives at his house. He doesn‚Äôt check the locks.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThe creature waits. It doesn‚Äôt need to rush. It is patient. It is inevitable.‚Äù

I heard something creak downstairs.

I froze. Every hair on my body stood on end. It could have been the house settling. Or my dad getting water. But my parents' room was on the other side of the house.

The podcast went on.

‚ÄúThe creature enters. The scent is stronger here. It takes its time. It likes the chase.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My skin prickled as if something was standing just behind me.

‚ÄúIt moves upstairs. The steps creak beneath its weight.‚Äù

A step creaked outside my room.

I reached for my mouse, desperate to pause the audio, but I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to know what would happen if I stopped before it finished.

‚ÄúThe boy feels it now. The air shifts. The pressure in the room changes.‚Äù

The air in my room thickened, like it was alive.

‚ÄúIt stands behind him.‚Äù

A warmth, humid and rancid, ghosted against the back of my neck.

And then‚Äî

**The power went out.**

I was plunged into darkness. My monitor, my lamp, even my phone‚Äîdead.

And for a split second, in the reflection of my black screen, I saw something.

A figure. Naked. Pale. Its skin stretched tight over bones that were too big, too jagged. Its mouth was open wider than humanly possible, lined with needle-like teeth. Its eyes‚Äî

**Pitch black.**

And the air around it‚Ä¶ rippled. Like heat distortion. Like reality bending to accommodate something that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just my empty room. My door was still closed.

Then, just as suddenly as it had gone, the power flickered back on. My computer rebooted. My phone buzzed to life.

The chat window was gone. The message erased. The link‚Äîdeleted. I refreshed the page, searched for the podcast, scoured forums, archives, even the dark web. Nothing. It had vanished without a trace.

I‚Äôve been searching for it ever since. Years have passed, and I still check late at night, hoping for another anonymous message. Hoping to find that link again.

Not because I want to listen to it.

Because I need to know how it ends.

And because sometimes, when my room is dark and quiet, I still feel that breath on my neck.

And I wonder if it ever left at all.",1,1739979217.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1it86j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JaneAustenFF/comments/1it86j5/more_fanfic_issues/,More fanfic issues,"**Anachronism**

These don't throw me out of a story and many I don't worry about because the writers may well not have realized they need to look some things up, or they're so much a part of our lives today that you can't think it was different. And this is actually triggered by a fantasy novel set in the Regency by a well-known fantasy author, because most of their anachronisms are things I've seen in fanfic.

Examples: 

**Meals as eaten by the upper classes - breakfast at 10AM.** Formal meal eaten in the breakfast room. It was toast, cakes, maybe eggs, tea/coffee/chocolate, and it was served on the table, not the sideboard, and everyone sat down at the same time (as opposed to wandering in when they woke up.) It was normal to do things before breakfast - correspondence, errands, rambles around the neighboring estate, conferring with staff.  The breakfast in chafing dishes on the sideboard for whenever you wanted breakfast is Victorian.

**Dinner (main meal of the day, and not the same as supper)** \- Dinner was drifting later in the day, from about 2PM to about 6:30PM (that's when the oh so fashionable Netherfeld family ate) to eventually 8PM.  While *service a la Russe* (many small courses served in series) was starting, it didn't become fashionable even for the upper classes until Queen Victoria. What they had was *service a la francoise*. That is one or two courses plus dessert (not considered a course then) each with a main protein, with vegetables and fancier dishes AND sweets  distributed along the sides and corners of the table. You served yourself from the platters in front of you, while a servant passed the carved meat. 

If there were two course, the first would include soup, removed (replaced) by fish if it weren't Monday, plus a large joint or bird, roasted or boiled. The second would have game, lighter dishes and the trifles and sweet puddings. No one was expected to eat anything away from their immediate vicinity, although it was permitted to ask for a favorite dish placed out of reach. Dessert was fruit and nuts, served after the table was completely cleared of everything, including the cloth. If your fanfic has soup followed by fish followed by a main course of meat and a couple of sides followed by a sweet course, you're being Victorian. Dinner *al la francoise* was much simpler in terms of service - you only needed one place setting per course, instead of the Victorian array of stacked plates and flatware, and much fewer servants. At its height, *a la russe* required a footman per guest, whereas a la Francoise didn't need more than one or two because the guests served themselves.

**Supper, late in the evening.** With the main meal mid to late afternoon, it was natural to have a light bite - creamed chicken or shellfish, a vegetable or even just cold food - before bed. It was also common to invite people to ""drink tea"" after dinner (there would also be coffee and sherry - and women absolutely drank, so having them live on tea and lemonade is a bit much.) This was considered a very old fashioned thing by the Regency, what with dinner drifting later. The only people who we see having a supper were Mr. Woodhouse, who thought it very unhealthy BUT loved to see it served, and Aunt Phillips, who is just not a fashionable person. And again, while in 21st C US, dinner and supper are interchangeable, that was not true in Regency England.

You will note two meals missing - luncheon and afternoon tea. **Luncheon** was starting to exist, as dinner times drifted later and people needed a bite even after a late breakfast. It was usually cake or cold meat, and very informal - more like a snack. It could be a more formal affair, like Georgiana's ladies luncheon, but generally speaking, it was just something you grabbed.

**Afternoon tea did NOT exist at all.** There was no custom yet of sitting down to tea, scones and little sandwiches at 4PM. That would not happen until 1840, although it caught on very fast. Regency ended in 1820, when the Prince Regent became King George IV.  And by then, dinner for the upper classes was about  8PM. The lady who invented it, the Duchess of Bedford, literally got too hungry to wait. So afternoon tea is a total anachronism. It was also not the custom to serve visitors refreshments. This continued the entire century, which makes since formal calls were so short, and people tended to make many in one morning, which would be afternoon but before dinner.

Morning was defined as the time between waking and dinner, which makes sense to modern people since dinner was midday. When dinner started drifting later, so did mornings. Afternoon was the time between dinner and evening, which means it was getting really short to non-existent. When Mary says that she can have her mornings to herself, she means basically daylight hours.

**Tl/dr -** Upper class Regency meals and meal times were very different than either Victorian or modern day US. ",4,1739979098.0,JaneAustenFF,2,0.83,False

We've been dating for 2 years now and I was looking through his ig dms to send something to my friend (infront of him, wasn't snooping) and accidently clicked on this message thread from 2 years ago of him asking a girl he met at a bar to coffee (she declined as she had a bf). I almost didnt think anything of it cause it was old but after checking the date i realized it was 10 days after we had our exclusive bf/gf conversation (we had been going on dates for about 2 months at that point but hadn't become exclusive). I freaked out, he was super embarrassed and apologetic. i looked through his entire phone v thoroughly and couldn't find anything else. It's honestly been 2 years of bliss, i love him so much, were talking about engagement and moving in soon, hes introduced me to his family, friends, taken me ring shoppping... is this worth breaking up over? what do i do? he swears up and down he doesn't know why he did that, it was a mistake, hes would never cheat etc. I feel sad and violated, ad just wondering.. what would've happened if shed taken him up n the offer?

edit to clarify - we were exclusive when he asked her out. Ie we became exclusive dec 10th (after 2 months of dating), the text asking her out was from dec 20 (fake dates).",1,1739979091.0,AmIOverreacting,28,0.56,False

I don't know any one I can ask for help in my personal life, so I'm hoping some people here might be able to give me some insight and help. 

A few years ago my mother went through a really rough medical patch, she ended up in hospital for 17 days, and since then has only been on a downwards streak. 

It started with her quitting her job, which given her new found pain was understandable, her work was really stretching their paid medical leave for her, and it was nearing the end of how far they were able to stretch it, and she still wasn't doing any better, so decided to leave. It was a very difficult decision for her to make, and she felt awful about having to admit that she couldn't do all the things she used to be able too, but me and my father supported her through it and I think she was issued a therapist for a little bit to help her deal with her grieving. 

Then she stopped doing exercises that were recommended for her. It was recommended that she finds some way to stay physically active, even if the pain persists, because it wasn't good for her to lay on the couch all day, so she got an exercise bike. She used it for all but a few months before stopping, and it now sits in our hallway collecting dust and taking up space.

Id say throughout the past 8 months though she's really just, stopped trying. I think her complete lack of interest in trying to continue was losing our dog. Since he hospital visit a few years ago she has stopped going out, unless it is to take someone somewhere or pick something she's bought up. I have an active social and education life, and because my mum isn't working my dad has started working basically every day for 12hrs a day, so she was home alone a lot, and her only company was out dog. Unfortunately, our dog got cancer, and due to my parents hesitance to take her to the vet, by the time I convinced them, it was far too late for her, she she was put down. This really made my mum depressed, and I heard her say many times she was depressed, wanted to die etc, so against my family's better judgment we got a new dog a few months ago.

This perked my mum up for a little bit, and she used to even walk with our dog around our back garden and even tried to walk her on the street once, but over time she's stopped. Our dog is not trained, because my parents refuse to get a trainer, and due to this our dog seems to just stress her out (and has now become my sole responsibility but that's not important rn.) since the dogs become a burden to my mum spends a lot of days only in her bed, or she'll sit on the couch, yelling at the dog, ordering random things online we don't need so she can have a hit of dopamine. She's recently gotten a coffee maker and a bigish mini fridge in her room so she doesn't need to leave it if she's sore. 

She has completely given up on doing most anything, she won't drive, doesn't leave her bed often, doesn't want to get help. All she dose is sit, order things online, and rot in her room. 

I have been very empathetic for my mother, but it's been 3 or 4 years and she's only given up more, and more, and at this point my empathy is gone, and I hate myself for it. I don't want to resent my mother for her disability, but I can't help but get annoyed with how she's given up doing anything, she rarely even showers. I understand that she is most likely severely depressed, but she doesn't do anything towards seeking help either, in my country you can get therapy for free through medical service's, and she would qualify, but she refuses to even try. 

How do I continue to have empathy and patience for her? I've found myself becoming short, snappy, and uninterested when she talks to me, and I don't like that. She's lived all her life with people who are mean to her, I don't want to be one of them, but when I see her I can't help but think how upsetting it is that she's given up, and has no interest in trying to get better, and it makes me annoyed that she doesn't want to actively try to improve her situation, but seems to expects me and my father to continue to adjust ourselves to suit her new life, and she can be short with me if I don't encourage her, and instead talk against her (ex. When are orders things we don't need online, or when we got our new dog) 

I want to support my mother, I want to continue to be empathetic, sympathetic and patient, but I'm so exhausted, and I just need someone to give me and advice on what to do, on how to continue being empathetic, because I'm really struggling, and I don't know what to do anymore

1it8584,https://www.reddit.com/r/NissanRogue/comments/1it8584/my_experiences_with_a_2022_rogue_sv_awd_with_the/,My experiences with a 2022 Rogue SV AWD with the 3 cylinder VC Turbo engine.,"The following is a quick morning coffee rant, impromptu, unprepared, and not even proof read.

The Rogue has, hands down, the very fuel consumption numbers for a non-hybrid, af all cars on the road of that size and weight. That VC Turbo setup simply is a master piece of engineering. Drive this car feather light, and you get rewarded with numbers that make you feel that you were not needlessly pissing away precious gasoline. Long trips, 7l/100km no problemo. Even in winter, if you go easy, the winter penalty isn't terribly high. So yeah, Rogue FTW.  
But there also the matter of this magic engine setup being complex. There have been, unfortunately, a number of engine blow ups. It doesn't come without risks. Plus it suffers from a pretty bad lag. Sit in an intersection waiting to complete a left turn, and you need to dart out in a tight moment, and you'll know what I mean. That lag is real. But again, however, if you get used to it, go calm, just tune your foot/peddle into how the car responds best, and you'll live with it fine. What not to do with with this car is to floor it. This is a unique car where the highest torque sits in the middle RPM range. You want to find that sweet spot where most of the power is. Merging onto the highway, never floor it, because you'll accelerate a lot slower than it can. This car is an easy 8 second or even sub 8 second car - if - you work it properly. With practically every other car it's much simpler. Simply floor it and it'll deliver its highest performance. The Rogue is different. You basically have to massage the paddle and get it to wake up, and home in on where it works hardest. But how often is that needed anyway. It's not like we're racing constantly. And then cruising on the highway, with a nice low rpm for a 3 cylinder engine. Nice and quiet, you barely hear it.  
Sound insulation is good. Entertainment system is kind of awful, but hook up Android Auto or Apple Carplay and take it from there. The car beeps a lot. It complains no matter how you handle the doors. Use the trunk and it'll bitch about having been in the trunk. Have a passenger open the door to get it, and i'll have something more to bitch about. Beep! Beep beep! Beeeeeep! Drives me nuts. No car is perfect. So yeah, infotainment and warning handling isn't great at all. Radio sound quality is excellent.  
Cargo space is excellent, with its boxy rear shape. You can really play Tetris nicely when going on vacation, as you stuff so much in there.  
What else. Snow handling with its awd is simply stupid good. Throw winter tires on, and good ones, and this thing simply will not get stuck no matter what you do. You could literally go off road with this beast. There are comparison videos where it demonstrates how the car applies brake power on the 4 individual brakes in a way that prevents wheels spinning out of control. You could literally have traction in only one single wheel and you still get out! Is a Subaru even better at all? I don't know, what the Rogue is just about as capable as an awd gas car setup can possibly be. I've run this thing through unplowed roads where regular cars couldn't dream of even trying it, while the Rogue went ""hold my beer"".  
Moonroof. It's great for rear passengers, but honestly, as a driver, I'm not seeing any of it, because when I look forward I don't see what is up. Also, never opened it, because it gets windy. And I'm not driving up and down a beach boulevard or anything like that. It's cute to have, but I don't think I'll be spending money specifically for a moonroof next time. The kids like it in the back though, so there's that.  
Handling, the rumor was always that the CX-5 owns SUV handling, but I say the Rogue handles just about just as well. It's a confident secure solid drive along windy country roads, didn't have a problem with it at all.  
Seats are pretty decent, but it does get a little hard after a long time. I just move my butt around a bit and it's good. I like how it's not stretched fabric, and keeps looking decent after years of use.  
Would I buy this again? Here's the thing. I no longer have the car. I switch to a full electric car now. I miss the Rogue from time to time. I don't miss the lag, and now experience about a billion times more power, and I definitely don't miss any of the electronics. I no longer have a moonroof, but I never saw the darn thing while driving anyway. The Roque was better in deep snow, and I have a very long and sloped driveway and get a ton of snow. I got worried about the VC Turbo engine failure problem, but in hindsight, warranty would have covered like what 5 years / 100k km. And perhaps lawsuits will extend that warranty.  
This contributed to my decision, but also what drove it is that used electric car prices have tanked so much, and the Rogue's value held up somewhat, that the money I needed to make the trade wasn't all that much, and I couldn't resist, because I caught the electric bug. That's not for everyone, because charging on long trips can be a pita.  
Should you buy a Rogue? If electric really isn't a thing for you, I think you should weigh off a used RAV4 hybrid or PHEV, an Escape PHEV, or another used plug-in if there are options. If having a dual powertrain worries you and want to go full gas, what can you compare this to? CX-5, CR-V, RAV4, Taos, Outback, Forester, etc. CX-5 has unacceptable tight rear seating, and a narrow trunk. CR-V has theft problems. RAV4 feels plasticky and really stupid is the inside door handle is near the hinge make it frustrating to handle the door without crashing it into the car next to you. The other cars I'm not too familiar with. Mistake I always make is I don't spend enough time testing enough cars. How do you know you're not going to like the other cars better? Cars you fall in love with too quickly. You see something, you want it, and from that point it's all about confirmation bias until you buy it. You're selling yourself short if you fall into that love trap.",2,1739979009.0,NissanRogue,3,1.0,False

If you read all of it, thank you so much! I could really use someone to talk to right now as I'm sitting in the car crying at the gas station ü§¶


If I'm being completely and utterly honest, I do hate him.....

I hate everything he's ever done to me. I hate how I've been stuck and can't do a damn thing about it bc we have kids that I can't afford to take care of without him. I work 3rd so we don't have to pay childcare during the day bc he's home at night. 

He's been on my case lately and I asked him what was going on. He was doing that stupid calm cool and collected thing with a fucking narcissistic smile on his face shaking his head no and saying ""no it doesn't"" to everything I was saying. I'd had it. I hit a breaking point. I threw my store bought coffee at the wall and I loudly said ""I fucking hate you"" all the while he still had a smile on his face. It's not a proud moment for me. But honestly? I finally fucking reacted. Idgaf. I'm tired of being silent. It was either I say I hate you or I went at his face like a fucking cat with claws. So I did show some restraint.

Wanna know why I hate him? 

Let's break it down.......

He used to talk to a lot of girls when we first got married. Especially his ex. The girl talking finally stopped after like 7 years. üôÑ 

I went to Florida to surprise him while he was training down there. His new friend and my husband wanted to go to the bar and possibly strip club afterwards. Whatever. So I go. After 20 mins at the bar they're ready for the strip club. I don't wanna go yet, I barely had one drink. So they leave me there to catch a cab back to the hotel while they go. I cried the whole time I waited on that cab and at the hotel in fixing MIAMI üò≥. I get there and realize hes got the key, so now I'm sitting on the ground outside the room waiting. Luckily one of the guys in his class offered to take me across the street and get something to eat. I came back he still wasn't there. So I went to the guys room bc I was exhausted and went to sleep on the couch in his room. Hubby gets mad ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ ...   Looking back I know it probably wasn't smart to go in this guys room but we had hung out with him all week bc he had class with my husband, so I thought he was okand ended up being the perfect gentleman.  And the hotel didn't know I was there so I didn't wanna ask for a key. 

Once we got a hotel room for the night and I was super excited and bought an outfit and everything. My husband has a voyeur kink. That's cool, when it's consenting. He blindfolded me, which I was ok with. He has me wait in the bathroom bc he had a ""surprise"". Sat me in a chair and then Opened the hotel window and then invited some random man into our room. Told me to keep my hands down and everything. I didn't, bc I couldn't see so your first intinct is to put your hands out. My husband is a big guy And I touched a pair of thighs that were thin. I freaked the hell out and went to the bathroom. I left him that night. 

He's posted pics of me online before. Twice. Even after I told him no the first time. He also sent pics to his friends of me. 

He's fucking paranoid of everything. Thinking everyone is out to fuck him over, when he's the one that fucks other people over. 

He's always preaching trust to me, but he never does it. 

He's so damn black and white with everything and there's never a grey area. EVER. It's maddening. 


Complains I'm not the girl he once married. Ummm no shit dude, no one stays the same especially after the shit I've been through with you. Actions, meet your consequences. 

He's just not a good person. 

The jokes on me huh? 

This is just some of the fun things I've been through with him. Stupid me thought I could change him. But he won. He finally broke the fuck outta me. I'm nothing like I was when we got married. I'm a shell. Nothing but anxiety, hatred, resentment and cptsd. My mind is so fucked when it even comes to anything sex related. And I hate men bc of him. My hatred for men, is unreal. I don't wanna be like this. 

Lord forbid if something triggers me. I try to keep my triggers to myself but he senses I'm off and badgers me about it til I give in and tell him. He just says ""well, I've apologized what more do you want"". 

I'm 40. What the fuck do I do. I spent my fucking good years on this man. 

Thanks for letting me vent. I had to get it out...

1it83p0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1it83p0,started a fallout-inspired save last night where i only take screenshots from security camera angles,"I only just started playing after a long set up period so this is all I have, I'm not even a day in yet lol

I don't have any specific goals for each sim/generation other than to make babies for the next generation, so I guess you could say it's a control vault or a vault with a very tame experiment. I made the vault into a residential rental with each unit being an apartment while the rest of the vault is shared space.

I spent a lot of time building the underground part of a vault (found a good topside build on the gallery, will come back & edit this post later to credit the builder when i find it). The living spaces include: 2 singles apartments split by gender for young adults when they come of age, 2 married couples apartments (though I suspect I will need to build 1 more), 2 family apartments (also need to build 1 more), 3 elderly apartments, & the coveted Overseer's Quarters. The singles apartments only have a bookshelf, a radio, a couch, coffee table, sink, & 3 stools at counter spaces + 3 small bedrooms with a bed, nightstand, dresser, lamp, & desk + chair (might remove the lamp tbh). There is a shared shower/bathroom in a hallway near the living quarters that they use with 4 showers, sinks, & toilets. The married apartments have a bedroom with bed & dresser, a living room, a desktop with 2 journals for the married couple, a TV, a radio, & a personal bathroom with sink, mirror, toilet, & shower. Family apartments have a living area & 2 bedrooms, one for parents (bed, dresser, infant bed) & one for children (child bed, toddler bed, & diaper changing station) They also have personal kitchens (stove, sink, fridge, trashcan, family dinner table, high chair) & bathrooms (shower/tub, double sink, toilet). The elderly have only a bed, a couch, a chair, & a dresser & are on the very bottom floor of the vault, near the reactor. They also have to use the shared bathroom that's all the way on another floor (my goal honestly is to see if the extra exertion will eventually kill them faster so i don't run out of room in the vault).

Shared areas include a cafeteria, a library, a gym, a recreation area with a card table/books/darts a children's playroom, a garden/simulated outside area, a classroom, a security office + jail cells (in case someone gets too rowdy), a clinic, & a room for funerals where I also plan on storing urns.

I made all my sims very personal & gave them all distinct personalities & likes/dislikes so that the relationships between them would progress naturally. I made 4 female & 4 male sims & set them all to be exploring their sexualities so that could develop later on (might download adeepindigo's LGBT mod tho just to try for this). I also plan on downloading an arranged marriage mod so that I can marry sims together regardless of attraction since the vault's experiment is technically continued procreation.

My gen 1 female sims are Dorothy, Jeanette, Claire, & Etta. My males are Irving, Matthew, James, & Lance. I used a spinning wheel generator to pick the Overseer, who ended up being Dorothy (she's the one doing yoga by herself in the screenshots if you're curious). Then, I used a random team generator to pair them all off as follows: Dorothy/Irving, Matthew/Jeanette, Claire/James, & Lance/Etta. After I play them for a week, they will have a group marriage ceremony (I gave all the women dresses in formal wear similar to the one Lucy wears in the TV show since the idea of a single dress being passed down through the generations is one of my fav pieces of vault culture lore. The men all have a button up/suspenders combo in muted Vault-Tec colors).

So far my rules are heavily based on the concept of the nuclear family since Vault-Tec pushes that kind of rhetoric in the games:

1. No money cheats except to move.
2. No going to the surface until at Least gen 10 (some rabbit holes are exceptions just because some are unavoidable, but no traveling to new lots).
3. Cannot replace items, only repair.
4. Once a sim ages into a young adult, they get moved into the singles apartments of their respective gender.
5. Once all sims in a generation have been young adults for at least one week (meaning the last sim born in a gen has to be young adult for 1 in game week even if others age up before it) before being paired off using a random generator.
6. If the pregnancies in a gen start leaning towards one gender & thus would make uneven pairings in the future, sims are allowed to terminate said pregnancy until they get the gender they need to balance the gen out (this isn't very nuclear family, but kind of necessary to keep the vault going).
7. All young adult sims must get randomly assigned any career that can be done from home.
8. Pregnant sims cannot work/do physical labor & must quit their job upon becoming pregnant.
9. If the gene pool is running low on diverse genetic material, you are allowed to move in new dwellers from ""another vault"" (make them in CAS, actually have a secondary vault, etc, just no random townies that the game actually spawns‚Äîthese can be used as wastelanders once you get to gen 10 & can leave/open the vault).
10. No divorces allowed.

I plan on playing more as soon as I get home from work, so I might post more screenshots later. I' so excited to dive into this save üëÄ",28,1739978899.0,LowSodiumSimmers,1,1.0,False

I have a problem with my sage/breville barista express. I have it for about 3 years and it should be the 9 bar model. And now to the problem. When I make an espresso, usually 18g in, 36g out in around 30 seconds, the presure gauge needle show high pressure, above the espresso range, marked in red in the picture. What I have read, that is 14-16 bar. 9 bar is around the marked green. When i set the grind, so that it shows around 9 bars, the coffee flows very quickly. What could be the problem? I clean and descaled it every month.

Thanks for the advice

After payment made, I looked at the estimate pickup time. 3:10pm!

Eventually I get to pick up earlier at around 2:40pm. 

I find the app ordering experience quite decent (despite the long wait, which is understandable on the opening day), cuz the estimated pickup time was updated from time to time. when it was ready, a QR will be shown and you can get it scanned at the scanner placed at the pickup counter.

Taste wise, I find it ok (not really a coffee person here, am an ""eat-to-live"" person), as long as it doesn't hurt my wallet a lot, and it satisfies my taste buds.

With the U.S. being so unpredictable, now is the time to have a 72-hour emergency kit ready. These kits are always a smart move, but with tensions escalating, preparedness is more important than ever.

As someone with a background in military and law enforcement, I know that staying ahead of a crisis is key. Having food, water, medical supplies, and key essentials ready to go means you won‚Äôt be scrambling if things take a turn.

No fear‚Äîjust smart planning. If there was ever a time to get prepared, it‚Äôs now. It‚Äôs also important you create an emergency plan ahead of time with your family, you want to avoid panic and know that if  the worst case scenario happens you‚Äôll be prepared for the initial days. 


Here is a basic 72 hour emergency kit:

1. Water & Hydration

‚Ä¢	6L+ of water per person (2L per day minimum)

‚Ä¢	Water purification tablets (Aquamira or Potable Aqua)

‚Ä¢	Collapsible water bottle (HydraPak Seeker)


2. Food & Energy

‚Ä¢	High-calorie emergency rations (Datrex or SOS bars)

‚Ä¢	Protein bars, nuts, jerky, or peanut butter

‚Ä¢	Freeze-dried meals (Mountain House, ReadyWise) + small stove & fuel

‚Ä¢	Instant coffee, tea, or electrolyte packets


3. Shelter & Warmth

‚Ä¢	Compact sleeping bag (Snugpak Softie Elite 3 or similar)

‚Ä¢	Mylar emergency blanket (SOL Heat Reflective Blanket)

‚Ä¢	Lightweight tarp (10x10 Silnylon) + paracord for shelter

‚Ä¢	Cold-weather gloves, hat, extra socks


4. Light & Power

‚Ä¢	Headlamp (Black Diamond or Petzl) + extra batteries

‚Ä¢	Tactical flashlight (Fenix PD36R, Streamlight)

‚Ä¢	Power bank (Anker 20,000mAh) to charge devices

‚Ä¢	Solar charger (Goal Zero Nomad 10)


5. Communication & Information

‚Ä¢	Portable radio (Baofeng UV-5R or Midland emergency radio)

‚Ä¢	Backup phone charger

‚Ä¢	Preloaded USB with emergency contacts, ID copies, and maps

‚Ä¢	Local maps + compass (Silva Ranger)


6. First Aid & Medications

‚Ä¢	Basic first aid kit (bandages, antiseptic, painkillers)

‚Ä¢	Trauma kit: tourniquet (CAT Gen 7), QuikClot gauze, Israeli bandage

‚Ä¢	Prescription meds (3+ day supply)

‚Ä¢	Antihistamines, Imodium, electrolyte tabs


7. Self-Defense & Security

‚Ä¢	Bear spray (Sabre Frontiersman ‚Äì legal & effective)

‚Ä¢	Tactical pen or Kubotan (legal impact tool)

‚Ä¢	Multitool (Leatherman Wave+, Gerber Center-Drive)

‚Ä¢	Fixed blade survival knife (Morakniv Garberg, ESEE 5)


8. Documents & Cash

‚Ä¢	Passport, ID, emergency contacts (sealed in a waterproof pouch)

‚Ä¢	$200-500 in small bills (USD & CAD)

‚Ä¢	Prepaid credit card or emergency bank access plan


9. Clothing & Protection

‚Ä¢	Weather-appropriate extra clothes

‚Ä¢	Rain poncho or lightweight waterproof jacket

‚Ä¢	Dust mask (N95 or P100) for smoke/airborne hazards

‚Ä¢	Work gloves (Mechanix or Hestra)




Basic emergency plan: 

1. Emergency Contacts & Communication Plan

‚Ä¢	Primary & Backup Contacts: Local & out-of-province contacts in case local networks fail.

‚Ä¢	Meeting Point: A designated safe location if separated (one nearby, one further away).

‚Ä¢	Communication Plan: If cell networks fail, use radio (FRS, GMRS, HAM), landlines, or pre-written notes.


2. Evacuation & Bug-Out Routes

‚Ä¢	Primary Route: Fastest way to a safe location (e.g., out of the city or border points).

‚Ä¢	Backup Routes: If main roads are blocked, have at least two alternative routes.

‚Ä¢	Transportation Plan: Pre-arrange vehicles, fuel, or rendezvous points if leaving separately.


3. Shelter-in-Place Plan (If Staying Home)

‚Ä¢	Safe Room: A secure area for sheltering from civil unrest, riots, or chemical exposure.
	
‚Ä¢	Supplies Location: Water, food, medical kit, power backup, and defense tools.
	
‚Ä¢	Defence Plan: If threats arise, know who is responsible for securing doors, exits, and alerting authorities.


4. Financial & Legal Readiness
	
‚Ä¢	Emergency Cash: CAD & USD in small bills in case ATMs go offline.
	
‚Ä¢	Essential Documents: Passports, IDs, insurance papers, property deeds, birth certificates (keep copies in a waterproof/fireproof pouch).
	
‚Ä¢	Backup Banking Access: Prepaid debit cards or online banking redundancy if systems fail.


5. Family Roles & Responsibilities
	
‚Ä¢	Who Carries What? Assign who manages first aid, supplies, navigation, and defense.
	
‚Ä¢	Emergency Drills: Practice what to do if evacuation is needed or if family members are in different locations.
	
‚Ä¢	Child & Pet Care Plan: Ensure kids know emergency contact info and have a go-bag; make sure pets have supplies.


6. Information & Intelligence
	
‚Ä¢	Trusted News Sources: Follow official updates, but verify information to avoid misinformation.
	
‚Ä¢	Code Words: Have a family-specific code phrase to signal an emergency or indicate safe arrival.
	
‚Ä¢	Threat Monitoring: Track border security, civil unrest, supply chain issues, and government actions.



There‚Äôs no need to be afraid‚Äîpreparedness isn‚Äôt about fear, it‚Äôs about resilience. Knowing you have a plan, the right supplies, and the skills to handle uncertainty should bring confidence, not anxiety. No matter what happens, staying informed, self-sufficient, and connected to those around you will always be the best approach.

So, we've been speaking about movies and past relationships and such. Just ""friendly"" chat at least at first. I invited her to have a coffee and she said that she'd love to, but that she wasn't available for like a month. So I took it as a negative response, and continued talking but without much expectations from that part until like 3 days ago.

Last weekend I was at a party and drank a lot. We were talking via whatsapp, and she told me that she was drunk too because was playing a game with friends and I don't remember what else. So I said to her that since we were both so wasted, I could tell her that I think that she's a really nice person and that I want to know her better. She answered saying that she feels the same about me, and that she likes talking with me.

After an hour or so, she also asked me if I liked ""her story"" (she posted a story about her outfit), and there I didn't answered because I was with friends and didn't noticed she had written me. So she said something like \*Oh, is my story so out of place? :(\* and changed topics.

I didn't answered that message next day because I felt like it would feel too out of place, because she started speaking about other stuff and such. But since then, she uploaded 2 different stories that I suppose were for me:

\-One was a meme basically saying ""When I can watch X movie with him"" and a bunch of hearts, and I had previously said that the movie she was referring to, is my favorite movie.

\-One of her from the previous night, showing her outfit (the same that she asked me about) and saying something like ""Is my outfit seriously that ugly? :(""

So, when I saw this last story, I answered saying ""It already looked pretty on you in your previous photo. You're beautiful""

She answered saying ""Thanks"", a heart emoji, and deleted that story immediately. After that, we continued talking about a movie that she was watching and I've already seen, and out of nowhere she told me ""Look, I don't want to talk right now. Sorry, I'll talk to you later. I'm seriously not feeling okay"". I told her that it's okay and she can talk with me about whatever she's facing if she wants. She left me on read and haven't spoken to me since.

Was my comment out of place? Like... I don't know, it wasn't the first time that I said to her that I think she's really pretty (in fact, my first message to her was saying that she's cute lmao).

1. Joburg or Cape Town? I understand this may depend but I am looking more for a quiet life where I can walk frequently and have easy access to food/gym/coffee. I lived in Tokyo for a long time and don't mind the city life but am from rural/farmland America and think I prefer something between the two.

2. Medical insurance while in SA. Where do you go to look for this? I have no real medical issues but want to research and factor that into my budget, so far all I can find is short term international insurance for people staying very short periods of less than 3 months.

3. Is a car necessary for daily life of someone not working if I specifically choose a place to live that is walkable to food/gym? Both in Joburg and Capetown.

4. General opinion from locals, do I spend my retirement in America or is South Africa worth the leap? I've had some weird itch in the back of my head to visit South Africa for the better part of 10 years but have never made the leap to do so. I know there's a lot going on in the world at the moment and given my unique financial situation I am fairly exempt from any economic problems that could arise, but you never know.",1,1739977828.0,askSouthAfrica,1,1.0,False

1it7n2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1it7n2i/hmm_baffled_that_this_aint_working_for_me/,"Hmm, baffled that this ain't working for me","Hi all,

I'm a month into Keto to get rid of weight I gained on medication.

I suspect I was getting hidden carbs in the first couple of weeks but am now on a 17 day streak on Carb Manager for less than 20g carbs a day.

Currently 85KG, and calculated BMR is just over 1700 calories. Fairly sedentary but play sport for 2-4 hours a week. My normal weight is around 76KG. 

According to Carb Manager last week's average was

1580 calories

14g net carbs

130g fat

85g protein

I guess I'm burning fat now as I haven't had any carbs in weeks, but I haven't lost any water weight so unsure. Most of my carbs are from Avacado and dairy cream in my coffee.

Any advice? Wondering if I should go lower on the calories - I've dropped consumption to 1350 for the last few days. Could be that my low dose of zyprexa is interfering. Going to stick with it for a few weeks and see if there's any improvement. Just a bit confused that no water weight has been lost.

On the plus side I'm a sugar addict and haven't had any in a month!

1it7mnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1it7mnl/joe_k_part_2/,Joe K - Part 2,"K was booked in at 9.24am and taken to a holding cell. The Saturday sun shone through the one small window, casting the shadows of its bars over the bars depicted on a poster informing him that *Crime Doesn't Pay*. Behind them, a remorseful face, so stereotypical it looked more like an advert for eugenics, stared out, urging him not to make the same mistakes - I fought the law, and the law won, it said. On the desk below it, was a single sheet of paper and a pencil. At the top of the paper was the heading *Initial Plea*, and under that the word *Name...*, and under that the word *Statement...*, with the rest of the page left blank. ""Am I supposed to fill this in?"" he whispered to himself. Maybe he should wait until he knew exactly what it was he was accused of. Maybe these were just left in all the cells for general use and it didn't really apply to him... Maybe he should fill his name in just in case. He sat down on the wooden chair, carefully printed his name in the space provided, and stared at it until his fists clenched and his whole body tensed up. With pent-up aggression and seething determination he flipped the pencil over and forcefully abused the eraser, repeating - ""No!... No!... No!..."" He refused to give the impression that there was even the slightest hint of acceptability or validity in the whole preposterous, contemptible, procedure he was being forced to endure through absolutely no fault of his own. His caged animal instincts were urging him to shout, scream, punch the wall, and throw the chair against the door, but he didn't want to give them the satisfaction of behaving in such a violent, self-destructive way. He had to maintain the moral high ground. He had to maintain his composure and his sanity.

A few minutes later, he started to feel dizzy and decided to lay down on the bed and try to relax. ""It doesn't look too comfortable,"" he said. ""And what the fuck is that stain?"" When he eventually did lay down on the bed, he made the uncomfortable discovery that it was more comfortable than it looked, and wondered how long they were planning on keeping him locked up in here for, anyway... and what was that camera for? This wasn't fair. This shouldn't be happening to him. He'd never done anything wrong... Well, he'd never done anything illegal, anyway... Well, he'd never done anything wrong *and* illegal... As far as he knew.

With all the time he spent alone in his flat, it might seem strange that he could feel so nauseous after so short a time in this place. After all, he'd slept in smaller rooms than this before. Of course, the bars on the window, the locked, heavy, metal door and the thick, stone, cold walls made all the difference. The key word here was *confinement*. Staring at the ceiling, he could see those walls closing in on him out the corners of his eyes. When he looked directly at them, the ceiling started moving down towards him. He'd suffered from claustrophobia since his brother had locked him in an old trunk at their grandparent's house when they were children. Their grandfather was bed-bound and terminally ill at the time, dying later that day, and the two events formed an association in K's mind that would lead to a lifelong fear of being buried alive, or taphophobia. He closed his eyes and used the tool he always did for dealing with situations like this - his brain.

His brain gave him a distinct advantage over less intellectual, more emotionally intelligent, prisoners like vulnerable people in mental institutions or marine mammals in not-much-amusement parks - they can't logically process the suffering they're forced to endure. Capable of higher reasoning, he was able to let one part of his brain tell a different part of his brain that what it was experiencing was nothing more than a stress-induced hallucination. While rational thought had the chair, it also took the time to remind another part of his brain that he was living in a liberal democracy - sooner or later, they would realise their mistake and let him go. He may even get some compensation for the distress they've caused. In any event, this was certain to end up as a mildly interesting anecdote that few would ever hear and even less would care about. To distance himself from the reality of his physical confinement, he allowed his mind to drift above his corporeal shell and float in the psychological freedom no prison walls could take away. ""You just lay there,"" he told his body. ""I'll come and get you when it's time to go. I know that you are safe now, and freedom can wait. I know that I am free now, and safety can wait. I know that... dualism is the refuge of the idealist - shit!"" He cursed his knowledge for spoiling his reasoning, and found himself back inside the shell inside the cell. At least the walls had stopped moving.

Switching tactics, he counted the tiles on the ceiling. He did it left to right, going down, then down and up, going right, then right to left, going down, then up and down, going right, then left to right, going up, then down and up, going left, then right to left, going up, then up and down, going left. Then he started in one corner and traced the outline of an imaginary ball bouncing off the walls until a fly landed on his face and he lost his place. He watched the fly for while, trying to predict its behaviour. It proved impossible. He wondered if human beings were more or less predictable than flies. He tried to remember the opening lines of some of his favourite novels. ""I am nothing but a corpse now, a body at the bottom of a well."" ""A screaming comes across the sky, it has happened before but there is nothing to compare it to now."" ""Suicide calculated well in advance, I thought, no spontaneous act of desperation."" Was it - ""The first time Yossarian *saw* the chaplain he fell madly in love with him,"" or, was it - ""The first time Yossarian *met* the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.""? ""Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing..."" What? A toothbrush? A knife? His conscience? This was harder than he'd thought it would be. He had more success with Bob Dylan song lyrics, got a lot of *Bringing It All Back Home*, most of *Highway 61 Revisited*, and was struggling to remember the fifth line of the fourth verse of ""Visions of Johanna"" when the door opened and a policewoman instructed him to get to his feet and follow her. Finally, he thought, they've realised their mistake, I'm going home... but not before I have it out with whoever's in charge around here. He thought wrong.

K was lead to a dark, windowless interview room with a table, two occupied chairs and a vacant one. The vacant chair was next to a fat man in a pinstripe suit with a large, balding head and thin wire-framed glasses. Opposite him, a tall, broad-shouldered policemen with brown hair and a matching thick moustache straddling a big, self-satisfied grin, rose and offered K his hand.

""Do take a seat, Mr K, I'm Chief Inspector Dee,"" he said, in an authoritative Oxbridge voice that completed the impression of Stephen Fry in *Blackadder Goes Forth*. ""You know Mr. Ohm, of course?""

""No,"" said K, sitting down and suspiciously examining the plastic cup of coffee in front of him - should he risk it? ""I don't believe we've had the pleasure.""

""Are you sure? He *is* your lawyer, after all. Foster, you remember Mr K, don't you?""

""Well he is in our records, I'm sure of it."" Ohm said in a mid-west Amerikan accent, looking K up and own, lifting his glasses, as if that would improve his eyesight, and putting them back on his nose again. ""But, I must admit, the face doesn't ring a bell.""

""Well, it is a forgettable face,"" suggested Chief Inspector Dee. ""There's not a lot going on there that one can really latch on to, so to speak.""

""Yeah, that must explain it."" Ohm considered the matter settled.

""That doesn't explain anything,"" said K, wondering if he really did have such a forgettable face. ""What explains it is that we've never met each other before. Furthermore, I don't have, and never have had a lawyer so, with all due respect, Mr Ohm, there's no way I could be in your records."" The chief inspector visibly stiffened and shot a glance at the lawyer with enough force to put him straight in his seat, as if Dee was his stoic stepfather and he was a small boy picking up the wrong fork.

""What are you playing at, Foster? This is not the sort of professionalism I've come to expect from your office. You really must update your records. As for you, Mr K, how do you intend to defend yourself without a lawyer?""

""Well that's just it, I intend to defend myself.""

""Defend yourself? It appears that the initial investigation was spot on - you've been reading too many books, Mr K, that sort of thing doesn't happen in the real world. Why, not even Foster here would defend himself, would you, Foster?""

""God, no, I would be completely unqualified.""

""But surely a man has every right to defend himself against his accuser? That's only fair, isn't it?"" Although K had addressed this question to him, the chief inspector clearly had no intention of engaging in what he, no doubt, considered to be a frivolous legal debate, beneath both his standing and his pay grade.

""Your need, or not, of legal representation is something you'll have to discus with your legal representative, Mr K.""

""And what if I don't have a legal representative?""

""Well, if you agree to employ the services of Mr Ohm, I'm sure he'll be willing to explain to you why you had to employ his services - is that alright with you, Foster?""

""I'm more than happy to comply with all my client's requests... as long as they are within the bounds of the law, of course."" With the towering presence of the chief inspector looming over them both, the lawyer took K's meek, reluctant gesture as confirmation that he'd just been hired and continued. ""The problem is that what seems fair, morally speaking, isn't always the same thing as what is fair, legally speaking. A man's accuser will have the advantage of legal representation so he will be putting himself at a disadvantage if he chooses to refuse the same advantage, and that wouldn't be fair. So while it's only fair that a man should be allowed to defend himself, in the interest of fairness, the law cannot allow him to do so.""

""Because the law is fair,"" said Chief Inspector Dee. ""...Isn't it, Foster?""

""...Damn right it is,"" said Ohm, eventually.

""That's settled then, so how about we let this conversation evolve some opposable thumbs before it goes extinct? May I see your *Initial Plea* form, Mr K?""

""My initial... um... the thing is... given that I... um..."" K had lost whatever composure and dignity he'd managed to convey so far and struggled to find the right words. He found himself staring at his coffee and wishing he could go back in time and fill in that form. The written word had always been his preferred method of communication, the only way he'd ever felt capable of expressing himself, and that rash decision had left him at a severe disadvantage. Also, why did he say he was going to defend himself when there was nothing for him to defend? He became acutely aware of how guilty and incompetent he must appear, making any attempt at coherence next to impossible. Yet he was unable to stop his jumbled words escaping. ""...some mistake... I don't know... that is, I haven't... um...""

""The form, Mr K?""

""I didn't complete the form.""

""You didn't complete the *Initial Plea* form?""

""Well, I filled in my name, but... I erased it.""

""You erased it? Why did you do that? Did you forget who you are? You *are* Joe K, the bank clerk, aren't you?""

""Yes, sir... I mean, yes, Chief Inspector.""

""May I have a word with my client?""

""Please do.""

""You're not Joe K, the bank clerk, you're Joe K, the cleaner.""

""I'm Joe K, the cleaner."" He looked at Chief Inspector Dee. ""I'm Joe K, the cleaner.""

""Well, at least we've cleared that up. Now are you beginning to see why you need a lawyer, Mr K? As for the *Initial Plea* form, we can make an exception for someone with... *special* circumstances, we are a very progressive institution these days, as our press statements prove. If you would like to request *special* assistance we are only too happy to accommodate you. We have a very good... *special assister* on call. She's not based in Glowbridge but your welcome to wait in one of our holding cells. It should only be a couple of hours, maybe three, depending on the traffic.""

""No!... I mean, I don't have... I mean, that's very good of you, but... ... ""

""Go ahead, Mr K and, rest assured, whatever you say in here will be held in the strictest confidence."" K looked at the voice recorder on the table and the camera in the corner.

""I don't know... I don't know...""

""What don't you know?"" the chief inspector loudly and impatiently interjected, slamming the palm of his hand on the table and frightening Ohm, who may have been falling asleep, more than it did his newest client. The immediate effect on K was to focus his mind on the main point it had been fumbling around for in all its nervous confusion. Simultaneously, his long-term memory dumped something else into his mind, something from George Orwell he chose to take more literally out of its original context, if only to deliver a much needed boost to his already low and rapidly deteriorating confidence - *Ignorance is strength*.

""I don't know what it is I'm accused of,"" he calmly declared, as if that would clear everything up and put the interview exactly where it needed to be. Unfortunately, he was the only one who saw it that way.

""You don't know what it is you're accused of?"" was Chief Inspector Dee's incredulous response. ""You don't know? Have you ever heard of such a thing, Foster? You've got your work cut out with this one, old chap, it'll be a miracle if you win this case.""

""But I'm innocent,"" said K.

""Finally, we get a plea. Thank you, Mr K, that's so good of you, and on behalf of the police force let me extend to you our eternal gratitude. There is just one thing to clear up though, if you don't mind. How the fuck can you say you're innocent when you don't know what it is you're accused of, you imbecile?""

""Can he really speak to me like that?"" K asked his lawyer.

""Oh, it's completely unacceptable and, as your legal representative..."" Ohm began coughing and reached into his breast pocket for a handkerchief. ""Excuse me... as your legal representative I strongly..."" He resumed coughing into his handkerchief, this time for a good twenty seconds. ""As your legal representative, I strongly advise you not to let it happen again. It's not good for your case at all. I suggest you take some time to think about your behaviour."" He finished his coughing fit, wiped his mouth and quickly put his handkerchief away while the chief inspector stared down at K like a frustrated piano teacher would a ham-fisted student. It was a look that said - ""I'm not angry at you, I'm just disappointed in you.""

For a long minute, the only sound in the room was the insistent buzzing of the electric light above their heads. It was unbearable. He had to give in and sip his weak, oily coffee - worse than he'd suspected, like aniseed and rotten eggs - just to calm his nerves. Then, after K had been subjected to this intimidating demonstration of power long enough to satisfy the chief inspector's perverse will, he leaned forward, put his elbows on the table, his fingers together and flashed a big, friendly, moustache-crowned smile.

""Now that you've calmed down a bit, may we continue?... Mr K?... may I call you Joe?... thank you."" With a soundtrack of overdramatic exclamations, he consulted his notes for a further half a minute before continuing. ""You live alone, Joe, is that correct?""

""Yes.""

""How old are you, Joe?""

""Fifty.""

""Are you married? or have you ever been married?""

""No.""

""Any children, living or deceased?""

""None.""

""Can you explain?""

""Explain what?""

""Explain how it's possible for a man to live for half a century without getting married, or at least co-habiting, and having children.""

""As far as I'm aware, it's not illegal to be single and childless and, if you're trying to imply something about my lifestyle, your interpretation of the law is as antiquated as your attitude and your instincts are entirely misguided.""

""Joe, please, I'm not implying anything, I'm merely trying to build a profile. If you're not a homosexual and you're not a monk and there's no record of you ever seeking any medical help for any... particular dysfunction, then why have you never got married or had any children? It's a very simple question.""

""And it's a very simple answer - it's just not something I've ever chosen to do.""

""I'm sorry, Joe, but what sort of an answer is that? It's not something *anyone* ever chooses to do. Sure, we choose *who* we have a relationship with and *who* we have children with, but humans are a coupling, procreating species by default. It's what we're naturally predisposed to do, and you've taken a conscious decision to defy that. You've told Mother Nature to fuck off, Joe, and I want to know why.""

""Well, that's one way of looking at things, I guess, but, given the current state of the planet and the obvious contribution humans have made, and continue to make, to that, and the ongoing population explosion and habitual expansion of our ecologically destructive species, you could argue that I'm one of the few people who are *not* telling 'Mother Nature to fuck off.'"" Having felt he'd made his point, K finally found enough self-confidence to meet the chief inspector's gaze for more than a second, but Dee refused to be the first of them to back down and patiently stared back with the curious detachment of a biologist, until he'd successfully established whose eye was on the microscope and whose face was on the slide. Once the natural order was resumed, he continued to examine his specimen for several seconds before writing something in his notes.

""Are you a misanthropist, Joe?""

""No.""

""Yet you live alone, you work alone, you have no family and no friends.""

""I have friends - not many, but as many as I need.""

""Need for what?""

""For...""

""Say 'no comment',"" said Ohm. K gave him a quizzical look. ""As your lawyer, I advise you to say 'no comment'.""

""Why?"" said K. Ohm leaned towards his ear.

""Trust me, I know how this tricky son-of-bitch's mind works, it's better to say nothing now than to get caught in a lie later.""

""But I've no reason to lie, I'm innocent.""

""I think it's best we don't mention that again, you know what happened last time.""

""No comment?"" K cautiously suggested to the chief inspector and immediately found himself feeling guilty.

""During the search of your flat, we found no mobile phone, no computer and no internet access. Furthermore, and despite the efforts of our top boffins, we were unable to find any online presence of you what-so-ever. Not one account, profile, video, photo, comment - not even a solitary email. You're a nonentity in virtual reality and a virtual nonentity in reality. I'm having a hard time believing you even exist. Who are you, Joe?""

""I'm just a cleaner.""

""A cleaner, yes, a cleaner... who reads."" Dee consulted his notes again. ""Two thousand, four hundred and eighty books were found in your flat - that's a lot of books.""

""I like to read.""

""Evidently, but what else do you like to do?""

""Say 'no comment'.""

""No comment.""

""What do you believe in?""

""Say 'no comment'.""

""No comment.""

""Are you a nihilist, Joe?""

That's why I prefer having one window per workspace and waving left and right while drinking coffee. But it's quite tiring to swipe when there are more than four workspaces, so I group windows and switch between them with one of these methods:

1. Super/Alt+Tab
2. Swiping up and picking window with a cursor
3. Striking in the corner then picking

Imo, the only good method is the first one, and it is still not universal because you're not always in a typing position. So, why not switch windows with a gesture? It can be four-finger horizontal swipe that launches carousel or whatever suits Gnome the best (tons of switchers on Plasma can suggest some ideas).

""Actually I'm a pretty emotional guy.""

For the most part, I protect myself by being detached. My only goal in Odessa, TX is to ride this job as long as it ""works for me.""

I've heard it said that it's not how much money you make, but how much you save.

Out of anyone working in this oil rich community I have to be the lowest paid dude here. No shit.

The Jesus House serves breakfast and lunch Monday - Thursday and they changed my days off to Tuesday and Wednesday.

That's perfect.

""We get along fine. I like you.""

That's the truth. I have compassion for this lady. A three time loser in a system designed to keep you a slave.

She's working full time. Has to have a roommate. She's a grandmother.

We've had more than one dust up. She can push my buttons.

I knew from the beginning that this could be a catalyst for me to leave Odessa.

Not how she treats me. How I respond.

So I do my best to set boundaries and keep calm. I can hear the tension in my voice.

""Don't yell at me.""

""You've been yelling at me since I got here.""

""I talk loud.""

""So do I.""

I was about two or three more of these dust ups from packing my gear and leaving.

Not how she's treating me. How I'm treating her.

I'm basically making minimum wage, living at the shelter (detached like a motherfucker) and eating at the bum feed to get my nutrients. Supplementing that with dumpster diver, dollar tree dinners and two for one at McDonald's for breakfast when the Jesus House ain't feeding.

....

My last day at work me and this lady were getting along. Who knows how long it lasts. People who are institutionalized are experts at manipulation in ways you haven't seen.

I've went on tilt before. I won't do that to a woman and wont do that at work.

There is only one thing that changed. That I'm aware of.

She - like those people at the shelter had been freezing me out. Hostile in her silence and passive aggressive treatment.

Detached.

I came in on Monday and she was all smiles and laughing and joking with me. At work, I'm not holding a grudge. But I'm also not your Toby.

I almost never argue with a woman that I'm not emotionally invested in. I have with her. Twice. I was ready to hit the road. Fr.

...

On Sundays there is a big, strong, younger dude I work with. People in the break room constantly tell him to be quiet. The same people who are playing videos and being loud themselves.

I'll troll everyone in there and engage him into talking more.

I've noticed this lady talks to him too and is kind.

....

The day before it's me, this guy with challenges (everyone there is challenged even if it's the challenge of being poor) and one of my bosses. Plus the lady who gives the grandmother a ride to work (no names or clever nicknames out of respect). A few customers too.

The boss is constantly frazzled and snaps at all of us. This one in particular.

""Yes ma'am."" As I snap to attention. It always blows over. No resentment. Her job is toughet than mine. I get that.

But on this particular day she is snapping at the young dude. He's had enough.

""It's not against the law to have water.""

He's raising his voice. Literally frothing at the mouth.

After two or three repeats, I'm not egging him on. 

""You tell her ____ there ain't no laws about people working hard having water.""

She walked away.

Who cares if they fired me.

For what?

Agreeing with the dude getting yelled at for no reason.

I didn't mean to troll her. I couldn't resist.

A few customers were laughing.

That blew over too.

We'll see how long before I blow out of here.

When he was walking out he noticed my syrups and he asked me, ""So what are these?"" I respond, ""They're syrups for our drinks."" So he proceeds to tell me that they fall under a **syrup and extracts license** AS WELL AS [a cannery license](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-913.23) in Ohio and that we have to immediately cease production and forced me to dump all my syrups down the drain. He said that after we secure the licenses ($200 and $100 respectively), we also need to send him PH, Brix, an ingredients list, and recipe steps for every single syrup every single time we make them.  
  
After months of not making our own syrups, we have talked to almost 30 coffee shops in Ohio and not a SINGLE one has ever heard of this license and all 30 of those shops have been making their syrups for YEARS. Seems like we are being picked on and picked on and I would like to know if anyone has been in any similar situation and what you did because we're about to lawyer up at this point.

Here is the [definition of a cannery](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-913.01):

>(A) ""Cannery"" means a place or building where fruits, vegetables, or specialty products are packed in hermetically sealed containers and thermally sterilized and the products of which are placed on the market for general consumption as human food, regardless of where the product is sold in commerce.

We are NOT hermetically sealing the containers and we are NOT selling the syrups on the shelf. We are using the syrups in coffee drinks WITH MILK. Here is the section that ODA keeps referencing. ""To be used in making"" is the one they keep referencing.

>(D) No person, other than a manufacturer or bottler holding a soft drink plant license under this section, shall sell, offer for sale, use, or have in the person's possession with intent to sell, any soda water syrup or extract or soft drink syrup, to be used in making, drawing, or dispensing soda water or other soft drinks, without first registering the person's name and address, the name and address of the manufacturer of the syrup or extract, the number and variety of such syrups or extracts intended to be sold, and the trade name or brand of those products, with the director, together with such samples of the syrups or extracts as the director requests for analysis. The person also shall pay to the department of agriculture at the time of making registration a license fee of one hundred dollars. No license shall be granted by the director unless the director determines that the syrup or extract is free from all harmful drugs and other ingredients that, as used, may be injurious to health. The registration shall be renewed annually upon like terms. If any manufacturer, bottler, agent, or seller is licensed or has registered the manufacturer's, bottler's, agent's, or seller's name and product as required by this section and has paid the manufacturer's, bottler's, agent's, or seller's fee, the manufacturer's, bottler's, agent's, or seller's distributor, retail agent, or retail seller using the products shall not be required to pay that fee. This section does not apply to local sellers of soft drinks as to syrups and extracts made by themselves for their own use exclusively.

HOWEVER, according to FDA guidelines, any coffee based beverage is not considered a soft drink when milk is added. 

We are not trying to avoid being food safe. I am very aware of my levels and take the necessary sanitary and food safety precrautions when making my syrups. It's not that we were not already practicing good food safety, it's the fact that we have been picked out, as far as I know, as the only coffee shop in Northeast Ohio that has had to secure this license. It's absolutely ridiculous.",2,1739977568.0,barista,3,0.67,False

1it7hlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1it7hlb/does_rehoming_a_dog_ever_get_easier/,Does rehoming a dog ever get easier?,"My husband and I adopted the sweetest rescue pup over a month ago. From the moment we met her, her sweet little howl-like bark and the ease at which she jumped right into our laps showering us with kisses melted our hearts. When we took her home, it had been years since I had felt that level of joy and excitement. We did everything together. She was my walking partner, my morning coffee date, my work from home assistant, and evening snuggle bug. She was the sweetest velcro dog. When walking around the house she'd turn around every few steps to check I was behind her. She had a dog bed right outside our bathroom she'd wait in while I showered each morning. She bought so much joy and love into our lives.¬†There are more details in my post history, but one day she turned on my husband. We were on the couch and she bit his face quite severely with no warning. Thankfully she's only 6 lbs so my husband was fine, but another inch and he could have lost an eye, so the severity of this incident was not lost on us even though she's small. She tried to go after him again the following night and I was able to restrain her, but was devastated that this was now a pattern, and not an isolated incident. We reached out to the rescue to explain the situation and we also consulted with a professional trainer. The trainer's assessment was that this was resource guarding (I was the resource), and the fact she was so quick to escalate to a face bite of her owner really meant business. They advised that this likely wouldn't be curable, and instead we'd have to focus on lifestyle and behavior modification for both us and the pup to remove triggers. They also advised she shouldn't be around kids. This broke my heart. We are a couple in our early 30s, and while we don't have kids of our own, we live down the street from the town elementary school in a very family oriented neighborhood with tons of kids. Our family and friends mostly live between 1.5 - 2 hours away and have pets and small children of their own, so visits are usually overnights and we had always planned for our pup to come on family visits, she is family after all. Additionally when we travel for longer international vacations (usually only once a year for \~10-14 days, so not often but we do look forward to our 'big trip' all year long), we had planned to have the pup eventually stay with our parents who also have babysitting commitments to our nieces and nephews. We had stressed that a child friendly dog would be critical in order for our pup to truly be part of the family because of these circumstances. And I understand why she was initially categorized that way - she was the sweetest thing until this incident, so I don't blame the rescue at all. It quickly became apparent to us that in order to prevent triggers and avoid setting our sweet dog up to fail we'd be hurting our relationships with our family and letting go of our favorite hobby, travel. We made the difficult decision to send her back to the rescue. They assured us she would not go back to the shelter, and they'd look for an older couple without small grandkids who doesn't travel and would be more suitable to her needs. After we made the decision, we had to keep her a few extra days until the current foster pup got adopted out. In these days, she was back to her old affectionate self with no aggression incidents, which made parting with her even harder. And the fact that our deep bond and her instinct to protect me is the reason I'll never see her again. When we dropped her off she was excited to see her foster mom again and ran right inside. I know this is harder on us than on her (thank god!) but I have not stopped sobbing for 12 hours straight since we dropped her off. In my head, I know we did what is best for her, but there is a hole in my heart and my emotions are running wild, making me second guess our decision. It is taking every ounce of self control I have not to jump in the car and take her right back. Will this ever get easier? To those who have rehomed their dogs due to behavioral issues, how did you cope?  
TLDR: My heart dog turned out to be aggressive towards my husband / not safe around kids and we had to rehome. It is best for all three of us, but I am devastated and need to know this will eventually get better",3,1739977310.0,reactivedogs,3,0.8,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1it7fmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1it7fmu/joe_k_part_2/,Joe K - Part 2,"K was booked in at 9.24am and taken to a holding cell. The Saturday sun shone through the one small window, casting the shadows of its bars over the bars depicted on a poster informing him that *Crime Doesn't Pay*. Behind them, a remorseful face, so stereotypical it looked more like an advert for eugenics, stared out, urging him not to make the same mistakes - I fought the law, and the law won, it said. On the desk below it, was a single sheet of paper and a pencil. At the top of the paper was the heading *Initial Plea*, and under that the word *Name...*, and under that the word *Statement...*, with the rest of the page left blank. ""Am I supposed to fill this in?"" he whispered to himself. Maybe he should wait until he knew exactly what it was he was accused of. Maybe these were just left in all the cells for general use and it didn't really apply to him... Maybe he should fill his name in just in case. He sat down on the wooden chair, carefully printed his name in the space provided, and stared at it until his fists clenched and his whole body tensed up. With pent-up aggression and seething determination he flipped the pencil over and forcefully abused the eraser, repeating - ""No!... No!... No!..."" He refused to give the impression that there was even the slightest hint of acceptability or validity in the whole preposterous, contemptible, procedure he was being forced to endure through absolutely no fault of his own. His caged animal instincts were urging him to shout, scream, punch the wall, and throw the chair against the door, but he didn't want to give them the satisfaction of behaving in such a violent, self-destructive way. He had to maintain the moral high ground. He had to maintain his composure and his sanity.

A few minutes later, he started to feel dizzy and decided to lay down on the bed and try to relax. ""It doesn't look too comfortable,"" he said. ""And what the fuck is that stain?"" When he eventually did lay down on the bed, he made the uncomfortable discovery that it was more comfortable than it looked, and wondered how long they were planning on keeping him locked up in here for, anyway... and what was that camera for? This wasn't fair. This shouldn't be happening to him. He'd never done anything wrong... Well, he'd never done anything illegal, anyway... Well, he'd never done anything wrong *and* illegal... As far as he knew.

With all the time he spent alone in his flat, it might seem strange that he could feel so nauseous after so short a time in this place. After all, he'd slept in smaller rooms than this before. Of course, the bars on the window, the locked, heavy, metal door and the thick, stone, cold walls made all the difference. The key word here was *confinement*. Staring at the ceiling, he could see those walls closing in on him out the corners of his eyes. When he looked directly at them, the ceiling started moving down towards him. He'd suffered from claustrophobia since his brother had locked him in an old trunk at their grandparent's house when they were children. Their grandfather was bed-bound and terminally ill at the time, dying later that day, and the two events formed an association in K's mind that would lead to a lifelong fear of being buried alive, or taphophobia. He closed his eyes and used the tool he always did for dealing with situations like this - his brain.

His brain gave him a distinct advantage over less intellectual, more emotionally intelligent, prisoners like vulnerable people in mental institutions or marine mammals in not-much-amusement parks - they can't logically process the suffering they're forced to endure. Capable of higher reasoning, he was able to let one part of his brain tell a different part of his brain that what it was experiencing was nothing more than a stress-induced hallucination. While rational thought had the chair, it also took the time to remind another part of his brain that he was living in a liberal democracy - sooner or later, they would realise their mistake and let him go. He may even get some compensation for the distress they've caused. In any event, this was certain to end up as a mildly interesting anecdote that few would ever hear and even less would care about. To distance himself from the reality of his physical confinement, he allowed his mind to drift above his corporeal shell and float in the psychological freedom no prison walls could take away. ""You just lay there,"" he told his body. ""I'll come and get you when it's time to go. I know that you are safe now, and freedom can wait. I know that I am free now, and safety can wait. I know that... dualism is the refuge of the idealist - shit!"" He cursed his knowledge for spoiling his reasoning, and found himself back inside the shell inside the cell. At least the walls had stopped moving.

Switching tactics, he counted the tiles on the ceiling. He did it left to right, going down, then down and up, going right, then right to left, going down, then up and down, going right, then left to right, going up, then down and up, going left, then right to left, going up, then up and down, going left. Then he started in one corner and traced the outline of an imaginary ball bouncing off the walls until a fly landed on his face and he lost his place. He watched the fly for while, trying to predict its behaviour. It proved impossible. He wondered if human beings were more or less predictable than flies. He tried to remember the opening lines of some of his favourite novels. ""I am nothing but a corpse now, a body at the bottom of a well."" ""A screaming comes across the sky, it has happened before but there is nothing to compare it to now."" ""Suicide calculated well in advance, I thought, no spontaneous act of desperation."" Was it - ""The first time Yossarian *saw* the chaplain he fell madly in love with him,"" or, was it - ""The first time Yossarian *met* the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.""? ""Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing..."" What? A toothbrush? A knife? His conscience? This was harder than he'd thought it would be. He had more success with Bob Dylan song lyrics, got a lot of *Bringing It All Back Home*, most of *Highway 61 Revisited*, and was struggling to remember the fifth line of the fourth verse of ""Visions of Johanna"" when the door opened and a policewoman instructed him to get to his feet and follow her. Finally, he thought, they've realised their mistake, I'm going home... but not before I have it out with whoever's in charge around here. He thought wrong.

K was lead to a dark, windowless interview room with a table, two occupied chairs and a vacant one. The vacant chair was next to a fat man in a pinstripe suit with a large, balding head and thin wire-framed glasses. Opposite him, a tall, broad-shouldered policemen with brown hair and a matching thick moustache straddling a big, self-satisfied grin, rose and offered K his hand.

""Do take a seat, Mr K, I'm Chief Inspector Dee,"" he said, in an authoritative Oxbridge voice that completed the impression of Stephen Fry in *Blackadder Goes Forth*. ""You know Mr. Ohm, of course?""

""No,"" said K, sitting down and suspiciously examining the plastic cup of coffee in front of him - should he risk it? ""I don't believe we've had the pleasure.""

""Are you sure? He *is* your lawyer, after all. Foster, you remember Mr K, don't you?""

""Well he is in our records, I'm sure of it."" Ohm said in a mid-west Amerikan accent, looking K up and own, lifting his glasses, as if that would improve his eyesight, and putting them back on his nose again. ""But, I must admit, the face doesn't ring a bell.""

""Well, it is a forgettable face,"" suggested Chief Inspector Dee. ""There's not a lot going on there that one can really latch on to, so to speak.""

""Yeah, that must explain it."" Ohm considered the matter settled.

""That doesn't explain anything,"" said K, wondering if he really did have such a forgettable face. ""What explains it is that we've never met each other before. Furthermore, I don't have, and never have had a lawyer so, with all due respect, Mr Ohm, there's no way I could be in your records."" The chief inspector visibly stiffened and shot a glance at the lawyer with enough force to put him straight in his seat, as if Dee was his stoic stepfather and he was a small boy picking up the wrong fork.

""What are you playing at, Foster? This is not the sort of professionalism I've come to expect from your office. You really must update your records. As for you, Mr K, how do you intend to defend yourself without a lawyer?""

""Well that's just it, I intend to defend myself.""

""Defend yourself? It appears that the initial investigation was spot on - you've been reading too many books, Mr K, that sort of thing doesn't happen in the real world. Why, not even Foster here would defend himself, would you, Foster?""

""God, no, I would be completely unqualified.""

""But surely a man has every right to defend himself against his accuser? That's only fair, isn't it?"" Although K had addressed this question to him, the chief inspector clearly had no intention of engaging in what he, no doubt, considered to be a frivolous legal debate, beneath both his standing and his pay grade.

""Your need, or not, of legal representation is something you'll have to discus with your legal representative, Mr K.""

""And what if I don't have a legal representative?""

""Well, if you agree to employ the services of Mr Ohm, I'm sure he'll be willing to explain to you why you had to employ his services - is that alright with you, Foster?""

""I'm more than happy to comply with all my client's requests... as long as they are within the bounds of the law, of course."" With the towering presence of the chief inspector looming over them both, the lawyer took K's meek, reluctant gesture as confirmation that he'd just been hired and continued. ""The problem is that what seems fair, morally speaking, isn't always the same thing as what is fair, legally speaking. A man's accuser will have the advantage of legal representation so he will be putting himself at a disadvantage if he chooses to refuse the same advantage, and that wouldn't be fair. So while it's only fair that a man should be allowed to defend himself, in the interest of fairness, the law cannot allow him to do so.""

""Because the law is fair,"" said Chief Inspector Dee. ""...Isn't it, Foster?""

""...Damn right it is,"" said Ohm, eventually.

""That's settled then, so how about we let this conversation evolve some opposable thumbs before it goes extinct? May I see your *Initial Plea* form, Mr K?""

""My initial... um... the thing is... given that I... um..."" K had lost whatever composure and dignity he'd managed to convey so far and struggled to find the right words. He found himself staring at his coffee and wishing he could go back in time and fill in that form. The written word had always been his preferred method of communication, the only way he'd ever felt capable of expressing himself, and that rash decision had left him at a severe disadvantage. Also, why did he say he was going to defend himself when there was nothing for him to defend? He became acutely aware of how guilty and incompetent he must appear, making any attempt at coherence next to impossible. Yet he was unable to stop his jumbled words escaping. ""...some mistake... I don't know... that is, I haven't... um...""

""The form, Mr K?""

""I didn't complete the form.""

""You didn't complete the *Initial Plea* form?""

""Well, I filled in my name, but... I erased it.""

""You erased it? Why did you do that? Did you forget who you are? You *are* Joe K, the bank clerk, aren't you?""

""Yes, sir... I mean, yes, Chief Inspector.""

""May I have a word with my client?""

""Please do.""

""You're not Joe K, the bank clerk, you're Joe K, the cleaner.""

""I'm Joe K, the cleaner."" He looked at Chief Inspector Dee. ""I'm Joe K, the cleaner.""

""Well, at least we've cleared that up. Now are you beginning to see why you need a lawyer, Mr K? As for the *Initial Plea* form, we can make an exception for someone with... *special* circumstances, we are a very progressive institution these days, as our press statements prove. If you would like to request *special* assistance we are only too happy to accommodate you. We have a very good... *special assister* on call. She's not based in Glowbridge but your welcome to wait in one of our holding cells. It should only be a couple of hours, maybe three, depending on the traffic.""

""No!... I mean, I don't have... I mean, that's very good of you, but... ... ""

""Go ahead, Mr K and, rest assured, whatever you say in here will be held in the strictest confidence."" K looked at the voice recorder on the table and the camera in the corner.

""I don't know... I don't know...""

""What don't you know?"" the chief inspector loudly and impatiently interjected, slamming the palm of his hand on the table and frightening Ohm, who may have been falling asleep, more than it did his newest client. The immediate effect on K was to focus his mind on the main point it had been fumbling around for in all its nervous confusion. Simultaneously, his long-term memory dumped something else into his mind, something from George Orwell he chose to take more literally out of its original context, if only to deliver a much needed boost to his already low and rapidly deteriorating confidence - *Ignorance is strength*.

""I don't know what it is I'm accused of,"" he calmly declared, as if that would clear everything up and put the interview exactly where it needed to be. Unfortunately, he was the only one who saw it that way.

""You don't know what it is you're accused of?"" was Chief Inspector Dee's incredulous response. ""You don't know? Have you ever heard of such a thing, Foster? You've got your work cut out with this one, old chap, it'll be a miracle if you win this case.""

""But I'm innocent,"" said K.

""Finally, we get a plea. Thank you, Mr K, that's so good of you, and on behalf of the police force let me extend to you our eternal gratitude. There is just one thing to clear up though, if you don't mind. How the fuck can you say you're innocent when you don't know what it is you're accused of, you imbecile?""

""Can he really speak to me like that?"" K asked his lawyer.

""Oh, it's completely unacceptable and, as your legal representative..."" Ohm began coughing and reached into his breast pocket for a handkerchief. ""Excuse me... as your legal representative I strongly..."" He resumed coughing into his handkerchief, this time for a good twenty seconds. ""As your legal representative, I strongly advise you not to let it happen again. It's not good for your case at all. I suggest you take some time to think about your behaviour."" He finished his coughing fit, wiped his mouth and quickly put his handkerchief away while the chief inspector stared down at K like a frustrated piano teacher would a ham-fisted student. It was a look that said - ""I'm not angry at you, I'm just disappointed in you.""

For a long minute, the only sound in the room was the insistent buzzing of the electric light above their heads. It was unbearable. He had to give in and sip his weak, oily coffee - worse than he'd suspected, like aniseed and rotten eggs - just to calm his nerves. Then, after K had been subjected to this intimidating demonstration of power long enough to satisfy the chief inspector's perverse will, he leaned forward, put his elbows on the table, his fingers together and flashed a big, friendly, moustache-crowned smile.

""Now that you've calmed down a bit, may we continue?... Mr K?... may I call you Joe?... thank you."" With a soundtrack of overdramatic exclamations, he consulted his notes for a further half a minute before continuing. ""You live alone, Joe, is that correct?""

""Yes.""

""How old are you, Joe?""

""Fifty.""

""Are you married? or have you ever been married?""

""No.""

""Any children, living or deceased?""

""None.""

""Can you explain?""

""Explain what?""

""Explain how it's possible for a man to live for half a century without getting married, or at least co-habiting, and having children.""

""As far as I'm aware, it's not illegal to be single and childless and, if you're trying to imply something about my lifestyle, your interpretation of the law is as antiquated as your attitude and your instincts are entirely misguided.""

""Joe, please, I'm not implying anything, I'm merely trying to build a profile. If you're not a homosexual and you're not a monk and there's no record of you ever seeking any medical help for any... particular dysfunction, then why have you never got married or had any children? It's a very simple question.""

""And it's a very simple answer - it's just not something I've ever chosen to do.""

""I'm sorry, Joe, but what sort of an answer is that? It's not something *anyone* ever chooses to do. Sure, we choose *who* we have a relationship with and *who* we have children with, but humans are a coupling, procreating species by default. It's what we're naturally predisposed to do, and you've taken a conscious decision to defy that. You've told Mother Nature to fuck off, Joe, and I want to know why.""

""Well, that's one way of looking at things, I guess, but, given the current state of the planet and the obvious contribution humans have made, and continue to make, to that, and the ongoing population explosion and habitual expansion of our ecologically destructive species, you could argue that I'm one of the few people who are *not* telling 'Mother Nature to fuck off.'"" Having felt he'd made his point, K finally found enough self-confidence to meet the chief inspector's gaze for more than a second, but Dee refused to be the first of them to back down and patiently stared back with the curious detachment of a biologist, until he'd successfully established whose eye was on the microscope and whose face was on the slide. Once the natural order was resumed, he continued to examine his specimen for several seconds before writing something in his notes.

""Are you a misanthropist, Joe?""

""No.""

""Yet you live alone, you work alone, you have no family and no friends.""

""I have friends - not many, but as many as I need.""

""Need for what?""

""For...""

""Say 'no comment',"" said Ohm. K gave him a quizzical look. ""As your lawyer, I advise you to say 'no comment'.""

""Why?"" said K. Ohm leaned towards his ear.

""Trust me, I know how this tricky son-of-bitch's mind works, it's better to say nothing now than to get caught in a lie later.""

""But I've no reason to lie, I'm innocent.""

""I think it's best we don't mention that again, you know what happened last time.""

""No comment?"" K cautiously suggested to the chief inspector and immediately found himself feeling guilty.

""During the search of your flat, we found no mobile phone, no computer and no internet access. Furthermore, and despite the efforts of our top boffins, we were unable to find any online presence of you what-so-ever. Not one account, profile, video, photo, comment - not even a solitary email. You're a nonentity in virtual reality and a virtual nonentity in reality. I'm having a hard time believing you even exist. Who are you, Joe?""

""I'm just a cleaner.""

""A cleaner, yes, a cleaner... who reads."" Dee consulted his notes again. ""Two thousand, four hundred and eighty books were found in your flat - that's a lot of books.""

""I like to read.""

""Evidently, but what else do you like to do?""

""Say 'no comment'.""

""No comment.""

""What do you believe in?""

""Say 'no comment'.""

""No comment.""

""Are you a nihilist, Joe?""

""Say...""

 \- Her interest increased a bit more (but not substantially), and you start dating, and when ‚Äúnew relationship energy‚Äù is over, her interest lowered and you started chasing more, which led to even less investment in the relationship from her side, and over time she initiates the breakup

 \- Her interest in you was not big to begin with, and all your efforts to flirt more or have dates failed.

I am sure this is familiar with 95% of the guys who are reading this. We all experienced that. While we also know other ‚Äònaturals‚Äô who are really good with not just getting a girl but also keeping them as well.

*‚ÄúBest relationship dynamics is where the woman is chasing the guy. And the guy is focused on his duty. Anything other than this, you will find unhappiness and dissatisfaction‚Äù*

So let‚Äôs start by defining the state we want to have with our partner by defining good behaviours we want to see:

**Good Behaviours:**

* She initiates daily interactions first. She texts you without necessity, she randomly calls you. She reminds you of herself.
* She wants your attention. She also tries to conquer your attention. This means, if the time is right, she dresses to provoke your lust, or if you are going to an event together, she dresses classy so that you will feel that she is the best girl out there.
* She cooks/cleans/irons for you. This may or may not be important for you. But the truth is, if she is interested in who you are and if you make her feel really good, she will do these things not because she is a girl but because these things are fundamental comforts for humans.
* She fucks you. She initiates sex, and she is the one who is fucking even though she is the one who gets fucked. It will be hard to understand if you never experienced sex where the girl is really into you. I know many such guys exist. But in reality, you want her to do the foreplay even when you are the one who seems to do the foreplay.
* She is loyal to you. And she shuts down all doors which lead to getting closer to her, which includes not being too drunk, not having close male friends, etc.

These 5 features are what 99.9% of the male population desires. Yet ironically, only 1% can have such a woman in his life.

We are gonna unravel some secrets regarding the behaviours of these %1 guys who get to have such women. Some prerequisites are necessary:

  
**Prerequisites:**

* The same woman who is bitchy to you might cook/clean/iron for another guy. With you, she might never initiate sex, but with another guy, she might suck his dick with pleasure even though his dick smells.
* People change. They change daily, even. But like a compass, our fears and desires and habits regulate how we behave towards certain people.
* Timing the action matters as much as the action itself.
* None of these things work unless you know how to create value as a man. Looking sharp, having status, and good finance come first. Without these things, you will be ignored.
* Whenever you want to understand women in emotional situations, use this metaphor: women are like cats. What would a cat do in such a situation?

**Let‚Äôs start.**



**Secret 1: Being Selfish**

All the guys I met who were really good with women share this common feature, with no single exception. Because being selfish makes you highlight features where you show your own value regardless of the situation, which corresponds to her having a vision of you as a high-value person.

Some of these selfish guys I know were narcissistic people. Since I was friends with them, I knew their life, and their life was full of stories. One generic example is: they meet a nice girl, she lives far away, and the guy tells her she is far, and he can‚Äôt travel. They keep talking, and in the end, she ends up traveling 45 km by taxi to come and meet with him, only to get fucked in his no-bed apartment while he prematurely ejaculates in about 10 minutes, and then he sends her back without treating her any good.

If someone else were telling me these stories, I would say they are lying. But they are true.

I was curious for a really long time why these girls put up with such selfish guys until one day I realized it was the selfishness that made them attracted to these guys in the first place.

It is also important to understand that selfishness doesn‚Äôt mean demonstrating inflicting harm on others. Selfishness is an extreme demonstration of self-worth/value/care at the expense of empathy or established social norms.

It is too wide of a topic, and I want to focus on practibility so we will talk about how to radiate this  selfishness vibes

 **Method 1: Be Bored**

When you are in a meeting, show that you are bored or you might start getting bored. If everything is interesting for a person, that shows that person is not interesting himself. During the conversation, be attentive, but at some point when she is eager to talk about something, be non-attentive and dismissive, both with your body language and with how you answer/proceed with that topic. You can do this by checking your phone in the middle of the conversation or looking out the window or abruptly changing the topic with an unrelated question. This is powerful.

A second thing to note here is how you stand‚Äîif your torso faces her or it faces the other side. But the important thing is always to look for comfort while maintaining your good posture. When you sit, make sure to take extra space since this shows self-confidence as well.

**Method 2: Through Comfort and Habits**

A very simple real-life example: I was ordering in some coffee shop. There was one girl behind me. I asked the cashier for an espresso. And then, because I felt extra tired that morning, I asked for an extra shot (which means more dense coffee for the same drink). The worker was new there, and she was surprised, and her friend heard what I asked and showed her how to add it to my order really quick. And I could feel how the whole vibe changed there. I also noticed that the girl behind me started inspecting me. It was due to me being a guy who cares about the density of his coffee and knowing how to adjust for it in coffee shops. Something so silly and simple, yet it shows that I do things intentionally and differently than others and I care about my own comfort more than usual. 

Looking for small optimizations and asking for them. Like asking for a bottle of water on a plane. Some people can‚Äôt do that. Or when you are asking for an address, asking the person to walk with you to show it if the place is really close (this sounds weird, but it commands respect, and the person who you ask the address will help you, thinking you are someone who deserves such help just because you are able to ask for it).

Asking for an extra pillow, or chocolate toppings on your vanilla dessert, etc. These all create a particular image in the eyes of your observers. And girls are really great observers even tho they do it subconsciously. When you care about such thing you show that you have a specific lifestyle you like to follow. You know what you want when it comes to these small things, which implies you know what you want with big things such as relationships or purpose of life as well. And by showing people you have criterias in life, you make them wonder if they will match your criteria as a person or as a girl, and hence they will start questioning if they are worthy or not‚Äîwhich again is the mindset we want from girls we are dating.

I also want to say these things I am sharing are the results of my 5 years of on-field research. And I am summarizing them with examples so they are not too abstract like ‚Äúinner game.‚Äù I hate it so much when a so-called pickup master uses some fuzzy-meaning word and tells you to work on it or improve it. Fuck these guys.

I don‚Äôt know who will read these lines, but I want this post to exist because when I started my own journey, I couldn‚Äôt find any book that talked about these things, even though they mattered a lot. And now I cracked this secret I want to put it out there. It is okay if it doesnt resonate with you %100.  Reading this will open up your mind towards correct direction and you will one day understand the same thing but maybe with different words.  

When you master selfishness, you will see that it solves most of your dating problems. I remember reading a book about how to satisfy a woman in bed. I watched videos about it as well‚Äîhow to move your hips during sex so she feels the most stimulus and so on--. I read a book about giving cunnilingus, twice. I drew a pussy and understood the anatomy so I could please women well. These were not bad things to learn, and yes, they helped. But in the end, my friend with no ass wash, who also read no books, was keeping his girls while I was losing mine.

I remember sex not being fun anymore. I was licking her pussy, fingering her, fucking her in different positions, and indeed she was enjoying it physically, but mentally this does not arouse her. Mentally, she finds it unnatural. She wants to be the one who satisfies you. She wants to be with a man whom she feels obliged to satisfy.

That‚Äôs why being selfish matters for men. I have seen guys who play video games while their  sexy girlfriend is trying to get their attention, but they don‚Äôt care. And I was thinking, ""wait what? If she was my girlfriend, I would give her attention whenever she wants"". And I did not know this kind of mentality was the exact reason that girl wouldn‚Äôt date me in the first place.

When you become playful with women, try to be a selfish prick and you will see that they adore you even more. It is what they want to see after all.  For them to be submissive to you, first you must become something that deserved to be subbed. 

As a result of such a character where you are being selfish, if she keeps dating you, then subconsciously she accepts to submit to your will and accept the self-worth you have shown, which matches our defined ""good behaviors"" in the beginning.

Note: As mentioned in prerequisite 3, timing is essential. You will have to learn the timing and frequency of showing selfishness by yourself.

**Secret 2: Fuzziness & Indifference and Power of a Good Pause**

For a long time in my dating life, I had this cycle:

Cold approach > high interest from a girl > texting and setting up dates > lower interest from a girl > date > another messaging period and setup dates > even lower interest from a girl ....

And I had no idea. Over time, I fixed my common messaging mistakes, yet I knew something was still missing. And that thing is among this title. (You can read my notes regarding text game here)

You all heard of the power of the pause. If you are speaking, it can make you come across as a high-value person, and if you use it wrongly, then you sound like an idiot.

The pause in text game is also similar. (I am not talking about answering the girl in the same time period she answers you. That‚Äôs basic. We are talking about more advanced things here. I will give you a solid example.)

Let‚Äôs say you get a number, and you are texting with a girl. You want to date-close it. And you texted her, ‚ÄúWhat are your plans tomorrow evening?‚Äù and she answered, ‚ÄúTomorrow I am busy. I have work 10‚Äì22.‚Äù And that‚Äôs it, she doesn‚Äôt say anything else. Now that‚Äôs not a bad answer from her end, but also that‚Äôs not a good answer either, because she did not add ‚Äúbut I am free the next day.‚Äù

What I usually did was immediately ask her, ‚ÄúWhat about Friday?‚Äù etc. And it actually worked. She says, ‚ÄúYeah I am free,‚Äù and we actually meet that day. But you just lost a mini-battle there by this extra efort and also accepting her not giving you a proper answer and therefore lost some of the leverage, and the dynamics started to change in a way we do not want.

Here is the thing: **if you want to have a girl with the ""good behaviors"" we defined at the beginning, you need to take the wheel in your hands from the very, very beginning. How she perceives you is extremely important for the first couple of dates and even before that, during texting.**

Like I said, I was getting dates, but over time, I was feeling my high-value energy in that particular relationship was getting lower and lower to a point where I was trying so hard to meet with her, and she stopped putting effort into our meetings in terms of how she looks or how she behaves, etc.

So it is extremely important not to lose the first battle. And the first battle starts with texting. So, because I am who I am and I am the king of self-improvement, I started to experiment with pausing. The same scenario happened with another girl. She answered, ‚ÄúTomorrow I am busy. I have work after classes‚Äù and this time I did not reschedule. I did not write anything. Mind you that my initial approach was good as always, and I made sure there was interest from her side before leaving the scene, as always.

So what happened next? The next day, she sends me a message out of nowhere: ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù which I answer, and then I initiated another small conversation where I invite her to a really fancy restaurant. She said she doesn‚Äôt like such places‚Äîshe is financially poor and probably insecure‚Äîand instead of investing more in her rejection like I would do in old times, I just answered her with ‚Äú?‚Äù. And this is how you induce fuzziness and indifference. That ‚Äú?‚Äù can mean many things. And she starts thinking about all these meanings.

*If meeting up with a girl means losing your leverage significantly, don‚Äôt. Do a small retreat and do it properly.*

Next hour, she sent me a video message explaining her thoughts about such places with a huge smile and IOIs. 

You get my point. Fuzziness is a skill you have to learn. It makes the other person think about you, even fantasize about you.

One Russian girl(23 yo at that time) I knew was, very, very cute, and also smart. She had a Russian boyfriend. She could have anyone she wanted because she was living in Turkey. But she was obsessed with her boyfriend who is in Russia. Whenever we talked about her relationship, she would say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when he will propose. I guess this summer because we will go on a vacation together,‚Äù and he did not propose anything. In my mind, I would marry her in a second if I could, and I did not get why this guy wasn‚Äôt marrying her or giving her a date at least. And then I came to understanding that this was how he got her in the first place. What happened is they were together for 5 years in total. He got to fuck her between 19‚Äì24, which were her peak beauty years, and then they broke up. After that, I lost communication with her, but on social media, I could see she was dating a low-value rich orbiter guy who pays for her travels. She was not happy. And I know that she still thinks about same russian guy while same russian guy dates another 22 years old cute russian girl.

You want her to do the emotional thinking. You want her to dream about your future together, and one way to do that is to be indifferent.

Be indifferent to her beauty. Even though you love her so much, you can‚Äôt show it most of the time. Treat her like she is a usual person. She should understand you like her, but has no idea how much or on what scale.

*Here is a secret:* **whenever someone meets you, they are secretly hoping that you are someone they can admire. And therefore, they are ready to admire you unless you give them a reason not to.**

Just being self-grounded and consistent in your way of doing things is enough for most people to respect you. But the moment you show your desires, wishes, and project your pain/stress to others, they start losing respect.

You, of course, have met such guys. They are not pianists or artists. They have a normal job, but yet people admire them and respect what they do. It is because of two things. First, these people are probably showing signs of inner satisfaction (some call this aura or charisma), and second, these people are fuzzy and indifferent. Like if she works in a coffee shop, she is indifferent to whether people like her or not, or what people think about her working in a coffee shop. If someone asks her, ‚ÄúWhy do you work here?‚Äù she would answer, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù You don‚Äôt really understand them, but you know for sure that, for themselves, they make sense.

If your actions are fuzzy like my ‚Äú?‚Äù message, and if she is someone who wants to admire you, she will find a meaning she enjoys from your fuzziness.

whenever you are dating you must utilize this a lot. She must wonder about you. For example, one thing I really liked in a book called ‚Äú3 Percent Man‚Äù is that when you start making dates, don‚Äôt set up dates for weekends until she asks for a weekend date. So, I try to make dates on Friday evenings and say I am busy during the weekend. And imagine you go through a couple of dates all on weekdays, in the end she will think about this situation and wonder, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt he taken me on a date on Sunday?‚Äù

And the moment she thinks like that, you have the leverage. It is not a win. There are no definitive wins in relationships.

That‚Äôs the end for now. I hope this will save years for someone out there who is trying to navigate in the current dating world.

They put buying new house on hold in the 1st month of us dating since we had this connection and they knew I had to be close to the city for work.  They really feel lost and at this point want to try nomadic living for a while and likely settle somewhere else (or ""settle"" in finding seasonal work).

I meanwhile am a late bloomer.  I have 2 careers that I have to be in person for.  I've since developed a 3rd side hustle that I can probably afford our COL on that is remote or at least I can do on the road.  I had a number of years where I lived nomadic in my 30s.  I do like this life and fantasize about it also.

I feel torn on what to do.  I've been hustling hard the last few years since I've finally had a couple of breaks in fields it's difficult to do well in.  There are very few ""jobs"" in my careers: career 1 is music and honestly impossible to duplicate elsewhere (I tried other cities in my late 20s and 30s, it just worked best for me here); career 2 usually you either start your own business and it takes a big financial outlay and years to make it MAYBE successful, or you string together a bunch of jobs.  I managed to have a job (btw all these ""jobs"" are 1099- yes probably illegal, but that's what exists?) where I have almost full time hours.  Mostly it's good but I've been incredibly burnt out for a variety of reasons and also feeling physically unsafe at times due to working alone often in the inner city with occasional run-ins with disturbed people.  It's rare but it's frustrating.  The job was never supposed to be like this- I was hired told I would always have an admin with me to take care of admin/cleaning as well as not be alone.  The pandemic changed everything with that.  I've tried to stand up for myself but it's only gotten so far, my boss (who I never see in person, unless I run into them at a local coffee shop) is nice but increasingly checked out.  The last incident 2 weeks ago with a drugged up dood who refused to leave the office (FINALLY did after half hour) and police never came, and blase response from boss since has really gotten me over the edge.

My spouse thinks I should just leave and take a reset with them to travel (like them I also fantasize about that, but I've actually done it before so my itch has been scratched at least once in life.   I've also lived both in other parts of this country, and abroad) but I'm really nervous about this since it's so hard in my careers.  Also I have a lot of student loans; I'm currently aiming for forgiveness but I'm terrified of what the new admin could do- I could literally be paying anywhere from $0/month (current payment) to $9k/month (worst case 10 yr plan) or anything in between, depending on what the current admin does, not looking good the way they are blowing everything else up on their whim.  It feels impossible to plan my life around now.

For instance in the last year there were only 3 jobs on indeed or local career fb group within 25 miles for career 2.  I was offered all three after interviewing.  One job paid peanuts, kind of degrading work, and was per diem, no guarantee of hours.  The other two turned out to be much fewer hours- one would only start you at 1 day a week, and you'd only ever get up to 3 days max.  The other one was 2 days a week but required Saturdays with no exceptions (current job I work Sats but I can shift shift earlier or later if I have career 1 work, and take off on rare occasion).  Career 1 I'm lucky enough to be in a couple regular groups but if you miss too much you'd get replaced.  They are all based here.

Besides all this I'm trying to figure out how this would work.  My spouse said they absolutely will not do nomad life without me, I've suggested they try some longer trips by themselves but they said the real test now is us in a breadbox together for longer than any trip we've done (longest was a week in the rv).  Best guess is flying back and forth for career 1.  This is our best plan and spouse is mostly ok with this, they know I need to keep doing music here.  This \*could\* be possible as I have a way to get highly discounted flights and generally I love flying and travel and airports, but I'm just feeling overwhelmed/burntout in the current moment.

Financially we are decent- house, cars, rv in good shape and all paid off.  We each have a decent retirement savings (I've hustled hard to catch up) but not anything crazy.  I'd definitely have to keep working to keep us afloat even if student loans magically disappeared but we could conceiveably scale the hustle back as long as loans don't go bananas.

How do we manage my spouse's desire to make a new start but keep some semblance of a career I love going for me?",1,1739976882.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I am a college student living in a house with 4 people. One of my roommates complains non-stop about the 'white people shit' that the other roommates do, including our 'white-passing' Native American roommate. They just won't fucking stop, and as far as I am aware, nothing that we're doing is actually 'white people shit.'

Some examples:

* """"Holding grudges and not telling him when we're mad at him"""" (doesn't happen btw, each of us has been very open about our issues, it's just that he doesn't care when we bring it up, then gets mad that we didn't complain about it harder somehow. Also, he talks shit behind people's backs 24/7)
* Eating sardines/canned fish. 
* Eating potatoes.
* Drinking coffee.
* Eating the pizza that we agreed on splitting (he wanted to have leftovers and 'didn't expect the pizza to be that small. Still expected me to pay half.)
* Telling him to smoke outside or at least through a window.
* Telling him to wash his dishes.
* Asking him to clean up after his mess in the living room.
* Having parties.
* Playing board games.
* Drinking.
* Not drinking.
* Not ordering food for him on Door Dash.
* Watching old movies.
* Watching Lord of the Rings/Game of Thrones.
* Knitting.
* Brewing alcohol (legally, it is kept out of eyesight)
* Any hobby that isn't video games.
* Being in a relationship.
* Being asexual.
* Being autistic.
* Not wanting to fuck him.
* Literally so much more.

  
If at any point he was joking, I didn't catch it, and it wasn't funny anyway. And most of the time this isn't him just saying ""oh that's white people shit haha"" it is like an entire rant about how only white people do it and how it's bad. My Native American roommate shot back at him exactly one time with a mocking version of his rant and now he talks shit behind their back unironically saying she wants his entire race dead. 

He is moving out at the end of the lease. Thank god.

I pay for my bills with my part-time pay and try to maintain the $200 allowance I usually get monthly. The only time I ever use my credit card is if I need money for food, which my aunt allows me to use whenever I‚Äôm hungry and don‚Äôt have money to pay for it.

I basically live with my boyfriend‚Äì Or my boyfriend lives with me. He spends the day, afternoon, and night at my apartment, 24/7, 7 days of the week. He does not pay for any of the bills nor pays any of the rent. In my apartment, I have my own personal PC setup. I bought a new PC (from what I would say is recent) last August and I feel like I have not been able to use it as much as I‚Äôd like.

Even when I bought the PC, I was not the one using it the majority of the time. This was fixed for a little bit, as my boyfriend‚Äôs parents bought him a PC as a joint Christmas gift. But, it was at his apartment, so he still didn‚Äôt really use it often. His apartment is a 5-minute walk from mine.

This month in January, he had to sell it. He did not have any money to pay for food, bills, rent, transportation, so he had to sell it. By not having any money, I mean 0. He lost his money to gambling, so therefore, he had to sell his PC. He has been having his monitor and multiple mousepads for sale, but he still has not been able to get someone to buy it.

I told him before making this sale that he needed to stop gambling. Doesn‚Äôt matter if gambling is what helped you pay for the monitor‚Äì gambling is bad either way. But he told me, ‚Äúit makes me happy‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt make money from gambling last December, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to go to \_\_\_ together.‚Äù I told him repeatedly to stop gambling and to save money. I also told him many times that I didn‚Äôt want to hear or have anything to do with it. But he still proceeded to talk about it all the time, and before I knew it, he sent me a text saying that he has to sell the PC because he lost all his money.

In the end, he lost even more because his parents bought his PC at \~230,000 yen and he was only able to sell it at 140,000. It‚Äôs sad to see but I sadly cannot find myself to sympathize because I warned him repeatedly not to gamble anymore.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gambling anymore (from what I know) after having to sell his PC, but now it‚Äôs affecting both my studies, work, and leisure time. I work part-time remotely, so I usually work on my PC in the morning/afternoons for about 2.5 hours during weekdays before class. He is usually sleeping during this time. Then, we have class and I have to continue working, so I either have my Mac laptop to work on campus after classes, or we go home and I‚Äôm forced to use my broken and laggy ROG Zephyrus laptop. He is using the main desk, so I always have to use the coffee table and the floor couch.

The only times I ever get to use the PC (MY PC that I also bought with my own savings and money) is for work and perhaps 2-3 hours every other day. Every other hour outside of that, my boyfriend is the main one using the PC. He has a Mac laptop as well but he only uses that for class. I understand that he no longer has a PC, but I don‚Äôt get time to use my PC for fun for any more than 2 hours. He uses it for every other activity of his, whether it‚Äôs homework or games. Even when I go to sleep or get ready for bed by midnight, he is up playing or just using the PC till the AMs, whether it‚Äôs 3am or 6am.

I just genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do because I don‚Äôt get to use my own PC. Even since the day I bought it and he got his own PC, he was still the one using it majority of the time. I play a few games that are about 2.5 hours and he can play the PC all night. He gives the excuse that I‚Äôm sleeping, so it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt count‚Äù. When we play games together, I‚Äôm still on my laggy laptop sitting on the floor couch hunched over. I always get tired of playing easily because my back hurts from sitting there for so long.

I want to actually be able to manage my own time on the PC. And feel like I own the PC. I asked him what he was going to do after selling his PC and all he said was, ‚Äúthen I don‚Äôt have it‚Äù. I feel like I don‚Äôt even control anything in the apartment despite the fact that I pay rent and bills, which include the electricity that keeps the lights and PC and heater on all night when he‚Äôs on and I‚Äôm sleeping.

My sister kept waking me up when trying to sleep so I got pissed and moved out then and there.  


What happened after was me and two other guys moved into a small house that was 3 bedroom. The home was unfamiliar to me. But it was legit haunted. At first it was small things like the ghost would move things like hit a drum once or move a coffee cup so it fell. We assumed it was because of a roommate (unknown why).  The dream escalated where it was possessions  and making clones of roommates. I has trouble dealing with it because  lots of people starting coming over and my roommates urgency about a ghost haunting our home dropped.  I kept trying to call the bank to give the home back on the grounds ghosts where trying to kill us and ghost hunters but nobody would answer. Finally the bank did answer and I had trouble speaking with them because i was juggling the call and the ghost trying to kill me.  The bank sent somebody over who would rent it from us because they liked ghost which was a relief until they turned out to be the ghost playing tricks on me.  The dream got really weird  even more than before i was trying to find somebody not possessed to figure something out because at that time just about everyone was but nobody was taking anything seriously.  But then i saw Obama in the crowd visiting I wanted to pull him aside to ask him to help but the alarm went off and I woke up.  


It wasn't a night mare or bad dream at all.  Just weird like I do not recall having a similar dream.  I wanted to go back to sleep to finish it.  ",4,1739976730.0,Dreams,1,0.83,False

Their wedding is a destination wedding, so to ease the burden on friends who are travelling for the wedding they have decided to celebrate the end of their bachelor/ette-dom together a few days before the big day.

It's a group of about 20 people who don't know each other very well at all (with the exception of a few of the bride's friends who are pretty close). I believe that most guests are coupled up but there could be a few singles. We're starting at a private space in a bar and then will move to bar hopping afterward.

I was thinking about a quick game of ""Get to Know You Bingo"" that has a prize at the end to encourage mingling. My main objective is that this party doesn't devolve into tiny little cliques of 2-3 people. I want everyone to have a blast so the wedding feels comfortable and fun for everyone!

I separately had an idea to distribute disposable cameras to everyone and put together a list of items to photograph over the wedding weekend, kind of like a scavenger hunt but without any stakes. And then having the photos developed into a coffee table book for the bride and groom. But this isn't really a group activity, so not sure it counts.

Just as a disclosure I bought this as a refurbished model. It arrived and basically looked brand new but just didn't have the lid over where you pour the water. Each time I'm using 18 grams of beans and aiming for around 60 grams of espresso. When I make the coffee, the puck ranges from soupy to a slightly soupy puck that I can easily press down with my finger and leave an indent. I'm not sure if the puck should be a little more solid with difficulty to remove from portafilter.  I've identified two issues with my setup:

1. I struggle to have the GCP hold a temperature above 195 F for 30 seconds even when trying temperature surfing
2. Using the Timemore C2 I've found a setting of 7 clicks to be really slow sometimes the shot doesn't start pouring for like 10-15 seconds after hitting the brew button. These shots end up pulling at around 50-60 second to 8 clicks where the shots are pulling at around 15 seconds.

I actually just tried the pressurized insert this morning for the second time and it pulled at around 28 seconds but unfortunately the GCP didn't keep temperature the whole time and the shot was a little cold and a sour flavor. It wasn't terrible but know it could be improved upon. It looked like a good speed but I just can't get the temperature dropped by I'd say 18 seconds into the shot.

The main temperature surfing procedure I tried:

1. Turn on GCP and let run for around 20-30 minutes with portafilter on.
2. Hit the brew button when the light is on and I'm ready to go. Let water run through until light turns off.
3. As soon as temperature light in middle turns off, I hit the steam button and let it go for 10-15 seconds as I put on the portafilter, put scale underneath and then get mug ready.
4. Switch off steam button and hit brew button instantly.

We've been working together for like half a year now, but the first two months of that I was at the end of a pretty toxic relationship (idk if the context is important but it was with a guy, I'm bi, and we have gone no contact in the past month which is a win for me but thats a whole ass other story) - I didn't really develop any feelings for this girl until the start of this year though as we never really worked together before then (I was 100% single by then). I think I'm struggling with it all a lot because I've been out of the game for like 3 and a bit years now.

Until very recently I think I was a little in denial about actually having a crush - I get that most people don't wanna ""shit where they eat"" so to speak, and I have always thought tryna find someone at work was a bit stupid because when it doesn't work it can make work awful for the people around you. That said, I can't really help how I feel.

Recently though, some coworkers have mentioned that they noticed us flirting back and forth between each other - I know from my end I try to crack jokes and make her laugh because I find that to be the main way I can connect with people (friends or even romantically, I just like being a funny person I guess?) Some of my work friends have told me that they can tell my mood changes when she's around and they kind of called me on it - this made me admit to them that, yeah, I do have a crush on this girl. They also said that they noticed her flirting back - I tried to not dwell on it too much though because I know sometimes people like to just flirt, its a very human thing to just flirt and joke and what-not so I really tried to not think too hard on it but now I think I've over-thought my way into a corner of sorts.

Anyways - one of my friends at work (27F) spoke to my crush and (as she put it to me) ""playfully broached the subject of us flirting and maybe playing cupid for us two"" to my crush. Her response was along the lines of ""well I think he's funny and I enjoy his company at work, but it's totally platonic."" She doesn't know (at least as far as I'm aware) that I know about this conversation (for what it's worth, I didn't know it was happening until after it did).

Obviously not the best thing to hear - but I think my question is more in regards to is this a ""never going to happen, don't ruin the vibes"" type situation, or a ""maybe give it some time and ask her out, see what she says"" type beat?

I can earnestly say I don't want to make things weird - if it's a matter of ruining the current dynamic just to shoot my shot I don't know that I'd want to do that. I really like cracking jokes and making her laugh, but I also think I'd be kicking myself if I just never ask? I don't want to make her uncomfortable either - and since we work together (at least 2-3 days a week) I wouldn't want her feeling awkward or anything at work since no-one deserves to feel like that.

I really do like this girl - I'm pretty sure my crush started developing because talking to her is so easy. She makes me laugh, I think I make her laugh (she's snort-laughed at some of my jokes) and I really appreciate the fact that when we talk I'm not carrying the whole conversation - we both ask questions and carry our weight as such (hope that makes sense?).

What should I do? What do people think? I'm happy to answer questions and provide more context if people need it - I was already thinking I may give it a few weeks and ask her to coffee or something casual like that but I also want to make sure if I do that she has the space to say no and not feel as if my asking makes work uncomfortable (if people have suggestions there that'd be great too).",1,1739976314.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

(Beans were pre-weighed and in cellars, is that cheating?, Eh, add two minutes.) 

I probably could have done all three shots in 14 minutes with single preheat cycles and laying out all the bits and bobs the night before.

I was active starting back in 2014.  Over the years, while being married myself, I had 2 long term SR's, one just under 2 years and the other, almost 3 years.  About 15 mos ago I separated permanently from a 40 year relationship, bought another house and moved out.  Divorce isn't on the radar for several years, it's the epitome of ""complictaed"", trusts, properties, assets, etc.  We were good in business together, but not on the ""keep the fire going"" side of it.  My ""drive"" has remained strong, while hers waned in childbirth and menopause as well.  

I decided to retire last year and I am now looking at getting back in the game.  I am in Colorado for any SB's in the area.  

Funny thing, my first SB texts me out of the blue 2 weeks ago.  We met in '16 and spent 2 years together, she married in '20 and had a little girl in the interim.  Now, she wants to grab some coffee and catch up.  I've already told myself that it has to remain platonic, no matter her intentions.  I don't want her to have those feelings that one does often when playing in this arena.  Anyway, just curious how many other's have had similar type scenarios present themselves.  Thanks...

This ended up being A LOT longer than I intended, but I‚Äôve had luck meeting a partner on reddit in the past so here‚Äôs hoping that fortune is once again on my side and there is somebody smart, kind, and fun out there today who will be intrigued by what I have to say! The type of person I am looking for won‚Äôt match a certain physical description or geographic location so much as she will be attracted to some of my qualities and how she thinks they will match with her own.

I am an intellectually curious person who strives to be compassionate, emotionally intelligent, gracious without being taken advantage of and adventurous without being reckless. I‚Äôve yet to discover the meaning of life or the ultimate purpose of existence but I do try to live with a purpose, grow, and help others when I can. Politically left and LGTBQ-friendly. The thing I love to do most when I‚Äôm not working is read. The perfect day for me is a Saturday where I can wake up in the morning with a cup of coffee and simply enjoy a good book. I‚Äôve managed to add a little more fiction to my literary diet over the years however at this point it is clear that my passion lies with history and philosophy, but really I just love to learn and learning about another person‚Äôs interests and particularly my partner‚Äôs passions is very important to me, it‚Äôs the basis for the greatest form of intimacy. I‚Äôd like to think all this reading makes me a wiser if not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù person in some way, or at least a more empathetic partner and less boring to talk to, either way it would be great to meet a woman who is also a philosopher at heart.

I like to play chess, improve my Spanish ever so slowly, and I also really enjoy watching and discussing films and television, it‚Äôs a great fun way to get to know somebody and how they think, whether in person at home or at theater or on Discord. Much culture these days is various grades of content slop but a companion to experience and analyze it all with would be wonderful. I am a big fan of museums too! I get up early in the morning to work out six days a week and generally try to live healthy, but this is not something I expect my partner to emulate, though it would be great to have a gym buddy, especially a woman with aspirations to get big and strong! üòÅUsed to play video games often but these days only rarely Paradox and other strategy games. My job involves a lot of driving and I have a dog I take on walks daily so I listen to a lot of podcasts about news, history, some comedy and other variety. I also have a cat. They both get along great with each other as well as other pets and humans. I take an interest in the world, strive to be involved in my community, have no kids but would love to start a family!

Overall I‚Äôm a chill but low-key passionate kinda person, introverted and sorta eccentric in my primary interests so it‚Äôs hard to meet people. I‚Äôm mostly a homebody but love a good cafe and am comfortable with silence but I am a good listener and when I trust a person I am not afraid to open up, that is the intimacy I most seek. Physical connection is of course important but it‚Äôs all based on a special emotional connection so I‚Äôm open to long-distance relationships at first, if we have the chemistry I trust we will find our way to each other sooner rather than later. I am ready to find that person I can be devoted to, where the communication comes easy and clear and the connection is hitting on an intellectual, emotional and physical level. Not seeking to rush into anything but intentful. Pics are available on request.

I still drink caffeine off and on I just prefer decaf as I can drink more of it without any real considerations around over caffeinating myself ü´†

I settled on hardlines decaf for a longtime that I was brewing as espresso and having as americano and cortardo but, I‚Äôve recently discovered the new world of pour over and it just wasn‚Äôt cutting it for pour over.

Please leave some suggestions for good uk decaf beans that you think may tick a box! My list is here so far 

Hit list >>

Process
Plot
Crank house
Kofra
Oddkin  - ordered 
The source 
Formative - ordered 
Square mile - ordered 
Spaceboy 
Coaltown - ordered 
Decaff coffee club - ordered 
ozone 
Dark arts 
Hydranger

Oynx 
Zennor coffee -ordered

elsewhere coffee 
Kapow coffee 
Drop


So far my top 3 are 

1. Oddkin - Columbia hiula, fruit fermented, sugarcane

Flavour notes - passion fruit, mango, yoghurt 

Thoughts - 

My gosh what a fruit bomb of a coffee! Exactly the type of thing I have been searching for, it‚Äôs just full of apricot and peach vibes such a delight! 

I‚Äôm genuinely excited by this as it gives me a lot of optimism to find loads more great coffee just like this. To top it off it was only rested 4 days so looking forward to see it develop! 

2. FORMATIVE - DECAF - Finco Paraiso 92, Cauca, Colombia

Red Bourbon, special process - EA:

Flavour notes - Apricot, passionfruit, strawberry candy

Thoughts - 

Wow another home run with these beans! I get loads of sherbet, lemon, palma violet really lovely fruity mixture! 

Again probably will develop a bit further with some more resting and pushing the extraction a bit more but wow it‚Äôs amazing what you can find if you look for it! Cant wait to try more! 

3. The rare one decaf coffee club - COLOMBIA
JAIRO ARCILA

Flavour notes - tropical Turkish delight 

Thoughts - 

Delish first bag of decaf from decaf coffee club! Nice and juicy got loads of pineapple! Really impressive stuff and just the thing I was looking for compared to previous bland decaf beans. Can probably tweak the recipe to get some more flavour but highly recommend this one for people looking for some more interesting fruity decaf.

I created an account on Seeking in october 2020, I spoke to a lot of woman (including celebrities but could not afford them), but one attracted me. We met for a coffee and then went for shopping and kind of started liking each other. I did once book a place for us but she refuse to come and i met a lady for ONS(via seeking!!) and then had a chance meet on a girl on another occasion. By the time, the first lady and I got committed, I deleted my SA profile.

This is what she told me, She wanted only one SD, she had one and he moved to US, she had lot of issues in life and is looking for someone to take care of her. She was divorced with a 7 yr old kid. I kind of got close to her, resolved all her financial troubles, took her to a temple before we had sex.

Meanwhile, i didnt want her to be single and requested her to reconcile with her husband which she did. They reconciled and planned to come together in few months. This is when the girl i met by chance came and pestered me for a meet but i told her about my SB (just bare line, no details). Somehow she figured out who I am talking about and proved to me that she is going with other SDs as well.

I literally broke up with her, lost Lakhs of rupees and was depressed for more than a year.

I again created a profile this year, met a 24 year old girl from down south in TN and she said, she wanted to be Mono with me and wanted large sum of money from for me to solve her troubles. I just created one more TG ID and could see that she was not genuine. Again a gold digger..

Either i dont understand a Sugar relationship or woman here want to be just prostitutes and not SB. A SB is mono with one SD who takes care of her. AM I wrong?

Like it says in the title, I‚Äôm hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it‚Äôs nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I‚Äôm a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I‚Äôm the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that‚Äôs not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let‚Äôs take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!

Newbie question, sorry!

The manual from my Eureka Mignon Zero says the following:

""The adjustment must be made gradually, grinding a little coffee every 2 notches at the most"" [source](https://www.eureka.co.it/public/files/catalogo/74/Mignon%20Zero%20Range%20-%20User%20Manual.pdf). It doesn't say anything about it being turned on or while grinding beans... Also, what does ""notch"" mean? Are those the numbers? E.g. from 2 to 3? Or the increments betweent 2 and 3?

On this page ([Clive Coffee](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/eureka-mignon-zero-user-manual)), it says: ""When moving from espresso to pour over, i.e., fine to coarse, it is okay that the grinder is not running. When making large adjustments back to espresso, i.e., coarse to fine, it's best to have the grinder running so that it does not jam.""

It does not say if beans should be ground when turned on...

Says I am grinding some strong coffee in the morning, which must ground quite finely (e.g. 2.0), but then in the evening, I want to grind some other coffee which need to be ground more coarsely (e.g. 3.8) and needs a medium adjustment.

How should I do it?

Mr Hunter busies himself posing the excited children. First with the twins in their school uniforms and then in their more casual jeans and tee shirts. Amos is added occasionally to the compositions, while Willa stands back awaiting any instructions for coffee or drinks.

The maid‚Äôs secret is that he is now wearing fresh panties, obviously the sort of frilly ones he was instructed to wear by Marvin, his Master. But he changed into them without his Mistress‚Äô or her lover‚Äôs permission, simply because the others were filled with Mr Hunter‚Äôs dried semen.

The clean knickers feel nice on his smooth buttocks.

Mr Hunter asks the happy couple, ‚ÄúYou want a picture with the kids and the maid?‚Äù

Marvin raises his eyebrows in thought. ‚ÄúYeh. Let‚Äôs have a couple.‚Äù He turns to Willa, who immediately stands to attention. ‚ÄúMaid, on your knees in front of my children.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Master.‚Äù

How it stings to hear Marvin refer to Willa‚Äôs twins as his own children, but he knows better than to protest.

Willa kneels before his own children with them looking down at him with smirks.

‚ÄúNo, you daft bitch,‚Äù Marvin says, ‚Äúwith you facing the camera!‚Äù

Everyone laughs at the maid‚Äôs silliness.

As instructed, Willa turns around on his knees to see Mr Hunter looking down at him with narrowed disapproving eyes.

‚ÄúAnd try and smile, you dumb maid,‚Äù Marvin says to general laughter.

‚ÄúYes, Master.‚Äù

Willa smiles as the photographer clicks a few more photos.

Apparently satisfied, Mr Hunter starts packing his stuff into bags. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get these shots framed as you requested, Marvin. Get them back to you tomorrow.‚Äù

As the kids dash off to the playroom, and his Master and Mistress approach Mr Hunter, Willa reasons it is okay for him to stand without permission. Like most experienced maids, Willa is unsure of any action that he takes under his own initiative. There is always the fear of someone shouting at him to stop and do something else.

‚ÄúYeh sure,‚Äù Marvin says to the photographer. ‚ÄúHey, Jackson, we usually get back by eleven. So how about twelve tomorrow? That work for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeh great. Fine.‚Äù Mr Hunter nods, carefully packing his camera.

‚ÄúMaid, help Mr Hunter out to his car with his kit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, no,‚Äù Mr Hunter says quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù

Marvin says, ‚ÄúNah. It‚Äôll make her feel useful, won‚Äôt it maid?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, Master.‚Äù

Oh no! He would have to be out near the car with Mr Hunter. Only a few hours before Mr Hunter had forced him down over his own kitchen counter and taken advantage of him!

As Willa carries the boxes down to the car, he is aware of the cooling breeze tickling his bare thighs above his stockings, under his dress. Being outside in stockings always makes him feel exposed.

He is keeping his distance from Mr Hunter until he hands him the tripod to go into the back of his estate car.

Their eyes catch, and Mr Hunter says, ‚ÄúListen. You don‚Äôt mention a word of what happened. You got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, Mr Hunter. I promise.‚Äù

Never had a promise been more eagerly made. Willa had no intention of ever sharing with anyone what took place in the kitchen.

As he lets the rear of his car close, Mr Hunter softens.

‚ÄúListen. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ well ‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt help being a gay boy. And I don‚Äôt judge you or anything. But you wriggling around like that and everything ‚Ä¶ your arse ‚Ä¶ that cute face ‚Ä¶ I mean, Jesus. What do you expect?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Sir,‚Äù Willa says rapidly, wanting the conversation to be over as quickly as possible.

He smiles. ‚ÄúYeh. Great. Knew you‚Äôd understand.‚Äù

For a moment they stand facing each other, eyes fixed before Mr Hunter shakes his head, as if shaking away an idea. He opens the car door. ‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù

Jackson Hunter‚Äôs eyes roam up and down the maid making Willa feel on display, before finally driving off, his face in the door mirror fixed on the short skirted maid‚Äôs legs.

A relieved maid walks back to the front door feeling world of tension slip form his slender shoulders.

As soon as he closes the front door, he is brought back to earth.

Amy is standing with her hands on her waist as if impatient.

‚ÄúMaid! Me and Heather need drinks and snacks.‚Äù

Willa hates being spoken to like that by his six year old child but until the situation in the house is reverted back to how it should be, he knows how he is required to respond.

‚ÄúYes, Miss Amy. Right away Miss Amy. Would Miss Amy and Missy Heather like chocolates too?‚Äù

Amy shakes her head as if addressing the dumbest person in the world.

‚ÄúOf course, maid! Now hurry up.‚Äù

Nibbling on his lips, Willa says, ‚ÄúOf course, Miss Amy. Right away.‚Äù

Later that night, with the kids in bed and a blindfolded Willa cuffed to the bed, with his legs splayed apart by the usual blue ropes, Avery unlocks the spiked chastity cage ready to replace it with the standard one. By now, the nightly ritual is second nature to the pair.

Avery is in a happy excited frame of mind.

‚ÄúA lovely dinner again, Willa. Your Master was really impressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Willa beams with gratitude. ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôll give me a couple of smiley stickers for my chart?‚Äù

Cleaning her maid‚Äôs groin with a warm cloth, Avery says, ‚ÄúYou never know. I‚Äôll ask him for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, thank you, Mistress.‚Äù

Willa never feels comfortable asking for smiley stickers.

Snapping the non spiked chastity cage in place Avery smiles at the delightful look of the shaved groin, with the narrow landing strip of her maid.

She removes the blindfold and is about to uncuff her maid, when she stares at the panties parked half way up the maid‚Äôs thighs. She leans back.

‚ÄúMaid. I put you in cream panties this morning. These are white ones with pretty blue bows to match the ruffles.‚Äù

Willa instantly blushes feeling that his Mistress already knows the humiliating reason he had to change them.

When the maid looks guiltily back at her, Avery narrows her eyes, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you change them without permission?‚Äù

Willa strains his head to check his bedroom door is closed before lowering his voice. ‚ÄúMistress?‚Äù

Stroking his lovely blonde hair, she says, ‚ÄúYou okay, Willa? Have the kids upset you again? I see the way they treat you and ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mistress,‚Äù suddenly Willa is speaking rapidly, though still ensuring he is whispering. ‚ÄúMr Hunter. Oh, Mr Hunter! Oh! Please, it wasn‚Äôt my fault, really I ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my,‚Äù Avery shares her maid‚Äôs concern. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Pulling on his steel handcuffs, feeling totally vulnerable with his legs fixed apart, Willa says, ‚ÄúMistress. It wasn‚Äôt my fault. He pulled down my panties and ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Suddenly Avery is angry. ‚ÄúDid your Master spank you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no! Mistress. It was Mr Hunter. Well, no he didn‚Äôt spank me. He shoved me over the kitchen counter. And then he lifted up my dress and then he, ‚Ä¶ will he ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he fuck you?‚Äù Avery is shocked.

‚ÄúNo. No. Well, not really, he,‚Äù Willa feels his cheeks glowing red with shame, ‚Äúhe came over my bare bottom.‚Äù

Avery laughs with both relief and amusement. ‚ÄúWow. Did you tell him to stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Willa is shocked. ‚ÄúWell, no. I ‚Ä¶erm ‚Ä¶ no ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Avery unlocks her maid‚Äôs cuffs and stands up straight.

‚ÄúNot sure what to make about that. I sort of love the fact that I own such a hot maid that you make guys do that. But I don‚Äôt know. I mean you are mine. Shouldn‚Äôt he ask me for permission?‚Äù

Willa sits up not daring to untie the ropes from his ankles. ‚ÄúMistress, it‚Äôs not my fault. What should I have done?‚Äù

Settling down on the bed, next to her disturbed maid, Avery‚Äôs voice softens. ‚ÄúI guess, maid, I best get used to the fact that guys are going to want to have their way with you. But don‚Äôt tell, Sir. Jesus! He will do his nut that a man has done that to his maid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get Mr Hunter into any trouble.‚Äù

Avery laughs. ‚ÄúYou slut. You loved the attention!‚Äù

Willa squeals too loudly, ‚ÄúNo, Mistress. No.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Avery embraces and kisses her troubled maid. ‚ÄúEverything is fine. We‚Äôre going to have to deal with this. I guess. I never thought about it. I mean you do look hot in your maid‚Äôs outfit. And I guess, maids are the number one male fantasy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, I love you Mistress. You are so understanding.‚Äù

He puts his arms around his Mistress as she hugs him closely.

Suddenly she pushes out of the embrace and grins mischievously.

‚ÄúThis is interesting. And unexpected. My maid can get orgasms whenever she inserts her Master‚Äôs vibrator into her sexy and in demand arse. I mean, you do realise that all guys get erections around sexy girls like you. Wow, this is so crazy. So like any other woman you now know that any male can make you cum whenever they want.‚Äù

Willa is processing the comment. Surely not. Not any man, not with him.

‚ÄúMistress, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you. When your Master‚Äôs vibrator enters you, you love it. You perform like a total whore.‚Äù

‚ÄúMistress, I ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd every aroused guy has an erection that can take you to that special place. We girls learn it at a very young age. And now you know it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMistress. No, surely ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt makes us so submissive in front of dominant males. Now you will feel that submission before all men. If a guy takes an interest in you, and I can see why they will, then you know they can make you cum.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Mistress, I ‚Ä¶‚Äù

She kisses him to shut him up.

‚ÄúSilly maid. All a bit of a shock for you. But,‚Äù she pauses with a wide grin, ‚Äúthat we both need to get used to the fact that I have a maid who attracts men.‚Äù She laughs. ‚ÄúI guess I am going to be as protective as a stern father when his daughter is the centre of attention for a group of men.‚Äù

Willa‚Äôs eyes grow huge. ‚ÄúMistress. I am scared.‚Äù

Her impish grin pucks into a laugh. ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôre not. I bet you love it! Especially as Sir says that with you locked up you are forever randy.‚Äù

The door crashes open. The awe inspiring masculine frame of Marvin fills the doorway.

‚ÄúLeave my maid. Let‚Äôs get it on!‚Äù

Avery says, ‚ÄúSir, do you ever stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot with something as hot as you around!‚Äù

Avery leans down and whispers in her maid‚Äôs ear, ‚ÄúSee what I mean?‚Äù

She pushes her body into Marvin‚Äôs until he cuddles her.

‚ÄúAnd you maid,‚Äù Marvin says, ‚ÄúNo playing with my vibrator tonight.‚Äù

Willa nods, ‚ÄúOf course, Master.‚Äù

‚ÄúPrivileges from you and my kids are to be earned in my house!‚Äù

Willa wanted to point out that this is his house, but then wondered if it still was. After all Avery‚Äôs dominant sister, Nicole, had removed his old name William Fallow from the bank accounts and mortgages.

‚ÄúYes, Master.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get yourself some smiley stickers. Two. Put them on your chart, tomorrow morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, thank! Yes, Master.‚Äù

With that the passionate couple are gone.

Moments later, dresses in the lovely outfit Avery had laid out for him for his bedtime, purple boy shorts and camisole top with white stockings.

Climbing into his single bed, Willa drags the pillow between his legs and presses his imprisoned member up against it.

Dreamily he thinks about sharing those wonderful confidences with his Mistress and how adorable she is. He is such a lucky maid. He squirms, and sighs, his thoughts erotically drifting to his Master paddling him. His fantasy suddenly switches up the brute using a cane on his bared buttocks.

All that thought of pain and submission eases his mind away until he is floating far from reality.

Suddenly he feels himself to be pushed down over the kitchen counter. Mr Hunter is behind him.

He can hear the masculine voice and the words, ‚ÄúSlutty, gayboy‚Äù and ‚ÄúTramp‚Äù.

They are spoken with contempt and anger.

It is as if he can feel Mr Hunter‚Äôs man spray covering his bared cheeks.

Willa‚Äôs pounding of the pillow increases until he comes in his chastity cage, spraying uselessly through his cage.

In his dreamy state he can hear himself mumble, ‚ÄúYes, Mr Hunter. Thank you, Mr Hunter‚Äù, before drifting away into a beautiful silky oblivion.

As Avery guides the boisterous kids out to the car for the school run, Willa skips on his heels to fetch the table tennis bat for Master to give him the usual morning maintenance spanking.

Willa had proudly added the two smiley stickers to his chart, as instructed by his Master the previous night, but was disappointed that no one had noticed or commented on them.

If only Avery hadn‚Äôt forced him back into the spiked chastity with that morning‚Äôs usual routine procedure. Obviously, Willa appreciated that it was kind of Master to let him sleep in his smooth chastity cage, but he was always terrified when his wife cuffed him to the bed and set about changing the smooth one for the dreaded spiked one.

It was always so terrifying to lie blindfolded and helpless while Avery locked on the ghastly spiked cage to his member. There is something about not being involved in the changeover that makes him feel wholly vulnerable and helpless.

But with the children out of the door, Willa was already setting about his second morning ritual: the maintenance spanking with the paddle.

The morning ceremony with his Master is only different because this time, Willa has something to say to Master. Something highly important.

He hands over the bat to the grinning Marvin who loves his dominant position in the household. In a matter of weeks, he has become the Master of the sissy cuck Hubbie, acting husband to the sexually rampant wife and father to three wonderful children sired by the dumb cuck.

In fact, master of the entire household. And every morning, without instruction, the cute sissy maid fetches the bat for her morning beating. All without complaint.

As the maid pulls down her overly frilly, lilac panties and leans forward, Marvin taps the bat against the already red and sore cheeks of the maid.

Everything is magically in its place to service his needs.

So it is a shock that following the spanking, the maid stands, fidgets up her panties and strokes down her dress and looks away from Marvin without thanking him for the beating.

Finally, the maid humphs in thought before spluttering, ‚ÄúMaster.‚Äù .

Such mannerisms are normally cute and even sexy to Marvin, but right now he has a hot wife and his kids waiting in his car to be driven to school.

‚ÄúGet it out, dumb tramp.‚Äù

The maid giggles, his eyes still unfocused.

‚ÄúWell, Master. I wonder if today, I mean I am just asking, if we can try me in just the ordinary cage. I mean, oh dear, what I mean is not have me locked in the spiked chastity cage. You see ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMaid. You are coming along well thanks to my training, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes, Master.‚Äù Willa is concerned that his master might not know how flattered he is that Master lavishes so much time on him. ‚ÄùI am so grateful, really. I really am. Oh yes. But you see ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFor fuck‚Äôs sake, just say it. You‚Äôre as much a dumb bimbo as your Mistress!‚Äù

As angry as Willa feels about his Mistress being insulted, he decides to ignore the provocation for now. ‚ÄúYes Master.‚Äù He offers a false giggle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that, you see, at the moment, my little thingee, you know, down below ‚Ä¶‚Äù he points to his groin but sees that Marvin is now darkly impatient. ‚ÄúWell. You see, it doesn‚Äôt rise up. I mean, just as you said it would learn not to rise. So anyway, I was thinking ‚Ä¶‚Äù

With the chat over as far as Marvin is concerned, he throws the bat to the maid who, as usual, drops it.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Marvin says. ‚ÄúHow many stickers have you got on your chart?‚Äù

Marvin grins as the sissy maid looks so pleased with himself as he announces, ‚ÄúSix Master.‚Äù

‚ÄúClever girl,‚Äù Marvin says. ‚ÄúGive yourself another two, and I tell you what. You get to ten stickers and I‚Äôll have a think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank you Master, thank you. Thank you so much.‚Äù

Willa is in the doorway, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you two get to talk about, but we are running late.

Marvin‚Äôs phone sounds, and he pulls it out with a growl.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù

The maid and mistress smile at each other at how impatient and irritated their man is.

‚ÄúYeh?‚Äù Marvin‚Äôs eyebrows furrow. ‚ÄúEh?‚Äù he shakes his head and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get back to you.‚Äù

Avery asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Business?‚Äù

The Bull glares down at Willa making the maid look away and rest her hands on her tender bottom through her silky dress.

‚ÄúTell me, maid, why does Jackson want you to be his maid this weekend?‚Äù

Willa is flabbergasted.

‚ÄúOh, well, I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶‚Äù His mind drifts back to his humiliating moment in the kitchen the previous afternoon, with him pressed flat down over the counter.

Avery approaches with a knowing, mischievous grin, ‚ÄúMaid, you don‚Äôt have an admirer, do you?‚Äù

Absent-mindedly brushing out the front of his dress, Willa is shocked. ‚ÄúMistress! No!‚Äù

Marvin says, ‚ÄúI bet Jackson wants some free house cleaning. Well, it isn‚Äôt going to happen!‚Äù His eyes narrow at the trembling maid. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt offered your cleaning services to Jackson, have you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Master, no. I promise.‚Äù

Marvin fixes the maid with a hard glare. ‚ÄúI decide where you work and what you do. Got that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Master, of course Master.‚Äù

Avery grabs the masculine man‚Äôs arm and steers him to the front door. ‚ÄúCome on, Sir.‚Äù She finds a moment to grin back at her maid to give him a smiley wink.

Willa grins. It is as if he and his Mistress are getting one over their Master. As soon as the door closes, he giggles to himself. It‚Äôs not so bad being a maid he thinks.

¬†

In fact Willa is a happy contented maid for the next hour or so.

He is able to tidy up his old master bedroom in double quick time. He only pauses with a sickening feeling in his tummy when he is putting Master‚Äôs suit jacket into the wardrobe and sees that all of his own clothes have been removed. The boy clothes as Marvin had so cuttingly described them were no longer in existence in what had been his own home.

But he sorts out the girl‚Äôs room in record time and even has time to vacuum‚Äôs the upstairs landing. He is well ahead of his usual morning schedule when the doorbell rings.

Oh!

He swallows hard. Should he answer? Won‚Äôt he look ridiculous in his maid‚Äôs uniform? He tiptoes downstairs as the demanding doorbell clangs away as if ordering him to open the door.

He is now stood at the door when it dings again.

Holding his breath and adopting his best smile, he opens the door.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Willa says before stepping backwards. ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù

It is Mr Hunter.

A grinning Mr Hunter, wearing jeans and a tee shirt, that though it isn‚Äôt tight, reveals very firm muscles down his arms. At his feet are piles of narrow boxes.

Poor Willa feels her cheeks glow bright pink.

Mr Hunter grins. ‚ÄúWell, maid. You going to let me in?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù

What should he do?

He vows not to make the ‚Äòoh‚Äô sound again as it must look ridiculous to a man.

‚ÄúWell, Sir. Master and Mistress won‚Äôt be home for another hour or so, and I ‚Ä¶‚Äù

His words tail off with the shame of saying to a visitor that he cannot invite them into his own home without permission.

With a determined stride Mr Hunter steps in thumping the door open wider.

Willa again just exclaims, ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù

The tall man pulls in the boxes before going to his car to bring in more narrow containers, all of different sizes.

With everything inside it is Mr Hunter who shuts the front door cutting out the chill.

Standing next to such a masculine man makes Willa feel small, feminine and rather vulnerable.

He wonders if Mr Hunter is thinking about how slutty Willa was the previous day when Mr Hunter forced him over the counter and ‚Ä¶. Willa closes his eyes at the shame of what he did and how Mr Hunter deposited his sperm on his bared bottom as if claiming a trophy.

Oooooh! Now his little dick was inflating in its spiked chastity cage.

‚ÄúYou okay, sweetness?‚Äù

Mr. Hunter appears to be concerned, and Willa speaks while taking deep, nervous breaths. ‚ÄúOh no. yes, I‚Äôm fine. I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get in to trouble from Marvin for letting me in early?‚Äù

Willa thinks. ‚ÄúOh. Well. I, I ‚Ä¶‚Äù Why is thinking so difficult for him? Suddenly he has a realisation, and his shoulders relax. ‚ÄúOh no, no problem, Sir. Now I remember. My contract says I must fully obey guests.‚Äù

Mr Hunter laughs. Is he laughing at Willa?

Willa needs to explain. ‚ÄúSir, my contract emphasises how I must always be respectful and something else with guests. I forget what it is. Oh, and I must make reasonable efforts to comply with the instructions of all guests.‚Äù He wrinkles his nose. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs other stuff too. Gosh so much. Can‚Äôt remember it all.‚Äù

With twinkling eyes Mr Hunter stares at the flummoxed maid. ‚ÄúSo you have to do whatever I tell you?‚Äù

Willa giggles, feeling his cheeks now burning red.

‚ÄúAh, well. Up to a point Sir.‚Äù Willa looks doubtfully at the floor. ‚ÄúI think. Oh, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, put your hands on your hips.‚Äù

Willa does so immediately, awaiting the next instruction with eager eyes. He feels so much more at ease when obeying others.

‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù

Oh Willa loves it when someone says those words to him, especially as Mr Hunter is impressed with Willa‚Äôs obedience.

‚ÄúPut your hands on your head.‚Äù

Willa giggles. Now Mr Hunter is being silly, but he complies immediately hoping for another compliment for his compliance.

‚ÄúWiggle your gorgeous arse.‚Äù

With his cheeks on fire, Willa looks away as he obeys, his eyes flicking back to the confident, grinning man to check if Mr Hunter is watching. Satisfyingly, Mr Hunter is not only watching but inspecting the maid‚Äôs every movement.

‚ÄúTurn around!‚Äù

This instruction is made more firmly, and Willa can hear Mr Hunter‚Äôs breathing growing heavier as Willa turns, keeping his hands in his hair.

‚ÄúDid anyone tell you to stop shaking your arse?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Sorry, Sir.‚Äù Willa feels dumb for not continuing to wiggle before the tall man who now is filling his hall and filling Willa‚Äôs mind.

‚ÄúMy God. That arse of yours!‚Äù

Willa giggles, her shame overwhelmed by how amusing this all is. It is so lovely being appreciated.

The hands grip Willa‚Äôs hips so suddenly that he stops wriggling. But he quickly resumes, knowing he hasn‚Äôt been told to stop the action.

Mr Hunter has leans down, so his mouth is close Willa‚Äôs ear.

Mr Hunter whispers, ‚ÄúSo you have to obey my every instruction?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Willa is finding it difficult to breathe. It is as if he is drowning. ‚ÄúI, er, well, yes, I ‚Ä¶‚Äù

The strong hands propel him forward, so he is forced up against the wall.

‚ÄúOh, Mr Hunter, I ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Willa‚Äôs eyes close. Somewhere, deep in his mind is his Mistress‚Äô warning that a guy with an erection will make a woman submit to him. Because the girl knows the erection can make her cum.

‚ÄúYou are a sexy arsed gay boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no, no ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Willa‚Äôs breathily protests but makes no effort to take the hands from his head. His body wants to push back against the man tormenting him. He doesn‚Äôt even stop wiggling.

Willa feels Mr Hunter‚Äôs hand rub around from his hip and push up under the skirt of his maid dress.

‚ÄúSir, please, no, no ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are a fucking little tramp!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! No, no ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

The hand slides easily into Willa‚Äôs flouncy panties and grips the spanked arse hard.

Willa squeals, giggles before resuming the wiggling. The movement is slower now.

‚ÄúSir, please, no ‚Ä¶‚Äù

A trouser fly unzipped.

The sound is so loud it fills Willa‚Äôs senses.

‚ÄúNo, please, no ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Willa hears Mr Hunter rubbing himself and sliding his warm goo over Willa‚Äôs bottom, his fingers attacking Willa‚Äôs bum hole.

‚ÄúNo. Please. No.‚Äù Willa‚Äôs voice is becoming distant. He is groaning, the way his wife does when his Master handles her.

Mr Hunter continues to work on moistening Willa‚Äôs bum crack, his fingers getting deeper.

‚ÄúSir, please, please, no, please ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

With a single aggressive impact, Willa is crushed against the wall, his collar bells tingling as he feels something very hard press up against his bottom cheeks.

‚ÄúNo! Oh God! Sir. Please. Please ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Shouldn‚Äôt he be fighting this man off? Why is his entire body just submitting like this.

It is just as his giggling Mistress had warned him about the previous night.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù

Willa gasps, his eyes opening wide and blank.

Mr Hunter enters him without any problems. The sperm from his dick helping lubricate Willa‚Äôs willing hole.

Willa is no longer wiggling because both Mr Hunter‚Äôs hands decisively grip Willa‚Äôs hips holding him in place while he fucks the sexy maid.

‚ÄúYou are fucking sex on a stick. I‚Äôm going to make you my tramp!‚Äù

Willa‚Äôs body is moving on its own, pushing against the all conquering penis.

‚ÄúNo, no, no. Please. Please. Yes. Oh yes. Oh my God yes. Yes, please. Thank you! Oh, harder. Thank you. Harder. Oh my god. Yes!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're mine,‚Äù Mr Hunter says through gritted teeth.

‚ÄúYes. Yes. I‚Äôm yours. Take me, please. Oh thank you, Sir.‚Äù

Mr Hunter kisses hard at Willa‚Äôs neck. Now he is kissing it. Biting it. Pulling at it. The pain is part of the pleasure for the maid, lost in helpless ecstasy.

Willa is right up on the top of his toes as he is fucked senseless.

And fucked ‚Ä¶

And fucked ‚Ä¶

And fucked.

So, we've been speaking about movies and past relationships and such. Just ""friendly"" chat at least at first. I invited her to have a coffee and she said that she'd love to, but that she wasn't available for like a month. So I took it as a negative response, and continued talking but without much expectations from that part until like 3 days ago.

Last weekend I was at a party and drank a lot. We were talking via whatsapp, and she told me that she was drunk too because was playing a game with friends and I don't remember what else. So I said to her that since we were both so wasted, I could tell her that I think that she's a really nice person and that I want to know her better. She answered saying that she feels the same about me, and that she likes talking with me.

After an hour or so, she also asked me if I liked ""her story"" (she posted a story about her outfit), and there I didn't answered because I was with friends and didn't noticed she had written me. So she said something like \*Oh, is my story so out of place? :(\* and changed topics.

I didn't answered that message next day because I felt like it would feel too out of place, because she started speaking about other stuff and such. But since then, she uploaded 2 different stories that I suppose were for me:

\-One was a meme basically saying ""When I can watch X movie with him"" and a bunch of hearts, and I had previously said that the movie she was referring to, is my favorite movie.

\-One of her from the previous night, showing her outfit (the same that she asked me about) and saying something like ""Is my outfit seriously that ugly? :(""

So, when I saw this last story, I answered saying ""It already looked pretty on you in your previous photo. You're beautiful""

She answered saying ""Thanks"", a heart emoji, and deleted that story immediately. After that, we continued talking about a movie that she was watching and I've already seen, and out of nowhere she told me ""Look, I don't want to talk right now. Sorry, I'll talk to you later. I'm seriously not feeling okay"". I told her that it's okay and she can talk with me about whatever she's facing if she wants. She left me on read and haven't spoken to me since.

What did I do wrong? Was my comment out of place? Like... I don't know, it wasn't the first time that I said to her that I think she's really pretty (in fact, my first message to her was saying that she's cute lmao). We haven't directly flirted but my intentions were clear since the start, so that's not what's happening here.

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\
https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9\
\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The drivers are Markaudio MAOP 11.2. I posted a while back wanting to build my first 2-way with a 2.5""-3"", paired with 8"" woofers. Well, I caved and bought - to date - my biggest and most expensive full-ranger. I will eventually pair these with woofers, but for now I am enjoying the bass out of these. Tuned them to about 65 Hz (-3dB, with Hornreap) but I could not measure to confirm as my UMIK-1 unfortunately died, along with the amp you see on the coffee table. I replaced that amp with a Fosi BT20A Pro as you can see, and have yet to replace the mic. There is a lot more bass gain than I anticipated so I had to tone it down with the amp. The bass port flares out like a horn as you can see in the last image. The kidney-shaped section is to give extra volume to compensate for the driver.

I went with the bigger driver because I'd be using them woofer-less for a while. 3"" drivers wouldn't be enjoyable for very long. These are excellent. The mids are the best I've ever heard. I'd be keeping them this way for a while.

You may have noticed the left and right speakers look different. I was experimenting. The left speaker had the infill showing by printing the infill first before walls. It actually failed near the end of the print so I had to print the top 20 mm separately and glue it on. The right speaker is with walls first.

You may also notice that the prints aren't exactly pristine with all the gaps and voids. That's wood PLA. Notoriously difficult to work with. First I couldn't get them to stick to the bedplate, then I couldn't get them to flow consistently enough. These have a higher wood content than typical, making them more difficult to work with. But, I like how they turn out. Makes them look quite natural. I stained them with a Walnut finish. The black PLA is a very high matte finish. Again, a but more difficult than typical PLA. The ones I got seems to shrink a lot more after cooling, and prone to warping.

We rent from our aunt, we do NOT have a lease we just go month by month. I moved in originally because I wanted my own space and he couldn't afford to live alone anymore. The entire time I have lived with him, he hasn't had a job (I knew that going into it) which I wouldn't have a problem with, if he had been doing stuff around the house. Every day I would come home to a huge mess, food all over the kitchen, coffee table, etc. I bought 7 new spoons because we kept losing them and I'm pretty sure I can only find 2. I cleaned up after him many times, bought new parts for his vacuum, new filters for the furnace, all the food, paper towels, etc. I paid for everything. The only reason I wasn't complaining is because he always had his part of rent. His boyfriend has given him more than $25,000, and he has nothing to show for it. He sits at home all day, buys galaxy gas, cocaine and weed and listens to music at the highest volume he can (we live in an apartment complex). Last night, I was in my room with my boyfriend and my brother decided to start blasting music so loud if was shaking my room. Each of us (me and bf) asked him multiple times to turn it down, which he did but then turned it back up in increments. After probably 6 times of him doing this, I decided I had enough and went out and turned it down myself. This whole time he's hitting nitrous and just being overall weird. He stands up and says ""this isn't your apartment you have no legality over anything in here, I don't come out here and tell you to be quiet when you're screaming"" (for context I am autistic and have meltdowns sometimes, but the screaming is maybe 10 seconds vs 2 hours of blasting music) I had asked him nicely multiple times to turn it down. He turned it back up so I went to unplug his speakers and he got up in my face threatening me and we fought and he left 2 huge gashes on my neck from his fingernails. I'm not going back, I'm not paying next months rent. I don't know if I was in the wrong or not. AITAH?

1it6mla,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1it6mla/50_days_in_and_zero_noticeable_benefits_so_far/,50 days in and zero noticeable benefits so far.  Should I keep going?,"I averaged about 80 mg of caffeine per day (1 large cup of half-caf) for about a decade before quitting about 50 days ago.  I did a 2-week ramp down from 80 mg to 0 mg, so I never really experienced any headaches or other side effects other than perhaps slight fatigue a few days and some changes to bowel habits.

I'm right around day 50 of zero caffeine, and honestly, I'm not seeing any benefits.  To be very clear, I'm also not seeing any negatives.  It's just a neutral.  Don't feel like I'm sleeping any better or worse, and my Oura Ring and Apple Watch sleep metrics appear to be essentially the same as they were when I drank coffee.  I still wake up 1-3 times per night to pee.  Still takes about the same amount of time to fall asleep, and I wake up at the same time.  Same amount of deep sleep & rem sleep.  I don't notice any meaningful reduction in stress or anxiety.  No changes to appetite or eating.

Just no meaningful changes that I can detect.

Any reason to expect I might start seeing benefits if I continue the zero caffeine journey?  I know some people say they continue to see new benefits for the first 100+ days.  But from what I can tell reading this sub, pretty much all of those people were seeing at least some benefits at least by the 50 day point, and I am not.  So I'm kinda thinking that I'm probably never going to see any benefits.
