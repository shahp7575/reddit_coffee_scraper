1fulkoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1fulkoe/plain_skyr_mixed_with_0cal_coffee_syrup_or_maple/,Plain Skyr mixed with 0-cal coffee syrup or maple flavoured syrup is my new go-to protein snack/meal on a cut,"I just had a 268g bowl of Siggi's Skyr 3.6% m.f. Icelandic Yogurt mixed with 0-cal Matteo's Thin Pumpkin Spice coffee syrup. Because I'm running low on dietary fat today. Oh my God, the 3.6% Siggi's is so creamy! 27.6g protein, 9.2g fat, 9.2g carbs, 230 calorie ""snack."" With macros like that, that's a meal right there. And if you add low density fruits like strawberries and pineapple chunks in the yogurt bowl, you can fill yourself up and satisfy your sweet tooth for not a lot of calories. Normally I don't like going high fat on yogurt, milk, processed cheese slices, cream cheese, etc. and usually pick the reduced fat or fat-free options when available. But I absolutely devoured this thing. 

I'm going to have to get plain Greek Yogurt when I start running low on Skyr and try the 0-cal syrups with this. Because I've always hated plain Greek Yogurt and would use whey protein powder frequently. But then I hated plain/vanilla skyr too until I tried putting cocoa powder and 0-cal maple flavoured syrup in it to neutralize the sour taste. Then I started experimenting with using powdered peanut butter and coffee syrups in skyr. However Greek Yogurt is more sour than Skyr so I've yet to find out.

I used to go through a 6lb tub of whey protein blend in like less than 2 months. Granted I've lost weight so my protein intake needs aren't as high as they used to be. But now I never make whey protein shakes anymore. Because whey protein shakes don't leave me as full as eating protein yogurt with fruit. Here in Canada, whey protein blend and I think isolate is cheaper than Greek yogurt. And Skyr is more pricey when not on sale. That's the upside of whey and the downside of Skyr and to a lesser extent Greek Yogurt. Sometimes I like to mix flavored whey protein powder into my yogurt for fun. Or I use it to make a no-bake high-protein cocoa spread. 

I'm actually kinda sad that I rarely use my whey protein anymore because the birthday cake flavour one I have tastes awesome with 2%/3.25% m.f protein milk. It tastes like liquid crack with chocolate milk. And I have a 6lb tub of strawberry shortcake powder I bought in May that I still haven't touched yet. Luckily it doesn't expire until 2027. It just doesn't make any sense for me to be drinking calories though on a cut. And I need the carbs and the fats too. And when I start the bulk, it's going to be a lot easier to get my protein in so I won't need to be buying protein powder for a very long time. I might use my whey for baking/cooking in the future. But then I hear casein and whey-casein is way better for that because whey dries out. Whey is great for no-bake though. So as long as the flavour you're using fits. And you can always just buy unflavoured whey protein and flavour it however you want to.",1,1727889335.0,naturalbodybuilding,0,1.0,False

Fed up of eggs, and wish to take a break from chicken. I'll be needing roughly two scoops per day for at least one and a half month until I get my appetite for non veg back. Please help me with a few doubts

1. Is whey from flipkart, regardless of them using the official seller and open box, safe? In terms of repackaged whey. I have never bought whey from there, only twice from amazon. (nakpro, legit)
2. Each is trustified certified, but how are they in terms of performance? I've had Avvatar, GNC and MB when whey was my secondary source of protein - one scoop a day. Used nakpro platinum and gold, and atom as primary source - 2 scoops per day, and my gut suffered along with their taste being too synthetic - chocolate, coffee, vanilla.

I didn’t go to the doctor until late August. That was when I was put on omeprazole for one month. 

Let’s just say July and August and part of September was brutal. Belly burns everyday, nausea, anxiety. Crying on my living room floor praying and begging to be healed..

About two weeks before September was over I was starting to feel an improvement. Less belly burns, I started treating myself to banana nut bread at Starbucks once a week and that didn’t hurt my stomach. Please keep in mind I was on a bland diet for about 99 percent of the time. I ate bland chicken and mashed potatoes or salmon with mashed potatoes during my healing process.


My doctor told me that I can stop the ppi and that I will experience acid rebound but he said that should go away. He let me know that if my stomach goes completely back to how it was in late July, he would order an endoscopy.

I’ve almost been off of ppis for one week. So far, I’ve had acid rebound here and there not too crazy but I just had my first dose of slippery elm power. I’ll be drinking that everyday and going back to mostly bland diet. 

Question: so a family member had a work anniversary celebration and I had a combination bite size portions of two slices of squares cut pizza, spicy Korean chicken sandwich, one fry and two brownies. I stayed away from alcohol at the event and plus I’m not much of a drinker. While I was eating all of this I was thinking to myself. Well I’ll be in pain tomorrow hunched over the couch somewhere and luckily to my surprise my stomach doesn’t hurt however I’ll cool it down on eating what I want. 

Is this  slight sight of possibly healing? This time last month I was in the fetal position on the couch in pain because I ate ready made tuna out from the store….

As mentioned above.  I've had my machine for around 2 years now and have loved it.  Since the birth of our second child, my wife's tastes have changed and she now find the coffee too bitter.  I've descaled, changed the water filter, changed beans, changed ratios etc - but still to no avail.      
  
  
Frustratingly she will now have an almost daily purchase of a venti Starbucks 'cappuccino'.  I realize they have a 50K machine, but there has to be a way I can try and nearly replicate it.  I've purchased their beans - tried to match their ratios, however she still feels it's not sweet enough, too bitter etc. I even pulled a salami shot out of it to get her to taste them all with the flavors- no dice.    
  
  
Has anyone successfully found a recipe to try and approximate this?  Maybe it's just not possible with a home machine - but thought I'd give it a shot (ha).

Help?,"This is a little long, but I'm desperate for advice. I posted this in another community and literally not a single person responded so I'm hoping it's not me doing something wrong.

My boyfriend and I met through Tinder in June of 2023, and have been inseparable since. He does everything he can to take care of me. He pays for our groceries and other essentials/bills. He bought me a new car after someone hit me and totaled my old one. He moved me in with him after a year of dating so I can finish med school and not have to worry about anything financially, with the expectation that I cook and clean for him. He takes me on cute dates that he always insists on paying for. He gives me money for lunch and coffee for work. He doesn't put up a fight when I ask his to take off work so we can attend events together. He's vulnerable with me and he's so sweet, always worrying about me and my mental health before his. I love him so much. I have never been with a man who ***wants*** to provide for the home and myself the way he does. There's not a thing I wouldn't do for him.

Here's some background;

I was raised in a nontraditional home. My parents are that couple that should've been divorced but couldn't afford it, so they stayed together because it was easier. Which made our lives miserable more times than not. While they did the best they could, they were strict and overbearing. Invaded privacy, hit us, screamed and punished us more times than I can count. My mother was diagnosed bipolar and my father diagnosed with manic depression. My siblings and I are latchkey kids and, because I am the oldest, I practically raised them. My parents were abusive(mentally, verbally, physically)but were fighting so many mental and financial battles of their own at the time. We were poor, on government assistance, and living paycheck to paycheck. My boyfriend was raised similar but somewhat differently. His parents were married for a short period and then divorced. His dad was incredibly absent, was always in and out. He then died when my boyfriend was 13. His mother was practically a single mother for his entire life. His grandfather played a very big part in his life as his main male role model. Unfortunately, he died a few years ago, as well. Despite all of this, we both feel fortunate to be in the positions we currently are.

Here's where I need advice;

We both feel like we have abandonment issues and anxiety. I have insecurity issues, I was cheated on in my last relationship. I worry when we fight that he'll get fed up and just leave or someone else will come along and make him happier than I can. He worries that because I have become a huge part of his life, that I will walk out whenever I feel appropriate, like his dad. He is very quick to irritation when things don't go his way. When I mention that, he gets defensive and says that he's not. We are polar opposites during arguments. I want to walk away and calm myself down in order to have a real conversation, or just rot in bed until I feel better. He wants to immediately talk about it, find a resolution, and get back to being happy with each other. He says he can tell when my mood shifts, even when I tell him nothing is wrong. He also says that I shut him out and get sucked into my phone. I must not notice this, I had no idea this even happened until he brought it up. Other times we argue because I feel like the effort I put in around the house goes unnoticed. When I mention it, we argue because he thinks that I don't notice the effort he puts in for us outside of the home. He has started a company with his best friends and spends a lot of his free time focused on that. And while I feel like I am trying to be patient and supportive, it's hard when we can find a solution to our issues. Eventually, we just end up in a weird mood for the rest of the night because neither of us knows how to shift and move on.

I hope this was enough information. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to give up on us. I just need advice on what we're doing wrong. I want to spend the rest of my life with him but I can't if we never learn how to resolve our issues. TIA!",1,1727888837.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1ful9hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1ful9hp/sobbing_on_the_way_home_from_the_doctor/,sobbing on the way home from the doctor,"I'm so tired of having to convince my doctor that what I'm feeling is a true physical symptom and not depression, not just in my head, not worth dismissing because the cause isn't immediately obvious. 

Today I had my physical, but also wanted to discuss this 2-week bout of extreme fatigue I had had a couple weeks ago. It started abruptly and ended abruptly. I had written out a timeline with when symptoms started and ended, where my menstrual cycle fit into it, when I started taking new vitamins, when I went on trips, and also key events regarding mold we found in our house and had remediated. I thought any of these could be related, and I felt compelled to write it all out ahead of time because I KNEW that she would just dismiss it.

I have hypothyroidism, it was coincidentally tested in the midst of this (already scheduled) and TSH came back just barely above the upper limit, but she wrote that ""we'll talk about this at your physical"" so I didn't message back. 

I started to tell her about the symptoms I had (brain fog, couldn't focus, couldn't exercise, really just debilitating fatigue that I've NEVER felt before) -- ""sounds like depression."" ""Yes I know, it sounds like the physical effects of depression, but everything was fine, i didn't have anything mentally or emotionally going on."" ""Well it could be depression."" ""Okay but it's NOT depression, here's some things it could be--"" ""Sometimes not feeling motivated is from depression.""

And of course, as soon as I felt like here we go, I need to literally ARGUE with my doctor to get her to listen to me, of course I started crying. She said ""You're crying? And you're sure it's not depression."" and I finally snapped and said ""No I'm crying because I knew this was gonna happen, I knew you were gonna say this was just in my head.""

Some other parts of our discussion: It could be the thyroid, but then it doesn't make sense that I've lost weight, but I've been doing that on purpose just through a calorie deficit, but if my thyroid was high I physically wouldn't be able to lose weight. I should have told her about the fatigue when we got the TSH result back, but also it was just borderline so it couldn't be affecting me that much. It could be my hormones, but she can't help me with that, I need to see a GYN -- I DID see a GYN about it in February when I first noticed my PMS symptoms were getting worse, and he told me there was nothing he could do about it except put me on more birth control (I already have a hormonal IUD). Were you hydrating? Of fucking course I was hydrating. Maybe you need SSRIs. IT'S NOT DEPRESSION.

And all of this was only after I was crying, after she was ready to just chalk it up to... what? A hallucination?

Basically, I was probably just sad for a couple of weeks, that's why I couldn't focus, not because of DEBILITATING PHYSICAL FATIGUE. I literally thought we had accidentally gotten decaf coffee, because it felt like I had caffeine withdrawals. I can't overstate just how physical this feeling was, not emotional.

Once I got out to my car I just sobbed, drove probably a quarter mile, sobbed some more.

Enough's enough with this doctor. This isn't the first, second or third time I've experienced this with her, that's why I felt the need to make the timeline to begin with, to arm myself with some evidence.

1ful9en,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThornTree/comments/1ful9en/a_river_journey_in_cambodia/,A River Journey in Cambodia.,"Mr Pen was a scraggly, bare chested, leathery faced old man who wore a lopsided grin on account of the permanent cigarette that hung mostly unlit from the corner of his mouth. We neither spoke the other's language, but with a little mime and dance I was able to convey my wish to travel with him up river, and after a little finger numbering we agreed on the five dollar fee for the two day trip. Mr Pen had already released his cargo in Phnom Penh and was returning to Siem Reap without a back load meaning there was plenty room for me and my hammock. We’d be leaving immediately.



Phnom Penh’s riverside dock was as dusty and chaotic as I’d hoped. Bouncing wooden planks jutted from decks to the shore as ten or twelve cargo boats unloaded their freight onto land for the waiting trucks and carts. I was impressed at the speed and assuredness of the swarms of bare-foot laborers as they navigated the thin wooden pathways carrying immense loads of bricks, lumber and even toilets on their heads, the planks bowing deeply under their weight. I wondered how often workers fell into the river.



My first attempt at navigating the thin wooden pathway to Mr Pen’s boat saw my foot slip off one side of the plank sending me plunging legs splayed onto the timber below, the resulting grazes on the inside of my thighs reminding me for days of the agility, fine balance, and sure footedness of the men who humped their loads. It should also be mentioned here the universal hilarity of a man getting it in the balls - more than a few Cambodian laborers doubled up in laughter for a little too long at my expense. 



I've put my hammock in some places over the years, but being surrounded by the smoothly worn wood of an old cavernous Cambodian cargo boat nears the top of the list. The entire top deck was empty and I had it to myself, the perfect place to sling my hammock and watch the languid scenes of rural Cambodian river life slide by as we made our way slowly to Siem Reap. Watching the children splas around on the river’s edge, cows grazing lazily on the banks, fishermen repairing nets, women attending to their daily laundry, wildlife, and the lush greenery of it all was the perfect backdrop to the muffled ""pop"" of Mr Pen's diesel engine as we made our way slowly north up river. 



Approaching nightfall Mr Pen pulled his boat toward the bank, stopped the engine and moored our home to a couple of trees. The wiry old man walked past and gestured for me to follow him below toward the rear of the boat where we found a woman, presumably his wife, cooking over a small stove. 



Mr Pen motioned for me to sit on the floor and I was given a dish of plain rice topped with two small dried fish and an egg. Eating dried fish never gets any easier for me and it takes a big glob of rice to surround each piece so as to swallow it whole, avoiding the crunchiness of fish head and the unappealing texture of the animal’s internal organs. 



Our dining room sat directly above the engine bay next to a drum of fuel, the heavy smell of diesel helping divert my attention from the dried week-old dry fish. Mr and Mrs Pen sat in silence as we ate offering a small smile and a nod of their heads when I'd finished. Mr Pen finished his food then replaced the soggy cigarette hanging at the corner of his mouth with a dry one.



The night was still and perfect in my hammock with only the occasional rustle of leaves from the river's bank as a bird adjusted its perch. My position remained unchanged through the night and I slept in peace, a welcome relief from the endless commotion of the nights in Phnom Penh.



Watching the river slowly come to life as night became day through purple hues of morning is a lovely way to wake up. I'd brought some coffee, sugar and a cup with me and asked Mrs Pen for some hot water which she readily provided. It would be a ten hour push up river to Siem Reap today and I’d spend it drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, enjoying the quiet solitude this type of travel offers.



After a few hours the banks of the Tonle Sap began to change with kids and cows being replaced by dwellings, restaurants and shops poking out onto the water. It now seemed people were more intent on going somewhere or doing something than those of the previous day or two. Sadly, it seemed in a few hours my little cargo boat adventure would be coming to an end.



With the help of a man on the shore, a plank was laid out from our boat's bow to the river's bank and with a hand shake I thanked Mr Pen for the ride. My inner thighs were still tender against my shorts from my first attempt at walking the plank the day before, reminding me to take things carefully as I bounced toward the shore.



I’ve put my hammock in some places over the years, but few come close to Mr Pen’s cargo boat.

I am a 21 year old female. I live with my parents. I am in my 4th year of university (I do online classes) and work part time on the weekends:  Friday-Sunday. 
I met my current boyfriend at work. He is black. We have been dating for a year now. My parents have known about him for a while before we were even dating because of my friend group. They were suspicious about him because we were always hanging out. They do not want me dating a black person. So anytime they would question me I would tell them “there is nothing going on” because if they knew I was dating a black guy, the world would end. 
Finally I decided to just tell my mom he’s my boyfriend. I honestly thought she wouldn’t freak out because she has said so many times how much she loves him and he’s so respectful and kind. But oh no did I think wrong. She’s literally having a heart attack and crying saying how I ruin their lives and I better break up with him or she’s going to tell my dad. 
Obviously I didn’t break up with him. Fast forward about a month: Me and my boyfriend were going on vacation: so a few days before the vacation I told my dad that he is my bf, over text because I was scared to do it in person. He was a lot more calm and level headed than my mom at the time. 

Anyways we went on vacation. Then me and him have gone on vacation again 2 more times after that with his family. BEAUTIFUL ONCE INA LIFE TIME  EXPERIENCES. 

Obviously I was away across the country for multiple days ina row. Sleeping, staying the night. 
I live 8 minutes from my boyfriend. He works full time, doesn’t get out of work till 6pm. He does school, gym, cooks, cleans, takes care of his parents etc. My parents refuse to let me sleep over his house. I truly do not understand why when they have allowed me go on 3 vacations since I told them he is my bf. Where I was gone for almost a week at a time. 
The other part that confuses me is: I had a previous bf before my current one. He lived an hour away from me. He was white, COVERED in tattoos. 6 giant FACE tattoos, use to pray to the devil, been in jail, so much mental health issues. He inherited 1 million dollars from his dad. He was crazy and so evil to me. But my parents would let me sleep over his house for a good 3 days in a row.

I just do not get it. How would u let me sleep over somewhere an hour away for days but I can’t sleep over at my current boyfriend’s house that is 8 minutes away? I know it’s because he is black. He comes from a great family and is highly educated. All my parents do is talk bad about him and how he works at Walmart and I need to find a better guy to be with and I should be w someone from my university. My boyfriend only works at Walmart because Walmart is paying for his university education! 
Anyways I’m at my boyfriend’s house a few times a week. I usually leave his house around 2-4am because my parents won’t let me sleep over there. 
They tell me disrupt their sleep if I come home past 2am because the ring door bell notification on my mom’s phone wakes them up. They now want me to be home at 2am. Mind you, my boyfriend gets done work at 6pm.  He comes home, then is at the gym from like 7-9pm sometimes 10pm, has to shower, maybe play a few games w his friends on the PlayStation to relax, make food for his parents+ me, walk the dogs, etc. I basically have no time to spend with him in my opinion.
I have tried to give my mom options about the ring doorbell so it doesn’t wake her up. But all she says is “no! No! No!” 
And when I have tried to explain to her how my bf has a life outside of me, her response is “well clearly he puts u second, and doesn’t care to spend time with you, if I was him and had a girlfriend I would spend all my time w her. ” Like seriously?!? He has responsibilities and I would never make him not do them to spend time w me. It just so annoying that I feel like I’m on a time scrunch when I’m hanging w him. 

Last week me and him went out for my friend’s party. I was out since 8pm and I didn’t get back to his house till almost 3 am. I still wanted me and him to have our alone time, I wanted to take my makeup off, etc. it was past 3am at this point, if I came home, I would have gotten bitched at that I woke her up and she couldn’t fall back asleep, so I decided to come home at 6:45am when she gets up for work. And guess what, that was a problem too. In her eyes, I should have gotten in my car as soon as I got to his place and went home.
I just do not understand her logic on why I cannot sleep over his house. Another thing she says is “that’s how u get pregnant” like honey, I can get pregnant anywhere,any place, anytime. Like me sleeping over his house does not mean that lol. I just want to cuddle and sleep for real and then I just want to have all the time I need to spend w him. 

She is just so controlling and wants to control every aspect of my life. I can’t stand it any more. All she does is throw in my face on how I was such a bad kid in highschool and put her through hell and I did so bad in school…. I graduated high school in 2021. I was an average kid. I got A’s,B’s, and C’s. I also was slacking becuase it was  Covid time, and it was so extremely hard for me to do school from home and being locked up in the house. When she says I put her through hell, I was a teenage girl that liked boys…. Now I can take responsibility for my actions as a teenager. I use to sneak out all the time and sneak my previous boyfriends my house. Yes I know that’s wrong but I was a kid!!!! I know that. I wouldn’t do that now. And considering I was doing that for years, I only got caught 2x. 

She just complains and complains about the past. Like what about now? I’m in university. I have a 3.7 GPA. I’m in honors…. But none of that matters to her it feels like. Nothing I do feels good enough for her. I know she obviously wants the best for me. 
I am not the only child either. I am the oldest and then have a little brother who is 17 years old. We are NOTHING alike. He is an actual prodigy. Golden child. Listens, never makes a mistake. Valedictorian. Shy, nerdy. 
My mom is obsessed with him. 

I told my parents I might want to become a dermatologist (this has nothing to do with my degree now) because I love skincare and makeup. And they were supportive. But then it’s like they aren’t going to help me pay for school.  Now, I pay for my school myself right now for the past 4 years. My dad made a deal with me my first year saying if I got an 89 average or higher he would reimburse me a year’s worth of tuition. I had 93+ average. So yes I got a ton of money back.

But they are about to pay for my brother’s school if he gets into Princeton. They are going to pay 50% for him. But not me if I choose to go into dermatology? It’s so clear the favoritism. 

Then once again I get it throw into my face how I shoulda done better in Highschool and I was a terrible kid. And then it goes back to how they don’t approve of my black boyfriend and how they honestly just want to throw me out the house because of it. And how I’m an embarrassment of the family for having a black boyfriend. 

My brother just turned 17 in August so my dad got him a car for his bday. I asked my dad “is he going to pay for his car” and my dad said “no, he will eventually”. Omg I started crying because I got my car at 17 and I have had to pay for my car insurance and car payment (my dad pays for my gas). But my bother doesn’t have to? It so unfair… my dad could see that I was really upset about that and then told me he will pay for my car payment for me. But now it’s  literally been a month and I’m already getting that thrown in my face. My dad the other day told me if I go to my boyfriend’s house and I’m not back around 2am I’m going to have to start paying for my car payment again. Like OK… I been doing that anyways for years. 

My mom also tells me that I need to work more since I have “so much free time” to be at my bfs house. She’s telling me to go into work on the days I’m free... I use to be able to do that, and I would go in. But my manger said we can’t do that anymore because she gets in-trouble. I only work Friday-Sunday. Sometimes I just get lucky that I get  all my school work done early. I want my free time to relax as well. But that’s a problem.

I constantly get into fights w my mom. It’s always been like this but I feel like it goes through phases where everything is great and fine and then it just explodes. 

She freaks out on me and then threatens to stop doing stocks for me, and she going to start charging 20% from me etc. It all goes back to money and how much money she has helped me get through a law suit and unemployment from Covid and blah blah blah. I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF MY MONEY. SHE DOES. I do not have access to a single thing. Not even on my debit card. My debit card is not even connected to any bank account. My mom has to go cash out MY money for me when I need it and then I go and put that money on my debit card. When I have bills to pay, my mom is the one who transfers the money. I do not do any of that.  
Anytime we fight and she threatens my money, I tell her I’ll go to the cops and her responds is “it’s under my name” or “it’s a joint account, so they can’t do anything” she says one of those things. I don’t remember exactly. 

I need you to understand the type of person she is so please continue to read:

I have been trying to learn how to cook and make new things every week. I just started this 2 weeks ago. I want to start cooking for my bf especially because he is literally a chef (it’s one of his passions and love languages) so I want to learn for him. 
 2 days ago I come downstairs to heat up a burger that my mom made and I’m looking in the fridge to see if my mom got all the ingredients for me to make Tuscan pasta. 
I said “did u get minced garlic” and she has this wild attitude like so extremely rude and is like “I DONT USE MINCED GARLIC I USE FRESH” Im like “oh I asked u to put that on the grocery list… where is it?” and she started screaming at me that she uses real garlic and blends it up and for me to go find it. SCREAMING AT ME. I’m like omg I just asked u a question. I only wanted to know where it was so I knew where everything was so I could be prepared to cook it the next day. My mom is literally losing her mind.  Now I’m getting really mad because I asked her a simple question. So as I’m heating up my food, I mumble “fucking bitch no one likes u”  I’m surprised she heard me honestly. I know I shouldn’t have said that but I’ve had it the way she treats me. She starts screaming at me, gets up off the couch, snatches my burger from me and tells me not to touch her food and for me to go starve, punches me in the back and tells me shes gonna kill me. I started yelling back and then I went upstairs in my room and left to go to my bfs house and I stayed the whole night and didn’t come back home till 10am. 

She has given me the silent treatment for the past two days. Literally has not talked to me, if we are in the same vicinity it’s like I’m not there.  She loves to do this to me but I do not care. 

My dad witnesses the whole thing and didn’t say a word. If he doesn’t agree w anything my mom says she freaks out on him and they fight. So I know I was right before I mumbled underneath my breath because my dad woulda said something to me.  

Another incident was back in 2019 I believe. I had to be 16 I was a sophomore in highschool. I came home from school and took a nap, I woke up maybe around 6-7pm and got a terrible stomach bug OUT OF NO WHERE. I was throwing up for HOURSSS. it was coffee grinds. I thought I was going to die. I end up going downstairs and start throwing up in the downstairs toilet. Instead of my mom helping me, she takes out her phone and starts videoing me throwing up and is like “I’m recording you how u video everyone all the time in this house” ( I was a teenager w a phone, Snapchat user and would take pics and videos of my family and save them to my Snapchat memories).  Im literally dying and she has the nerve to start videoing me?! Clearly I have a problem with cursing because I called her a bitch for that. And she lost her mind once again and starts freaking out on me and comes all the way upstairs in my room and starts trashing it throwing around everything. (I took a video of this) and then FRONT KICKS ME IN THE STOMACH. WHILE IM LITERALLY DYING of the stomach virus. im balling my eyes out, throwing up from being sick, omg it was the worst. She told me she was trying to kick me in my bad knee (my knee dislocates.. I need surgery on it) and not in my stomach. Finally hours later once she realized that I was seriously ill, she then tried to help me and take care of me.

Another incident: in 2021 I got my license and I rear ended someone that year. I was so sad because it was obviously my fault. I was trying to switch into another lane and was looking in my mirror but the guy in front of me stopped to turn left. It was a minor accident, nothing crazy. When I came home my mom is freaking out on me and telling me I CRASHED MY CAR BECAUSE I FELL ASLEEP WITH MY LIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE!!! How does that even make any sense?!?? She’s screaming saying that because I fell asleep w my light on I didn’t get a good enough sleep and wasn’t focused when I was driving and that cause me to crash…. 

Another incident: Last month my grandma came over. My mom’s mom. she stayed for almost a month. My mom got her some snacks. I came home from work and saw the cookies in the pantry. So I grabbed the box and I GRABBED 1 cookie ( I wanted 2). My mom SNATECHED THE BOX FROM ME and with mad attitude was like “ur not eating these, these aren’t yours, u didn’t pay for them, these are ur grandmas” My grandma saw this and she was SPEACHLESS. My grandma tried to tell my mom how she was so wrong for that…

And while my grandma was here we had talks about my mom and she has even said how rude and controlling she is, and she felt like she was walking on eggshells the whole time she was here. 

Another incident: it was my brothers birthday in 2020. He was probably turning 13 or something. My mom wanted to take pictures of him to post on Facebook and he didn’t want to take pictures. My mom started losing her mind once again and started screaming at him and she’s balling her eyes out screaming and crying about how terrible he is and how she does everything around here and he can’t take a simple picture to make her happy. ( I took a video of this too) it was absolutely insane. She’s crying saying how he ruined the day and every single day she can’t be happy. She was losing her mind over a picture. 

Another: I use dove soap to wash my face. I wear a lot of makeup. So I’ll wash my face 3x at night to make sure it’s all off. She gets mad that my bar of dove soap doesn’t last long. Let’s keep in mind who uses my bathroom: my brother uses the soap morning and night to wash his face. I use it in the morning 1 time to wash my face and then 3x at night. She tells me that I’m wasting the soap because she ASSUMES I take the bar of soap and rinse it underneath the water to make it bubbly which is dissolving it. I don’t even do that. I get my hands wet first and then rub the soap together in my hands. And she assumes this because there are BUBBLES ON THE BAR OF SOAP!!!!! And she gets mad that my soap runs out way faster than hers…. She’s not washing my face as much as I do. And why are you getting mad there are bubbles on soap?!? I literally will make sure there aren’t any bubbles on the soap when I use it so I don’t have to deal with a fight. 

Another: When I was a child maybe 8-9 years old I was in swimming lessons and I was so scared to jump in the deep end of the pool. Everyone else in my class could do it except me. I was so scared. And anytime after class that I couldn’t do it my mom would freak out and yell at me that I’m so embarrassing. It then got to the point she would drive me to some random abandoned house in the middle of the night after swimming class was over and would tell me if I didn’t jump in the pool she would drop me off at “the foster people houses”. Like wtf. And she would do that all time if me or my brother didn’t listen to her. 
I remember the day before I had swimming class one day, I called up my aunt (her sister) and was crying saying how scared I was that if I didn’t jump in the pool I was going into foster care. I WAS A CHILD. 

She has 2 other sisters (my aunts). One lives in Canada and another one Texas. And I use to be really close to my aunt in canada and would tell her all the crazy stuff that was happening. Both her sisters literally cut her off in 2020 and have not spoken to her because of how crazy she has become and how bad she treats me. 

My mom has no problem treating me how she treats me and has no care in the world trying to understand me or hear me out. Like I do not know what to do. Every simple conversation turns into a fight. If she is rude to me, I cannot sit there and take it i will stand up for myself. But then im seen as a disrespectful daughter. Am I rlly such a terrible child and deserve all of this? Once again I have no problem admitting to when I’m wrong but I’m tired of her throwing the past in my face when I was an average teenager doing normal teenager things. Point is I’m way better  now and am a completely different person and have grown so much since then. Now the big scandal is me having a black boyfriend and staying over there all the time.

Most people occasionally have trouble sleeping. Me, personally... I think my lifelong problem with sleeping has severely impacted my life, ruined many occasions requiring me to wake up with a clear head, and will likely take its toll in the form of shortening my lifespan (though I try not to think about that too much, especially while I'm laying awake in bed trying to sleep hehe).

I'm sitting here midday with this familiar hoarse, dry, groggy feeling that I have come to know all my 30+ years of life. I know there's no use of having a nap as sleep will not come. On the rare occasion I do manage a nap (usually biannually), I wake up feeling like I'm in the twilight zone and it will ruin my sleep later on.

I wouldn't call it insomnia but rather delayed sleep onset. Perhaps it's a form of insomnia? It's a problem with sleep that amounts to me going without much sleep.

Everyone is tired, all the time. Being tired is not a pissing contest, and it's miserable listening to complaining. I usually do okay on very little sleep, but sometimes I'm just so underslept that I feel off/awkward/STUPID/NOT myself. When it gets extreme like that I desperately want to explain why I'm so forgetful, spaced out, just plain weird. When you tell someone you haven't been sleeping this week or you only got 2 hours of sleep or something it's a common reaction for them to share some tips on how to sleep. It comes from a caring place, but I've been well-schooled in sleep hygiene. **I HIGHLY recommend ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker, PhD.** Some things I've learned over the years:

* Go to bed and wake up at the same time, even on weekends 
* The importance of using sunlight and forward-self-propelled movement in the sunlight to regulate our circadian rhythm
* We cycle in and out of light/deep ""REM"" sleep throughout the night, and it's normal to wake up once in the ""middle of the night"" (especially as we age)
* Have a wind-down self-care routine 
* Blackout/cold temperature room after a warm shower 
* Bedroom is for sleeping only 
* No screens 2 hours before bedtime
* Avoid caffeine (coffee and other hidden sources), especially 8-10 hours before you plan your sleep 
* Meditation/relaxation exercises that army marines use to fall asleep (box breathing, tense/release exercises, etc) 
* Practice meditation 
* Make sure you are getting enough activity but do not exercise in the evening 
* Don't eat something heavy before bed but sometimes a little carb-rich snack helps 
* Sometimes it's best to just get up and do something boring, then try laying down to sleep after
* Chamomile, valerian root, passion flower, California poppy, sleepy time tea with the bear on it, magnesium, melatonin, and other aids, though be careful not to become dependent on any one of them or suffer rebound insomnia 
* Sleeping pills do not allow for a restful/restorative sleep, therefore they are pointless, potentially harmful, and I have never asked for them despite my lifelong trouble sleeping (any doctor I've had always agrees when I decline). It was recommended 
* ""*just don't think about anything, close your eyes and go to sleep*"" - this one I haven't been able to manage myself, but it's a tip I get from loads of people including my partner who falls asleep within minutes of trying

These things are hard to keep up 100% of the time, but I put in a good effort and abide by most. Yet here I am... fitbit says 4 hours and 1 minute of sleep after working a physically exhausting 12 hour shift and getting only 2 hours and 10 minutes the night before. I'm fucking exhausteeeeeed but it's cool. 

My mother says when I was a wee toddler she would put me in my crib to nap and hear me, awake, babbling to myself.

When I was a little girl I suffered having night terrors for years. They lasted for a long time, to the point where I was embarrassed to admit I was ""*afraid of the dark*"". I was exposed to some scary movies and games too early on due to having an older brother. I resented the sun as it began to set in the early evening. It would bring on a sense of dread and despair. Here we go again, every single night, laying awake in terror for hours and hours and hours.

Any kind of occasion that requires me to be on-the-ball early in the morning is tough (like my full time career lol). Exams are tough if they are in the morning. I have slept in and missed major events and appointents, even planned happy get together type things with friends that I have no anxiety over have historically been ruined by lack of sleep.

I have been diagnosed with a handful of mental health issues, least of all generalized anxiety disorder, and have been medicated on and off since I was 13. 

Something in my brain just doesn't work to allow me to sleep like a ""normal"" person. 

So, shout out to all my fellow zombie people, my night walkers, all my insomniacs out there. If any of this resonated with you just know you're not alone, and I'll be thinking about you before I fall asleep (so I'll be thinking about you for a good 2-3 hours)

","You can get $10,000 per year, for life, tax free. Nice, but not necessarily life altering. Or you can get a butler. The butler is British, mid forties, and doesn’t age. His name would be Reginald or Jeeves, or something similar. While on duty he would wear a tuxedo. 

He would sleep on a rollaway bed that must be stored in a closet in your home. If you have an extra room for him, he would be grateful, but it is not necessary. He would be on duty from the time you wake up, to the time you go to bed. 

The butler would work 6 days a week, and would get two weeks of vacation. He does not work on Sundays. On that day, he will attend an Episcopalian or Lutheran church if one is available within 20 miles. He has a bicycle, and does not drive. He would also do his shopping, and occasionally visit a prostitute on his day off, if available. He is very discreet. 

He will do his duties, but he is not a slave:

He will tidy up your home, keep things orderly, but he is not a maid, and will not do cleaning, like floors, windows, dishes, etc. 

He will serve and plate your meals, and can prepare simple sandwiches and cold hors d’oeuvres. He is not a chef, and cannot cook, but he will put something in an oven at a designated temperature for a designated time. If it burns he will not know. He will not use the microwave or stove. 

He can make and serve drinks. He has a good knowledge of wine and cocktails, though of course you must provide the ingredients. He makes okay coffee, but very good tea. 

He will answer your door, and your phone if required. He will keep your personal calendar and appointments, but nothing involving your business. He will not pay your bills, but will remind you when they are due. 

He will not wash, dry, or fold clothes, but will iron clothes and hang them up. He can help you pick clothes and dress. He has superb knowledge of style for formal and business wear, but knows nothing of modern casual clothing. 

He will take your dog out, and feed your animals, but does not clean up after them. He is not a nanny, and will not watch your kids, but if he sees them making trouble, he may tsk at them. 

He will not do any home repair or improvements, nor any outdoor work. He will not run errands for you. 

If you ask him to do anything beyond the scope of his traditional butler duties, he will politely refuse. He cannot be paid or persuaded to do anything additional. 

When home, he will always be in the room or the next room, unless asleep. He will listen to you talk, but believes it is improper to truly converse with you, beyond polite chit chat. If you tell him a joke he finds truly funny, he may smile and say, “very good sir.” If he disapproves of your behavior, he won’t say anything, but he will have a disapproving look. 

He is fully paid by the Hypothetical Situation Council, and buys his own food, clothing, toiletries, etc. He will be with you until you die, and cannot be dismissed. If you call the police to have him trespassed from your home, they will think it’s a prank.",1,1727888262.0,hypotheticalsituation,13,0.67,False

I'm pretty new to the espresso making world (although I have been enjoying espresso-related drinks for many years now, particularly cappuccinos, lattes, and Americanos). However, I do own a vintage Chemex (the one with the thicker glass) and have been grinding my own beans with my 1Zpresso JX-Pro grinder to make coffee with my Chemex for a while now. I also understand the concept of brew temperatures, brew times, grind size, brew ratios, adjusting coffee and water quantity to match, measuring the end result with a scale, and following a step-by-step process (and adjusting as needed) to get to the target goal when it comes to making coffee. I personally enjoy my coffee black about 90% of the time, but do enjoy it with milk/cream occasionally (usually I'll order a cappuccino or latte instead however).

**Ok, now story time:**

After my first ever trip to Germany this summer, I learned about a completely new-to-me coffee drink that seems to be a regular in this country called the ""Cafe Crema"". Most cafes I went into (and including the self-serve machine in my hotels), whenever you wanted to order their standard larger-sized ""Coffee"" per say (not specifically an espresso or espresso-based drink), they all seem to provide a Cafe Crema instead (as we understand the big traditional coffees back in the USA are mostly an American idea, and I did know that up ahead before coming here and was totally ok).

In comparison to the regular espressos I had before, where I felt they were a bit too small for me (I do particular enjoy sitting and sipping on my drink for a while - especially with dessert) and some espressos I felt being overly bitter too (due to the very compressed nature of the small drinks vs regular Coffee), I absolutely fell in love with the overall volume and flavor profile of these Cafe Cremas (my girlfriend especially enjoyed them, and she was not a fan of espressos at all prior to this, only traditional coffee commonly with milk/cream and the occasional latte/cappuccino).

After deciding to research about what exactly a ""Cafe Crema"" is, I came to find out that this happens to be a drink originating around the Germany/Switzerland region and it is essentially is a traditional coffee-sized drink (ranging anywhere from 5oz-8oz depending who makes it), but the main difference is that it is in fact brewed entirely like an espresso and using an espresso machine instead of a regular coffee machine.

Remembering the Americanos I had before (and still seeing it being offered as an alternative on the menus next to Cafe Crema) I came to find out that, unlike Americanos, Cafe Cremas do not actually add hot water before or after the espresso drink is brewed, but is entirely brewed to that larger volume using the same espresso method (only adjusting dose and grind size to be more course to allow more water to flow in the same period of time as an espresso would be made). This, in turn, creates a super-unique flavor profile that we found very enjoyable and much much more interesting than any traditional coffee we had before (especially liked seeing the small layer of espresso crema on top) but still not as compressed of a flavor and smaller size as a standard espresso.

The hotel (where we frequently enjoyed our morning Cafe Crema) specifically used a Super Automatic machine (as I came to understand that is what they are called, when you select the drink you want using the touch screen, then it grinds the beans in it freshly, and does the entire espresso process automatically into your cup. It's possible some of the cafes use those machines as well but we did not notice at the time.

After we came back from our trip and started having our regular coffees again, we realized how much we truly missed those Cafe Cremas and (seeing as how they aren't served in any cafes around here - we searched around for a while) we decided that we would like to figure out how we can recreate those same drinks at home instead.

**The Goal:**

After some basic research, we came to understand that, even though our goal is not to make espressos (in particular) but Cafe Cremas instead, since Cafe Cremas are in fact espresso-based drinks, we would still have to learn about the espresso making process and get an espresso machine eventually.

Furthering on that research, we decided that if we have get an espresso machine anyways, we would highly prefer to avoid a Super Automatic (due their cost, size, them including a grinder that we don't need) and would prefer to see if we can recreate the same drink using a Semi-Automatic espresso machine instead. We felt that the manual steps for espresso-making were very interesting to us, and for the frequency we would be making them, we would really enjoy that same process.

During my research on the actual machines, for the price range that we are looking for (under $650), I came to understand that (if you don't want to modify anything), the Breville Bambino Plus is pretty much the best semi-auto espresso machine you can get (even among advanced users), for this price range that is (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong however).

**Ok, now on to the specifics of the drink and brewing process:**

After the (expected) super extensive research into the entire espresso making process (and figuring out how it differs from regular coffee-making), I understood that one of the most important factors that distinguishes the type of drink you're trying to make from another one (ie. ristretto, espresso, lungo, cafe crema, etc...) is the brew ratio of coffee to water (or coffee-in to drink-out) and adjusting the dose and/or grind size accordingly to hit that ratio.

While the exact ratios are slightly adjustable, I understood these drinks as follows

* **Ristretto** - generally **1:1**
* **Espresso** - generally **1:2**
* **Lungo** - anywhere from **1:3** to **1:4**
* **Cafe Crema** - **???**
* **Drip Coffee** - anywhere from **1:15** to **1:18**

Now since my goal is to make a Cafe Crema specifically, in my research about them and trying to figure out what should be the expected brew ratio, I came to understand that there doesn't appear to be any actual universally agreed-upon (or at least reasonable range of) brew ratio to make that drink. I've seen brew ratio recommendations anywhere from 1:3 (which I thought were lungos?) all the way up to some accepting even 1:14 (considering how close this is to drip coffee this just HAS to be way too thin and may produce almost no crema then right?).

Figuring I am trying to target the German-specific way of making them, I stumbled upon one very nice German video here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_tOLDcrJR18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tOLDcrJR18) (you can enable Closed Captions with auto-translate to English to understand what is being said, it's not a perfect translation but you definitely get the idea). In this video he shows 3 different ways (ratios) of making the Cafe Crema, with one example of a brew ratio of 1:13, another with 1:5, and the final one (where if you don't want to change the grind size from espresso grind) to use a ratio of 1:12 instead. Considering my default using this machine would be to make only Cafe Cremas, I am totally ok to adjust the grind size a little courser (so I chose to ignore the result of the 3rd ratio so it can be more ideal for this exact drink). However looking at the results of the first two ratios, I felt the 1:13 ratio looked a little slightly too thin/light on the crema than what I remember having in Germany throughout my travels, and the 1:5 was way too thick with way too much crema and essentially resembled a lungo instead (while I do like them, that is not the goal in this case).

**The Question At Hand:**

Considering the brew ratio range of Cafe Cremas provided in all my research is so vast, while I do understand a lot of it has to do with personal preference, I'm wondering if anyone on here may be able to provide any more insight or guidance on what in reality should be a more reasonable brew ratio range here to try to target for specifically Cafe Cremas. The most common recommendations I saw earlier were things like 1:7, 1:8, 1:10, and even 1:12. Considering how I felt about the results of the video, these more middle-ground ratios do make a little more sense to me, but the difference in resulting drink between them should still be quite large and it would much more helpful to see if we can get a range that's more narrow to what is most common (or what is common across Germany if possible).

Also any additional tips and recommendations (either for the machine we're looking at, or the brew process on it if we're trying to do Cafe Cremas, etc...) would also be most helpful.

**Some additional notes:**

Among my research, for specifically making Cafe Cremas in a semi-auto machine, I also saw recommendations for potentially getting a larger triple-shot basket (IMS was recommended - [https://www.amazon.com/Precision-compatible-Breville-Espresso-BES810BSS/dp/B0922Z67KK](https://www.amazon.com/Precision-compatible-Breville-Espresso-BES810BSS/dp/B0922Z67KK) ) and a bottomless portafilter instead (Crema brand was recommended - [https://www.amazon.com/Bottomless-Portafilter-Included-Breville-Machines/dp/B098Q9QF26/](https://www.amazon.com/Bottomless-Portafilter-Included-Breville-Machines/dp/B098Q9QF26/) - or simply removing the plastic bottom from the Bambino's stock PF instead). Some folks mentioned the larger basket helped them dial-in a larger dose (19-20g?) for the larger end-result drink (6-8oz?). Would you guys also recommend this or the stock Bambino Plus baskets should be enough and to dose it closer in its range?

***TLDR***

Girlfriend and I traveled to Germany this year, discovered Cafe Crema and fell it love with it. Wanting to recreate it back home, we decided to get into espresso making. Already have a 1Zpresso JX-Pro grinder. Discovered most recommended sub-$650 semi-auto espresso machine (without modding) is the Breville Bambino Plus. Extensive espresso-making research was done and got the general idea. Trying to figure out the brew ratio specifically for Cafe Crema (if possible specific to the way it's most common in Germany). Any additional tips on the exact machine we're looking at, brew process for Cafe Crema, tips/tricks, etc... would be appreciated.",1,1727888243.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1ful3s7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ful3s7,GlenAllachie Distillery - The Connoisseur Tour,"After our morning at Glenlivet, we headed to GlenAllachie for The Connoisseurs Tour, a highlight of our first day in Speyside. After some reservation juggling in our itinerary we ended up being able to take The Connoisseur Tour instead of the originally planned Premium Experience, this tour is offered only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so we were lucky to fit it in. Our guide, Wee Karen, led a small group of just four, a couple from Germany, my wife and me. 

GlenAllachie is large and modern, a legacy from its Chivas Brothers days when most of its spirit was used for blends. But now, under the direction of Billy Walker, it's all about top-quality single malts.

We started in a cozy tasting room, trying White Heather 21 years, a whisky that Billy Walker enjoyed in his youth and later acquired as part of the distillery's purchase. We also sampled Meikle Tòir Original, hoping to snag the Turbo version, but it was sold out. A taste of their new make spirit added a unique touch to the tasting.

One unexpected twist: the distillery was temporarily halted because one of the stills had an accident. This allowed us a rare opportunity to see and touch the stills and equipment from the inside—a truly special experience for any whisky lover.

GlenAllachie’s commitment to cask quality is impressive. We explored their warehouse, filled with an array of casks: ex-bourbon, ex-rye from Koval, sherry (both Oloroso and PX), port, French oak, Château Mouton barrels, Sauternes, and even Japanese Mizunara oak, which Billy Walker often samples. We were also shown some casks from Caol Ila, highlighting the practice of keeping casks from other distilleries.Tequila casks were mentioned, I asked where they were from but they couldn't tell, so I jokingly said, certainly from Mexico.

During this trip, unlike last year in Islay, we noticed that most distilleries didn’t have cafes or restaurants, which isn't ideal when driving and the designated driver can't drink. Bars offer crisps, maybe some biscuits, and a few non-alcoholic drinks—some have coffee, others don’t.

The tasting was excellent: 17-year Solera, Moscatel single cask (my wife’s favorite), PX single cask, an ex-peated cask at 62.5% ABV, and Lum Reek 21 peated blend. We stayed at the bar afterward, trying a couple more drams, including a Chinquapin-aged Meikle Tor and a 13-year distillery exclusive single cask at 60.9% ABV. Ultimately, we brought home the Moscatel and PX single casks, even filling our own bottles—a challenging task after so many high-proof drams!

GlenAllachie truly delivers an immersive and detailed tour, showcasing the craftsmanship and dedication behind their whiskies. For £60, it’s a must for any enthusiast!

1ful344,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularSupplements/comments/1ful344/a_journey_to_wellness_the_puravive_story/,A Journey to Wellness: The Puravive Story,"In a quiet suburban neighborhood in the heart of Texas, lived Emily, a 34-year-old single mother. Like many, she had long struggled with her weight, battling with diets that promised results but delivered little more than disappointment. Between her job and raising two energetic children, Emily felt like she was constantly juggling. She often found herself snacking late at night, reaching for sugary treats to combat her fatigue. Her dreams of fitting into her favorite jeans felt further away each day.

One evening, while scrolling through social media, Emily stumbled upon a glowing review of Puravive, a weight loss supplement that claimed to help optimize Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) levels—a concept she had never heard of. Intrigued, she clicked through to read more. The testimonials from satisfied users painted a picture of renewed energy and significant weight loss. She learned that BAT, often misunderstood as mere fat, was actually a powerful calorie-burning agent packed with mitochondria.

Feeling skeptical but hopeful, Emily decided to do more research. She discovered that Puravive was backed by scientific studies and formulated with eight natural ingredients, including Luteolin, Kudzu Root, and Holy Basil, which were chosen for their effectiveness in boosting BAT levels. The more she read, the more she felt that Puravive could be the key she had been searching for. It was FDA-approved, produced in a facility adhering to strict quality standards, and most importantly, it had a 180-day money-back guarantee.

[Puravive](https://preview.redd.it/16m7psr67asd1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e39836d087429bcda4fd278d6bbc9203b573118)

Encouraged by the positive feedback, including over 30,000 five-star reviews, Emily decided to take the plunge. She ordered her first bottle of Puravive, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. Would this be the solution she had been longing for?

A few weeks into her journey, Emily began to notice changes. The first week was challenging; she was used to quick fixes and immediate results. But Puravive worked subtly, helping her manage her cravings and keeping her energy levels steady throughout the day. She no longer felt the mid-afternoon slump that often led her to the vending machine for a sugary snack. Instead, she found herself engaging more with her kids after work, taking them on evening walks, and even cooking healthier meals together.

Her friend Sarah, a fitness enthusiast, noticed Emily's transformation and was curious about her secret. Over coffee one morning, Emily shared her experience with Puravive. Sarah was impressed but still hesitant, voicing her concerns about weight loss supplements. Emily reassured her, explaining that Puravive was not a magic pill but a supportive tool that worked best alongside a balanced diet and regular exercise.

As weeks turned into months, Emily not only lost weight but also gained a renewed sense of confidence. Her journey inspired others in her community. Sarah eventually decided to try Puravive as well, and soon the two friends were walking together regularly, sharing recipes and encouraging one another.

Emily's story resonated beyond her immediate circle. Through local community groups, she began sharing her experiences, urging others to embrace a holistic approach to health. She emphasized the importance of combining Puravive with a nutritious diet and active lifestyle.

Even her online presence grew. Emily started a blog to document her journey, sharing tips and recipes that had helped her along the way. She encouraged her readers to be cautious and to always purchase Puravive from the official website to avoid counterfeit products that could harm their health.

As the seasons changed, so did Emily. Her journey was about more than just weight loss; it was about reclaiming her life. The energy and confidence she gained not only transformed her body but also revitalized her spirit. Emily was no longer just a mother and employee; she was a woman on a mission to live her best life.

Her story of resilience and transformation inspired many in her community, proving that with the right tools and support, change is possible. And while Puravive played a significant role in her journey, it was Emily's commitment to herself and her health that truly made the difference. **To know further check PuraVive's official website:** [https://puravive.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Puravive.html)",1,1727888172.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

So far all I can see is:
1.) Every volunteer will more or less get called a 'volunteer' or a generically named name like Lead Volunteer, instead of a leader, which tbh will just confuse all parents as they won't know who does what as all the titles are the same or sound generic.

2.) They are changing their adult training record system, which as a volunteer,  I don't have anything to do with nor have ever logged on to in years as I can't see why many leaders need to look up the courses that they know they have done, and you can't enter your own courses.

3.) The online 'training' is more or less exactly the same, and as pointless and terrible as it always has been. Likely I'll just have to press play on a video whilst I make a coffee, or  do another test where I move some bits of screen about on a website and put bits of sentences together to make them grammatically correct for 15 mins to prove I'm safe to look after kids. 

4.) Apparently it'll be a 'team based' appoach now rather than whatever it was before. I can't quite see what this means and genuinely do not understand how this is different to the current set up, where surely people say what time they have and what they can and can't do, then either do what they have said or don't do what they said they will do.

Have I missed something, or is this the sum total of this transformation of the volunteering experience, as all I can see that will be actually different for me is I'll get called a Lead Volunteer instead of a Scout Leader?

# The Age of the Button

***Castle GreyWatch***

Snow fell on the North Tower. As it always did. Knight Commander Asde watched as moonlight danced on the falling crystals. Mage fire shimmered around his cloak, carving steam from the snow behind him. His focus shifted from the dancing light before him to the horizon. While it was not unusual for the Knight Commander to choose the darkest hours to man the Tower, this night he was looking for something specific. Something mentioned frequently of late in the dispatches from Redguard and from his own scouts from Purpopolis.

The ones who were able to return, at least.

He relaxed his eyes, shifting from ridgeline to horizon never focusing on any one thing too closely. He moved his gaze around and waited for his mind to catch what he was looking for. His instinct made him pause, and turn back to the North West. As soon as he saw what his mind said was there, it faded, as if a dark Pink lantern had been doused a fraction of a moment too late.

Panic and adrenaline flushed through his veins, but just for a moment. *Two days. It will have to be enough.*

The Pinkerium was coming.

------------------------------------------------------------

GreyWatch was empty, save for Asde. While the Wardens had been sent South to Blood Bay and Redguard, Shadows walked the battlements, theatre to dissuade any lingering Shades from taking advantage of the situation and springing his plan too soon. The Demons no longer tried to hide their advancement. Even at speed, he could see they were still half a day from his gates. His responsibility and charge. He had seen the dispatches from Purpopolis and Sotonne. The Grandmaster's orders to fall back to Redguard sat neatly in the pouch on his hip. Turning from the Tower battlement, he descended back into the warm, to his enchanting table, and returned to work. Sonorous chanting echoed through the empty corridors as he cast the same spells over and over, imbuing the already glowing stone before him with more and more layered enchantments and spells. Finally, when it shone so bright he could not even see it, he cast the last cantrip over it, and carefully enclosed it in his sturdiest rucksack, modified with two shoulder straps. He tied the laces, then knotted them again.

*Bloody hell, that was exhausting...* His eyes closed, he counted to ten, then ten again. Straightening up, he reached for one of the potions hanging from the stand. He remembered a training day at Redguard, Ghostise's voice lilting across the courtyard, ""Remember recruits, never take more than three sips. That's all you need. More than that, and your blood will burn."" The Grandmaster had interrupted, like he always did. ""I'll stick with coffee, thanks, Lord Commander."" The recruits laughed.

They always laughed.

Asde looked at the Candle. He was running out of time. The empty bottle spun lazily twice on the table before coming to a stop as the Lord Commander of GreyWatch got back to work.

------------------------------------------------------------

***Castle Redguard***

The Grandmaster's eyes watched as the Knights from GreyWatch arrived and were assigned Redguard bunks. His fingers danced as he ran the calculations in his head against the stores, the new inhabitants, and how much his hunters would need to bring back each day. While not ideal, it would work. It would have to. Hours later, Gryph's fingers were still dancing...but with an edge.

Something was wrong. Before the thought was fully formed he'd turned back to the Barracks, the GreyWatch Knights. He'd stopped and spoken with over half of them, words of reassurance, Brothers and Sisters, they were safe, Redguard was strong. Redguard Provides, Redguard Prevails. All the while, ice creeped up his spine as the face he was looking for, the flaw in his calculations, kept not being seen. *Brother, where art thou?!*

------------------------------------------------------------

***Castle GreyWatch*** 

His blood was burning. His blood was singing. The demons were screaming. 

Asde's spear danced all around him, slicing demons, scorching them as Mage Fire erupted from the blade and hasp. Even as scores of them lay dead around him, their faces kept showing surprise as the flames proved not only painful but deadly. 

All that time manning GreyWatch, Asde had had plenty of time to master Fire. His plan was working, all the demons that had remained outside or on the flanks were coming to him. To stop the troublesome Knight. The stone beneath him was a sodden mess of both their blood and his. He imagined Gryph beside him, chastising him for being so careless. *It's mostly theirs, Grandmaster!* 

Soon. His hidden wards told him without words that nearly the entire Legion was within the castle, surging to overwhelm him. So they could overwhelm Redguard next. 

*Not on my Watch, bastards.*

------------------------------------------------------------ 

***Castle Redguard*** 

Gryph's steps slowed as he approached the last member of GreyWatch. This one was not at ease. They looked incredibly uncomfortable...and not surprised at the appearance of the Grandmaster. They stood at attention. Gryph glanced around. *Hrrm. Not here.* ""Walk with me, Sergeant."" 

""Yes, my Lord Grandmaster."" 

The Grandmaster led the GreyWatch Sergeant up on the North wall, gesturing to the Redguardians manning it to give him the Wall. When he was certain they were alone, he turned to speak, and stopped, looking at the dispatch, sealed with Asde's sigil, in the Sergeant's outstretched hand. He took it, and clutched it. He stared at the Sergeant, standing at attention, not looking him in the eye...quietly weeping. 

""Sergeant, I have counted all of you, and counted again. My orders were for all of GreyWatch to fall back to Castle Redguard. Yet GreyWatch is one. Member. Short."" 

Their eyes darted to the dispatch, to the gaze of the Grandmaster, and winced, ever so slightly, before staring dead ahead once more. 

""Where is Lord Commander Asde? Why do you stand here before me instead of him? Where is the Warden?!"" 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

***Castle GreyWatch*** 

More of his blood was mixed with the pink slime at his feet. The burning had passed several score dead demons ago. Now there was only Song. He could feel that every one of the thousands of Pinkerium demon spawn were close. He had hoped Pepperglitter would have appeared as well, but he was still pleased. With a flourish, he spun his spear all around him in an eruption of flame, and then, in the moment the Horde hesitated and reared back, he slammed the heel of his Spear into the stone as he knelt, and grabbed the straps of his pack tightly. 

""Button Vult!""

------------------------------------------------------------ 

***Castle Redguard*** 

The Light from the north was so bright, Gryph spun away from it, knowing it would be worse than staring into the Sun. The GreyWatch Sergeant had turned as well, still standing at attention. The Grandmaster looked down into the courtyard. Everyone had stopped. No one moved, enthralled by the appearance of a second sun in the sky. Gryph braced himself, anticipating the shockwave that would follow. When only a gentle rumble rolled over the castle, Gryph grimaced...and felt tears fall. *Beautiful and terrible Magic, Brother.* 

Glancing to the Sergeant, they were losing the battle for decorum. ""Be at ease, Sergeant. I have my answer. Dismissed."" They bowed, and quickly left, likely to tell the others of their Lord Commander's sacrifice. 

The Light was fading. Gryph watched as the glow on the Northern horizon flickered, settled, and was then gone. He opened the last dispatch from GreyWatch, and read of Asde's plan, the spell bomb, the wards, the immolation of multiple Pink Legions. He even apologized for disobeying the Grandmaster's orders, hoping that this sacrifice would dull the Pinkerium's lust and buy Redguard and the Order more time. 

As tears fell without regard, Gryph turned the paper over to look at his friend's seal again, the profile of his favored weapon. *Tip of the Spear, indeed, old friend.*",2,1727887423.0,AprilKnights,0,1.0,False

Aw man I shouldn't have put the eyes inside my mouth! Sure it’s creepy but I have to permanently pog in order to see anything… screw it i’m growing eyestalks. 

I reabsorb the eyes inside of my mouth as two… no, three eyestalks grow out of the top of my head.

I don’t know if it’s the monster’s embrace or if i’m just expecting it but honestly… I don't feel weird at all anymore! Even though My vision is MUCH more three dimensional than it was before, it just feels like it’s natural now. 

“Chief! C-come on! Get up, that's not funny!” One of the two asshats shouts with a shaky voice. Bro he’s literally choking on his own puss-filled blood, what are you thinking?

“What in the fucking hells is that thing!!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU!?!?” Yells the other while pointing a spear at me. At least that one’s asking real questions. Oh that reminds me;

“Wait guys one sec, i forgot something.” I say to them, confusing them to high hell as I sprout a thick exoskeleton. Hmm… I have an idea… 

With a little bit more focus I add an extra layer of  tooth enamel to my exoskeleton, Making myself even tougher as I do so!  


**NEW PERK DISCOVERED:** 

**Enamel carapace**

*You are able to reinforce your exoskeleton with tooth enamel. Doing so doubles your defense but reduces your speed and mobility by half in the affected area.*  


**NEW FUSION PERKS ADDED:**

**Enamel Carapace+Pressure adaptative=Hardening**

You can reflexively harden parts of your body at will. This completely immobilized the part in question but the change is very quick and makes the area nigh-impenetrable.



Oh hell yeah! That’s gonna be a really good thing to have.

“Here we go! NOW I’m ready to horrifically maim you guys!”

“GET AWAY FROM ME YOU HORRID FLESHY TAagghkkkgrrgggrrg-!!!!” He screams charging at me with a spear which I easily doge before puncturing his stomach with my tail. 

“Well well well… that’s not very acidic isn’t it? Let’s lower that pH balance yeah?” I say before filling his stomach cavity with much more potent acid.

The effect is immediate as he starts screaming like a rabid goat before I even withdraw my stinger. 

“MY INSIDES ARE MELTIIIIINNNNGG!!!!” He screams between bouts of throwing up blood. Like, yeah no shit Sherlock, I can see that! Your intestines are spilling on the floor along with half melted flesh and skin. But I don't wanna sound like I'm complaining tho. I LOVE hearing slaver scum scream in horrific agony\~

“Alright you’re ne-!” I say turning my eyestalks to the other one just as he’s trying to swing an axe at my head. 

***“HARDENING”*** I Shout right before his axe impacts me with a  loud clang and the bounces right off my shell. 

Yeah yeah, I know I didn't actually need to shout the name of the ability I use like a cheezy shonen protagonist but also, I can do whatever I damn want so screw you!

The recoil of the impact sends him staggering backwards as he falls on his stupid ass. Clearly he thought he was hot shit… Let’s prove him wrong.

*“It’s time for a* ***high-zero*** *big boi!\~”* I say as I rub my blades together.

“WAIT NO PLEA-” He tries to beg in a panic, raising his hands in a conveniently choppable fashion for me to remove which I happily do! Sending them both tumbling to my spindly legs as he starts screaming in pain and horror.

…

Okay, Actually I do wish they wouldn’t scream THAT loudly. It’s kinda starting to hurt my ears. 

…

…

Uuuugh… for bollocking wank’s sake! This asshole is really getting on my bloody nerves! How long is he going to keep this bastarding screamfest!

“**SHUT UP ALREADY!!!** CAN’T YOU JUST DIE A LITTLE MORE QUIETLY FOR FUCK’S SAKE!” I scream at him in anger and annoyance.

“MY HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNDS!!!!!!” He yells back somehow even louder! How the hell can his throat handle that?

“YOU DON’T HAVE ANY BLOODY HANDS ANYMORE YOU STUPID GRASP-IMPAIRED TWAT FACE! STOP SCREAMING ABOUT IT!”

Ok that’s it, I can’t take anymore of this cunting scream-a-ton! I’m gonna give him the Roman senator special!   


“**WILL!** *\*shank\** **YOU!** *\*shank\** **PACK!** *\*shank\** **IT!** *\*shank\** **IN!** *\*shank\** **ALREADY!!!** *\*repeated shanks and then disembowelment noises\**”

  
...

  
Phew. Ok At least THAT shut him up. Ok i think that’s all of them? Let’s see…

Well screamy mc Loudthroat is dead, that’s for sure…

Gurgle J Meltyguts is also dead, I think, since he stopped twitching and all his intestines are a half melted puddle on the floor…

And Fatbastard Von-Swineworth here looks like he’s done choking on his own juices. As far as i can tell, that was all of them.

Okay! Now that the trash is taken out, time to check upon that girl and hope she isn’t too trauma-... oh… She fainted…

Well… shit that doesn’t bode well for the mental trauma factor…

Also I just killed three guys…

…

…

Okay… fuck, okay i- huhh…

I… Just killed three people… that’s definitely a thing that… i… you know… did…

Fuck…

Holly shit okay, the realization of it is starting to settle in now! I just killed three people! I Did! I can’t deny that I just killed a person! And I did that thrice…

Oh god… that’s… well… I don’t know how to feel about this… I mean yeah they definitely had it coming and deserved it, I’m not gonna second guess that. But Still! That’s still legally murder…

I take a deep breath, in and out before I try to calm my thoughts and get them in order. Did I do it? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. Do I really regret it? Not really, they were slavers so I have no reason to regret killing them… Would I do it again? Honestly, absolutely. Will there be consequences? I mean… probably but I’ll deal with that when it comes up. After all, it's not like I was expecting to be able to ice slavers with impunity in a world where slavery is not only legal but likely state-endorsed as well. So yeah I'm a criminal, big whoop. I’m not gonna follow the laws that were written BY and FOR slavers anyways and I was never planning to do so.

I let out a sigh as I got my shit together and got over my new status as a technical murderer.

Honestly I'm probably just dissociating a bit but I don't really have the time or the opportunity to get therapy anymore so eh. I’ll just deal with it and get nightmares I guess.

That being said, what do I do now?

Well I'm starting to get REALLY hungry and I'm willing to bet that this goblin girl probably is too, considering her skeleton couldn't even be any more visible if she was an anatomical illustration in an old schoolbook.

The issue is, I can feed myself easily, I’ll just eat these three cunts here.

What? Stop reading me like that! they’re slavers! They’re more worthless than actual shit anyway! The least they can do is be a decent snack.

*STOP SAYING I’M DISSOCIATING! I’M DOING FINE!!!*

Anyway, point being, food is no problem for me, but for her? I'm not gonna make her eat People meat. Even though I don't consider them people, they still have some… Elf i think? Well, “sentient humanoid” dna in them and I don’t want her to catch whatever this world’s equivalent of Kuru or mad cow disease is.

Not to mention the fact that it would be pretty fucked up regardless. I mean she’s the only innocent one here and it’s still technically cannibalism even for me. So while i’m okay being a cannibal considering i’m not really a human anymore, (i’m honestly more of a monster now) That doesn’t mean she should be okay with it! Especially when there’s probably other options…

The issue is, I can't exactly leave her here where she might get attacked by a cougar or something while I'm off hunting deer in the woods! Especially since she might wake up and run away, and I don’t even wanna THINK about having to chase after her, especially since she probably REALLY doesn’t need that kind of stress right now.

So I need to somehow find something she can eat while staying nearby enough to be here when she wakes up. “How in the fuck am I gonna do that?” I ask myself while scratching my head.

But then, as I look around… I see a terrified horse looking at me…

“Well, looks like I found her dinner...” I say, raising my arm as I prepare to shoot a long sharp tooth towards its head, making sure to leave it relatively sterile and Undiseased. “Sorry bud, but… I'm in a bit of a pinch right now.” I say seconds prior to losing the shot right into its skull before it can even turn around. 

Man… Poor horsie… At least that was probably pretty painless… I hope…

Well at least horses have a lot of blood so it’s time Give that “mutative hemophagia” perk a good old college try.

I approach the dead horse and stab it into where, I Assume, it’s jugular is (it’s honestly kinda hard to tell with a neck THIS thick) with a long, sharp and hollow tooth which I extend out of my arm before starting to suck its blood out like a straw. After all, it's not like a dead horse needs his blood anymore.

wow! that perk wasn’t lying about nourishment! I already feel less hungry after only a couple gulps! It’s not that much of a difference but it IS noticeable!

Woo! I got hooves baby! Nice! Also finally a smell perk, It’s not the best apparently but it beats having to kill a dog, because hurting a poor doggo is quite literally the last thing I EVER wanna do.

Anyway, it’s time to start a fire… Now that’s kind of a problem because while I can make a fire pit, I don't exactly know how to make fire without at least a flint and steel! I’m not exactly a survival expert and sure I could spend the next hour rubbing sticks together but I'll probably end up doing it wrong anyway soooo… yeah.

Oh! Maybe these scumbags have something on them! I probably should look at their bodies before I eat them. In fact  this guy has some nice pants… I quickly rip them off his legs and return back to my human shape. I heard that dead guys sometimes shit themselves and I prefer to get that one while it’s still clean.

Thankfully there’s not even a pee stain on that one. Guess he had an empty bladder so he didn’t piss himself before I killed him! There’s still quite a few blood stains but… heh.. That’s not the biggest deal. Also he’s really fat so at least I have some growth margin!

Anyways, let’s see if they have anything to make fire…

As I rummage through their pockets I find quite a few things, OH Hell yeah! Flint and steel, nice! There’s even an oil pitch and some cheap rum! At least I think that’s what it is?

Look, honestly I'm the most sober guy you’ll ever meet. I’ve never drank jack shit beyond a tasting sip out of curiosity and my conclusion was always the same: “how in the fuck do people drink this shit and actually enjoy it???”. Same goes for coffee honestly. Like yeah, I get it wakes you up but IT’S SO FUCKING BITTER!!! Wtf people! Bitterness is not an enjoyable taste by itself! It’s literally the most unpleasant mouth sensation possible! At least spiciness has a bit of an endorphin grease value and enhances the flavor but coffee's just bitter and nothing else unless you mix it with a fuckton of milk and sugar to make it taste even remotely drinkable! I just don’t get it!!!

Sigh…

So yeah. Really I’m just assuming it’s rum based purely on the VERY strong smell of ethanol. Which I absolutely despise (hence why I don't drink, I just can’t stand the taste and smell of ethanol), but alcohol is still a great disinfectant, even when impure, so that’s gonna make things MUCH easier if I ever need to disinfect a wound.

What else do they have…. Hmm… a few waterskins, very nice, Bunch of weapons I don't care about… tho that spear would probably make a decent spit for cooking that meat! I just gotta find some Y-shaped branches to put it across and spin it above the fire pit to cook the meat!

Look at these bastards\~ they’re well equipped aren’t they?\~

We got a good 30-ish meters of hemp rope, Always useful in an adventure…

Oooh! Money! What kind of metal is that?... It looks like brass I think? Definitely too light to be gold. Either way I'm keeping that! I don’t know what those coins are called yet but I counted about 343 moneys and 80 cents between the three of them with the fat bastard carrying the bulk of it. 

Hey a map! That’s gonna be useful! I can’t quite pinpoint where I am yet but I'll fly up later and check as best I can.

What else… some Cuffs, that’s going in the trash, some ooh! Some dried meat, hardtack and fruit pastes! Yum!

Should have checked before I killed that horse… but heh. It’ll give her more options.

A bunch of keys too… Even if they’re for the manacles I've already tossed, I probably should keep them just in case they’re for something else. As for the rest of their clothes.. Well only the ones that are still in decent shape are these pants that I just stole sooo… yeah.

Even though I want to give that poor girl some decent clothing, I'd rather not give her some that are not only three times too big for her size but are also covered in gore. I’ll just use my web weaving powers to make her a dress or something.

Oh wait! Fat boy had a little piece of jewelry on him! A ring!... Oh woooow. That one’s really fancy… and the gem on it glows purple in the dark too?

Huh… I don't wanna make assumptions but either it’s radioactive or it’s magical… and considering this guy’s been wearing it for a while, based on the mark around his finger, and wasn’t dying of cancer before I killed him, I'm assuming that it’s probably magical. I wonder what it does? I mean it certainly didn’t help him survive…

Hey dee? Any idea of how I could find out what it does?

***\[Apologies master Cornelius but I don’t know either. However I do know that you would not be able to use it.\]***

What? Why not?

***\[Well as was said before, you are completely unable to use magic, UNLESS you find a creature with a magical organ and absorb its dna, which will allow you to replicate and use the same organ’s magic effect yourself but nothing more outside of this specific set of circumstances. This means that you are not able to use magical items either as they require attunement to one’s own inner magic to function which is not something you have. From a magical point of view, your body is like an empty vacuum that sucks in the surrounding magical energy and nullifies it. On the plus side, this means that your potential magical organs will be much more powerful as they can take in magic energy from their surroundings in order to activate instead of having to tap in your own slowly recharging magic energy reserve like is the case for every other living being able to use magic. But ALSO, it will make you unusually resistant to magic cast at you.\]***

Oh yeah? In what way? Do I just like… take less damage from a fireball?

***\[yes but that’s not the only effect. You are also completely immune to charming effects as well as transformations magics.\]***

So... Does that mean I can't be mind-controlled or turned into a chair? Like ever? Is that what you’re saying?

***\[precisely master Cornelius. Do keep in mind however that while you are immune to THESE two specific things, you are only resistant to every other magical effect. Meaning they can still affect you.\]***

Yeah that’s true… I really should be careful about that. I’m kinda sad that I can’t use magic objects but eh… at least that way it’ll make sure I don’t get cursed by the one ring or some shit.

Oh… that goblin girl is starting to stir a bit during her slumber. I should probably get on with eating these guys and chopping up that horse for her to eat.

I open my abdomen into a gaping maw filled with sharp teeth and extend a triad of tentacle-like tongues out of the inside of it, dragging the three slaver corpses towards me.

I pause a little just before I start chomping down… Am I really going to eat them?

I hesitate for a few seconds before shrugging and munching all three of them down into my body. After all, I'm already a serial killer. Might as well be a cannibal on top of it. Not like I was gonna bury these pieces of trash anyway.

Nom-nom time!

Wow! Holy crap I'm immortal now! At least biologically! That’s actually kind of a big deal… I don't really know how to feel about the fact that I'm essentially gonna see everyone I meet eventually die of old age or other consequences… Will I still be there the day after the end of the world? What will I do then?

I shake my head, removing these thoughts of existential dread out of my head. Worst case scenario, I can probably just jump into an active volcano and end my life that way. At least this means that ending slavery is no longer a lifetime’s ordeal! I can take as much time as I need with it to make sure it’s all gone. THAT’s objectively good.

Also yeah i got a way to see what that ring does now so that’s convenient! But I don't really need it as my Cerebrophagia perk activates and sends some truly horrific images in my brain…

Apparently this ring is voice activated, you choose a word of your choice (which by the way, this bloated asshole chose the word “submit”, because of course he did…) and you can hold your hand out to suck out the lifeforce of whoever you’re pointing at! He apparently did that to a LOT of slaves. Whenever he would catch a minor cold or get a superficial cut, he’d use it to suck several years off of a random slave’s life. WAY MORE than he needed too.

Ok I definitely don’t feel a single bit bad about eating him anymore. If anything, the irony of me eating his fat corpse is quite funny considering he was essentially doing the same thing for a long time.

Oh and also I learned quite a few other things. For one the coinage they were carrying is apparently called “Daikus”, and it doesn’t really have a plural. It’s “One daikus, some daikus” with the “cents” being called “Dykos” so that’s good to know. More importantly though, i learned AN ENTIRE FUCKING LANGUAGE! 

Jesus christ, i’m not even joking, i was already bilingual (french and english) but now i know elvish as well! Just because I ate this guy’s brain!

Apparently, English, which was the language I spoke to them so far, is not actually called English here, it’s just known as “Aurosian” and is apparently the language of the local nation.

I try to dig deeper into my stolen memories but I realize that politics, history and other related subjects, while present in these memories, are very fuzzy. I’m willing to bet that cerebrophagia only gives me access to the memories that are one of three things.

That being;

*1-Something that the brain either finds fun or interesting, Like fond memories or intriguing facts for example, (then again, most of it is really detached in terms of how i experience these memories myself)*

*2-Something it considers to basically be automatisms or committed to muscle memory, such as the ability to speak a language or know how to use certain tools of one’s trade with proficiency,*

*Or 3- a very important thing to remember. Such as locations that are key to one’s job, the function of an important object or the name of an important person.*

Then again, I don’t remember any of these guys' childhood nor do I even have a clue what their parents or other relatives might have looked like. So unless they all forgot their own moms and entire childhood, I'm assuming it probably doesn’t let me access stuff that’s too personal about my victims. And honestly I'm kinda glad about it, because if you think about it, accessing these memories would very likely change my outlook on life due to having a very different experience added to my own and thus would likely change me in bad ways. Maybe I'd even become okay with slavery which would be absolutely awful.

But that’s not the most important thing right now. At least I know from the memories of these three wank-stains where they came from. That is to say, a big ol stronghold not too far from here called “Rusted point”. Apparently it acts as a mix between a slave trading post as well as an iron ore mine and military stockpile. I also know how they got here and how to go back there. Not only that but I also know where I am on the map as well as the location of the nearest settlement! So that’s great but it can wait a little bit.

Right now I've got two problems.

One, eating these guys may have sated me but it added their ENTIRE MASS to my body! Meaning that with the three and a half of them, (i’m counting an extra half because of how fat that bastard’s ass was,) i’m the size of FOUR AND A HALF GUYS!

My new pants which used to be way too big for me are now ripping apart at the seams. I’m literally bigger than that entire dead horse. Oh there it goes… well shit. My dong’s out again… well let’s improvise. I’ll cover it however I can while I'm cooking that dead horse.

Oh wait! I got an idea\~



**PERSPECTIVE SHIFT: Point of view of Wassingue, the escaped goblin slave girl.**  


Uuugh… I start to stir as I awaken. My ever-present hunger unsurprisingly is still burning in my belly. However it’s still strange… I don’t feel cold… it’s like I'm wrapped in a gentle embrace and kept warm with a somewhat rough but still soft layer of fur surrounding my body. The smell of cooked meat wafting into my nostrils and the warmth and noises of a fire radiating over me but not so closely that I fear getting burned… Instead I feel a comforting sense of protection and comfort which I hadn't felt in seven years of my twenty-eight years of life ever since I was enslaved… Am I dead? Did that thing kill me after all and I'm just in heaven?

I risk opening my eyes and see… the same place I was in before I fainted?

I see a large fire pit next to the carcass of a dead horse that has been butchered and cut apart in order to peel away the skin and remove the meat from the bones. Meat which is now roasting on the fire in front of me, skewered across what I recognise to be the spear of one of the chief’s guards, now reduced from a weapon of murder to a disposable cooking utensil…

I see a hand too… A very big one, as big as an ogre but less clumsy looking, gently rotating the spear above the fire, ensuring it roasts in a uniform way… as the arm that it’s connected to originates from somewhere above me…

…

I don’t dare to look up yet as I shake with dread… instead choosing to look down and tremble as I realize that I am currently being held gently inside the pocket of some giant warm… pants? It looks like pants but when I touch it, it somehow feels like skin to the touch… Like these pants are a part of the giant person wearing them somehow. 

The creature holding me in these strange pants is currently knelt down so I can't actually see that creature’s feet but the legs are somewhat thick and muscular, similar to the thighs of something that walks on two feet.

As I finally manage to look up, I see a strange face. A man with a short beard akin to a smaller version of a dwarf’s yet with a more chiseled face, with small but still somewhat prominent eyes and a medium sized nose who looks halfway between a halfling and an elf... Ginger hair akin to those of the Pyzorians if slightly more yellowish in tone and the red-colored pupils reminiscent of the Omelirians… Not to mention his ears… at fits I think they might have been cut short and sliced in half but looking closer I can easily see that they’re just round and lobed… it’s just their seemingly natural shape… 

Just as I look in confusion, a stray speck of floating cold ash makes its way straight into my nostril, causing me to reflexively and loudly sneeze.

I quickly cover my mouth in abject horror as the giant pauses and looks down at me… his eyes piercing my very soul…

Then he… smiles?...

“Oh hey! You’re finally awake, aren't you sleepyhead?\~” He says in a bantering tone with a small chuckle. “You were out cold for more than half an hour I think?” he adds before pausing and looking up before nodding slightly and correcting himself, “Dee says it was 39 minutes apparently. But eh, I was close enough wasn’t I?”

I look at him baffled, unsure whether to be scared, amused or completely confused anymore… who in the blazes even is this “Dee” person he’s talking about?

“Oh my name is Cornelius by the way!” He then says, seemingly as an afterthought. “And before you start to panic please just understand that you don’t have to worry about me, these slaver shits are dead and I, for one, am absolutely not planning to hurt you! I know it’s hard to believe considering what you saw back there but it IS, in fact, the honest truth. I mean, if I was planning to hurt you I wouldn't be cooking this horse here for you to eat now would I?” He quickly adds.

My eyes go wide at his statement and I can't help but ask him in disbelief, “w-wait… You… you were that thing that killed them all???” I ask in shock. “I… I almost thought it was some sort of weird nightmare and now you’re telling me i-it was your doing???”

“Eyup!” he responds, smirking proudly like he didn’t just confirm something completely insane. “Sorry by the way. I didn’t mean to scare you, I just got a little out of control…” He adds, sounding regretful. Not about the death of the ones who oppressed and enslaved me but about the fact that said deaths scared me and made me worried…

Before i can even process the current events unfolding around me, the pants start to throb around me confirming my suspicions about their fleshy nature while also making me notice something against my foot which as i look down, turns out ot be a piece of hardtack as well as several bits of dried pork.

“The horse will be ready soon. Until then, go on and dig in.”

I have to do a double take at his words… I almost can’t believe it as I reach deeper into the strange pocket and pull out the dry salted biscuit… tears welling up in my eyes as I finally get to eat something that isn’t this terrible-tasting and barley nutritious flour and lemon gruel that gets fed to slaves in order to keep us just full enough to avoid us dying of starvation or scurvy while not really preventing either of the two…

I can’t believe I'm crying over the prospect of eating hardtack of all things as my mouth opens and chomps down on the solid block, managing to break off a small chunk of salty dry and hard material…

And to be honest, to my starved and deprived palate, that hard, salty, almost flavorless block of almost unexpirable survival food tastes like heaven itself.

I weep and cry with pleasure, choking back tears of relief and emotions as my mouth fills with the unfathomably delicious bland taste of this stupid rock-hard biscuit.

My jaws hurt with every bite I take of this terribly solid piece of processed wheat, yeast and salt but I don't care one single bit. To my starved, tired and emaciated body, this might as well be the taste of heaven itself... 

I can see the giant grinning at me like a proud father as I look up, yet despite everything that’s happened, I can't even fear it anymore. All I can feel right now is joy, relief, gratitude and the blissful sensation of a slowly filling hunger…

“T-th…\*snif\* Thank…you…” Is all I manage to blubber out between choked sniffles and ravenous bouts of biting and chewing at the divine piece of bland, cheap biscuit in my hands. His smile turns sad and protective at my words as his eyes fill with something I haven't seen in a long time… A look of protective care and deep empathy…

1fukoi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1fukoi3/bf_is_against_hypothetical_long_distance/,bf is against hypothetical long distance ,"i (24f) recently applied to med school and got through my first interview. this has been my dream since i was little and im nervous and excited at the same time. my (25m) partner has been with me for nearly 6 years and has supported me so much throughout the entire process, sending me coffee money whenever i was studying, gassing me up, and just being an overall cheerleader for me to pursue my dream career. 

in the past, when we’ve discussed it, he’s usually said he’s open to traveling (he’s a nurse) wherever i’d go and do travel nursing. or he’d say let’s get an apartment together if it’s in our home city / state. it’s never been a concrete thing but if it got brought up in the past that’s usually what he’d say. 

the last few weeks have been rough and i could feel him kind of holding me at arms length. finally i broke down last night and asked what was wrong and he admitted he didn’t want to do long distance. he said he loves me and wants to be with me, but if i got into med school across the country (farthest i would be is a 3 hour flight, i applied to schools in my state and surrounding because i want to be as close to home as possible) he couldn’t do long distance again. (we dated throughout college and i went to a school 2 hrs away from him, but we made it work all four years). i was shocked to say the least after his past comments of being open to going where i go and he was very apologetic about not opening up sooner because it was really tearing him up. 

we both cried a lot last night and didn’t really come a solution, but we both agreed that we still love each other. i told him i felt like i wasn’t worth it if he’s so adamant now about not doing distance, and he said “no, it’s not you at all” but it kind of does feel that way still. he’s aware how contradictory he sounds and he just keeps saying he doesn’t have a good answer. 

i’m very distraught because this might be completely over nothing on the chance i get into a school close by. but if i do get in farther away, then he was basically like “i’ll always be in your life” but i couldn’t stand to hear that because i know i can’t ever just be friends with him. 

it feels like there’s now an expiration date on the relationship if i do go away for school. we both love each other so much and spent the rest of last night just holding each other and not sleeping well. 

how do i move forward? med school is my dream but he is too and i don’t want to give up one for the other. please help ",1,1727887189.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

But it's now three days later and I've got no bites.

Then when I was vacuuming yesterday it kept flying around the vacuum nozzle/head like it was trying to get sucked in.

Today it landed on my heel (I sit weird on the floor while working on the computer) and stood there. It wasn't biting me, wasn't trying to nor could it through the tougher skin of the heel.

1fukn3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1fukn3w/big_rant_please_share_thought_below/,Big rant - please share thought below,"Canadian GenZer here and holy shit I need to rant. 
Not sure if it's all of NA but, here it feels like our economy is (/has been) cannibalizing itself for like the past 5-6 years (at least!) 

Feels like every single job that pays minimum wage (which in my experience is most) has been effectively priced out by the greed of any and every other industry/standard that we used to rely on. 

- Food? Grocers got greedy during covid and haven't let up.
- Housing? Property owners got greedy during covid and haven't let up.
- Telecoms? They've always been greedy but they did the same thing when they realized covid crippled the ability to leave your home.
- Utilities: I can only speak to seeing my power bill go up but it too rose sharply in 2019 and hasn't returned to those prices since. (In Ontario, avg: 6.5c/kWh in 2018, peaking at 12.8 in 2020 and now sits at a steady ~8.2c/kWh.)
- Casual purchases? Dollar store goods, coffee, entertainment etc. Same deal. 
- Even Clothing? Paying attention specifically to the old 'budget friendly brands' like H&M and Old Navy, they too have skyrocketed in average price (and the only thing that's gotten better is their marketing!!!)
- Being part of any lifestyle activity: gym memberships, sports (both fees for playing and the equipment associated,) hell even if your hobby is dancing or yoga best believe it's now more expensive than ever. 
 
(Related: anything digital is a subscription now, every customer is effectively having their purchasing power siphoned. Drop by drop. Software, entertainment, hell even some hardware can't even be outright owned without a subscription fee now!)

It's also especially frustrating knowing that we lack any consumer protection when it comes to our data. (It's extraordinary valuable and these companies exploiting it know this!) Anything generated has and is being used against us, which leads to worsening a negative cycle of consumption. 

Each company has had an impact using this formula: Market like a mf. Increase the cost of all goods, (enough to cover the marketing and then some) extract the data from transactions, sell the data. Profit from data, profit from sales. Repeat. 

Anything that didn't used to break the bank has had the corporate treatment of hiring a consultant team to revitalize it and guess what? They just copy one another's strategies. Leading every business to practice the same tactics, making their business models all look the same. OKAY SIDE RANT DONE.

I promise I'm not a doomer but, I also have a hard time not being influenced to be one given the circumstances we face in our economy given the amount of factors suppressing wages.

Here's my biggest frustration yet. One company makes stupid profits from increasing their prices. A company in an adjacent or unrelated field copies them and does the same. Then another one and another one... so on and so forth. Eventually every company has done this and before you know it, the government or the companies' own employees get lapped before they were ever caught up to speed. And boom! We are where we are now.

The race to the bottom has already been won. GenZ lives in a world where the greed has already become a systemic problem, spreading from one business to the next. We live in a world where only our basic needs can't be met, we can't save and significant upgrades to our quality of life can be what put us in crippling debt. The government can't help (they've already tried as much as they're going to) and the private sector comes out on top. So we pacify ourselves with our devices, and escape to a digital world that is slowly succumbing to the same fate. In doing so further cementing our reliance on the technology companies which inspired the landslide growth in the leaders of every other industry. 

I bid you all the best of luck. Get a degree, or learn a valuable skill and be cautiously optimistic of what your employers demand of you. The only way we can fight back is by keeping our own best interest in sight at all times. Jobs of the past would destroy our health (physical or mental) and we know better than that now. If we're not going to get paid what we deserve, we ought to work by our own rules which protect us long term.

With much love. <3

I (30m) have been with my wife (27f) for 6 years, married for 4. I really love her. She's my best friend, and I really mean it. She's someone I can be both romantic, but also buddies with. I really thought this was perfect. We met at college since we shared a class together. I was in my last year of college, and she was in her penultimate year.

We were close friends, and for a while she was my ""wingman"". However, all the relationships that I got into at the time never really had the spark. That was when I realised that I'd ignored my real flame. The week after my midterms ended, I asked her out to coffee. We had the best time, and decided to go back to my dorm. If not for a piece of rubber, that coffee would have increased the population that day.

After two years of dating, as well as our respective graduations and entry into the workforce, we decided to get married. The wedding was perfect, even though we didn't have enough money for a fancy honeymoon. It was quite literally like a romance film, and I was ready for my happily ever after.

It really felt like that was the case for the next 4 years. We've never really fought about dividing work, since we're good communicators, we split up chores well. We decided to wait on having kids, which in hindsight was a great decision. As our finances improved, we even traveled together. Even my in-laws loved her. 

But she turned absolutely cold a month ago. Maybe a week after her brother's birthday party. If I had to do cooking, and she had to do dishes, she would only wash hers, and then make a new meal from scratch for herself instead of eating whatever I had prepared. She slept next to me, but wouldn't speak to me, look at me, and would slap my hand if I touched her even a little. She was absolutely unrecogniseable as the person i knew just a month earlier. I was scared. She would shut down at any attempt to communicate about it. One one instance, I saw her crying, and asked what was wrong. She just got up and kicked the chair upon which she was sitting, and snapped at me, ""How about you tell me?!""

I wondered if this was about our anniversary, her birthday, my birthday? I had absolutely no clue. But we celebrated all of those things, we had a great time. It was then I realised that this had everything to do with her brother's birthday. That day, I had slept with him to celebrate his 18th. But how could that be the reason she was that deeply pissed off at me? But none of that fucking matters now. Yesterday night, she served me divorce papers. She told me that we could evenly separate things between ourselves, sell the house and then just break away without a battle, or I could drag this fight on, and torture her by remaining in her life any longer, while wasting my own money and losing more stuff to the terms of divorce.

I don't know what to do. I could sign it and just get it over with, but I can't bear the loss of someone this crucial to my life. She has literally saved my life before. I can't bear losing her over something this... circumstantial and rather inconsequential. I just want to go back to the way things were before the birthday party. I love her so much. But I will never get the chance to reconcile, at least not without a court battle. But it's too risky. So yeah... Redditors assembel, and do your magic. Should I sing her a love song tomorrow night before she moves out to her parents' place?",0,1727886329.0,TrueOffMyChest,27,0.12,False

1fuk9q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fuk9q8/something_visits_me_every_night/,Something visits me every night,"I’ve always prided myself on being independent. At twenty-five, I had a solid job, my own apartment, and a tight-knit group of friends who I trusted implicitly. My life was far from perfect, but it was mine, and I was content. But all of that changed when I moved to a new city for a job opportunity that seemed too good to be true.

At first, everything felt exhilarating. The excitement of new beginnings kept me busy. I explored my neighborhood, scouted nearby cafes, and met my neighbors, who were warm and welcoming. Among them was an older woman named Mrs. Whitaker, who lived across the hall. She was kind and often invited me over for tea and cookies. I appreciated her company; it made the transition easier.

About a month after settling in, I began to notice something strange. I’d come home from work to find my apartment door slightly ajar, even though I was certain I had locked it. I brushed it off as my imagination, thinking perhaps I was just forgetful. But then I started finding little things out of place—my favorite coffee mug turned upside down, a picture frame slightly askew. I mentioned it to Mrs. Whitaker one day during tea.

“Oh dear,” she said, her voice dripping with concern. “You should really be careful. You never know who might be watching. People are not what they seem, you know.”

I laughed it off, attributing her comments to old-age paranoia. But as days turned into weeks, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I began to feel uneasy every time I entered my apartment, constantly glancing over my shoulder.

One Friday night, I returned home late after a long week at work. I was exhausted and ready to crash on the couch. As I fumbled for my keys in the dim light of the hallway, I caught a glimpse of movement in my peripheral vision. I turned to see a shadow slip around the corner of the stairwell, but when I looked closer, no one was there.

I shook off the feeling, convinced it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But that night, as I lay in bed, I heard it: a soft, persistent tapping on my wall. It was rhythmic, like someone drumming their fingers, a maddening sound that kept me awake. I glanced at the clock—it was well past midnight.

“Just the neighbors,” I told myself, but the tapping continued, growing louder and more insistent. It felt as if someone was trying to communicate, but I couldn’t decipher the message. Frustrated, I decided to confront the source of the noise. I got up, tiptoeing down the hallway, my heart pounding in my chest.

As I approached the wall, I paused, listening intently. The tapping stopped suddenly, leaving an eerie silence. I felt a chill run down my spine, but I pressed my ear against the wall, trying to hear anything.

Then I heard it—a faint whisper, barely audible, like someone was speaking right next to me. “Help me,” it pleaded. The voice sent shivers down my spine, and I jerked away from the wall, heart racing.

“Hello?” I called out, but there was no response. I turned on my heel and hurried back to my apartment, locking the door behind me. I crawled into bed, pulling the covers tight around me, but sleep eluded me for hours.

The next day, I decided to take action. I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me, so I installed a security camera at my front door. It was a simple, inexpensive device, but it made me feel a little more secure. I hoped it would help me catch whoever was tampering with my apartment.

That night, I replayed the footage from the camera, watching as the timestamp progressed. I didn’t see anyone enter my apartment, but I noticed something unsettling: every time I came home, the camera picked up a shadowy figure lingering in the hallway. It was subtle, barely there, but it made my stomach churn.

“Just my imagination,” I told myself, trying to rationalize it.

Over the next few days, the tapping continued, always accompanied by the faint whisper that haunted my nights. I stopped inviting friends over, too embarrassed to explain why I was suddenly so paranoid. I became a hermit, spending my days at work and my nights hiding in my apartment, waiting for the next unsettling noise.

Then one evening, I returned home to find Mrs. Whitaker waiting for me outside my door. She looked unusually pale, her hands shaking.

“Can we talk?” she asked, glancing nervously down the hallway.

I nodded, concerned. “What’s wrong?”

“I’ve noticed something strange in the building,” she said, lowering her voice. “There’s a man who’s been hanging around. He seems…off. I saw him watching you the other night.”

My heart raced. “What do you mean?”

She hesitated, as if deciding whether to share more. “I think he’s been following you. You must be careful. Lock your doors. Don’t let him in.”

“Are you sure?” I asked, panic bubbling up inside me.

“Yes! I’ve seen him lurking around. He watches you. He doesn’t know I’ve seen him, but I know. I can feel it.”

My mind raced. Had it really come to this? I felt sick, trapped in a nightmare I couldn’t escape.

That night, I barricaded myself in, checking and double-checking the locks. I even moved my bed to be positioned against the door, wanting to be prepared for anything. As I lay there, the tapping began again, louder and more frantic than ever.

“Leave me alone!” I screamed, but the whispers only grew stronger.

Then I heard something that made my blood run cold: a key turning in the lock.

My heart dropped. I jumped out of bed, scrambling for my phone, dialing 911 as I backed toward the window. I had to get out.

“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator’s voice crackled through the line.

“There’s someone in my apartment! They have a key!” I gasped, my voice shaking.

“Stay on the line with me. Can you exit through a window?”

“No! I’m on the second floor!”

Just then, the door swung open, and I froze, clutching the phone tight against my ear. A tall, shadowy figure stepped inside, silhouetted against the dim light of the hallway.

“Help me!” the figure said, voice distorted and low, echoing the same words I’d heard in the wall.

I turned and ran to the window, pushing it open as fast as I could. The operator was still speaking, urging me to stay calm, but I couldn’t think. I climbed out, my heart racing as I slipped onto the narrow ledge, desperately trying to find my footing.

“Ma’am, can you tell me what’s happening?” the operator continued, but all I could focus on was getting away from the figure inside.

Just as I was about to jump, I heard the operator shout, “Ma’am, stay where you are! Help is on the way!” But I couldn’t wait. I jumped.

The fall knocked the wind out of me, but I quickly scrambled to my feet and ran into the street, gasping for breath.

I looked back at my building, the figure standing at the window, staring down at me, its features obscured by shadows. I felt a mixture of relief and horror, knowing I had escaped, but still trapped by the knowledge that someone had been watching me all along.

The police arrived moments later, but by then, the figure had vanished. I explained everything to the officers, my hands trembling as I recounted the whispers and the tapping.

“Are you sure it wasn’t just your imagination?” one of the officers asked, his tone skeptical.

I glared at him. “No, it wasn’t. I have a security camera. I saw him!”

They took my statement but couldn’t find any evidence of an intruder. After they left, I felt emptier than before, my home no longer a sanctuary but a prison.

In the days that followed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was still being watched. I couldn’t sleep, constantly glancing around, waiting for the tapping to return.

And it did. Each night, the tapping echoed through the walls, the whispers creeping back into my dreams. The shadows grew darker, and I began to doubt my own sanity.

It wasn’t until a week later that I got the call. Mrs. Whitaker had passed away unexpectedly. They found her in her apartment, but that wasn’t the worst part.

When I went to her funeral, I learned something disturbing.

She lived alone, and there were no other family members or friends in the area. Everyone I spoke to mentioned that she had become increasingly paranoid in her last weeks, convinced that someone was watching her, someone who wanted to get inside.

As I stood at her graveside, staring at the fresh earth, I realized I was not the only one. Whatever was in the building was still there, and it had chosen us—two lonely souls in a city full of strangers.

I never went back to that apartment. I packed my things, left it all behind, and moved back home with my parents.

But even now, in the safety of their house, I still hear the tapping sometimes, a reminder that some things can never truly be escaped. And every time I do, I can’t help but wonder if I’m still being watched, still a part of someone else’s game.

Its speculated that I have ""Ibs-c"" and the only time I have a bowel movement is if I take a laxative...

But the past 3 days I've had some dairy and cheese, I tried coffee for the first time ever, and the carmel sweeter (I think thats what its called) had like a milk derived ingredient in it but I drink it anyway, it did not hurt my stomach at all, so I had some more the next day, did not hurt or give me gas. (But i wont be having anymore, I'm not a coffee person.) The 3rd day for dinner my mom made some spagetti and in the sauce it has cheese and she made dip that also had cheese and I ate that, it did not hurt my stomach. But the next morning, I had a bowel movement, a nice solid movement, I didn't have to force it out or anything. I'm just confused, if eating dairy is the only way I have a movement...

1fujzpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1fujzpl/aita_for_cutting_off_friendship_with_a_friend/,AITA for cutting off friendship with a friend after being gaslighted,"Hello,   
I think I get a morale check everytime I listen to Ms Charlotte Dobre's videos! This narration might be really long, Sorry! I just have one thing that constantly bothers me and wanted to share and look at different perspectives.  
I am 23(f) university student studying in one of the top tier colleges in my country and had recently joined for a year's course. New joinees to the laboratory often connected with me for stay options as I was staying off-campus because of less vacancy inside the campus. One such person was this 'friend' in question. Let's call her 'Hexia'(24f). I arranged a stay in the same building as mine for her and we bonded pretty well and quite fast due to our same native language. Soon I moved in to be her roommate. 

A little context:  It was a tough year and had a falling out with some close friends, and I really wanted a fresh start and new, meaningful friendships. I knew how important female friendships are and was hoping to connect with someone like that. Hexia and I bonded over being far from home, even though we were really different in our lifestyles, education, personalities, and even our eating habits. Despite those differences, we were grateful that we met each other during that time. 

Hexia was diagnosed with ADHD and used to take medications for the same. I had seen people suffer due to lack of empathy for the problems of the mind and I used to look out for her when it came to her problems. So much so that I used to order her meal order for her, help connect with people in the lab, to help her with her social anxiety. She constantly repeated that she was grateful for me helping her. But I was mostly concerned for her.

There came a time when Hexia got a vacancy inside the campus and had to leave on short notice. This was not in the rent contract and the landlord pushed her to make complete payment. I negotiated and payed for her share ( Hexia and I decided to split and pay the share but she never payed me back ) and she moved out hurriedly, but kept few of her clothes in the bedroom and the bathroom ( soaked in water ). Then she disappeared! Literally no contact for almost two months ( expect for once , to take one piece of clothing form the room) even though we worked in the same laboratory. I text her repeatedly telling her to collect her belongings and that the clothes in the bathroom have started to stink. She replies that she would do soon but never showed up.

It didn't bother me much as I had other things to deal with. One day she texts me that she will collect her clothes. She comes and apologies that she had a row with the landlord while leaving and hence she couldn't come and talk to me. I didn't think much of it during that time but I for sure wouldn't ghost my FRIEND because I had a fight with a third person!! I replied it was okay and she collected her stuff and left.

Next month, I had fallen very ill and was hospitalised for a couple of days and took a whole month to recover and had all of my friends helping me out (Shoutout to them for being on my side during that time). However, Hexia is still MIA and once, I see her at the cafeteria and she immediately launches into speech, telling me she heard about my health and why I didn't reach out to her, if I considered her as a friend. This conversation however didn't sit well with me as she kept repeating that because of ADHD it is often that she will forget to connect with people who are far away but at least I could have told her. I didn't have much energy to analyse then so I politely told her that I wasn't in a state to call anyone during that time and we parted ways. 

After this, I moved into campus and actively tried to invite her to plans, events, coffees it even just hanging out which she refused EVERY SINGLE TIME, telling her ADHD is acting up, she is emotionally tired or I should just go ahead. I constantly asked her if she was taking medications which replied she would. I brushed it off thinking she must be exhausted to get to these things or we might be actually finding different friend groups.  
I believe in keeping in touch in friendships ( the ones that really changed your life ) as well amicably parting and finding our own niches in connections if it's not working out.   
But this didnt happen so.. Hexia, few of our friends and I planned to visit a religious place on an occasion of a festival we proudly celebrate. However, my friend wanted to cook something nice for the evening as I was feeling homesick. So he secretly called all of my friends ( including Hexia ) and arranged a festival food cooking party that evening at my apartment. The evening came and went , with loads of laughter and home food, but Hexia didn't show up. My friend commented that he met her on the elevator and she confirmed she would join , so concerned , I texted her about this.   
She replies that 'truthfully' she didn't want to come as I ditched her on the plan we made and kept her in the dark! She said longer felt it was natural with me and if she were me , 'she' would have called me and not someone else. (Note : the whole plan was a surprise to me and I didn't call any of the other friends who had visited). I replied so, and left me on seen. I realised enough that I wouldn't be able to hold a personal relationship with Hexia as gaslighting me was the last straw.

Sadly, Professionally too it didn't work out. She had this habit of carrying away an extremely costly lab equipment to unprofessional places like cafes and her room, because she didnt get the 'vibe' to work at the lab. I too was using the same equipment for my studies and was extremely concerned about it's maintenance. We tried to arrange a system of log to keep track when the equipment leaves the facility but she never followed the professional working hours nor its tracking. Eventually after months, during my studies I faced extreme problems with the equipment. I had to run to her desk or flat or to someone else to collect it everyday and had no information about the changes in the equipment. Many of my runs failed due her negligence but she never corrected her ways. After imposing a strict law of booking the equipment only during the office hours, it became extremely bitter between her and me ( major users of the equipment ) where I realised I couldn't hold a professional connection with someone of these ethics. 

I wrote a letter stating this and that I wouldn't be able to continue this friendship and would no longer wish to interact with her. Few of my friends ( co workers of hers and mine) think I should extend my hand and patch up with her. Other few think she should realise the consequences for her actions. I still get agitated and fired up when I talk of her and not able to look at the other side of the coin. AITA for reacting the way I did, ending the friendship and for even writing this?

About Me:

I recently graduated from college majoring in archaeology. For work I am currently a self-employed photographer, and I'm also learning to do programming.

When I am not working or studying you will probably catch me drinking coffee and eating a sweet treat (I am a pretty good barista if I do say so myself). 

I love to stay active and enjoy hiking, swimming, and skiing. 

I am a green-thumb and tree-hugger and love to garden and be in nature. My dream is to own a vineyard someday.

Besides all this I also like going thrifting and antiquing, watching old movies, reading, and sometimes playing games on my pc. 

Though I live in the US, I love to travel and have always dreamed of living abroad. So I hope you will be open to that too! 

Physically, I am 5'9 and about 135lbs. I am skinny but fit. I have short light brown hair, and I have green eyes. 


My Ideal Partner:

I am ideally seeking an FLR. So ideally you will be someone who values taking the lead in the relationship!

I do not have much experience with poly relationships so I’m really looking for someone who is open to helping me explore this for the first time!

I value kindness, intelligence, humor, and warmth. 

I look for someone who craves those deep late-night conversations. 

I have no specific physical preferences, I believe that people who are beautiful on the inside show on the outside.

I hope that we will be within a few years of age of each other, though that's not a requirement for me.",0,1727885349.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.5,False

1fujukl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1fujukl/hotel_alfonso_xiii_sevilla_full_review/,Hotel Alfonso XIII Sevilla Full Review,"https://preview.redd.it/l8lrza4o6dsd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39543aceb6476d2fa02834437845dd6c8bf5ad89

This is a follow-up to my initial impressions of the hotel from a week ago.

As a hub for our Andalucia visit, we booked a Grand Deluxe Larger Room with Terrace at this Marriott Luxury Collection property for nearly $1,000 per night (which was on the low end of their rates as we booked this months in advance).  Although the online reviews for this property rate it quite highly, I was aware going in that some have expressed more negative views which -- when read -- seemed reasonable in their criticism.  As a result, to limit the potential for disappointment, we decided not to risk the expense of one of their suites - which, for us, turned out to be a good decision.  I also note for context that this visit followed our visit in Madrid where we stayed at the FS.

In terms of the property itself, I can understand generally the high praise this hotel receives.  It is a beautiful historic building with a killer location for those interested in seeing Sevilla's main tourist attractions.  It is steps away from Plaza de Espana, the Sevilla Cathedral, the Barrio Santa Cruz, and the Real Alcazar.  The grounds are lush and well kept, the hotel has an outdoor pool area with (periodic) service, and a very nice outdoor terrace for al fresco dining.  Inside the public spaces are equally impressive bringing a strong sense of this building's history and ornate Spanish style.  Unfortunately, for us, this is where the positives largely ended.

https://preview.redd.it/9ocwut2r6dsd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0f8c7d7761a04d1506541677b90620318f96407

Our room, while ""large"", was a disappointment.  While understanding the desire (or requirement) to maintain the building's historic properties, the room nevertheless conveyed that this was very much a Marriott property.  It was unremarkable in nearly all ways and looked very tired.  The bathroom, in particular, had seen better days with hundreds of what I told myself were water spots etched into the marble floor tiles.  The bed - while comfortable - was placed on a rug that was only maybe six inches larger than the bed's footprint.  The terrace was fine although narrow --but was, in fact, better functionally than our terrace at the FS -- with a small comfortable seating area and a market umbrella to shade the sun along with nice views of the Cathedral and Alcazar.  There were also two sad and dirty looking loungers in the corner that we steered clear of.  And, we discovered, the umbrella was not secured into its base (nor could it be) and it nearly blew over the railing the first day we were there.  The TV did not work (after 20 minutes of fussing with it, I pulled the console away from the wall and discovered it was unplugged!) and the remote control battery cover was bent away from the device allowing the batteries to randomly fall out.  Even though housekeeping returned the remote control from the nightstand to the TV console each day, they apparently couldn't bother to have the obviously broken device replaced or fixed.  Turndown service was hit or miss.  Some nights they showed up, some nights they didn't.

Breakfast, which was included for us, was fine.  While the spread was quite large, it was nothing really special.  A lot of standard items.  One morning I ordered Eggs Benedict off the menu and they came swimming in a lake of hollandaise sauce on top of raw English muffins.  We had drinks and a light dinner one evening at Ena -- their outdoor restaurant.  Food selection was somewhat limited and, again, you felt the corporate influence on the choices and the food preparation.  It was fine.

Service was the biggest disappointment here.  I note for context that this hotel actually has 50 fewer rooms than the FS Madrid where we stayed previously.  The service could not have been more impersonal and transactional - definitely Marriott-level.  I previously discussed our problems at check in so I won't repeat them again.  However, overall, there was no personal engagement by any of the staff - whether at the front desk, at the restaurants, or at the door.  The same person checked us in to breakfast each morning but treated us each morning as if we were new guests.  They don't even ask for your name - we were just a room number to them.  Servers in the restaurant made no attempt to engage with you - in fact, it appeared they actively avoided interactions.  Multiple tables had to flag down servers to get basics - coffee, milk, etc.  No umbrellas were provided in the rooms or in the lobby.  We were told to get them out front at the bell stand.  However, no bellman were to be found when we went outside.  When we requested a taxi one night to get to dinner, we were told we'd be better off ordering Uber or using the local taxi app.  To be fair, I do note that the hotel proactively provided us with a 50 Euro F&B credit due to the poor check-in experience, and one day they left us a bottle of sherry and some cookies.  

Someone suggested in response to my prior post that our problems here were likely due to us not booking a $3,000+ suite.  Opinions can certainly vary, but I really don't see the service issues here mattering that much based on your room.  The staff here are just not trained for hospitality - period.  And I would be even more disappointed if I had paid $3,000 a night for this mediocre Marriott experience.

**Alex Maverick and the Swamp Monster**

**CHAPTER TWO**

---
“Hand me that doughnut.”

“Which one is yours?” I’m looking at a drippy, glazed doughnut and a chocolate one with icing and sprinkles. The two pastries sit glued to the bottom of a paper bag, each contaminating the other with its own personal attire. Dutch brought them back with him from his ritual morning coffee routine. I’ve never been a fan of glazed doughnuts. Eating one leaves your fingers all sticky. Even if you lick them clean, there’s a thin veneer of sugar lingering on your skin unless you go wash your hands, as well as your own saliva. You shouldn’t have to wash after eating a food. Please don’t ask for the chocolate doughnut, Dutch.

“The chocolate one,” Dutch declares, destroying my only hope of enjoying the morning.

I hand him the doughnut, my fingers and the side of my hand becoming gooey from reaching into the bag and brushing against the slime coating of its brethren. He immediately shoves the doughnut into his mouth so he can keep both hands on the wheel as we make a turn onto the next street. I stare at the ooze running down my hand, sigh quietly to myself, and lick it off.

It’s already over 80 degrees outside, and the road ahead of us ripples like water from the heat coming off the pavement. The temperature wouldn’t be terrible I suppose, except it’s also as humid as a sauna around here. Sweat doesn’t evaporate in this mugginess, cooling the skin like it’s supposed to, it just sits there and makes you feel gross. Thank goodness Dutch’s truck has air conditioning. How can anybody stand living in a place this hot and wet? It makes me miss New England and home.

Dutch and I have circled the town three times already this morning. It doesn’t take long to go once around, but we’re trying to be cautious and not draw attention to ourselves. If somebody noticed the same beat-up truck with Massachusetts plates drive by multiple times, they might think we’re up to no good. Next thing you know, we’re dealing with that Lafleur guy again. He’ll dog us and make things ten times harder than they already are, which is saying a lot because trying to find a nightmare monster that you don’t even know what it is, what it looks like, or where it might be hiding is like looking for a grain of salt in a bag of rice. I just came up with that analogy off the top of my head and I’m very proud of it.

“You getting anything?” Dutch asks, looking down a side street at a man walking his dog. The pair stop and the dog starts doing its business while the owner looks around to see if anyone else is watching.

I get a flash that the man intends to leave without cleaning up after his pet, which is named after some ancient warlord. The man’s name is Clark Fisher and he lives with his wife, two kids, and a mother-in-law named Gertrude. Clark refers to his mother-in-law as an “old battle ax” to his friends, but he secretly finds her attractive and hopes his wife ages as gracefully as Gertrude has. Oh yuck, okay, shut that off. Shut that off, please, angels.

I make a mark in the road atlas we bought back in Pennsylvania, corresponding to this intersection we’re currently stopped at. I’ve been making marks all morning. Every mark is a point where I started getting the precognitive feedback and angel radio that normally comes through my meatball. After this latest mark, I try drawing a circle that goes through all the points, but what I get looks more like a pumpkin. Still, there’s a center to it, and with luck, that should be where we focus our hunt.

“I think I might know where we need to go.”

Dutch gives a grunt. Clark Fisher and his dog Attila just walked off, leaving Attila’s poo unattended. This irks Dutch, who is not much of an animal lover. I start picking up a memory of stepping in dog mess on the night of his Prom way back when he was in high school, but I block it out. Dutch and I have an agreement that I don’t use my radio to read his biography, and he doesn’t ask me questions about my own personal history.

There’s a problem. The center of my pumpkin does not have any roads near it. The closest one we can find turns out to be unpaved, little more than a dirt path. We drive down it slowly, in case someone comes from the opposite direction. Out my window, the ground dips down and turns into murky swamp, just mosquitoes, ferns, and trees. Speaking of trees, all the trees in this area seem to hover above the water, their roots plunging down into the sludgy green soup like they hiked their pants up to keep from getting wet.

This is where it’s hiding. The Honey Island Swamp Monster, if Dumah is correct. Or Abu the crocodile man, if Raziel is right. But, what if they’re both wrong? What if it’s a sasquatch or a hydra? What if it’s that Greek monster, the one that swallows boats and spits them up? Charybdis? I think that’s its name. Man, it’s been forever since I read a book of mythology. I wonder if this town has a library.

After several minutes, we come to a small clearing, big enough to park a couple vehicles. A beat-up, old Dodge station wagon has been abandoned here, half sunk into the swamp. Judging from the rust and overgrowth of plant life all over the exposed back section of the car, I would wager it’s been here since before I was born. There’s probably reptiles living in it, maybe even fish. No monster though.

We pull up next to the station wagon’s corpse, where I hop out of Dutch’s truck, throwing caution to the wind. Nothing wraps itself around my leg and drags me kicking and screaming into a watery grave, so at least I’ve got that going for me. Dutch is horrified by my recklessness though, and scrambles out of the driver’s side with a shout.

“Are you trying to get yourself killed?!” he yells at me.

“Relax, Dutch, there’s nothing here.” I gesture at the encroaching ferns and swampy water around us. No bird songs, no weird bugs rubbing their legs together to make an annoying racket. Just the wind blowing through the trees and making their limbs rustle and the sound of water lapping at tree legs.

That’s not true… there’s something else, another sound. It’s faint, “ever so” as my Nana would say. A child’s voice. Are they singing? It kind of sounds like singing. Not great singing, just a child’s singing. Like they aren’t sure of the words but they know the general notes of the tune so they make up the lyrics as they go.

Dutch digs his sausage fingers into my clavicle and spins me around, jabbing one of them in my face. “You didn’t know there was nothing here!” he snaps angrily, “You know and I know you got no angel magic warning you of squat, especially when we’re this close to whatever it is we’re hunting! I promised to protect you, so let me do my job.” Seemingly out of nowhere, he produces an old pistol and makes sure I see it, along with the bullets in its rotating set of bullet chambers. “Me and Smith and Wesson here.”

I’m honestly stunned to see Dutch has a gun on him. We didn’t have one before. I shrug his sausage fingers off my shoulder and scowl at him. “I’m sorry, Dirty Harry, when did you start packing a six shooter?”

“Don’t change the subject,” He casually stuffs the deadly weapon into the back of his pants. “Even ignoring the whole monster-in-the-closet we got going on, there’s wild animals in these parts that will take a chomp out of you. Not to mention all the venomous creatures that could kill you in a heartbeat.”

“Okay, well, now that you’ve made it clear how weak and fragile I am, let’s find this monster-in-the-closet, paint a target on it, and get out of here so the clean-up crew can do its job.” I sniff the air. It smells like marsh gas, which gets me thinking. “Did you have that gun stuffed in your pants this whole time?”

Dutch snorts dismissively. “No, I keep it under the seat in the truck.” He shifts his weight around like he’s given himself a wedgie. “You know, they make it look like no big deal in movies, sticking a gun in your pants, but it’s actually real uncomfortable.” After a minute of what I can only assume is him trying to adjust the pistol with his butt cheeks, he reaches behind him and withdraws it, then stuffs the gun into the inner pocket of his jacket where at least he won’t fire it off when he clenches up.

Now that that’s taken care of, I turn my attention back to the overgrown marsh that surrounds me. I mentioned how quiet it is before, but it’s starting to get real unsettling, almost as if everything is watching the pair of us, waiting to see what we do. I can only imagine that the swamp snakes and swamp spiders and those supposed swamp things that can take chomps out of me are giggling amongst themselves as they watch this middle-aged man fumble around with his toy revolver.

And then there’s that singing. Where is it coming from? Maybe someone lives nearby. That might help disprove Dutch’s claim that this place is a deathtrap. Not to mention, I can ask whoever we run into if they’ve seen anything strange in the area, like people with crocodile heads. I’m sure I’ll come off as completely sane and normal to them. Yep. Just me and this old guy with the gun in his jacket pocket that probably smells like ass now talking about croc-heads.

“Where are you going?”

I thumb the air. “This way, obviously. In the direction of the voice.”

“Oh, of course— the voice.”

I pause. “You can hear the voice, can’t you? The singing?”

Dutch looks up at the clear sky and swivels his head back and forth like a radar dish. He turns ninety degrees and does it again, repeating these steps several times. After a minute, he’s turned completely around to face me. He shakes his head. “Nope.”

“Well, all the more reason to investigate the voice if I’m the only one who hears it.” We just have to be careful, I think to myself, because what if I’m hearing the nightmare creature? What if only I hear it because only a veil-touched individual such as myself is attuned to its frequency? Raziel didn’t mention the croc-head or the Honey Island Swamp Thing having a child’s voice and any musical talent, but maybe those aren’t well-known aspects of its character. Better safe than sorry. “We’re going on foot,” I tell Dutch, “bring the hand cannon.”

“I was planning to bring the hand cannon,” he grumbles, falling into line behind me as the pair of us begin trekking further down the trail skirting the edge of the swamp.

Let’s talk about this swamp. Have you ever been in a swamp? They smell. I don’t know what the smell exactly comes from, but it’s mildly unpleasant in a way that I can’t describe. It’s not like sewer water or an unflushed toilet, it’s more earthy and stagnant. Rot? Maybe it’s the smell or rot. I can’t really say. I’m not an expert on smells. I’m not an expert on much of anything really. Didn’t help that I had to drop out of school to be on the road hunting nightmares. Maybe I can go back when I’m done. If I ever finish, that is.

But yeah, swamps smell. And this one smells even stronger than the ones I’ve been near in the past. But Alex, you say, when have you ever been in a swamp before? Well, actually, my Uncle George used to have a cabin in the woods on the edge of a lake, and there was a section of the land near there that was swampy. It wasn’t as bad as this place we’re in now, where the trees are hiking up their skirts to keep only their toes in the water. But everything was muggy and soggy and gross. And covered with that swamp smell.

We trudge down the increasingly wild route in silence. The dents where vehicles tires could travel soon disappear and we’re left with nothing more than a narrow path to follow. Ahead of us, the child-like voice gets closer. Something’s wrong though. This isn’t singing like I thought it was. It’s more like… crying. Not just crying either, someone is wailing, long and endlessly. Wailing like a… like a banshee. Oh cripes, I’m not dealing with a banshee, am I?

I’m gonna pause a moment and tell you about banshees. Banshees are ghosts who foretell someone’s passing, by which I mean their death. They indicate this by shrieking at the top of their lungs. Not that they actually got lungs, because they’re ghosts. Ghosts don’t got lungs. They don’t even got bodies, really. Most ghosts just float around like little, black clouds. Banshees are a bit more than ghosts, because technically they were never people to begin with. But hey look like people, usually family members. Dead ones. Thus, you know, people think they’re ghosts.

Banshees are Irish, meaning the tales of them were told in Ireland. Just like leprechauns and St. Patrick’s Day. So technically, if the screaming I thought was singing is a banshee, it’s not where it belongs. Just like a croc-head.

Now that I’ve thought that, I start having other thoughts, like maybe I’m walking in on more than just one nightmare. Maybe, I’m walking in on a whole nightmare hotel. Just an entire platoon of Veil beasts that were friends and decided they wanted to haunt the swamp all together. And then here comes Alex Maverick and her gun-crazy Uncle Dutch (he’s not really my uncle), walking into their den like a pair of rib-eyes at a steak-eating contest.

I freeze in my tracks. I do not want to be a rib-eye at a steak-eating contest.

“What is it?” Dutch shoves past me, drawing the pistol from his jacket and waving it around in front of him. “You see something?”

“No, I just—“ Actually, now that I’ve stopped, I realize the crying is just to my right, past the water’s edge and somewhere in the marsh right beside us. I turn slowly, feeling the tension in my shoulders as I try to not move anything but my head. Something dark is moving at the corner of my vision. It seems to know that I can’t fully see it and keeps staying just out of sight. And then, it’s gone. And the crying stops too. “I don’t hear the… the singing anymore.”

Dutch breathes a heavy sigh like both his lungs just collapsed. His fingers relax on the grip of his firearm, and he starts to tuck it back into the lining of his jacket, then thinks better of the idea and keeps it out, gripping it tightly once again. “Do you think it heard us coming?”

“I don’t see how, we’re a couple of ninjas, we are.” I say sarcastically.

“No, you’re not,” comes a small voice, catching the two of us non-ninjas completely by surprise. It comes from a tiny silhouette that appears just past a particularly reedy section of the swamp’s edge. A small, pale hand moves the tall weeds aside and out steps a young boy, no older than eight or nine. He looks disheveled and filthy, his hair is a tangled rat’s nest of auburn hair and there’s snot and mud mixed like watercolors across the lower half of his face.

Dutch lowers his giant hand cannon and finally gets around to tucking the piece away again where he can’t blow the top of a toddler’s head clean off with it. “What’s your name, son?” he asks the raggedy-looking little boy.

“Todd, sir,” says … well, Todd, I guess, wiping more snot and mud across his mouth and cheeks with the back of one filthy hand.

“Do you live around here?”

Todd looks around at where we are currently standing. “This is a swamp.” 

Dutch puffs out his cheeks. He does the same thing whenever he asks me a dumb question and I give him an obvious answer. “Do you live nearby? Where are your folks?”

The little filthy urchin casually sticks a finger in one of his nostrils. I’d like to think he’s trying to plug the leak that’s clearly started decorating the rest of his face, but more than likely he’s looking to keep the floodgate open. He twists and turns the penetrating digit for several seconds before popping it back out and wiping whatever he found in there on the leg of his pants.

“I don’t know where I am,” he says blankly.

What is with this kid? “Were you crying earlier?” I ask him. “I thought I heard you crying.”

This seems to trigger something in the child. His eyes grow in his head and he slowly swivels his neck to look at me. His pupils seem excessively large. I can’t even tell what color his eyes are. He doesn’t blink, he just stares at me. I stare back. I’m a stare-freaking master, my friends. And I don’t just stare, I take everything in while I do it. The way his nostrils flare rapidly, because his breathing quickened. Why? And the edge of his mouth is twitching ever so slightly, like he’s trying to stifle a smile.

“You heard me crying?”

Why is there a lump in my throat now of all times? “That’s… what I said.” I swallow down the lump. Not today, lump.

He tilts his head like a curious dog. “Who are you?” his eyes do a slow scan down from my head to my knees, then back up. I feel oddly uncomfortable by the way he seemed to study me. Sometimes, people give me a “once over” look where they’re trying to size me up. Sometimes I get those creepy looks that old people give young people like they’re wishing they could suck the youth right out of them and be kids again. And then there’s Todd’s look, where I feel like he’s seeing who I really am underneath it all, the secret person I keep from everyone.

Dutch steps in, thankfully. “We’re just passing through. Got turned around on the wrong road, then stopped and thought we heard someone calling for help. Can we give you a lift back into town?”

Todd does not look at Dutch. He continues to stare at me. “Who… are… you?” he repeats the question.

“My name’s Alex,” I tell him, trying not to let my voice break, “Alex Maverick. This is my… dad. He goes by Dutch.” I look at Dutch. He frowns at me. I probably should have come up with a fake name or something. I’m sure he’ll scold me on giving people his name without his consent later. Right now, I just want this creepy kid to stop staring at me with his big, black eyes. A strange, dangerous thought flashes in my head and I act on it without thinking. “Samael sent us.”

Dutch’s head, which was just starting to turn back to the tiny boy in front of us, snaps back in my direction at the mention of Samael’s name. “What?”

Todd doesn’t flinch. He doesn’t twitch or blink or give any of those basic tells. He just takes a moment to stare off at something past me. “Samuel?” he finally says with a tone that could be either real or feigned confusion, “I don’t know a Samuel.” He directs his attention back to me, then finally breaks his no blinking rule and gives Dutch his attention. “Can you help me get home?”

Dutch side-eyes me. “Sure.” He really drags out the word, like he’s trying to determine whether or not I’m okay with it. “Sure. Our truck is this way, back down the path.”

He clutches my arm and starts forcefully encouraging me to walk ahead of him. I don’t resist. Eventually, the three of us are plodding our way back down the soggy trail as the sun ducks behind clouds and casts everything around us in darker hues. I glance back over my shoulder every now and then to make sure that the mud-covered newcomer has not turned into a multi-taloned monstrosity with a whale-sized mouth full of barbed teeth. He hasn’t. He just keeps looking like a normal, albeit filthy, kid.

Dutch keeps an eye on him too. “You okay, son?” he asks Todd, “you got a bit of a limp. Did you twist your ankle?”

“I’m fine.” Nothing more is said on the matter.

For some reason, it feels like it’s taking longer to get back to the truck than it took to get *from* the truck to begin with. We are going the right way, aren’t we? I glance back at Dutch and give him a puzzled look. He doesn’t seem to know what it means though, and looks back at Todd as if I’m suggesting something about him. When he turns back, he shrugs. This is not helpful.

“Is it much further?” Todd asks. Is there a mocking tone to his question or am I just reading too much into it?

I don’t like this one bit. When I check the sun, it’s still behind the clouds, making it hard to tell how low it is in the sky. Have we been walking for an hour? I’ve lost track of time. Why isn’t Dutch saying anything? Surely he’s noticed that we’re still not back at his precious truck yet. We should be. We absolutely, definitely should be back at—

Oh, there’s the truck. It just sort of pops into view as we come around a bend in the trail. Was it not there a moment ago? Am I imagining things? When was the last time I had something to eat? I should have brought a bag of fruit snacks or something. Fruit snacks? What am I, ten? No, I should have brought a granola bar.

“There she is!” Dutch exclaims elatedly, finally revealing his own pent-up anxiety. So I wasn’t the only one starting to get worried. That’s a relief. I give a thumbs up over my shoulder, look back to give him a half-hearted smile, and that’s when I notice that our pesky little follower Todd has vanished.

“Where the heck is Todd?” I almost fall over my own feet trying to turn around.

Dutch is just as bewildered. “He was right behind me! Todd!” he puts his hands to his mouth to form a makeshift loudspeaker, “Todd! Where are you?!”

Todd doesn’t answer. What does answer are birds. And buzzing insects. And the sloshing of the swamp water against the edge of the land. All the sounds that had vanished are back. The swamp is alive again. Was it really quiet all this time, or were we just not hearing it? 

“We need to get back to the hotel,” I tell Dutch, making sure he hears the urgency that I say the words with, “I don’t know what that was, but it’s time to call in the cleaners.”",3,1727884748.0,Lillian_Madwhip,0,1.0,False
1fujo0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1fujo0w/i_went_to_the_dentist_today/,I went to the dentist today,"He greeted me by name, I've been going to his practice for a few years now. ""Remember me your age, please"", he said. To this I answered ""27“, I quickly counted the years in my head, and, sure it was in the ballpark, I went with that number.

He checked my history, ""coming to get a filling replaced?"". ""Yes"". ""Point at it, please."" He always does this. He has a little figure in the history, showing what tooth I'm coming for, but he always makes me point at it. I feel like sometime in the past he went at it at the wrong tooth, and always double checks with the patient. But still, some people don't even pay attention to what's going on in their mouth.

So he fixed the filling, and checked again with the little mirror, as the dentists do. ""I think we're good. Your teeth look fine, and the other filling you have is in good shape. Just cut back on processed sugars, sodas, ice creams, and that sort of stuff."" Then he gazed at the wall, and after a few seconds kept on talking: ""And you should cut your mustache next time you come. I fear it will get entangled with the mill, and will pull it off you face"".

I don't know if I'll be going back. At least this year. Next I'll have to go for a check up. But a pop tart in the morning, a soda with dinner, and an ice cream now and then, specially those Mcdonald's McFlurrys, with the thousands-something calories, extra caramel, and crumbled cookies bring me so much joy. Nothing else does. Well, a coffee does bring me a little joy. I'm gonna get one now.

My family and I are planning to move to the PNW in about 3-5 years once our youngest graduates from High School. We're tired of 9 or more months of heat (today is Oct 2 and the temp goes from 67 to 91F), and Texas politics (we believe in women's and LGBTQIA+ rights). We visited Seattle during a Thanksgiving and really liked it. We also have friends there and both work in tech (we hope to bring our jobs with us remotely, but well, you know how that's going these days...).

The plan is for the kids to take a gap year working, then pick up college once we have established residency. We're looking in the Olympia/Tacoma areas to be closer to the water. Our daughter has a chronic lung condition that does markedly better when she's close to salt water/air.

I know this is a general question, but any general advice/tips? I've lived in NYC and California, and Texas is the state our kids grew up in. We're all keen to leave due to the reasons above. I've read in subs about how dark Seattle gets during the colder months and also how Seattle folks can be hesitant about new relationships. After 20 years of punishing sun I think I'd be fine with not seeing it for months at a time, and I'd hope we could find new community where we land. We're not church-going people, but love art, music, samba, coffee and food. I personally add ttrpg and biking to that list.

thoughts? thanks in advance!

I work in an office, and we had an important meeting with our department heads to discuss quarterly results. My boss was presenting from her laptop, and I was sitting next to her, eager to make a good impression. I had brought a large cup of coffee with me because it was an early meeting, and I needed the energy boost. Everything was going fine at first, but about halfway through, I reached for my coffee to take a sip, and that’s when disaster struck. As I put the cup back down, I misjudged the distance and knocked it over—right onto my boss’s laptop! The coffee spilled everywhere, soaking the keyboard, and the laptop immediately shut off. The room went silent as everyone stared at me in disbelief. My boss looked like she wanted to scream, but instead, she just calmly closed the lid and said, ""We’ll continue this later.""

I immediately apologized and offered to pay for the damages, but my boss didn’t say much. She just packed up her things and left the meeting. Now I’m sitting here in my cubicle, waiting to hear what’s going to happen. I’m absolutely mortified, and I’m terrified I’ve ruined my career over a stupid mistake.

1fujbdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1fujbdx/yes_were_having_an_ice_cream_party_my_cousin_is/,"Yes we're having an ice cream party, my cousin is dying","About 2 years ago my Cousin Kara died & to make it a bit easier on the kids we threw an ice cream party.

I know how bizarre and unhinged that sounds, but we had recently had a lot of family members die over the past few years and it was all weighing heavy on all our hearts to have one more go especially before her time.

We are also big believers on celebrating our loved ones and their lives. we still make time to cry and mourn but we do things we know they would have loved. I swear if my funeral isn't a big party I will haunt my children/siblings.

SOOOOO my mom calls to tell us Kara's been pronounced braindead and all the kids have been crying for about 2 days now worried sick about her. My mom comes up with the brilliant idea of getting all the kids together and having an ice cream social to bring their spirits up, and heck yea Kara would have loved that. 

My husband and i are the ones to go to the store to get all the ice cream, i look awful. I've been watching 8 kids for the past 2 days and it shows. i was so happy to go and get a break from them. I grab about 15 different ice cream flavors. Ones we love, fancy ones, new ones and about every topping in the aisle, like 3 kinds of cones too!! and i go to check out.

The line was longer than I liked but it was the weekend, some Karen gets behind me immediately and i can hear her whisper to her husband. I can't make out much of what she says but i do hear ice cream so i assumed she was just ya know pointing it out to her husband to look. no big deal, I'd probably do the same if i saw someone grab half of the ice cream aisle. I did notice she was doing it the entire time we we're waiting.

It's finally my turn and i'm being rung out. The cashier says something about ohhh i must really be craving some ice cream and i made some stupid joke about it being gone in one sitting. VERY VERY obvious it was a bad joke, if you could even call it that lol. 

AND the Karen decides to speak up finally saying how im letting myself go, my body is a temple and i should nurture it with nutritious foods. My boyfriend is going to leave me blahblahblah. 

I turn to her and say 'we just got the news my cousin is dead, we're throwing an ice cream party'. No other context no nothing just a big smile on my face, then back to a completely straight face. I seriously must have looked demented or something. She just stared at me with her mouth open. She doesn't say anything else the entire time, we pay & leave.

My husband bursts out laughing when we get to the car. He swears up and down to this day i said My cousin is finally dead but i don't remember saying it that way... He also said the cashier went wide eyed when i said that. 

We get home and we had a great time!! I took a shower felt much better :) looked better too. The Kids really enjoyed the ice cream party, we dressed all the kids up and put on a movie. I think it was the labyrinth and then the dark crystal since Kara loved those movies. I finally got to try pistachio ice cream and had this fancy coffee kind where the cream was coffee brewed it was divine :9 my new favorite!

LOVE YOU KARA! you would have loved this coffee ice cream! When I eat it I think about you <3

1fujamq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1fujamq/update_on_olive_oil_and_ibs/,Update on Olive Oil and IBS,"A few months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1ek4k05/olive_oil_and_my_ibs/) about how olive oil changed my IBS. Since then, I've had some people try it out. 

Taking olive oil may help you. It has helped me, and others. But it may also have undesirable or mixed results too. My personal experience is that it has reduced my IBS by a large margin. It has effectively removed my pain and discomfort. But I still have a few issues, namely feeling sick in cars. I also am triggered by things like coffee and garlic. 

The other people I asked to try it out have had mixed results. One of them has had success with it, the other is uncertain if it has helped them. The first person reported that their pain/discomfort has gone away, but the olive oil exacerbated their constipation, which I have also experienced. The other person is uncertain of whether or not the oil has helped them, due to numerous unrelated reasons. Other people have reported it working for them too, but not enough information has come of that. 

This may be a treatment for IBS, so I will describe how one should take it: After waking up, you should take 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and wait 15-30 minutes before consuming anything else, even water. The longer you wait the better. The process may take weeks for you to see significant change. Do not consume food with olive oil for your first meal, or you will regret it. Eating olives does not have the same effect and may even worsen the situation. 

You should use Cento, as that is effective for me and some other people. Other olive oils I have used made me feel worse, have no effect, or are inferior in effect. Pompeii olive oil made me feel worse. If you want to and are able to experiment with different oils, please do so. 

Certain foods and drinks like coffee and garlic may resume your IBS even with the oil, and so may stress. Being in a car or other triggers may still resume IBS for you. 

**Take at your own risk.** For some people, this may worsen your IBS, especially with IBS-D. I cannot guarantee that this will solve or better your problems. This is what has worked for me, and others. But this likely varies from person to person, and there may be side effects. Do not take if pregnant or if you have something else. You could be taking a large risk by doing this. But you may also change your life for the better. ",0,1727883792.0,ibs,0,0.5,False

I didn't consume that much in the last decade but recently started adding milk to my coffee. I started getting full blown anaphylaxis (not shock), low body temperature, blurry vision, dizziness, tired, low BP, slow beating heart. I was confused... have I started reacting to coffee as well via MCAS? No, it's the milk.

So I did this experiment:

1. I drank a bit of milk and got myself sick > mast cells have histamine receptors and they get *sensitized* by histamine itself
2. A few hours later while sick (lethargic, tired), I ate some chicken thighs which are usually ok > 15 minutes later, I started getting racing thoughts, fast pounding heart, bad mood, feels like I drank 20 coffees. This was because of (I'm pretty sure) point 1

I'm posting this because someone (like me) might consume a food he's become allergic to and thinking it's MCAS instead of an actual IgE food allergy. And not to mention, why we have different reactions to the same food.",12,1727883788.0,MCAS,3,0.93,False

I am also a fulltime mom of 4 kids, 2 cats, 1 dog and millions of bees.

I start my morning by walking a trail close to my house with my eldest kids, I believe health and movement is key to a healthy body and since I have been neglecting it for such a long time, I made the commitment in 2024 that I will hit that 10 000 steps everyday and walking in nature just re-energises you and breaks off all the stress. I also get to spend time with my older kids and this is a growth moment for them as I share learnings from my life with them.

If this is the first time seeing my video, welcome to my Apiary, my name is Marnie. I am a beekeeper here in the beautiful country of South Africa, the home of the amazing African honey bees. I started beekeeping about 2 years ago and today I boast with over 50 hives bred from buying one hive and catching some swarms.

I love good quality coffee and having a nice good cup of coffee with raw unfiltered honey is amazing before I jump away with my daily beekeeping activities. I have switched to raw unprocessed honey for over 2 and half years now and my digestive system has never been better.

One of the main reasons for becoming a beekeeper is making my own honey that is raw and unprocessed. I wanted a source that is clean and authentic. I was also drawn to the call for helping the pollinators to heal our world.

Being a small business I understand the importance of supporting each other, on my way to my apiary I love to stop and grab my breakfast on the go from the roadside food trucks. My favourite food cart is definitely Roosterkoeke, I love the taste and that everything is handmade. This morning I chose the babotie roosterkoek as I love the mince that has a little sweet taste with the fresh roosterkoek bread.

At the Apiary I just need to refill the sugar water on each hive and just check the splits I did about a week and half ago. I also want to introduce you to my oldest hive here, yes they are my oldest hive but they are also my most defensive hive.

This is the hive that made me a beekeeper, my dad bought me this hive and we had to travel over an hour and half to go and fetch this box. I was so scared to transport them as I only had a enclosed vehicle. For that matter I did not even have a suit at that point. I just brought them home, placed them on the stand and ran my butt of when I opened the hive entrances. In my defence I had ordered a suit it had not arrived yet.

My kids named the queen - Queen Juliet, she is a nice big fat brown queen and she is very productive. Although they are very defensive, they are very productive. I use them to build out empty frames of comb to help other colonies. They also help out with brood and nursing bees if another colony needs it. I have turned them into a brood factory due to their massive productiveness.

This hive is over 5 years old, they were requeened just before I got them so Queen Juliet is about 2 years old. She has made 3 queens in the past but they have since been re-queened with calmer queens.

When I got this colony in the beginning there were only 4 frames of bees and there comb was awe full, just before I went to go and fetched them the beekeeper was robbed and about half of his hives were vandalised, the beekeeper was able to recover them and they were a colony the size of my hands. I took Queen Juliet about 8 months to recover her losses and now she is boasting a double brood box, that is 20 frames of bees and they are currently filling their super as we speak. I am very excited to harvest from them this year as this will be their first honey crop that I get to keep. I refused to harvest from them as I wanted them to grow strong as they were the backbone of my apiaries growth. I cannot tell you how many hives they have saved by supplying them with resources.

I do not graft from this colony at all and if I do split them I will just create another brood factory. I was planning on splitting them this year and increase the amount of brood factories I have on hand, I am sure you are really confused with what a brood factory is, in simple terms it is a hive that you build up for resources. Instead of letting the hives defend for themselves and letting survival of the fittest reign. You rather setup a brood factory with extra resources to boost colonies that need it. I believe my brood factories was the corner stone of my success as I always had additional resources available when I needed it.

My best advice I would give anyone wanting to start with beekeeping is to jump into the deep end. There is more than enough information online to get you started and the only way you will learn is by doing. The more you do the more you grow. I am the beekeeper I am today because of my bees, it is not the beekeeper that makes the bees. It is the bees that make the beekeeper.

Thank you for supporting my journey, If you are interested in some of the products I make or maybe you want to start your own beekeeping journey then please check out my website and I would love to be part of your beekeeping with my online courses.

Greetings from Spain in my first post on Reddit!  
  
I'm writing because I have a lot of doubts about what my next coffee machine should be.  
  
I currently have a Breville Barista Pro. At first, I liked it, but I’m liking it less and less, and it's also given me some problems.  
  
I tried the older Rocket Appartamento for two weeks, and I really liked the quality of the coffee. The E61 group is not an issue for me since I use a Wi-Fi plug and keep it scheduled.  
  
In Spain, there isn’t much variety when it comes to machines, and my budget is under 1500 €. I managed to see the Mara X, the Profitec Pro 400, and the TCA in a store. I originally had the TCA in mind, but I really liked the 400—it seemed very high-quality. The salesperson even told me it was better than the TCA in terms of build and reliability.  
  
One thing I don’t like about the TCA is that I think it still comes with the standard 12-14 bar pressure, compared to the 9 bars of the Profitec. But I do love the matte black design of the TCA.  
  
The Lelit Mara X caught my attention for how compact it is, but in person, it felt like it had much lower build quality than the other two. I always read good things about that model, but seeing the three together, it’s the one that impressed me the least. So, in that sense, someone would have to convince me.  
  
Thanks a lot, and I hope I can make up my mind soon!",2,1727883703.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

trigger warning: pet euthanasia 

I had to take my animal to the vet 6 days ago and my 5 yr old was along for the journey. I asked my mum to come too, so as i had someone there to mind him while i went through the euthanasia process witt the vet. 

During the period of my pet being taken away to insert drip etc, I opened the consult door to check on  my son. She then proceeded to complain about being hungry, my child being hungry etc. I mentioned that we were 30mins from home max and that i could make something once we were home. She wanted to go for a walk to check for food up the street. I watched my son while she went. She came back and stated “nothing just coffee and some muesli crap” and then was like “what’s going on, how long is it taking?” as though she had places to be and it was dragging on. 

We also had to stop off for food on the drive home, “the pet will be ok in the car won’t they” which def really fucking horrible but i just gritted my teeth and pushed through it. While in the fast food place was told “i’ll get mine and you get yours and childs food” 

 On the way home I had asked her to help me bury the pet, digging the hole etc. I specifically wanted to use a particular garden shovel to make it easier to dig, she flat out refused as this didn’t suit her (not sure why).

then once i got home in the driveway she said “are you relieved you did that now” and i just snapped and told her i could tell she doesn’t really want to help out/be here and to go home if she feels that way. She got out of the car, said “bye” and i haven’t heard from her for six days. 
I did send a message that afternoon and just said “i had to put an animal down today and i didn’t appreciate you making it about how hungry you were etc, and a bit of grace given during the day would’ve been nice” she’s just ignored it, not responded and basically hasn’t spoken to me at all since. 

Note: Pet was a bird that was very very old and I discovered it had a tumour at the appt, I thought it was potentially an unfixable slipped tendon but abdomen tumour putting pressure on leg. Although not utterly distressed by having to euthanise my pet, as she was old and id give. her a really good life, i was still pretty upset deep down as i loved my bird and it’s a hard decision to have to make as a pet owner.

Wasn't perfect, and I am not very good at picking out flavors, but it was enjoyable. I thought it was more acidic and sweet than I normally get, usually I taste the bitterness predominantly, which was good since I was trying to get more sweetness out of my coffee.

Anyway, this morning I made a cup, and it was very sour, not really enjoyable at all. I used the [coffee compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/) and found that the sweetness/acidity of the day prior indicated more over extracted coffee, while the sourness of today indicated under extracted coffee. But I kept everything the exact same: same water, same temp, same ratio, same grind size, same recipe/pour, etc. I'm wondering why I would have two such wildly different experiences day to day when I kept everything the same.

Probably an unanswerable question, but if anyone had any thoughts I'd appreciate it.",3,1727882626.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

Nick and I have been friends for almost 2 years (about a year and 9 months), we met a month after I turned 18 and he was 21 and we started talking on social media bc of a group chat of people who were going to start going to law school.

We had a great friendship for about a year and a half, I always listened to him about his problems about missing his mom and little brother (they live about 7-8 hours away), feeling alone, problems with a girl he dated for a few months, work stuff, etc. while he gave me a lot of emotional support to feel safe around men after my last relationship was with someone abusive and things with my family were shitty and I worked two jobs while starting a career. We connected emotionally through supporting each other and we have a lot of interest in common like videogames we play together, music and going out sometimes.

He confessed his love to me in march, and I rejected him for like 3 or 4 months bc I was scared to ruin our friendship and not wanting to suffer abuse again, but with a lot of his effort for showing me I can feel safe around him I decided to accept my feelings and date. Almost every day during those 3-4 months he gave me chocolates, letters, visit me after work or invite me to dates, so I totally fell for him.

now we've been together for a bit over 3 months, pretty new relationship. And I feel life is getting hard for him.

We're from South America. He recently, about two months ago, moved out (he used to live with two roommates that he didn't felt confortable with since the house was always a mess when he came back from work) so he's now renting a 1 room apartment. He's happy about it and feels independent, but he's worried about now being able to maintain that lifestyle.
He earns about $300000-$400000 a month of our currency (about $230-$307 dollars) and his rent + taxes like electricity, water, etc is about $150000 (about $115 dollars). My income isn't pretty high either, I earn about $200000-$500000 ($153-$384) depending on sales since currently I'm only an entrepreneur bc I left my second job to focus on my grades, even if we don't live together since I go to his apartment on the weekends i try to help.

I pay for some food (like pasta, rice, veggies, condiments, etc), cook for us and try to leave some made food for him so he can have something to eat before or after going to work, wash dishes, pay for some of our dates (like going out for coffee or ice cream, or getting something for us to have breakfast at college) and try giving house stuff to him as gifts (like some decoration stuff he told me he would like to get, cups, bowls, etc). I know it's not much but he doesn't want me to pay for stuff that are his responsibility (I offered to pay for electricity or give him a bit of money for rent).

Nick told me he's feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything and wants to drop out of college since he doesn't like law and only studied it for his parents and that he could use that time to work more hours or get a second job. One of his friends came from his city (7-8 hours away) to stay at his apartment without telling him and he's staying for two weeks and even invites his girlfriend to stay there some days, Nick doesn't know how to tell his friend that he doesn't feel confortable and that 3 people in a 1 room apartment is sofocating to him after working 8 hours and that he just wants to be alone at his own home. His mom now is asking him for money ($130000, about $100 dollars) bc she reserved a family vacation that he has to go in a few days and he doesn't know if he's going to have the money to pay for it and he's also helping his dad to pay debt he has everytime his dad ask him to.

I just want to know if there's anyway for me to help him a little. 

Last night his friend made a mess at his house, lost the keys Nick gave him and invited the girlfriend without letting Nick know. He was super stressed since after work all he wanted was to sleep since he's about 12 hours out of his house (going to work takes him almost 2 hours, worked 8 and going back home almost another 2 hours). His friend also went through his computer to check something about the wifi or something like that and somehow deleted a password (all passwords in general) he had to a bank account and now he can't access money he needed to pay for bills (electricity and gas) so now he's worried about that too.

I suggested that maybe he needs to go to therapy again since he's so overwhelmed (I offered to pay for it, since I want to see him better/happier) and to try to talk about this things that bother him to his friend (about putting limits, like letting him know when he needs to stay the next time, how many days and to ask for permission to invite people). I also offered to pay for the services of this month ($42000, about $32 dollars) but he told me he didn't wanted to have to ask me about money for that kind of things, so last night I sent him a bit of money for dinner or whatever and this morning I invited him out to get coffee and gave him some chocolates he likes

Is there any way I can help him? I know living totally by yourself while working, studying, taking courses and trying to have a social life is hard and I want to support him as much as possible.

He says all he needs is talking with me and feeling loved, and thanks me for being at his side when he's not at his best. but I would like to do more than that if it's possible.",1,1727882266.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
