1g6zbcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1g6zbcx/my_very_small_history_with_plaque_psoriasis/,My (very) small history with plaque psoriasis,"How it started: last april a mosquito bite got infected. Stupid me, ""too busy"" to go to doc. Got to a point where brown liquid was coming out. Then started to heal. But then, plaque psoriasis started to appear around the bite, then slowly covered all my legs. And now im covered up to the shoulders. Hopefully it wont go up my face. According to dermatologist, its often triggered by strepto bacteria. So thats probably the infection i had.

To try to help: stopped alcohol, coffee, and focused on a more plant based diet. No improvements.

Dermatologist's 1st treatment was pretty basic cortisone cream. Did for 2 weeks. No improvements.

2nd treatment was a little stronger cream: betamethasone. I started to see improvements, but feels like my body just got accustomed to it, and stopped having any effects.

3rd treatment: phototherapy. Thing is, i live far from the dermatologist and needed to go there 3 times a week. So he decided to skip this one.

4th treatment: soriatane, taken orally. Started today. This gets stronger. Theres recurrent blood tests during the 4 months of this treatment. Hair loss, skin becoming very dry.

If it doesnt work...

5th treatment would be a pill that suppresses parts of the immune system.

6th treatment would be an injection. 

Now, i havent had this for years, so with the little glimpse i have, i cant imagine if you are stuck with this for a long time. It does afffect my morale. Im also extremely lucky to not have to pay for all this.

Hoping that it can help people navigate through the different possible treatments.

1g6zahc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1g6zahc/vent_i_feel_like_im_fighting_a_losing_battle_feat/,VENT: I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle: feat. PCOS & IBS C,"I was diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I had hirsutism, amenorrhoea (3 periods last year and 1 this year), bad cystic acne and chronic IBS-C. I have high androgens but no ovarian cysts. By far my most frustrating symptom is chronic constipation. If I don’t take laxatives I could go 5 days without passing a bm. I have to take polyethylene glycol daily in order to stay somewhat regular. The stomach distension and bloating make me look pregnant. I end up feeling very “full”, but never have the urge.

The only recommendation my first GP had was to take laxatives. I am in my 20’s and do not like the idea of just taking laxatives forever as a “solution” to this problem. I wanted to get to the root of it. He had no other offerings for me. I switched GPs and upon the discussion of my PCOS, asked earnestly “why would you want a period?” Like are you kidding me? I was adamant about getting a referral to a gyno, so she gave me one. 

I saw the gyno who encouraged birth control. I was very hesitant because I really don’t like the idea of taking more hormones. I read the book by Lara Bryden which is adamant that birth control messes up your system. Alas- I submitted due to the endometriosis risk. I’m not really sure how this sub feels about the book, but I guess it didn’t really help me much either. I ended up compromising on SLYND because it’s an anti-androgen and had good reviews from some reddit cysters (thank you). It cleared my acne and I don’t seem to have any side effects. 

This year I started a low fodmap over the course of 5 or so months with a dietician. It seemed to help a bit with the bloating, however the constipation remained more or less the same. I continue to eat low fodmap. I eat mostly vegetarian and recently introduced fish. I drink lots of water, and take probiotics, vit D, omega 3, B12 and vit C.  

I started taking dihydroberberine 3 times a day which suppressed my appetite and reduced bloating. I ended up losing 5 lbs. My bmi is currently 22.

Then alas in mid August I was blessed by the motility gods and spontaneously from August 24th-October 1st my constipation was gone… I felt like a completely new person. I got a taste of life on the other side. I could not believe how much not being constipated improved my mental health. 

On October 1st it got bad again. And not just like a little bad but VERY bad. I’ve become obsessive about “what it could be” that temporarily fixed my digestion:

My hypotheses:

* I took a tolerance break from dihydroberberine around Aug 29th for two weeks. I stopped taking it again a couple days ago to test but nothing changed
* My caffeine and dark chocolate intake increased around October so I was thinking that perhaps my cortisol increased from the caffeine? I am currently experimenting with cutting coffee (horrible) and chocolate to see if I notice a difference

My stress levels are actually comparatively pretty low right now then before August. So what is it?? I feel a bit like that character in “Under the Silver Lake” who is nuts and trying to unscramble the children’s maze on the side of the old cereal box. 

Today I noticed that my hair is thinning a lot which drove me to write this dissertation of self pity.

If anyone has any advice PLEASE let me know. These symptoms are seriously impacting my mental health. I am feeling very alone because it has been such a battle to get a doctor to take me seriously.

**TLDR: AGONY**

I’ve tried everything (I think) Exercise/pillows/pills/distractions the only thing that seems to work is  propanol and trazodone. Melatonin gets me sleep but I’m not really down with taking pills all the time. That’s never been me. I currently today have made the switch to cbd and cannabis products. 

I recently switched jobs. From being a local sort supervisor at ups (5-10pm) to a Caltrans landscape maintenance worker. (6am-3pm) I hated it. My sleep problem came up there about the third week in. I would close my eyes but I just wouldn’t fall asleep. This persisted for about a month. I was completely exhausted all day at work. 

I had a short attention span and my muscles hurt. Then the second month came around and that’s when the shaking started I would now be awake and shake. It was the worst. (The shaking has since gone away) Now sometimes I get heat flashes. That I combat with a wet towel. I quit Caltrans but it’s still happening!! 

I’ve seen a doctor, I’ve done labs and everything seems fine.  I’ve several therapist and they tell me it’s anxiety (duh) but I thought it would go away after a couple of days not keep going. I cut the problem out so I don’t see what the problem is. Most night now I only get about 4 hours ish of sleep. It sucks . It just feels like fight or flight mode constantly and exhausting. I’m Agitated and on edge but overall exhausted. When I lay down and begin to try and sleep my body doesn’t seem to want to click over to rest-full dream state. It’ll sometimes jerk itself awake. I absolutely hate this. (It’s almost like saying no you don’t deserve this)
Sometimes I’ll just sit there and listen to my heart beat. It even hurts sometimes when I wake up. 


I used to drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks and I was fine. I was weening down gradually to about one a day. I’m currently still at that. 

I’m hoping other people have gone through this that can guide me in the right direction for treatment. I feel like a shell of a person when I used to be really fun and happy go lucky. 

Please anything helps. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope.

When she woke, the string of memory clung to her like the Olden’s sap. Confused at her surroundings, feeling out of place and adrift, it took a precious long time before she came fully to herself to rise from the depths of Sil’s bed. Instead of the tense season of running from the Protector’s domain, she was in a safe, soft bed, feeling very much like she did not deserve the sleep. Oh well.

The longer she played Tianna, the more her old memories and questions returned to plague her. Maybe she was slipping too far into her old self. Sarrinare laughed her braying laughter in her ear as Mertle splashed cold water onto her face.

She had intended for a quick nap to recover some of her strength before heading out, as would befit the haggard Tianna. Instead, she’d missed the day. Coffee waited for her, stone cold on the table. Still, shame to waste it.

The enchantment held, her armlet’s hot to the touch and its runes glowing faintly in the early-evening gloom. Three, maybe four bells left before the glamour began fading. With little heart for it, she dressed and headed back out into the cold. Every step forward helped Tianna reassert herself in her bones and the cobwebs of old memory fade.

Lucian… how to play Lucian tonight? A cautious snake at the best of times, the man could give an aelir’matar reason to be wary. Always poking. Always prodding. Always bloody inferring secrets from every little thing she said or did. And that infuriating half-smile of his that neither confirmed or denied a single word coming out of his mouth.

How Sil could deal with him and not punch the sleaze, Mertle couldn’t begin to imagine.

And now she had little time for his games. To give in and play them altogether was to tumble headfirst down a very steep incline with a lot of jagged bits at the bottom. If she allowed him a moment’s control of the conversation—

Someone grabbed her arm and roughly yanked her sideways. A kick to her feet scythe them out from under her and she found herself down in dirty snow, in a foul smelling alley. A knife pressed to her neck and a hand covered her mouth. Calloused. Rough. Smelling of soap.

“Search her,” a hushed voice—a man’s hushed voice—commanded to someone to the side.

Other rough hands dug under her coat and cloak to grope at her and ransacked her pockets. Her arms, however, they left free.

Sloppy work.

A knife slipped into her palm from her sleeve. The man atop her was too confident that a blade at her throat was enough to keep her docile. She’d been too involved in her own thoughts, too drawn out and fuzzy with poor sleep, or else some common thieves wouldn’t have gotten the drop on her.

If she cut this oaf’s throat, that would lead to questions when she showed up covered in blood at the Guild. It might give Lucian some pause, now she thought of it.

Cut a throat in Valen, and sooner or later the city’s constabulary came around asking questions and looking very interested at a lot of things they shouldn’t be interested in. She’d need to kill all of these men. Unfortunately, she doubted there were only the two on her.

One slash upwards cuts the hand’s tendon. A second slashed the man across the face as he reeled back. A kick out got her out from the second’s attention. If they’d wanted her dead, they would’ve cut her throat prior to stealing her valuables.

No, this was well-thought out, so she had some heartbeats before their intentions turned bloody.

In a scrabble, she got to her feet and kicked out the bleeding man. Her boot caught him in the mouth just as he drew breath to shout. It toppled him back, at least some teeth knocked down his throat.

A glance around showed two… no, three more men. They’d dragged her into the narrow gap between two buildings, grabbed off the side street she’d been using to move easier between Valen’s layers. Thuggish. Large and brawny. One of them pulled back his bleeding friend.

Entrance covered expertly by two of them. The one groping her had pulled out his knife but hadn’t come forward. Stumbling slightly, the bleeding man came to his feet and brandished a cudgel in his good hand. Odd that. They were all slow to cuss at her and demand she hand over her weapon. If anything…

They were waiting for something different.

There was none of the bluster of thugs cornering and outnumbering prey. If anything, they were more wary of her now, much more than warranted.

Her eyes met hard, disciplined stares. No panic or hesitation there. She’d ran with plenty of thugs and bandits to know when something stank. Either she’d run into into the most brazen thieves in Valen, or these men weren’t what they appeared to be.

*I’m being tested,* she realised with a jolt. For what?

…For fire.

Mertle broken into cold sweat as realisation dawned. They were spread out and advanced on her cautiously, expecting fire and ready to react to it. They’d known exactly who and, more importantly, what they were assaulting.

“Do you have the barest idea of who you’ve laid hands on?” she blurted out, bluster trying to hide the growing panic she felt. She drew herself out of the half-crouch, mimicking a pyromancer’s straight-backed stance. “Of what I could do to you?”

Far chance of them backing down. If anything, now they leered. These weren’t thugs. These were soldiers, now growing confident that she wouldn’t be able to back up her threats.

Maybe she could take all four with two knives. Maybe. A quick glance up showed they were hidden completely beneath the interlocking eaves of the buildings, in the rain gutter. If someone were observing, it couldn’t be too closely. If she cut their throat and set them ablaze somehow, then maybe it could pass for a pyromancer’s work.

Even she knew that wouldn’t be the case.

Her second knife dropped in her off-hand. Nothing for it then. Her cover would be as good as blown now that she’d failed the most basic test for a pyromancer. Best to kill the oafs and then see if she could manage the passage to the shop. From there, she and Tummy could probably make it out of Valen before the Guard came in force for them.

So much for the captain’s assurances and apologies. How she’d wish she could knock out that flint-eyed cunt’s teeth.

No reason to fear for her life. If she were an impostor, then their orders would likely be to bring her in for some real questions. She could fight, at least for a time, with no care for life or limb. She could down one before they judged her dangerous enough to take seriously.

In the gutter there was only room for two of them to advance at once. And they were unimpressed of her bluster. She would at least make them regret the temerity.

Before either of the two made up their mind, she lunged at the closest. One knife flashed up towards his wrist, the other aimed at the throat. A clean, quick kill if he were careless.

The man exploded before her knife rose in the killing arc. In the dark of the alley, the explosion blinded her and the backwash of searing heat sent her reeling. The soldier was blasted off his feet and thrown bodily against the wall to slide with a wet crunch of snapping bones.

Her eyebrows were singed off and her face hot and tender.

The second tried rushing her. Or maybe he was trying to get to his companion. Mertle reacted on instinct and kicked out, aiming through the blobs of after-flash for his groin. Fire erupted beneath the man to throw him out of the alley with a detonating crack like thunder. He crashed through the eaves above. A torrent of debris rained down on Mertle’s head.

Before she fully regained her sight from the flashes of light, the other two were gone, melted out into the night. Only the burned ones were left behind, both crumpled against walls, moaning in pain. The stench of burnt hair hung in the air.

Fire had kissed her as well and she could feel skin blistering on her fingers where the blast had been closest. People crowded at the mouth of the gutter, drawn by the spectacle.

Mertle drew herself up as the first muttered questions arose. Concerned voices. Someone calling out for a healer. Others for the constabulary.

She patted down the smoking patches of her dress and hair and stumbled out of the dark to meet the onlookers.

“Will someone get the guard, please?” she asked in her best and most annoyed Tianna voice. “Before I get a mind to finish these scum off?”

Someone from the gathering crowd peeled quickly away, without raising any alarm or calling out. Mertle got a glimpse of them rushing away without a glance back. In the direction of the elevators, towards the Fortress.

Others asked if she was alright. She shrugged away their concern and sneered.

“Perfectly fine. Get away from me.” She spat some blood on the ground. Must’ve bit the inside of her cheek when knocked down. “I expected Valen be more civilised. Filth dragging respectable women in the gutter? Disgusting.” A well aimed kicked at the first man got him stirring. “See to them, will you? I don’t need their kind of blood on my hands.”

After all, they were only soldiers doing their job.

With another sniff of annoyance, she pushed through the crowd and walked away, still aware that she was smoking from some smouldering patch of her dress. It would leave an impression.

She’d been seen. She’d been heard.

Best she were somewhere else before anyone came through asking unpleasant questions that would eat up whatever time she had left of the enchantment.

And best she tried to figure out why two men exploded out of the blue. She suspected Sil’s bracelet, but that made very little sense. If anyone could figure out how to trap offensive channelling into an item, they’d buy an empire.

She threw one final glance over her shoulder and thought she recognized a face in the crowd, half-lit by spritelight. No, not the face. The knot where the stranger’s arm was missing. It was gone in a moment, onlookers rushing to help the hurt *thieves.*

# The Importance of SEO for Small Businesses

In today’s digital landscape, search engine optimization (SEO) is not just a luxury; it’s a necessity for small businesses aiming to thrive. Without a strong online presence, even the most exceptional products or services might go unnoticed.

SEO enhances visibility in search engine results, which directly correlates with increased website traffic and potential sales. When customers search online for products or services, they typically engage with the top results. Thus, being on that first page can significantly boost a small business’s credibility and brand recognition. Moreover, SEO is a cost-effective marketing strategy, especially for small businesses with limited budgets. Unlike traditional advertising methods, which can be expensive and often provide variable returns, SEO focuses on attracting organic traffic.

This means that once a website is optimized, it can continue to draw visitors over time without the need for ongoing paid advertising. This sustainability is a game-changer for small enterprises that need to maximize their marketing spend.

Furthermore, effective SEO strategies help small businesses to better understand their target audience. By analyzing search patterns and user behavior, businesses can tailor their offerings to meet the specific needs of potential customers. This not only improves the likelihood of conversions but also fosters customer loyalty. In a competitive market, having insight into what drives customer decisions can set a small business apart from its competitors.

# Understanding the Basics of SEO

SEO encompasses various techniques and practices aimed at improving a website’s ranking in search engine results. At its core, it involves optimizing both the content and structure of a website to make it more appealing to search engines like Google. Understanding the fundamentals of SEO is crucial for small business owners who wish to implement effective strategies. One of the key components of SEO is keyword optimization. This involves identifying the phrases and terms that potential customers are searching for and incorporating them into website content. The right keywords can drive relevant traffic to a site, increasing the likelihood of attracting interested customers. However, it’s not just about stuffing keywords into content; it’s about integrating them naturally to enhance user experience. Additionally, SEO involves technical aspects such as site speed, mobile-friendliness, and secure connections. A website that loads quickly and is optimized for mobile users not only improves user satisfaction but also ranks better in search engine results. Search engines prioritize websites that provide a seamless experience for users, making technical SEO an essential aspect that small businesses cannot afford to overlook.

# Keyword Research and Analysis

Keyword research is the backbone of any successful SEO strategy. It involves identifying the words and phrases that potential customers use to find products or services online. By understanding these keywords, small businesses can create content that meets the needs of their target audience. There are various tools available, such as Google Keyword Planner and SEMrush, that can assist in discovering relevant keywords and assessing their search volume and competition.

Once a list of potential keywords is compiled, it’s essential to analyze their relevance and competitiveness. Long-tail keywords, which are more specific phrases typically consisting of three or more words, can be particularly valuable for small businesses. These keywords may have lower search volumes but also face less competition, making it easier to rank for them. By targeting these long-tail keywords, small businesses can attract more qualified traffic and improve conversion rates. After selecting the right keywords, the next step is to integrate them into the website’s content. This includes using keywords in titles, headings, meta descriptions, and throughout the body of the content. However, it’s important to strike a balance; keyword stuffing can harm user experience and lead to penalties from search engines. Instead, the focus should be on creating high-quality, informative content that naturally incorporates the chosen keywords.

# On-Page Optimization Techniques

On-page optimization refers to the various elements within a website that can be adjusted to improve its ranking in search engine results. This includes everything from meta tags and headings to the content itself. A well-optimized page not only appeals to search engines but also provides a better experience for users. One of the most critical on-page elements is the title tag, which is the clickable headline that appears in search results. An effective title tag should incorporate primary keywords while being concise and compelling. Similarly, meta descriptions, which summarize the content of a page, should also include keywords and provide a clear call to action, encouraging users to click through to the site.

Another essential aspect of on-page optimization is the use of header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.). These tags help structure content, making it easier for both users and search engines to navigate the page. The H1 tag is typically reserved for the main title, while H2 and H3 tags can be used for subheadings. Properly organizing content with header tags enhances readability and improves SEO.

# Off-Page Optimization and Link Building

While on-page optimization focuses on elements within a website, off-page optimization refers to the actions taken outside of the website to enhance its visibility and credibility. One of the most effective off-page strategies is link building, which involves acquiring hyperlinks from other websites to your own. These backlinks act as endorsements, signaling to search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. Quality is more important than quantity when it comes to backlinks. Links from reputable websites in your industry carry more weight than links from less credible sources. Small businesses can start building links by creating high-quality content that others will want to reference and share. Guest blogging, participating in forums, and collaborating with other businesses are also effective strategies for acquiring backlinks. Social media presence plays a crucial role in off-page SEO as well. Sharing content on social platforms can drive traffic back to your website and increase visibility. Engaging with customers on social media not only helps build relationships but can also lead to organic backlinks as followers share your content with their networks. Consistency in posting and interaction is key to leveraging social media effectively for off-page optimization.

# Local SEO Strategies for Small Businesses

For small businesses, local SEO is particularly important as it helps attract customers within a specific geographic area. This strategy involves optimizing your online presence to ensure that your business appears in local search results. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by creating and optimizing a Google My Business (GMB) listing. This free tool allows businesses to provide essential information, such as their address, phone number, hours of operation, and website link.

Additionally, incorporating local keywords into your website content can significantly enhance local SEO. For example, instead of targeting generic keywords like “best coffee shop,” small businesses might target “best coffee shop in \[City Name\].” This specificity helps search engines understand the geographic relevance of the content and improves visibility for local searches.

Encouraging customer reviews and ratings is another powerful local SEO strategy. Positive reviews can enhance your business’s reputation and increase its chances of appearing in local search results. Responding to reviews, both positive and negative, shows prospective customers that you value feedback and are engaged with your clientele. This interaction not only builds trust but also signals to search engines that your business is active and relevant.

# Mobile Optimization and Responsive Design

With the increasing use of smartphones for online searches, mobile optimization has become a critical aspect of SEO. A responsive design ensures that a website adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal browsing experience for users. Search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their rankings, making it essential for small businesses to ensure their sites are mobile-optimized. To achieve mobile optimization, businesses should focus on several key elements. First, website loading speed is crucial; if a site takes too long to load, users are likely to abandon it. Compressing images, minimizing code, and leveraging browser caching can significantly improve loading times. Additionally, ensuring that buttons and links are easily clickable on smaller screens enhances user experience. Another important factor in mobile optimization is the use of concise, easy-to-read content. Mobile users often prefer quick, digestible information rather than lengthy paragraphs. Using bullet points, short sentences, and clear headings can make content more accessible and engaging for mobile readers. By prioritizing mobile optimization, small businesses can enhance user satisfaction and improve their search engine rankings.

# Content Marketing and SEO

Content marketing is an integral component of SEO and can act as a powerful tool for small businesses looking to improve their online presence. Creating high-quality, engaging content can attract visitors to the website, keep them engaged, and encourage them to convert into customers. Blogs, articles, infographics, and videos are just a few formats that can be utilized to share valuable information with the target audience. Consistency is key in content marketing. Regularly publishing fresh content not only keeps the audience engaged but also signals to search engines that the website is active. This can lead to improved rankings over time. Additionally, integrating relevant keywords into the content allows small businesses to optimize their articles for search engines, making it easier for potential customers to discover their offerings. Moreover, content marketing can facilitate link building. When high-quality content addresses specific problems or provides valuable insights, other websites are more likely to link to it as a reference. This not only improves SEO through backlinks but also establishes the business as an authority in its industry. By combining content marketing with SEO strategies, small businesses can amplify their online visibility and reach a wider audience.

# Measuring and Tracking SEO Success

To ensure that your SEO efforts are yielding positive results, it’s essential to measure and track performance. Various tools, such as Google Analytics and Google Search Console, provide valuable insights into website traffic, user behavior, and search engine rankings. By analyzing this data, small businesses can gauge the effectiveness of their SEO strategies and make informed adjustments as needed.

One of the key metrics to track is organic traffic, which refers to visitors arriving at the website through search engine results. An increase in organic traffic indicates successful SEO efforts, while a decline may signal that strategies need to be reevaluated. Additionally, monitoring bounce rates can provide insight into user engagement; a high bounce rate may suggest that visitors are not finding the content relevant or engaging.

Furthermore, tracking keyword rankings is crucial for understanding which terms are driving traffic to the website. By assessing which keywords perform well, small businesses can focus their efforts on optimizing content around those specific terms. Regularly reviewing and adjusting SEO strategies based on data analysis ensures that small businesses can stay competitive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

# Take Action and Unlock Your Small Business’s SEO Potential

Unlocking the potential of SEO for small businesses is not just about implementing a set of strategies; it’s about continuous learning, adaptation, and commitment. By understanding the importance of SEO, mastering the basics, and employing effective techniques such as keyword research, on-page and off-page optimization, and local SEO strategies, small businesses can significantly enhance their online presence. Investing time and effort into mobile optimization, content marketing, and tracking performance will further fortify a small business’s position in the digital marketplace. As the landscape of online search continues to evolve, staying informed and agile is crucial for success.

Now is the time to take action. Start implementing these affordable SEO strategies, and watch as your small business flourishes in the digital realm. With dedication and the right approach, the success you desire is within reach. Let your business shine online, attracting customers and generating revenue like never before.

1g6yzo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flirting/comments/1g6yzo2/need_help/,Need help!,"I recently started talking again with a guy I met at a guitar store last year. He works at the guitar store and helped me find my first electric guitar. The entire time, he was getting guitars for me, plugging it in the amp, and would show off by playing complex riffs and was super helpful. I was immediately attracted to him.

Since then, we haven’t met in person, but have been communicating online. He once told me that the color I was wearing looked great on me. To me that seems like flirting. But that was back in April, and we didn’t talk again until last week. (I was in a relationship and when he saw the message about the color looking good on me, he made me unfollow him. I’m no longer with him, hence why I refollowed him and reached out to apologize for unfollowing.) 

We’ve been talking every day since, and it’s all been pleasant and platonic. But I just keep getting flirty vibes. But I could also just be projecting what I /want/ him to be feeling onto his words. I actually ended up taking a virtual guitar lesson from him and I was super nervous, and ended up not fully retaining it after it ended. But he kept saying I was awesome and that I did really well and I’m a quick learner. TBH, I don’t need guitar lessons to learn how to PLAY guitar, but just to improve. When we finished the lesson, he said that he was sorry to hear about my breakup, but I told him it was no big deal. Right after that though, he said “but I’m glad we’re in contact again, vibing, and playing guitar.” I’m not sure if he was flirting, or just shifting the topic so that things wouldn’t be awkward. But after that, he invited me to meet his band at this local event for musicians. He was gonna be at the thing anyway, and he is most likely trying to build an audience for his new band, so again I can’t figure out if it was like a soft asking out or not. But We’re going to be doing lessons every week. I would prefer to do them in person, because he does do in person lessons, but I live over an hour away and I don’t have my license, only my permit. 

To try and get some more insight, I posted something of a thirst trap to my story. Like it was pretty obviously a thirst trap. He liked it, but didn’t reply. A different guy that recently slid into my dms liked it, but he replied with heart eyes. So obviously one feels more obvious than the other, so it makes me wonder if guitar guy just liked it to be nice, or as a friend hyping me up. (Also, I’m like 85% sure he’s had a gf at some point, so he definitely could be attracted to me, like he’s not gay.)

BUT… he’s been posting pics on his story of his drink at a coffee shop, but both times, there’s been another cup, and this most recent time, there were long-ish fingernails (no polish that I could see). However, he hasn’t tagged anyone, nor posted a picture of anyone’s face. Idk if he has any siblings, roommates, or friends that are girls. I guess I should learn more about him before trying to ask him out, but family doesn’t really come up when we’re talking.

Part of me worries that he could just be flirting with me to get me to pay for lessons. He’s a musician and plays a lot of gigs, so I’m sure he has natural charisma and charm from that as well. But he sent me a selfie while chatting with me for seemingly no real reason, so that kinda made me think it was flirty. He also was talking about his cat and said something about his cat being a ladies’ man, and I was tempted to say something flirty about HIM being the ladies’ man, but decided against it bc I really don’t want to make unwanted or unrequited advances. I’m contemplating just saying something like “i might be overthinking it, but are you flirting with me a little bit?” But if the answer is no, I don’t think I could handle the embarrassment of continuing to take guitar lessons, but I don’t want it to seem like I stopped taking lessons BECAUSE he doesn’t like me back.

Basically, pls give me advice. Also, I apologize for being so wordy. I’m a pretty anxious person and I’m not very good at explaining things in short terms. I know I should probably just wait and feel things out, but I have such a crush on this guy and I don’t want to wait too long bc he could definitely find someone else.",1,1729304539.0,Flirting,0,1.0,False

You wouldn’t stop and say, “actually bishop, I have not been eating meat sparingly.” And if you did, he’d say, “oh you’re fine, that doesn’t matter.”

What I mean is, obviously there are successful coffee shops all over the country. I'm thinking about opening up a place in an area of Seattle where there is no great shortage of coffee shops, but definitely demand. My plan would be to try to access a great amount of potential drive-by customers.  But there is no place to make it a drive-thru or have a line of cars, but there is a place where four or five cars could park out front fairly easily. My thought is either have people come in or perhaps offer car hop service for lack of a better term. It would be a fairly small place with maybe a few tables and a roll-up garage door that would open it up to the parking area. I would probably be doing it as a movable cart So it could even be put forward just inside the roll up door .

I know years ago there were plenty of shops where people would park like in a little strip mall and walk in and stand in line to get their drink and back in their car. But there's so many drive-throughs around I don't know if anyone cares to do that anymore. 

However, it's the main arterial into downtown and there's really only one Starbucks shop and drive-thru several miles up the road. After a couple of miles, upwind, there are some drive-throughs but there is a long stretch all the way into near North Seattle and downtown and through downtown to the south where there really isn't any alternative, and plenty of people who would be leaving their house and heading south without even passing the ones to the north. 

Point being, there's a long stretch with a lot of traffic and a lot of people going to work with no drive-through competition. 

So my thought is hit that morning traffic from maybe 6:30 or 7:00 till 11:00 and then run it for a few more hours or into the evening as a regular coffee shop. 

I know there are apps where people will order before they get there and go through a drive-thru based on their pre-order. I think those aren't too complicated to set up for a private business if you pay a little bit.  Probably even apps where you can pay that way and all you would have to do is hop out of your car and grab your drink or have somebody run your drink out to you. 

So I'm just wondering if anyone has a business like this or any experience or thoughts. My fear would be that that just is too much for people that are used to drive through, but, there aren't any other drive-throughs on this stretch heading south and it's all controlled access. I don't think there's any on the other side of the street either but if there are it wouldn't be easy to get to. And it's a very populous area with a lot of money and sophisticated urbanites that like good coffee. 

I've got coffee experience and my sister used to run a drive-thru and was a very skilled expert, so not to worry about making sure the product is good. Just wondering about business. Any thoughts appreciated.",2,1729304163.0,barista,3,1.0,False

Bought a 3.4oz ready, but now I realize how the first sprays are VERY alchol-y and the plum note is now really prevalent to my nose and I do not like it nearly as much. I think I am going to return the 3.4oz because I am not sure I like it anymore :( It kind of smells like sunscreen-gone-bad now.  Burberry Goddess- I like it some days when I sniff in the store, then I don't. I'm not a big fan of the lavender note and would like to avoid any lavender to be honest. I thought I'd love it since it has vanilla in every note but nope...
* **VS Bare Vanilla-** Love. Best body spray.
* **Kayali 28**- Not a fan AT ALL. I don't know if it's the musk or what, but I do not see how it's meant to be a perfumified version of Bare Vanilla by VS.
* **Ariana Cloud**- Not really a ""vanilla"", but this is the perfume I find myself liking the most at the moment. But I want something more vanilla that I can layer with vanilla everything.
* **VS Tease Creme Cloud**- This one is pretty nice but I feel again that the vanilla is lacking a bit. I like it for the most part though.
* **Skylar Vanilla Sky**- I do like this one, but maybe a bit less coffee.
* **Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth**- I love this one. I mean it's pretty much Warm Vanilla Sugar which is another favorite of mine! I just wish it lasted longer.

Anyways, recently was replied to for one of the applications I submitted at a small consulting firm. Its in a different field (hvac), it sounds like a genuinely more interesting job however reading the technical requirements most of it is stuff I have zero experience with. They sent me an email saying they unfortunately filled the position I applied for but we're down to ""meet and chat regardless of an opportunity"" if I wanted to and said they may have more positions in the early new year.

I've taken them up on the offer to meet thinking it would be a quick 15-30min chat however they scheduled a 60min meeting at a coffee shop.

Idk what happened to this community but the amount of people that criticizes things simply because they don't realise or understand them is so fkn draining, like I get that you're mad about recent pacing cause it's slow and I also think that G3 needs vacations, but some criticizm simply don't make sense, like the ppl complaining and saying that the flashbacks of the timeskip were bad and he shouldn't have done it seriously wtf ????

The only other time we had a timeskip was in the Forgotten Shore, at the time it was criticized and for good reasons ! It didn't change anything and the narration became frustrating because the flashback was very long so it just felt like the timeskip was unecessary but this time it's literally the contrary. 

This time the timeskip is 4 years not 4 months !
The flashbacks are a good reason for Sunny and Cassie to interact with each other so that's already very good for the sense of the story. 
The first flashback is about Sunny killing the winterbeast which was something that everyone waited since the end of Antartica, this flashback is short and not that important but the flashback format made it good for a very simple reason : it sped up things.
People wanted Sunny to kill the winterbeast and thanks to the flashback we rushed to the fight so it was fire, with the normal pacing it would have so much slower and frustrating, so first flashback good !.

The second flashback is the one I really wanna talk about here.
The second flashback of Vol 8 is for me one of the best moment in all of SS and easily the best moment/element of V8 (yes way better than Sunphis).
The reason as to why ? It's very simple, you make the speed up effect once again and add to it peak fiction and there you go you got that flashback ;
In this flashback we see Sunny still devastated from being forgotten by everyone, he is very clearly depressed and doesn't really know what to do after having killed the winterbeast, the only thing he knows is that he does not want to stay in real life so he runs away from reality by staying in the dream realm, we already saw that before but Sunny is completely back to how he was at the start of the novel, his situation is also back to how it was as he has no link to any other human. 
We then get some of the best lore drops and crazy revelations of the novel as we get the rest of Weaver's lineage parts AND a lore drop about what ""Nothing"" and ""Nobody"" is what and what it did (when you realise the concept for the first time while reading the weird sentences it was so surreal lol). You also realise that it explains some stuff and especially was foreshadowed with Mordret from the start (Prince of Nothing and the fact that he was a creature of nothing in the 2nd nightmare).
After those revelations, Sunny decides to go through the hollow mountains, there he sees ""nothing"" and ""nobody"" and understands why it's called ""Hollow mountain"", Sunny is also depressed and suicidal, so he goes through nothing that might kill him, it is a parralel to his 1st nightmare as Sunny has the same mentality, the same situation, is depressed and suicidal once again and although it almost seemed like his end when going in nothing, he pushes through and finds it within him to not abandon yet (like in 1st NM), he realises that if he is nothing once again he can become whatever he wants and that he really does exist with pain as it's proof. After that, 1,5 years in the hollow mountains where he just hide, survive and kill monsters and finally we get to the other side which is FS, he is finally back to FS after so many years and there we see some stuff ; Sunny kills the Tree which was one of the most waited moments of the novel by the fans, then we learn that the Black sea is actually a nightmare creature. We also have Sunny celebrating his anniversary and drinking coffee (classic parralel in SS, you love to see it) that day he kills the tree and remembers about what he said in the chapter 70 something which was that in the future he would never be afraid again and 1700 chapters later he made it !
Later we get Sunny wandering in the dream world while realising he feels more at ease there than in the real world, you might think he just says so cause he is now a Saint but I think it is more tied to the fact that Sunny becomes a literal Daemon and that Sunny never fitted in society. 
We get one last big revelation, as Sunny goes to the limits of the Dream Realm he found Lo49 and realises that the dream realm has already started to absorb the real world.
We get Cassie's insane reaction to finding out that Sunny had been with them from the start.
We got all of that in LESS THAN 20 CHAPTERS BTW.

So now let's tackle the 2 major criticizm about the flashbacks, the first one being why have a timeskip/flashbacks ? 
Might be obvious but will still explain, it is for pacing issues, Sunny didn't do 50 million things in those 4 years, it was mostly the same thing for long periods, you guys were crying about the Wind Flower Island arc being too long etc... so imagine following normally Sunny in the Hollow mountain for 1.5 years 💀, same for when he returns to the real world, he manages stuff to open his restaurant and it takes a year to happen, the flashbacks made that soooo much quicker, we got peak with a fast pacing thanks to it.

The second is why was Sunny lazy during the 4 years etc...
A lot of people expected for Sunny to comeback like a fully maxed out character in a game, as a titan with insane memories, having his shadows completely evolved, shadow dance stronger and new weavers parts but none of that happened so some people are mad.
First off as said before Sunny was originally depressed and suicidal so do you really think he gave a fuck about becoming a titan when he had lost everything lol ?
Secondly it didn't make sense for G3 to make him get all of that in a timeskip (plus he did get information about weaver's parts and the lore) it's just better for him to do it in the present narration for the hype and the story etc...
Thirdly is that it would be impossible to manage ; Sunny currently is in a ""base form"" Saint as in he is a Saint but didn't upgrade any of his tools outside of it which is usually something that he does at every rank, he does it as a sleeper, an awakener, and a master, like from before antartica to end of the 3rd nightmare he's a master but he has upgraded so much, here even after 4 years Sunny has not upgraded anything and even then, there are more and more recent criticizm towards G3 about nerfing Sunny in some way or another.
Now IMAGINE if Sunny had came back from those 4 years maxed out, comparable to how he was as a master in the 3rd NM but as a Saint this time, how would it turn out ? Shit would be ridiculous ; Sunny would have to fight with no shadow on him, no echo shadow, shit memories while being half dead in every single fight and he would still be too strong lmao, anyway you get the idea. 
So yes I get that there are some issues with the current pacing (give vacation to G3 for a few months pls) but some of the criticizm just doesn't make sense or comes from people that don't understand the story well.

1g6yriq,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1g6yriq/what_did_i_do_wrong/,What did I do wrong?,"Okay quick breakdown:

Childhood up until 13 I had just your regular diet
13-15 vegetarian
16-21 vegan
22-added meat
22- 8 to 9 months carnivore
22 to now- animal based

I’ve dealt with severe bloating and intolerance since at least 18 or 19 years old.
During carnivore it got a lot better but I gained way too much weight imo. I had a body fat scan and I had 36% body fat. 

I was badly nauseated to the point where almost any smells triggered it, and I had to sleep propped up with pillows. I tried doing lower and higher fat ratios but it didn’t make a difference. I even cut out coffee for a long period of time (1-3 months). During my pre-carnivore but starting to eat meat phase, I got the doctors to test for hyplori- which I had and was treated for.

I can’t smell anything (unless it’s extremely strong) anymore so idk if that’s a bonus or not.
My nausea lessened when I went animal based. But then about a year ago it came back. So severe I’ve been to the ER. The doctors have tested me multiple times and nothing. The ER doctor prescribed me an anti-nausea medication that’s similar to gravol but works better. It helped but even then, at the start I had to have 4 pills just to be able to get up to use the bathroom. I had to take up to 8-10 just to eat anything at all. About 4 months ago now, it’s gotten better but still pretty prevalent. Had to keep taking 3-4 pills a day and do a mix of omad or small snacks to eat.

The only thing that helped the nausea way better was when I got prescribed Vyvanse a few months back for my adhd. It’s the only thing that allows me to eat until the effects wear off. Then the nausea comes rushing back and it’s horrible. Idk why it works and the doctors don’t either. But I’m happy it does. I know not everyone agrees with adhd being real or taking meds but I’m not here to argue that side- I respect our difference in opinions 👍❤️

I’m sorry for rambling but here’s my question- why didn’t my carnivore work for me? Why did I gain so much weight that it was borderline painful? Why did the nausea stay so long? I don’t get it.

I want to try carnivore again because I still have an intolerance to a food but idk which. I have felt congested for idk how long now- probably a year at minimum. Cutting out dairy/eggs/coffee, nothing helped more the a tiny tiny bit. But I won’t try carnivore again if it means my nausea is going to get worse. I can’t stand it. And no, I’m absolutely sure I’m not pregnant- it’s NOT morning sickness.

I really appreciate anyone who cared to read my long ramble and give kind advice 😂💕",1,1729303781.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I hope your trip was fun - do you ever get anything from the gift shops? Anyways, I've never heard of a snowy owl being at the zoo, but I *do* live in a desert, so maybe it's normal at zoos where the temperature isn't similar to a heating oven! My favorite sections to visit are always the aviary and big cat sections!

Thank you u/hispanglotexan for the plant card! My parents actually have a fiddle leaf fig tree in their house. It's large and beautiful and makes me want to get one of my own! I love tall plants. Anyways, wow, about fifty plants! That's awesome, I'm jealous. Do you have any favorites?

Thank you u/keqani for the fall ticket postcard! I love cards with die-cut/unique shapes! I haven't had any other cultural yogurt besides my own. The Vietnamese make one called da ua, but apparently it's called sữa chua (""sour milk"") as well! I remember my mom making them in baggies or recycled baby food jars. They're tart but make a refreshing treat, especially in warm weather!

Thank you u/bluejeanbaby25 for the World PC Day card! I love this design and adore anything that's philateic/stamp related! This is super creative, I love it. I think the heart-shaped earths on the back are cute too. Anyways, no unfortunately I have not heard of The Doms or Astrologer. Being in a band sounds awesome though! I've always thought that the idea was super cool and it sometimes make me feel fomo for only being able to play a classical instrument.

Thank you u/rennbrig for the postcard of Nagasaki! The photo is very pretty and the colors look lovely. One of the reasons why I'd love to travel out of the country is so I can take photos of sights like this! Regarding Japan though, I'd love to visit it in particular so I could see all the museums, theme parks, coffee shops, food places, and stationery shops!

Thank you u/frolickingfinns4ever for the cute strawberry card. Happy belated birthday! I love whenever my birthday rolls around too so I can get some change to spend on something that makes me happy (and do not need)! I just recently spent mine on aquarium supplies to start my nanotank and some postal stamps because I was running low. Also, I love dishware too! Occasionally I get a lucky find at the thrift/antique shop.

Thank you u/TheFeistyFox for the floral postcard! I love hearing about what people find sentimental. I get easily attached to things and can find sentimentality in anything! Regardless, your items sound very sweet, thanks for telling me about them :).

Thank you u/CurlyFlowers_415 for the cute birdhouse card! Thanks also for the birthday wish! I hope this year is full of new (and lasting) friendships and fun adventures as well! Emphasis on fun haha

Thank you u/post-cat-1710 for the awesome postcard! I'm not sure who the person is but they're very stunning and the artwork altogether is gorgeous! Also, I totally understand you about not being able to tolerate spices very well. Although spicy chips are fun, I always request no jalapenos when it comes to actual food (fries, sandwiches, and other sorts).

Thank you u/velocityoflove for the bulbasaur postcard! I love the rounded edges! Anyways, of the starters, bulbasaur is also my pick. Do you have a favorite pokemon in general? I have a few: lugia (funny that your boyfriend pulled its card), typhlosion, and altaria! It's interesting how none of them are from my favorite type though (water).

Thank you u/Powerful_Cobbler_215 for the galaxy cat card! Very overdue thank-you, as I believe this offer was from two or three months ago? Thanks for your patience, though! Anyways, I *also* had a shiny altaria! My pride and joy is called Bơ, which means butter in Vietnamese. I don't really care enough for shinies where I'd have a favorite, but I'll always collect them no matter what they are. I think toxicroak's shiny is pretty cool though! I think I named mine Acai.

Thank you u/ILovetravelandmail for the postcard from Germany! Hello friend, I hope you're doing well! Eating good food, watching movies, and traveling sound like amazing hobbies, haha. Where have you traveled to?

Thank you u/booty200 for the World PC Day card! I'm happy you liked the cactus flower postcard I sent you! Of all the designs from that offer, that one was my favorite. Thanks for sending me a Matisse card! Anyways, college has definitely ... been interesting. I've learned so much that it's overwhelming! Which is funny because I feel like I've retained little haha. Hope you're doing well!

Thank you u/Iambaby1989 for the very pretty blue marbled postcard! I love how the gold shines! The colors are altogether very pretty. Anyways, I hope you're doing alright and that October is treating you kindly!

Thank you mystery sender (signed by the initials of V.M.) for the postcard of a gray curled up cat. There was pink washi tape on the back that had a pattern of pink sparkles and white bunnies. You mentioned that your birthday was September 27, so happy belated birthday! I hope you had a lovely day yourself!

Thank you mystery sender (signed by A) for the card of ""The Arrival of Concord"". This card is a sheet of paper folded so that it behaves like a regular, openable card!

A month ago I pled to god to help me finally beat this alcohol habit I developed this year. I tried multiple times but found my self buying more liquor every single night. Negative thoughts always convinced me, ""F it, why not. Atleast I won't feel as bad about all the shit going on"". But I somehow found myself nearing a month of being sober. So I'm glad.

1g6yqli,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1g6yqli/we_lived_in_a_haunted_house_for_3_months_my/,We lived in a haunted house for 3 months. My family was terrified.,"     My husband and I sold our house and moved to another home that we were buying from a church. The home was built and owned by a couple from England who had no children. The husband passed away in the house. The wife got dementia and went into a home. They left the house to a church a few doors down.
    We were pre-approved for the mortgage,  but due to the church lawyer messing up paperwork, delaying our mortgage closing,  and our house already being sold, they let us move in prior to the actual purchase. 
    The house had been empty for several months prior to us moving in, but strange things started happening on day one. We live in Virginia,  but the day before we moved I had to leave and go to Massachusetts to help my mother. My sister-in-law, a few neices and nephews and my brother-in-law helped my husband and daughter move. 
      My husband, his sister and brother left the kids and four neices at the house to start unpacking while they went and got another load. While the adults were gone, the girls (ages 8 thru 16) were all unpacking my daughter's bedroom. The girls found a polly pocket set and decided to play with it for a little bit before the adults got back. All of the sudden the blinds start going up and down by themselves. This was still happening when the adults got back.
    Fast forward, everyone leaves, it's just my husband and two daughters. The girls go to sleep, reluctantly. My husband does NOT believe in ghosts or anything supernatural. Our previous house had a friendly haunting and he always scoffed at me when I would tell him that I saw one of the previous occupants of the house. At any rate, husband goes to bed in our bedroom. He feels like he is being stared at and is very uncomfortable. After about an hour of this, he goes to the living room. Moves the furniture in such a way that he is sleeping on the couch in an enclosed space. Think like back in the 1800's when they would ""circle the wagons"". Furniture placed in a circle with the coffee table and TV in the middle. He called me at 1 am, unable to sleep because something was watching him. This goes on every night.
     I come home a few days later and start to try to complete the unpacking. He goes back to work. I am VERY uncomfortable in this house. I'm very sensitive to spirits. My every move was being watched. Going into the basement would cause me to be unable to breathe. I tried to get a priest to bless the house, but it was impossible to get someone there in my time frame. I can't get any work done. My son, who wasn't even one yet, was very restless in the house. Cranky and needy, and he was previously a very happy baby. 
     Weird things kept happening. Things going missing, footsteps upstairs when nobody was up there, blinds moving by themselves, the kitchen door swinging open by itself. That door had to be pushed hard. 
      The last straw was when the doorbell started ringing at 3 am EVERY night. We would get up and answer the door, of course nobody was there. Shut the door. As soon as we walk away the doorbell would ring again. We immediately pulled out of the deal and moved. I never slept so well as I did the first night out of that house.
      Another couple bought the house about 9 months after we moved. The house was a 2500 square foot brick house. It was beautiful. It's been 15 years since we lived there. The people that bought it are still adding on to it. It has been under construction for 14 years. All I can think of is the Winchester house because all of the additions they have done do not match. Thoughts of what might be in that house?? I feel like it was demonic. Almost like there is a portal or Indian burial ground that got disturbed under that house.

1g6yoyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1g6yoyl/manual_espresso_roast_level/,Manual espresso roast level,"What roast level are you currently enjoying with flair manual espresso? I really enjoy clarity of flavor and balance between sweetness, acidity, body, and bitterness in a well made espresso shot. My flair pro 2 is more than capable of delivering this in the cup. Early on when I first bought my flair I wasted 1-2 kilograms worth of coffee before I realized that if I valued the characteristics above I needed to do more than just use good beans and use a flair to achieve the correct brew pressure and shot times. Through trial and error I learned some important lessons I wanted to share in this post. 1) use a coffee you already like brewed other ways. After struggling using blends with ""espresso"" written on the bag I went down a social media rabbit hole to discover that it was ok not to use coffee labeled ""espresso"" for espresso. These blends had the sweetness but the roast level was too dark to afford the balance and clarity I sought. I was stuck between being able to extract a very soluble coffee well but not liking the coffee even though it had sweetness and low acidity and was well extracted, and struggling with under-extracted single origin light roasts at the 1:2 ratio. 2) after switching to single origin lighter roasted beans I was getting frustrated and paying too much attention to other variables as I pulled the shot and accidentally pulled the lever all of the way down and got a shot of approx 1:3.2 ratio and I tried it even though the internet said it wouldn't be espresso. It was fantastic. I began experimenting with everything and gave myself permission to make shots that would make espresso drinking nonagenarians cringe. Preinfusion with the flair, turbo shots, slayer style shots, filter 2.0, and nomacano. Now I know 2) all beans are for espresso light and dark, SO and blend but the internet has far more information that is unhelpful than helpful and way more stuff about traditional dark roast espresso than lighter roast single origin 3) grinder matters, machine doesn't as much 4) if you don't like the shot parameters you find online grind courser and throw the parameters out the window. 5) taste your mistakes. They might finally bring that clarity and balance you were seeking even if they aren't supposed to.These days I mostly pull 1:3.2 ratio turbo style shots in 15-30 seconds or I grind finer and pull slayer style long preinfusion shots (mostly accidentally) at 1:3. I scoop out the crema. I apologize to no one. And it took me a while but I like my flair again because it can do all of those shot types out of the box without any modifications. Hope this helps someone reading who may be struggling to get a good shot out of a flair. If you like lighter roasts then change only one variable at a time. Preheat the crap out of your flair. If it's too hot to pick up even by the silicone that's the right temperature. Work quickly. ",1,1729303537.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

I am proud of it and thought I would share here. I definitely think it hits a ton of general FAQs for personal finance. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The advice contained is simply what I personally know. 99% of it I learned as a 17 year old in high school. The financial institutions/products I mention are simply what I have used and thus recommend. I understand that the companies/funds/credit cards are not perfect and there may be better options. Do your own research. I understand that what has worked for me will not work for everyone. I understand that there are a lot of other great or better ways to go about things. I don't claim this to be a perfect guide by any means. I also know that much of this advice applies to any age. I am 23 and not a financial advisor. It's just a guide I made initially for my cousin. It's not that deep.

I am very fortunate and come from a middle class background. I know that many in this subreddit are unable to do many of the steps I recommend. Regardless, I still think there are some helpful points I make, particularly in the ""Saving Tips"" section, that some here may find useful. I also think having a better understanding of credit, regardless of your situation can be helpful. While this guide is not aimed specifically at those below the poverty line, I believe financial literacy is extremely important and the general concepts contained should be common knowledge and taught in all schools. 

Guide TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA. 

P.S. Sorry for any formatting issues. I copy and pasted this from a PDF version which is much easier to read and has a graph and a chart I made (DM me to get it - if that's easily possible)

* ●  Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ○ Checking Account: “360 Checking” ○ Savings Account: “360 Performance Savings” (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving’s account)
* ●  Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to

make purchases in person with

* ○  You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks
* ○  For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account

● Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in

your checking account  
○ When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from

savings to checking  
● The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year

which will be paid monthly  
○ Ex. If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25

each month ($300 for the year = 3%)

Step #2 - Emergency Fund

* ●  Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account
   * ○  Ex. $2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum
   * ○  A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000
* ●  (RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!

■ I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards

Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off  
\*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*

● Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ○ I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I

consider paying debt in the “investing” category  
■ If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put

30% of your income towards paying down bad debt  
● Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra

towards debts  
○ Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr

after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.

* ●  Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans
* ●  When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest

○ Ex. You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into

Step #4 - Credit Card

\*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*

* ●  Open a “Discover It Secured Card” with Discover Bank ○ You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ○ You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ○ Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ○ Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay
* ●  Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)
   * ○  To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money
   * ○  NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS
* ●  After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount

○ As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months

■ Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score

● With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ○ A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide

Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account

\*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*

* ●  Create an account with Fidelity and open a “Roth IRA”
* ●  Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income
   * ○  I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)
   * ○  $7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo)
* ●  Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month
   * ○  75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or “Fidelity 500 Index Fund” (S&P 500 / the US Stock Market)
   * ○  25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or “Fidelity International Index Fund” (the International Stock Market outside of the US)

■ Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically  
○ Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)

* ●  Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty)
* ●  Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time
   * ○  Investing in individual stocks is gambling
   * ○  Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.

Bonus Steps for your 20’s:

1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount

* ○  This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth
* ○  If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards
* 2.   If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards■ 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ■ 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally)
* ○  If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs)
* ○  I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee

Additional Steps for your 30’s

\*Move on to these steps in your 20’s if you can\*

1. Hire a financial advisor  
If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor  
Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor  
A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)

2. Start investing in bond funds  
Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age

* Ex. 30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds
* Ex. 50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or “Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund” Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule

3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K

○ OR other great options include:

* HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined)
* 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member’s education costs (use to save for kid’s college)4. Save up for and purchase a home
* ○  While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home
* ○  Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don’t accidentally spend the money

Saving Tips

Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one’s financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.

Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on “the big important things”, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.

As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn’t the issue. It’s actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it’s also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.

Tactical Tips:  
Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it - You were

living before, weren’t you?

Wait to Buy Something - Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.

Have a spending account and a savings account - Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.

Don’t Window Shop - Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don’t browse!

Review your Expenses - Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.

Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account - If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don’t miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.

Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:

“Stop using material things to fight insecurity” - Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what’s comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don’t wait until you’re old to realize what’s really important. Work on that now.

“The little things add up” - $2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.

“Would I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?” - Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?

“How many hours/shifts of work does this cost?” - Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day’s work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?

“Saving is a tax free way of “making” money” - You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.

“What is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?” - Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?

“If I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I’m older” - Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don’t need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.

“I’m stealing money from the future me/family” - What do you value more, the novel item you don’t need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?

“Instead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?” - How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.

If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets: “Do I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years” - A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.

Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score

A credit score is extremely important, however it’s something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don’t know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.

First off, a credit score or “FICO” score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.

Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.

If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.

Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:

300 - 579 = POOR  
580 - 669 = FAIR  
670 - 739 = GOOD  
740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT

When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into “good” or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the “Very good” category or better.

Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.

Payment History - 35%  
Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%  
New Credit Opened - 10%  
Credit Mix - 10%

What each category means and how to do well in each:

Payment History - How often have you made payments on time?

1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly.
2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history.
3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don’t close card accounts for this reason.

\*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*

Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you’re late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you’re only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)

Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)

1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit. Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit.
2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card.
3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase
4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don’t just make minimum payments.

Length of Credit History - How long is your average line of credit?

1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now.
2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit.
3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines. Ex. A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.

New Credit Opened - How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for “Length of Credit History”

Credit Mix - Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?  
1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit

cards) vs installment (loans). Ex. It’s better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards

Payment history is the most important by far and so it’s crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.

Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don’t want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.

Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.

Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)

Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.  
In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.

A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let’s say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!

Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don’t have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.  

Example - A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:  
\*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\* Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)  
Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)  
Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)  
Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)  
Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)  
Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)

In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!

If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)

Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).

Example - $5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages) \*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*  
18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00  
20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07

25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43

Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.

By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don’t just save!

Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)

Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (“Post tax”)  
Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (“Pre tax”)

When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.

When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20’s and 30’s it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA

\*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*

Example #1 - Roth IRA

Income: $50,000  
Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000  
Amount at Retirement: $74,872

Example #2 - 401k

Income: $100,000  
Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000  
Amount at Retirement: $19,313

In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.

Roasted three coffees today and while I sent the majority of the beans off to the intended recipient I kept my customary few grams to subject to quality control. Wow do they smell different. I roasted 1) Costa Rica mechanically washed / white honey from Finca Jose 2) Rwanda Kivu Kageyo washed peaberry 3) Burundi Masha honey processed coffee. All three coffees have a density score above average or higher. I subjected them all to a relatively short and hot roast for espresso to a full city roast level (no second crack on any of them. The smells suggest that I hit my target on all of them. There is sweet sugar smells, smells I don't get in light roasts of chocolate roast tones, and even some fruit(yes! I roasted to keep a little hint of those light roast flavors to balance out the rest of the espresso shot so it isn't all chocolate and roast). The reason for this post is that the smells of each roast suggest different degrees of fruitiness and chocolate. I will describe them for you and post pictures in this thread. I was impressed that even thought there was similar moisture loss and similar roasts profile and similar density and processing with similar finally color and identical end temp I have varying degrees of fruitiness penetrating this full city roast intended to have fruit but not necessarily to highlight it. I will taste them in five days to evaluate how much fruit they each have and how much sweetness and chocolate. But I wonder if the difference in fruit character to the smells is due to some intrinsic character to the bean rather than a variable I can easily understand. Is it terroir? Is it a subtle variation in roast degree? Whatever it is coffee continues to impress me.

I think skinwalkers are staying here.,"If you're ever driving down Route 106 in Michigan, and you see a sign for the Greenbriar Motel, you better just keep on driving. Because there is something terribly wrong here, and the last thing I would want is for more people to die.

I started working at the Greenbriar Motel a week ago. It wasn’t a dream job by any standards: night shift at the front desk, checking people in and out, doing some inventory in the back. I liked the peace and quiet, though: as a little rundown motel on a stretch of isolated highway in Michigan, it gave me a lot of time to read and play computer games on the clock. It also helped that the owner, Frank, didn’t seem to care I was a high school dropout with a rap sheet.

But on the very first day, I felt that something was terribly off.

For one, there was the smell. When the wind shifted, the entire parking lot smelled like rotting meat. I ran to close the windows, but even then I could still smell it, seeping in through the HVAC system. The motel is surrounded by deep woods, so I figured maybe we were near the kill grounds of some animal. Or maybe it was just the endless roadkill of deer and possums on the highway.

Either way, it was unsettling. And definitely not enjoyable.

The other thing that struck me as odd were the guests’ rooms. Some of them didn’t have windows—and it seemed like that was intentional. I could see the lines in the paint, the seams outlining where windows had once been. When I asked Frank, he told me that some of the guests asked for windowless rooms. That they were in high demand. He didn’t elaborate, and honestly, I was a little scared to press him on it.

Things went from strange to downright creepy, however, as soon as Frank left. As I got set up at my desk, a woman walked into the room.

She was in her 40s, maybe, with black hair and very pale skin. As soon as she stepped inside, she locked the door behind her. “Frank left, right?” she asked me.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Uh… who are you?”

She introduced herself as Matilda. She’d been working here for a decade, cleaning the motel rooms after the guests checked out. After a few minutes of small talk, she suddenly came up to the counter and lowered her voice.

“I want to make sure you’re safe around here,” she said, glancing back towards the door nervously. “So I need you to listen to me. Okay?”

My heart dropped. “Uh… okay?”

“Whatever you do, don’t ask questions. Just check people in, check them out, and mind your own business. And then, you’ll be fine.”

My stomach did a little flip. Okay, so it was *that* kind of motel. Illegal business of multiple kinds, probably, all being conducted under our dilapidated roof. “What… what if the police come? Will I be arrested, too?”

She gave me a blank stare. “The police?”

“Say they find… evidence of illegal activity in one of the rooms. Will that get me in trouble? I already have shoplifting on my record and can’t—”

She shook her head. “Don’t worry about the police. Just don’t ask questions. And don’t make eye contact, or look at their faces for too long.”

I swallowed. *They don’t want witnesses. They don’t want me to be able to pick them out of a lineup,* I thought.“Okay. I won’t ask questions, and I won’t look at them for too long. Got it.”

She smiled at me. “You have nothing to worry about.”

As it turned out, though, I had quite a lot to worry about.

That night, I checked in three people. They were almost like caricatures: a big, strong guy in sunglasses that looked like he’d stepped right out of *The Godfather.* A woman dressed to the 9s, wearing a more makeup than a clown. A skinny young guy in a hoodie that smelled of something chemical and strange.

But I listened to Matilda. I didn’t ask questions. I didn’t even ask the questions I should’ve been asking—like when Hoodie Guy gave me an ID that was clearly fake. *Don’t ask questions and you’ll be fine.* I kept repeating that to myself. And I kept my eyes glued to the computer screen, never even glancing up at them.

When it hit midnight, I assumed the rest of the night would be smooth sailing. On this lonely stretch of highway, it was unlikely anyone else would check in. I pulled up *Minesweeper* and played some music on my phone.

My peace and quiet, however, was interrupted by the door swinging open. At 2 AM.

I glanced up to see the guy in sunglasses—the guy who looked like he’d stepped out of *The Godfather.*

*Oh, no. I should’ve locked the door…* I swallowed and kept my eyes glued to the computer screen as he approached. “Can I help you?” I asked, watching him in my peripheral vision.

“Do you have any razors for purchase?”

I froze. *Razors? At 2 AM?* I instantly got a mental image of him slashing someone up in his room. Blood all over the sheets, soaking into the carpet. “Uh, no, we don’t have any razors,” I said, keeping my eyes on the computer screen.

“Can you just check in the back, please?”

I swallowed. I really, *really* didn’t want to go check. As soon as I turned around, he could do anything. Pull out a gun. Tackle me. Force me into a chokehold and keep me hostage.

But refusing him was just as bad, if not worse. It might make him mad. *Really* mad.

I sat there, staring at *Minesweeper* on the screen, weighing my options. Paying close attention to him out of the corner of my eye.

And that’s when I saw it.

There was something… off… about this guy. His sunglasses looked like they were slightly too low on his face. Like the eyes they were covering weren’t in quite the right place. And not only that, but I couldn’t see his eyebrows poking above the frames, or the contours of his brow ridge. Everything above the glasses was perfectly flat and smooth. Like he had no eye sockets at all.

“Can you check in the back, please?” he asked again, his voice taking on an annoyed tone.

“Y-yes. Sure.”

I sprung out of the seat and ducked into the back storage area. I quickly glanced over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me—but he wasn’t. I had half a mind to just stay there, hiding out in the back storage room, until I heard his voice calling me.

“Did you find them?”

He sounded angry. Approaching furious.

Thankfully, I *did* find a few packaged razors next to some spare toothbrushes and soap we kept. I grabbed them and handed them over, keeping my eyes trained on the floor. “Thank you,” he said, sounding pleased.

And that was it. He turned around and left.

As soon as the door shut, I ran over and locked it. I closed the blinds and sat back down at the front desk, my heart hammering in my chest. All I could picture were the strange contours of his face.

And as I sat there, I realized something. All three guests that I’d checked in since the start of my shift—the Godfather guy, the Makeup woman, the Hoodie guy—had something covering their face or head. I mean, I wasn’t exaggerating about the woman having enough makeup for a clown. She was wearing foundation so thick that it cracked around the corners of her eyes and lips, and wore false eyelashes so long they gave the appearance of spider legs. And Hoodie Guy had kept his hood pulled so tightly over his head that his ears and hair weren’t visible.

It was like they all had something to hide.

Morning couldn’t come soon enough. As soon as the day shift workers arrived, I got the hell out of there. I floored it back to my house and slept for a long time, my sleep plagued with nightmares of faceless people and spidery eyelashes. 

Then it was time to go back to the motel for night #2.

Thankfully, it was a quieter night. Although the VACANCY sign glowed brightly in the darkness, no one checked in during my shift. They must’ve all come earlier, during the day shift. I locked the door, sat down with a cup of coffee, and enjoyed getting some reading done in the quiet.

Unfortunately, the quiet didn’t last long. Around midnight, I heard a loud *slam* from outside.

I threw my book down and ran over to the window. 

The door to room 16 was wide open.

I looked around. Nobody appeared to be outside; the parking lot, and the sidewalk, were empty. The room itself was dark—none of the lights were on.

I walked over to the computer and looked up the room. To my surprise, no one had booked it for tonight.

*Should I go out and close the door?*

I hesitated. It was late. There was no one around, except for the occasional passing car. If someone had broken into that room… and then attacked me… there would be no one to hear me scream.

So I kept the door locked tight and accessed the security camera feed instead. As I rewound it, I saw what happened: the door had opened, and then a woman had walked out of it. I couldn’t see her face—just her long dark hair.

She then disappeared into room 22.

I checked room 22 on the computer, and saw it was booked to a woman named Cassandra Johnson.

I frowned. Looked like Cassandra might be going into our vacant rooms and possibly stealing stuff. Matilda must’ve forgotten to lock up the room after she cleaned it. I sighed, opened the door, and began walking towards the open room.

I thought of knocking on room 22, but then thought better of it. *Keep your nose out of other people’s business.* I’d just lock up room 16 and go back to the lobby, like a good little employee.

I walked towards to the open room. But as soon as I got close, a horrible smell wafted out of the room. Like something rotting, decaying. My stomach turned. What did Cassandra do in there? Throw up? Stash all her garbage in there?

I reached into the darkness of the room. Bracing myself, I flicked on the light.

The room looked normal. The bed was made. The carpet was clean. But the smell had only intensified. I pinched my nose as I glanced around, starting to feel nauseous.

And then I saw it.

There was… something… on the carpet. Just barely poking out from the other side of the bed.

What *is* that? It was tan, and folded over itself. Like a beige sheet or pillowcase had been bunched up on the other side. But all our sheets were white. I stepped into the room, my heart pounding in my chest. “Hello?” I called out.

Nothing.

The smell got even worse as I approached the bed. Nausea washed over me. I forced myself to keep going, pinching my nose, swallowing down the urge to throw up.

I peered over the side of the bed—and froze.

There was a pile of beige, slightly translucent material folded over itself on the other side. But I instantly recognized certain shapes attached to it. Awfully familiar shapes. Like five fingers, resembling a glove made of skin, poking out from under one of the folds.

It looked like someone had *shed their skin.*

I stepped back, my legs shaking underneath me. *Nonono. There’s no way. It can’t be…* I backed away, towards the door, my throat dry. Because it didn’t make sense. It didn’t even make sense with a horrible crime. There wasn’t any blood on it. It hadn’t been cut off someone. It was like a snake skin, clean and perfect, holding the shape of its wearer like a ghost.

I ran out of the room—

And saw, walking towards me down the sidewalk, the woman from room 22.

Strands of her dark, straight hair hung over her face. But I could tell, through her hair, that there was something wrong with her face—her eyes, her lips, were in *slightly* the wrong position. She strode towards me, fast, her shoes clicking on the pavement.

I didn’t want to find out what she’d do if she caught me.

I whipped around and ran as fast as I could. I could hear her behind me, but I forced myself to go faster, and faster, until I was inside the lobby. I clicked the lock shut and collapsed in the back room, where she couldn’t see me.

That’s when the whistling started.

Just outside the door, I could hear her. Whistling. The source of the sound shifted as she circled the lobby area, looking for a way in. I heard it at the door. Then at the back. Then through the side windows. Then back at the front door.

This went on for an *hour.*

Finally, the whistling faded. But I didn’t move. I stayed there, huddled in the back storage room, until dawn broke. As soon as the day shift arrived, I booked it out of there as fast as I could.

\*\*\*

I wanted to quit. With everything I am, I wanted to just walk away.

But I needed the money. I already knew how hard it was, finding a job with a rap sheet. It was either go back to the job, or face eviction.

So I went back.

When I got on shift, though, I pulled Matilda aside and told her what I’d seen. I asked her again and again if my life was in danger. Asked her what the hell was going on here. If other people were in danger, too.

“I promise you. As long as you mind your own business, you’ll be safe.”

So that’s what I did. I minded my own business. And for the next few days, nothing of note happened. Sure, there were a few people who checked in that were wearing hats or sunglasses or extra makeup, but I just tried to avoid eye contact with them. Tried to keep my head down and my nose out of other people’s business.

But then came the night of November 14.

It was raining that night. The rain came down in sheets, and every so often, I heard a peal of thunder shake the windows. I wasn't expecting anyone to come in that night, as I hadn’t seen that many cars driving by on the highway. The rain seemed to keep everybody in.

But then I heard a knock. When I looked up, I saw a man staring in the window.

A chill ran down my spine. He was wearing a hoodie that hid his head and kept his face mostly in shadow. And he was rather aggressively banging on the window—like he was in a hurry. I grabbed the mace I kept under the counter and slipped it into my pocket.

Then I approached the window.

“Do you have any vacancies?” he asked in a low voice, barely audible above the pounding rain.

The VACANCY sign glowed brightly behind him. There’s no way he could’ve missed it.

“Yeah. Come on in,” I said, unlocking the door with one hand and gripping the mace in my pocket with the other.

He stepped inside. Rain dripped off his jacket and onto the floor. I barely glanced at him, turning around and walking back around the counter. Then I sat down at the computer, keeping my eyes fixed on the screen.

In my peripheral vision, I could see him.

Leaning over the counter. His face only about a foot or two from mine. So close that I could smell the stale, mothball odor coming off his clothes. So close I could hear drops of water plopping onto the counter from his sleeve.

“Can you go faster?” he asked, his voice raspy in his throat.

“Sorry, sir—I’m going fast as I can,” I replied, my heart starting to pound. “It’s an old computer.” My fingers slipped on the mouse as I rushed to click the buttons.

“I don’t have all day,” he growled, looming even closer to me.

I wanted to look at him. My eyes were itching to glance up at the man that was six inches from my face. But I forced myself to stare at the screen. Whatever the hell was going on here, I was not going to be a witness. I was not going to look up and find myself face-to-face with a Smith & Wesson.

“Your name?” I asked.

As soon as the words came out of my mouth, I froze. I needed a name to book the room. That’s all. But maybe he wouldn’t see it that way. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to ask for names. Maybe that was part of Frank’s understanding with certain guests.

Thankfully, nothing happened. After a second of hesitation, he replied, “Daniel Jones.”

The name struck me as fake. Common first name, common last name. But who even cared at this point? I typed his name into the system and completed the booking process. He paid for the room in cash, which was another unnerving detail, but I tried not to worry about it. I turned my back and took a key off the hook. “Room 7,” I said, handing it to him.

He thanked me, and then waited by the door.

I waited for a minute. Then two. But he didn’t leave.

“Do you need something?” I asked, careful not to make eye contact.

“Can you escort me to my room?”

*Oh, hell no.*

There was no way I could go out there. In the middle of the night. With this creepy guy. That was like a death sentence. I glanced out the window and spotted his car—a beat-up sedan—in one of the nearby parking spaces.

The murder scenario played out in my head.

*Shoves me into the hotel room.*

*Kills me.*

*Sticks my body in the trunk.*

*Throws it in the middle of the woods.*

Or maybe worse. Maybe my skin would end up crumpled on the floor of one of the rooms. Maybe he’d take my form, or turn me into something that sheds its skin like a snake. That has eyes too low on its face. Or no eye sockets at all.

And the longer I looked at him, in the corner of my eye, the more I noticed how unsavory he looked. There were smears of dirt on his sleeves and on the hem of his pants. *Like he’s been digging a grave,* the voice in my head added. His face, half-hidden in shadow, was sunken and gaunt. His jaw was covered in gray stubble, and his teeth were a horrible shade of grayish yellow.

“Can’t… can’t you just go yourself? I have something that I, uh, need to do here. My boss is going to be mad—”

“*You can take two minutes to walk me to my room, dammit!”*

I sat there in stunned silence. He sounded furious. My heart pounded in my ears. “Okay,” I said, finally. My fingers curled around the mace in my pocket, and then I joined him by the door. “I’ll walk you to your room.”

He didn’t thank me. He just grabbed the door and swung it open, nearly letting it swing back in my face.

I stepped out into the pouring rain with him. The parking lot was a lake, and our feet sloshed loudly through the water. The cold water seeped through my sneakers, and I shivered. I followed the man to his car, staying a good fifteen feet away. He popped the trunk, and I held my breath—but thankfully, there was only a duffel bag inside.

He hoisted it on his shoulder and started for Room 7. I followed him at a distance, staying several feet away, watching him fidget with the key.

“You got a lot of other people staying here right now?” he asked, as he slid the key into the lock.

“Some,” I replied.

“Not great weather for it.”

“Not really.”

“The storm’s supposed to clear tomorrow. It’ll be good weather then.”

*Wow, this is taking a while,* I thought to myself.

That’s when I looked down at his hands—and noticed that he wasn’t really *trying* to get into his room. He was just inserting the key, pausing, and then pulling it out. Over and over again.

He was stalling for time.

He was keeping me here, on purpose.

I looked up from his hands—just in time to see him staring at me. His blue eyes were intense, studying me.

I wanted to run away. Every inch of me was screaming to get out of there. But the guy had six inches on me, and was really thin—he’d probably catch me in seconds. I was never much of a runner.

I slipped my hand in my pocket, curling my fingers around the mace. “Do you need help getting into your room?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“I’m going to go back to the front desk,” I said, taking a step back.

As soon as I said that, he froze. His eyes widened as he stared at me. Slowly, he shook his head, his lips stretching into a grimace that revealed his yellowed teeth.

“Don’t go,” he growled, his voice barely audible above the rain. “Stay exactly where you are.”

I leapt into action. I whipped the mace out of my pocket and held it in front of me, pointing it right at him. “Don’t get any closer!”

My finger hovered over the trigger—

And then I heard it.

Someone was whistling.

Behind me, somewhere in the rain. The song cut through the pattering raindrops like a knife.

It was the same eerie tune that woman had whistled a few days ago.

“I’m sorry,” the man said quietly, his blue eyes locked on mine. “But I needed bait.”

I stared at him. My brain couldn’t even process what he was saying. *Bait?* I took a stumbling step back.

The whistling grew louder.

I whipped around. Through the rain, I could see someone walking through the parking lot. Barely lit by the flickering streetlamp. The mace fell from my hands and clattered to the ground.

Then I turned and ran as fast as I could towards the lobby.

The whistling stopped.

And then I could hear loud, splashing footsteps, growing louder with every second behind me—

I swung the door open, slammed it shut, and turned the lock. I pulled the blinds down over the window. Panting, I parted them with my fingertips and peered out into the night.

There was a woman standing in the parking lot.

The same woman I had seen a week ago.

Her hair and clothes were drenched with rain. But she was smiling—this big, lopsided grin that sent chills down my spine. And her eyes were strange, wide and wild, incredibly light blue. In the darkness, it almost looked like she didn’t have irises at all. Just two pinholes for pupils, staring right at my door.

*Nonono.*

She took a step forward.

I ran over to my desk. Grabbed my cell phone. Started dialing 911. “Come on, come on…”

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at the Greenbriar Motel and there’s this guy, and this weird woman—”

*Thump.*

I was cut off by a loud thump nearby. I ran to the window and peered out.

The man who’d booked Room 7 was running towards the woman. He was holding something up in the air—a short dagger, gleaming silver in the rain. “He’s attacking her!” I screamed into the phone.

The woman’s face changed.

Her features twisted—her grin crept up to her eyes. Her arms crackled and stretched. She blinked, and her eyes turned pure white. Her body twisted unnaturally at the waist, so that she was facing the man.

With fast, jolted movements, she leapt at him.

Within seconds, he was dead. She stood on all fours above him, her knees bent the wrong way, her fingers far too long. With another horrible crackling sound, her neck stretched out two feet long, twisting and serpentine.

And then she looked at me.

I leapt away from the window with a scream. “What’s happening?” the operator asked me. “Sir, please, tell me what’s happening.”

I opened my mouth. Tried to speak. But only a squeaking sound came out.

By the time I made it back over to the window, the woman was standing there, looking down at her kill. She looked normal. Then she stepped over his body and walked towards the rooms.

To my horror, she pulled out a key and opened room 22.

Then she disappeared inside.

The police arrived a few minutes later. In strings of gibberish, I begged them to check room 22. That something horrible was lurking inside. But then they knocked on the door, a completely normal looking woman opened it.

I watched from the lobby. I couldn’t hear that much of their conversation over the pouring rain, but they weren’t arresting her. Weren’t accusing her. They seemed to just be having a friendly conversation, asking her what she’d seen.

Then they thanked her and came back to me.

“We’ll need to see the security tapes from tonight, please,” the officer said, in an accusing tone.

But when I showed them the tapes, they got quiet. One of the officers made a call to someone, saying something about an “infestation.” The other two officers ushered me out into the lobby, their faces grim. They told me not to leave as they talked among themselves in hushed voices in the corner of the room.

Then they approached.

“You didn’t see anything tonight,” the tall man said, leaning in close. “You got that?”

“I—but what about—”

“Listen to me very carefully,” he interrupted, lowering his voice. “You… didn’t… see… anything. Just like you never shoplifted in your life.”

“… What?”

“You understand me?” he asked.

The silence stretched out between us. “Yeah, I got it,” I said, my voice wavering. “I didn’t see anything.”

I left the motel and never went back.

I planned to never speak of what I saw. To keep my mouth shut, just like they told me to. But after losing many nights of sleep, I realized that I need to warn people. I need to warn you. I can’t have another person dying because of these *things,* whatever they are.

So, I beg you.

“Say they find… evidence of illegal activity in one of the rooms. Will that get me in trouble? I already have shoplifting on my record and can’t—”

She shook her head. “Don’t worry about the police. Just don’t ask questions. And don’t make eye contact, or look at their faces for too long.”

I swallowed. *They don’t want witnesses. They don’t want me to be able to pick them out of a lineup,* I thought.“Okay. I won’t ask questions, and I won’t look at them for too long. Got it.”

She smiled at me. “You have nothing to worry about.”

As it turned out, though, I had quite a lot to worry about.

That night, I checked in three people. They were almost like caricatures: a big, strong guy in sunglasses that looked like he’d stepped right out of *The Godfather.* A woman dressed to the 9s, wearing a more makeup than a clown. A skinny young guy in a hoodie that smelled of something chemical and strange.

But I listened to Matilda. I didn’t ask questions. I didn’t even ask the questions I should’ve been asking—like when Hoodie Guy gave me an ID that was clearly fake. *Don’t ask questions and you’ll be fine.* I kept repeating that to myself. And I kept my eyes glued to the computer screen, never even glancing up at them.

When it hit midnight, I assumed the rest of the night would be smooth sailing. On this lonely stretch of highway, it was unlikely anyone else would check in. I pulled up *Minesweeper* and played some music on my phone.

My peace and quiet, however, was interrupted by the door swinging open. At 2 AM.

I glanced up to see the guy in sunglasses—the guy who looked like he’d stepped out of *The Godfather.*

*Oh, no. I should’ve locked the door…* I swallowed and kept my eyes glued to the computer screen as he approached. “Can I help you?” I asked, watching him in my peripheral vision.

“Do you have any razors for purchase?”

I froze. *Razors? At 2 AM?* I instantly got a mental image of him slashing someone up in his room. Blood all over the sheets, soaking into the carpet. “Uh, no, we don’t have any razors,” I said, keeping my eyes on the computer screen.

“Can you just check in the back, please?”

I swallowed. I really, *really* didn’t want to go check. As soon as I turned around, he could do anything. Pull out a gun. Tackle me. Force me into a chokehold and keep me hostage.

But refusing him was just as bad, if not worse. It might make him mad. *Really* mad.

I sat there, staring at *Minesweeper* on the screen, weighing my options. Paying close attention to him out of the corner of my eye.

And that’s when I saw it.

There was something… off… about this guy. His sunglasses looked like they were slightly too low on his face. Like the eyes they were covering weren’t in quite the right place. And not only that, but I couldn’t see his eyebrows poking above the frames, or the contours of his brow ridge. Everything above the glasses was perfectly flat and smooth. Like he had no eye sockets at all.

“Can you check in the back, please?” he asked again, his voice taking on an annoyed tone.

“Y-yes. Sure.”

I sprung out of the seat and ducked into the back storage area. I quickly glanced over my shoulder to make sure he wasn’t following me—but he wasn’t. I had half a mind to just stay there, hiding out in the back storage room, until I heard his voice calling me.

“Did you find them?”

He sounded angry. Approaching furious.

Thankfully, I *did* find a few packaged razors next to some spare toothbrushes and soap we kept. I grabbed them and handed them over, keeping my eyes trained on the floor. “Thank you,” he said, sounding pleased.

And that was it. He turned around and left.

As soon as the door shut, I ran over and locked it. I closed the blinds and sat back down at the front desk, my heart hammering in my chest. All I could picture were the strange contours of his face.

And as I sat there, I realized something. All three guests that I’d checked in since the start of my shift—the Godfather guy, the Makeup woman, the Hoodie guy—had something covering their face or head. I mean, I wasn’t exaggerating about the woman having enough makeup for a clown. She was wearing foundation so thick that it cracked around the corners of her eyes and lips, and wore false eyelashes so long they gave the appearance of spider legs. And Hoodie Guy had kept his hood pulled so tightly over his head that his ears and hair weren’t visible.

It was like they all had something to hide.

Morning couldn’t come soon enough. As soon as the day shift workers arrived, I got the hell out of there. I floored it back to my house and slept for a long time, my sleep plagued with nightmares of faceless people and spidery eyelashes. 

Then it was time to go back to the motel for night #2.

Thankfully, it was a quieter night. Although the VACANCY sign glowed brightly in the darkness, no one checked in during my shift. They must’ve all come earlier, during the day shift. I locked the door, sat down with a cup of coffee, and enjoyed getting some reading done in the quiet.

Unfortunately, the quiet didn’t last long. Around midnight, I heard a loud *slam* from outside.

I threw my book down and ran over to the window. 

The door to room 16 was wide open.

I looked around. Nobody appeared to be outside; the parking lot, and the sidewalk, were empty. The room itself was dark—none of the lights were on.

I walked over to the computer and looked up the room. To my surprise, no one had booked it for tonight.

*Should I go out and close the door?*

I hesitated. It was late. There was no one around, except for the occasional passing car. If someone had broken into that room… and then attacked me… there would be no one to hear me scream.

So I kept the door locked tight and accessed the security camera feed instead. As I rewound it, I saw what happened: the door had opened, and then a woman had walked out of it. I couldn’t see her face—just her long dark hair.

She then disappeared into room 22.

I checked room 22 on the computer, and saw it was booked to a woman named Cassandra Johnson.

I frowned. Looked like Cassandra might be going into our vacant rooms and possibly stealing stuff. Matilda must’ve forgotten to lock up the room after she cleaned it. I sighed, opened the door, and began walking towards the open room.

I thought of knocking on room 22, but then thought better of it. *Keep your nose out of other people’s business.* I’d just lock up room 16 and go back to the lobby, like a good little employee.

I walked towards to the open room. But as soon as I got close, a horrible smell wafted out of the room. Like something rotting, decaying. My stomach turned. What did Cassandra do in there? Throw up? Stash all her garbage in there?

I reached into the darkness of the room. Bracing myself, I flicked on the light.

The room looked normal. The bed was made. The carpet was clean. But the smell had only intensified. I pinched my nose as I glanced around, starting to feel nauseous.

And then I saw it.

There was… something… on the carpet. Just barely poking out from the other side of the bed.

What *is* that? It was tan, and folded over itself. Like a beige sheet or pillowcase had been bunched up on the other side. But all our sheets were white. I stepped into the room, my heart pounding in my chest. “Hello?” I called out.

Nothing.

The smell got even worse as I approached the bed. Nausea washed over me. I forced myself to keep going, pinching my nose, swallowing down the urge to throw up.

I peered over the side of the bed—and froze.

There was a pile of beige, slightly translucent material folded over itself on the other side. But I instantly recognized certain shapes attached to it. Awfully familiar shapes. Like five fingers, resembling a glove made of skin, poking out from under one of the folds.

It looked like someone had *shed their skin.*

I stepped back, my legs shaking underneath me. *Nonono. There’s no way. It can’t be…* I backed away, towards the door, my throat dry. Because it didn’t make sense. It didn’t even make sense with a horrible crime. There wasn’t any blood on it. It hadn’t been cut off someone. It was like a snake skin, clean and perfect, holding the shape of its wearer like a ghost.

I ran out of the room—

And saw, walking towards me down the sidewalk, the woman from room 22.

Strands of her dark, straight hair hung over her face. But I could tell, through her hair, that there was something wrong with her face—her eyes, her lips, were in *slightly* the wrong position. She strode towards me, fast, her shoes clicking on the pavement.

I didn’t want to find out what she’d do if she caught me.

I whipped around and ran as fast as I could. I could hear her behind me, but I forced myself to go faster, and faster, until I was inside the lobby. I clicked the lock shut and collapsed in the back room, where she couldn’t see me.

That’s when the whistling started.

Just outside the door, I could hear her. Whistling. The source of the sound shifted as she circled the lobby area, looking for a way in. I heard it at the door. Then at the back. Then through the side windows. Then back at the front door.

This went on for an *hour.*

Finally, the whistling faded. But I didn’t move. I stayed there, huddled in the back storage room, until dawn broke. As soon as the day shift arrived, I booked it out of there as fast as I could.

\*\*\*

I wanted to quit. With everything I am, I wanted to just walk away.

But I needed the money. I already knew how hard it was, finding a job with a rap sheet. It was either go back to the job, or face eviction.

So I went back.

When I got on shift, though, I pulled Matilda aside and told her what I’d seen. I asked her again and again if my life was in danger. Asked her what the hell was going on here. If other people were in danger, too.

“I promise you. As long as you mind your own business, you’ll be safe.”

So that’s what I did. I minded my own business. And for the next few days, nothing of note happened. Sure, there were a few people who checked in that were wearing hats or sunglasses or extra makeup, but I just tried to avoid eye contact with them. Tried to keep my head down and my nose out of other people’s business.

But then came the night of November 14.

It was raining that night. The rain came down in sheets, and every so often, I heard a peal of thunder shake the windows. I wasn't expecting anyone to come in that night, as I hadn’t seen that many cars driving by on the highway. The rain seemed to keep everybody in.

But then I heard a knock. When I looked up, I saw a man staring in the window.

A chill ran down my spine. He was wearing a hoodie that hid his head and kept his face mostly in shadow. And he was rather aggressively banging on the window—like he was in a hurry. I grabbed the mace I kept under the counter and slipped it into my pocket.

Then I approached the window.

“Do you have any vacancies?” he asked in a low voice, barely audible above the pounding rain.

The VACANCY sign glowed brightly behind him. There’s no way he could’ve missed it.

“Yeah. Come on in,” I said, unlocking the door with one hand and gripping the mace in my pocket with the other.

He stepped inside. Rain dripped off his jacket and onto the floor. I barely glanced at him, turning around and walking back around the counter. Then I sat down at the computer, keeping my eyes fixed on the screen.

In my peripheral vision, I could see him.

Leaning over the counter. His face only about a foot or two from mine. So close that I could smell the stale, mothball odor coming off his clothes. So close I could hear drops of water plopping onto the counter from his sleeve.

“Can you go faster?” he asked, his voice raspy in his throat.

“Sorry, sir—I’m going fast as I can,” I replied, my heart starting to pound. “It’s an old computer.” My fingers slipped on the mouse as I rushed to click the buttons.

“I don’t have all day,” he growled, looming even closer to me.

I wanted to look at him. My eyes were itching to glance up at the man that was six inches from my face. But I forced myself to stare at the screen. Whatever the hell was going on here, I was not going to be a witness. I was not going to look up and find myself face-to-face with a Smith & Wesson.

“Your name?” I asked.

As soon as the words came out of my mouth, I froze. I needed a name to book the room. That’s all. But maybe he wouldn’t see it that way. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to ask for names. Maybe that was part of Frank’s understanding with certain guests.

Thankfully, nothing happened. After a second of hesitation, he replied, “Daniel Jones.”

The name struck me as fake. Common first name, common last name. But who even cared at this point? I typed his name into the system and completed the booking process. He paid for the room in cash, which was another unnerving detail, but I tried not to worry about it. I turned my back and took a key off the hook. “Room 7,” I said, handing it to him.

He thanked me, and then waited by the door.

I waited for a minute. Then two. But he didn’t leave.

“Do you need something?” I asked, careful not to make eye contact.

“Can you escort me to my room?”

*Oh, hell no.*

There was no way I could go out there. In the middle of the night. With this creepy guy. That was like a death sentence. I glanced out the window and spotted his car—a beat-up sedan—in one of the nearby parking spaces.

The murder scenario played out in my head.

*Shoves me into the hotel room.*

*Kills me.*

*Sticks my body in the trunk.*

*Throws it in the middle of the woods.*

Or maybe worse. Maybe my skin would end up crumpled on the floor of one of the rooms. Maybe he’d take my form, or turn me into something that sheds its skin like a snake. That has eyes too low on its face. Or no eye sockets at all.

And the longer I looked at him, in the corner of my eye, the more I noticed how unsavory he looked. There were smears of dirt on his sleeves and on the hem of his pants. *Like he’s been digging a grave,* the voice in my head added. His face, half-hidden in shadow, was sunken and gaunt. His jaw was covered in gray stubble, and his teeth were a horrible shade of grayish yellow.

“Can’t… can’t you just go yourself? I have something that I, uh, need to do here. My boss is going to be mad—”

“*You can take two minutes to walk me to my room, dammit!”*

I sat there in stunned silence. He sounded furious. My heart pounded in my ears. “Okay,” I said, finally. My fingers curled around the mace in my pocket, and then I joined him by the door. “I’ll walk you to your room.”

He didn’t thank me. He just grabbed the door and swung it open, nearly letting it swing back in my face.

I stepped out into the pouring rain with him. The parking lot was a lake, and our feet sloshed loudly through the water. The cold water seeped through my sneakers, and I shivered. I followed the man to his car, staying a good fifteen feet away. He popped the trunk, and I held my breath—but thankfully, there was only a duffel bag inside.

He hoisted it on his shoulder and started for Room 7. I followed him at a distance, staying several feet away, watching him fidget with the key.

“You got a lot of other people staying here right now?” he asked, as he slid the key into the lock.

“Some,” I replied.

“Not great weather for it.”

“Not really.”

“The storm’s supposed to clear tomorrow. It’ll be good weather then.”

*Wow, this is taking a while,* I thought to myself.

That’s when I looked down at his hands—and noticed that he wasn’t really *trying* to get into his room. He was just inserting the key, pausing, and then pulling it out. Over and over again.

He was stalling for time.

He was keeping me here, on purpose.

I looked up from his hands—just in time to see him staring at me. His blue eyes were intense, studying me.

I wanted to run away. Every inch of me was screaming to get out of there. But the guy had six inches on me, and was really thin—he’d probably catch me in seconds. I was never much of a runner.

I slipped my hand in my pocket, curling my fingers around the mace. “Do you need help getting into your room?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“I’m going to go back to the front desk,” I said, taking a step back.

As soon as I said that, he froze. His eyes widened as he stared at me. Slowly, he shook his head, his lips stretching into a grimace that revealed his yellowed teeth.

“Don’t go,” he growled, his voice barely audible above the rain. “Stay exactly where you are.”

I leapt into action. I whipped the mace out of my pocket and held it in front of me, pointing it right at him. “Don’t get any closer!”

My finger hovered over the trigger—

And then I heard it.

Someone was whistling.

Behind me, somewhere in the rain. The song cut through the pattering raindrops like a knife.

It was the same eerie tune that woman had whistled a few days ago.

“I’m sorry,” the man said quietly, his blue eyes locked on mine. “But I needed bait.”

I stared at him. My brain couldn’t even process what he was saying. *Bait?* I took a stumbling step back.

The whistling grew louder.

I whipped around. Through the rain, I could see someone walking through the parking lot. Barely lit by the flickering streetlamp. The mace fell from my hands and clattered to the ground.

Then I turned and ran as fast as I could towards the lobby.

The whistling stopped.

And then I could hear loud, splashing footsteps, growing louder with every second behind me—

I swung the door open, slammed it shut, and turned the lock. I pulled the blinds down over the window. Panting, I parted them with my fingertips and peered out into the night.

There was a woman standing in the parking lot.

The same woman I had seen a week ago.

Her hair and clothes were drenched with rain. But she was smiling—this big, lopsided grin that sent chills down my spine. And her eyes were strange, wide and wild, incredibly light blue. In the darkness, it almost looked like she didn’t have irises at all. Just two pinholes for pupils, staring right at my door.

*Nonono.*

She took a step forward.

I ran over to my desk. Grabbed my cell phone. Started dialing 911. “Come on, come on…”

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at the Greenbriar Motel and there’s this guy, and this weird woman—”

*Thump.*

I was cut off by a loud thump nearby. I ran to the window and peered out.

The man who’d booked Room 7 was running towards the woman. He was holding something up in the air—a short dagger, gleaming silver in the rain. “He’s attacking her!” I screamed into the phone.

The woman’s face changed.

Her features twisted—her grin crept up to her eyes. Her arms crackled and stretched. She blinked, and her eyes turned pure white. Her body twisted unnaturally at the waist, so that she was facing the man.

With fast, jolted movements, she leapt at him.

Within seconds, he was dead. She stood on all fours above him, her knees bent the wrong way, her fingers far too long. With another horrible crackling sound, her neck stretched out two feet long, twisting and serpentine.

And then she looked at me.

I leapt away from the window with a scream. “What’s happening?” the operator asked me. “Sir, please, tell me what’s happening.”

I opened my mouth. Tried to speak. But only a squeaking sound came out.

By the time I made it back over to the window, the woman was standing there, looking down at her kill. She looked normal. Then she stepped over his body and walked towards the rooms.

To my horror, she pulled out a key and opened room 22.

Then she disappeared inside.

The police arrived a few minutes later. In strings of gibberish, I begged them to check room 22. That something horrible was lurking inside. But then they knocked on the door, a completely normal looking woman opened it.

I watched from the lobby. I couldn’t hear that much of their conversation over the pouring rain, but they weren’t arresting her. Weren’t accusing her. They seemed to just be having a friendly conversation, asking her what she’d seen.

Then they thanked her and came back to me.

“We’ll need to see the security tapes from tonight, please,” the officer said, in an accusing tone.

But when I showed them the tapes, they got quiet. One of the officers made a call to someone, saying something about an “infestation.” The other two officers ushered me out into the lobby, their faces grim. They told me not to leave as they talked among themselves in hushed voices in the corner of the room.

Then they approached.

“You didn’t see anything tonight,” the tall man said, leaning in close. “You got that?”

“I—but what about—”

“Listen to me very carefully,” he interrupted, lowering his voice. “You… didn’t… see… anything. Just like you never shoplifted in your life.”

“… What?”

“You understand me?” he asked.

The silence stretched out between us. “Yeah, I got it,” I said, my voice wavering. “I didn’t see anything.”

I left the motel and never went back.

I planned to never speak of what I saw. To keep my mouth shut, just like they told me to. But after losing many nights of sleep, I realized that I need to warn people. I need to warn you. I can’t have another person dying because of these *things,* whatever they are.

So, I beg you.

I am proud of it and thought I would share here. While the guide is a lot more than just investing and so may not be ideal for this subreddit, I definitely think it hits some investing FAQs. 

For context, I am a 23 year old that became obsessed with personal finance at 17. I was able to hit a $100k net worth and 750 credit score at 22 prior to my peers' college graduation. Yes, I had some form of slight help from family, but I come from middle class and no money/inheritance was given to me. The point is not that I am some genius and successful. The point is that I learned some good advice online, actually followed a lot of it and want to share what I've learned. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The advice contained is simply what I personally know. 99% of it I learned as a 17 year old in high school. The financial institutions/products I mention are simply what I have used and thus recommend. I understand that the companies/funds/credit cards are not perfect and there may be better options. Do your own research. I understand that what has worked for me will not work for everyone.  I understand that there are a lot of other great or better ways to go about things. I don't claim this to be a perfect guide by any means. I am 23 and not a financial advisor. It's just a guide I made initially for my cousin. It's not that deep.

Guide TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA.

5 Steps to Get Ahead in Your 20’s

\*The following steps are generally in order of importance. Ideally, you should have the previous step accomplished prior to later steps\*

Step #1 - General Bank Accounts

* ●  Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ○ Checking Account: “360 Checking” ○ Savings Account: “360 Performance Savings” (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving’s account)
* ●  Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to

make purchases in person with

* ○  You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks
* ○  For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account

● Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in

your checking account  
○ When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from

savings to checking  
● The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year

which will be paid monthly  
○ Ex. If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25

each month ($300 for the year = 3%)

Step #2 - Emergency Fund

* ●  Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account
   * ○  Ex. $2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum
   * ○  A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000
* ●  (RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!

■ I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards

Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off  
\*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*

● Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ○ I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I

consider paying debt in the “investing” category  
■ If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put

30% of your income towards paying down bad debt  
● Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra

towards debts  
○ Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr

after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.

* ●  Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans
* ●  When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest

○ Ex. You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into

Step #4 - Credit Card

\*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*

* ●  Open a “Discover It Secured Card” with Discover Bank ○ You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ○ You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ○ Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ○ Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay
* ●  Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)
   * ○  To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money
   * ○  NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS
* ●  After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount

○ As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months

■ Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score

● With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ○ A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide

Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account

\*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*

* ●  Create an account with Fidelity and open a “Roth IRA”
* ●  Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income
   * ○  I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)
   * ○  $7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo)
* ●  Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month
   * ○  75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or “Fidelity 500 Index Fund” (S&P 500 / the US Stock Market)
   * ○  25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or “Fidelity International Index Fund” (the International Stock Market outside of the US)

■ Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically  
○ Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)

* ●  Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty)
* ●  Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time
   * ○  Investing in individual stocks is gambling
   * ○  Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.

Bonus Steps for your 20’s:

1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount

* ○  This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth
* ○  If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards
* 2.   If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards■ 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ■ 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally)
* ○  If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs)
* ○  I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee

Additional Steps for your 30’s

\*Move on to these steps in your 20’s if you can\*

1. Hire a financial advisor  
If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor  
Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor  
A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)

2. Start investing in bond funds  
Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age

* Ex. 30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds
* Ex. 50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or “Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund” Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule

3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K

○ OR other great options include:

* HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined)
* 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member’s education costs (use to save for kid’s college)4. Save up for and purchase a home
* ○  While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home
* ○  Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don’t accidentally spend the money

Saving Tips

Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one’s financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.

Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on “the big important things”, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.

As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn’t the issue. It’s actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it’s also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.

Tactical Tips:  
Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it - You were

living before, weren’t you?

Wait to Buy Something - Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.

Have a spending account and a savings account - Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.

Don’t Window Shop - Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don’t browse!

Review your Expenses - Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.

Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account - If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don’t miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.

Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:

“Stop using material things to fight insecurity” - Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what’s comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don’t wait until you’re old to realize what’s really important. Work on that now.

“The little things add up” - $2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.

“Would I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?” - Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?

“How many hours/shifts of work does this cost?” - Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day’s work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?

“Saving is a tax free way of “making” money” - You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.

“What is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?” - Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?

“If I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I’m older” - Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don’t need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.

“I’m stealing money from the future me/family” - What do you value more, the novel item you don’t need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?

“Instead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?” - How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.

If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets: “Do I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years” - A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.

Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score

A credit score is extremely important, however it’s something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don’t know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.

First off, a credit score or “FICO” score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.

Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.

If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.

Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:

300 - 579 = POOR  
580 - 669 = FAIR  
670 - 739 = GOOD  
740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT

When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into “good” or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the “Very good” category or better.

Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.

Payment History - 35%  
Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%  
New Credit Opened - 10%  
Credit Mix - 10%

What each category means and how to do well in each:

Payment History - How often have you made payments on time?

1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly.
2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history.
3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don’t close card accounts for this reason.

\*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*

Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you’re late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you’re only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)

Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)

1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit. Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit.
2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card.
3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase
4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don’t just make minimum payments.

Length of Credit History - How long is your average line of credit?

1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now.
2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit.
3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines. Ex. A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.

New Credit Opened - How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for “Length of Credit History”

Credit Mix - Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?  
1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit

cards) vs installment (loans). Ex. It’s better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards

Payment history is the most important by far and so it’s crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.

Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don’t want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.

Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.

Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)

Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.  
In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.

A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let’s say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!

Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don’t have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.

  

Example - A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:  
\*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\* Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)  
Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)  
Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)  
Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)  
Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)  
Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)

In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!

If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)

Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).

Example - $5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages) \*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*  
18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00  
20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07

25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43

Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.

By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don’t just save!

Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)

Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (“Post tax”)  
Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (“Pre tax”)

When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.

When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20’s and 30’s it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA

\*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*

Example #1 - Roth IRA

Income: $50,000  
Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000  
Amount at Retirement: $74,872

Example #2 - 401k

Income: $100,000  
Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000  
Amount at Retirement: $19,313

In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.

He comes from a blended family (so it’s his dad, stepmom and 3 sisters.) At the beginning, everything was good.. I got along with the family and quite enjoyed their company. Though I started to realize that his family would never really try to coordinate holidays with my side of the family. We were just sort of told when Christmas/Thanksgiving/Easter/Mother’s Day/Father’s Day lunches or dinners would be and would be expected to be there. For years, I attended all holidays and events that they organized and then I would pass by to see my family afterwards for coffee/dessert. My family never complained but sometimes, by the time we got there, a lot of my family members would have already left. There were times that I would spend time with his parents for fathers/mothers day rather than my own parents. 

Fast forward to when my husband and I (at the time boyfriend) were looking for a house together. His dad put his two cents into EVERYTHING. Told us what we need to have in the house, what we didn’t need, etc. I don’t mind the advice, but there were a lot of instances where my partner and I had decided on something, then he would talk to his dad and change his mind and THIS would cause disagreements between us. 

When we got engaged and were planning the wedding, his dad demanded we did this and that and everything in between. We decided to have a kid free wedding, he argued against it. We wanted the ceremony at 12, he argued against it. We decided to have a no shot wedding reception, he argued against it. We even decided against a late night station to save money, and his dad called me the week before the wedding and kept telling me I had to get a late night station for the guests! When I said that my fiancé and I discussed it and decided against it, he called the venue behind our back to find out how much it was. He tried to say to me that my husband was telling me no, but deep down he wanted this late night station. I eventually broke down from stress and just said ok. 

When it came to our house, my parents helped out financially and when we asked if his parents could help, they promised us a certain amount of money. 2 days before closing, we needed that money and they told us that they couldn’t afford to give it to us. (Meanwhile, they had ripped out their kitchen and fully renovated it, redid their front and backyard.) 

My parents helped out financially with the wedding, and again they said they couldn’t (and then proceeded to buy new trucks, expensive furniture for their house and take trips.) Now I would have no problem if they genuinely couldn’t afford to pitch in - everyone is in a different position financially. Though, it always appeared that they had money to spend for everything else AND they could also make demands. 

I had asked all his sisters to be bridesmaids in my wedding, because I wanted to get close and form a bond with them. One of his sisters in particular (I’m going to call her Jen,) barely came to any bridal get-togethers, rarely responded in the group chat and acted miserable most of the time. 

Flash forward to after the wedding, Jen started to become very different with me. At family get-togethers she would barely speak/look at me. I would try to still make conversation with her regardless, but there were times when I asked her a question and she wouldn’t even look up off her phone. Sometimes I texted her to ask her a question and she wouldn’t respond for 24 - 48 hours. I started to feel so awkward going to events with her there. Even my husband noticed it.  I spoke to his other sister about it (I’m going to call her Emily) and she said she noticed it as well. My husband’s father also noticed it. Despite all this, I continued to still try with her. 

Fast forward a year and a half, I got pregnant. Throughout my first trimester I was so sick/nauseous. Jen got engaged. She did not ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was a little upset because I really thought I would have been in the wedding party, (my husband was asked) but obviously accepted it. The closer it came to the wedding, I really wasn’t doing well with my pregnancy sickness. The family organized a mother’s day breakfast at 8am because his step-mother had to be at work, I told them I was not going to attend because I really didn’t feel well in the mornings. I sent her a message to wish her a happy mothers day that morning though and we still took part in the gift. My husband stayed home with me to make sure I was ok. Then Father’s day came, they organized another brunch, but I had plans to be with my father. So my husband went with his father and I went with mine. 

I also have to add in here that Emily is a big texter. She likes to make small talk through text everyday. She will start as early as 7:30am and go until 9pm at night. If there is a natural end to the conversation, she will start it back up again. She texted me every single day during my pregnancy asking me how I was feeling. At first I thought it was nice of her to think of me, but then it became overwhelming.  I am not a big texter, but I would just go with it because I knew she was being nice, but being nauseous and tired, I really just wanted to rest. Eventually, I did tell her twice, very subtly and politely that being on my phone was making me nauseous and I wasn’t a big fan of texting. She did not ease up on the texting. At one point my husband asked her to pull back a bit with the texting because I was getting overwhelmed, she still didn’t stop. She would also ask me every week to get together for coffee/walks and I would repeatedly say to her that I wasn’t up for it being so sick. She would ask me every day “are you feeling better today?” until I would just push myself and get together with her so I could then be left alone. (Of course this cycle repeated every new week.) 

For Jen’s wedding, I stayed home from the rehearsal as I was still super sick. My husband, who was in the wedding, went to the rehearsal but then didn’t stay for he dinner; he came home to make sure I was ok. Come the wedding day 2 days later, I attended the ceremony and the reception alone (because again, my husband was in the wedding). I was not only dealing with pregnancy sickness but I also had a cold. I still attended and stayed until after midnight and had a good time. When I got to the reception, my husband was so angry because he told me that they had organized family photos and no-one had told me to be there early to take part in it. The family photos were taken and I was not included. My husband also told me that they were going to announce “a special dance” after the couples first dance and tell everyone to “grab their someone special.” They told my husband that he was to go and grab his step-mother and to not tell me about it. I do not know why but I am glad my husband did tell me in advance so I wasn’t blind sided by this. The following morning, they did a dinner because it was nearing Jen’s birthday. I did not attend because I was throwing up and had a migraine, but I texted her wishing her a wonderful day and I was sorry I couldn’t make it. 

For our pregnancy, we decided to do a gender reveal party. We picked a date and told everyone about  it. My family was good to attend, his family told us that that date date wouldn’t work for them and that a different date would be better. So we rescheduled it. Then again, the new date was not good for them, so we rescheduled again…..and again. We had to reschedule our gender reveal party 3 times to accommodate them and which then meant that MY sister couldn’t attend. We planned it for 7pm. Emily texted us at 7pm when we were waiting for her and had told us she were going to be late and hadn’t even left the house yet. 

We got invited to Jen’s sister-in laws wedding. We were to RSVP online. I completely forgot about rsvping and the day after we were due to respond, Jen sent my husband and I a message saying “Wedding planning is stressful and we should not put any other unnecessary stress on the bride. The answer is yes or no, advise her now or respond to the wedding invite online.” At this point I had reached my limit. I sent Jen a message privately telling her that her message was unnecessarily rude and that she could have reminded us in a nicer way. I also said it seems that she had some sort of issue with me and I don’t know what I did. I told her that other people in the family noticed it and that she should tell me what I did because I was not going to feel uncomfortable and stressed out anymore while I was pregnant. 2 days later I got a 2 page text from her saying, giving me a timeline dating back 3 years of “everything I’ve ever done wrong,” saying I was entitled, disrespectful and I “came and went as I pleased” because I had missed a few events due to being sick while pregnant. I had shown disrespect to every single member of the family. She told me that I was “acting like a victim in a problem that I created.” There was no mention of the fact that the reason why I didn’t attend these few events was due to being pregnant and sick. There was no acknowledgement that for 8 years, we put my husband’s family first for all holidays and mine just got whatever time we had left over. 

Some more background information to note: my husbands father, as I said was very invasive in our relationship. Whenever we made a decision, he’d call my husband and try to make him change his mind or tell him that we should be doing something else. Some of our mail was still being sent to his house and he would open it and look through it (after being asked not to.) For weddings, he would call my husband up and ask how much money we were putting in the card - if he didn’t like what we decided on, he’d try to get him to put more. For our wedding, my husband had a stag and at the end of the night, my FIL took it upon himself to pay the venue girls a large amount of money, without discussing it with my husband. 

I got quite close to his sister Emily and would confide in her in a lot of personal things. When Jen sent me the 2 page text, a lot of the things I confided in Emily in were written in that text and were twisted to make me look bad. I came to realize that maybe I couldn’t trust Emily like I thought I could. 

I would ask the family to come to me with any important information instead of telling my husband because he always forgot and I wouldn’t get the info. I had been asking them to do this for years. They completely disregarded this and I would continue to find things out last minute, then they would blame me for “not communicating properly.” Emily would coordinate family gifts without asking us if we felt comfortable putting in certain amount  of money - she would just tell us the amount we owed for the gift. I told my husband that we would do our own gifts from now on to which he agreed. When he told Emily this, she was upset and asked him “why are you pulling away from the family?” 

Going back to the note from Jen, after receiving it, I didn’t respond because I felt I needed to remain stress free for the remainder of my pregnancy. So I left it alone. Emily pretended it never happened and when I asked to talk to her about it, she basically told me she agreed with everything that was written in the note. I reminded her that the things I was being blamed for (not attending events) weren’t being done to be rude or disrespectful, but because I was dealing with pregnancy sickness. She disregarded that.  

I struggled for a few weeks trying to comprehend being blamed for so much and being made out to be a problem in the family, when all I was trying to do was make it through a horrible first trimester. 

A few months later, I was having my baby shower, Jen did not attend nor did she send a gift or a card. Then she announced that she was pregnant, I sent her a congratulations text. 

Come this past thanksgiving, my husband and I decided that for once, we would attend the thanksgiving meal with my family and then pass by his family after. (Note, I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant at this stage.) We had dinner with my family and then left to go to his family. The other siblings were leaving, I said hi to Emily and I said hi to Jen (despite there being tension) to which she completely ignored and turned away from me. I shook it off, and we went into the house to visit with his parents. When we decided to go home, his parents said they want to talk to us. I figured it wold be about the tension with Jen. They then proceeded to rip into me for an hour and a half, saying I owed their daughter an apology.. how I was rude to not come to certain events, etc. I said, “but I didn’t come because I was sick.” To which my MIL said “I was pregnant once too.” I was crying the whole time and my MIL said she didn’t understand why I was so upset. I asked them if they saw the 2 page note Jen sent me after I had asked her to let me know what I had done to her, and they said yes they read it, but it was written out of “emotion.” Whereas my text to her, letting her know that her initial message to us was not very nice, was “hurtful.” (I will also note that my husband got very angry with his parents and was defending me the entire time.) I also have to mention here that after Emily and my father in law had both previously stated they saw how Jen acted towards me and noticed the tension - they now both said they never thought she had a problem with me, making me believe I imagine it. 

After an hour and a half of this, I said to my husband that I wanted to go. They tried to “comfort” me by saying they “cared about me.” They then proceeded to ask me “so do you want us to come to the hospital when you have the baby?”  
When we got home, I was so upset and my husband said it was time to take a break from his family. I told him that I love him but If it wasn’t for the baby, I would have to walk away from the marriage because I can’t deal with how invasive his family is. As of now, I am due in 2 - 3 weeks, and I have blocked his entire family. I have felt a lot more at peace and like I can breathe. His family has cause me immense stress this entire pregnancy and I just can’t take it anymore. I told my husband I want nothing to do with them for a while, and he understands. I do not know what to do when our baby is born because I know they will demand that they see their grandchild. 

Am I crazy/delusional or are they toxic and gaslighting me into thinking I’m the problem??  
(PS. There are a lot of other horrible things that they have done that I haven’t mentioned, but I promise I have not left anything out that I have done that would cause them to feel a certain way about me. I have always done everything they wanted, attended all events/holidays,(except the few when I was sick) participated in gifts, etc.)

# Tolomato Cemetery Tour

* Located on the site of an early 18th-century Franciscan Indian mission to the native Guale people, this Catholic cemetery dates back to St. Augustine's early history. Public access to the Tolomato Cemetery is limited, due to preservation concerns, to the third Saturday of each month, when guided tours are given from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
* The Tolomato Cemetery was the final resting place for people from a wide variety of cultures - Spanish, Cuban, Greek, Menorcan, African, Irish, and Haitian, just to name a few. It was closed to burials in 1884.
* The Tolomato Cemetery served as the parish cemetery for what is now the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine for more than 100 years. Though some 1,000 St. Augustinians are buried in the cemetery, there are only about 100 grave markers. What is known about who is buried there comes from the parish death records. The Cathedral parish and the Diocese of St. Augustine still own, maintain, and protect the cemetery.
* Some of the historically important people buried in the Tolomato cemetery are Bishop Agustin Verot, the first Bishop of St. Augustine, Governor Enrique White, who served during the Second Spanish Period, and General George Biassou of Haiti. Also buried here are the first Sisters of St. Joseph and Civil War soldiers from both sides of the conflict, including Freedmen who fought for the Union.
* Father Felix Varela of Cuba, who as a renowned teacher at the Cathedral of Havana seminary was an outspoken defender of human rights, and who later published the first Spanish-language newspaper in the U.S., was buried at Tolomato in 1853. The distinctive small white building in the cemetery is his chapel, built in his honor.
* **Admission:** Free, and donations are encouraged.
* **When:** 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on the third Saturday of the month.
* **Where:** The Tolomoto Cemetery is located at 14 Cordova Street, St. Augustine 32084

# Huguenot Cemetery Guided Tour

*  The Huguenot Cemetery is the oldest non-Catholic cemetery in Florida, having been 'founded' the year that Florida became a territory of the United States. It was a multi-racial, multi-ethnic public burial ground from 1821 to 1884. The Memorial Presbyterian Church has owned the cemetery since 1832. 
* The cemetery was first used for the interment of victims of the 1821 yellow fever epidemic and then for the burial of members of the newly arrived Protestant population. The oldest headstone is that of Johann George Happoldt who died August 15, 1821.  
* The Huguenot Cemetery is significant because it was one of the first steps to Americanize Florida. The burial traditions and funerary materials expressed at Huguenot are quite different from the nearby Tolomato Cemetery, which had been established by the Catholic Church in 1777. Because of this significance, the Huguenot Cemetery is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
* The Friends of the Huguenot Cemetery, Inc. opens the Huguenot Cemetery to the public on the third Saturday of each month from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Docents are on hand to answer questions.

# Tolomato Cemetery Tour

* Located on the site of an early 18th-century Franciscan Indian mission to the native Guale people, this Catholic cemetery dates back to St. Augustine's early history. Public access to the Tolomato Cemetery is limited, due to preservation concerns, to the third Saturday of each month, when guided tours are given from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
* The Tolomato Cemetery was the final resting place for people from a wide variety of cultures - Spanish, Cuban, Greek, Menorcan, African, Irish, and Haitian, just to name a few. It was closed to burials in 1884.
* The Tolomato Cemetery served as the parish cemetery for what is now the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine for more than 100 years. Though some 1,000 St. Augustinians are buried in the cemetery, there are only about 100 grave markers. What is known about who is buried there comes from the parish death records. The Cathedral parish and the Diocese of St. Augustine still own, maintain, and protect the cemetery.
* Some of the historically important people buried in the Tolomato cemetery are Bishop Agustin Verot, the first Bishop of St. Augustine, Governor Enrique White, who served during the Second Spanish Period, and General George Biassou of Haiti. Also buried here are the first Sisters of St. Joseph and Civil War soldiers from both sides of the conflict, including Freedmen who fought for the Union.
* Father Felix Varela of Cuba, who as a renowned teacher at the Cathedral of Havana seminary was an outspoken defender of human rights, and who later published the first Spanish-language newspaper in the U.S., was buried at Tolomato in 1853. The distinctive small white building in the cemetery is his chapel, built in his honor.
* **Admission:** Free, and donations are encouraged.
* **When:** 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on the third Saturday of the month.
* **Where:** The Tolomoto Cemetery is located at 14 Cordova Street, St. Augustine 32084

It was a multi-racial, multi-ethnic public burial ground from 1821 to 1884. The Memorial Presbyterian Church has owned the cemetery since 1832. 
* The cemetery was first used for the interment of victims of the 1821 yellow fever epidemic and then for the burial of members of the newly arrived Protestant population. The oldest headstone is that of Johann George Happoldt who died August 15, 1821.  
* The Huguenot Cemetery is significant because it was one of the first steps to Americanize Florida. The burial traditions and funerary materials expressed at Huguenot are quite different from the nearby Tolomato Cemetery, which had been established by the Catholic Church in 1777. Because of this significance, the Huguenot Cemetery is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Told her about it a while later, she was speechless. When I asked her If she was willing to go on a date sometime in the future however, she agreed. After that I didn't press the topic further as to figure things out for myself.

Since then she hasn't distanced herself from me, instead our conversations are more frequent and lengthy, especially as of late.

We were always very emotionaly intimate as in we talked about pretty much everything and hugging is pretty normal as well.

These last couple conversations however she started to initiate talking points way more on her own and texting went on for hours on end. Additionally she started asking me about difficult descisions in her work life. We work in the same field, however she is essentially my senior and she never did this before, usually helping me out.
Things like ""You'll be my deciding vote"" and such, which leads to long discussions about our responsibilities in the field, ethics and anxieties and such. Like that's work related, but answering those questions quickly becomes deeply personal, so If she intends to or not, she got to know me even better on some pretty heavy topics.
Also she has colleagues and close friends with as much if not more experience then herself, instead of me who is only getting started.

In our last meeting (which I did not consider a date, I haven't asked her yet) she told me at the end, that the last few months I've been beaming, while smiling directly at me. In that moment I kinda cracked and fumbled for words. I didn't really respond, though I think my feelings are pretty obvious.
I've been through some drastic change in that time, losing roughly 55lbs and advancing my carreer. 

She knows that what jumstarted the change was me catching feelings for her, I told her that from from the start. Though she could of course just be happy for me in general.

On that evening she also asked me to attend a party she was hosting. I had to decline due to another event, to which she replied with the Idea of hosting a second party.
When she invited me again to said 1st party a couple days ago, I told her I could attend for a short while, but I could also come over earlier and help her prepare (mostly cooking). She agreed with thanks but said we could also just go for some coffee at her place. Which again could mean something or nothing at all.

Like I know there is nothing specific, but I thought me telling her I have feelings for her would drastically change our dynamic, either her distancing herself from me or getting a bit flirty, I guess. Instead our relationship furthered in an unspecified direction in which we are even more emotionaly intimate with each other.

I know that she was in a long term relationship until last year, in which lack of emotional intimacy was kind of the nail in the coffin. 

In discussion on the topic we both agreed, that we do not want to lose each other, so I could understand her being cautious, but it could also just be her going with what's pretty natural to us.

We do not live together or share any expenses, so our money is completely separate. A year ago we worked together at a decent job, then I changed jobs to a much higher paying job with better shift flexibility. After I left my girlfriend started looking for other jobs so that we could be on the same schedule because she missed seeing me. We went from seeing each other almost everyday at work to usually twice a month for a few hours. She finally found one that had almost the same schedule but she took a $3 pay cut and a massive hour cut. She worked 6 days a week for 12 hours down to 5 days a week for 8 hours. When this happened almost all her money now goes to rent and fuel to get to work.
Today a few of my friends and I decided to hang out and I told her about it and she asked if she could tag along because she hasn't seen me in almost 2 weeks for more than 10 minutes. I agreed to let her come along. While hanging out we decided to go to lunch. We chose a fairly cheaply priced place. When we got there and started looking at the menu I noticed my girlfriend check her bank app and then look in her wallet. To avoid embarrassing her infront of my friends i text her asking if she had money to order anything and she told me all she had left was laundry money and a few extra dollars. I told her if she wanted to leave while we ate and then come back to where we were hanging out then I understood. She said she wanted to see me longer and decided to stay. When it came time for her to order she chose to just order a coffee and water. I guess everyone noticed this because later after she went back home everyone asked why she didn't eat with us. I explained the financial situation to them and how SHE chose to cut her hours and her pay. I told them that this is a life lesson for her and she needed to learn it. I did explain that when she is low on money like that and can't afford groceries I do get her raman and eggs so she has breakfast, lunch and dinner. They then proceed to call me an asshole because I do make around $10 or more dollars than her an hour and I could atleast buy her lunch but I'm already buying her food for her house. Am I really the A-Hole here? I think this is a good life lesson for her. I did ask her if she thought I was an A-Hole but she said she was just happy she got to see me.


EDIT:
When she had a good job she was able to out right buy a place to live apparently for ""us"" (it's a trailer but hopefully when she finishes it, it will seem more like a house to me because I wanted a real house), she bought land from her family, she bought a motorcycle so we could ride together and was able to go all out on holidays for me. I explained to her and even showed her that if she hadn't bought me things and shit to do with me then she could have put that money into savings and she would have had several thousand saved up. I even showed her because I've never bought her anything and I have several cars, multiple motorcycles and a boat. She said she bought the house so that we could save money together so we didn't have to rent when the time came for us to move in together but she left the good job before getting power hooked up so alot of good that's doing for ""us"" because I still have to pay rent for my place and she has to pay rent for her place. And for everyone telling me I need to leave her or she needs to leave me, I've told her that she isn't leaving me because she treats me better than anyone ever has and I'm not leaving her, ever.

It's super cute, but alas, I find the straps don't make it the most comfortable wear because it keeps sliding down, and the lack of an actual shape makes the experience of my almost hour long commute on the bus not very fun. It's now my gym bag, which I'm loving it for! I tried using the small cloud carry on for a bit, and while I like that it has more structure and holds everything I need as a chronic over-packer, it's comically large and it's not the most balanced bag and I get tired of lugging it around 20 minutes into my commute. 

I really love crossbody bags, and I was looking into getting the large crossbody as a work bag. What is your experience with using this bag, especially as a crossbody? Does it expand long enough to be an actual comfortable crossbody? 

These are some things that I would like to be able to carry in the bag:

* 32oz Owala
* Maybe a thermos with hot coffee on some days
* Kobo
* Notebook + pouch with stationary
* Earbuds/headphones
* Small pouch with daily makeup
* Pouch with essentials like hand lotion, lip balm, sanitizer etc.
* Keys (work + home)
* Portable charger
* Sunglasses pouch
* Lunchbag (it's not huge, just an insulated upright lunch bag, but ideally I'd like to be able to keep it in the bag and not have to carry a second bag in my hand, especially for when the Canadian winter starts)[ it's not exactly this bag, but this photo shows about the same size](https://ca.fluf.ca/cdn/shop/products/ZLU-OBLK-22_06_1799x.jpg?v=1698176889)!
* A couple reusable standard baggus
* And OCCASSIONALLY, my 14 inch Macbook Air and charging cable for days I might need it (which aren't often, as I primarily work from the office computer)

And yes, I know that a backpack is probably better for me in the long run, but I'm barely 5'2 and always feel like an overgrown toddler going to their 9 to 5 when I wear backpacks, and unfortunately, I've just never been a backpack girlie. I'll probably pay for that when I'm like 70. I'd love to see what anyone else is able to fit in their bag if they use it as a work bag or even as a daily bag.

1g6xtdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1g6xtdu/trip_report_14_days_firsttime_travelers/,[Trip Report] 14 days first-time travelers,"Hey everyone,

As a thank you to all of you who spend time answering questions from first-time travelers to Japan like me, I thought I’d report back on my first trip to Japan. My wife and I (33 and 36) traveled for the first time this month (Oct 4-18th) from the East Coast of the USA.

Flight / Immigration / Customs: United flight from Boston to Haneda. 1 stop at Newark and then 14h straight to Japan. We arrived at Haneda 2 PM on a Saturday. The lines were massive. It took us close to 2h to complete the whole process and leave the airport. I recommend that you fill out the Japan Web online forms a few days before your trip, take a screenshot of the QR code, and you’re all set. I saw many people struggling to fill out the paper forms or even connect to WiFi and do the online version while the line was moving. Plus the airport AC system in that area was awful, so it was quite hot. For those who usually run on the hotter side, I’d recommend a handheld fan or light clothing.

**GENERAL TIPS / OBSERVATIONS**

 

***Be an early bird:***

If sightseeing is your number 1 priority, then It pays well to get up early and go explore! We would get to most places around 8 am, and there would be hardly any crowds. Two examples of this were Kaminarimon / Senso-ji, and Kamakura as a whole. We could easily walk around, take pictures without any tourists around us, and take our time reading signs. The only downside to this is that stores open between 9-11am, so you don’t get to see that right away, but by the time you finish seeing the attraction, the stores around the temples/shrines start to open and you can focus only on shopping, then.

***IC card:***

Use IC card on your phone if you can.

Suica card in your phone makes life much, much easier. You can refill it online, avoiding having to stop at the service machines. You can also see your whole travel history and prices easily if needed (comes in handy in case you have an issue with a specific trip and need to reach out to an employee there for help, as it happened to us once). By using the Apple Wallet app, you can also avoid the madness at the airport, while everyone is trying to get their physical cards. If I’m not mistaken, as of September 24th of this year, now there’s also an Android version of the app. 

***Follow the flow:***

This is a big one. This applies to streets and train stations; there’s always the right path to follow (especially at train stations!). Make sure you’re looking down and seeing the signs on train stations on which path to follow, otherwise you will get caught counter flow of people trying to go one way while you’re going in the opposite direction. This pisses the Japanese folks who are always in a rush and walking fast (aka almost all Japanese folks, hahaha especially in Tokyo). I’ve noticed that on streets although there’s no rule, people also tend to take sides for incoming and outgoing pedestrian traffic, so keep an eye out and follow along!

***Trains:***

Trains are very busy from around 7-9AM, then 5-7PM in our experience. By busy I mean PACKED, sardine style. After that, there’s always quite a good number of people, but you can still find seats. Japanese folks seem obsessed with their phones. Almost if not all of them are constantly on it (we are most likely the same…), so they won’t even notice you, unless you are being loud, which is also a big no-no. But that doesn’t mean you can’t speak to your friends/family, just watch your tone. You all also probably read this a million times, but I want to reiterate it, trains are punctual! You will miss your train if you’re late by a minute, especially bullet trains.

Check how big is your station. Sometimes you might feel afraid of booking a trip that has a 5min layover to the next train, afraid that you’ll miss the next ride, but it might be totally fine. We had that fear going from Hakone to Kyoto, where there was a 5min layover at Mishima Station before boarding our next train to Kyoto Station. We decided not to take it in case it was a big station and it would take us time to navigate it/find our way. Turns out that the next boarding platform was just indeed less than 5min away. So we could have easily made it…

 

***Money exchange:***

Exchange most if not all of your money at the airport if you can, or only use your bank Card in an ATM like the ones at 7-11. For cash, the airport was by far the best exchange rate I saw in the city. From there is a massive drop. For instance, exchange rates for USD were 154 - $1 at the airport, while in Akihabara it was 137 - $1. If you can’t exchange or don’t want to exchange it all at the airport, tourist information centers are another good option. The Asakusa Culture tourist information center has a rate of 152 - $1.

 

***Get a pair of comfortable walking shoes***

Many folks have said this before, but seriously. It makes a whole difference. We walked an average of 25k steps per day, for 14 days. Good shoes made the whole difference. Also if you care about this, bring a pair of water-proof shoes as a backup for those rainy days. I personally hate the feeling of walking around with wet socks, so I always keep a second pair as backup. Those came in handy for those days in which it was raining all day and we were walking around all day. I recommend using the “runrepeat” website to help you decide, in case you’re like me and love reading reviews before buying something.

 

***Always have cash on you***

Japan is a big cash-only country. I’ve never experienced this before in any of the other countries I have visited. Temples and Shrines 90% of the time will be cash only (in our experience). Nothing worse than getting to the temple and having to walk back to find a money exchange ATM because you ran out of physical cash. The same goes for restaurants, a lot of the places we’ve been were cash-only. My recommendation would be to always have at least 2,000 yen per person on you all the time. This way you won’t find yourself in trouble to either eat or visit a place.

 

***Soap and trash bins***

Yes, Japan is very clean, and yes, there are not nearly enough trash bins around as one would have hoped for. Bring a bag with you because most likely you will be carrying your trash with you. We bought these quite handy nano bags. While not using it, it folds to the size of a mini-computer mouse, and we kept it in our sling bags. Tokyo restrooms in our experience always had soap to wash your hands, however, that was not the case for 90% of the restrooms we used in Kyoto. That said, we had bought these dehydrated soap sheets on Amazon that worked wonderfully! The whole package is the size of a Trident chewing gun pack and fits well in any purse or pocket. I will definitely keep this item as part of my luggage planning whenever I travel somewhere else again in the future.

 

**ITINERARY HIGHLIGHTS**

Here’s our itinerary for whoever wants to follow along or use it in the future:

[Wanderlog.com/view/mmnhfmrosr/trip-to-tokyo-and-kyoto/shared](http://Wanderlog.com/view/mmnhfmrosr/trip-to-tokyo-and-kyoto/shared)

TOKYO:

 **Day 2 (day 1 was arrival)**

Kaminorimon / Senso-ji area early morning to beat the crowds was a great decision! We got there and basically had most of the place just to ourselves. After seeing it, we stopped by the Tourist info center for a free city view, followed by a snack at Nakamise-dori street. By doing this we got to enjoy the attraction while it was empty, and by the time we were done with it and people started to come in in masses (9-10am), we could focus on exploring shops for food/gifts without a headache. This area is also within walking distance to a nearby market leading to Asakusa. This was not in our plans, but since we like exploring, we decided to do so and it paid out! Tons of food vendors, a Muji store, and the best Don Quijote store we visited in Tokyo.

 We very much enjoyed our time at the Ueno Park / Tokyo National Museum followed by strolling around the Ameyoko area for food, rather than strolling by Akihabara. That area was pure chaos, with too many people, and too many stores selling similar things. It was not an enjoyable experience for us. That said, if you’re big into the anime/gaming culture, you may prefer otherwise. It’s all about personal preference.

 

**Day 3**:

Meiji Shrine is beautiful! 100% worth visiting, and also paying the 500 yen fee to visit the garden. From there you can easily walk to Takeshita Street and the Omotesando area for lunch and shopping.

Shibuya crossing is worth seeing, BUT don’t waste your money at L’occitane cafe or Starbucks just to see folks crossing the street. Def not worth it. I’d much more recommend paying for the Shibuya Sky attraction at night, which gives you an amazing view of Tokyo, while you get a great view of Shibuya crossing.

 

**Day 4 Kamakura**:

 Beautiful place! I 1000% recommend going there as a daily trip from Tokyo. We arrived there at around 8am and went straight to the Tsurugaoka Hachimangu temple. We basically got the place entirely for ourselves. Beautiful view. After that, I’d recommend going straight to the Hasedera temple (maybe even switching orders with the Tsurugaoka), as you’ll likely again beat most of the crowds. This place also has tons of things to see. A MUST go. I mean, what other place you get to enter a cave with deities carved on its walls?! From there we stopped by Hokokuji Temple and enjoyed a peaceful matcha and sweets overlooking a bamboo forest almost all by ourselves. A 1000% worth experience and a great photo spot if you want to get that picture with a bamboo forest. Due to difficulty in accessing the area, we decided to skip the Sasuke Inari Shrine and went straight to the Kotoku-in area.

 The great Buddha at Kotoku-in is a must-see, but don’t bother going there first just to beat the crowds. That’s the only attraction to see in that area, where going to Hasedera first, instead, is a much better early-in-the-day experience with much more to do at that site.

End your day by looking for a snack or dinner, and shopping at Komachi-dori is a great way to end a nice day trip.

 

**Day 5:**

We started the day at a great bakery called No.4. Definitely worth it! The curry bread was delicious! I went there because I really wanted to try the place, but it was quite a bit of a commuter, so I only recommend it to folks around the area. Add to this a massive waste of time at the Shinjuku station trying to find the Odakyu sightseeing center to grab our Hakone-Kamakura day pass (a part of the station is under reform, so signage was awful), and we had to skip the Tsukiji market we had on our itinerary since it was already 2pm once we sorted it all out. So please plan ahead if you need to visit the station to exchange your tickets bought on Klook!

 That said we visited Hie Shrine instead and were glad we did! The place has a set of stars covered by Tori Gates that is beautiful to see! And we got it all for ourselves, not a single tourist was present. The shire itself is also beautiful. A nice contrast sandwiched between the skyscrapers of Tokyo.

 TeamLab borderless is a great experience, but only if you have the time to spare! If you’re staying 3+ nights in Tokyo, I definitely recommend going to it, and walking the mall after that if you’re into shopping at fancy places. Plus you’re a 10-20 minutes away (by foot) from the Tokyo Tower and the Zojo-ji Temple. All worth seeing.

 

**Day 6 - Hakone:**

Hakone is worth as a day to 1-night max trip. I would not spend more time than that, there. Going up the mountain, and tasting the black egg while enjoying the Mountain View is 100% worth it. We did the cruise ship ride and it was okay. I would not recommend folks to do it. What I would recommend 100% is the Open Air Museum. Beautiful area that mixes art and nature. We decided to skip the Hakone Shrine. I was not going to waste 1h of my day for a 5min picture.

 Aside from that, one big suggestion I’d give is to watch out for when you need to catch a train back to Tokyo or the surrounding areas. You will most likely rely on buses to get to the main train station, and there are not many going on at the same time. That said, if you book a hotel towards the end point of the bus stop path, you might find yourself stuck at the bus stop because the driver just passed straight through it since the bus was full. We stayed at Hakone Hotel (quite an old hotel, with very dated rooms, and a great view of the lake. I would not necessarily recommend this place) and it was at the beginning of the bus stop route, we passed by at least 2 stops where people were waiting in line to get on the bus, but the driver just passed straight on, since it was already packed.

 

**KYOTO** 

**Day 7**

We had originally planned to get early to Kyoto and visit the Kyoto National Museum (as described in the itinerary), but we decided to sleep in a little more, take a later bullet train, and spend the day walking around the Nishiki Market and the Pontocho area. Literally no plans, just walking around and see where that would take us. It was great!!

 

**Day 8:**

As you can see, day 8 was packed with shrines and temples. My highlight of this day was strolling in the empty AND fancy housing area around the Nanzen-ji Temple, where my wife and I came across a beautiful coffee shop called Mu-Monkan on Nanzenji Kusakawacho. The owner of the coffee shop was the kindest and most cheerful person we found throughout our whole trip to Japan. Her English was great, but most importantly, the freshly brewed coffee along with a delicious 20+ ingredient soup, AND freshly baked croissant were amazing! We spent quite a lot of time there talking about her life, her love for Gundan and other animes, and her experience as a tea ceremony master, while she was also asking us so many questions. We ended up exchanging Instagram profiles and are still in touch. On this day we also had our tea ceremony and sweet-making class at Maikoya, which was great. The staff were super friendly. Would recommend.

 

**Day 9:**

The highlights of this day were the Otagi and Jojakkoji temples. We chose to do these early in the day, while the weather was nice and no big crowds were around, and had a great time! By doing so, we obviously had a massive crowd at both Tenryu and the Arashiyama bamboo forest, which made the experience less enjoyable, but that’s okay. The bamboo forest experience in Kamakura was already 100% worth it, so we did not feel like we lost anything by having a crowded space here. Finally, Monkey Park was one of the big highlights of this trip for my wife. She was having so much fun there! I would 100% recommend this place, especially if you have kids, as I saw so many of them could not believe their eyes, once they saw the monkeys so close for the first time in their lives. Take the time to just enjoy the river and people watch while drinking a coffee or tea. We did this at the end of a busy day and it was so nice.

 

**Day 10:**

Highlights here were of course the Fushimi inari and going all the way to its top part, as well as the kinkaku-ji temple. After hitting these spots in the morning, we went to a bakery I was eager to visit called “Rau”, as I am big into baking. This place had by far one of the best desserts I have ever tasted in my life. I cannot recommend this place enough if you’re into sweets. After that, we took a train to our Ryokan “Biwako Hanakaido” which was also a fantastic experience. Both dinner and breakfast were quite unique, all with the support of a very friendly staff team. Another place I would recommend! They also have quite a of English English-speaking members on their team, if that’s important to you.

 

**Day 11:**

For me, the highlight of this day and maybe even the whole trip was the Sanjusangendo Temple and their 1001 statues. The place is so fantastic, and the sculptures are unbelievable. Plus it is not nearly as busy as its close neighbor Kiyomizu-Dera, which made the experience even more enjoyable. If you go to Kyoto, you must visit this temple!

 

**Day 12 – Nara**:

The highlight here has to be the deer. They are everywhere. The whole city is dominated by them. If feeding a deer, choose those that are alone, otherwise you will get surrounded. We saw many people getting bitten by them because they were not giving food away fast enough to the crowd of deer that surrounded them. It was also mating season, so we saw quite a bit of aggressive and very smelly males trying to find a mate. Also if you go to Nara, the Todai-Ji temple is a must-visit. I’ve never seen such an impressive temple as this one in all the days I was in Japan. What an impressive structure with so much history! If you for some reason feel like you must see the Mochi-making process at Nakatanidou, get there close to when they open, as they only do this up to a certain time in the day. We got there midafternoon and it was already done, but that’s fine, as we only wanted to taste it. We had a much better “dessert” experience eating a crème brulee sweet potato in a small shop not too far from that place.

Anyway, sorry for the massive post, but hopefully someone finds it helpful! Japan is an amazing country. I will remember this trip forever. Enjoy yourself, respect the culture and traditions of the locals, and most importantly, remember that this is a vacation, so don’t get too attached to your schedule. Use it more as a reference or guide rather than a must-do kinda place. Sometimes the best experiences are those you did not plan for.

I work a 9-5. Sometimes I don't sleep at all, usually once a week.","I work a standard 9-5 (mostly) work from home job. My typical day consists of waking up between 8am and 9am, finishing work around 5pm, and then going to sleep extremely late.

This week has been particularly bad:

* Sunday to Monday: didn't sleep. It got to around 6am and I decided to just stay up so I don't miss any meetings.
* Monday to Tuesday: fell asleep around 2am, woke up just before 9.
* Tuesday to Wednesday: went to sleep at around 6:30am, woke up feeling fine at around 9am.
* Wednesday to Thursday: can't remember.
* Thursday to today: went to sleep around 4am, woke up at today 8am.
* today: currently around 2am. Not feeling tired atm so will probably be another 4am one.

When my sleep schedule returns to 'normal', I always wake up feeling awful. If I'm at the stage where I'm falling asleep at 11pm or 12am for example, I'd sleep through my alarms and wake up late, sometimes not waking up until after 10. But when my sleep pattern gets to where it has been this past couple of weeks, I have no issue waking up. For example sleeping around 4am, and waking up at 7 without an alarm, feeling fine.

The worst it has ever got is me not sleeping at all for two nights straight. Not because I don't go to bed, but because I cant fall asleep. This is the stage where my schedule ends up 'correcting' itself, but it always ends up going back to how it is currently.

My husband and I have been married for 3 years but we have been together for almost 9 years. He comes from a blended family (so it’s his dad, stepmom and 3 sisters.) At the beginning, everything was good.. I got along with the family and quite enjoyed their company. Though I started to realize that his family would never really try to coordinate holidays with my side of the family. We were just sort of told when Christmas/Thanksgiving/Easter/Mother’s Day/Father’s Day lunches or dinners would be and would be expected to be there. For years, I attended all holidays and events that they organized and then I would pass by to see my family afterwards for coffee/dessert. My family never complained but sometimes, by the time we got there, a lot of my family members would have already left. There were times that I would spend time with his parents for fathers/mothers day rather than my own parents. 

Fast forward to when my husband and I (at the time boyfriend) were looking for a house together. His dad put his two cents into EVERYTHING. Told us what we need to have in the house, what we didn’t need, etc. I don’t mind the advice, but there were a lot of instances where my partner and I had decided on something, then he would talk to his dad and change his mind and THIS would cause disagreements between us. 

When we got engaged and were planning the wedding, his dad demanded we did this and that and everything in between. We decided to have a kid free wedding, he argued against it. We wanted the ceremony at 12, he argued against it. We decided to have a no shot wedding reception, he argued against it. We even decided against a late night station to save money, and his dad called me the week before the wedding and kept telling me I had to get a late night station for the guests! When I said that my fiancé and I discussed it and decided against it, he called the venue behind our back to find out how much it was. He tried to say to me that my husband was telling me no, but deep down he wanted this late night station. I eventually broke down from stress and just said ok. 

When it came to our house, my parents helped out financially and when we asked if his parents could help, they promised us a certain amount of money. 2 days before closing, we needed that money and they told us that they couldn’t afford to give it to us. (Meanwhile, they had ripped out their kitchen and fully renovated it, redid their front and backyard.) 

My parents helped out financially with the wedding, and again they said they couldn’t (and then proceeded to buy new trucks, expensive furniture for their house and take trips.) Now I would have no problem if they genuinely couldn’t afford to pitch in - everyone is in a different position financially. Though, it always appeared that they had money to spend for everything else AND they could also make demands. 

I had asked all his sisters to be bridesmaids in my wedding, because I wanted to get close and form a bond with them. One of his sisters in particular (I’m going to call her Jen,) barely came to any bridal get-togethers, rarely responded in the group chat and acted miserable most of the time. 

Flash forward to after the wedding, Jen started to become very different with me. At family get-togethers she would barely speak/look at me. I would try to still make conversation with her regardless, but there were times when I asked her a question and she wouldn’t even look up off her phone. Sometimes I texted her to ask her a question and she wouldn’t respond for 24 - 48 hours. I started to feel so awkward going to events with her there. Even my husband noticed it.  I spoke to his other sister about it (I’m going to call her Emily) and she said she noticed it as well. My husband’s father also noticed it. Despite all this, I continued to still try with her. 

Fast forward a year and a half, I got pregnant. Throughout my first trimester I was so sick/nauseous. Jen got engaged. She did not ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was a little upset because I really thought I would have been in the wedding party, (my husband was asked) but obviously accepted it. The closer it came to the wedding, I really wasn’t doing well with my pregnancy sickness. The family organized a mother’s day breakfast at 8am because his step-mother had to be at work, I told them I was not going to attend because I really didn’t feel well in the mornings. I sent her a message to wish her a happy mothers day that morning though and we still took part in the gift. My husband stayed home with me to make sure I was ok. Then Father’s day came, they organized another brunch, but I had plans to be with my father. So my husband went with his father and I went with mine. 

I also have to add in here that Emily is a big texter. She likes to make small talk through text everyday. She will start as early as 7:30am and go until 9pm at night. If there is a natural end to the conversation, she will start it back up again. She texted me every single day during my pregnancy asking me how I was feeling. At first I thought it was nice of her to think of me, but then it became overwhelming.  I am not a big texter, but I would just go with it because I knew she was being nice, but being nauseous and tired, I really just wanted to rest. Eventually, I did tell her twice, very subtly and politely that being on my phone was making me nauseous and I wasn’t a big fan of texting. She did not ease up on the texting. At one point my husband asked her to pull back a bit with the texting because I was getting overwhelmed, she still didn’t stop. She would also ask me every week to get together for coffee/walks and I would repeatedly say to her that I wasn’t up for it being so sick. She would ask me every day “are you feeling better today?” until I would just push myself and get together with her so I could then be left alone. (Of course this cycle repeated every new week.) 

For Jen’s wedding, I stayed home from the rehearsal as I was still super sick. My husband, who was in the wedding, went to the rehearsal but then didn’t stay for he dinner; he came home to make sure I was ok. Come the wedding day 2 days later, I attended the ceremony and the reception alone (because again, my husband was in the wedding). I was not only dealing with pregnancy sickness but I also had a cold. I still attended and stayed until after midnight and had a good time. When I got to the reception, my husband was so angry because he told me that they had organized family photos and no-one had told me to be there early to take part in it. The family photos were taken and I was not included. My husband also told me that they were going to announce “a special dance” after the couples first dance and tell everyone to “grab their someone special.” They told my husband that he was to go and grab his step-mother and to not tell me about it. I do not know why but I am glad my husband did tell me in advance so I wasn’t blind sided by this. The following morning, they did a dinner because it was nearing Jen’s birthday. I did not attend because I was throwing up and had a migraine, but I texted her wishing her a wonderful day and I was sorry I couldn’t make it. 

For our pregnancy, we decided to do a gender reveal party. We picked a date and told everyone about  it. My family was good to attend, his family told us that that date date wouldn’t work for them and that a different date would be better. So we rescheduled it. Then again, the new date was not good for them, so we rescheduled again…..and again. We had to reschedule our gender reveal party 3 times to accommodate them and which then meant that MY sister couldn’t attend. We planned it for 7pm. Emily texted us at 7pm when we were waiting for her and had told us she were going to be late and hadn’t even left the house yet. 

We got invited to Jen’s sister-in laws wedding. We were to RSVP online. I completely forgot about rsvping and the day after we were due to respond, Jen sent my husband and I a message saying “Wedding planning is stressful and we should not put any other unnecessary stress on the bride. The answer is yes or no, advise her now or respond to the wedding invite online.” At this point I had reached my limit. I sent Jen a message privately telling her that her message was unnecessarily rude and that she could have reminded us in a nicer way. I also said it seems that she had some sort of issue with me and I don’t know what I did. I told her that other people in the family noticed it and that she should tell me what I did because I was not going to feel uncomfortable and stressed out anymore while I was pregnant. 2 days later I got a 2 page text from her saying, giving me a timeline dating back 3 years of “everything I’ve ever done wrong,” saying I was entitled, disrespectful and I “came and went as I pleased” because I had missed a few events due to being sick while pregnant. I had shown disrespect to every single member of the family. She told me that I was “acting like a victim in a problem that I created.” There was no mention of the fact that the reason why I didn’t attend these few events was due to being pregnant and sick. There was no acknowledgement that for 8 years, we put my husband’s family first for all holidays and mine just got whatever time we had left over. 

Some more background information to note: my husbands father, as I said was very invasive in our relationship. Whenever we made a decision, he’d call my husband and try to make him change his mind or tell him that we should be doing something else. Some of our mail was still being sent to his house and he would open it and look through it (after being asked not to.) For weddings, he would call my husband up and ask how much money we were putting in the card - if he didn’t like what we decided on, he’d try to get him to put more. For our wedding, my husband had a stag and at the end of the night, my FIL took it upon himself to pay the venue girls a large amount of money, without discussing it with my husband. 

I got quite close to his sister Emily and would confide in her in a lot of personal things. When Jen sent me the 2 page text, a lot of the things I confided in Emily in were written in that text and were twisted to make me look bad. I came to realize that maybe I couldn’t trust Emily like I thought I could. 

I would ask the family to come to me with any important information instead of telling my husband because he always forgot and I wouldn’t get the info. I had been asking them to do this for years. They completely disregarded this and I would continue to find things out last minute, then they would blame me for “not communicating properly.” Emily would coordinate family gifts without asking us if we felt comfortable putting in certain amount  of money - she would just tell us the amount we owed for the gift. I told my husband that we would do our own gifts from now on to which he agreed. When he told Emily this, she was upset and asked him “why are you pulling away from the family?” 

Going back to the note from Jen, after receiving it, I didn’t respond because I felt I needed to remain stress free for the remainder of my pregnancy. So I left it alone. Emily pretended it never happened and when I asked to talk to her about it, she basically told me she agreed with everything that was written in the note. I reminded her that the things I was being blamed for (not attending events) weren’t being done to be rude or disrespectful, but because I was dealing with pregnancy sickness. She disregarded that.  

I struggled for a few weeks trying to comprehend being blamed for so much and being made out to be a problem in the family, when all I was trying to do was make it through a horrible first trimester. 

A few months later, I was having my baby shower, Jen did not attend nor did she send a gift or a card. Then she announced that she was pregnant, I sent her a congratulations text. 

Come this past thanksgiving, my husband and I decided that for once, we would attend the thanksgiving meal with my family and then pass by his family after. (Note, I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant at this stage.) We had dinner with my family and then left to go to his family. The other siblings were leaving, I said hi to Emily and I said hi to Jen (despite there being tension) to which she completely ignored and turned away from me. I shook it off, and we went into the house to visit with his parents. When we decided to go home, his parents said they want to talk to us. I figured it wold be about the tension with Jen. They then proceeded to rip into me for an hour and a half, saying I owed their daughter an apology.. how I was rude to not come to certain events, etc. I said, “but I didn’t come because I was sick.” To which my MIL said “I was pregnant once too.” I was crying the whole time and my MIL said she didn’t understand why I was so upset. I asked them if they saw the 2 page note Jen sent me after I had asked her to let me know what I had done to her, and they said yes they read it, but it was written out of “emotion.” Whereas my text to her, letting her know that her initial message to us was not very nice, was “hurtful.” (I will also note that my husband got very angry with his parents and was defending me the entire time.) I also have to mention here that after Emily and my father in law had both previously stated they saw how Jen acted towards me and noticed the tension - they now both said they never thought she had a problem with me, making me believe I imagine it. 

After an hour and a half of this, I said to my husband that I wanted to go. They tried to “comfort” me by saying they “cared about me.” They then proceeded to ask me “so do you want us to come to the hospital when you have the baby?”  
When we got home, I was so upset and my husband said it was time to take a break from his family. I told him that I love him but If it wasn’t for the baby, I would have to walk away from the marriage because I can’t deal with how invasive his family is. As of now, I am due in 2 - 3 weeks, and I have blocked his entire family. I have felt a lot more at peace and like I can breathe. His family has cause me immense stress this entire pregnancy and I just can’t take it anymore. I told my husband I want nothing to do with them for a while, and he understands. I do not know what to do when our baby is born because I know they will demand that they see their grandchild. 

Am I crazy/delusional or are they toxic and gaslighting me into thinking I’m the problem??  
(PS. There are a lot of other horrible things that they have done that I haven’t mentioned, but I promise I have not left anything out that I have done that would cause them to feel a certain way about me. I have always done everything they wanted, attended all events/holidays,(except the few when I was sick) participated in gifts, etc.)

As in the title, my partner and I have been together for 18 years now - since we were both teenagers.

When we met she had dropped out of high school due to suffering from depression. A mutual friend set us up on a date and we hit it off immediately and started dating soon after. Her depression made things difficult, especially when it meant she didn't always want to see my family or meet up with my friends, but we got on so well that I wanted to support her through it. There were lots of tough times, but we managed to stick together when I went off to college in a neighboring state (only around 2 hours drive). She started working at a coffee shop during this time and we would visit each other back and forth. Working like this gave her some more self confidence and it seemed like her depression was getting better over time, though there were still lots of emotional support things she relied on me for.

We had some intimacy issues from early on. Some of them were bought in from me given an issue in a past relationship, and some of them were due to a medical condition she had. Eventually we settled on a better place with this but it has never been consistently incredible.

What our relationship had, and has always had, is loads of fun. We get on really well, we have the same sense of humour and we enjoy each others company. We like lots of the same hobbies so can share in lots of things.

After graduating, we moved into a rented apartment together in our local city, and while I was working too hard in my first job which sometimes put a strain on things, we held it together until eventually we bought a small apartment together thanks to her inheriting some money. She was working in a very low paid job so before long I started to pay for the lions share of things in the house as my earnings increased quickly.

Eventually, she decided to quit her job as she didn't enjoy it and the progression wasn't good, and become a physiotherapist. The training took a long time and she wasn’t earning during this period. Her depression got really bad again around this time, and for a long period she wasn't really working except for a couple of clients that she had through networks. I supported her during this time and started to pay all of the household bills and all of the mortgage.

My job at this time was also a bit stressful - it was a small firm and I was taking on too much work, even if the pay was good. She decided to use the rest of the money she inherited to go travelling, and gave me an ultimatum that if I didn't come she was going alone. This put a massive strain on the relationship, and we were not very happy together for a long period.

Eventually I decided that if she went alone, it could lead to the end of the relationship, so I quit and went with her and we rented out the apartment for a year. We were really happy while we were travelling, and this is the standard story of our relationship - when the pressure of normal adult life is off we are happy, but when its tough things get harder.

We came back and her physiotherapy business seemed to be taking off and I got a new, less stressful job. We had spent all our savings so financial pressures were high, and I have always had huge stress that is generated by money. Neither of us are very good at handling our spending - we spend too much on take out and are not very good at saving, so this doubles up my stress. At this time I was still paying all our bills as her earnings were not enough for much apart from her personal spending money. But it felt like things were better after the travelling and perhaps she would earn more over time.

Then Covid hit and her business went to 0. My new company was distressed and I was worried I would be fired. Times were tough as they were for everyone and her depression got much worse, to the point where eventually even in the year after Covid she was struggling to leave the house sometimes. Our sexual relationship broke down a bit here and never really recovered as much as it had prior to Covid likely due to all the stress. I tried my hardest to support her through this time, and things got a little better as she changed her medication.

We realised during Covid we needed more space and I thought getting out of our tiny apartment would be good for her, so we found and purchased a house even though that was a stretch on our finances. We didn't have enough money to pay contractors to do everything except major works, and I am quite handy, so we decided we would do it up together seeing as she has lots of free time. Unfortunately buying a property that needed lots of work made her stressed and have a breakdown. She couldn't even go to the house while it was being renovated. During my full time job I had to do all the works, which meant doing a 45 hour week then putting all evenings and weekends into the home for 4. It was the most difficult time of my life and I was also emotionally supporting her at home when I got in.

We eventually moved in and things got better for a while, but our sex life did not improve. We got two dogs (which was one of her lifelong dreams) she started working a little more, but got into holistic therapies and decided to retrain as a holistic practitioner, so I paid for the courses to do that. Unfortunately that work was quite highly competed in our area so it has never bought in much money and she decided the physiotherapy work was not something she wanted to do any more. She started to put on weight during this time, and while I didnt want her to feel bad about it, it did reduce how attracted I am to her. She also started dressing differently, a more alternative ""hippy"" look, one that I don't really find very flattering. She also started to get annoyed at me sometimes when I didn't want to engage or agree with her on some of her views on holistic therapy (for instance, whether the Tarot is real). However, during this time the medication really started to work well and her depression was more managed.

About 3 months ago, we had a huge argument about our lack of sex life, and I realised in the moment that my side of it was because I feel like the adult in our relationship. All our money is money I make, and then we split everything else around the home 50/50 except the dogs which she cares for as I am unable to take them into the office. She took this incredibly poorly and angrily and shut down and didn't want to talk about it. Since then she's been passive aggressive about it but has made more effort in her business and keeps saying she's trying. She asked me to go to therapy to figure my head out, and to see if I have sex and intimacy issues, and I have been doing that for the past month. She doesn't seem to want me to to make any other changes in the relationship and seems happy with everything but our sex life.

She has no input into the finances whatsoever and even when I am tearing my hair out worried she doesn't want to. I have sat her down and tried to show her the numbers but her eyes glaze over and she says she's too tired. But she still constantly asks for things that we can't afford, then gets frustrated when I say ""no"". For instance, she would like a new car and even though I have said we cannot afford it multiple times she brings it up at every opportunity. When I asked her straight to get more involved in our finances she said her friends partners manage their money - but all of her friends are also earners in their relationships! She also seems to buy lots of clothes and daytime takeaways and other small purchases without telling me on our shared credit card now. I don’t want to restrict her spending but it feels like she’s doing it without any knowledge of what it means for our finances - if she spends $80 on a dress that’s money we don’t have for a new car!

I've also been trying to change my life a bit. I feel like things are stale - I've been going to the gym to try and improve my fitness and seen good results already. She seems happy to watch lots of reality TV and cuddle in front of the sofa but I want to do more with my life. I want to start my own business and read more and spend more time with friends and on hobbies, but it feels like she is just frustrated by that. I love doing things together, like activities, but it feels like what she wants is just 1-1 time spent in bed cuddling. I feel like we just don't align in that way any more (but maybe that has always been true in our relationship). Whenever I come in from work she wants all my time and attention, because some days I’m the first person she has seen that day, but I want to use that time differently.

I've stopped wanting to be intimate with her on any level. I'm struggling to articulate to her what I feel because of how angry she got last time I tried. She got so angry with me she almost left the other day, but then returned to the home and said she wanted to fight for us and I said I wanted to as well but things had to change. I just feel like the partnership is so unequal and I am struggling to not feel like a guardian rather than a partner.

But I have never experienced adult life without her, and she is still my best friend. I love her and I'm scared of what breaking up with her would do to her - whether it would destroy all the progress she has made with her mental health. I don't know how she would support herself financially without me (her parents could help but in the longer term). Plus we have the house, and the dogs, so the logistics feel really challenging in themselves.

I'm scared of being single too. I have no idea what a dating app even looks like. I have some idea that some women might find me attractive but I'm scared of being alone. The idea of ""going backwards"" given I'm 34 feels terrifying.

I don't really know what I'm hoping for in writing this. I'm already in therapy but I just feel so unable to move forwards. No matter what path I take, whether I leave or stay, it feels like there is a painful path ahead. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has trodden a similar path.",21,1729300514.0,self,7,1.0,False

2. When difficulties arise, see them as your dharma 
3. Turn the wound into light 
This immediately takes me back to Rumis rapturous quote “the wound is where the light enters you”

The recounting of the life of Marion Woodman in chapter nine moved me deeply. 
Ive found my eyes pregnant with tears of inspiration and awe in the middle of a crowded coffee shop. 

The last couple of paragraphs of chapter nine where Cope speaks of Marion’s feverous passion to dance in spite of her decaying condition has seemed to inspire something deep within me. 
Her relentless willingness to embrace her fate (her dharma) possesses a spirit that tears straight through my heart. 
I never knew this woman and as a lover of Jung I’m even shamed to admit I had never even heard of her before reading this book, but Cope articulates her spirit in a manner that brings her to life in my minds eye. 
Through fully embracing the beauty and the horror of life, her spirit has seemingly touched something deep in my soul. 

Cancer terrifies me. 
I had skin cancer, my elderly father moved through prostate cancer and my brother through testicular cancer all in the same year. 
It really scares me. 
And it’s everywhere. 
Sickness and pestilent disease. 
It shakes me to my core. 
So it’s no wonder that reading about the spirit in which Marion embraced this dharma touched something deep down. 
She turned the wound into light. 
She turned it into to so much light hearing her story second hand ripped my heart apart and put it back together. 
This is the aim. 
To embrace life so fully that the vicissitudes of existence are a conduit to fullness and completion.

1g6xkbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/comments/1g6xkbi/experience_fabric_shopping_in_tokyo/,Experience fabric shopping in Tokyo,"Wanted to share my experience fabric shopping in Tokyo. I’m getting back into sewing after many years apart, so my goals were pretty simple. I wanted to find some knits to make clothes for my daughter, and some cute cottons for bags/pouches, so my experience will be skewed from garment sewers. 

Shops I visited:

* **Tomato main shop:** this is where I bought all my fabric. First and fifth floor had such a great variety of printed cottons, almost everything under the 1000yen mark (licensed fabrics like hello kitty and moomin were 1700). I also found a really impressive selection of coated cotton which I picked up to make tote bags (west coaster so lots of rain). Really disappointed almost all their knits were plain or monochrome stripes. Good selection of notions like pens, pins, etc. lots of cheap fat quarters too (I think 250yen) but all American cottons so I skipped.
* **tomato select-kan:** huge selection of beautiful wools and tweeds on the 2nd floor. They had a small but nice selection of scissors and patterns as well vs the other stores.  They must switch up the selection here based on the season, because from YouTube videos I saw they had a lot more printed cottons and other materials here.
* **tomato discount shop:** hard to navigate if you can’t read Japanese (I can read alphabets, but not Chinese characters) so I didn’t spend much time here as it was less organized.  BUT worth a quick stop since everything is so cheap.
* **tomato haberdashery/notions shop:** tons of buttons/fasteners/etc along with some knitting supplies, they also had some cool sashinko kits and tons of fun patches and labels for your me mades 
* **craft apartment:** this has a really great selection of pattern books that are very reasonable. cash only shop.
* **humongous:** beautiful selection of Japanese cottons, but they were 3000 a meter so I moved on quickly. If you want something really unique though, highly suggest coming here for a splurge. 
* **alon:** heard they had bamboo knits here, but it was definitely geared towards women’s clothing. Small but well organized with sample charts of each fabric. 

General tips:

* in tomato, fabric minimum is .5m then can be bought in 10cm increments thereafter
* no tax free at tomato
* **BIGGEST TIP:** I personally get so overwhelmed with choice. So I went, took lots of photos and notes, then went for coffee and narrowed down my choices before going back to buy. I’m so glad I did this BUT word of warning, your fabric may have moved by the time you get back!
* in tomato you line up to cut then line up to pay. 
* centimetre in Japanese is “senchi” and meter is “meeta”. Helpful to look up 10, 20, 30, etc in Japanese
* If you're looking at patterns for kids clothes, keep in mind Japanese babies/toddlers tend to be shorter and chunkier.  My daughter is the opposite, so any clothes I've bought her from here don't fit well.

What I bought:

* The big pieces are waxed cotton, 1500yen/m
* Printed cotton for pouches, 350yen/m and 700yen/m
* Good scissors, thread snippers, marking pen, seam ripper, and knitting needle caps
* 2 pattern books - the first shows how to make any variation of a basic tote bag  for 1300yen (sizes, depth, handle length, closure type), the other had some funky ideas like a round bag for 1600yen",1,1729299839.0,sewing,1,1.0,False

We moved in together about 7 months ago and I moved almost 300 miles away from my family.

So I 27m have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 29F for almost two years now. She has 3 kids from previous relationships that I have decided to help raise as my own. Now our bedroom isn’t exactly dead “we do it at least twice a week”. But it feels like there is no spark or passion. It feels very mechanical and one sided. I put in most of the effort and try to do everything she likes “I give her lots of oral”. Ect…. But all she does is lay there she doesn’t make any noise and she only wants to fool around in the missionary position. Anytime I suggest trying something new she will either shut me down instantly or give me some excuse as to why she doesn’t want to try it.As I said before I have given her oral many times “10+ minutes” each time but I have only received it once and it was for less then “two minutes”.the entire time we have been together. 
 
  I have tried to bring it up to her a few times and every time I have she gets super defensive and it turns in a fight. She will tell me that she’s just timid in the bed. It feels like I am the one to always initiate our intimacy and most of the time she shoots me down. I have tried everything that I can think of to make sure she is having a good day and I go out of my way to do nice things for her. Like bringing her coffee when she’s at work or buying her favorite food or even taking her out to fancy dinners but even after all that effort it still feels like she doesn’t want to be intimate. I have tired asking many times if she doesn’t enjoy it and I get the same response “If I didn’t like it we wouldn’t be doing it”

   At this point I don’t know what my next steps should be. This is the first relationship that I have been in where our bedroom situation has been this way. I’m getting to the point where I’m almost more tempted to use my hand than try to be intimate with her. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Am I making a huge mistake?,"TLDR: I feel like my partners guardian rather than a romantic relationship, but I'm scared to hurt her and of what life looks like without her.

As in the title, my partner and I have been together for 17 years now - since we were both teenagers.

When we met she had dropped out of high school due to suffering from depression. A mutual friend set us up on a date and we hit it off immediately and started dating soon after. Her depression made things difficult, especially when it meant she didn't always want to see my family or meet up with my friends, but we got on so well that I wanted to support her through it. There were lots of tough times, but we managed to stick together when I went off to college in a neighboring state (only around 2 hours drive). She started working at a coffee shop during this time and we would visit each other back and forth. Working like this gave her some more self confidence and it seemed like her depression was getting better over time, though there were still lots of emotional support things she relied on me for.

We had some intimacy issues from early on. Some of them were bought in from me given an issue in a past relationship, and some of them were due to a medical condition she had. Eventually we settled on a better place with this but it has never been consistently incredible.

What our relationship had, and has always had, is loads of fun. We get on really well, we have the same sense of humour and we enjoy each others company. We like lots of the same hobbies so can share in lots of things.

After graduating, we moved into a rented apartment together in our local city, and while I was working too hard in my first job which sometimes put a strain on things, we held it together until eventually we bought a small apartment together thanks to her inheriting some money. She was working in a very low paid job so before long I started to pay for the lions share of things in the house as my earnings increased quickly.

Eventually, she decided to quit her job as she didn't enjoy it and the progression wasn't good, and become a physiotherapist. The training took a long time and she wasn’t earning during this period. Her depression got really bad again around this time, and for a long period she wasn't really working except for a couple of clients that she had through networks. I supported her during this time and started to pay all of the household bills and all of the mortgage.

My job at this time was also a bit stressful - it was a small firm and I was taking on too much work, even if the pay was good. She decided to use the rest of the money she inherited to go travelling, and gave me an ultimatum that if I didn't come she was going alone. This put a massive strain on the relationship, and we were not very happy together for a long period.

Eventually I decided that if she went alone, it could lead to the end of the relationship, so I quit and went with her and we rented out the apartment for a year. We were really happy while we were travelling, and this is the standard story of our relationship - when the pressure of normal adult life is off we are happy, but when its tough things get harder.

We came back and her physiotherapy business seemed to be taking off and I got a new, less stressful job. We had spent all our savings so financial pressures were high, and I have always had huge stress that is generated by money. Neither of us are very good at handling our spending - we spend too much on take out and are not very good at saving, so this doubles up my stress. At this time I was still paying all our bills as her earnings were not enough for much apart from her personal spending money. But it felt like things were better after the travelling and perhaps she would earn more over time.

Then Covid hit and her business went to 0. My new company was distressed and I was worried I would be fired. Times were tough as they were for everyone and her depression got much worse, to the point where eventually even in the year after Covid she was struggling to leave the house sometimes. Our sexual relationship broke down a bit here and never really recovered as much as it had prior to Covid likely due to all the stress. I tried my hardest to support her through this time, and things got a little better as she changed her medication.

We realised during Covid we needed more space and I thought getting out of our tiny apartment would be good for her, so we found and purchased a house even though that was a stretch on our finances. We didn't have enough money to pay contractors to do everything except major works, and I am quite handy, so we decided we would do it up together seeing as she has lots of free time. Unfortunately buying a property that needed lots of work made her stressed and have a breakdown. She couldn't even go to the house while it was being renovated. During my full time job I had to do all the works, which meant doing a 45 hour week then putting all evenings and weekends into the home for 4. It was the most difficult time of my life and I was also emotionally supporting her at home when I got in.

We eventually moved in and things got better for a while, but our sex life did not improve. We got two dogs (which was one of her lifelong dreams) she started working a little more, but got into holistic therapies and decided to retrain as a holistic practitioner, so I paid for the courses to do that. Unfortunately that work was quite highly competed in our area so it has never bought in much money and she decided the physiotherapy work was not something she wanted to do any more. She started to put on weight during this time, and while I didnt want her to feel bad about it, it did reduce how attracted I am to her. She also started dressing differently, a more alternative ""hippy"" look, one that I don't really find very flattering. She also started to get annoyed at me sometimes when I didn't want to engage or agree with her on some of her views on holistic therapy (for instance, whether the Tarot is real). However, during this time the medication really started to work well and her depression was more managed.

About 3 months ago, we had a huge argument about our lack of sex life, and I realised in the moment that my side of it was because I feel like the adult in our relationship. All our money is money I make, and then we split everything else around the home 50/50 except the dogs which she cares for as I am unable to take them into the office. She took this incredibly poorly and angrily and shut down and didn't want to talk about it. Since then she's been passive aggressive about it but has made more effort in her business and keeps saying she's trying. She asked me to go to therapy to figure my head out, and to see if I have sex and intimacy issues, and I have been doing that for the past month. She doesn't seem to want me to to make any other changes in the relationship and seems happy with everything but our sex life.

She has no input into the finances whatsoever and even when I am tearing my hair out worried she doesn't want to. I have sat her down and tried to show her the numbers but her eyes glaze over and she says she's too tired. But she still constantly asks for things that we can't afford, then gets frustrated when I say ""no"". For instance, she would like a new car and even though I have said we cannot afford it multiple times she brings it up at every opportunity. When I asked her straight to get more involved in our finances she said her friends partners manage their money - but all of her friends are also earners in their relationships! She also seems to buy lots of clothes and daytime takeaways and other small purchases without telling me on our shared credit card now. I don’t want to restrict her spending but it feels like she’s doing it without any knowledge of what it means for our finances - if she spends $80 on a dress that’s money we don’t have for a new car!

I've also been trying to change my life a bit. I feel like things are stale - I've been going to the gym to try and improve my fitness and seen good results already. She seems happy to watch lots of reality TV and cuddle in front of the sofa but I want to do more with my life. I want to start my own business and read more and spend more time with friends and on hobbies, but it feels like she is just frustrated by that. I love doing things together, like activities, but it feels like what she wants is just 1-1 time spent in bed cuddling. I feel like we just don't align in that way any more (but maybe that has always been true in our relationship). Whenever I come in from work she wants all my time and attention, because some days I’m the first person she has seen that day, but I want to use that time differently.

I've stopped wanting to be intimate with her on any level. I'm struggling to articulate to her what I feel because of how angry she got last time I tried. She got so angry with me she almost left the other day, but then returned to the home and said she wanted to fight for us and I said I wanted to as well but things had to change. I just feel like the partnership is so unequal and I am struggling to not feel like a guardian rather than a partner.

But I have never experienced adult life without her, and she is still my best friend. I love her and I'm scared of what breaking up with her would do to her - whether it would destroy all the progress she has made with her mental health. I don't know how she would support herself financially without me (her parents could help but in the longer term). Plus we have the house, and the dogs, so the logistics feel really challenging in themselves.

I'm scared of being single too. I have no idea what a dating app even looks like. I have some idea that some women might find me attractive but I'm scared of being alone. The idea of ""going backwards"" given I'm 34 feels terrifying.

I don't really know what I'm hoping for in writing this. I'm already in therapy but I just feel so unable to move forwards. No matter what path I take, whether I leave or stay, it feels like there is a painful path ahead. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has trodden a similar path.",1,1729299323.0,relationship_advice,1,0.6,False

Not trying to be a negative influence on this subreddit.,"I recently experienced something that hit me in a nasty way. I was talking to this girl I met through an anonymous love letter page at my university. I texted her, “Hey, it's me, the guy who posted the love letter, how you doin’?” She replied, “Hey, thank you for the post, it made my day.” So I thought things were going well and said, “Cool, wanna grab a coffee sometime?” And then… taadaaa ghosted.

The worst part? She was super interested when I was anonymous, but the moment she found out I’m of South Asian descent, she ghosted me.

This has become the disgusting reality? I’m a 19M who came to this country 6 years ago and worked hard to assimilate. I’ve adapted, balanced different worlds, and found my place here. No stereotypical accent, none of that. But it’s crazy how fast people can make assumptions based on where you come from.

It made me realize just how deep these stereotypes run. People judge without ever getting to know you. I’m more than the box someone wants to shove me into because of where my family comes from.

And honestly, this feels like the result of the nasty Western propaganda that’s been pushed into their heads. It’s sad to see how quickly people fall for it and lose sight of what really matters who you are as a person.

This sucks, ghosting sucks, but what sucks even more is knowing that the reason behind it is something so shallow and unfair.

If it is this bad for me Imagine how bad it must be for the International students who were literally told distorted history to make them worship the white and western culture.  Imagine generalising an entire diaspora because of the actions of a few. 

But the fact that we still are the richest migrant groups that's what matters and that's the reason they might be so insecure of us. Even the social media posts are targeted to dehumanise the Indian subcontinent.

October seventeenth, a day that will live on in human, no, *galactic* history…



When we got home yesterday, I was very grateful that the elevator in the building was big enough for me to fit. No way I was hurling myself up all those stairs with my busted leg! On our way out I asked to keep the Gojid quill that almost pierced my artery as a keepsake, it took some whining but eventually, they let me take it home after they put it in an obscenely thick bio-bag.

It also took some whining to Yua for her to let me hobble out to the living room today. I know lying down would probably be for the best but I didn’t want to be alone in this room! *It reminds me too much of my night terrors…*Besides, we don't even have a TV in here! 



“I thought that picture you had the doctor take was enough of a keepsake,” Yua questioned why I kept the quill. “Well, maybe the fella wants it back!” I joked as I took the quill out of the bag.

In reality, I just found it interesting, and besides how else was I supposed to get one? “Oh hey sir, you mind if I yank a few spikes out ‘cha back?” isn’t exactly a convincing sell. 



“You humans are weird” she commented as she took it upon herself to cook tonight's dinner, she didn’t let me get up for anything unless it was to hobble to the bathroom.

“you're just jealous I got a Gojid quill and you don't! It’s a battle trophy!” I heard Yua let out a few whistles at that “Oh my vicious predator warrior, what will I do with you?” she chimed amused.



With the news no longer being a soul-crushing weight of uncertainty, I could finally try and enjoy some alien television. *Never have I wanted to avoid talk shows anymore!* I flipped through the channels until I found the wonder that is Venlil game shows! 

I was starting to enjoy the cultural exchange now! They had a certain silliness and over-the-topness that reminded me of Japanese game shows but with fuzzy space-sheeps running around. I found myself actually laughing at the show which made me feel a little old.



“Your people got some great TV Yua” I commented, her tail swished and her ears peaked “I'm glad you think so, maybe you can show me some human shows sometime” “Compared to this, I think you’ll find human shows rather dry” “oh *you're* rather dry! That glass of water better be empty when I'm done!” 

She had a stern motherly tone to her, it made any doubts about her motives evaporate “Yes Mom” I snickered. “Watch it, keep it up and I’ll make you do the dishes by hand and clean our room” I found it a bit odd how she called it *our* room but she wasn’t wrong 

“in my weak, feeble state? Oh you're so mean to me Yua” I went back and put my arm across my head being over-dramatic “Yep, I'm just that evil” she replied with a little snicker.



I was concerned that maybe we were getting too comfortable with each other too fast, but at least it meant she wasn’t afraid to humor me, snap back, and take a stern tone with me. I guess I really must be her favorite patient. 

I felt like the luckiest human to have someone like Yua, I probably have no one left...*why has no one called me? ...N-No! Happy thoughts! Think about friends! S*ure I had ‘friends’ at the old office who were evacuated as well...but that friendship ends when the workday does.

I had a few friends outside of work but I don't think I could stomach the possibility of something having happened to them, not right now. As I sipped the water as my doctor ordered I leaned back on the couch, thinking back at how my last few weeks on earth were spent living at my workstation, *as we all were!* 



*Every time we'd slow or start to fall behind the extreme deadlines and quotas, there would be a branch-wide meeting, hammering home how an alien threat could threaten our home at a moment's notice! And how it’d be worth it once we’re done playing catch up with the rest of the galaxy!*

*Anyone who still wasn’t ‘reinvigorated’ by increasingly hollow speeches, overtime pay, free food, coffee, energy drinks, prostitutes, and drugs were replaced. I don't know what happened to them, horrible rumors were squashed as soon as they popped up.*

*Anyone caught speaking too much of their mind was berated publicly and anyone who went to the press coincidentally had illegal content at their workstations and home computers.*



*Our office was run like its own little dictatorship! Managers and above were like party members, whips were brought in too keep order! We weren't allowed to leave the building after a certain point! They called it ‘wartime measures’ and they made it sound like the federation was breathing down our necks. That xeno troops were gonna be busting down the doors at any hour!* 



*I had a little chuckle to myself, they ran us like slaves only for us to be slaves for other aliens. No projects got fully finished, the drones I designed were only functional by definition, nowhere near their full potential! I had very little hope for their combat effectiveness. Hell, every third drone had something different with it as I had to tweak them as the assembly line got rolling! Jones had personal interest in this project like my others but it didn't afford me any special treatment this time!* 



*From what I heard the comets were still struggling with getting their new engines to ignite and the Venlil refits weren’t even a quarter done! The only project that seemed to be completed before we got the evacuation order was project ‘hot moon’. Putting nukes on the goddamn moon...Clearly, nothing worked fully considering the death toll…having to be saved by a bunch of goddamn baby eaters…what a universe!*  



*It still didn’t make sense, last I knew these scaly demons were still just occupying our system! No reports of shots fired or those ‘cattle ships’ I kept hearing about, I wondered what their game was.* But before I could change the channel to the news there was a knock at the door.

“Who could that be?” I asked, struggling to get up but Yua shot me an angry look and thumped her tail “You sit! I’ll get it”. I grumbled but gave in. She's lucky that the painkillers were wearing off making this damn hole in my leg hurt so damn much when I put weight on it!



Didn’t stop me from craning my neck and trying to watch over her shoulder from the couch, whoever it was Yua seemed surprised which made me anxious. But she waved whoever it was in and to my surprise, it was one of those spiky Gojid fellows and he seemed a little skittish.

 

His little ears flicked as he slowly walked towards me, his body language seemed jumpy and timid, his eyes moving between the quill on the coffee table, my leg but he never looked at me properly. As soon as Yua got back to the kitchen there was another knock at the door, but I was more interested in the Gojid that walked past the dining table.



“h-hey” he introduced himself *kinda*, when he fully entered the living room “what can I help you with?” I asked, trying to keep a light welcoming tone. His business seemed to be with me and not Yua who was pushing in a box that was half her height. 



The Gojid moved his fingers causing his claws to click “I-I’m Gelid and…I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me yesterday” he just couldn’t seem to look at me properly, I had to remind myself that to non-doctor aliens, *I was a walking nightmare!*



I tried to help his fear by not facing him, hoping that’d comfort him a little. “ohhhh, good to see you're doing alright” I said but realizing how that had a bit of a negative tone. “i-in a good way, you were pretty scared” 

His tail swished across the floor, when Yua did it it meant she was happy but with how he clicked his claws louder I assumed it meant he was anxious. “I’m sorry for jabbing you with…that” he pointed to the quill. When I laughed he cowered and covered his face “Sorry, I’m not mad…I just found it funny since I was joking to Yua that you’d come knocking asking for it back” 



*Speak of the devil and she shall appear!* Yua pranced up to me and handed me a black, slightly reflective mask, it smelt fresh from the factory, reeking of synthetic materials. *Something that hurt my tree-hugging soul.* I gently took it from her paws confused as to its purpose. Yua seemed to have mixed feelings about it as her tail thumped as it swished.



“it’s supposed to make talking to *prey* a little easier” with how comfy Yua and the doctors seemed. It was easy to forget that we were still ‘predators’ to these people. Putting it on, it had a little extra bulk to it making it compatible with my glasses. Overall it was a little uncomfortable, the foam scratched at my skin a little and it made everything a little darker, limiting my peripherals. Facing the spikey fellow, he managed to stomach looking at my covered face “It…it helps…thank you” 



I sighed, hating how much I'd have to walk on eggshells around strangers now…but it was their planet and we’re…*I* am just living on it. “Why did you keep it?” our Gojid guest asked “Why not? Want it back?” he slunk back a little “Sebastion calls it his ‘battle trophy” Yua chimed in as she unpacked the rest of the box.



“no! No! By the protector no, I wouldn’t want to take anything meaningful like that from you” his spikes stood on end, poor guy looked one good scare from keeling over!



“Relax Gelid, us humans make jokes to break tension” I reassured him “Right…*he said something like that*” I heard him mutter, I wondered if I should ask about that “Are you doing alright?” I asked causing Geild to tense but then to relax “Yeah…it was pretty scary” I could tell he seemed deeply bothered about something, *was he supposed to be bonding with that human that attacked him?* 



I looked at Yua who was going over some luxury comfort food and booze from Earth that was in the box before looking back at the alien in front of me “You should stay for dinner Geild” My invitation caused him to tense up again. 



“*FOR* dinner Geild, we don’t eat people here…we *never* ate people” I reassured him, his head held low “R-right…b-but I shouldn’t, I should just go” “No, pull up a chair Geild, come try some this food from earth with us” I insisted, Yua looked she agreed as she flicked her ears.



“y-you’d really be okay with sharing?” he asked looking back at me “Of course! Push up that chair, sit for a bit” I said gesturing to the armchair that so far hasn’t been touched since we’ve moved in.



Not wanting to be rude or offend me more than he thought he already had, Geild gave in and pushed up the chair closer to the coffee table as Yua splayed out the goodies. Candy, honey, tea, cookies, cake mix, spices, wines, stronger spirits, *and…smokes?* My confusion was replaced with excitement as a big red tin clanged on the table “COFFEE!” I shouted, giddily grabbing the lid and pulling it off.



I ripped off my mask to take a deep whiff of the good stuff, it smelt so fresh, I offered the tin to the Gojid to smell, and he closed his eyes before gently taking the tin with shaky claws. Before I could pull my mask back down I saw another godsend added to the pile. 



“HONEY” I grabbed the jar, it was a whole two pounds of the stuff! In a glass jar no less! “Oh, it’s like Christmas! God, I feel like a kid again!” I needed some good news like this! After everything this meant the world to me! 



Yua seemed as excited as I was, her tail was wagging like nothing else, curving so much it kinda looked like a bow. Geild was looking like he was having his worldview shattered as I looked over everything “Feel free to try everything guys!” 



I told them as I opened the honey jar, getting some on my pinky and sucking off the gooey substance of the gods, Yua wanted to know what was so special about it and dipped a claw in it before also licking it off “I see why you like it so much!” Yua said, I extended my arm to Geild for him to try but he was looking shell-shocked. 



Fearing all my smiling and the fact I lost control of my volume caused this, I quickly pulled down my mask, but he didn’t move even after my face was hidden. “G-Geild?” I asked, he was breathing so that was a good sign but Yua seemed just as concerned as I was! I snapped my fingers in front of him “Geild, buddy, you're starting to scare me here” It took a few snaps but eventually he came back to life.



“I-it makes no sense” he muttered “Everything alright man?” I asked him softly bringing my hand back to myself “Y-Your a predator… you're *supposed* to be a predator…you fought off Sota…you two beat each other…the look in his eye” a tear started to roll down his fuzzy snout, I took a tissue and offered it to him, Yua was just observing for now.



Slowly he took the tissue between his claws and looked at it “You're not supposed to be this nice…” I kept all comments to myself and let the guy process it, knowing how it was when my world was shattered to a greater degree. “I saw that *hunger* in his eyes…in *your* eyes!” gently he dried his snout but the tears kept coming as he started to cry. “It just doesn't make sense” Yua approached him and rubbed his shoulder. 



I feared triggering something if I did the same but I still offered another tissue “I-I'm sorry” he whimpered but I could only feel bad, seeing a bit of myself in him. “No need to be sorry Geild, just deep breaths okay?” I cooed gently, his ear flicked as he tried to slow his breathing and gather himself. 



“It’s been an incredibly rough few days for us all,” I told him, Yua nodded whilst flicking her ears “Both of you lost so much, you both so strong” I looked confused and a little offended at Yua, *I just lost a billion of my people and could still be turned into a slave! Geild just got attacked,* ***not to compare trauma but I think mine is a little more drastic!***



“F-first the Cradle…then earth…now the Arxur” he whimpered. *The Cradle? The Arxur again!?!* Maybe I should've toughened up and watched the news sooner! Must’ve had the most confused look on my face as Yua’s tail stopped moving. “Sebastian has been a little out of the loop Gelid,” she said as an excuse for my pause in affirmations. 



That revelation seemed to give Geild something to think about as he looked at me and tilted his head a little “Y-you don’t even know about the attack on the Cradle? Nothing about the Arxur?” I gently shook my head.

“N-no, whilst I was on earth my job worked me to the bone, everyone at my work was cut off from everything not work-related, I only learned about the Arxur yesterday” Geild took a shuddering breath before explaining.



“Well, not long after what Captain Sovlin did to your Marcel got out, your forces attacked the defenses around our homeworld before doing a full invasion…it was chaos on the ground…I was a part of the defense force on the Cradle itself...*predators just fell from the skies!* *Nothing we could’ve prepared for! Nothing we thought possible!*”



“Once the shots were fired I crumpled and joined the stampede, but before I could get far I was knocked down by a predator soldier with the butt of his gun hitting my stomach” he shuttered and I couldn’t help but shed a tear, he was much braver than I, *not abandoning ship when his home was in need…but why does that name, Sovlin, sound familiar?*



“I was so afraid that I was gonna find my way on a cattle ship, I considered shooting myself with my sidearm before the predator got the chance me cattle! But it was already gone before I could…I was forced to stand once the battle was over. I joined what was left of my battalion and marched to a nearby camp, I thought those were gonna be my last moments, watching the skies for an incoming cattle ship to whisk us away to a living hell” he shuddered at the thought before looking at me and slowly reaching his claws towards my face.



I froze unsure what his play was, I didn’t want to swat the hand of a traumatized veteran and neither did Yua, she just stood still holding his other paw, I winced a little as I felt his sharp claws poke at my skin before lifting my mask up as he looked into my eyes.



“But we never were…our wounded were patched up, we were given food and tents, some pups were brought to the camps fencing so that families had a moment to see each other, even if it was for a moment…that's when was I realized that the federation must’ve gotten something wrong…you were predators, but not, n-not…***predators!*** Not a single prisoner was eaten! Not even the wounded or children!…that wasn’t…*that wasn’t right!”* 



I looked at him confused, *was rules of war a novel concept? I thought we were brutal!* “You were supposed to be worse than the Arxur!” He gently rubbed my face with his claws, studying it, looking into my eyes which were getting wet with tears. 



“B-but you were better than us!” a tear went down his snout as he took a shaky breath to continue “When we saw Arxur ships we thought we were done for! That you were in cahoots with the Grays! Giving us up so you could keep the planet!” his claws started to dig into my cheek as he grabbed it, but seeing the pain in his eyes, hearing how raw his emotions are in his voice, I didn’t have the heart to tell him, stop.



“But that's when the guns started to fire again! Bombers were striking the city on the other side of the hill and once your soldiers saw that they were bombing our homes that's when those keeping us imprisoned started to defend us! As primitive as your land army is, that didn’t stop you from using those pitt-, no…those brave cannons, firing at any approaching ships and scaring off the bombers if they got close to the camp!…we almost stampeded again but our commander shouted for our attention, the humans didn’t take his holopad away from him when he was captured”



He took a breath before continuing “he showed us video feeds of humans in orbit fighting off the Grays, which only confused us more but that's when he spoke, reading out loud a note as he projected the video on one of the tents…the note was from our leader Piri

Her bunker was bombed to oblivion but the video kept playing…with how much ferocity, how many humans covered escaping Gojid, it was way more effort than any cattle or land dispute called for…what made me realize that we were wrong, was seeing a pup crying over a human who was laying on the ground, dead, one human tried to consul and pull the pup away whilst another tried to recover the fallen comrade” 



I felt his hand squeeze harder “Before the video could finish we heard some shouts directed at us, our captors were waving for us to come towards where ships were landing…heh, we were so scared it took a warning shot to get us moving. We crammed in as tight as possible convinced that whatever you guys were planning for us, the Arxur were worse!” 



When he finished my face started to feel wet and it wasn’t just from the tears. When Gelid snapped out of it he let go of my face and I saw blood on the tip of his claws. “Oh, my protector! I-I'm so sorry!” “I'll get a bandage!” Yua said with urgency, running to the bathroom. 



I know the look in Gelid's eyes as he stared at the crimson creeping down his claws, I knew he felt like a monster. Wanting to comfort him I scooted a little closer and used a tissue to wipe his claws clean, the damage wasn’t serious and the emotional pain outweighed the physical pain, tenfold.



“Your okay Gelid” I assured him, gently holding the same claws that just drew my blood with compassion, not anger, and that only seemed to make him tear up more. He reached for another tissue and gently dapped up my blood as Yua returned with the whole medkit “Heh, at this rate, we’ll run out of tissues” I joked before I realized that Yua *brought the whole fucking medkit!* She looked angry at Gelid, her ears going down to her neck as she rubbed the fresh pock-marks with antiseptic “Yua, it was an accident!” I told her, she just thumped her tail in response.



“I-I should go,” Gelid said solemnly as he got up “No please, stay Gelid” I begged but Yua growled at me for suggesting that and it only made Geild sadder. As he started to slowly shuffle towards the door I called out “At least take something!” 



After I offered the goodies on the table, he slowly reached for a bag of gummy fruit before letting out what I think was a short laugh before pointing to the quill “A fair trade” he said and I smiled before covering my mouth not wanting to scare him but he didn’t seem bothered this time.



“thank you, guys,” he said as he continued shuffling to the door, just before he closed it I called out “Don’t be afraid to come back soon!” I just barely managed to see one of his ears flick before the door closed.



After Yua got the Bandaid on she sat back in a huff which annoyed me, where was the Venlil that cared for everyone who was hurting? “It was an accident, Yua!” I whined to her but her tail thumped again “he hurt you!” “he was hurting himself!” “*You're already hurt!* ***I ALMOST LOST YOU BECAUSE OF HIM!!!***” she screamed at me! “Geez! Calm down! Try something"" I tried to offer her a cookie but she smacked it out of my hand which made my hair stand on end. What *has gotten into her?*

“I'm not hungry!” she growled and stared at me as if it was my fault I was bleeding! “What did you want me to do Yua? Yell at the man!? He lost his homeworld too!” she growled louder and her tail thumping made the couch shake a little 



“So did you! He hurt you when you were trying to help him! It’s his fault you can't walk and fell down the stairs!” this new attitude was starting to piss me off! “For Christ's sake Yua! He didn’t fill my leg full of quills and push me down the stairs” “he might as well have!” 



I couldn’t stand her attitude anymore and got up, my anger overriding the pain. “If you're gonna be like this, then I'm gonna get ready for bed!” I hissed, I regretted saying that when I finished, but the words already came out. She just crossed her arms and kept thumping as I hobbled to our bedroom. 

*I was starting to not see the same Venlil that seemed to be checking on the human who kicked my ass and consulted the same Gojid she just scared out the door.*



**…**



It was a little awkward having to tape a plastic bag on my bad leg to keep my stitches dry but the part that hurt was getting over the threshold of where the door closed. I could hear Yua clean up the kitchen as I showered. I heard some clangs as she was in a pissy mood because I let someone pour their heart out! 



I felt bad for Gelid still, sure Yua had a point that it was his quill that almost made me bleed to death and it didn’t help me in doing down the stairs, but it’s not like he meant to do it! Not like he was gloating about it! I hoped by the time I was done she’d calm down and come to her senses. If not this was something we needed to talk about.

I *was* actually starting to have some love for Yua, she seemed loyal and caring but I didn't want her turning on every alien that made me the tiniest bit uncomfortable! 



I must’ve lost track of time as I noticed my fingers were starting to wrinkle. Just as I turned off the water I heard the door open and Yua poked her snout in “Seb? Are you alright?” In a panic, I covered my area with the washcloth! At least she sounded calmer now.



“Y-Yeah, just lost in thought is all” I explained as I got out of the shower, quickly wrapping the towel around my waist. “Can I come in?” “I only got a towel on, can it wait?” I told her, that as fast as things were going, I was not feeling ***that*** comfortable with her! “I’ll wait until you're out,” she said closing the door.



As I started to dry myself, she poked her snout in again causing me to cover my shame in fear! “don't forget to take your pill, just the big bottle for now” “Yes doctor Yua” I sighed before she closed the door again letting me get dressed. *maybe I should start locking the door!*  



Once my medicine and an extra painkiller were taken, PJ’s on, and my bad leg unbagged, I hobbled out, limping on my own as the texture of a wet crutch disgusted me more than my leg pained me. As soon as she registered that I was doing it all on my own, she growled and jumped up to help me along. “Yua, I know it’s because you care but please, I'm an adult for crying out loud!”



“You're hurt! I don't wanna hear it! The quicker you heal the better!” I just rolled my eyes. It still felt wrong climbing into bed with the sun still out…*and with a stranger no less!* But she closed the blinds and got into bed with me faster than I could say so. At least she wasn’t *that* mad at me but she didn’t face me.



“Is everything alright Yua?” I just had to ask, the last thing I wanted to do was to fall asleep angry. “You just let him hurt you like that…*do you just like getting hurt!?!*” her tail thumped once before curling around her leg and her ears went down but this time folded forward.



She started to cry softly, slowly I reached over with my good arm and gently petted her side, as crazy as she was acting, she still cared for me. “I don't have anyone else Seb…when I told my family that I was taking care of you, none of them replied, no one returned my calls…they blocked me and removed me from the family chat!”



I guess a few mysteries were starting to make sense. I gently pulled her closer and she gently put her head on my bad shoulder since it was the one facing her “You're the only reason I'm not homeless! Taking care of you has given me the drive to go back to medical school!” It broke my heart a little to hear that I was the *only* thing keeping her going. *even if she did just kinda admitted to be using me...*



“with you…it’s like I have a purpose again! No one ever got hurt on the ships I worked on, not outside paper cuts and stubbed claws! I never felt like a real doctor! Like I never had real responsibilities...*like I never mattered*” I gently pressed my lips to her head showing that I was here for her. 

“All my classmates got jobs at hospitals, but I was the lowest scoring in my class! So I got told to work elsewhere…they wouldn’t even let me be a pediatrician, Seb! *Do you know how demeaning that is?!? To feel like your medical license was a pity trophy?!?*” 



she sniffled more and I felt her tears hit my shoulder “To hear your family feel vindicated that you couldn’t live up to expectations?!?” I just took a deep sigh as it was her turn to pour her heart out. “You are the first person to thank me for helping them! I'm just a lonely D-class medical license holder, I'm just a tiny bit better than a petty nurse and everyone bhraking reminded me!” 



“You're the only person who made me feel like all my effort trying to be a doctor wasn't a waste! You're my only responsibility, not just as a doctor, but as a person! If something happened to you Seb, I’d really have nothing left for me…” 

She cried more and it was starting to hurt with how much weight she was putting right on the battered joint but the least I could do was tough it out for her as she had for me. 

“I thought that at best I could tag along and prove myself as someone useful…worse case was that you’d not want me…*or eat me”* I had to shift a little to put her head more on my bicep as it was getting too much to be on the swollen joint.



“s-sorry” she whimpered and rolled away but I stopped her from getting out of bed with a hand on the shoulder “Don't be Yua…please stay.” It must’ve been too much for her as she covered herself with the pillow and cried into it, I just laid there and let her cry it all out, *part of me was worried she’d try to smother herself.*



But thankfully she poked her head out eventually and swapped the position of her head and pillow to be the correct way. “I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner…I didn't want to make you feel bad for me when you were hurting so much already…” 



I wanted to put my arm under her but the inflamed joint wasn’t gonna allow that “Swap places with me” I told her and she climbed over as I shimmied under, and then I was able to put my good arm under her. Even this side of her pillow was a little damp with her tears but I didn't mind “Yua, a shared sorrow is only half a sorrow, shared joy is double joy...never feel like you have to bite your tongue with me.”



I felt like a fortune cookie but I just hoped she got what I meant and that I was repeating the quote correctly. She seemed to understand it and nuzzled right into my side, I felt her tail curling around my ankle and she whispered “Thank you Seb”. Just as I was starting to fall asleep I heard her let out a little whistle and mutter “Guess this whole building is full of crazies” good to see my sense of humor is spreading.

Hi, I’m Kat, I have 3 kiddos, almost 8, just turned 4 and 2.

We used to be a spanking house and recently stopped (you don’t need to tell me why I shouldn’t, we don’t anymore.) I read up on articles and what not, and we decided it wasn’t good for our family anymore.


Well my oldest went into school after getting angry with his father, (7 year old son has been stealing things and dad has been making him write lines and returning stolen objects) so he went into school and said he was being beat over everything and had lots of bruises.

Facts: He had been spanked in his life mostly when he was doing something dangerous or refusing to listen to all reason. He’s never had a bruise from an adult in his life. He was not being spanked daily, when we did spank. 

CWS was obviously called and came to our house.

They immediately said the child abuse claims were clearly false and almost decided to close, until they went into my kitchen.

I had a sink with dishes, some laundry laying next to the bin, and a coffee spill in the fridge… and they said my house was “unfit” and they’d send out another worker to follow up.  But as long as we cleaned up, then we would be closed out.

They also said the worker would be in touch to schedule a visit very soon. It’s been 5 days since then with no word.

So naturally I’m keeping everything pristinely clean, and busting my butt to do so with 3 kids all coming in to play and mess it up. 

The CWS worker even complained my kids had toys on their floor in their room. She was very uptight and rude to everyone. 

I’m so exhausted and have chronic illness, our house is never “dirty” but at times becomes cluttered. 

I needed to be more on top of things sure, but “unfit” is so wild and unnecessary.

None of the dishes were old or moldy, they were from breakfast and lunch that day. 

None of my house is dirty, smelly, or gross, just some cluttered and needs organization. 

Anyways, any moms here deal with CWS (CYS, CPS) this is my first and hopefully very last time, and I’m petrified. ",4,1729299135.0,breakingmom,1,0.83,False

On day one I skipped coffee and had matcha instead and I wasn’t as anxious that day. Last two days I had coffee and was kind of high strung. 

Doing tasks has been easier. Today I came home from work and was hungry and found myself just cooking up some rice and beans and I didn’t have to will myself to do it.
