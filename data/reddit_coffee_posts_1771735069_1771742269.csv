1rbeojg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1rbeojg/aita_for_being_angry_at_the_woman_my_boyfriend/,AITA for being angry at the woman my boyfriend dated while we were broken up?,"I (F20) and my boyfriend, ""E"" (M20), have been together for about three years, but we had a break in the middle. After two years of dating, we broke up due to some arguments. We stayed in ""zero contact"" for 5 months (I even saw someone else during that time).

We ended up getting back together after my mother was hospitalized; I was alone, desperate, and he was the only person I could think of to call and calm me down. Since then, our relationship has been great.

The problem started recently (7 months after getting back together).

There is a coffee shop my friends frequent where ""D"" (F23) works as a server. Recently, I went there and something surreal happened: I was in line, and when it was my turn, ""D"" looked at my face, simply walked away from the counter, and told her coworker: ""I am not serving her.""

I just stood there feeling humiliated while the line behind me grew and people stared at me without understanding anything.

When I told my boyfriend about it, he ""opened up."" He said that during the months we were apart, he went out with a few girls, and ""D"" was one of them. According to him, they only hung out in his group of friends and he drove her home once.

Here is where I might be the asshole:

I don’t consider myself a jealous person and I understand he was single, but I am very angry at her childish behavior. What bothers me the most is that, even after this public humiliation I faced at the coffee shop, my boyfriend still follows ""D"" on social media.

To me, it feels like a lack of respect for him to maintain a connection (even a virtual one) with someone who treated me poorly for no reason over something that happened while he was single. Am I the asshole for being angry and wanting him to unfollow her?",1,1771742247.0,AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,False

1rbekrp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rbekrp,The Fluidity of Honor: Reclaiming Moroccan Elegance.,"We’ve been taught that to look sharp, you have to be buttoned up, cinched in, and slightly uncomfortable. We think the Italian suit is the only blueprint for a refined man. So, we spend our lives in stiff collars and tight silhouettes, trying to fit a definition of class that wasn't built for our lifestyle or our values.

But there is a different kind of elegance. One that doesn't require you to sacrifice your comfort or your identity.

I’m talking about the Moroccan Thobe, specifically the Gandora and the Djellaba.

At Furqan, we don’t look at Moroccan craftsmanship as ethnic wear. We see it as the ultimate expression of Quiet Authority.

# The Architecture of the Sfifa

What makes the Moroccan style unique isn't just the cut; it’s the Sfifa-the intricate, handmade braiding that runs down the chest and sleeves.

In a landscape dominated by mass produced fast fashion, the Sfifa is a quiet, firm rejection of the disposable culture. It is a deliberate, handmade detail that calls for a slower, more intentional pace. When you wear a garment that carries that level of geometric precision, you aren’t just putting on clothes. You are carrying a lineage.

1. **The Fluid Silhouette:** Unlike the sharp, stiff lines of a Saudi Thobe, the Moroccan Gandora is about fluidity. It allows for movement. It provides a sense of Sakinah (tranquility) while maintaining a broad, commanding presence.
2. **The Qob (The Hood):** On a Djellaba, the hood is your mobile sanctuary. In the middle of a loud, chaotic street in Toronto or London, pulling up the Qob is a psychological reset. It’s a boundary. It tells the world: I am here, but I am centered.
3. **The Texture:** True Moroccan elegance relies on the hand of the fabric. We use heavy, woven materials that have a tactile richness. It feels like a physical manifestation of your convictions.

# The Restoration of the Self-Image

The External Crisis we face is the feeling that our tradition is too much for the modern world. We worry that a Moroccan silhouette is too loud for a coffee shop or a university campus.

But the reality is the opposite. People respect a man who is anchored.

When you step out in a Furqanwear Moroccan-style garment built with the weight and quality of a premium overcoat, the looks you get aren't out of judgment. They are out of curiosity. You are showing the world a version of masculinity that is dignified, calm, and unapologetic.

# The Furqan Guarantee: No Imports, No Gambles

The reason most brothers avoid the Moroccan style is the Import Gamble. You order a Djellaba from a random site, wait two months, and it arrives looking like a flimsy costume.

We ended that.

Furqan is a Toronto-based fulfillment hub. We hold our own stock right here in Canada. We oversee the quality control. When you decide to claim your Uniform of Honor, you receive a garment that meets the standards of a high-end boutique, delivered with the speed of a local brand.

Stop Blending In.

The world has enough men trying to look like everyone else. It’s starving for men who are rooted.

I like taking time to build characters, talk through ideas, and just hang out while we shape the story together, OOC is essential for me to build that connection.


Here are a few plot ideas to give you a sense of what I’m after:

SOL Ideas

Unexpected Roommates
Two strangers end up sharing a place because rent is ridiculous. They start off just trying to coexist, but shared routines and late‑night conversations slowly turn into something more.

The Coffee Shop Regular
He always orders the same thing. She’s the new barista who notices the little habits he doesn’t think anyone pays attention to. A quiet, everyday kind of romance built on small moments.

Fake Dating That Stops Being Fake
They agree to pretend to date for a family event, work situation, or some other social mess. It’s supposed to be temporary, but the line between acting and reality gets blurry.

Bridgerton‑Style Regency Romance

The Season’s Most Surprising Match
Set in a Bridgerton‑inspired world — ballrooms, gossip, pressure to marry well. He’s a reserved gentleman with a reputation for being hard to impress. She’s new to the season and not interested in playing by society’s expectations. One dance turns into a connection neither of them planned on.

Fantasy Romance Idea

The Mage and the Warrior
A disciplined warrior is assigned to protect a brilliant but stubborn mage whose research could change the fate of the kingdom. They clash at first, but danger forces them to rely on each other, and trust slowly turns into something deeper.

If any of these sound interesting — or if you’ve got ideas of your own — feel free to DM me. I’d love to build something together.

We were in agreement that he would come pick me up at 645p.m. And that he would have a chai latte waiting for me in the car. My husband had a class that started at 9 a.m. he decided to head to his class and take a nap until it started instead of going back home. Today was a slow day and I was able to keep in contact throughout the day through text with him. After class he went to the gym from 12-2p.m.  From then he was in a parking lot close to a shopping mall,(we share each others location) he said he was at the mall... (for 4+hours?) anyways I call him at 5:45p.m. And let him know I will be off exactly at 630p.m since it’s slow and report to the next shift will be quick. He said “sorry, on my way”. 600pm rolls around and he is still in the same location. I call and let him know I’ll be off at 630 and to not forget the latte, he replied with “ok, on my way”. 615 rolls around still no movement. He is 22 min away from my location. I call and he says “sorry, I forgot, I’ll be there soon”. I clock out at 633. I call to ask where he is. Same place. Said he’ll be here in 20 min. I wait, No movement on his part. I start walking home at 0638 (mind you home is 1:15hr walk home) we are trying to save money and uber/lyft was not in my book, I also get severe motion sickness in public transportation. He knows this and the fact that I hate waiting on people when I’m getting picked up. It gives me anxiety. I call to let him know I’m walking home and to call me whenever he gets close.  finally he is on his way. I continue walking. at the 15 min mark I check to see how close he is. I am floored. He decided to go through the streets instead of the freeway. Freeway was a 22 minute drive. His route of choice was a 35 min drive. It’s 720ish, I’m half way home by the time he gets to the hospital asking where I am. i tell him where I’m at and he does not believe I walked that far in 20 min. Sir it’s been close to 40 min. He starts to drive my way. From the hospital to home is a 12-15 min drive depending on traffic. Why did he stop at a random spot not Close to where I told him. I continue Walking. I make it to the bridge before he finally calls to ask where I am at. I’m 20-25 min from home at this point. I only had a light sweater and it was cold. It took him 26 min to get to my location From when he left the hospital. I get in the car and he starts driving back downtown. hes taking me to get the latte he never got me. I tell him I no longer want it. Late actions are cheaper than grass. Twice I say no to coffee. We arrive to the cafe. The drive there I ask why it took him 50 min to pick me up. something with his glasses. I asked why he couldn’t communicate and let me know what was holding him up. Responded with it was only 20 min And that I’m usually out at 7. I clarified that I called 3 times to let him know I’ll be out early. Defensive responses is all I got. Anyways his ex coworker and current classmate calls and they chat while I’m feeling abandoned and invalidated and just plain felt unimportant. Did I over react by leaving the car and walking away from him? He didn’t bother to chase me and apologize. Instead asked why I started to cause a scene while he was on the phone. I was crying. I was angry. I walk another 35 min. I get to Harmon’s im freezing. I’m there 40 min before he finally reaches me. I finally get home at 924p.m. I try to bring up how today hurt my feelings. No good. I get to my room and he is taking out coins from our jar. Tells me he is going to play pool Says let’s go. I have not showered, I’m tired, slept 3 hrs the night before, no dinner. I take the car keys to go get something to eat and he mutters “really you won’t let me go play pool, you won’t let me do anything on my day off”. I come home and he leaves without word at 1015p.m. while I am in the shower. I am so numb but I want to scream, cry, shout. he said hed be out for 1.5 hrs.

Every Monday, I'd vow to meditate daily, exercise, or read, only to have my motivation evaporate by Wednesday. My calendar was full of planned habits, but my actual habit tracker was a graveyard of broken streaks and frustrated promises to myself. It felt like I was constantly battling my own brain.

I bought ""Atomic Habits,"" tried the Pomodoro Technique, even attempted the ""Don't Break the Chain"" method – all recommended, all failed for me within days or weeks. I thought I lacked discipline, that *I* was the problem. Then, after yet another failed attempt to wake up at 5 AM for a morning routine, I almost gave up. It hit me: *my energy levels weren't a constant resource to be exploited, but a fluctuating one to be managed.* I realized the real problem wasn't my willpower, it was that I was trying to force habits into times when my energy was naturally at its lowest, setting myself up for failure before I even started.

After failing countless times, I started observing myself like a scientist. I developed what I call the **Energy-Aligned Habit Flow**. It's about syncing your desired habits with your natural energy peaks, rather than fighting against your body's rhythm.

Here's how I did it:

**Step 1: The Energy Audit (1 week)**
*   **What:** For a full week, track your energy levels every 2-3 hours. Use a simple 1-5 scale (1=drained, 5=peak focus/energy). Note down what you're doing, eating, and how you feel. I used a simple note in my phone, just a number and a quick observation.
*   **Example:** ""9 AM (4): Focused, good coffee. 1 PM (2): Post-lunch slump, hard to concentrate. 6 PM (5): Second wind, creative ideas flowing.""
*   *This helps you identify your personal ""energy map"" – when you're naturally wired for focus, movement, social interaction, or rest.*

**Step 2: Habit-Energy Matching**
*   **What:** List your desired habits and assign them an ""energy type.""
    *   **High Energy/Focus:** Deep work, intense exercise, learning complex topics.
    *   **Medium Energy/Routine:** Emails, light exercise, meal prep, tidying up.
    *   **Low Energy/Restorative:** Meditation, reading, journaling, gentle stretching.
*   **Example:** My ""learn coding"" habit needs High Energy. ""Workout"" needs Medium-High. ""Journaling"" needs Low Energy.
*   Then, slot these habits into your energy map. If my audit showed me I'm a zombie at 7 AM but sharp at 10 AM, I stopped trying to do deep work first thing and moved it.

**Step 3: Micro-Habit Anchors**
*   **What:** Start incredibly small. Don't aim for a 30-minute workout if your energy audit says you barely have 15 minutes of medium energy available for it. Link new habits to existing ones, but now, considering energy.
*   **Example:** Instead of ""morning workout,"" I changed it to ""after coffee, 5 push-ups"" (Medium Energy after a caffeine boost). My ""read for 30 minutes"" became ""before bed, read 1 page"" (Low Energy, easy win).
*   *The goal is a consistent win, not a heroic effort.*

**Step 4: The Energy Recharge Protocol**
*   **What:** Integrate intentional energy recovery throughout your day. This isn't just about sleep. It's short breaks, mindful eating, hydration, or a 5-minute walk.
*   **Example:** If I know I have a 1 PM slump (Step 1), I'd schedule a 15-minute power nap or a walk outside *before* that slump usually hit. This allowed me to have more consistent medium-energy blocks later.
*   *The part nobody talks about is that consistency isn't just about doing, but also about strategically recharging so you CAN keep doing.*

Here's what I wish someone told me before I started: this isn't magic, and your energy isn't static. Stress, bad sleep, or a busy day will throw off your energy map. I almost gave up when I had a particularly stressful week, and my carefully crafted schedule crumbled. It felt like I was back to square one. This won't work if you try to force the exact same schedule every single day or if you ignore your body's real signals. Be warned: it took me a solid 10 weeks to really feel the rhythm and see lasting change. You'll need to re-evaluate your energy audit regularly, especially during life changes. Common mistake: pushing through low-energy periods thinking you're being ""disciplined"" when you're actually burning out.

After implementing the **Energy-Aligned Habit Flow** for 10 weeks, the changes were significant. I went from inconsistent attempts to achieving a 90% consistency rate on my core habits. I consistently woke up at 6 AM (a time I previously dreaded) because I'd moved my deep work to my mid-morning energy peak and allowed for low-energy journaling at dawn. I successfully meditated 5-7 times a week (up from 1-2), finished 3 books, and consistently hit my daily step count, not by *forcing* myself, but by strategically placing these activities when my body and mind were most receptive. My frustration with myself plummeted, replaced by a quiet confidence.

1rbeayc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1rbeayc/just_discovered_that_i_have_no_game/,Just discovered that I have no game,"I’m 22F, in college. I don’t know how to have a conversation with someone I’m interested in romantically. I was pretty socially awkward in middle and highschool, and I’ve always struggled to make friends. So making myself likable to new people I meet is a skill that I’ve been and am continuing to try and improve. A piece of advice that has stuck with me very well is to let people talk about themselves and be genuinely interested in what they are saying. I think I am pretty good at this. And it’s not fake either, I’m genuinely interested. I love talking to strangers and learning about their lives. But I won’t lie and pretend it’s not at least a little bit of facade. I am interested but I’m also trying my best to be likeable, and do a good job at having a conversation. It’s like a challenge, and me walking away knowing that the other person felt good about themselves and like they had an engaging conversation means I did a job well done. 

This is great for my job in retail, introductions to classmates and professors, talking to distant relatives, friends of my parents, uber drivers, waiters, etc. It’s great for making people feel comfortable around me and have a good impression of me, and it breaks the ice for future interactions. But it’s not so great for meeting a guy at a bar or wherever who you’re not likely to ever see again. I feel like whenever I meet a guy at a bar I just end up interrogating him and he loses interest. I don’t know how to flirt. At least not with strangers. I think im a flirtatious person. I think I flirt with friends tbh. I love banter. I don’t know how to do that with a stranger though. 

The next paragraph is the story sparking my request for advice. I ramble a lot so it’s kind of long sorry. You probably don’t need to read it unless you want more specific details. I’m really just asking for advice on how to flirt with a guy I meet at a bar so if you got general tips you don’t have to continue reading unless you want the full spiel. :)

Last night, I was talking to this very attractive man. I’d seen him at a coffee shop earlier that day and I remember making eye contact with him several times but I never said anything bc I’m shy with crushes. Then he left and I regretted it not saying anything. I ended up going to the bar that night with my friends, very impromptu, and guess who I saw? The man the myth the legend himself. Liquid courage and my friend enabled me to go up to him. I told him about how I’d seen him earlier and I thought he was British because of his outfit and we recognized him because of it and he had a cool motorcycle etc etc. He was interested in the convo, I think we chatted for a bit, but then he went for his turn with his friends at karaoke. After their song, I was chatting with my friend and he came down from the stage did a slight of hand magic trick to pull his cigarette from behind my ear, and then went outside to the porch. This girl I met that night lowkey forcefully shoved me after him which I was actually pretty embarrassed by but he didn’t mind and we talked outside for a bit. But it was like that interrogation thing. I mentioned not getting a lot of work done at the coffee shop and he asked if it was his fault clearly trying to flirt and I was like omg no I just couldn’t focus tho fr but partially cause of you yeah. He brought my friends who had also come outside into the conversation and his friends who was smoking with him and we all chatted together. Then he was called back inside to sing another song and it seemed like he hadn’t realized he was up cause him and his friend hurriedly stubbed their cigarettes out and sped inside.  I followed my friends back inside and hung out and danced with them, and when he finished with his friends he came down and was kinda standing right next to me but it was more like our two groups of people standing next to each other. I didn’t really want to initiate conversation again bc I felt like I’d made it pretty clear I was interested and I didn’t want to push if he didn’t feel the same, but I also felt awkward because he was standing right next to me and I didn’t know if I should’ve said something so I think I pretended I didn’t see him and talked to my friend… I don’t remember how we ended up talking again but he said him and his friends were going to a different bar and he had me give him my phone and he put his number in it. I texted him immediately and let him know so he’d have my number bc I didnt want to have to be the one to reach out bc I was still confused if he was interested. And then he left. I saw him a few hours later when we walked past each other on the sidewalk, I pretended not to see him because I didn’t want to seem clingy or obsessive or something, and he still hadn’t texted me back I don’t think at that point. Later that night he texted me again hello in response to my hello and I just said omg hi bc I was surprised he actually texted back. Then like an hour later before I went to bed I texted him to not forget he promised me a motorcycle ride. I figured that way I left him something to work with the next day if he was actually interested. 

He never responded. It’s only been a day, and I honestly don’t care that much I’ve gone through my fair share of rejections so I’m not really that phased by it, but I was confused. Because he was interested in me right? He wouldn’t have given me his phone number or done a magic trick to me if he wasn’t attracted to me, right? So it’s left me thinking, it’s not my physical appearance that’s the problem anymore. So it must be….me? And I reflected on the conversation and I’ve realized had the hook but Idk how to fish. I fumbled a very fine man bc I talked to him like he was a customers in my shop. Totally fumbled. Please give me some advice. I’m not used to guys flirting with me because I’ve only recently leveled up my physical appearance and apparently I’m not good at this yet. ",4,1771740964.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

1rbe95y,https://www.reddit.com/r/directorymakers/comments/1rbe95y/built_a_regional_directory_unexpectedly/,Built a Regional Directory (Unexpectedly),"While on hiatus sa work, I did some readings and research on lead generations, AI, data scraping, current tech tools, etc. While cleaning and enriching data ng local leads across multiple industries, I realized this would be helpful if compiled into an easy to use website/app.

https://preview.redd.it/c8xsd8g4nzkg1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd798f4a94a58b330f53fbcb4664a76b512778b1

This was based on personal experience that if I need anything - local services, good  resturants with a view, work-friendly cafes, government office, etc - i would always search online, either facebook, google, or blogs which works however all links and information are all scattered making it inefficient.

So why not build something kung where users like me can easily find curated local establishments. So I tried building one, initially, for myself, but hopefully for others who also has the same pain points.

**Core Features**

* listings with essential information
* search and filter by keyword, location (municipality), and category
* listing organization by category
* enhanced and featured listings
* google map integration
* individual listing CTAs
* local guides/blog
* analytics
* built using wordpress - a month for the design & development and data scraping & enrichment.

**Features Excluded to keep it simple and due to limited server resources, since I am a one-man team and considers this just a side project.**

* user account creation for business claiming and user reviews
* ratings / review
* listings near me - not sure pa how this works for browser based website/web apps

**Learnings**

* planning matters. build would have been faster and much more organized if well planned from the start. my process for this was build as you go - though it made it flexible so I can just build the essentials.
* choose the stack you're most comfortable with. I think this could have been easily built by vibe coding but since that is not my forte, i opt with a process and tech stack i am familiar with.
* take advantage of tools and all available help. used chatgpt, apify, and wordpress.

Started as a side project to solve my own problem. Hopefully, it would be useful to the local community to make it easier for people to discover and access establishments.

I've been single for almost 10 years, I've used dating apps in the past however never really found anything long term. I am almost the complete opposite of everyone in the sense of I don't use social media, I don't even use a smart phone. I use a ""dumb phone"" that I can call and text on as I hate how addicting phones have become and feel like my overall happiness has improve significantly due to this and I feel like I have so much time on my hands. I don't drink alcohol either. I love to exercise, I'm fit, own my own apartment, love the outdoors, have a good job and am overall financially stable. I feel like I'm in a great place in all other aspects of my life but dating I feel so far behind. My friends and alot of people around me are starting to have kids so I feel really far behind, not that I want kids right away however I would want them within the next 4-5 years and I'd want to be with someone for atleast 2-3 years before having kids. My social circle is quite small, I have probably 4-5 close friends who I hang out with consistently and I spend alot of time with family too as we are all super close. 

  
I am so unsure on how to meet people, I feel like everyone's attention spans are so short when it comes to dating and no one wants to make any effort. I have tried organising dinners, coffee catchups and I feel like no one will ever commit or are very happy to cancel last minute, and when that happens it makes me completely uninterested in meeting them again or pursuing them. 

  
All I want is someone who is emotionally intelligent, actually looking for something meaningful and wanting to put effort in and someone who I'm attracted to. Literally the absoulte bare minimum when looking for a partner but I cannot find it. I'm not sure if the no smart phone or the no drinking is a red flag, however I feel like I'd rather wait and meet the right person and hopefully they don't mind. I just have no idea how to actually meet people to date in the real world. I'm not meeting anyone through friends, through work and I don't want to be the creep trying to chat up girls working out at the gym.

# 🛑 The Problem: Why ""Big Apps"" are Failing Durban

Let’s be honest—Durban dating in 2026 has become a minefield. Between the ""Tinder Swindlers,"" the endless bots, and profiles that haven't been active since 2022, finding a real person between uMhlanga and Amanzimtoti feels like a full-time job.

Most global apps don't care about our local safety concerns, and they definitely don't understand the ""Durban vibe.""

# ✅ The Solution: A Community Built for the 031

We created this subreddit and the **Destiny Durban** platform to give locals a **free Durban dating** experience that actually works. Our goal is simple: **Quality over Quantity.**

We focus on:

* **Real People:** No international scammers or ""traveling"" bots.
* **Safety First:** Local moderation and verification.
* **Intentionality:** We want people who actually want to meet up at Florida Road or the Promenade, not just collect matches.

# 🚀 Join the Verified Community: Destiny Durban

If you’re tired of the games and want to browse verified, local profiles, join us at the official site.

**How it works:**

* **For Women:** Access is **100% Free**. We prioritize a safe, curated environment for you to browse without the spam.
* **For Men:** A nominal fee of **R30 per month**.
   * *Why the fee?* It costs less than a cappuccino at Granville's, but it acts as a ""quality filter."" It ensures that every man on the platform is a real person invested in finding a genuine connection, not a bot or a fly-by-night scammer.

# 🛡️ Quick Safety Tips for 2026

Before you post here or meet anyone, remember the Durban Gold Rules:

1. **Public is Best:** Stick to high-traffic areas like Suncoast, Gateway, or the Village.
2. **Verify via Voice:** Always ask for a quick voice note or video call before the first date.
3. **Trust Your Gut:** If a profile looks too good to be true, it probably is.",1,1771740118.0,DurbanDating,0,1.0,False

He nodded ""Sure"" she sat down, taking a brief look at him. He was tall and lean, with messy dark hair and a wrinkled shirt. There was a sketchbook on the table next to his coffee. His eyes were a deep brown, like rich cocoa. Nanditha took out a notebook from her olive green messenger bag. She had dark eye bags and a slightly smudged red lipstick, unstyled hair that hung down free and wild, and ink stains on her fingers. She started looking around the cafe, taking in everything. Kiran watched her from across the table. Her wild hair, the smudged lipstick, the ink-stained fingers—she looked like a creative mess. He found himself smiling. ""You a writer?"" He look a sip of his coffee. She nodded and smiled. ""And you?"" ""Painter and sculptor"" he replied.

Nanditha took out her ink bottle and filled her pen. ""So you here to paint or just having a Sunday coffee?"" She pointed at the sketchbook with her eyes. ""Both, actually,"" Kiran answered with a small shrug and smile. ""I fell in love with the way the mist behaves here... Wanted to paint the cafe's yard..."" He stopped and took a sip of his coffee ""... But coffee first!"" Nanditha chuckled. ""Coffee is artist fuel"" she said. He nodded in agreement and leaned back in his chair. ""You said you fell in love with this place... Are you not from around here?"" Nanditha asked. The waiter came to take her order. She ordered a coffee. ""No... I'm travelling... I've covered almost all South Indian states now... Hunting for sceneries... Every new place is a new adventure. I want to travel on larger scales... Outside of India..."" He explained. She nodded along. There was a glimmer in his eyes when he talked about it. The volume of his voice increased a bit and he threw his hands up excitedly. ""It's like even the wind behaves differently in each place. The earth is a different color, the people decorate it differently... You get addicted to that kinda stuff"" Nanditha hummed. ""So where's next?"" She asked. ""I'm leaving for Kanyakumari in a while. Got a train at 7"" Kiran replied. The wind was carding through the wind chimes. Maybe it does behave differently in different places.

She was absentmindedly tapping her fountain pen on her notebook all this time while talking, she only noticed then that she was leaving ink splotches all over the page. But she didn't mind. She looked around the cafe and tried to scribble something down. She then started striking out things and editing, the page turning into a beautiful mess that only she could navigate around. Kiran watched it with enthusiasm. Her coffee arrived. She took a sip. ""I like when people drinking coffee become a vehicle of it... It's like they become coffee... Don't know how to explain it but... it's poetic when it happens"" She said as she put down the cup and looked around at the people in the cafe. ""You're quite the observer"" he remarked with a tilted head and a soft smile. ""Yeah well that's why I'm a writer, you see?"" She chuckled. She had smile lines around her eyes that squinted when she smiled.

After a few minutes, she had striked out more and more lines until everything she wrote was striked out. She let out a sigh. Kiran nodded understandingly. Being an artist, he knew that feeling all too well. ""My dad once gave me a piece of advice... He said,"" he put on an impression of his father, ""don't move the brush! Let the brush... Move you"" Nanditha chuckled. She took a breath and looked at the messy page in front of her. Then she looked up, at the coffee cup in Kiran's hand. The subtle little paint stains on his fingers... The tenderness of the way they wrap around the cup in a gentle hug... The beads of moisture on the cup that drip onto his fingers and touch the paint stains... He felt slightly self-conscious for a moment, but the thoughtful and deep gaze in her eyes made him not mind it. Her attention felt almost reverent, like she's studying something deeply meaningful instead of just his stained hands holding a cup.

Then she opened a new page and started writing. One line at a time. Slow... She drank her coffee in between. Kiran tried to catch glimpses of the lines on the page, but her handwriting was too illegible from that angle. He found himself admiring the way the pen moves with purpose, the way her eyebrows curl slightly as she concentrates... He opened his sketchbook and started outlining her with a charcoal pencil. Admiring her with each line, lost in every little nuance of her messy little artist self. His pencil moved fluidly and his hand moved with it. She didn't seem to mind. ""Are you from here? The sunlight seems to really like you..."" He asked without looking up from the sketching. ""No, I came to attend the literature festival"" ""Ah yes, I went there yesterday"" Kiran said. ""What? When?"" ""Like, 3-4pm?"" ""I was there at 3pm! We were there at the same time!"" They both laughed. ""That is crazy"" Kiran said as he finished up his drawing. Nanditha finished writing and did some quick editing.

Kiran leaned back in his chair and stretched. She looked at the sketchbook ""can I see?"" Kiran nodded and turned the book around to show her. His cheeks were slightly flushed from the intense concentration. The sketch was stunning—it captured every aspect of her perfectly. He watched her eyes as they widened looking at it. ""It's... Beautiful!"" She said with a big smile. ""You made me look like... Like how I hoped someone would see me. In all my rawness and all my radiance... Your hands are blessed."" Kiran felt a surge of pride. ""Thank you,"" he whispered with a grateful smile. ""You're..."" He started. She looked up from the drawing. ""You're incredibly interesting to draw"" he admitted as his eyes flicking all over her face, studying the way the subtle blush that's blooming on her cheeks suited her cheekbones. ""The way you hold your pen, the way your hair falls... It's like you're made to be sketched."" He found himself leaning forward slightly. Naditha smiled. ""Well... Maybe artists have a secret connection to each other""

""Maybe they do"" he agreed softly. ""What did you write?"" he asked curiously, nodding towards the notebook. Nanditha took a breath and shifted in her seat, then started reading.
""Sunday coffee, touched by the sun
The more the caffein, the better the art
The cup is to be hugged, not clutched like a purse
Way too few know this
The artist does it right
Stains of paint on his fingers 
Resurrected by the drops of water slithering down the cup
He's tender with the touch
The droplet slithers inside and nestles
Cozy under his finger
There's enough space for that
For he's not clutching, he's hugging
The sunlight is kissing the coffee
The mist that loves his arm hair
And I think I want someone to hold me like that
To cup my face with tenderness enough to
Let my teardrops have a soft space to tuck in
To tell me ""unclench your jaws, I want to kiss you""""
Kiran listened, completely captivated. When she finished, he stayed silent for a moment. The tenderness in the poem made his heart ache in a sweet way. ""What do you think?"" She handed him the notebook. He read it over one more time. ""It's... beautiful!"" He said with a bright smile. ""The way you made the simple act of holding a cup of coffee into something this... Tender... It's magnificent"" He paused, then added softly, ""...And I think someone should hold you like that."" Nanditha looked down with a smile. ""I think you should find someone who'd draw you the way you drew me..."" She whispered.

Kiran slowly reached out and took her hand, his charcoal-stained fingers intertwining with her ink-stained ones. ""Maybe I already have,"" he said quietly, looking into her eyes. ""Maybe my mad journeys could end in this misty place... Maybe I should practice my portrait skills better instead of landscapes..."" Nanditha shook her head ""I don't paint..."" ""You just painted the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"" he pressed her hand gently. ""With words. You captured something I didn't even know I was showing. If that's not painting, what is?"" She blushed. ""Have your travels been in search of a woman then?"" She looked up. ""No... Like I said, my goal was to fill my sketchbook with sceneries from different places. Every painting has a story. About the people I met there, the culture I learned about, the interesting stories and life lessons..."" She nodded along. That same glimmer was in his eyes again when he talked about travelling. ""I'll give you something to keep..."" Nanditha held her messy hair back and leaned down to press her lips on the lips of the drawing. Her lipstick print stood out as she made the black drawing wear a statement lipstick. The charcoal stained her red lip but she didn't care.

Kiran watched with bated breath. It felt so unexpectedly intimate, so deeply romantic in its simplicity, that he felt as if he was kissed. He gently took the sketchbook back. ""What can I have?"" She asked with a tilted head. He opened her notebook and signed his usual artist's sign with the charcoal pencil as the title of the poem. He handed it back to her. He looked at his watch. ""I have a train to catch... I have to get to the station in time"" He reluctantly murmured. She nodded. ""Safe travels"" he pressed his lips and smiled as he stood up. ""Um... Take care..."" He said. ""You too..."" She smiled. He slowly walked away, as if being ripped and pulled away against his will. A guitarist was singing a song a few tables behind her. ""I hear your ship is docked... And it's time for you to go... And you don't look back at all... No, not at all... I must watch you go... And you'll never know... You'll never know...""

Kiran arrived at the railway station before time. He waited for the train, pacing around. But he wasn't waiting for the train. He was waiting for a glimpse of a messy wild hair running after him, telling him to not go. He kept searching among the crowd. It was a foolish hope but he had to hold onto it.

In the café, Nanditha let out sigh after sigh as she held the cup of half-drunk coffee he left behind. The warmth that lingered... The charcoal stains... The clutched it tightly. The guitarist continued his song. ""Oh Odysseus... Your ship is in the deck and this is it... The ocean calls me to dive in, my heart is collapsing, and you'll never know... You'll never know..."" She was imagining him running back in. Any second now... He might just come back saying he cancelled the train. Her eyes desperately looked for him in every man that walked into the café.

The train was on time. Kiran looked. Any second now... But no. He sighed and stepped inside the train. About the same time, Naditha walked out of the café.",2,1771739977.0,u_Razmik_raz,0,1.0,False

[**Learn English Through Roleplay AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) transforms language acquisition into an adventure. Instead of memorizing vocabulary lists or drilling grammar rules in isolation, you learn English by living it—navigating conversations with characters, making choices that matter, and absorbing language through emotionally engaging stories.

✅ Immersive storytelling that makes vocabulary stick  
  
✅ Real-time pronunciation guidance with text-to-speech  
  
✅ Adaptive difficulty from beginner to advanced  
  
✅ Grammar learned through context, not worksheets

Traditional language learning often fails because it treats English as an abstract system to be studied rather than a living tool to be used. This AI flips that approach entirely, grounding every lesson in narrative experiences that your brain is wired to remember.

# Quick Answer: What Is Learn English Through Roleplay AI?

[**Learn English Through Roleplay AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) **is an AI-powered language learning tool that teaches English through interactive storytelling, where you navigate scenarios as a character while naturally acquiring vocabulary, grammar, and cultural understanding.**

**Key capabilities:**

* Adapts to your proficiency level (A1 beginner through C2 advanced)
* Provides instant pronunciation guides and text-to-speech for new vocabulary
* Creates personalized scenarios based on your interests
* Teaches phrasal verbs, idioms, and collocations in memorable contexts

# Why Traditional English Learning Falls Short

Learning a language is fundamentally different from learning facts. Yet most English courses treat vocabulary and grammar as information to be memorized, tested, and forgotten.

>

The problems with conventional approaches run deep:

# 📚 Decontextualized Vocabulary

Memorizing word lists produces recognition without fluency. You might recognize ""call off"" on a test but freeze when someone uses it in conversation. Research published in *System* journal found that [positive emotional stimuli significantly enhance vocabulary retention](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X21002323), yet most learning materials strip away emotional context entirely.

# 🎯 Grammar Without Purpose

Learning that ""present perfect continuous describes an action that started in the past and continues to the present"" is abstract. Hearing a character say *""I've been meaning to bring this up""* while nervously approaching you about a difficult topic—that's memorable. The grammar pattern anchors to an emotional moment.

# 😰 Speaking Anxiety

The fear of making mistakes in front of others is one of the [greatest barriers to language acquisition](https://www.immerse.com/blog/why-immerse-works). Studies from Chuo University found that **98.8% of learners reported reduced foreign language anxiety** when learning through immersive environments with avatar-based interactions.

# 🔄 Passive Consumption

Watching videos and reading textbooks keeps you in reception mode. But language is a production skill—you need to use it. Role-playing activities have been shown to [develop learners' speaking competence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370505017_The_Importance_of_Role-Playing_Activities_in_Developing_Students'_Speaking_Competence) by creating authentic communicative experiences that improve fluency and confidence.

# How Roleplay Transforms Language Learning

[Learn English Through Roleplay AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) leverages what neuroscience tells us about how the brain actually acquires language.

|Traditional Approach|Learn English Through Roleplay AI|
|:-|:-|
|Memorize vocabulary lists|Encounter words in meaningful contexts|
|Study grammar rules abstractly|Absorb patterns through natural dialogue|
|Practice with textbook exercises|Navigate real conversational scenarios|
|Fear of making mistakes|Safe space to experiment and learn|
|One-size-fits-all difficulty|Adaptive scaffolding for your level|

# The Science of Story-Based Learning

Research in cognitive neuroscience reveals that [narrative speaks the mother tongue of the brain](https://www.mindbrained.org/2021/12/neuroscience-shows-us-drama-is-an-effective-language-teaching-tool/). Almost everything the brain experiences—from body states to verbal exchanges—is processed through cause and effect. Stories align with this fundamental operating procedure.

>

When you learn the phrase ""break the ice"" while your character nervously approaches a stranger at a party, the emotional context creates multiple memory anchors. The vocabulary isn't just information—it's experience.

# Embodied Cognition in Language Learning

The brain doesn't stop at your spine. It extends throughout your entire body via the nervous system, and this has profound implications for learning. Studies on [language learning through role-playing games](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5332359/) demonstrate that immersive interaction strengthens neural pathways associated with language processing.

When you imagine yourself as a character—making decisions, feeling emotions, navigating social situations—your brain processes the language more deeply than when you're simply observing from the outside.

https://preview.redd.it/4og2tlvljzkg1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb445f07bb0d24993c17ab412d906c57fd04f2b

# How Learn English Through Roleplay AI Works

The system operates in two complementary modes that work together to accelerate your English acquisition.

**Step 1: Assessment & Setup**

When you first start, [the AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) assesses your current English level through natural conversation. It asks about your learning background, what English media you consume, and gauges your comprehension through simple exchanges. This determines whether you start at A1 (beginner), B1 (intermediate), or C1 (advanced).

**Step 2: Scenario Design**

You choose the world you want to explore. Options include:

* Modern America (coffee shops, workplaces, social gatherings)
* Fantasy adventures (quests, magical encounters, epic narratives)
* Professional settings (job interviews, business negotiations)
* Travel scenarios (airports, hotels, local interactions)
* Romantic storylines (dating, relationships, emotional conversations)

**Step 3: Immersive Roleplay**

The AI creates a rich narrative where you're the main character. NPCs (non-player characters) speak in English, with scaffolding appropriate to your level:

>

For beginners, every dialogue line includes text-to-speech pronunciation, phonetic guides, and translations. As you advance, scaffolding gradually decreases until you're engaging with natural English.

**Step 4: Natural Error Correction**

When you attempt English (correctly or incorrectly), NPCs respond naturally. If your meaning is clear, they continue the conversation. If something's confusing, they ask for clarification in-character: *""Sorry, what was that?""* or *""Wait, you mean...?""*

This mirrors how language correction happens in real life—through communication breakdown and repair, not red ink on a page.

**Step 5: Grammar & Vocabulary Reinforcement**

Every roleplay session ends with Language Notes that explain the grammar patterns and vocabulary you encountered:

>

# What You'll Master

# 📖 Vocabulary That Sticks

Instead of memorizing word lists, you encounter vocabulary in contexts that make it memorable. The AI tracks which words you've seen and gradually reduces scaffolding as words become familiar:

|Exposure Level|Treatment|
|:-|:-|
|New (1-2 times)|Full pronunciation guide + translation|
|Reviewing (3-4 times)|Translation only|
|Familiar (5-7 times)|English only|
|Graduated (8+ times)|No scaffolding needed|

# 🗣️ Phrasal Verbs & Idioms

One of the hardest aspects of English for virtually all learners. [This AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) introduces phrasal verbs through NPC dialogue where context makes meaning clear:

* *""I've been trying to get ahold of you all day""*
* *""Let's call it off and try again tomorrow""*
* *""Something came up—I can't make it tonight""*

# 🎭 Register Awareness

English changes dramatically based on context. The same person might say:

* **Formal (to a boss):** ""Would you be able to review this when you have a moment?""
* **Standard (to a stranger):** ""Could you help me with something?""
* **Casual (to a friend):** ""Hey, can you check this out real quick?""

NPCs model appropriate register naturally, and you develop intuition for when to use each.

# 🎵 Connected Speech & Pronunciation

Natural English doesn't sound like textbook English. Speakers use contractions (*I'm, you're, they've*), reductions (*going to → gonna, want to → wanna*), and linking (*""an apple"" sounds like ""uh-NAPPLE""*).

The AI models these patterns in NPC dialogue and provides explicit pronunciation coaching when needed.

# Real-World Applications

# 💼 Professional English

Navigate job interviews, business meetings, and workplace conversations. Learn the vocabulary and register appropriate for professional contexts while building confidence through low-stakes practice.

**Example scenario:** You're preparing for a performance review with your manager. The AI walks you through professional vocabulary (*""I'd like to discuss my career trajectory""*), appropriate hedging language (*""I was hoping we could explore...""*), and cultural norms around self-advocacy in English-speaking workplaces.

# 📱 Social & Casual English

Master the informal English that textbooks rarely teach—the slang, fillers, and conversational patterns that make you sound natural rather than textbook-perfect.

**Example scenario:** You're at a party where you don't know anyone. NPCs demonstrate small talk patterns, teach you how to gracefully exit conversations, and model the casual register that native speakers use with peers.

# ✈️ Travel English

Practice the specific vocabulary and scenarios you'll encounter while traveling—airports, hotels, restaurants, asking for directions, handling problems.

**Example scenario:** Your flight is delayed and you need to rebook. The AI walks you through airline vocabulary, teaches you how to advocate for yourself politely but firmly, and prepares you for the rapid-fire English of customer service interactions.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is Learn English Through Roleplay AI free?

You can access [Learn English Through Roleplay AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) through Jenova's platform. Free users get limited usage, while subscribers get expanded access and additional features.

# What English level do I need to start?

The AI adapts to any level from complete beginner (A1) to advanced (C2). Beginners receive maximum scaffolding—every dialogue line includes pronunciation guides and translations. Advanced learners get natural English with minimal support.

# Do I need to respond in English?

No. You participate in your native language, and learning happens through exposure and comprehension. This removes the anxiety of forced production and lets you absorb English naturally before you're ready to speak.

# Can I choose what scenarios to explore?

Absolutely. You select the setting (modern, fantasy, professional, etc.), tone (realistic, dramatic, romantic), and themes you want to explore. The AI creates personalized narratives based on your interests.

# How is this different from language learning apps?

Most apps focus on isolated vocabulary drills and grammar exercises. [This tool](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) teaches through immersive storytelling, where language is always connected to meaningful context and emotional engagement—the conditions under which the brain learns most effectively.

# Does it teach pronunciation?

Yes. Every new vocabulary word includes a simplified phonetic guide showing stress patterns (e.g., *buh-REE-stuh* for ""barista""), and dialogue lines include text-to-speech links so you can hear natural pronunciation.

# Start Your English Journey

Language acquisition doesn't have to feel like studying. When learning is embedded in stories that matter to you, vocabulary sticks, grammar makes sense, and fluency develops naturally.

[**Learn English Through Roleplay AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/learn-english-through-roleplay) transforms English learning from a chore into an adventure. Whether you're a complete beginner building foundational vocabulary or an advanced learner polishing your idioms and register awareness, the AI adapts to meet you where you are and guide you forward.

The research is clear: emotional engagement, contextual learning, and narrative structure dramatically improve language retention. Stop memorizing. Start living the language.

I’m 29F, born and raised in the Fremont Milpitas area. A lot of my friendships have slowly drifted over the years thanks to moves, relationships, busy schedules, and life doing its thing. Suddenly I looked around and realized… wait, where is my consistent group of girls??

So here I am. Shooting my shot for friendship.

About me:
I love baking and my current favorite is Jalapeño Cheese bread. I garden and get overly attached to my plants. I’m into arts and crafts and will try any mildly unhinged Pinterest project at least once. I love trying new cocktail spots, exploring cute places around the Bay, going on hikes, and pretending I am outdoorsy but in a balanced way.

I’m looking for girls in their late 20s or early 30s who want real, regular hangouts. Not just a one time coffee that fades into nothing. I want birthday dinners, random weeknight plans, group chats that are a little chaotic, and friendships that actually last.

If you also want a solid group and are tired of saying “we should hang out sometime” with no follow through, let’s fix that.

I deleted Hinge because I don’t want to rely on dating apps to meet someone new. My last relationship started on a dating app, and in the beginning, it felt like we had a lot in common. But over time, it became clear that we were actually very different. He said our lack of commonalities was one of the reasons we broke up.

Because of that experience, I feel like if I meet someone more organically, through my day to day life there’s a higher chance we’ll naturally share more interests and values.

I go out with my girlfriends fairly often, but most of our plans are at home dinners, get togethers, trips, or going out to eat. I also spend a lot of time with my brother and his friends (they’re between 25–32). We work out together, Hyrox training, marathons, grab coffee and breakfast, organize family style dinners, watch shows, and sometimes go out to bars.

I genuinely love this group. They’re sweet, funny, they respect me and protect me when I’m with them, we all love working out and enjoy doing it together (we are very competitive and push each other to be better), we have a great dynamic.

Recently, I mentioned to a friend that when I go out, no one really approaches me. She suggested that maybe my brother and his friends are unintentionally “cockblocking”me, that other guys might assume I'm dating one of them or feel intimidated because they're all attractive and fit.

1rbdjkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyCompass/comments/1rbdjkb/how_to_watch_porn_in_north_carolina/,How to Watch Porn in North Carolina,"You opened Pornhub. Got a lecture instead of a video. Maybe a pop-up demanding you upload a government ID before seeing anything.

Welcome to North Carolina in 2026.

Here's the thing that bugs me: you're a consenting adult trying to access perfectly legal content, and the state has decided the solution to protecting minors is making *you* submit sensitive personal documents to a website that may or may not be equipped to handle that data responsibly. Pornhub's response to this was... blunt. They just pulled out of the state entirely rather than build a verification system they consider a privacy disaster waiting to happen.

Can't entirely blame them.

A VPN fixes this. It's legal, it takes about four minutes to set up, and you'll never have to show your ID to a porn site again. Let me walk you through exactly how.

# What Actually Happened in North Carolina

**House Bill 8** — officially called the Pornography Age Verification Enforcement Act, or `PAVE` — became law on September 29, 2023, and kicked in January 1, 2024. The bill passed almost unanimously. We're talking a 102-8 vote in the House, unanimous in the Senate. Bipartisan, which is rare enough that it's almost impressive in a depressing way.

The law requires any commercial website where more than a third of content qualifies as ""harmful to minors"" to verify every user's age through either a government database or some ""commercially reasonable"" identity check. Photo ID, biometric face scan — the sites get to pick their poison.

>**The result?** Sites like Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn, and Brazzers (all owned by Aylo) decided verification was a privacy nightmare and blocked North Carolina entirely. Sites like xHamster and Chaturbate stayed but now demand ID before you see anything.

NC is far from alone at this point. As of early 2026, roughly 25 U.S. states have enacted similar laws — and the Supreme Court ruled these laws *constitutional* in June 2025, so legal challenges aren't going to save anyone. The wave is still expanding, with ten more states pushing for legislation in 2026.

# Why a VPN Actually Solves This

When you connect to a VPN, your traffic routes through one of the provider's servers before going anywhere on the internet. From Pornhub's perspective, you're connecting from wherever that server is — not from Raleigh or Charlotte or wherever you're actually sitting.

North Carolina residents connecting through a New York server look like New Yorkers. New York has no age verification law. Access restored.

And there's a secondary benefit that honestly matters just as much: your ISP — Spectrum, AT&T, whoever — can no longer see what you're doing. Without a VPN, your internet provider builds a running log of every domain you visit. With one running `WireGuard` or `Lightway` encryption, they see nothing useful.

**Four minutes. That's how long this takes:**

1. Pick a VPN from the list below and sign up
2. Download the app (works on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS — all of them)
3. Open the app and connect to a server in a state without age verification laws (New York, California, Nevada, and Ohio all work fine)
4. Visit the site

Done.

# The VPN Options Worth Considering

I'm going to be straight with you: every VPN review site on the internet gets commission from recommending NordVPN first. That doesn't mean NordVPN is *bad* — it's not, it's genuinely solid — but I want you to have the full picture rather than just taking a payday-driven ranking at face value.

Here's what actually matters for this use case: **no-logs policy**, **server locations in non-restricted states or countries**, and **speed** (because buffering in the middle of a video is its own special annoyance).

|VPN|No-Logs Audited?|Server Count|Price/mo (2yr)|Kill Switch|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|✅ Yes (annual)|9,000+ in 130 countries|\~$3.09|✅ App & system level|Speed + security|
|**ProtonVPN**|✅ Yes (open-source)|18,100+ in 129 countries|\~$2.99|✅|Privacy purists|
|**ExpressVPN**|✅ Yes (KPMG)|3,000+ in 105 countries|\~$2.44|✅|Ease of use|
|**Surfshark**|✅ Yes|3,200+ in 100 countries|\~$1.99|✅|Budget + unlimited devices|
|**IPVanish**|✅ Yes (Schellman/Leviathan)|Large fleet|\~$2.19|✅|iOS split tunneling|

*Prices as of early 2026. All offer 30-day money-back guarantees.*

**Quick takes:**

**NordVPN** is what most testing labs land on when they need pure consistency. Their `WireGuard`\-based `NordLynx` protocol is fast enough that you genuinely won't notice you're running through a VPN on most connections. Their Threat Protection Pro feature also blocks malicious ads — which matters more than you'd think on adult sites, which historically serve some genuinely sketchy ad networks.

**ProtonVPN** is what I'd pick if I were paranoid about the VPN itself being compromised. Swiss jurisdiction (outside U.S. data-sharing agreements), open-source code that anyone can audit, and the largest server fleet of the bunch. It also has a *free tier*, which is rare among legitimate providers. The free version works but caps speeds — fine for testing, limiting for actual use.

**Surfshark** lets you cover unlimited devices on one subscription. So your laptop, your phone, your tablet — all protected, one monthly fee. For the price, it's hard to argue with.

# Which Server Should You Actually Connect To?

Short answer: any state without age verification laws. As of February 2026, states where you can connect freely include **New York**, **California**, **Nevada**, **Ohio**, **Washington**, and **Pennsylvania**, among others. Connecting to a Canadian server works too — Canada has no federal equivalent to these laws.

>**Avoid connecting to:** Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Utah, Virginia, Montana, and the other \~21 restricted states. You'd just be hitting the same wall from a different direction.

If you want maximum certainty, pick a server in a country entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction — Canada, Germany, Netherlands are all reliable choices and generally fast for U.S. users.

# What About Free VPNs and Tor?

Tor will make you feel like it's 2008 and you're on a satellite connection. The multi-hop encryption slows everything to a crawl, and you can't choose your exit location reliably — which means you might route through a restricted state anyway. Pass.

Free VPNs are a different problem. The ones worth using are essentially limited versions of paid services (Proton's free tier is the main exception). The ones that are actually free — as in, free because *you're* the product — log everything and sell it. That's... exactly the opposite of what you're trying to accomplish here.

Paid VPNs running `WireGuard` or `Lightway` are fast enough that you won't notice any slowdown. The math works out to around $2–3 a month on a two-year plan. That's less than a specialty coffee.

# Is Using a VPN Here Actually Legal?

Yes. Completely.

Using a VPN is legal everywhere in the United States, North Carolina included. The laws target *websites*, requiring them to implement verification — they don't criminalize users for bypassing geo-restrictions. You're an adult accessing legal content. The VPN is just how you preserve your privacy while doing it.

The privacy concern is legitimate, by the way. Submitting a government ID to a porn site creates a record that: (a) your ID has been verified and associated with an account on that platform, (b) that data exists somewhere and could be breached, and (c) you've handed over biometric data in some cases. Pornhub's decision to block states rather than collect that data was, arguably, the more responsible choice.

# Sites Still Accessible in NC Without a VPN

Not everything blocked out. Two notable holdouts:

|Site|Status|Verification Method|
|:-|:-|:-|
|xHamster|⚠️ Accessible|ID required|
|Chaturbate|⚠️ Accessible|ID required|
|Pornhub / RedTube / YouPorn / Brazzers|❌ Blocked|N/A — full block|

If you're okay submitting ID to xHamster's verification system, that's your call. I'm not here to make that choice for you. But if privacy matters — and I'd argue it probably should — VPN is the cleaner path.

# Setting Up in Plain English

**Step 1:** Go to NordVPN.com (or whichever provider you chose), pick a plan, and pay. The two-year plans are dramatically cheaper than monthly.

**Step 2:** Download the app for your device. All the major providers support Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, and even browser extensions.

**Step 3:** Open the app. Don't overthink the settings on day one. Click `Quick Connect` or manually select New York or Canada from the server list.

**Step 4:** Watch the connection indicator flip to ""Connected."" Now open whatever site you want.

**Step 5:** Enable the kill switch in settings. This is the feature that cuts your internet if the VPN drops unexpectedly, preventing your real IP from briefly leaking. It's off by default on most apps. Turn it on.

That's it. You're done.

# A Note on the Broader Picture

North Carolina was early. It's not unusual anymore — half the country has these laws now, the Supreme Court blessed them in June 2025, and the other half is actively working on similar legislation. The EU has been pushing equivalent requirements in several member states. The UK's Online Safety Act enforcement kicked in July 2025.

A VPN that works in NC will work when your state inevitably joins this list too. Treat it like insurance: you want it set up before you need it, not after.

I’m 29F, born and raised in the Fremont Milpitas area. A lot of my friendships have slowly drifted over the years thanks to moves, relationships, busy schedules, and life doing its thing. Suddenly I looked around and realized… wait, where is my consistent group of girls??

Not ghosts. Not demons. Not “presences.”

Just creaky houses and overactive imaginations.

Until things in my house started moving.

At first it was small.

A chair slightly pulled out.

Cabinet doors open when I knew I shut them.

My bathroom light on when I woke up.

I told myself it was stress. Lack of sleep.

I live alone, so there was no one else to blame but my own mind.

But then I started waking up tired.

Not normal tired.

That deep, heavy exhaustion like I hadn’t slept at all.

Every morning at exactly 3:17 a.m., I’d wake up for no reason.

No sound.

No nightmare.

Just awake. Heart racing.

Always 3:17.

So three nights ago, I bought a cheap camera and set it up in my living room facing the hallway that leads to my bedroom.

I told myself I’d finally prove nothing was happening.

That night, I went to bed at 11:08 p.m.

Locked my door. Checked the windows. Everything normal.

I woke up at 7:02 a.m.

And for the first time in weeks… I felt rested.

I actually laughed. I thought, “See? Nothing’s wrong.”

Then I remembered the camera.

I made coffee, sat down, and opened the footage.

Everything looked normal at first.

12:00 a.m. — dark living room.

1:00 a.m. — nothing.

2:00 a.m. — complete silence.

Then 3:16 a.m.

My bedroom door slowly opened.

I stopped breathing.

I live alone.

And I always sleep with my door shut.

The door opened just enough to reveal the darkness inside my room.

And then…

Something moved in the doorway.

Not walking.

Not crawling.

Sliding.

Like a silhouette peeling itself off the darkness inside my bedroom.

It stepped into the hallway.

Tall. Too tall. Its head nearly brushed the top of the door frame.

But the worst part?

It moved wrong.

Like it didn’t understand how joints worked. Jerky. Delayed.

Like it was copying how a person walks after only watching from far away.

It stood in the hallway for a full minute.

Just… staring directly at the camera.

I couldn’t see its face. Only a shape darker than the dark.

Then at 3:17 a.m., the timestamp glitched.

The screen distorted.

And the thing turned its head toward my bedroom.

Where I was sleeping.

Then it walked back inside my room.

The door slowly closed behind it.

I slammed my laptop shut.

I didn’t want to watch anymore.

But something felt wrong.

Very wrong.

Because I suddenly remembered something.

I sleep on my back.

And I always face the door.

With shaking hands, I opened the footage again and skipped forward.

7:01 a.m.

My bedroom door opened again.

I watched myself walk out.

Same clothes I went to bed in.

Same posture.

But something about it was off.

Too stiff. Too slow. Too precise.

Like a puppet pretending to be me.

It walked into the living room.

Stopped.

And then slowly leaned down… directly into the camera lens.

For the first time, I saw its face clearly.

It was me.

But stretched.

Skin too tight. Smile too wide. Eyes open just a little too much.

And it whispered in my voice:

“He wakes up at 3:17 every night.”

I felt my chest tighten reading the timestamp.

Because I had woken up at 3:17 for weeks.

The video kept playing.

The thing wearing my face stood there for six minutes.

Not blinking. Not moving.

Just staring into the camera.

Then at 3:23 a.m., it suddenly snapped its head toward the hallway.

Like it heard something.

Footsteps.

Real footsteps.

Coming from my bedroom.

Another me walked out.

This one looked normal.

Sleepy. Disoriented.

It looked around the living room… confused.

Then froze when it saw the thing standing at the camera.

The footage has no audio.

But I could see my own mouth moving.

Asking something.

The thing tilted its head slowly.

And smiled wider.

Then the video cut to static.

That’s where the file ends.

Here’s the part that made me leave my house immediately.

I checked the camera’s storage.

It said the camera only started recording at 3:16 a.m.

Not 11:00 p.m.

Not midnight.

Not 2:00 a.m.

Which means the footage of the dark, empty house before that…

Was never actually recorded.

And the final detail I can’t explain:

Last night, I slept at my friend’s apartment across town.

No cameras.

No strange noises.

Nothing unusual.

But I still woke up suddenly.

Heart pounding.

Wide awake.

I checked the time on my phone.

3:17 a.m.

And my camera app — the one connected to the house camera — had sent a motion alert.

From inside my empty house.

I opened the clip.

The living room was dark.

Silent.

Still.

Then, from the hallway…

My bedroom door slowly opened.

And something stepped out.

Looked directly into the camera.

And in my exact voice, it whispered:

# Cliff notes version (and/or scroll down to 'Final Note')

It's essentially saying that society makes homebodies feel like there is something wrong with them, but it's total bullshit. 

\*And we know that when it comes to us it becomes particularly pathologised bullshit. \*

**Quotes**

*- The narrative that something’s wrong with preferring home is outdated.*

*- Design your life around your actual preferences, not what you think you should want.*

# <Article Title>

Psychology says people who genuinely prefer staying home aren't anxious or antisocial — they reached a point where the energy required to perform comfort in other people's spaces stopped being worth what they got back </>

# <Article text>

Last weekend, I watched my neighbor apologize profusely for declining another dinner invitation.

“I’m just so boring lately,” she said, forcing a laugh that didn’t reach her eyes.

The shame in her voice was unmistakable.

She’d convinced herself that preferring her couch to crowded restaurants meant something was wrong with her.

But here’s what most people miss: choosing solitude isn’t a character flaw.

The latest research reveals something fascinating about those of us who genuinely prefer staying home.

We’re not broken.

We’re not depressed.

We’ve simply done the math on what social interactions actually cost us versus what we gain.

# The energy equation nobody talks about

Think about the last time you went to a party you didn’t really want to attend.

Remember the preparation?

The mental rehearsal of small talk topics.

The outfit decisions.

The internal pep talk in the car.

Now add up all that invisible labor.

Introverts are often drained by social interactions and need time alone to recharge.

This isn’t weakness.

This is biology.

Every social interaction requires performance energy.

You modulate your voice for the room’s acoustics.

You mirror body language.

You filter thoughts before they become words.

You scan for social cues while maintaining eye contact.

Your brain processes multiple conversations bleeding into each other.

For some of us, this energy expenditure has stopped making sense.

# When authenticity becomes non-negotiable

I discovered something crucial during my transition to minimalist living.

The same principle that led me to pare down my possessions applied to my social life.

Why was I maintaining relationships that required me to be someone else?

Why was I attending events where I couldn’t hear myself think?

Social psychologist [Thuy-vy Nguyen](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/202006/phonies-dont-like-spending-time-alone-authentic-people-do) shares a powerful insight from a participant in his study: “I found it enjoyable to be in my own company.”

This simple statement challenges everything we’ve been taught about happiness.

The narrative says connection equals joy.

But what if you’ve already connected deeply with yourself?

What if home is where you feel most yourself?

# The performance trap of modern socializing

Modern social gatherings have become increasingly performative.

Everyone’s curating their experience for social media.

Conversations happen in soundbites designed for later retelling.

The pressure to appear interesting, successful, and eternally positive is exhausting.

Here’s what I’ve noticed about genuinely content homebodies:

• They’ve stopped confusing busy with meaningful

• They protect their energy like a finite resource

• They choose depth over breadth in relationships

• They’ve released the fear of missing out

• They trust their own company

These aren’t signs of dysfunction.

They’re signs of self-awareness.

# Redefining connection on your terms

Staying home doesn’t mean cutting off from humanity.

I maintain deep friendships.

I just prefer meeting one friend for tea over navigating a loud restaurant with eight people.

I choose video calls where I can control my environment over chaotic coffee shops.

My relationships have actually deepened since I stopped spreading myself thin.

Quality over quantity isn’t just a minimalist principle for possessions.

The people who matter understand when you say you’d rather stay in.

They don’t take it personally.

They might even admit they feel the same.

# The cost of pretending to be an extrovert

Society rewards extroverted behavior.

The loudest voice in the meeting gets heard.

The person working the room gets promoted.

The social butterfly gets invited everywhere.

But at what cost?

I spent years forcing myself into loud environments that left my nervous system frayed.

I’d need three days to recover from one networking event.

The math never worked.

Was that two-hour cocktail party worth 72 hours of recovery?

Was that promotion worth chronic exhaustion?

# Permission to choose differently

Here’s what changed everything for me: realizing I didn’t need anyone’s permission to prefer solitude.

Not my extroverted friends.

Not my family.

Not society.

The moment you stop defending your choices is the moment you start living authentically.

You don’t owe anyone an explanation for why you’d rather read than go to brunch.

You don’t need to justify why you leave parties early.

Actually, you don’t need to go to parties at all.

# Creating a life that honors your nature

Design your life around your actual preferences, not what you think you should want.

If you’re energized by solitude, build in more alone time.

If crowds drain you, stop accepting invitations out of obligation.

If small talk feels like sandpaper on your soul, seek deeper conversations instead.

This isn’t about becoming a hermit.

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656620300222) found that introverted individuals tend to prefer secluded spaces, indicating a comfort in staying home over socializing in public areas.

This preference isn’t pathology.

It’s self-knowledge.

# Final thoughts

The narrative that something’s wrong with preferring home is outdated.

We’re not anxious shut-ins or antisocial misfits.

We’ve simply recognized that performing comfort in spaces designed for others isn’t worth the energy it requires.

Your home is your sanctuary.

Your solitude is sacred.

Your preferences are valid.

The next time someone suggests you need to “get out more,” remember this: you’re not missing out by staying in.

You’re choosing to spend your energy on what actually nourishes you.

And that’s the most social thing you can do for yourself.

Adorno.","Worth spending 45 minutes for this video.  It definitely will improve perspective, creating own perspective rather borrowed one.

It is about a book Dialectic of Enlightenment-  work of philosophy and social criticism, written by Frankfurt School philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. Book published in 1947 but very relevant in today’s time.

Notes prepared from video of Dharmendra Sir:

\- Art, Music has immense influence on us. 

\- People used to believe in myths earlier and with spread of science & study, people have become aware but is awareness real? Or limited to become slaves of capitalists?

\- ⁠Madness- now people stand in queues to buy mobile phone though they pay full, roaming around the world, spending lakhs in destination wedding just to prove that they are more aware.

\- Capitalist will enforce standardisations. They will decide what to consume with minimal difference in choices.

\- ⁠⁠Culture industry- kill the curiosity, kill the creativity (by limiting range to play with), enforce people accept the system.

\- ⁠School syllabus decided by intellectuals- a person spends prime years of childhood & young age in schools but no one guarantees job- as it comes with skill but that person can’t ask a question to the system.

\- ⁠System has decided path by standardisation.

\- ⁠Go with the flow mentality- passive consumption 

\- ⁠Feel of pseudo individualism: I am different. I have power to choose. Reality, I am a slave. My choices are standardised and decided by the system. False feeling of smartness. “Consumer is the king.”

\- ⁠Same content in all shampoos, tooth pastes but customer feels proud when given 10 choices. I am something!

\- ⁠Old system- Active customer: Need - Logic - Demand - Supply

\- ⁠New system- Passive customer: Production - Supply - Advertisement - Passive Thought- Purchase. Need becomes passive in new system. 

\- ⁠Commodification: Culture & events used to be celebrated for happiness. Now they have become product on sale. Like valentine day, Father’s Day. Feelings used to be expressed without day but now market will decide when to express. Gifts are with these days &  commoditised.

\- ⁠Personal life, family, most private- spiritually has become commodity. Everything is a commodity in market of capitalists, even religions.

\- ⁠Selling becomes easy when a consumer is passive- products sold on feeling (I am something) instead of need.

\- ⁠Buying cars, watches, tours on EMI, to show off status (I am more aware) to people in passive mode.

\- ⁠Passive consumption:  Buy, buy, buy. Brand of coffee is more important than coffee itself in cup.

\- ⁠When a person becomes passive consumer, he participates in a race.

\- ⁠Amusement is prolongation of work: After work no content is to be given which takes you to the self enquiry. Content will be served to push you to more passiveness. E.g. 99% people are aware that big boss is scripted still people watch. IPL. Serials with 400+ episodes. Reel culture. All are passive entertainment. Let people imbibes these habits. Then they will become passive consumers (buy buy buy, not basis on need but basis on showing off, my life my (fake) rules)

\- ⁠Passive entertainment > Passive consumer > Passive work class (person wanted to become painter but became engineer looking at mass) > Passive voters (will not ask questions to Govt so any politician would want this crowd)

\- ⁠Passive crowd becomes fan of like minded passive (like brainless, less educated influencers, stand up comedians, politicians etc.) and they will start hating Active person (critical thinker).

\- ⁠Intellectuals will leave or become silent. 

\- ⁠Effect on family- power of older generations will be snatched which market wants. Wise will become silent, brainless will become powerful. Selling hopes becomes easy to these brainless, selling fair glow cream to educated girls/ boys become easy to passive. Is skin important or skill? Passive brainless will opt former which market wants.

\- ⁠Passive brains like zombies are very easy to control.

\- ⁠Passiveness starts from entertainment- art.

\- ⁠Next time when you buy something, ask yourself if it is not making you more passive?

\- ⁠We are not living but, performing according to system.",1,1771737152.0,Philosophy_India,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying out AttaPoll recently (it’s a survey app that pays you for answering questions), and I wanted to share my experience and see what others think.

I downloaded AttaPoll a little while ago because I was looking for small ways to make extra cash in my free time. I won’t lie I wasn’t expecting much. So far, it’s been okay? Some days I qualify for multiple surveys and can make a few bucks pretty quickly. Other days I get screened out over and over, which gets frustrating.

I’m definitely not treating it like a job or anything more like “coffee money”.

But so far I think it’s pretty good I would recommed it

For those curious, here’s what I sent out today:



**Picks (2/3)**

\-DET Pistons -10.5 (-110) ✅

\-HOU Rockets +3.5 (-115) ✅

‍-SA Spurs -18.0 (-110) ❌



**Player Props (2/4)**

\-HOU Rockets v NY Knicks: Kevin Durant Over 33.5 Points, Rebounds & Assists (-110) ✅

\-MEM Grizzlies v MIA Heat: Norman Powell Over 26.5 Points, Rebounds & Assists (-120) ✅

\-MEM Grizzlies v MIA Heat: Tyler Herro Over 17.5 Points (-110) ❌

\-DET Pistons v CHI Bulls: Cade Cunningham Over 25.5 Points (-105) ❌

 

**Parlay (+581) (MISS)**

\-MIA Heat Team Total Over 123.5 (-115) ✅

\-SA Spurs Team Total Over 124.5 (-110) ✅

\-HOU Rockets v NY Knicks Over 219.0 (-110) ❌

‍

I’ll be honest, **I thought we had both the picks sweep AND the parlay in the bag**. I can’t believe **the Spurs blew it in the last minute of the game** – they went from being up 28 points to being up just 17 in a mere 1:30?! I’m stunned. 

 

**Thank God the Rockets held on (barely)** – they managed to cover the spread, but they went from being up 16 on the Knicks to finishing down 2! The Over was looking *very* promising until Houston hit the brakes in the 4th quarter… 

 

We nearly had a couple of bad beats, but I’m glad it was limited to just the one. Of course, I always hate it when *Pick of the Day* is our only miss on picks. We took a minimal loss, but nothing crazy enough do dampen the spirit of our hot streak 😉

 

Alright everyone, that’s all I’ve got for the evening! Enjoy the rest of your night, and as always, I’ll see you all bright and early to conquer the books.

1rbd1ze,https://i.redd.it/xh220aq9bzkg1.jpeg,Over the Constant Controversy Around Cache Coffee,"I’m someone who generally considers myself conservative, so this isn’t coming from a place of political opposition. It’s coming from fatigue.

At some point, it feels like Cache Coffee has leaned into controversy as part of its brand. Whether intentional or not, there’s a recurring pattern of dramatic posts, polarizing messaging, and stories that are impossible for customers to verify. And honestly? It’s exhausting.

I don’t go to a coffee shop to feel like I’m stepping into a culture war or a marketing strategy built around outrage. I go for good coffee, good service, and a place to relax or work. When a business consistently positions itself in the middle of hot-button issues, it starts to feel less authentic and more like posturing.

If you’re going to make bold claims or tell emotionally charged stories, I think it’s fair for customers to expect transparency and accountability. Otherwise, it can come across as pandering; especially when the narratives conveniently align with whichever audience engagement is most beneficial in the moment.

This isn’t about silencing anyone’s beliefs. Businesses can absolutely have values. But there’s a difference between having values and constantly amplifying controversy in a way that feels strategic.

1rbcyeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1rbcyeo/houses_are_alive/,Houses are Alive,"My Mother used to say that Houses are Alive. She wasn’t wrong.

I moved back into my mother’s house two months ago.

It wasn’t part of the plan. The plan was to rent somewhere small, get my bearings again after she died, and maybe try to rebuild the pieces of my life that fell apart with her. But when I went to collect her things, I couldn’t leave. There was something about the house, something that felt like unfinished business.

It’s the same old two-story I grew up in. White siding, creaky porch, the faint smell of dust and lavender.

My mother loved that smell. She said it calmed the house down.

Even as a kid, though, I never felt calm here. I used to tell her the walls made noises when I was alone, little groans, sighs, a kind of hum when I cried.

She’d laugh and say *“Old houses settle, Clara. They creak because they’re alive in their own way.”*

I thought she meant it metaphorically. I don’t anymore.

The first few nights back were normal enough. Lonely, yes. Too quiet.

I couldn’t sleep in my old bedroom, it still had those faint outlines on the wall from where I’d taped up posters, like ghosts of teenage years I’d rather forget. So I took my mother’s room instead. Her perfume lingered on the curtains, and the bed still dipped on her side, as if she’d only just gotten up.

I started cleaning during the day. Sorting through her things. Trying to make the place feel like *mine*.

That’s when it started, small things, things I told myself were coincidence.

One afternoon I caught myself thinking *this dresser would* look *better by the* window. The next morning, it was. I laughed it off, assuming I’d moved it and forgotten.

But then it happened again.

I was reaching for the hallway light switch, but the switch wasn’t there. Instead, it was on the *other* wall, right where my hand had hesitated a moment before.

My stomach dropped, like missing a step on the stairs.

I told myself I was misremembering, that grief makes people fuzzy. That night, I walked through the house taking pictures, of the layout, of where everything was, so I could prove to myself it wasn’t moving.

The next day, the photos didn’t match.

It wasn’t dramatic, not at first. Doors an inch off, stair count one higher. The kitchen window slightly taller. I thought maybe I was going insane. I even scheduled an appointment with a therapist. But then, the house started… helping me.

When I’d think about coffee, I’d find the mug already waiting on the counter.  
When I’d feel cold, the heat would hum to life without me touching the thermostat.  
One night, I couldn’t find my phone, I whispered, “Where did I leave it?” and the bedroom light flickered, like a nod. I found it glowing on the nightstand.

It felt like the house cared.

It was subtle, intimate, almost maternal. Like it wanted to take care of me the way she used to.

I told myself that was comforting.

But comfort doesn’t last here.

The first time I got angry, I felt it breathe.

I was trying to open a jammed drawer, my mother’s old jewelry box, the one with the music that never worked, and it wouldn’t budge. I yanked harder, muttering under my breath, *“For God’s sake, open!”*

Every door in the house slammed at once.

The windows rattled. The air pressure changed, like before a storm. And then… it was still.

I stood there shaking, trying to laugh it off. *“Old houses,”* I whispered. But I could feel something watching me, not from a corner or doorway, but from the walls themselves.

After that, I started testing it.

When I felt sad, the lights dimmed.

When I panicked, the hallway stretched, I swear to you, it elongated, the end of it sliding further away as I ran. When I calmed down, it shrank again.

I told myself it was grief. Stress. Trauma. All the buzzwords therapists love to use.

But then, I started noticing something worse.

The house wasn’t reacting *to* me anymore. It was *anticipating.*

I’d reach for the faucet, it would turn before my fingers touched it. I’d think about checking the mail, and hear the front door unlatch on its own. I’d dream about my mother, and wake up to find her perfume thick in the air, as if she’d been standing right over me.

The final straw was the basement.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

1rbcy4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1rbcy4b/colombia_world_packers_trip_first_month/,Colombia World Packers trip first month,"Hello everyone. 

  
I've been in Colombia since January 26, so about a month, and I wanted to give you guys an update on my experience so far. I will be here until May and will give monthly updates and maybe eventually a speaking video (if I'm not too nervous). I also need to note this is my third trip to Colombia, and the whole reason I wanted to do World Packers is to give back to a country that has given me so much. 

  
My first week I was in Pereira, a city I know very well. This week was UNA CHIMBA! I'm a drummer and I play and listen to lots of salsa music and for the first time I was able to play salsa live with other people and this got me lots of rep. I already knew some of the people at the bar I played at from my previous trips but this lead to meeting more people and developing more connections in my favorite city in Colombia. 

The last three weeks I was in Filandia. Filandia is a small pueblo in the coffee region with gorgeous colonial architecture which is why I wanted to go back. It was once one of the major coffee producers of the region but the construction of a highway between Pereira and Armenia made Filandia feel like its almost stuck in time, and that's why I love it. 

  
I didn't think I would make so many friends in a town with only 10,000 people but I was wrong. I made sure to find restaurants, stores, cafes and bars I like and I would frequent them. This led to deep connections and amazing friendships that I will cherish forever. I highly recommend anyone going to Colombia to make a day trip to Filandia the town is so colorful. 

  
Now the emotional parts aside let's get down to the spanish aspect. 

  
I'm at almost 1000 hours. I only count watched videos/series, and not my conversations from meeting people and working with native speakers the last year so its maybe a little higher. I also am not a purist as I used language transfer at the start. 

  
Doing volunteer work at a hotel was a little difficult at times, but not impossible. Everybody was pretty patient with me and Im very clearly not a native speaker if you look at me. Every once in a while I would ask people to repeat what they were saying but even if I dont understand 100% of what people are saying I get the point, if not the first time then the second time. Im usually pretty down on myself tbh but i realized that if I only need to ask once for clarification and then I ubderstand that isn't too bad. 

  
I still watch 20-60 minutes of DS daily to hekp with my comprehension, but I am starting to realize as much as I enjoy the guides, we're kind of spoiled. They speak clearly with high quality gear. When you meet a 70 year old parking attendent in Filandia, Colombia you will be humbled. This particular man talked to me and I looked at my coworkers and said ""este hombre estaba hablando chino conmigo?"" 

  
Last side night, if you're in Colombia go to the hot springs near Santa Rosa. It will change your life. 

  
Thanks guys!

**AIO? Shady Bridesmaid hijacked Wedding Shower**

**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**

\----

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/s/3TVeDsGvCY): **February 4, 2026**

Throwaway because I don’t want this tied to my main.

My sister is getting married and asked me to be her matron of honor, which I was thrilled about. I love my little sister, and she was my maid of honor when I got married a few years ago. We talk once or twice a week (I have a little one at home, and she’s younger, very social, staying-out-late type).

She’s planning a BIG wedding. Lots of people, lots of moving parts.

As matron of honor, I’m expected to lead planning for the bridal shower and bachelorette party. Since the shower comes first, I asked my sister what vibe she wanted. She said elegant. Perfect. I told her I’ll organize with the bridesmaids and report back to her ideas that she can choose from/approve. I asked her if she had any ideas already, and she said no, but wanted to see what we come up with. She did say she wanted something that would accommodate a lot of people.

I created a group chat with the bridesmaids to start planning. There are three other bridesmaids: two are my sister’s childhood friends (I know them, sweet, collaborative, great people), and one I didn’t know. Let’s call her Shady.

Shady is actually in the main group of friends of my sister’s future husband. They included her as a bridesmaid rather than on the groom’s side for symmetry in the wedding party, but my sister is getting to know her more and she is becoming one of her friend’s too.

We planned an in-person meeting to brainstorm ideas. Everyone showed up on time, except Shady. I texted and called, no answer. After about 30 minutes, I suggested we start planning. We started discussing ideas, games, and venues. I mentioned that I was thinking of some elegant venues, but that they could be pricey. I’m a little bit older and more financially established, so I offered to cover the cost of the venue/restaurant/hotel/studio, and if the other bridesmaids wanted to focus on games, decor, flowers, and themes ideas. They were relieved and agreed since they’re still in or just out of college.

After 45 minutes, Shady shows up and apologizes for being late. We recap everything. She doesn’t offer any ideas, she just listens.

We all chat a bit, get to know each other, and Shady seems friendly, outgoing, and pleasant. We end the meeting with the plan that I’ll tour venues and update the group chat, and everyone else will contribute ideas for games, décor, and themes.

The following week, I took a few days off work and toured several venues. I took photos and shared them in the group chat. The other bridesmaids responded with comments like how beautiful they were, questions about space and menus, etc. the showed pictures of game ideas and themes, etc.

Shady said nothing.

That weekend, I went to my sister’s place to show her everything in person. She casually mentioned that Shady and her boyfriend had been over earlier that day to spend time with her and her future hubby.

Then my sister tells me: Shady had already shown her all the venue photos and ideas from the group chat. She then showed my sister pictures of a friend’s large mansion, complete with floor plans, and suggested hosting the shower there instead with catering.

My sister said she really liked that idea.

I told my sister that if that’s what she wants, I support it. I want her to be happy and have the shower she wants.

But I feel like the rug was pulled out from under me.

I did planning, legwork, touring, and shared everything with the group. Shady said nothing in the chat, then went directly to my sister behind the scenes with some other plan that she did not want to share with the bridesmaid group?

Was this shady behavior, or am I overreacting?

Do I confront Shady, or keep quiet to avoid drama during my sister’s wedding?

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I would bring it up in the group chat to let the others girls know the ideas “shady” came up with so all of you are on the same page. My question is being “shady” came up with the mansion does that mean it’s free because it’s her friends or will she be covering that expense.

> **OOP:** It will be free because it is at someone’s house. My sister will also likely add this additional person to the guest list if she’s hosting the party for the shower. I imagine the bridal party will divide costs for food? I’m going to make a group chat informing the other bridesmaids of the change. I don’t know how to word it without sounding upset right now.

**Commenter 2:** I'm going to play devil's advocate here. When you were at the bridal planning , she could not offer up a second person's house without speaking to them first.

She absolutely had to confirm with that person before she made the offer. And then once she got a confirmation that it could be done , she likely told your sister because she knows your sister better and she spoke to your sister before she spoke to you.

She might be shady, but I don't think this is that deep.

The only way you're gonna know is if you talk to her. But if you don't talk to her and you just start bailing out of things and s\*\*\* talking her without finding out what happened , then you're going to be the one who's bringing drama.

> **OOP:** I appreciate you giving a possible way to view this. I’m not the type to burn the house down if something goes wrong, so I’m not in any way going to stop being there for my sister or step down from being her MOH.
> 
> I just think there were many opportunities to say, hey- here’s an option. I can check with my friend if it is possible.
> 
> That would have been great.

**Commenter 3:** Honestly, leave this one alone and tell your sister that you’re leaving the planning of everything else to Shady because of what she did. Let her know you don’t have time for this and cut off the drama at the head.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/s/YENRpvqbfK): **February 15, 2026 (11 days later)**

AIO: Shady bridesmaid hijacked shower UPDATE

**UPDATE: Somehow things got worse! This is long. Sorry all.**

First post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/s/lpl0RsU4BV ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/s/lpl0RsU4BV)

Remember when I said I didn’t want to cause drama for my sister? Well I failed.

After my sister told me she wanted to go with Shady’s mansion shower plan, I decided to be an adult and call Shady directly.

She didn’t answer.

So I sent a polite text saying I had spoken to my sister, she mentioned the mansion idea, and I was just confused about how the group chat planning pivoted into a fully formed alternate event. Very calm. Very “just trying to understand.”

She texted back instead of calling.

She said she doesn’t have a sister of her own and really wants to do this for my sister. Okay.

She did not address why she didn’t bring this up in the group chat.

Then she added that she already has a menu planned, my sister agreed to it, she will be covering the cost, and all the bridesmaids have to do is show up and enjoy.

Oh, and she plans to use one of the games we discussed in the group chat.

Excuse me?

So now she’s throwing the shower. Featuring one recycled game from the peasants. I know I’m not paying anything for this, so she’s not looking to take advantage of my generosity.

I probably shouldn’t have, but I responded that this was something I had really wanted to do for MY only sister, and I was disappointed I didn’t even get to be part of it.

Then I called my sister to explain the conversation.

My sister said yes, she’s good with this plan, this is what she wants, and I can just focus on the bachelorette party.

If this is what she wants, fine. I will swallow it. But I felt… disappointed? Replaced? Weirdly pushed out?

So I sent a neutral message to the group chat saying that Shady would be taking over the shower planning and that it would be at her friend’s home.

My phone rang immediately.

One of the bridesmaids (we’ll call her Sweetie) calls me absolutely shocked because she knew how passionate I was about doing this for my sister. I explained what happened. She was upset for me and asked if I wanted her to call Shady and find out why she left us out.

And here is where hindsight punches me in the face.

I said sure.

Sweetie calls Shady.

Shady answers.

Apparently Sweetie did not love the responses she got.

They argue.

Shady then calls my sister.

My sister then calls me.

My sister was upset because there’s conflict. I tried calming her down, but I ended up getting upset too and I yelled. I did apologize. But in that moment I realized my sister just wanted me to quietly make this work and not create waves… and I had just created a tidal wave.

How did we get here???

Fast forward to this past weekend.

We had an unrelated event where all the bridesmaids were present, along with family, and I met my sister’s future in-laws for the first time.

Shady was there.

She did not speak to me. Not once.

Instead, she stayed glued to my sister’s fiancé and his mother.

When I met the future MIL (with Shady standing right there), I immediately got the vibe that she was annoyed with me. Curt. Polite but distant. And I couldn’t help but wonder what version of this story had been told on that side.

I stayed near my sister the whole event. She seemed happy. Sweetie stuck by us too. But there is now this very obvious divide with Shady.

And I feel terrible.

I never wanted to make my sister’s wedding messy. I just wanted to throw her a beautiful shower. Now somehow it feels political.

So now I’m asking:

Did I mishandle this?

Is this a “pick your battles” situation and I picked wrong?

Was I reasonably hurt and this spiraled beyond what I intended?

Because right now I feel like I accidentally became the villain.

**Editor's note: OOP made the same update post onto another subreddit, I am adding comments from that sub for more context**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Damn that Shady has screwed you over. Sadly, you played right in to her hands and now she is the one seen to be ""doing what the bride wants"" and you are the bad guy.  To be honest though, as long as your sister is happy, I'd just let the drama fade away now. 

Totally understand why you are hurt though and I do think that you're NTA

> **OOP:** Thanks for your response. I think this is probably the best way. I appreciate you saying I’m NTA and understand why I am hurt. I don’t think my sister understands that and maybe that’s why this feels unresolved and uncomfortable. And now I’ve got to interact with Shady for the next few months for wedding activities and act like everything is okay.

**Is there any chances that Shady likes the Future BIL and is jealous that he's getting married to OOP's sister?**

> **OOP:** No - I don’t think so. They’ve been friends for many years and he was single for a long time before he met my sister.
> 
> I do think she appreciates his friendship and wants to be involved to a significant degree, but wasn’t happy with me being in charge or leading something she wanted control of.

**Commenter 2:** Sounds to me like Shady has main character syndrome. 

One idea might be for  you and Sweetie, and Xtra Sweetie 😊 to just sit tight and be available anytime your sister reaches out.

And let Shady do her little show, cuz eventually she's gonna slip up and show her ass.   If she is MC type, she's not gonna stop trying taking center stage from you.  It's going to bleed into other aspects of the wedding, and your sister and others will see her as she really is.

But realize now that you can't stop it, based on the dynamics you described.  Know that you can't protect your sister from her because your sister's still buying into it. And she's just going to have to learn about this girl from her own experiences. So there's no reason getting your sister pissed off at you over it. You've already kind of warned her. Now you can just be there when she needs you.

So, just give Shady enough rope and eventually she'll h@ng herself, so to speak. (Obviously not literally; it's an old saying).

It's going to be hard biting your tongue, but just be there for your sister when she needs you. 

PSA: this is just one of multiple certain scenarios that could play out

> **OOP:** This sounds like the route I will go. I’ll just have to accept what happened and just be polite when I see Shady. I don’t like that my sister’s future MIL has such a negative impression of me. Shady is such an ass.

**Commenter 3:** Your sister is an AH and owes you an apology for allowing this friend to treat you so badly. I hope you tell your sister that if she thinks her friend is more of a sister to her then you’ll be stepping back. Your sister is in the wrong here, not only her shitty friend.

> **OOP:** I didn’t really think about this perspective. She really is dismissing my feelings about what happened.
> 
> I’m not going to step down from being her MOH, I love her and will give her grace about this.
> 
> There might be more going on behind the scenes than I know. I know if Shady brought this up when spending time with my sister and my future BIL, I could see my future BIL possibly pushing for this if he thought it was a good idea too, as he is pretty opinionated. This is just speculation, though.

**OOP responds to a long [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1r6160o/aio_shady_bridesmaid_hijacked_shower_update/o5n4mkj/) regarding avoiding making more conflicts and the idea of stepping down as the MOH because her sister is disregarding her and her relationship with OOP**

> **OOP:** I didn’t think about that, but yes, my sister disregarding my feelings about what happened. That does hurt.
> 
> I am going to give her grace about this, as wedding planning is very stressful and overwhelming.

**OOP's thoughts on if Shady is trying to be the MOH due to taking over the shower as she claims to know the bride / sister than OOP does**

> **OOP:** I actually would have preferred Shady to take over the bachelorette party than the shower. With a little one at home I’ve gotten protective over my sleep, and I’m not into staying out all night as I used to be. But I will make it everything my sister wants and drink coffee or an energy drink or whatever I need to do to keep up with my sister and her friends.

**Is Shady a family member or related to anyone else in the family?**

> **OOP:** No.

She spent months saving her allowance to buy this specific, trendy jacket she really wanted. She was so proud of it.

Theres this girl in her class who is always making snarky comments about my daughter. This classmate actually told my daughter she wanted the jacket, but her parents wouldn't buy it for her.

Last week, my daughters jacket went missing from her locker during PE class. She came home crying. The classmate told the teacher she saw my daughter leave the jacket at the park, which was a total lie. The school said they couldnt do anything without proof.

Two days later, i was scrolling on facebook marketplace. I saw the exact same jacket listed for sale in our local town group. The seller? The classmates mom. i knew 100% it was my daughters bcoz i had sewn a tiny, hidden custom patch on the inside pocket and theres a embroidered personalize name of my daughter.

Instead of calling the school, i used my sisters facebook account to message the mom. I said i wanted to buy the jacket for her asking price in cash, and we agreed to meet at a busy local coffee shop.

When the mom showed up, she actually had her daughter (the classmate) with her. I walked right up to their table. I didnt scream, but i spoke loud enough for the people around us to hear. I said, wow, thanks so much for finding my daughters stolen jacket. I'll be taking that back now.

The classmate immediately started crying. Her mom turned bright red and started yelling that i was harassing them and that i was crazy. I calmly opened the jacket, showed the hidden patch to the barista and a few people watching, grabbed the jacket, and walked out.

Now the classmates mom is threatening to call the police on me for theft. The school counselor called me saying i traumatized the girl by publicly embarrassing her and that i should have handled it privately through the school. My husband thinks i went a little overboard and should have just told the principal. Am I the jerk?

TL;DR: My daughters classmate stole her expensive jacket, and the classmates mom tried to sell it online. I set up a fake buyer meetup, confronted them in public, and took it back. Now the school and the mom say i traumatized the kid.",340,1771736141.0,AmITheJerk,177,0.93,False

Nothing big like a summer storm; perhaps just a quick pelting on the rooftop of the cab, a drizzle on the pavement. Something to cool the air a bit, dampen the world burning around me. The drama of it all would be perfect for today. 

I told the cabman to take his time and let the ticker go once we arrived at the address. He knew the building when I told him. Go figure. Lots of guys like me talk to guys like him on the way to places like this. We’re a chatty bunch, really. And we love to tell our story. I hadn’t been to this spot in years, though I should have gone before now. Maybe if I had, then I wouldn’t have to today. 

It was hard to be back here. On the street, beneath the steps, just outside of the gate. It was harder to get off of the leather seat and onto the concrete. If I told him to keep going, he would, but maybe he’d judge me. Would he try to persuade me to go in? Is he one of us too? He looks gruff, maybe forty with a seven o’clock shadow. I smelled cigarette in the front somewhere- menthols. That unmistakable iced tea smell. 

Could I, I asked.

He held up a blue pack of the kind I smoked. Didn’t have to finish my sentence, didn’t need to. He knew. I traded him the pack for a fifty-dollar bill and told him to keep the change. He wished me luck and drove off without hesitation. I watched the ads on the back of the car turn to a blur, then it all was a yellow blur beneath the autumn trees down the way. My watch told me I was early. Early enough to cruise back up the street and hail another cab. Between me and the gate, I might’ve given it consideration. But my memory said the street the cabman went down is a one way that turns right, then right, then right again. Right back to the intersection of the downtown area I could hail a cab from.

He'd be disappointed if he saw me again. Furrow his unibrow, tell me to head back and go inside. His accent alone could sway me. He talked like a close friend. A brother. I did walk down the street, but only as far as the nearest park bench. The metal one I used to sit on all those years ago. I etched my name on the armrest with my zippo after my first full year. Carve out my legacy, leave my mark. I was so young.

Someone painted over it glossy black to match the fence behind it. I ran my fingers over where I thought I wrote it but I couldn’t feel it. Then I switched sides of the bench to feel the other arm- maybe I forgot. Damn the city for erasing it. It was a juvenile attachment. The sentiment still burns. 

I started to get some things back when I quit smoking. First thing was my sense of taste. Coffee smelled like coffee again. Cake was sweeter. I could smell cigarettes out in the wild and decipher what kind they were. Like a carcinogen sommelier. Then my breath came back. My nose wasn’t so stuffed and days like this were a charm. Even with the gasoline. September was crisp in my lungs like a juniper tree. I wasn’t fatigued, wasn’t coughing going up the stairs. No breaks during sex or panting like a mad dog after a run.

Finally, there was pocket space. No more box in my pants and no more losing my lighter. All I needed were my wallet and keys. No more awkward bulges on all sides. But It also meant I had no way to light the cigarette in my mouth.

Ten minutes went by, and across the street the light above the door went on. Yellow taxis driving by, dropping off and leaving. None waited like mine. More confidence. Regulars. A group formed by the gate and up came puffs of smoke. Men and women turned chimney, or a bunch of little chimneys. There was fire where smoke was. One of the guys would light me up. Or girls, if I was lucky. 

I moseyed across the street, walking like a stranger in a strange land. Slow and misguided, long swaying steps. I ached to bolt down the street and get picked up again. Surely my cabman was long gone. He’d probably picked up two people by then. City people. People not much different than me, just without the issue at hand.

The orange part of the cigarette was soaked on my lips. Ten more minutes and it'd disintegrate. Maybe I could just eat it up. It wouldn't be much different than a tin can of chew, I reckon. Just dryer. Take a bite of the stick, avoid talking to anyone, don't smoke for the first time in months. Run down the street and never look back. Get picked up by a different cabman with the same accent and head back home. Far, far away. 

The gate opened up and a few people huddled to the other side of it now, off of the street. A man in a black puffer jacket herded me through. I was slow to cross the threshold, and I hesitated to acknowledge where I was. 

Do you need a light? He bumped me with his elbow.

I nodded, and he lit my cigarette like they do in movies. Cupped hand around the flame, eye contact, a wink. That threw me off but I tried not to dwell on it. Narcissistic to think anything other than friendliness. I haven’t seen you here before. He pointed out, blowing smoke to his lapel.

I shook my head and kept smoking. I’d forgotten how much I like the dry air at the back of my throat. 

First time? He asked under his breath.

Newcomers don’t always like answering that question; not to strangers. I shook my head again. Just first time in a while.

Another elbow bumped me, this one smaller.  A short guy, maybe twenty years old. Hey man, he started, I hate to be this guy, but can I bum a cigarette?

He didn’t hate to be that guy. Nobody does. They hate the idea of getting rejected, but they don’t care either way about asking for something. The cigarette grabs hold of you and you can’t stop asking people for it. You got a cigarette? Can I go smoke? Did I bring my smokes? Where’s my lighter? 

I couldn’t go back to that, so I gave him the whole pack, minus one for the road. He looked like I was Santa. Thanked me over and over. Disappeared in a blink. Didn’t even ask my name. A woman opened the door on top of the stairs and people started filing upwards. One at a time, slowly. I smelled coffee wafting down the steps. The guy in the puffer vanished too. I didn’t think to ask his name. Nor him me. 

It was me alone. Me and the stairs. The last person shut the door but it didn’t lock. I stood facing the granite steps, one foot on the step, the other on the ground pointed at the fence. The bottom of the stairs weighed me down. All I had to do was climb. Climb them and go inside, grab a coffee, and listen. The sun set behind the buildings and I was left under the light of two yellow lampposts. Sucked the last drags of my cigarette. Coughed up some phlegm and spat it on the stairs. It was disrespectful. I clamoured up the first three and wiped my boot on the glob that rested on the fourth. The rest of the way up was easy. Well worn.

Inside, they began without me. I hustled past the main room to the kitchen and filled a styro cup up with the dregs of the coffee pot. The thicker stuff with all the soot. Then I shuffled to the room and found a seat next to the kid who’d asked me for a cigarette. He smiled when I sat down and thanked me again. I’d made it in time for introductions, and his name was Daniel. I don’t think they’d changed the setup since I was last here. The plastic chairs were just as squeaky as I left them, and the floor needed new tiles. Asbestos, probably. All new faces. Then it came turn for me to speak.

She came back with a tritan alpha. I wasn’t expecting much of a difference but the first few brews for sure raised my eyebrows. We did a blind side by side brew with the 02 Switch (glass) with same hario 01 filter/recipe/etc. It confirmed my first few cups: the alpha brewer has the highlighted acidity that the v60 is known for but results in a more balanced brew with sweetness and the needed bitterness to round out every brew.

My theory: it's less about increased flow (though it does brew about 10-15 seconds faster) and more about consistent filter fit and a more consistent water pathway through the coffee bed. Yes, the bottom opening is larger than the normal V60 but also the overall diameter is just wider. As a result, the 01 filter drops in perfectly, and once wetted, the pattern is always the same. Some of have said this is just vanity but compare this with the standard V60: the filter by default sits at an off angle and ""floats"" on certain ribs while sticking to other parts, seemingly random and different every time. On a clear sided v60 I always watch bypass just drip randomly down the walls- don't see that with the alpha. I haven’t given much thought to this over the years but my hypothesis is this is a factor in the v60’s inconsistencies.

These are just my initial impressions, but I am surprisingly impressed. I can get similar results with my Zp6/switch just not nearly as consistently. Especially with funky processes/naturals + zp6- I’ve had much better success with the alpha.

Lastly, if you mostly brew 1 cup (200-320ml) I think the 01 size is a better experience- the brewer sits lower, and the bed feels much more open/exposed and accessible to not only your kettle spout but your olfactory senses.",11,1771736014.0,pourover,0,0.92,False

I’m building [Incognear](https://incognear.com), a hyperlocal, ephemeral social app focused on what’s happening *around you right now*.

Key ideas:

* **Hyperlocal feed** → only see posts from nearby areas (100m to 3km)
* **Ephemeral posts** → everything expires (30 mins–24 hrs)
* **Live Log** → quick status updates with timestamp. 
* **Pseudo-anonymous** → no follower counts, no influencer nonsense

MVP is live and rough. Looking for 10–20 early testers who’ll roast it.

Biggest doubts: onboarding flow + location detection accuracy.

1rbcrk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyaleHigh_Roblox/comments/1rbcrk0/farming_tips_and_such_routine_of_a_level_11k/,Farming Tips And Such Routine of a Level 11k+ player.,"So I farmed for about 1 hour and 14 minutes just for this post. I started at level 11,177 levels and ended at 11,188 levels. Started at 1,771m diamonds and ended at 1,791m. So in the course of 74 minutes, I made 11 levels and 20k diamonds. I did it in campus 4. It's not my best since I was experiencing lag, plus was using a private server and wasn't able to do any journal tasks/ be voted. 

So here's my routine for campus 4 + my tips and little tricks. It's a long one. Plus some math at the end. 

Before school: You want to immediately start with getting your laundry in, and then go to the room behind you. Lotion, spray, wash hands, deodorant, pamper by window, royale duties. Once you've finished that area, your laundry should be ready to be put into the dryer. Don't worry if you don't make it to the washer before everyone else, just try to get it in before 3 minutes left. Then, I usually get a towel and get my tea. Get rid of the towel and while the tea is steeping, go to the hair dryer. I don't do any of the makeup stuff but I do keep some in my backpack for later. The only item i do from that area is the hair spray. There's a good chance your laundry will be done by then so go and get it if so. Then go the balcony behind the showers. Get a donut and get a coffee cup. If you haven't drank your tea yet you can alter between the donut and the tea and it'll go faster. Put the coffee cup in the machine and while it transitions to the screen, sit in one of the lounges. You CAN pick a coffee, but i press the x and put it back in my backpack. Then shower and do everything in there. Make sure you have an outfit saved for shower/school. By then you should have at most a few seconds before breakfast. 

Breakfast: Choose whatever you want, it all is the same. After you get your food, go sit and start to eat. If you're in a public server, give people roses. It'll give you more exp even if you don't get the most. Alter between each food and take a bite, making it all go faster. Turn your tray in and either do journal tasks, tidy textbooks or the stamping books. If you go tidy textbooks, try to get as high as possible but it's alright if you can't get 50+. Same goes with lunch. 

Starting with classes: English: English isn't too hard, just try your best and make an educated guess. If you can, you could use another device to look up/check auto correct for it to make sure you're right. The best advice i can give you for certain words is just memorize. So ""Appearance"", I usually look for ""app"" and ""ear"". ""Dessert"" has two s's so it's easier to remember. ""Argument"" is the shortest one of the choices. 

Computer: This also doesn't have much advice with it. I'm pretty sure it's the mobile players that don't really get to play it. If you can, I suggest trying to keep your eyes on the screen to see the next word coming up. If you struggle with typing, there's free games/programs online to help that. But if you're not that invested then whatever. 

Potionology: Again with little advice. Try to be quick and not tap on the wrong thing. It takes some effort so it's alright if you're not the best at this one. I'm not. If you have a choice between screen tapping or keyboard, just do the one you're more comfortable with. 

Study hall: I typically can get (when not distracted) like 14-15 correct in this class. It's just about quickness and memorizing. When the patterns become larger I say the colors of the cards in my head and repeat it as I'm tapping on the cards. Takes practice but it gets easier.

Fairy Flight: Make sure you have your wings on, you want to fly towards the waterfalls. There's a path of rings that will go upwards before you get to the little bridge thing. Follow it and continue to go upwards and the rings will veer to the right. Follow those. You should fly around some little islands and such. If you just keep up with it you'll get about 69-72 rings. 

Archery: I can typically get around 4k-5k points. I stick to the smaller section of targets, where there's no little houses or anything. Less going on, it's easier. You can tap MULTIPLE times on each target. Don't do a spam clicker, but if you can tap/click quickly, you could get like 300 off one target. I also aim for balloon but stop going after them if I miss more than 2/3 times. 

Basketball: This is going to be a little tricky to explain. I can typically make 13-17 baskets per class. You want to get your basketball and enter 1st pov (idk about mobile, I'm on a touch screen laptop). You want to stand in about the center of the larger box and using your curser you want to try and click on the closest cross section of net. That little white box right under the ring. Try to be between 0.2 and 0.3. 

Student Store: A personal favorite that I can usually get from 28-35 items in. This is all about memorizing. Try to keep the list in your line of sight as you run around. Try to stay moving when collecting items. Try to get all of the items in one area before going to the next. The 'Reusable Tote Bag's are by the front door and behind the counter. The glue, which some people struggle to find is next to the paint under the class textbooks. If you have any issues finding something just ask me. 

Swim: For the spinner, you really just want to try your best. Don't worry about when other people jump, just wait til it gets in the space between before jumping. The more you do it, the more you'll get a feel for it. For the baton race, try to time the bars so you can be flung by the last one. If you don't, it's okay. Go through the hoops and try to predict if it's going up, etc. Just remember to bring the baton back. And remember to shower, wash hands, etc. in the bathrooms after!

After class, you just do tasks, quests, etc. If you're in a private server, i'd honestly recommend just refreshing the server so you restart the day rather than having to wait like, what, 10 minutes(?) for the next day to start.

**The vibe**: this is a small town next to the sea and between small green mountains. It is calm, has almost no tourists, but at the same time there is a good balance between chilling and having fun for a couple of days.

**Transport:** taxis are quite expensive. Public transport doesn't exist (or I haven't seen any in 7 days). So be ready to rent a bike. It is cheap (150k/day) and easy, no deposit or other difficulties.

I rented here, and also recommend this guy to you:

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/xma9PPFZ4o5VaHuS9

Now you have a bike, so here's my suggestions on **what to do** in and out of the city:

1) Climb this hill to see a superb view of the sea and a temple.

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/xU5kHTe3GzuCTa239

2) Take a couple of photos in a sand dune, if you aren't from a desert region ofc 😅

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/kq9p1PtRcif9UTJh8

3) Have an hour of fresh air sitting on a bench next to the sea in this park

📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/F9trHxZSaCkb53Lo7

4) Visit a vietnamese cemetery

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/U2g3b5gHur7eYSoL8

5) Drive to the fishermen's village just to see a real life, grab some seafood

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqfaMZhpPK8Bnc1x8

6) Find this beautiful beach and spend a couple of hours chilling there. No people or shops in sight so have food and drinks with you

📍 https://goo.gl/maps/wAd4yivptHp812LA6

**Food:** it's hard to find european food there, even more – it's hard to find just a steak or grilled chicken there. Be ready to eat seafood all the time. If you're a coffee lover like me, I only have bad news – espresso is awful everywhere in Quy Nhon. I used to drink salted Vietnamese coffee, it was tasty. 

The only place I would recommend for food:

1) Super fresh, tasty and affordable seafood

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/RX5CvNahtGtk5yXP7

**Drinks:** it is still Vietnam so, of course, drinks are good almost everywhere.

1) I drank a lot of bubble tea at Mixue

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/J8RAbtdqZvYosSuh8

2) Sip a lemonade or something with a breathtaking sea view there 

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/ukKAUPGRtAXjqkQZA

3) Try a classic cocktail and check if you're still able to speak English 😂 with the bartender (he's English). There were also a couple of expats, so you could chat with someone

📍https://maps.app.goo.gl/dVx1vw9r3E9stwRS7

**Other tips and facts:**

1) The traffic is slow and insane at the same time. You'll need some time to adapt

2) The highlighted spot – Ky Co Beach – was closed. Idk if it's temporary or permanent but it's sad.

3) If you're looking for a hotel, I'd recommend this one:

https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEzyAugZjzjWRQx46

Super spacious rooms, cool view, good staff 

4) SPF!!! Especially if you're riding a bike

The story was too generic, the writing and dialogue weren’t engaging, and overall, it just didn’t work.

I’ve read countless short stories, and I’ve written quite a number of stories myself. Even though I’m not a professional writer, I do have my own quality standards, and they’re not low.

Then one day, I heard about automation and prompt engineering—about feeding your own writing into an AI and asking it to produce something that feels like your voice. Out of curiosity, I decided to give it a try.

I uploaded around ten of my previous short stories, along with detailed metadata and descriptions of my new story concept, into Gemini and asked it to study them. After it finished analyzing the material, I gave it a prompt and asked it to write a roughly 2,000-word short story.

Surprisingly, I found the result amazing and engaging. I posted it on Wattpad without mentioning that it was written with AI, just to see how readers would respond. So far, it has received around 20 reads, and no one has commented that it feels like it was written by AI.

That made me curious to hear what you would think about it.

Here’s the story:

The morning sun in Bandung was a liar. It streamed through the large Victorian windows of the Darkmoon Café, painting the wooden floorboards in warm, golden hues that promised a cheerful, ordinary day.

I blinked, refocusing on the table in front of me. Sitting across from me was Layla Zelda, my best friend since high school. She was tearing into a croissant with the same aggressive efficiency she used when hacking into secure servers. With her short, dark hair and a leather jacket she refused to take off even in the humidity, she looked ready for a fight, or a mosh pit.

""I'm not hallucinating,"" I defended, taking a sip of my coffee. ""I'm contemplating the narrative structure of my breakfast.""

""It's toast, Zen,"" Mikhail Deva mumbled from beside me, his mouth full. Mikha, our other childhood friend, was slouching in his chair, looking disheveled as usual. ""It doesn't have a narrative. Unless the bread is a metaphor for society crumbling.""

""Swallow before you speak, Mikha. You’re gross,"" Layla snapped, kicking him under the table.

""Ouch! Violence is the resort of the weak, Layla,"" Mikha retorted, rubbing his shin. He was the connector of our group—the guy who knew every thug, street vendor, and homeless person in the city, yet somehow couldn't tie his own shoelaces without drama.

""Violence is efficient,"" Sherryna’s voice drifted over from the counter.

Sherry was standing behind the espresso machine, not making coffee, but meticulously cleaning the steam wand with a cloth. She wore a simple white shirt today, her red curly hair tied back. She looked calm, almost domestic, but I knew better. The way she held the cloth was the same way she held a knife.

""See?"" Layla grinned, gesturing at Sherry. ""Sherry gets it.""

""Sherry is terrifying,"" Mikha whispered to me. ""I think she cleans that machine just to intimidate the beans.""

Via, the café’s manager and the only person who could bring warmth to this place, bustled out from the back carrying a tray of fresh pastries. ""Leave him alone, Layla. And Mikha, sit up straight. You’ll ruin your digestion.""

""Yes, Mom,"" Mikha grumbled, though he immediately sat up.

It was a peaceful scene. Too peaceful. The banter, the smell of butter and coffee, the sunlight—it felt like a scene from a slice-of-life novel.

Then, the heavy mahogany door swung open.

The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly. The sunlight seemed to dim.

Captain Addam Deshma stepped inside. He wasn't wearing his uniform, but the trench coat and the exhausted slump of his shoulders screamed 'police business.' He looked like he hadn't slept in forty-eight hours.

""Captain,"" Sherry said. She didn't look up, but her hands stopped moving on the machine. ""You're early. The misery usually doesn't roll in until after noon.""

""I wish it were just misery, Sherry,"" Addam said, his voice gravelly. He walked to the counter, ignoring the cheerful display of pastries Via offered him. He placed a thick, water-stained file folder on the wood. ""I have a nightmare. And I need you to wake me up.""

Layla and Mikha went silent. They knew the drill. When Addam showed up looking like that, it wasn't social.

""We should go,"" Layla said, grabbing her bag. She stood up, smacking Mikha on the shoulder. ""Come on, conspiracy boy. Let's go bother someone else.""

""But I haven't finished my—"" Mikha started.

""Now, Mikha,"" Layla ordered, dragging him up. She looked at me, her expression serious for a split second. ""Text us if you need... you know. The usual.""

""I will,"" I promised.

As the door clicked shut behind them, the warmth of the morning vanished completely.

""So, how was it, Captain?"" Sherry asked, putting down her tools. Her demeanor shifted instantly from bored mechanic to alert predator. ""You look like you’ve seen a ghost.""

 

""Worse, Sherry,"" Addam said, his voice gravelly. He walked to the counter and placed a thick, water-stained file folder on the polished wood. ""I’ve seen an angel. A dead one.""

I slid off my stool and approached. ""Homicide?""

""That’s the technical term,"" Addam said, sliding onto the stool next to me. ""But my forensics team is calling it 'biblical.' And my superiors are calling it a 'closed case' to avoid a panic. I need you two. Tonight.""

Sherry flipped the folder open. I leaned in, expecting the usual gruesome crime scene photos.

What I saw made my breath hitch.

The photo showed a woman lying on the pavement of a back alley. She was young, incredibly beautiful, with skin as pale as marble. But her body was broken, twisted at unnatural angles.

""Thrown?"" Sherry asked, her eyes scanning the image.

""Dropped,"" Addam corrected. ""From the roof of the Merdeka Tower. Forty stories.""

""Suicide?"" I asked.

""Turn the page,"" Addam commanded.

The next photo was a close-up of the woman's back. The skin was torn, raw and bloody. Two massive, jagged scars ran diagonally across her shoulder blades, parallel to each other. It looked as if something had been violently ripped out of her flesh.

""Forensics says the tissue trauma indicates a massive tensile load before the tear,"" Addam said. ""Whatever was attached to her back... it wasn't glued on. It was anchored to the skeletal structure.""

Sherry flipped to the next photo. It showed the victim's ankles and hips. On each point, there was a tattoo—a stylized, intricate wing.

""We found three of them in the last two weeks,"" Addam said, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""All different women. All stunningly beautiful. All found at the base of high-rise buildings. And all of them have these scars. And the tattoos.""

""Who are they?"" Sherry asked.

""That's the problem,"" Addam sighed, rubbing his temples. ""They're nobody. No IDs. No wallet. No phone. We ran fingerprints, facial recognition, dental records. Nothing. It’s like they didn’t exist until they hit the pavement.""

""And the DNA?"" I asked.

""Inconclusive,"" Addam said. ""The lab techs are baffled. They say the markers are... too clean. Too perfect. Like there’s no variance.""

Sherry pulled a small plastic evidence bag from the back of the folder. Inside lay a single, white feather. It was long, pristine, and shimmered with a faint, iridescent sheen under the café lights.

""We found these at every scene,"" Addam said. ""Scattered around the bodies like confetti.""

I stared at the feather. ""So, we have beautiful, unidentified women falling from the sky, with scars where wings used to be, and feathers at the scene.""

""The Angel Hunter,"" I whispered, the title writing itself in my head. ""Someone is hunting angels, ripping off their wings, and dropping them.""

Sherry picked up the bag, holding the feather up to the light. She wasn't looking at the beauty of it. She was looking for the flaw.

""Angels don't bleed, Zenko,"" she said coldly. ""And they certainly don't have forensic evidence.""

She tossed the bag back onto the folder.

""This isn't theology,"" Sherry stated, her eyes narrowing into dangerous slits. ""It's manufacturing.""

 

**II. THE HOLLOW BONES**

We followed Addam to the central morgue. The transition from the warm café to the sterile, cold room was jarring. Dr. Hady, the coroner, looked pale as he pulled back the sheet.

The victim was stunningly beautiful. Symmetrical features, flawless skin. But it was the damage to her back that drew the eye.

""Tell them about the bones, Doctor,"" Sherry ordered, snapping on a pair of latex gloves.

""Y-yes,"" Dr. Hady stammered. ""When we did the X-rays to check for impact trauma... her bones. They aren't solid.""

""Osteoporosis?"" I asked.

""No,"" Sherry answered before the doctor could. She ran a finger along the victim's collarbone. ""Avian structure. Honeycombed. Pneumatized bones.""

""Exactly,"" Dr. Hady nodded, sweating. ""Incredibly light, yet reinforced. Like she was built to fly.""

Sherry moved to the back, inspecting the horrific wounds on the shoulder blades. She probed the tissue with a forcep. ""Surgically grafted sockets fused to the scapula. Whatever was attached here bore significant weight.""

""Wings,"" I said, the word heavy in the cold air.

Sherry pulled a small plastic evidence bag from the file Addam had brought. Inside was a single, white feather. She pulled a lighter from her pocket and held a flame to the tip.

It melted, smelling of burning plastic.

""Synthetic polymer weave,"" Sherry stated. ""Textured to look organic, but heat-resistant and aerodynamic.""

She looked at Addam. ""These aren't angels, Captain. They are gliders. Pilots. And the lack of ID?""

""Nothing,"" Addam confirmed. ""Fingerprints, DNA, dental... she doesn't exist.""

""She wasn't born, she was grown,"" Sherry said, her eyes narrowing. ""Genetic blanks. Vessels designed for a specific purpose: Flight. Stealth insertion. But look at the legs.""

She pointed to the muscle atrophy in the victim's calves. ""She can fly, but she can't walk for long. A specialized tool.""

""So the 'Angel Hunter' isn't a serial killer,"" Addam realized. ""It's a disposal crew.""

""They aren't taking trophies,"" Sherry said grimly. ""They are recovering the hardware. The wings are the expensive tech. The girls... they are just the packaging.""

 

**III. THE EYRIE**

""We need a launch point,"" Sherry said as we drove through the city. ""Gliders need altitude.""

I pulled up the city map. ""The 'Skyline Zenith' project. Abandoned skyscraper construction on the northern ridge. Highest point in the city.""

""Owned by a shell company,"" Sherry noted, checking her tablet. ""Standard procedure for you-know-who.""

*Aetherian Mass Systems.*

We infiltrated the Zenith building an hour later. It was a skeleton of steel and concrete, wind whistling through the girders. We climbed forty flights of stairs in silence.

As we neared the roof, we heard it. *Whoosh. Click.*

We cracked the roof door open.

In the center of the windswept roof, a mobile high-tech lab had been set up. Floodlights cut through the gloom. And there, standing on the edge of the precipice, was a woman.

She was naked, her back to us. Protruding from her shoulder blades were massive, magnificent white wings. They spanned three meters, articulating with mechanical precision.

""Subject 7, launch,"" a voice commanded over a speaker.

She stepped off.

I gasped, rushing to the parapet. She swooped down, caught an updraft, and rose silently into the night sky. It was breathtaking.

But then, a spark. A mechanical failure.

She tumbled, crashing onto the lower terrace three floors down.

""Recovery Team, move in,"" the voice barked. ""Detach the unit. Discard the chassis.""

Two men in black tactical gear emerged on the lower terrace, carrying power tools. A circular saw revved to life.

""They're going to harvest her,"" I said, gripping my *bokken*.

""Not tonight,"" Sherry snarled.

 

**IV. THE FALLEN**

Sherry vaulted over the railing, sliding down a construction chute. I followed.

The men reached the fallen Angel. She was moaning, alive. One man raised the saw.

I lunged. My kendo training took over. I ducked under the saw's swing and brought my *bokken* down on his wrist. *Crack.* He dropped the tool.

Sherry engaged the second man, disarming him with a brutal Krav Maga takedown.

We stood over the Angel. Up close, her eyes were void of understanding. The wings were bolted into her flesh, metal ports oozing clear fluid.

""Help... me..."" she rasped.

Suddenly, the door to the upper roof burst open. Six more guards poured out, led by a man in a white coat.

""Subject 7 is 80% avian DNA, 20% synthetic structure,"" the scientist sneered from the balcony. ""She is a drone. Save the wings. Neutralize the intruders.""

The tactical team raised their weapons. We were trapped.

""Zenko,"" Sherry said calmly. ""Can you fly?""

""What?""

""Grab her left side. The aerofoils are intact.""

""That's suicide!""

""Staying here is execution. Now!""

We grabbed the Angel by her arms and ran for the edge. Bullets pinged off the concrete. We leaped into the void.

For a terrifying second, we fell. Then Sherry yanked the manual release cord on the harness.

*SNAP.*

The wings locked open. We jerked upward, the wind catching the synthetic feathers. We weren't flying, but we were gliding.

""Steer her!"" Sherry yelled.

We banked right, soaring over the city lights, descending rapidly toward the dark expanse of a city park. We crashed through the tree line, branches whipping our faces, and landed in a soft patch of mud.

Sherry immediately cut the harness. The Angel lay still, breathing.

""We survived,"" Sherry said, looking back at the looming tower. ""But the factory is still up there.""

 

**V. THE GRAVITY OF TRUTH**

The aftermath was messy. Addam arrived with a tactical team to secure the park, but the lab at the Zenith was already gone. Scrubbed clean.

""They don't leave crumbs,"" Sherry said, sipping coffee in the back of an ambulance.

""We have Subject 7,"" Addam said. ""She's stable. My doctors say the grafting is irreversible, but she can live. The wings had to be amputated.""

""She'll never fly again,"" I said.

""She was never meant to land, Zenko,"" Sherry replied. ""Grounding her is the only way to save her.""

Addam sighed. ""I can't put 'manufactured angels' in the report.""

""Call it a trafficking ring,"" Sherry suggested. ""Illegal surgical experiments.""

""And the Angel?"" Addam asked.

""Give her a name,"" I said. ""Sarah.""

""Sarah,"" Addam agreed. ""We'll put her in witness protection. Somewhere ground level.""

 

**VI. THE FEATHERED CAGE**

A week later, the rhythm of Darkmoon Café had returned to normal. Or as normal as it ever got.

It was late afternoon. The sun was setting, casting long, orange shadows across the floor. Layla and Mikha were back at our usual table. Layla was typing furiously on her laptop, while Mikha was trying to balance a spoon on his nose.

""So,"" Layla said, not looking up from her screen. ""I heard a rumor. Police raid on the north ridge. Something about a trafficking ring?""

""You hear a lot of things, Layla,"" I said, stirring my tea. I was working on my write-up of the case. I titled it *Angel Hunter*.

""And I heard,"" Mikha added, the spoon clattering to the table, ""that someone saw a giant bird crash into the city park. Or maybe a drone. Or Mothman.""

""It was a drone,"" I lied effortlessly. ""Police surveillance drone. Malfunctioned.""

Sherry walked over, placing a fresh round of drinks on the table. She looked at Mikha. ""Mothman has better things to do than visit Bandung, Mikha.""

She glanced at my notebook. ""Done with the fiction?""

""Almost,"" I said.

""Good."" She walked back to the counter, picking up the radio transmitter she was always tinkering with.

Layla stopped typing and looked at me. Her eyes were sharp, intelligent. She knew I was lying. She knew there was more to the story than drones and trafficking. But she didn't push.

""Well,"" Layla said, closing her laptop. ""Whatever it was, I'm glad you didn't break any bones this time, Zen. You're running out of spare parts.""

""I'm durable,"" I grinned.

""You're lucky,"" Mikha corrected.

As they bickered, I looked over at Sherry. She was staring out the window at the darkening sky. The case was closed. Sarah was safe. But the organization that built her—Aetherian Mass Systems—was still out there.

They were building angels in the attic of our city. And I had a feeling that next time, they wouldn't just be learning how to fly.

They'd be learning how to hunt.

I closed my notebook. ""Who wants dinner? My treat.""

""Pizza,"" Mikha shouted.

""Pizza,"" Layla agreed.

Sherry turned off the lights in the back, the neon sign of the café buzzing to life against the twilight.

""Don't stay out too late, kids,"" she said, a faint, unreadable smile on her lips. ""The monsters come out at night.""

We laughed, stepping out into the cool evening air, leaving the ghosts of the angels behind us, at least for tonight.
