1fw5sur,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fw5sur/restraining_order/,Restraining Order,"This is basically just a vent. My ex girlfriend (21 F) and I (25 M) broke up at the beginning of May. We were absolute best friends, we lived in her truck for a month just camping in the desert and mountains and driving around the U.S. and didn't get sick of each other one time. Neither one of us had ever experienced chemistry like this before. She said multiple times how safe she felt with me and that I'm the only man she's ever trusted/loved. 

The only reason we broke up was cause she was moving for the summer for a job. I wanted to just do long distance for that 4 months, but I respected her decision. We talked many times over the summer via text, and there were a lot of 'I miss you' from both sides, and she even went so far as to say that we never should have left the desert, and there's a universe where we didn't. She said multiple times that she truly believes our paths will cross again someday during our separate travels on the road.

Fast forward, she's back in our town for her college schooling. Apparently, she saw me 3 times in public. I did see her once at a coffee shop and I decided to not acknowledge her obviously. She has since filed a restraining order against me. I'm absolutely heartbroken - she's seen me around town cause my apartment is 1/2 a block from her work place, 2 blocks from the coffee shop, and about 20 feet from her college. She even parked directly in front of my front door and when I later parked near her to go into my apartment, she claimed in her petition that she's certain I parked there to scare her.

I'm lost and so depressed. I never pictured our story ending in front of a judge in a courtroom. It's such an ugly situation. I don't know why we couldn't have been adults and just moved forward. 

What's worse is that my reputation is completely tarnished in my town because most people are going to believe the cute, 5'3"" girl over the huge 6'4"" guy that has an alcoholic problem. I never thought she'd stoop to this level. Fortunately she has no ev8dence so hopefully it won't be granted (not because I want to be around her, but because I don't want to be arrested for being in public if she happens to see me).",1,1728065501.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

( To make it REALLY clear : I am interested in hacked/modded GAMES )

And there is always a problem with the IPA. Here are the errors i encountered:

1. The IPA shown on the website is nothing like the app .......... ( I downloaded a Spiderman game, and was instead given a Spiderman themed Subway surfers rip-off ).
2. The app is installed successfully, but requires a payment/subscription to ""activate the mod"" ....... ( IOSGods wont let you use their apps withoutpaying for a VIP account ). 
3. The app is from so long ago, they don't run anymore,  and require you to update the app - which just redirects me to the App Store to download the legitimate game ......... ( A Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery IPA I installed refused to let me play until I ""upgraded"" the game to the latest version ). 
4. Some apps are installed successfully, are free, and aren't old, so they run fine. Until about 5 minutes into the game, where the app will crash and force exit at a specific checkpoint ....... ( In another Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery IPA I installed, from Telegram - as I couldn't find a free working IPA on my browser, the game was relatively new, free and worked. Until after the first 5 minutes of the game, where the app would, almost on purpose, continuously crash and exit the app the moment I finished the first task of the game; learning the Lumos charm ).

If you read allat, Thank you ( Sincerely ) üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .

I hope anyone is willing to share any free, still-running, modded games, because I can't, for the love of me, find even one!

1fw5qxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adjuncts/comments/1fw5qxp/adjunct_faculty_position_at_overworked_u_ou/,Adjunct Faculty Position at Overworked U (OU),"Are you passionate about education but allergic to financial stability? Do you love teaching but hate benefits, job security, and basic respect? Then *Overworked University* (OU) has the perfect adjunct position for you! We're looking for an **Adjunct Faculty** member‚Äîsomeone who can handle the heavy lifting of teaching without any of the pesky perks that come with a full-time job.

**About Us:** At *Overworked U*, we pride ourselves on our ability to stretch every dollar to its breaking point‚Äîespecially when it comes to paying adjuncts. Our mission? To keep the wheels of higher education spinning on the backs of underpaid, overqualified faculty. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to make a difference without making a livable wage, you‚Äôve found it! Plus, you‚Äôll get to experience the joy of working on a contract that lasts as long as a carton of milk.

**The Role: Adjunct Faculty Extraordinaire** We‚Äôre looking for someone with a passion for teaching and the ability to work for less than a Starbucks barista. You‚Äôll be doing *everything* a full professor does, minus the benefits, tenure, or office space (you didn‚Äôt need one, right?). Here‚Äôs what a *typical day* will look like:

* **Teaching Powerhouse:** You'll teach up to six courses per semester, including ones you‚Äôve never heard of until two days before classes start. We‚Äôll send you the textbook (or not) and expect you to hit the ground running. Syllabi? Create one on the fly!
* **Office-Hour Ninja:** You‚Äôll hold office hours at the campus caf√© or in the hallway because we don‚Äôt have an office for you. No biggie, right? Students will email you constantly anyway, but good luck finding Wi-Fi on campus that works.
* **Invisible Contributor:** Attend faculty meetings‚Ä¶ or don‚Äôt, because you won‚Äôt be invited. You might even forget you're technically a faculty member until payday comes around and you wonder if they lost your direct deposit info again.
* **Jack of All Subjects:** You‚Äôll teach courses outside your specialty‚Äîbecause who cares if you have a PhD in English? You‚Äôre now also qualified to teach Intro to Marketing, Advanced AI, and Basket Weaving 101.
* **Assessment Machine:** Grade 200+ assignments in under a week, and give detailed feedback that students will promptly ignore. But don‚Äôt worry! You can grade from anywhere, like at your other job(s) you‚Äôll need to survive.

**Qualifications:** We‚Äôre not picky‚Äîjust kidding, we‚Äôre extremely picky. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for in our next adjunct superhero:

* **PhD (or equivalent suffering) in your field**‚Äîor honestly, in any field, as long as you can convince us you can teach whatever we need.
* **Teaching experience:** 10+ years is ideal, but if you can fog a mirror and work a projector, you‚Äôre hired.
* **Flexibility:** Be prepared to teach early mornings, late nights, weekends, and the occasional midnight Zoom class, all for the price of a month‚Äôs rent in 1980.
* **Tech-savvy wizardry:** You‚Äôll be required to use our outdated learning management system, troubleshoot your own tech problems, and still find time to design an engaging, interactive course. Oh, and don‚Äôt expect anyone to train you on this.
* **Emotional resilience:** You must smile while being mistaken for a TA, ignored by tenured faculty, and asked, ‚ÄúSo, when will you get a *real* job?‚Äù

**What We Offer:** You didn‚Äôt go into academia for the money, did you? Good! Because here at *Overworked U*, we have *lots* to offer, none of which involve financial security:

* **Competitive Pay:** And by competitive, we mean you‚Äôll be competing with yourself to see how many classes you need to teach just to cover your rent.
* **No Benefits:** You didn‚Äôt want health insurance or retirement, did you? Good news! You won‚Äôt get any. Your wellness package is surviving on coffee and the adrenaline of grading 50 papers in one night.
* **Semester-to-Semester Employment:** If we like you (and if we remember to rehire you), you *might* be invited back next semester! No promises, though. You‚Äôll hear from us at the last minute.
* **Exposure to University Culture:** You‚Äôll be a valued member of the academic community... except for the part where you‚Äôre excluded from all decision-making processes, departmental votes, and full-time faculty perks.
* **No Office, No Problem:** Who needs an office? Work from your car, the campus quad, or that one chair in the library no one sits in. You‚Äôll get creative.
* **Work-Life‚Ä¶ Integration?** We believe in *ultimate* flexibility. You‚Äôll have so much free time between your multiple gigs that work and life will blur into one chaotic, sleepless existence. It‚Äôs not balance, but it‚Äôs something!

**Interview Process:** Our interview process is as rigorous as our salary. Here‚Äôs what to expect:

* **Quick phone screen:** We‚Äôll call you at an inconvenient time to make sure you can talk about your teaching philosophy while driving or grocery shopping.
* **Teaching demo:** You‚Äôll give a lecture in a classroom that hasn‚Äôt been updated since 1992. Half the students won‚Äôt show up, but we‚Äôll still expect you to bring your A-game.
* **Final round:** A 10-minute Zoom call where we‚Äôll ask, ‚ÄúHow fast can you start?‚Äù before ghosting you for a few weeks.

If you're ready to change the world one underpaid class at a time, join us at *Overworked U*! It‚Äôs not a career‚Äîit‚Äôs an endless adjunct adventure where your passion for education is the only thing keeping you going. Apply today! If we remember to check the applications, we might just get back to you.",2,1728065366.0,Adjuncts,0,1.0,False

We had a lot of issues in our relationship plus it became 3 hours long distance on top of that and so it wasn‚Äôt working out. It was a mutual breakup.

We were no contact for a while but for the past month he started messaging me asking me how I‚Äôve been doing. I decided to meet up with him a couple weeks ago when he was in town to visit and we caught up a bit over some coffee. It wasn‚Äôt too bad. 

Then he asked me to come stay with him next weekend just as friends because there‚Äôs a lot of things he wants to show me in his new city. He insisted that he can come to my city (which is 3 hours away from his) and drive me to his city. 

To me this is crossing a line. I don‚Äôt want to stay at his place for a whole weekend where he could easily try to make a move. I tried to explain this to him but he kept insisting that he‚Äôs not trying to get back together, he just wants to spend some time together and show me around because he misses my company. 

I finally told him over the phone kind of angrily that it was a no and he got upset and he hasn‚Äôt messaged me for about a week now. I feel a bit bad for talking to him rudely but I tried to explain multiple times that I‚Äôm not comfortable with weekend trips and he just brushed me off.

I'm 16, and frankly just ready to get out of here and go to college. I'm tired of the random audits on my phone at 2 in the morning, I'm tired of her yelling at me because I have a different opinion than her, or because I don't want to do something that apparently is gonna benefit me. This is not to say she doesn't support me, but she supports too much, and if I ever try to bring that up she just says ""well then I'll stop caring all together"" which is not what I want.

I even had a girlfriend once, but for some reason my mom hated her guts, and I had to hide this relationship so much to the point where it got so exhausting I had to break up with her.

It's not like she's a bad mother at all, I just feel like she's doing too much. She spends time with me, she helps me with my goals, she cooks for me, she takes me to do activities that take time out of her day, she takes me to work and a bunch of other shit that I could go on about.

If she sees something beneficial that I should do, that I don't agree with, she will get upset that I don't want to do something that is for me, and take my electronics and give me an attitude until I apologize. For example, I was really into guitar a few years ago, and we were at a coffee shop with live music. She said I should go up and go talk to the musicians, but at that time I was really struggling with my social anxiety, so I declined her offer. After that, she got frustrated and acted like I just cursed her out or something.

  
She made me sign up for this coding website that I hated, and struggled to learn from. After we finally cancelled it she just said ""Well we tried and now we know that you don't like it"" even though I told her numerous times before we signed up that I don't like programming and don't want to learn about it. (that has changed now though I have found an interest in computer programming not because she forced me to but because I found an interest on my OWN.)

Her excuse for any of this is ""I'm your number 1 cheerleader, I wanna see you succeed, I wanna protect you. When I try to do something beneficial for you, you always spit in my face.""

  
I'm frankly just annoyed with her. I'm tired of feeling like I'm being watched over, I'm tired of feeling like she's trying to protect me from everything, I'm tired of feeling bad when I disagree with her, I'm tired of not being able to love who I want to love, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm trying to be shaped into her ""baby boy"" instead of the future man I want to be.

TL;DR: Should I be thankful that my mom cares about me so much that she gets mad when I don't recognize it? Or does she need to back off a bit and let me be a kid?",1,1728064972.0,family,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre all students. I‚Äôm a quiet person and don‚Äôt often invite friends over. However, one of my roommates does that quite frequently. I don‚Äôt mind her having guests as long as they behave normally.

Today, I came back from work, and in the kitchen (which is literally right next to my room), my roommate and her five friends were there, and they were being so loud that I couldn‚Äôt even watch YouTube in my room because their conversations were drowning out the video I was watching. So, I decided to go ask them if they could move to her room and continue their conversations there with the door closed. I was expecting a response like ‚Äúsure,‚Äù assuming it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

However, my roommate gave me a nasty look and started telling me that it‚Äôs early (it was around 6 pm) and that they were just having coffee. But what was I supposed to do? Sit in my room and not be able to relax just because it wasn‚Äôt nighttime yet?

In the end, they went to her room, but both my roommate and her friends started making fun of me. They said things like, ‚ÄúOh, I better make sure to pee quietly,‚Äù and were snickering at me as if I had done something wrong. Then, I overheard them talking about me in her room.

I thought my roommate would understand since we had a conversation before where she asked me and my friends to be quieter because she didn‚Äôt want to hear loud laughter from my room when she was trying to watch a movie. I accepted that and since then, I‚Äôve been more mindful, and I usually meet my friends outside.

The number one thing I hate about my family (they are very toxic) is that they want to blame all my upsets on me just being hormonal because I'm pregnant. It's really invalidating. 

Back Story:
So back in November I had suffered SA and had found out shortly after that I was pregnant. My partner was very supportive and was willing to claim the baby whether it was his or not. At that time we were in a polyamorous relationship (he had another partner). My dad who is very conservative Christian disagreed with that. We were living together and both paying the bills for the place. So after telling my partner about the pregnancy which I hadn't told my dad about yet we were going to go do something to cheer me up. As we were leaving my dad decided to make a negative comment about my partner and basically forbid me from seeing him anymore. I'm 31 years old and paying bills. I felt this was very rude because he should have waited till after my partner left and saying he doesn't want him in our shared living space is fine but outright saying I can't date him is not. Obviously it sparked a fight where me being pregnant came up among many other long pushed down issues with my family. My dad ended up throwing us out. Unfortunately, this led to my partner having to tell his other partner I was pregnant and even though I told him it was likely the baby wasn't his he told them it was which ended their relationship. I ended up miscarriage and when I did my dad reached out to ask me if I was ready to stop being crazy and leave him and move back in now that I wasn't pregnant and too hormonal to be rational. Obviously I refused and am still living with my partner and his family.

In February I found out I was pregnant with my partner which was unexpected. He's been the best through the whole pregnancy. But every time my dad randomly sends me something like ""Good Morning, (random insult directed at me or my partner)"" via text or anything similar or my mother decides to start going off about something that she doesn't have a say in and I place the boundary down they are just like well I guess I won't talk to you till you have the baby since you are too pregnant and hormonal to be reasonable. 

This upsets me for a couple reasons. Yes I'm pregnant and yes that makes me hormonal but that's not why I'm upset. If you are being a jerk to me, my partner, or my kids I'm gonna be upset whether I'm pregnant or not. You attacking my son for what he's wearing or yelling at my partner for not letting my 4 year old have coffee is going to make me upset. Hormones have nothing to do with it. Honestly, I don't even really feel like hormones have anything to do with how I feel lately. I have been running on 3 to 4 hours sleep every night for weeks because my older boys have night terrors, I have a cat who likes to wake me up, the baby won't stop hitting my bladder, those practice contractions, etc. I am also financially stressed because my partner has been working longer hours to barely get us by and we are still behind. And im so tired of being expected to function from 8 AM to 1 AM because my partners working and I have to stay up later so when I go back to work I'm not exhausted since I work nights and ofte. Don't get off till 4 AM and will be getting even less sleep. Another problem might be that this job I have gives me a sense of dread on like a deep soul level so I don't really want to go back.",1,1728064857.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

We had a lot of issues in our relationship plus it became 3 hours long distance on top of that and so it wasn‚Äôt working out. It was a mutual breakup.

We were no contact for a while but for the past month he started messaging me asking me how I‚Äôve been doing. I decided to meet up with him a couple weeks ago when he was in town to visit and we caught up a bit over some coffee. It wasn‚Äôt too bad. 

Then he asked me to come stay with him next weekend just as friends because there‚Äôs a lot of things he wants to show me in his new city. He insisted that he can come to my city (which is 3 hours away from his) and drive me to his city. 

To me this is crossing a line. I don‚Äôt want to stay at his place for a whole weekend where he could easily try to make a move. I tried to explain this to him but he kept insisting that he‚Äôs not trying to get back together, he just wants to spend some time together and show me around because he misses my company. 

I finally told him over the phone kind of angrily that it was a no and he got upset and he hasn‚Äôt messaged me for about a week now. I feel a bit bad for talking to him rudely but I tried to explain multiple times that I‚Äôm not comfortable with weekend trips and he just brushed me off.

Extremely honest, wholesome, and admirable guy. Rarely has he ever done anything to rock the boat or be malicious. We've been together for about a year. 

I find myself blowing up indiscriminately at him for minor things. When I say ""blowing up"" I mean losing my mind over text and calling him over and over again and begging for him to engage in pointless, circular conversation about the minor thing that bothered me. 

Some examples of things that have sparked extensive, bitter fighting by me:
- I suggested a trip to Colorado in the winter and he said we need to do it in the summer 
- His tone or manner was slightly off and I went off the rails demanding to know why he's mad at me and continuing to ask once he claims he's not mad
- He lost service and didn't text me while in the mountains
- When I surface sensitive topics he won't answer immediately and claims to need time to think or want to talk in person (I hate this and it feels like stonewalling and avoiding me)
- When he only calls me for 5 minutes or so and then says he has to go

Many more examples. I have tried so many things to sedate the demon inside me - birth control and hormone management, talk therapy, SSRIs, herbal remedies, and more. Talk therapy seemed to worsen my problems and make me even more sensitive. For more context we are mid-distance (I'm in the city and he is in the suburbs) and I have significantly more relationship and sexual experience than him (I've had multiple boyfriends in my 20s and sexual partners, he is a virgin who has never dated anyone). Am I just traumatized from bad men in the past and I'm unfixable?

I feel like a helpless freak at times. The other day, I saw a couple at the coffee shop smiling and sharing a coffee together and I felt so envious and angry. I've been so close to a happy healthy relationship so many times with him but I can't stop fucking up.

I want to stop, but I can't. I feel like I genuinely CANNOT stop. When I get into these fighting moods, everything else in my life goes to shit.

I have suffered with PCS following a downhill bike crash in January 2019. My symptoms for the first 4 months were acute and significant - but gradually improved after a few months of vestibular rehab. Since August 2019, I have dealt with daily headaches - most commonly triggered through exercise, screens, and stress. I have tried a variety of recovery techniques with varying commitment and few positive results: doctors, neurologists, physiotherapy, chiropractor, nutritionist, myofascial release, RMT, diet changes, no alcohol, optometrist, vestibular therapy, acupuncture, university research studies, controlled cardio training, buffalo treadmill test - the list really goes on. It is worth noting that my discipline has varied with each strategy. I am a 30 year old and have done my best to not let my headaches control my life. Have I spent too many hours at my computer screen at work? Yes. Have I pushed it too far at at the gym? Yes. Have I had a too many drinks on the weekend? Yes. A few transparent examples of the reality of recovery and the guilt that can come with it. I was/am far from a perfect recovery patient. My commitment to the recovery process ebbed and flowed over the last 5 years. The headaches were always there - but the complexity and the unknowns of recovery certainly led do doubt, and ultimately impacted my levels of hope.

  
I recently went out for an unplanned 50 km bike ride with a buddy. Per the norm - I was expecting my headache to be more significant over next 2-3 days. It wasn't. That was my first 'green' flag. Then I went for a high-paced 5 km run a few days later - minimal impact.  It was clear something had changed. Over the last two months I have had minimal headaches. My exercise intolerance is manageable, my screen sensitivity is near normal - and of course my moral is boosted. After 5 years I had accepted the fact that the headaches and restrictions were my new normal. Even the neurologist supported this conclusion. But it wasn't. I feel confident I am now on my way to full recovery.   
  
What cased the improvement after 5 years? I would love to know that answer. Here are my current theories in descending theoretical relevance:  


1. Morning Protein with Greens - I started taking \~40 g of protein powder w/ greens as soon as I woke up (pre-coffee) with about 150 g of blueberries. I started this to help improve digestive issues I was having. Maybe it is reducing inflammation? Not sure.

2. Cardio Training - Over the summer I have been doing a lot of biking (average 5-10 km per day) and some light body weight exercises. In the past i had explored heart rate and cardio training with a stationary bike - but always ended up hitting an upper limit and aggravating my symptoms. That said, I could've mixed in the right amount of cardio, rest, and stretching to push through that exercise intolerance. 

3. Vestibular 'Stretching' - i am not obviously not qualified to talk about this (hah), but i always felt that there was a direct connection between my eyes and headaches. I brought this theory to many optometrists and they all concluded my vision was fine. When my headaches were bad, I could find relief by looking straight up/down/sideways with a little bit of force (?). It felt like it was stretching the muscles behind my eyes that were tight/sore. Over the past few months I've been trying to complete this rudimentary stretch and there doesn't appear to be as much tightness and sensitivity. 

4. RMT and Chiropractor - I have been seeing chiro and RMT over the last 4 years. I recently had a significant session with the chiro (following an RMT session to loosen my neck and shoulders) which certainly seemed to provide some relief. I had similar treatments in the past - which leads me to believe this wasn't the acute cause. But these two practitioners certainly provided some level of relief and improvement. My chiropractor was comfortable adjusting my upper neck - which I felt was vital.

  
Please take any info that I've listed as circumstantial. I am certainly not an expert on any of this. It's just my experience. I thought it was worth sharing what little info I have, as there is power in a random success story. 

Keep hope! There is improvement out there. Keep trying recovery strategies and don't lose hope. Commitment and discipline is important - but please don't let yourself be weighed down by the guilt. It's not your fault.

1fw51fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1fw51fp/more_advice_sought_on_effort_dates_instead_of_low/,More advice sought on effort dates (instead of low effort),"I have been a lurker for quite a while. Very eye-opening stuff. Had I read this page (and had it existed) years ago, I would have been able to dodge so much. 

I want to share how something horrific that was done by a man to me started (not the rest for now or maybe ever): the first date. Just so we are crystal clear: in my own case, there were already red flags on his profile, but I would have never in a million years understood them as such at the time. There were also some in our communication, I recognized only one. For obvious reasons (1. there is nothing in the market; it's dead. 2. vulnerability overall, but even worse at this point- this was already at a low point in my life. 3. there is nothing I want more than companionship and love... well other than my physical and emotional safety, of course) 4. All my friends and acquaintances, male and female, even acquaintances I would not deem attractive inside or out, had found someone perfect for them. I like myself and had hope that someone else would - bullocks of course, because the world ain't fair; 4. I can never make up in salary what paying half rent, half hotel bills etc would bring in. 5. extremely important: no knowledge of financial and romance scams, how psychopathy/narcissistic personality disorders and men in general overall function. 6. societal brainwashing that we need to give men ""a chance"" and or can mold them. Yada yada, etc), I ignored the one potential red flag I could identify. 

Now on to the first date: he asked me about my preferences regarding diet and general location and then booked an expensive restaurant table. He paid and did not ask me to contribute. I felt embarrassed by it. He had not felt like he meant it alpha at all. Now here's the rub: him paying should have in my case also been a red flag. Why did he pay? Simple: he used the old con man's adage that you initially do something to make the other person believe that you are trustworthy. He had targeted me for financial abuse. Just so we are clear: I had written explicitly on my long profile that I didn't care what my partner earned. He had deducted from several things that I must be a high earner. He incorrectly assumed that I was wealthier than him: we have extremely different education levels (think Ivy League PhD and no GED), but he is wealthier, because he always had a girlfriend to share his rent and pays little tax and has a rent controlled apartment etc. In his case, him deciding to take me to a restaurant instead of a coffee or walk date, actually taking care of reservations etc and paying the fall were all red flags! Nothing but red flags. 

And this is where I am mentally stuck: why do you believe any man would do a restaurant date unless he either wishes to financially or otherwise abuse you or you are massively better looking than he is? Just so we are clear yet again: I have completely opted out of dating men. But I don't quite see why men would ever invest unless they believe that their date is worth a lot: either financially for abuse (or in general a good victim in the sense of vulnerable empath as a bangmaid) or because she is way out of his league looks-wise. I just can't imagine any other type of man agreeing to this anymore. Just like there are close to no men anymore who are willing to wait for sex because there are so many women who will sleep with him faster (or if he is unattractive and has no charm, he still will at least imagine that they will). Just like most women accept coffee dates or walks unfortunately (well, I have been on a few dates in the past where I was also glad to be able to get away faster than a dinner date would have allowed).

The other thing where I'm stuck: I have been in high-powered jobs in the past, but doubt I ever will again due to illness and the career and financial fallout from the abuse. Again: I am exclusively dating women after the abuse I suffered from men, but this is the second thing where I am stuck- the advice on financial stability and health would mean that I should remain alone forever as should any other man with disability or ill health. What's your take on that overall? Actually, I know several people with my illness in high-powered careers, but all with a partner who makes that posible. One of these is a woman married to a man. Probably the only man with a very high real empathy level I have ever encountered. By ""real"" I am referring to the fact that psychopaths/narcissists are better at seeming empathetic in research settings than normal men. Men who are payed to display empathy in research settings reach the same levels of empathy as women, too. Much higher than his wife, who otherwise is also lovely. Were he not married, he would nonetheless not be attractive to me due to his anorexia ironically.",2,1728063579.0,WomenDatingOverForty,2,1.0,False

Last month, I sent here a version of my query. The reception was quite good, and the feedback I got really helped me \*thank you, guys, for that\* 

I applied the feedback to the blurb and made a few tweaks, and now I come back with another attempt. 

  
Seventeen-year-old Diana Mason just wanted a prosperous life. Working at a New York coffee shop to help her unemployed mother, while the fear of losing her ill sister consumes her, makes her desire a different reality. Everything‚Äôd be better if her father hadn't disappeared, leaving an unfillable void in her heart. Her ordinary life changes when a mysterious man arrives at her job with an opportunity. Diana‚Äôs courage and determination attracted the attention of the secret agency C.A.D.E., who selected her for biannual spy training. The agency pays more money than Diana ever dreamed of. The chance to help her family and get the life she always wanted arrives. Diana leaves for the peculiar world of C.A.D.E., the agency hidden underneath the Mojave Desert, where robots and submarine cars are as commonplace as the blue sky.¬† ¬†

The training consists of eight phases, where in each one, fifteen recruits face different challenges - such as learning to fight, facing fears in hyper-realistic simulations, and surviving in extreme scenarios - which become more dangerous as the training progresses. At the end of each phase, C.A.D.E. eliminates the worst performing recruit, taking their money, skills learned during training, and C.A.D.E.-related memories, returning them to their old lives like blank canvases. Only the best recruits become agents. ¬†¬†¬† ¬†

Diana finds herself at an enormous disadvantage. The other recruits are physically more prepared; the challenges are like nothing she has faced before, and to her surprise, she‚Äôs the only girl among the recruits. As if the pressure isn‚Äôt enough, Diana discovers that her father is a C.A.D.E. agent, and he‚Äôs closer than she thinks. Diana must overcome her limits and carry on the phases while accepting that her father wasn‚Äôt who she thought he was. To become an agent, aid her loved ones, and preserve her identity, Diana must be more than just strong. She must be brave.¬†

Quick disclaimer here: The Brave is YA, and C.A.D.E. is very much unlike real-life intelligence agencies (if that wasn't clear from the blurb). It was all made up and imagined. I didn't take much from the history and rules of real-life agencies because I wanted to create the lore for this science-fantasy world. 

Feel free to dissect the query, and if you can tell me what I'm doing right and wrong, I'll appreciate it very, very, very much.

Am I looking to deeply into this and just freaking myself out over nothing? I'm confused here and everything I read online contradicts itself.

In 1777, **King Frederick II of Prussia** banned coffee because he believed it was a waste of money and that it was harmful to people's health.

In 1977, **the government of Taiwan** banned coffee, fearing that it would harm the country's economy.

While outright bans on coffee are rare in modern times, there have been some recent instances of restrictions and regulations that might be considered ""bans"" in a broader sense.

Proposed Ban on Coffee While Driving: In 2017, a New Jersey lawmaker proposed a bill that would prohibit drivers from drinking coffee or other beverages while behind the wheel.

Recalls and Bans on Specific Coffee Products: Occasionally, specific coffee products are recalled or banned due to safety concerns.

Restrictions on Coffee Consumption in Certain Public Spaces: Some institutions or public spaces may have rules limiting coffee consumption.

These examples highlight the ongoing concerns and debates about coffee consumption in modern society, whether it's about health, safety, or social etiquette.

Been a listener for decades and a donor for years and years. Never really took advantage of any perks other than getting a cool t-shirt every year or so. Wanted to share a few cools things about the tour.

* The taste of the music director is basically the *only* controlling factor for what new music gets played. It was Don Gates (Slack) for 30 years until 2023. Of course, it's Chris Sanley and associate director Alex Ruder now. It was real brief, but I think we said hi to each of them in the hall.
* Their physical library is pretty awesome. I've heard on-air mentions of how big it is, but it was really cool to see in person. The best part was how most everything seem to be original release, and had stickers all over them (especially the vinyl) with notes from DJs about what they thought. Original pressing (I think) of [Daydream Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daydream_Nation): ""The next Rush...?"" Followed by something like ""No way!""
* I poked around the thousands upon thousands of CDs: they need more Weezer.
* They use software called Dalet that has everything digitized. From music (of course) to the ""I'm [blah] and you're listening to the Afternoon Show..."" stuff. It seemed pretty neat.
* When they don't have a digital version of a song a DJ wants to play, they grab it from the library and rip it right there.
* Got to talk to Evie before Drive Time. Learned about how playlists are sort of curated: low/medium/high rotation, anchor songs, and the DJ's choice. Saw how she just googled a lot of ""this day in music"" stuff for things like birthdays, album releases, etc.

A few other things:

* Troy was able to poke his head out and say hi. He was doing the Afternoon Show for Larry yesterday.
* Their ""cube farm"" is pretty typical for an office setting. Amazing how many desks there are. A lot more people work there than I thought.
* I found my plaque (Smashing Pumpkins lyric). [Neat](https://imgur.com/v2IzYy3).
* Every band gets a $500 stipend for a session. There's a TON of hardware for sessions, and the room is much smaller than I thought.
* The green room has a wall where artists sign as they come through. [Picture](https://imgur.com/fq6GuI0). They have a washer/dryer in there, heh. One cool thing going on right now is are artists writing love letters and pinning them up.
* Heard the story of when The Smile came through for a session, Thom Yorke just walked through a packed gathering space, and nobody recognized him. The volunteer (forget her name) told us her giddy story about how she ""touched his hand!"" when she handed him some coffee/tea. Pretty funny.
* They have a lot of framed gold records hung up. Saw several from Vampire Weekend. Saw their YouTube plaque for 1 mil subs.
* I now understand what it means whenever I hear ""down the hall"" on the air (like where the live room is compared to the DJ booth).

Overall, it was a pretty cool experience. Katie Weiss was a pretty good guide. I really want to attend a live session when I can get out of work for an afternoon.",8,1728062908.0,KEXP,5,1.0,False

Long Post Ahead, TLDR at the end~

My best friend of 15 years played  Outer Wilds this week. He doesn't have a whole lotta time to play games these recent years, but we made a deal. I play Evil Within 2 and he'd play OW since they're our favorite games. When his time came, I was extremely excited to see him play the only game that manages to make me cry/tear up every time I finish it.

Boy, was I not ready for the absolutely wild experience we were about to have. He, like I'm sure all of us did, spent about an hour on Timber playing around with the little ship and meeting everyone. Learned the game. After that hour he got the ship codes and off he went.

His first stop? The Sun. His second stop? The Sun. His 3rd stop? Crashing into Dark Bramble(Trying to find our favorite Adventurer), straight into one of our big boys. After about another hour of us laughing, and him dying in the worst ways possible, he finally decides to start his journey with Giants Deep. First he explored what he could of the Prob Launcher, he met Timebro, found the frozen Jelly Fish (Get Feldsparred), couldn't get under the current, and tried to get into the Statue Workshop.

After this, his next stop were the Hourglass Twins. They called out to him. They were such an impossibility that he had to visit them. After landing on Ember Twin he made his way to the Sunless City, with the sand covering most of the city all ready, he couldn't explore much. He has been noticing this strange symbol here and there, but it must be something important? After being crushed to death, he pointed his curiosity to Ash Twin.

During this loop he sat on Ash Twin, unknown to him, for the duration of his life. He was convinced the Solar Panels were something incredibly important that could point him in the right direction. After nothing came out of it, he noticed the Sun has been changing during his runs and as he asks me if he was overlooking the cycle it started the music. He watched as the Sun went Super Nova. He finally knew what has killed him during his runs on Giants Deep. After that death he decided to check out the strange towers that were on Ash Twin.

At this point he knows literally fuck all. Barely has found any form of important info, due to him exploring at random with no direction. He did go to Brittle Hollow and met our terrified banjo boy, but he ended up falling through the Black Hole, picking up enough speed to get back to Hollow, and then slammed his head into the Black Hole forge, dying. The Towers would surely tell him something, right? They told him more than either of us bargaines for.

While exploring the towers he died to the Sun Warp 3 times, convinced he could enter by carefully flying through the Cacti. Finally he moves to the next Warp, a set of two buildings. He was reading and looking around, with time frozen of course as he read. While hiding from the sand column he accidentally backed up into the Ember Twin Warp. Extremely confused he ended up walking around again, but the sand was already decently flowing, so he reset the loop thanks to Timebro's advice. What to do now?

Time to act like a Nomai and form a hypothesis! He is a lot like me and immediately wanted to figure out how to replicate what he did. So he slammed the peddle to the metal, slamming into Ash Twin in the process, and waited for the sand to fall. And waited. And waited. And wa- Oh look, it's uncovered. It took him some time as he was stepping on and off it. Reading to see if it needed a trigger. Then he noticed the glass, it almost looked like a compass or an iron sight. So he waited patiently as the sand came over, just like it was the last time, and the oop. There he was, standing on Ember. He got off the platform and realized it was still glowing, so he stepped on it, and oop. Right back where he was. How interesting.

After this, he reset the loop and told me ""Coffee, I have an idea. You can make fun of me all you want, I know it may be stupid and a waste of time."" I had no idea what he was thinking, but I had a feeling he was onto something. When we find something like that we are usually quick to wanting to figure out what puzzle lies before us. He went to Ash Twin and waited until Hourglass Warps were uncovered. He moved his attention to the broken tower, it was weird that this tower had 2 Warps, but at the time was assuming it was just another point for Ember. The sand came by, but no warp. He did however get sucked into the sand. So he made the jump back to Ash and tried again, trying to use the broken iron sight in the ceiling to stop himself. Slamming into Ember Twin and getting some sand in his suit, he flew back up. Trying to get a better look, with out sand sucking him into the neighboring planet, he hid in a little cubby. As the sand crossed he was confused. Maybe the Warp doesn't wor- Oh, something happened. He rushed to walk into the pad and woke up in a place he had never seen before. 

The ATP. As he was finishing up reading everything, the end was about to kick in at any second. He noticed some Nomai tech, similar to the Prob Launcher. So he turned off the gravity and opened up the core. He noticed the center opened and drifted to it, picking it up out of curiosity. Everything stopped. He realized he had to take it somewhere, so he quickly got out of the ATP and opened his map and decided there were only two possible locations he could think of and started with the one planet he hadn't really went to. Dark Bramble. On his way though, he unfortunately got Nova Bombed.

Using knowledge he had gained by scanning the Ember Twin Escape Pod, he followed Feldspars harmonica and met our boy. He realized that, just like real ones, the Anglerfish were blind. While talking to Feldspar he learned of his great adventures and about how bad Jelly Fish tasted, he reset this loop for another quick Bramble visit when he realized there was an Escape Pod signal coming from it while he was looking for Feldspar. He followed the signal carefully and found the resting place of some unfortunate Nomai. He eventually remembered that he had a prob and followed the signals to the Vessel. Absolutely adoring the Egg Room to death as he passed through it, thinking it was extremely cool.

This is where he realized the broken core could be replaced, so he reset the loop, grabbed the core, and hauled ass to the Vessel as fast as he could. He got ate the first run, but he did manage to get there on the second. Let's plug this bad boy in and... Why is it asking for patterns? He realized that he needed something he didn't have, so stumped he went the only place where someone that understands him would be. Giants Deep.

Back to ""Thalassaphobia Box Checked"", he chills with our Sans stand in. After realizing he had no new knowledge, he figured out the Statue Workshop. Given knowledge he already knew now, thanks to the ATP, he stood on a cliff side. The view was nice and calming, before he was thrown into space for a moment. Landing in water, he swam back to his ship and started to leave the planet. As he lifted off he noticed something weird. One of the cyclones were spinning in the opposite way than the others. If the others launch him into space, then surely this one would do something different? He went to go into it and oop, sent to space due to getting sucked into a different one. He went back down and found it again. Going into it he got sucked down past the current, realizing what he did he sank down until he fried his ship. As he's working on fixing it, a Jelly Fish calmly floats up next to him. Did someone mention they were awful to eat? No that wasn't the important part, these little dudes are basically made of rubber! He swam up into it's main body and decended until he was in the core. He looked around for awhile, not sure why this would be so hard to find until he noticed a Nomai structure. He never noticed the Prob Launcher showed a piece falling, so he had no idea what he was about to find.

Over 9 million loops before we were aware of the loop... Unknowing.. How terrifying, but hey look, neat patt- Holy shit they're coordinates! Piecing everything together he set off to put a plan into motion, but I told him to wait a moment. I have not given him any hints up until this point, but he specifically asked me to tell him when he should do the DLC. After letting him know it's time, he set off on a new adventure.

A while hour.. It took this man a while ass hour to realize that he wasn't supposed to try to figure out the angle and that he was supposed to go to the Deep Space Satellite. Eventually he clicked it all together and made his way to a weird planet blocking out the Sun a bit. As he got closer and closer, there was nothing but space in front of him for some reason, until suddenly he was in front of a massive ship. He slowly looked at it, before being swatted like a fly during lunch by the rotators. He entered and loved the boat section, but not finding a whole lot to work with, he moved from the first area and drifted to the next. By this time, the Dam was about to break and he found a house with a little secret. That Tower had a secret passage? Strange, he had to know why. So he went to find it, suddenly there was a loud noise. He looked over and the Dam had broken, causing a wave to carry him away from what he was trying to look at. He made a whole trip around and ended up missing his stop, causing him to go around again. As he was getting back, the Tower fell and exposed the cave. Resetting, he rushed back.

He explored the Tower and eventually learned of the trick on how to access the Chamber. I should point out that he found an Artifact and has been holding one every single time he enters The Stranger. He did the lights and entered a room with a strange fire. Trying to ignore the corpses around him, and apparently not bothered by the extremely unsanitary conditions of the room, he goes to cook a marshmallow. I hear him go ""Fuck"" as he hit the wrong button. He quickly tried backing out, but when he woke up he wasn't where he was. Realizing he found something interesting, he obsessed over the Dream World. Trying a bunch of things, but never being able to turn those pesky alarms off. ""Coffee... I have to know"" he said after a reset. Arriving back in that room he stares at the fire, holding an Artifact as usual. ""This could be the dumbest idea I've had, but I have to know something."" and he stepped into the fire. As he died he starts to tell me ""It was worth a tr-"" He was in the Dream. He died though, did the Dream save him before he actually died?

Not noticing a difference he looked around as normal. Going to Prisoners in game house, he didn't notice the Alarm wasn't ringing, thinking he just was figuring out timing as he snuck by it. On the way back though, he realized it was strangely silent. Deciding to leave the artifact kit, he stared at the Alarm. It should have woken him up like the first time it went off. ""Dead things can't wake up"" he said. With this knowledge he went to the pit and found the Forbidden Archive.

Feeling like that was finished, he decided to try the first area and got into the chamber. Sleeping, he went in. Eventually getting swept away by the water, he reset. Eventually learning how to light to totems and summoned a... Boat? He followed the boat until he got to the final location and learned about the Diving Bell existence. Not understanding he set sail again. Passing by the dock and realizing he wanted to go back, he went to step off the boat to put his flame out, only to do it as he was entering the Loading Section, falling through the map. Thinking he broke the game, I was muted screaming. He stumbled onto the Archive there and learned more, realizing he yet again tripped his way right into another core mechanic.

Next loop he decided to go to the Tower and pull the same trick. He realized there was more in this area than he thought when he first fell through the map. He deactived the first lock. Realized that the Alarms protected another one, he woke up and died to deactivate the second lock. He wandered around and tried opening the coffin. Got the vision and then got the vision and then got the vision... He did this many times trying to skip it after the accidental second watching of it. Finally the tower fell, so he went to the next loop.

Before doing what he did prior in the last loop, he figured out the Tower secret. Of course all the codes were burned. Going back in and returning to the coffin area, he tried turning every light on. Then he tried turning them all off. It was dark. Maybe he could see something in the dark that he can't with the light? Everything on The Stranger is light activated after all. So he sat his Artifact down on the elevator and went towards the coffin. ""Well that was a stupid id-"" before he finished the sentence he witnessed the Matrix. He was stunned and thought he had broken the game again before realizing that it was a mechanic. He could see platforms that weren't visable to him earlier. He deactivated the last lock and decended. I was baffled. He flailed his way through the whole DLC with out seeing a single Owlk until Prisoner. I informed him that he had beaten the DLC and he was little sad that he stumbled on the core mechanics to complete it so soon.

After beating Echoes, he moved onto the base games ending and brought everyone together. He enjoyed the game and wants to know all the pieces, so he is currently working towards 100%ing both the base game and DLC. All of us laughed over the fact that pure dumb luck and autistic obsession over things that peak our curiosity drove him to theorize and do things. He realized that out of the 3 species, he'd def end up being a Nomai.

TLDR; My best friend finally played OW and it's DLC and accidentally stumbled onto all of the core mechanics with out actually exploring or learning fuck all, beating them both in 3 sessions that combined were less than 24 hours.",2,1728062557.0,outerwilds,0,1.0,False

My husband, elderly cat, and I are visiting St Pete in early February. We'll be driving down from NW Arkansas, and we're visiting specifically to skate, bike, and eat our way around your beautiful city :)

Legit, the only things we plan to do are: 1) skate (quad and rollerblade) and ride our bikes on paved trails 2) eat good food.

We are trying to figure out where to stay so we can have super easy access to paved trails (Pinellas maybe?) and also be able to walk to a few eateries/coffee shops. Ideally, we would love to be able to skate out our door and safely reach a trail within a block or two vs. having to drive to a trailhead. If that's not an option, being by a bus route that stops along a paved trail would also work!

Does anyone have suggestions on where to stay? Bringing our cat does complicate matters, but he's too old to leave behind since he needs multiple meds each day. So we'll be looking at cat-friendly AirBnbs! He's traveled with us many times without issues :) 

Side note, we would LOVE to meet up with other skaters if anyone feels like trail skating with us, too. Thank you so much, in advance, for any help with where to stay. Cheers, and we look forward to exploring your city soon!",0,1728062480.0,StPetersburgFL,8,0.38,False

I do not mind your age and your intentions. This is a throwaway account and I wouldn't mind sharing my main when we get talking. I have spoken to a lot of people here, most are very nice and hope I find another person like who I can meet in real person.

I have been living in Hyderabad for the past 20 years and if everything goes right I would be leaving the country this January. But, before that I would like to tick certain things off of my bucket list here in this city and country, which includes going on solo travels, road trips and city explorations with strangers.

About me - I am 6ft 2in dude who is relatively quite active, I am on mission to improve my 10K time this year. I would like improve my lifestyle and personality. Career wise, I have chosen something unique and have faced the consequence but the hardships apart, I would think of doing anything else in my life. My simple pleasures include watching a movie late in the night, playing table tennis, going for a run while its drizzling outside and just walk outside with my earphones on. All my life I have been extremely shy, but you know I am the kind who cannot shutup if we become close. My humor is my defense mechanism and its probably the iron dome of defense mechanisms. I have referrences who can vouch for me.

What am I looking for ?

I am just here to find a partner, to chill and hangout with while I am still here. We could go for cute coffee dates, exploration outings and once you are comfortable we could go on trips. I am looking for a buddy to constantly yap about my day and listen to you do the same. Although I do not open up easily but I could give you the emotional support you need. Honestly, I know we all have our life commitments and priorities, and I respect that so you wouldn't need to worry about me being clingy. We could just keep the partnership simple to exploration, playing table tennis, going to guitar lessons, pottery classes, book clubs or simply walking in a park listening to the same music. And oh! I would die for you if you are as crazy as me for formula 1 ! Can't live without it !

So how about we start off with a cute little coffee date ! Better don't expect roses but I bet I would surprise you with something.

If you have read till here, then I would also like to mention that in the past I did get some messages and yes we are still in touch and are good friends. But as of now I am seeking for people who I can meet and interact more intimately in my life. I do not mind people from other cities texting me, I would not mind talking to you but can you please be clear with your intentions before we begin.

Hoping to see you, cheers !",1,1728062268.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1fw4fdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthlineoff/comments/1fw4fdc/how_to_support_someone_experiencing_abuse/,How to Support Someone Experiencing Abuse,"**Helping someone who is experiencing abuse is not always easy. You can focus on providing support by offering a safe and judgment-free space, being patient, and letting them know they are not alone.**

Abuse can occur in many ways. It can be emotional, physical, financial, sexual, and spiritual. It can also involve stalking and neglect.

If a loved one is experiencing abuse, you may want to intervene yourself or push them to make a decision, like leaving an abusive partner right away. However, it‚Äôs often better to remain patient, follow your loved one‚Äôs timeline, and offer advice when needed.

If a situation escalates and becomes violent, or you believe an adult or child is in danger, you should call 911 or local emergency services immediately.

**Let them know you believe them**

Many peopleTrusted Source going through abuse feel as though they are to blame. They may have experienced gaslighting or dismissal from their abuser. This can lower self-esteem, making it harder for someone to open up about what they are going through in fear of receiving a similar response from others.

It is important to ensure your loved one knows their emotions are valid. When talking with them, try using supportive language such as:

‚ÄúI believe you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is not your fault‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have done nothing to deserve this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am sorry this happened to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am really glad you confided in me. That must have taken a lot of courage.‚Äù

**Remind them they‚Äôre not alone**

ResearchTrusted Source shows that people who have experienced abuse are more likely to also experience social isolation and loneliness.

In situations of intimate partner violence, the perpetrator may have created an environment where the person is no longer able to contact family or friends. This lack of a support network can often leave people more vulnerable to further abuse.

You can remind your loved one that they are not alone and that many support options are available to them.

**Offer a safe and judgment-free space**

Creating a space that feels safe and judgment-free is vital for someone experiencing abuse to feel supported.

When having a conversation with your loved one, be an active listener. Allow them to offload. It can take a lot of courage to open up about abuse.

Try to keep checking in with them and offer practical ways they can reach out to you. For example, their partner may be monitoring their text messages and phone calls, or their home may not be a safe space. Suggest meeting at an alternative location, such as a coffee shop or park, so your loved one can speak openly.

**Encourage them to seek help**

It is important to avoid telling your loved one they must respond in a certain way, such as ‚ÄúYou have to report this‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have to leave them.‚Äù

However, you can advise your loved one on what they could do, such as seeking help from professional organizations.

Thank you to u/twentytwozines for the amazing ""perzine"" (that's a new term for me) and all the goodies. Your writings on grief and trauma and escapism are powerful, and coupled with the Stuffed Animals and other whimsical pages: you seem to be coping creatively and as well as you can. Thank you for the insight into your world.

Thank you, u/ninajyang, for the Chakaia Booker postcard. And congrats again on your 7K!

u/TyeDyeAmish, I love the Firenza postcard - very nice! I'm still working through my WPD postcards, so you'll get yours soon! :)

Happy early Halloween, u/yetanotherblankface, and thank you for the Halloween postcard! I love apple flavours, too; sadly, pumpkin spice is EVERYWHERE.

How is your postcard collection progressing, u/chiquita61? Thank you for the Crater Lake postcard. :)

I laughed at your answer, u/travel4me22! I am often abrupt myself, but you just gave me the BEST rationalisation - freeing up time to get stuff done! 

Thanks for the tea, u/Lethbridge-Totty! And tell Bella I said psst psst psst"" for helping you write the card. I was actually thinking of sending you another card .... if I can get through all these World Postcard Day cards I'm sending, LOL!

Thank you for the Pineapple Stuffing recipe and beachy card, u/ridethatbridge! Christmas in July is always fun - I love Christmas so much that I'll welcome it ANY time!

Hello u/rennbrig! I have been to that coffee shop many times, even though I don't drink coffee (only tea). And I adore Mount Purrnon! You should check out [this crazy cat who went absolutely BUGNUTS](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_TvgrACE1i/) for the tuna squeezy tube (""the pink one""). And Buddy is adorable... awwwww. 

Thankyou, u/LadyChristmas, for the lovely letter. I'm often slow to reply, but your letter IS on my desk; I just need to get through a ton of postcards and other administrative tasks first!

Thank you u/stillsheryl for the WPD raspberrypaper card! I am still working on WPD postcards, so you'll have some weirdness in your mailbox soon!

Hey yall, 
I got the Delonghi dedica espresso machine a couple of months ago and have been using it regularly to make lattes. One issue I dont seem to understand is the portafilter. When I insert it, the whole machine moves while inserting it. If I hold the machine with my other hand and push in the opposite direction, then I can push the porafilter all the way through. Is there some kind of stickers I'm supposed to be using at the bottom of the machine? What am I doing wrong. 
Also, whne I steam milk. The machine makes a periodic thumping sounds.

For reference, I use pre ground coffee and am still a beginner =) 
Any advice would be appreciated 
Thanks in advance!

1fw4d5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1fw4d5y/i_actually_had_a_good_week/,I *actually* had a good week!,"Timings wise, I‚Äôm in the peak of my luetal phase so I should be in hell week, but things have been good this week and I think it‚Äôs because I took a break. 

I know, I know, that advice is always üôÑüôÑüôÑ but hear me out. Sunday night I felt very teary and could feel the PMDD coming. Monday I was WFH so I tried to wake up and do something before work as that sometimes makes me feel better and sets me up for the day. I did some tidying and put a load of washing on. I went to work from the front room instead of bed, did some work, had some coffee but by lunchtime I still felt the same as the previous night/the morning. 

So instead of pushing through, I decided to just take the afternoon off work. Because I didn‚Äôt feel *that* bad, that would‚Äôve usually been one of those situations where I would‚Äôve guilt tripped myself into working and tell myself that I‚Äôm being weak and I can get through the day. But instead I took the afternoon off so I could rest, order some food and watch TV, and I felt better by the evening. I did then also have therapy on Tuesday morning, which probably helped too, but for the rest of the week, I‚Äôve felt generally fine. I‚Äôve had a few wobbles but nothing like usual. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the be all and end all, and there will be times where it‚Äôs just not possible and I‚Äôm super privileged to make that choice, but I really do think giving myself the grace, how I talked to myself and my perception of the situation, changed the trajectory of my whole week.

1fw4cl2,https://i.redd.it/cl6mqmgxursd1.png,AU and stuff pt.1,"Currently working on the rest of the gang's art and probably a rework of both Aevis and Crescent but I'll probably get to it after getting a new digital pen.

Also a bit of lore drop on my AU of Pok√©mon Rejuvenation by Jan the legend themselves. This AU is purely based on stupid shounen like headcanons I have that I based on some art posts of Zumi from twitter and other social networks I probably don't know and said post is the whole character classes of each Rejuv characters mainly the A-team's since they are kinda one of thee most mysterious characters that we both know and don't know that and also the legends/myths in their Extreme team. Some of these headcanons come from others one of them being: rejuvenatingbeginnings mainly their school life but their life outside said school is filled with my numerous shounen and the anime ver of Pok√©mon itself.

Example: AU ""Out of Order""

Interceptor!Aevis: Wasn't actually tired or too affected by the event... just doesn't want to decide someone's fate anymore not after what happened with his work and AÕêÃíÃáÕ©ÕãÃÉÃæÃáÃïÃüÃ§ÃñÃóÕàÃ¶ÕîÃÆÕäÃÅÃèÕíÕ£ÕõÃ∏Ã¥ÃπÕìÕçÃònÕßÕÉÃÅÃøÃ®ÃïÃ•ÕçÃ¨ÕàaÕóÃ∑ÕÄÃôÃ¨ÕçÃ™ÃóÃùÃ§Ã™. 

School!Aevis: Typical classroom president, role model student and ace volleyball player, gets dragged into school board meetings, and is friends with just about everyone in the staff.

Home!Aevis: Coffee junky, constantly down to take on odd jobs for his ""work"" and was quite literally dragged by his scarf into the gang just to sleep or even get out of his room.

My thoughts while I was making the redesign was kinda all over the place since I didn't exactly know how to integrate both designs of the updated version of Aevis and his Legacy version so I tried giving him a mobster like hat with a brooch of one of his aces Decidueye but with that it also came to me that he wasn't even a mobster but more of refined gentleman with a skewed sense in fashion...look at his Legacy and both Updated 1.0 and 2.0 outfits and their alternate outfits bro be wearing hoodies, sweaters, coats, scarfs, and hats with either some fucked shorts over leggings, skinny fuckin jeans, or even cargo pants.

So I tried ""Balance"" and it kinda works sort of? Because I kinda mixed both Legacy and Update 2.0 as his clothing optiona with his black and gray jacket having more of a black and dark teal coloring like that of shiny Decidueye with the teal not really standing out too much only working as accents just like the greens on his coat in 2.0 while the rest of his fit being pulled from 2.0 with his shorts over his leggings and so on with his shoes taking more of a darker coloration similarly to his jacket. Main thought here is that he is odd in his tastes but it works in his favor with his jobs at Terajuma mainly at Angu's nevermeltice shop as a delivery boy with how cold which she'll probably be constantly talking to him if his sure about said outfit and if his school life as a ace volleyball player is getting held back by said odd jobs. As for the concept name being balance you'll probably findout once I actually start continuing my work on AO3 but I'll probably be too lazy for now.",4,1728061794.0,PokemonRejuvenation,0,1.0,False

She had just come off a brutal losing streak in Street Fighter 6, and Master Rank felt like a distant dream. ""Kimmy, you look beat,"" Ock said, eyeing her from behind the counter as he wrapped up a sandwich. ""Still grinding for that Master Rank?""

""Yeah,"" she sighed, leaning against the drink fridge. ""Feels like every time I‚Äôm close, someone knocks me down."" Without a word, Ock slid her a bag of plantain chips and an iced coffee. ""On the house. Fuel for the fight,"" he said with a grin. Kimberly smiled, taking a sip. His advice was always simple: keep showing up, keep pushing through. He‚Äôd built this bodega with grit, and she knew the grind was the same, whether you were selling sandwiches or chasing virtual victories.

With a renewed spark, Kimberly nodded. ""Thanks, Ock."" She stepped back into the street, mind refocused. Master Rank was still in her sights, and with each match‚Äîwin or lose‚Äîshe knew she was one step closer.

1fw4b5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1fw4b5a/im_burning_out_before_training_is_over/,I'm burning out before training is over ,"Well, to be fair, I'm burning out because there is no fucking training. Videos about how coffee is roasted in Puerto Rico do not prepare me for peak.

When I applied, I put in for barista. I worked Tarbucks for about 2 months over 2 years ago, and also never got any official training there. But I was familiar enough to know ~something~ even though my target definitely made drinks with love instead of standards. My interviewer suggested I apply for shift supervisor since the store needed one and I have experience that could translate to leadership skills. 

In the past two weeks, I've completed the barista first 30 and then shift first 30 and I still don't know hardly anything. I found out this morning that I've been making fraps wrong this entire time. My store is a lot of new partners and has been extremely bare-bones for a bit, so I know we aren't like leading the district, but no one saw my watery fraps and wanted to correct me? 

How do you want me to be a shift supervisor and coach people when I don't know the standards?? I kinda feel like it's insulting to my coworkers that I'm this untrained and being left in charge of keys and money, but at least that means they can make the drinks I don't know how to while I do the pull. 

For some reason that was never once explained to me, I am spending 3 days of my training at a different store running the plays. Today was the first. How in the actual fresh hell should I call plays for partners I have never met, in a store I have never been in before?? The manager I was shadowing worked bar for peak while I did cold, and then disappeared for the remainder of the shift and told me to lead it. I went back to ask her a question and I shit you not she was playing candy crush. I ended up finding another ssv on floor and asking him for help the entire time, defaulting the play calling to him. So I didn't even do the thing I was there to learn.

I feel confident enough about the pulls, inventory, etc. I can count tills and the safe, but I can't say I'm confident enough yet. Mostly because they asked me to close by myself the first time because someone called out, and a few minutes before close, I got a viscous phone call from someone so infamous around Starbucks that even the store I'm guesting at knew him. It rattled me so bad that I completely messed up my entire money count, got so lost in the app and counting and was just too frazzled. I called my manager (who was sitting in the parking lot for her store keys) for help, but I guess even though she said it looked all good, it wasn't. I was told the drawers were off the next day but not what I did or how to fix it, just to be more careful. 

I understand that partners, especially shifts, need to know all aspects of the routine but I got hired as a closing shift and after tomorrow, I'll have had 4 opening shifts where I was the playcaller, 1 mid, and 1 closing that wasn't even supposed to happen. Why in the fuck won't one of the managers training me move THEIR schedule around for a bit so I can get more night training? 

Don't even get me started on how everyone keeps saying ""well this will change soon so there's no reason to learn it"" like okay?? I still need to know the dcr even if playcaller is replacing, and I might as well look at the current station checklists until the new ones are done, right? 

Today while I was shadowing at the store I've never been in, I spilled a few times. It happens, and I saw it happen to other baristas while I was there. But instead of being kind or even worrying if I was okay after the fresh tall pike went down my leg and into my shoe, another shift gave me a nickname about my spillage and made sure to tell baristas clocking in my nickname. It felt like the final straw to have a woman twice my already old age make fun of me while I was in such pain. The paycheck that hit today was desperately needed, but I do not see myself lasting much longer if this is how it's gonna be. 

Someone tell me I'll soon become jaded enough that this shit won't bother me, including all the burns and injuries I've sustained. Or give me ideas on how to explain this feeling respectfully and ask for help from my manager. ",2,1728061688.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/dq76yaalursd1.jpg?width=926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dd460767b1aa0e8e599f5f3e7b67e0a307a2c0b

Names: Cosna,Meni,Sorre,Lunen

Cosna: color background: blue what type of line? wavy, orange colored, in the middle any additional things? yes, six yellow stars in 2 rows.

Meni: color background: black what type of line? kinda diagonal, there are three lines colored green, blue and purple any additional things? yes, you guessed it, a star. in the top left corner.

Sorre: color background: blue and green (blue at the top, green at the bottom) (they don't take half and half, blue takes like 70-80%.) what type of line? there's no line any additional things? a silhouette of a white coffee cup

Lunen: color background: black what type of line? again, no line how does it look like? black, two green triangles at the bottom left and right corners (they should stretch enough to touch the top left and right corners). then, we have a triangle that's colored in three different colors. the low part is black, middle part is purple, top part is light blue)

anyways, let's go onto their information: Cosna: gender: male pronouns: he/him date of birth: March 15, 2006 age: 18-19 place of birth (if it was in real life): Slovenia height (in real life): 5'6 favorite food: noodles favorite US state: Colorado or Montana favorite game: chess

Meni: gender: male pronouns: he/him/they date of birth: May 24, 2009 age: 15-16 place of birth (in real life): Estonia height (in real life): 5'3 favorite food: steak favorite US state: California favorite game: Uno

Sorre: gender: female pronouns: she/her/them date of birth: July 18, 2007 age: 17-18 place of birth (in real life): Latvia height: 5'5 favorite food: soup favorite US state: none, has never visited the United States favorite game: Roblox

Lunen: gender: male pronouns: he/him/they date of birth: December 21, 2008 place of birth: Romania age: 16-17 height: 5'4 favorite food: i still need more time to think about this favorite US state: Alaska favorite game: chess

fun facts: Sorre is the only flag that is female,and also the only one that has a silhouette in its design.

All of these made up flags are straight and they all prefer not to be identified as any other type of gender.

Lunen has a different shade of blue in their design, every other one has sky blue.

All of my flag OC's come from Europe. They all also have ages between 15-19.

Sorre is the only one that has never visited the United States.

Lunen is the only flag here that includes triangles in their design.

Lunen also kinda looks like Antigua and Barbuda but inverted and without the sun.

Cosna is the only one in which a wavy line is present in their flag.

Lunen in fact does not have a favorite food.

Meni is the only one that has more than one line.

This is not said, but every one of my OC's for some reason have pets. Cosna has a pet cat and a parrot, Meni has a like a bull dog, Sorre has two cats and one dog, and Lunen has a hamster, a cocktail, and two turtles.

anyways idk what to say but more information about them is coming soon

Recent History:
- 2022 Dec - Our daughter, our first child, was born
- 2023 Jan - My Brother, and only sibling, committed suicide at 31yr
- 2023 Aug - Family moves states for various reasons; I start a dream job opportunity for me, and we're closer to our family & long-term friends
- 2024 Mar - Wife, 34yr, diagnosed with triple negative invasive ductal Carcinoma; two tumors sized at 2.4 & 1.2 cm or so in one breast. Fast growing with a Ki-67 of >90.
- 2024 Mar-Jun - we go through IVF and do our best to prep for what's ahead 
- 2024 Jun/July - Bilateral mastectomies, recovery, and then her 24wk chemotherapy regimen begins. (Recovery included some rework of incisions and tissue expander injections for a post-chemo reconstruction)

Breast cancer is hard to deal with on its own, but our situation was far from stress free when this started. Since I hadn't been at my new job for a year yet, I could use what little PTO I had but FMLA wasn't an option. So I've been in survival mode for... a couple years now?

Since this has started, I've been trying to do the following while working full time:
- Help manage meal delivery from friends/family
- Keep our shared calendar updated with appointment info, and ensure that those most involved in helping us are aware of changes
- Keep us as reasonably well-informed about the details of the situation as possible; dcumenting doctors notes and things; preparing lists of concerns/questions my wife wants to make sure get discussed in any face-to-face meeting with her providers
- accompany her to most appointments
- take care of our 15yr old dog
- For our toddler; in the morning, I get her up, dressed, teeth brushed, and eventually drive her to my parents so they can watch her a few days each week. (Wife helps with breakfast). In the evenings; I do the bathing, the teeth brushing, the put down, clean the kitchen and our toddlers play area. (sometimes helping with the meal)
- when I'm working from home, I stop what I'm doing constantly to keep her comfortable; heat her eye masks, get her meds from the bathroom, refill waters, bring her snacks/meals... but I do struggle to respond as fast as she'd like
- be as supportive and loving as possible. Lots of hugs, I love yous, I think your beautifuls, general reassurance. I even ping various friends of hers to reach out to her when I can tell that she needs extra support or is too frustrated with me for one reason or another.

But... I'm crashing, hard. I see a therapist weekly, psychiatrist maybe every 6 weeks, and am as open/vulnerable with everyone who seems interested enough to hear it--I strongly believe any discomfort around doing so is worth it if the other person is okay with talking about it.

For a while now, I'm totally burnt out come evening, sometimes as soon as I drop off my daughter to be watched by someone. My hygiene has gotten worse, I've lost 15lb, once a week or so I end up feeling like I'm totally hungover (tight neck/shoulders, nausea, faint when standing, headache..  which can last a whole day or just an evening), and certain things are starting to slip in all aspects of my life. Sometimes, I have to rush through as much caregiving tasks as possible at the end of the day because I know I'm about to totally crash; having to lay in bed or on the floor somewhere for a few hours before I can continue addressing my to-do list, even though it may mean another night with 3-4hrs of sleep.

I get it when she's frustrated about one thing or another, she's always had really high expectations for the home she'll keep, and the mom she'll be, and often feels too shitty to meet those. I try to work with her on being more helpful, streamlining what I can, but I am at my limit and the extra chastising of my effort as failure only makes it harder for me to keep moving.

This morning, I took extra time to drink coffee while our daughter watched some TV, and she came out and finished getting our daughter ready to go as she chastised me for not stepping up... Again... But now she wants to have 'a serious talk about the family and my responsibilities' or something along those lines.

I feel like I've had this conversation in bite sized pieces so many times... But can't get myself to tell her that her expectations are just unrealistic; as committed as I am, I am also an imperfect human, with ADHD, anxiety and depression of my own. I do not know how many ways I can explain this without making her feel more hopeless, frustrated, and stuck. If she doesn't see my effort, and how I'm struggling to manage it, I don't know where to even start.

How the hell do y'all communicate your limits as a loving & committed caregiver? Or help your loved one tame their expectations? I've been pushing her to start seeing a therapist again, but she doesn't seem to want to reach out to anyone that I--or my own therapist--have found and suggested for her. She has reached out to a few that she's found, but so far none of them are in-network. I don't know what to do at the moment but sit there, try to stay engaged in a conversation where my efforts are belittled, try to pick up on how I might shift priorities, but overall try not to let it adversely affect my drive to keep going best I can without becoming cold and avoidant in the process...

I had this incident happen earlier today and I can't get it out of my head. I (39F) was in a coffee shop that was not crowded or busy.  There was a couple in front of me ordering a very complicated drink.  It was very difficult for me to follow but I gathered it was a pumpkin latte with no pumpkin and less milk (and more).  The staff tried to clarify many times what exactly they wanted and were met with rude, snarky replies.  After awhile they were presented with a drink.  The customer said why does this smell like pumpkin and it should be bigger and more confusion abounded.  For their credit, the staff were really trying to understand what they wanted but even I as an outsider could not make sense of it.  The customers were an older couple, maybe 50s or 60s, and were being incredibly rude in response, saying they were purposely messing up their order and had no ""customer service""
I was just buying a reusable cup, no drink and barely completed my order when the man started yelling at the two girls behind the counter.  When I turned around another staff member had appeared, saying she had called security and asked me to stay as a witness.  I had a seat and waited.  The coffee shop is shared within a larger department store.  I really meant to stay quiet but as it kept going it brought up a lot of feelings of working crappy service jobs, having people yell at you and being able to do nothing about it.  I also just wanted to leave and run about my day.  But because these people decided to make a scene that wasn't happening.  The man was in this woman's face and I suddenly and loudly told him to shut up and that he needed to leave.  Which made everyone stop and get quiet, and then he started asking who I was and that it's none of my business.  I informed him it was because now I have to deal with this whole situation and that they should just leave.  In the end managers came and security, they took my statement and I'm not sure what happened to the couple as they were walked further into the store. 
These types of people don't surprise me and I know you can't fix their deposition.  I'm just shocked I actually yelled at a complete stranger especially given how dangerous strangers can be these days.  But at the same time, I'm not embarrassed at all.  I'm unsure if I'm an absolute asshole or if I was in the right.  Has anyone had an experience like this? And if so, how did you deal with it? I'm afraid I will see them somewhere else and have issues.  Thank you for any input. ",6,1728061360.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

I've read a lot of posts from celiacs who say that they are actually more sensitive to gluten after being gluten free for many years.  For me, it has been the opposite but I feel like that just makes it more difficult to know how much I should actually be avoiding. (I'm not going out of my way to eat gluten. This is all from accidental glutenings.)  For example, I just noticed the instant coffee I've been drinking for the last 3 days has barley malt extract.

A bit of a backstory:

- I was diagnosed with eosinophilic pneumonia in 2020 after a bronchoscopy then was put on prednisone for 8 months. 
- After I was done for a few months I flared up again and was on prednisone again for 8 months.
- After my prednisone this time I started taking Nucala and felt much better. 
- And then I started drinking coffee every morning as I would feel tired ( I don‚Äôt remember when ).
- I stopped taking Nucala then as I was feeling good after another 10 months. 4 months out of Nucala I started wheezing a lot and felt like crap, so was put on Nucala didn‚Äôt do much I think I was on coffee this time but don‚Äôt remember and I now have eosinophilic asthma ( mind you I have all the symptoms but my breathing test number never met requirement of asthma ) 
- Fast forward now I stopped coffee, I‚Äôve been taking it every morning for more than 10 months, and it‚Äôs only been 4 days but I feel much much much better. I can finally work out without wheezing at all.

The display was off so I know the outlet must have fizzled out or somethinf. This happened once before, and it was fixed, but what's new is this time I was hearing a kind of buzzing sound intermittently. It sounded dangerous. This house is old, so I feel like the electricity might not be up to current standards, but I know nothing about it. Anyway when I asked my dad to look, we both saw a small orange flash come out behind the outlet. He unplugged the microwave and the buzzing has stopped.

He keeps saying he's worked with electricity all his life (he hasn't, just basic stuff like wiring lights, I don't think he knows about safety stuff) and I was asking him to please turn off the electricity in the area and he said it's fine as long as he touches the plastic and he knows what he's doing

But I kept insisting and we did go to where the breaker is in the basement and he wasn't able to identify the switch that goes to the microwave. Some of them are labeled kitchen but when we tested it the lights still worked fine and he gave up.

He claims he has identified the problem, that a wire isn't set up right, he thinks it's no big deal and he's about to go out and do stuff.

What do I do to prepare for the worst case scenario? Is it safe now that there's no longer anything plugged into it? Is there anything I should look for? If a fire breaks out is it safe to go to the breaker and just shut down everything? We have fire extinguishers but I've never used one.

Robert Eran stood at the edge of the path leading from his cottage, taking in the familiar landscape one last time before his departure. The Moors stretched out before him, rolling hills bathed in the early morning mist, a sight he had grown to know by heart. The journey ahead was one of both distance and time‚Äîa return to a world he had left behind years ago. With a flick of his wand, his bags floated gently beside him as he took a deep breath and disapparated with a soft pop.

He reappeared in the bustling chaos of King's Cross Station. The contrast was jarring ‚Äì a distinct difference from what he had grown accustomed to. Families hurried past trailing luggage, and the raucous sounds of the crowd and train whistles filled the air. Robert took a moment to orient himself, then made his way toward Platform 9¬æ. He was early- (as was his custom) but moved on with purpose, winding through the crowds.

He found the barrier between Platforms 9 and 10, and- casually leaning against it, fell past the magical barrier. Emerging on the other side, he was greeted by a sight that had come to be nostalgic to generations and generations of wizarding families. Light streamed in from the end of the tunnel, highlighting the vibrant contrasts of red and black that made up a great steam engine ‚Äì The Hogwarts Express. He took a moment, nearly alone except for a few other early birds, to puzzle to himself why he had never made it here on one of his research trips. Afterall, none could deny that The Hogwarts Express was a heavily enchanted machine itself.

His mind now thoroughly adrift, he had to ask himself- what did his parents think of this grand engine when they had dropped him off for the first time? Did they wonder these things about the giant engine on the platform, or did they ‚Äì like most pureblooded wizarding families, just take its existence for granted? He knew that he had, he had been too young. He had been more interested in the uninhibited access to chocolate. He‚Äôs saved up to buy every chocolate frog on the trolley witch‚Äôs cart- an attempt that had led him to meeting a fellow first year willing to fight him hook and fang for them.

‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù Robert answered himself. He had time for a cup. It was one of the benefits he enjoyed of his habit of getting anywhere he was going significantly early. Once you got there ‚Äì you had time to do as little or as much as you wanted to as quickly or as slowly as you wanted. Right now he felt like not doing much, and doing it as quickly as he could. He made his way back towards the entrance of the platform, greeted the young wizard working the counter, and found himself a table at which to sip and enjoy the quiet.  
  
‚ÄúRobert! Robert, is that you?‚Äù

He looked up, blinking as reality came sharply into focus. Striding toward him, a beaming smile on her face, was none other than Lavender Brown, an old housemate and friend from Gryffindor. She was accompanied by a shorter, blonde-haired man who Robert immediately recognized as Zacharias Smith. Robert's heart clenched at the sight of them together, He had not even known that Lavendar had survived the Battle of Hogwarts until years later. The last time he had seen her‚Ä¶. And then there was Zacharias. He knew Zacharias was alive, there was nothing for him to have survived in the first place. A bitter pang formed in his stomach that he thought he had quashed years ago.

""Lavendar Brown‚Ä¶. It can‚Äôt be you."" Robert stood, a practiced smile spreading across his face as they embraced in the way of old friends. ""It's been too long!"" He added, not wanting his voice to clue her in that his most prominent memory of her was still that horrid day.

""It has!"" she agreed, giving Robert an appraising look and a quick hug ""15 years and you look exactly like what I would have pictured you would. You haven‚Äôt changed a bit!""

Robert laughed politely, shaking his head. ""I'm not so sure if that's a compliment or an indictment‚Äù. He wanted to say the same for her, but that couldn‚Äôt be done without sounding patronizing. His Lavender Brown had been an intense girl, bubbly and dramatic. The Lavender he saw before him now was cheerful, but not in a way anyone would call ‚Äòbubbly‚Äô. The fierceness he remembered in her eyes was now replaced with a much quieter resolve than he would have expected from her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see the two of you are still together! It took a while to get used to, and I would hate to have to do that again!‚Äù Robert said, in the friendly type of banter they had always engaged in. But after meeting Zacharias‚Äô eyes- which held none of their old sardonic edge, he felt as if he was greeting a stranger. ‚ÄúWhat brings the two of you here?‚Äù he got out quick, trying to recover.

Lavendar puffed out her chest ‚Äì obviously proud of what she had to say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our Daisy‚Äôs first year! And Finn is starting his third! It has been QUITE the morning I tell you!‚Äù  
  
*Oh right* ‚Äì Robert thought to himself, that would be what most people would be here for. *It is a SCHOOL train after all*.

""Congratulations to both of you,"" Robert said sincerely, picturing the scene‚ÄîDaisy, wide-eyed and nervous, stepping onto the train for the first time, while Finn tried to play it cool in front of his friends. ‚ÄúI am sure you make a wonderful mother Lav‚Äù

Lavender clasped her hands to her cheeks and shook her head in glee.  
  
A few moments passed, surprisingly less awkward than Robert had expected.

""So, what brings you here, mate?"" Zacharias asked, his tone less curious than formal. Robert had almost forgotten Zacharias was there and now that he remembered, the awkwardness had returned in full force. ""You don‚Äôt look like you are here with kids of your own."" he continued.

""No. I‚Äôve actually been...recruited, I suppose. Headmistress McGonagall convinced me to take up a teaching position at Hogwarts this year. I‚Äôll be teaching a new subject‚ÄîEnchantry.""

‚ÄúWell I suppose If Enchantry is going to be taught, you‚Äôd be the one to do it. Nobody can deny you know the subject. Robert forced a polite chuckle. He knew that coming from Zacharias Smith, this was about as chest-thumping a statement of support you would get, and yet ‚Äì it lacked an edge. That scathing and acerbic tone that had dominated near every interaction you would have had with the Zacharias smith of 15 years ago. To anyone that did not know him the way his close friends did, he was cruel and about as un-Hufflepuff as you could be. Then again, apparently not even Zacharias‚Äô closest friends had known him for who truly turned out to be.  
(?MORE?)

It was a mercy when the sound of steam whistle pierced the air ‚Äì looking up, Robert noticed that the platform had swarmed into life around him. There were families giving last minute instructions to students through carriage windows, trunks being loaded, and a general bustle present that -in Robert‚Äôs mind- had not been there just a short while ago.

‚ÄúOh, I guess that‚Äôll be final boarding then. I guess I better get moving.‚Äù Robert said, standing to make his exit.  
  
Lavendar and Zacharias stood along with him, and after a tense handshake with Zacharias, he was nearly tackled by a hug from Lavender Brown. It was warm and nostalgic, and before letting go, she said to him ‚ÄúI see you doing great in this new role Robert, I really do.‚Äù

With that and a promise to stay in touch, Robert shouldered his bag and turned back towards the Hogwarts Express its carriages bulging with students. He made his way to the staff cabins at the front of the train. Since most of the staff had lodgings at or near the castle, he was thankfully able to find an empty cabin for himself. As the whistle blew and the train began to move, Robert settled into his seat, watching the platform slide away through the window. The familiar rhythm of the train on the tracks was soothing, beating out a lulling heartbeat as it took him out into the countryside. Robert allowed the train‚Äôs rhythm to relax him as it chugged down the tracks connecting his comfortable life behind him to the nostalgic yet unknown one ahead.",2,1728060291.0,HPfanfiction,1,1.0,False

1fw3q5u,https://i.redd.it/mmm55w9aqrsd1.jpeg,Open living/dining/kitchen space help!,"More pictures inside. We kind of messed up with our remodel and deleted our dining space.  What‚Äôs done is done.  We love having more cooking space, but now we are sitting with our two kids at the island to eat, and it can get uncomfortable because we are on high chairs and we are sitting in an L.  It‚Äôs also awkward to play board games and we end up on the floor usually. 

Originally, we thought that we would build a custom couch that would fit under the front windowsill in the living room (marked in yellow) and wrap around the wall ending at the door to the garage.  Our TV is on the short wall between the front door and the hallway.  We would then have a big low circular coffee table to eat and play games on.  There are many issues here.  It would not be the best height for eating, couch materials are harder to wash, and it still wouldn‚Äôt wrap around the table so everyone could face the center for games or whatever.  Also we have less energy to actually learn how and build a custom couch than we thought we would.  Easily found shapes are best in this case.

We also have a big dining table that is an heirloom for my husband‚Äôs family to consider.  It is a big dark hardwood harvest table from the late 1800s with 5 leaves that can seat 14 when fully extended.  As a circle, I think it‚Äôs 48‚Äù.  We would need to get new chairs for it.  

One option I‚Äôve considered is to split the area and have the dining table along the wall opposite the TV and have an L shaped sectional halfway into the room.  2 different area rugs would define those spaces.  

Another consideration is that we have a lot of books and things without a home and have been thinking about built in bookshelves along the upper half of the wall opposite the TV. 

I have been working with a professional organizer on and off trying to make sense of our home and she thought the bookshelves, dining table, and sectional would be able to fit in this space without it being too crowded.  

Sorry for the messy, unedited text and thinking out loud.  I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know what to do.  I will attach pictures of the actual space in the comments and please know that I did not tidy up at all for them and I don‚Äôt really care that you all see it this way.  It is life.  We have been using these target folding chairs and play couch cushions as placeholders while we figure it out and we are not in a huge rush.  We can fold them up and tuck things away to spread out on the floor with legos and whatnot.  But this will become less and less acceptable as the kids get older and we want to have friends over in a semi normal space.  

I‚Äôll be slowly making my way toward furnishing this properly with Facebook marketplace and resale shops.  I like slow, thoughtful decisions, but that often leaves me in limbo.

Still miss him so much. As we all do.   But a situation‚Äôs come up and I‚Äôd like to hear what you all think I should do.  

Basically, a widowed friend (new friend, haven‚Äôt known her long) is going to a grief session with the intentions of meeting and dating a specific widower, an old friend of mine. We‚Äôre in our 60s.

My old friend‚Äôs wife passed away around the same time as my husband. We aren‚Äôt ‚Äòdating‚Äô, but as widowers, we share a lot, go for coffee, lunch, we‚Äôre there for each other. A new friend of mine is a widow, her husband passed away about 5 years ago. She shared with me that she‚Äôs looking for a guy, and I told her yes, it‚Äôs nice having a someone talk to. She knows I‚Äôm casually seeing another guy (divorced). She says she‚Äôd love to have a guy, too, preferably a widower.



So here‚Äôs the thing.



We were talking about how difficult it is to lose our husbands. I suggested she try the local group grief sessions, said that my friend T goes there and he finds it very helpful. So she‚Äôs started going there, asked me T‚Äôs name, what he looks like. She hasn‚Äôt been able to make a connection with him, so she‚Äôs asked me to also join the group & and introduce them. Maybe ask him to go for coffee with us. It feels quite predatory to me, to go to a grief session with the idea of targeting a guy. 



Especially since I found out she‚Äôs been ‚Äòstalking‚Äô the guy I‚Äôve been seeing at his work (she couldn‚Äôt find him so asked me exactly where he works because she wants to meet him. I didn‚Äôt tell her). She‚Äôs also hanging around the coffee shop & pub near his work.



Should I give my widower friend a heads up about her intentions? Or openly set up a date? Which might or might not go well? He trusts me, and as a widower, he‚Äôs vulnerable. If she does ‚Äòcatch‚Äô my widower friend and it goes badly, I don‚Äôt want it to affect our relationship if he thinks I had something to do with ‚Äôsecretly‚Äô setting them up. But with what I now know about her, should I openly set up a date? I don‚Äôt want to lose my old friend, or hurt him.



To me, going to a grief session with the intentions of dating a specific person is creepy‚Ä¶as for ‚Äòstalking‚Äô my friend at his work, well. I‚Äôm clear on what to do about that one lol. And to add to this long post, even though I‚Äôm casually seeing someone and keeping busy, I still miss my husband every single day.

Solstice Scents on Instagram: 

""*NEW* Tonight with our fall release at 7 pm EST: 

**MIDNIGHT EYE** Dark Coffee, Cigar Leaf, Cacao, Carob, Tonka, Labdanum, Aged Patchouli, Fossilized Amber, Cigar Ash, Oud. 

Midnight Eye is a dark and gritty fragrance with a deep Earthy and resinous base. Opens with a bold, bitter dark roast coffee and cigar leaf lightly sweetened with a heart of cacao, carob and tonka bean absolutes. A full-bodied base of 13-year aged patchouli, sticky labdanum and fossilized amber provides an aromatic Earthy, resinous, slightly smoky dry down enhanced with a touch of cigar ash, a lightly leathery aromatic oud and blonde tobacco. A thread of the sweet gourmand notes is carried through into the dry down. Midnight Eye features a mixed media palette heavy on naturals and house tinctures. A very dark gourmand re-imagined from our previously offered natural Midnight Oil perfume. 

Midnight Eye is a portal to an analog age, existing in the somber night-shift hours. Organic cane sugar alcohol based; available in all sizes. Layers well with our natural Private Eye perfume (organic cane sugar alcohol based as well), which will also be available for this release and features a similar theme/inspiration with different notes. Private Eye is not available in spray format as the heavy cacao content may stain clothing.


**HEADMISTRESS**
Plum, Muscadine Grape Skin, Cognac, Wooden Ruler, Labdanum, Clove Bud, Paper, Oakmoss, Spicy Purple Rose

Headmistress is an elegant perfume featuring a bold top note of plum, tannic purple muscadine grape skin and soft cognac leading to a warm heart of spicy clove-forward purple rose, paper and a wooden ruler. The base features labdanum, oakmoss, sticky benzoin, subtle aged patchouli and tonka. Dry down features a spicy, sweet, warm aroma with light resins and woods on a bed of softly musky oakmoss. Contains rose de mai, Moroccan rose and Bulgarian rose to add body, but the purple rose accord is clove-forward; this is not a floral or rose focused perfume. Headmistress is sophisticated and no-nonsense with a mysterious and reserved air.

Headmistress does share some parallels to Headmaster (ex. some of the wood notes, tonka, spicy, warm and sweet palette) but it is not redundant. They each have their own mood while sharing a nod to each other.

Organic cane sugar alcohol based; available in all sizes.

So, if you are an illegal alien trying to vote? Yes, you may be able to CAST a ballot, but the ballot will be rejected when you cannot be qualified through the records check that will ensue.

He was the perfect boyfriend. He never intentionally hurt my feelings, and when he did hurt them he was always there with flowers and chocolates and sincere apologies. He always communicated his feelings to me and never shouted at me or got confrontational in any way, and always clarified that any questions about our disagreements were attempts to understand my position and not attempts to piss me off. He bought me random gifts all the time. When he was over at my flat, he was always waking me up with coffee and breakfast. He was obsessed with me and he made sure I knew it.

I like my life to be planned out perfectly and stuff not going my way stresses me out. He was always, always so laidback about everything. If he suffered a setback in his professional development, he shrugged his shoulders and said he can always try again. He struggled to meet deadlines - we‚Äôre going out at 9? He‚Äôs only just starting to get ready at 10 to 9. Christmas or someone‚Äôs birthday is tomorrow? He‚Äôs getting the gifts either on the day or the night before. It always pissed me off so much. His employment situation was weird - he was perfectly content to work temporary part-time warehouse jobs, believing that it was fine to take his time with starting a career.

We basically hit a point where we wanted to move in together, he wanted to start his career AFTER we did that (using the excuse he wanted to know where he‚Äôd be living), start thinking about getting married, getting a house together. While I could see that future, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable pursuing it with him unless he seriously changed. And I just couldn‚Äôt see him changing, and if he suffered any setbacks in starting his career I would‚Äôve been so stressed out. I thought he‚Äôd be a bad husband.

I texted him with these problems 3 months ago and said our relationship wasn‚Äôt working out. He fought it at first, saying he loved me and he‚Äôd do anything for me, and that hurt. Ultimately though he accepted the breakup and he suggested we have no contact. I told him we‚Äôd speak soon and we could still work out in a couple of months if he gets his life together.

He texted me a month and a half ago. I left him on read. I wasn‚Äôt mentally ready to respond.

I‚Äôve recently been feeling like I fucked up. I checked him out on his social media profiles and he‚Äôs landed a job in the career path he wanted to pursue, he‚Äôs going out with friends a lot, he‚Äôs moved out of his mum‚Äôs house and lives in his own house now. He looks happy. But seeing all of that, I realised I still love him and want our life together.

I asked about him to a mutual friend, a girl who used to be my best friend who I introduced him to, and she said he talked to her a lot around the time of the breakup. She called me a bitch for making him feel the way I made him feel, said something about how it‚Äôs not just the breakup or the way I handled it that I‚Äôm a bitch for but ‚Äòeverything I did during the relationship‚Äô (I have no idea what this means??), and told me to ‚Äòplease just stay away from him‚Äô.

I understand it will hurt him if I come out of nowhere, but is there any way I can prevent this or make it hurt less? I really want him back. I really, really fucked up and I want to make it right.",1,1728059833.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

We ended up staying at The Russ\*ll (admin keeps thinking this word is s\*ll and keeps removing my post) and had a great experience. I thought I would share our insight as well as some other things we enjoyed around town for anyone who may be looking for ideas.

The Russ\*ll:

Pros:

* very quiet, tucked away off a few blocks from Gallatin/Main st.
* the design is beautiful (it's a lot nicer in person than the images on their website, especially the rooms. Their website makes them look more garish than they actually are
* We loved the no-contact approach. There is no staff or front desk present, its like a airbnb hotel
* The room was very small (we had a deluxe King) but had everything we needed, especially liked the dyson hair dryer, very large shower and white noise machine
* Has its own parking area so parking was never an issue
* We also like the ethos behind the folks that own it and the ways they want to contribute to the community

Cons:

* Next time we stay we will choose the top floor, we were on the first floor and every night the folks above us came home around 2am and would not stop walking around. I'm a very light sleeper so this was a big issue for me each night
* The bed itself was comfortable but the pillows were so lumpy they seemed ancient and needed replacing.

Coffee:  
We loved both Elegy in Germantown and in East Nash (Grimeys is an awesome record shop just a block away). Our favorite though was Weak Coffee. A small little pop up located in a cool drum shop. Awesome coffee and definitely a place for the locals. Very neighborly and warm, inviting. Lots of covered outdoor seating.

Food:

* Cafe Roze for lunch, super creative dishes and nice neighborhoody vibe.
* Redheaded Stranger for lunch, more greasy spoon indulgence but delicious. Great laid back vibe.
* Audrey for dinner, Sean Brock is a staple and he did not dissapoint. It's a special occuasion place but doesnt feel stuffy or pretentious. Beautiful celebration of southern/appalacian cuisine.
* Bastion, wow this place is super special. Very small and intimate, perfect for a special date. Some of the most creative dishes I've ever had and even though it was many courses I didn't leave feeling like an absulute glutton. The staff was notably very friendly and helpful.

Additionally we enjoyed a stroll through Shelby Bottoms Nature Park and had a beautiful experience at a show at The Ryman! Overall it was a memorable first trip to Nashville, cant wait to return!",12,1728059654.0,nashville,11,0.7,False

Appliances like TVs, gaming consoles, and small kitchen appliances still draw power even when turned off but are still plugged in in the outlet.

You can consider unplugging small kitchen appliances like toasters, blenders, and coffee makers, as well as entertainment devices such as gaming consoles. Appliances like desktops and printers, along with portable fans and space heaters, can also be unplugged if they aren‚Äôt used often.

While unplugging can help reduce your electricity bill, it's not practical for larger appliances like refrigerators or washing machines. Instead, focus on smaller devices you don‚Äôt use frequently. Using power strips can make it easier to disconnect multiple devices at once. Unplugging appliances can lead to some energy savings, especially for rarely used items, but it would probably cause more hassle to you in the long term.",0,1728059555.0,Frugal,30,0.37,False

Hello, I'm 16(F) with divorced parents but I live with my mom 36(F) and stepdad 36(M), I also have a younger sister 6(F) whos severely autistic, nonverbal and diagnosed with ADHD. When I was 9 in 2017, me and my mom moved in to my stepdad's family house. The way our houses are arranged here is basically like this, there are two big houses, one is my stepdad's parents' house and other house is one house but divided into two as theres walls that block off the other part of the house, me and my family live in the smaller part of the house while my stepdad's brother with his family live in the other side. Our house has 5 rooms but it is not as spacious as you may think, we have two rooms upstairs, my room and my parents' room. then downstairs we have the living room, bathroom, and kitchen but the kitchen is narrow and in the kitchen is also a small closet where we keep our coats and shoes because theres a door that we go outside from.  
Here comes one of my problems with my home, the shower. so basically the shower is in the living room but its not in the bathroom as the bathroom only has the toilet, bathroom itself is small. But the reason why showering bothers me so much is because the only thing I'm being covered by is a wooden curtain with very narrow space in between and the curtain only reaches down a little below my knees. It is not see through if the room is dark but what really bothers me is when lights are on and i can literally see through, anyone who would be sitting on the couch faces the shower can clearly see the shower, I'm always so uncomfortable by the though like what if someone can see my private part because sometimes it feels like the curtain doesn't reach below my knees when I'm in the shower. It just makes me so uncomfortable especially because theres also a window right on the wall behind the couch and im always so paranoid someone can see me from outside. I've always told my mom how uncomfortable I feel showering and asked her so many times if she can get the blurry stickers for the glass in the shower so no one can see me and she said that no one can see through the wooden curtain when its dark and no one can see through the window because of the sun shining on the window during day. I've had to shower multiple times while my stepdad had to go outside or upstairs because i refused to shower. One time I also tried to protest to my mom to do something about the shower or else I won't shower but it backfired on me because I get dirty and I also have school so I HAVE to shower. Now keep in mind how the shower is covered by a wooden curtain thats only below my knees and how anyone on the couch can see slightly through.  
Another problem I have is my stepdad in general. At first when I moved in here, he was normal and honestly I liked him as a stepdad, but ever since my sister was born in 2018 may, for a few years everything was normal. Until she started showing signs of autism at the age of 3. Please keep in mind that knowing about my sister is very important regarding for what I'm about to say about my stepdad. Somewhere when my sister was 3 or 4, my mom decided to give her a phone and her screentime on a daily basis was hours and hours long as she was always on youtube unsupervised. She was on 'youtube' and not 'youtube kids'. I even once tried to take her phone away and deleted youtube so she would use youtube kids instead because youtube unsupervised is just neglect in my view but she threw violent tantrum and kept hitting her head against a wall, then my mom had asked me why did I take the phone away and I just told her that it's not good to give her a phone and she just asked me if I wanted to deal with her instead, I was just silent afterwards. To this day I still think that my sister developed ADHD from watching youtube everyday, specifically cocomelon because I've heard some parents speak out about cocomelon ruining their kids completely, my sister has behaved the exact same way those parents had described their child to act like with cocomelon. now for 9 months my sister refuses to be on phone as she just pushes any phone given to her away. I do wanna note that whenever my sister has a tantrum, they are violent tantrums because she usually runs up to one of us and tries to bite, hit and scratch us. She usually has tantrums when things don't go her way or when the TV is playing in general. There's a lot of things she doesn't like which I understand because she is autistic. But here comes the problem regarding my stepdad, my stepdad 2 years ago started drinking alcohol. at first it wasn't that bad as he was mostly drinking like once during weekends, maybe like 2-4 times in a month but now recently for a year now, hes been drinking so much to the point its 7+ cans a day. I'm not familiar with alcohol or anything but one can is 568 ml and it says that alcohol by volume is 5.0%. Almost every evening, hes already passed out on the couch, sleeping and snoring. Whenever I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I just feel so uncomfortable going down the stairs because I can see him just sleeping on the couch. There was one time when I went downstairs to the bathroom, I'm not sure if I saw it right but I think he had been pleasuring himself and fallen asleep, ever since i saw him like that, I couldn't stop thinking about it because I just felt kind of disturbed. I had another weird encounter when I came home from school once and it was time when my dad was on break from work so he was home. I found a weird rubber like ring in my room and company was ""durex"". I know damn well about the products that company produces and apparently when i searched about this ring, It's a ring that goes around a male private body part and vibrates, I'm not gonna go in detail what it's meant for so I'll let you imagine it but I felt very disturbed because I came to the conclusion that my stepdad had pleasured himself in my room while no one was home. I never told my mom about this because I felt too awkward and embarrassed to tell her about this and now I regret not telling her about this. There was also one sunday evening where I had to shower because I had school next day, but my dad was on the couch, sleeping. I told my mom that my stepdad is sleeping on the couch I can't just shower like that and she told me she can't do anything about it, she told me not to worry because he is sleeping after all. But because your perception is lower when you sleep. Although he was sleeping, I was still so paranoid he would be looking at my private part because his head was low enough for the wooden curtain to appear above my belly button. Whenever he's drunk, he always makes comments, hes always annoyed and antagonizes my mom. My mom and stepdad both have short temper, it feels like I'm the only person in the family who can keep their cool and I probably am the only calm person in the family. My stepdad struggles with my sister because she often has tantrums, I've heard him call her names like how shes the spawn of the devil, from hell, shithead, asshole anything to the point I can hear everything from upstairs. I told him to stop once and explained that she doesn't understand because shes still young but then he said ""then you deal with her"". He's yelled at my sister multiple times how he regrets having her and how he wishes she hits her head multiple times against the wall until shes dead (she does hit her head during her tantrums to the point the walls had a hole), My stepdad and my mom are both diagnosed with depression but my stepdad was also diagnosed with ADHD. He constantly says how hes gonna find a gun and shoot himself or how hes gonna hang himself NEAR my sister, me and my mom. My stepdad had even gone to therapy, was on meds but he wasn't allowed to take alcohol with those meds so he stopped taking the meds for the sake to continue drinking. I have atleast 20+ cans in my closet that I've hidden from him. He's switched so many jobs too because he had been caught drinking there or fired because he was absent so many times from work. Currently hes on break from work because of injured thigh and hes waiting for thigh operation but this break has worsened everything because hes drinking 10+ cans everyday. I've told my mom so many times to stop buying him alcohol but she says something like ""I can't really control what an adult man does and I don't want him to later on go drive and buy more"". There have been multiple instances where he was driving while drunk to buy more from a nearby store, he was caught once by the police and got fined for it. I honestly don't understand why my mom still hasn't divorced from him because we're all suffering from his drinking, all our money goes to the alcohol too. So much money goes to waste especially because my mom is currently the only working person in family, we are living off from my mom's paycheck, my sister's special needs donation from the government and thats it. But before I move on, I also wanted to mention that my stepdad is constantly away from home and avoids my sister, he's always hanging out at his parents' house, drinking coffee and eating food there, hes very neglectful of her.  
Last thing that bothers me is how messy my house is. My cousin 15(M) told me himself once that the reason he doesn't want to come over is because how disgustingly messy the house is, I understand him because I feel so embarrassed for having a home like this. The only clean spot in the house is my room because I keep it clean. My parents' room, there are clothes everywhere on floor, same for living room. I mean the living room has a small mattress infront of the tv where my sister sleeps (she prefers to sleep there specifically), theres another mattress upstairs in my parents' room and its just there for nothing as only clothes are there. I constantly have to look for my clothes through the huge  mountain of different clothes + socks + underwear. Everything is just always so messy, my mom cleans once every week? sometimes once every two weeks. Main reason why the house is messy is also because of my younger sister as she throws things around constantly. Now the kitchen is absolute nightmare, the counter is always so messy, theres unwashed dishes in the sink (I always put my dishes into the dishwasher), theres sometimes ROTTING FOOD on the counter to the point I always see so many fruit flies in the kitchen, theres sometimes rotting food in the fridge aswell. When the entire house is cleaned, it stays clean for only 2 days. The house is still messy even when my sister is away in the kindergarden during weekdays. My stepdad never puts his stuff away, my mom just says ""I'll do it later I'm tired right now"". I understand my mom and stepdad struggling with mental health and stuff like that but they never see how I'm also suffering from all of this. They never acknowledge how I feel simply because my mom just tells me that she knows and she can't do anything about it. I sometimes feel wrong for thinking like how they don't care anymore or anything because of how stressful their life is because of my severely autistic non verbal sister but I'm just also suffering from their neglect of the house. My stepdad has the NERVE to say how we should give away my two cats if I forget to clean the litter box for a day (I have a bad memory and I often forget things but not basic needs). My stepdad does nothing but drink his beer.  
I've never had any friends come over to my place in years because I'm so embarrassed about my drunk stepdad and messy house. I haven't gotten the chance to even throw my birthday party in years because I have no place to host it, my own home is too messy. My dream was always to host a big birthday party when I turn 15 and 16 especially but for the past 5 years, I've spent my birthday days at home in my room, I did get gifts and everything but no celebration or anything, just money in cards and tears because the sadness I feel every birthday, not being able to celebrate it with people I hold dear simply because my mom is too busy dealing with my sister and my stepdad is too busy doing nothing in the other house.

I'm just 16 (turning 17 in summer) and I shouldn't be dealing with this, i have a good relationship with my mom but I feel awkward with my stepdad, I like my stepdad too because hes genuinely nice when hes not drunk but I really don't like his drinking I'm a really nice person and I could never bring myself to tell my stepdad that i don't him if he drinks, I want to talk to my stepdad about his drinking but I just know I will be dismissed because me and my mom both talked to him about his drinking and he promised us multiple times to not drink anymore, yet he still does. I'm at complete loss and I don't think I can deal with this any longer, I just have no one to talk to about this and i don't know how to approach my mom about getting therapy because I really need someone to talk to but at the same time I don't want CPS to be called if I were to tell my therapist about the lifestyle I have at home, I love my mom and my sister.",2,1728059388.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

Recently my coffee and espresso has been driving me insane.

I have a kingrinder k6 which I use at the same grind setting once I've finally ""dialed in"" a certain coffee, same weight in beans, same pressure tamper (normcore), but then it's like I need to dial it in again?

I have a Bambino Plus so not sure if the machine is variable itself or if it's one of the other above factors.

All things staying the same, the extraction time can last anywhere between 20 seconds and 45 seconds with different flavour notes - what the hell am I doing wrong?

1fw32wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1fw32wy/my_sister/,My sister,"This is going to be a bit of a mean post, and I don‚Äôt enjoy being mean. My sister is neurodivergent, as am I. We both, as well as my parents, struggled with mental health issues. So I am not overlooking anything here. I am sharing an apartment with her because she can‚Äôt live on her own, and I essentially do every single thing for her short of wiping her ass even though she can in fact do most of these things.

She is genuinely the most useless person I‚Äôve ever met in my life. Like, she is objectively useless. She can‚Äôt do one single chore, can‚Äôt clean up after herself, can‚Äôt follow any instructions no matter how simple. She gets up, makes her iced coffee and watches anime videos on TikTok. That‚Äôs her day, all day, every day for probably the last 5 years. She will not clean up after herself. She will not help. She only takes, and doesn‚Äôt give. I am basically her caretaker for everything, despite the fact that she IS FUCKING CAPABLE OF IT. 

My entire life I‚Äôve cleaned up after her, tried to teach and help her, tried to get to know her. I‚Äôve tried to teach her music, tried to teach her how to ride a bike, tried to teach her so many things. But she can‚Äôt learn anything. There‚Äôs nothing inside her head. She genuinely has no personality, no interests, no identity. She has told me ‚Äúshe became non binary because her twitter friends were non binary and she thought it was cool.‚Äù She is a lesbian ‚Äúbecause she thinks lesbians are cool.‚Äù She likes anime ‚Äúbecause her friend thinks anime is cool.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt actually like anything. She doesn‚Äôt have her own thoughts.

She is the most predictable, boring person ever. I know everything she‚Äôs going to say, how she‚Äôs going to react to everything, what she‚Äôs going to do. I know all her behaviour patterns and how she will do anything to get out of trying new things, doing any kind of work/helping, thinking, reflection, etc. And these aren‚Äôt always simple patterns either. She will pretend to do fake activities to get out of helping with one thing, and she‚Äôll make it the right length so that by the time she‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù you‚Äôve already finished what you needed help with. She literally keeps fake notes for an online program she is doing. I see her writing her notes pretending to do school, but she literally just scribbles on the pages. Half the time she‚Äôll be looking at her laptop screen pretending to study, but you can see she has her phone on the screen and is scrolling TikTok.

She did have a job once, but she quit it after 30 minutes. I kid you not. She clocked in and then immediately called our mom to pick her up. Now she‚Äôs on disability, but she doesn‚Äôt even know anything about it herself. Despite knowing how to read, knowing how to make phone calls, she knows nothing about her own income source. She has no interest in calling them back, answering emails from them. My dad would always have to remind her until he would just end up doing it himself.

And now I‚Äôm here, being her parent again in a shared apartment where she just rots away. She isn‚Äôt stupid. She knows how to do things. But she will never. And it‚Äôs my burden to deal with it, because she doesn‚Äôt need to have burdens. She can drink her iced coffee with a cup of sugar in it, have everyone manage her life for her, watch her stupid TikTok‚Äôs all day and then walk away and lay in bed while I clean up her every move. Answer every question with yes/no/ok, avoid all responsibilities.

I know this post may make it seem like she is literally braindead and that she should be in an assisted care facility or something, but she is not brain dead. She‚Äôs perfectly healthy physically, she goes to therapy, she has all the supports she needs. She is 24, and maybe has more of a mental age of 12-13, but that‚Äôs STILL A FUCKING 13 YEAR OLD. 13 year olds STILL DO SHIT. And she does put actual effort into things that benefit her. She researches what clothes are in fashion, she spends hours doing her makeup and outfits. She spends hours arranging her 500 anime figures.

I always remember a conversation between her and my mom who since passed away. My mom was trying to get her to do a mental health worksheet that a doctor had gave her after she had been complaining she can‚Äôt do anything because of ____ disorder (she has claimed she has OCD, ODD, ADHD, PTSD, C-PTSD, BPD, DID, literally fucking everything)

‚ÄúSo honey, did you do the worksheet? You were supposed to do that a few days ago now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut this is really important for your health, sweetie. We‚Äôve all been doing a lot to help you, but you have to follow the doctors orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why didn‚Äôt you do the worksheet?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just really hard sometimes...‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt even try it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo how can it be hard if you didn‚Äôt do it, sweetie?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you want to do it right?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you understand that by not helping yourself over and over again, you are making it harder, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut honey, you‚Äôre just doing the same thing right now. If you never do anything to help yourself, you‚Äôre never going to get better.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney, don‚Äôt just say mhm. Let‚Äôs do this now together ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I think I have to give the cats food now. Be right back‚Ä¶‚Äù

She never did the worksheet. She never helped my mom with a single thing and cost her like 150k at minimum in therapy, while she was tirelessly doing everything and anything she could think of for her daughter. My mom eventually killed herself, and to be realistic my sister was a large part of it. Now I am her new parent, and it‚Äôs the same thing. That same conversation, but with every single interaction and daily activity.

Once again, I understand that people have issues. I come from the same gene pool as her. I am not neurotypical, and I have many problems of my own which make things more difficult for me. I‚Äôve been at a point where I wanted to die. I‚Äôve had all the same struggles. But unlike my sister, I was the one who everything always fell on. I have to figure everything out for myself and I have to be the logical, smart, strong one who puts up with it all. I can‚Äôt just not give a fuck about anything because if I did that, everything would collapse around me.

At least I fucking try at something, anything at all. She doesn‚Äôt. She doesn‚Äôt try at anything.

Sometimes I legitimately think about just kicking her out and cutting her off. Figure it out for your fucking self. Maybe you‚Äôll finally understand what that feels like.",1,1728058619.0,rant,0,1.0,False

I usually just make single cup pourover coffees but why do they have variable drain times? I use a kingrinder k6 with the same grind size, weigh 15g of beans, chuck the ground beans in the same filter size and the results are crazy different. All factors seem to be the same with different results. I just don't get it.

Some new beans arrived yesterday and I had literally the most beautiful cup of pourover I have ever had - balanced, sweet and tasty and couldn't wait to make it today for my wife and I. For both attempts the drain time was way slower and the flavour was much more bitter and less enjoyable.

Sometimes I leave it after I've poured all the water, sometimes I stir it - what should I be doing?

I used to ride a lot as a kid and teenager but I thought I was invincible so I wasn't worried about anything.

My wife has no problem taking the cargo bike all over town but today was my first day leaving the neighborhood and I learned a lot. I rode to a local coffee shop and it went well but I was a nervous wreck lol. It was an easy ride and basically a straight shot but you cross multiple busy intersections and there's no way around that. Luckily this is a bike-heavy town so people keep an eye out, but it just takes one bad driver that I don't hear or see coming. I can't hear cars when they drive past me and I probably wouldn't be able to hear someone calling out, so I rely almost 100% on vision and using the same skills I do when driving to stay vigilant.

I need to get rearview mirrors and probably wear something high-visibility, but what else y'all do to stay safe?
