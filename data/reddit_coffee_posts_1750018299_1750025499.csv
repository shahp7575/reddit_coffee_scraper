I’m (23f) hoping to get some insight or shared experiences that might help me understand what’s been going on with my body. I’ve seen a neurologist, but nothing definitive came out of it, he was pretty dismissive and made me feel like I was making things up. I was advised by my PCP to get a second opinion, but it’s been a couple of years and I haven’t followed up. Honestly, this might not sound like a big deal to some, but it’s changed my life and I’ve never really been the same since.

From 2019 to October 2022, I regularly smoked weed and drank alcohol without any issues. I could handle both just fine. I wasn’t a nicotine vaper, though I occasionally smoked spliffs. It was all pretty normal for me.

Then in October 2022, I went on a cruise with my (now) fiancé and while everything was totally fine during the trip (drinking & using pens), when we got home and smoked flower again, something terrifying happened.

I got extremely lightheaded, dizzy, and had this falling sensation like I was dropping outside my body over and over again. I scrambled to drink water, but my body started shaking uncontrollably. I ran to my room because I thought I was going to pass out. I could barely speak - only one-word responses like “water” or “now.” My heart was racing, I could barely breathe, and my limbs were jerking.. It felt like forever.

That episode completely traumatized me.

For a while after, it was inconsistent, some days I could smoke or drink without issue, other days I’d get hit with that same terrifying reaction and it started happening more and more. Eventually, it started happening even when I was sober. Especially if I ate something high in sodium or sugar. I cut out caffeine completely, even though I was never a heavy consumer. It was completely unpredictable.

One particularly bad episode landed me in the ER. The doctor there basically said, “Sometimes weird things happen to healthy 20-somethings. I don’t know what this is, but here’s some Xanax to help if you start to panic.”

Fast forward to today: I haven’t smoked weed since that initial episode. I know some people might say “good for you,” but it’s been a bummer. I genuinely believe in the medicinal and spiritual benefits of cannabis, and it feels like a loss not to have it in my life anymore, social aspects aside.

Even now, I get that sinking, fight-or-flight feeling in my stomach from just a sip of alcohol or coffee. It’s like my body reacts instantly and not in a good way. I won’t even touch weed because I live 40 mins from the closest ER.

Part of me wonders if now, this is PTSD from those intense, life-flashing-before-my-eyes episodes; if my body developed a severe anxiety response. It’s definitely gotten better over time, doesn’t happen as often.. but I still feel hyper-aware of my body, like I’m constantly scanning for the next crash.

My last bloodwork showed signs of possible hypothyroidism, but I’m not sure if that would’ve had anything to do with the original episodes or if it’s something that developed later.

I’ve seen a few providers (only about three), but no one has really given me answers. I’m 23 now, and while I’m not unhappy and brooding about how my life sucks because I can’t partake, it just sucks that social things I used to enjoy: a drink with friends, a little weed to relax, now make me feel like I’m dying. Especially when it never used to be that way.

It really did feel like my life changed in a single day… and I still don’t know why.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Or does anyone have any idea what this might be?

1lccgll,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1lccgll/horizon_realms_eventlabs_thoughts_and_the_future/,"Horizon Realms, Eventlabs, thoughts, and the future.","At first the Horizon games seemed to be a really cool open world festival racer. I compared those early Horizons to an open world NFS Pro Street: Pro Street had an amazing vibe that captured that Motorsport festival feeling better than any game. Horizon was a lot more sanitized but it did the same in a way.
The recent titles seem to not give a single crap about the festival side of things… we get one race per festival spot type. The main festival is tiny and the little outposts are literally parking lots. This game has became more of a free roam car collecting game than anything. No dedicated tracks really or anything… 

But horizon Realms can fix some of this. The oval and the circuit stadium tracks are amazing, truly, and a step in the right direction. Realms need to be a bigger part of the game going forward… I think some of these spots should be permanent in-map that rotate around during the seasons. For the stadium specifically: week 1 is Oval track, week 2 is circuit track, week 3 is formula drift track, and week 4 is rally cross track. Then as time goes on we can rotate in and out more stuff like off road trophy truck courses or demo derby’s or drag strips. I think we should also be able to edit and move props around in these realms for our own uses… I mean, I was making an oval in the stadium with a track course inside of the oval with the intent of making this sort of Gridlife racing festival with photo areas for groups to take pics of their cars with good lighting and the road course to combine with the oval for a Daytona style GT/LMP race as well as a FD utility… something you could load up with a huge group and just go to town in… but the atmosphere is all wrong bc they remove crowds in eventlab so the whole vibe is empty. 

If the devs aren’t gonna have balls or creativity, at least make the next horizon game with the purpose of allowing us to do so. 
Also, these realms should be open lobbies. I HATE the idea of going to cars and coffee or the oval/circuit and it’s just me or me and a couple buddies and we get bored after a while. THIS IS THE FUTURE, THESE ARE AWESOME COMMUNITY SPOTS YET THEY HAVE ZERO “COMMUNITY” ASPECTS TO THEM.

I know I had one. I know I lived here. I woke up on the grass outside this house, so I must’ve lived here. My key fits the door. The pictures inside look like me. But I look different in them. Softer. Lighter.

That’s not who I am anymore.

I keep remembering battles—three of them. We were fighting things I don’t have the words for. They weren’t monsters. They were something older than shape. We were just trying to hold the line. That’s what I remember most—holding.

The first place was a corner store. We made a wall of carts and coolers and hoped it would be enough. It wasn’t.

The second place was a coffee shop. I remember a girl with a sharp voice and steady hands. She wouldn’t let us break. She made us climb the stairs, even when some of us couldn’t breathe.

The third place was… strange. It looked like an apartment at first. Then the walls turned into wood and stone and salt. There was a kitchen fire glowing, and I smelled something warm. Bread, maybe. Or stew. A girl lit the hob and woke us gently. Her name felt like peace. I think she loved someone in the room, but it wasn’t me.

We thought we were safe there.

We weren’t.

I don’t remember how that battle ended, only that I was there—and then I wasn’t. I woke up gasping in my front yard, shirt torn, mouth full of dirt. It was still dark. Still quiet.

I went back inside and locked every door. I haven’t been able to unlock them since.

Some of the others… they’re not here.

The ones who died in that place—they didn’t wake up.

I know this because I remembered their faces when I opened my eyes, and now I can’t find them anywhere. I’ve looked. No obituaries. No missing persons. Just silence.

I’m writing this down in case someone else sees the stories. In case you’re reading those posts online and think they’re just fiction.

They’re not.

We fought together. We bled together. And if you’re one of them—one of the eleven who still breathes—I just want you to know…

I remember you. Even if I’ve forgotten everything else.

Even if I never had a name at all.

In any case, Fuji Akarui is the same OC that I used for my murder case in a Danganronpa online chatroom roleplay. If you hadn't seen it, then here it is below:


Simply put, Fuji sets a trap where she inflicts injuries onto herself before leaving evidence suggesting three suspects. Then she profiles the assailant's motives and criminal psychology, as an unwise sociopath who sloppily attacked her purely to reap the benefits (the current motive was straight up cash if you leave the killing game as blackened).


Prior to this, with the cooperation of the killing game host, she asked for there to be a timer displaying how much longer before the motive promising riches expires. She then hides her weapon at hand and uses this all to strengthen her argument that the unwise mentally ill culprit must be motivated to kill again, now that his sole motivation is going to expire soon. This is to persuade the other participants into taking her bait to become a leader-figure and accept her guidance, so that Fuji can prepare the conditions for her murder.


She intructs that everyone will stay in one room, that being the area with everyone's personal bedrooms. The three suspects, so that they can have an opportunity to prove their innocence, will be the ones to prepare everyone's meals with the clearance to exit the one area everyone is confined to. For every night, a person will be selected by Fuji to monitor outside of everyone's rooms to ensure nobody does anything shady. This would be until the timer runs out, where the assailant would most likely lose motivation to kill.


With that out of the way, Fuji makes her way to one of the suspects while everyone is going to bed, and tells them that they have been cleared from suspicion, only needing to serve the other suspects and the night monitor with coffee wait in another remote location to meet up. Which, alongside the timer, she had requested to deactivate the speakers of.


Now that most of the people that are awake at night are drugged with the coffee laced with sleeping pills, she positions their bodies in the room near where everyone is sleeping. The night monitor would be by the opened door leading to the dormitory (as if fainted from shock), and the other two suspects next to each other. Fuji would swiftly and meticulously end the life of one suspect, before waking the other one up for them to witness the corpse, before giving them the same fate.


This would trigger the BDA (Body Discovery Announcement) where everyone is sleeping, except for the last suspect in the remote room with deactivated speakers. All Fuji has to do is quickly book it to her room for an alibi. Then she has successfully framed someone with everything planned building up to it.


Firstly, she convinced everyone she was a victim and fostered their trust, before manipulating the events so well that in everyone else's eyes, the remaining suspect HAD to be the culprit. The final murder was similar in sloppiness to Fuji's assault (and the sloppiness is extremely plausible considering how difficult Fuji made for a murder to happen by confining everyone to one space, for anyone but HER, the only one unlikely to commit murder). Her profile of the culprit being a sociopath will also look quite good when the only suspect alive is trying to pin it on Fuji.

That wraps it up. This plan is primarily comprised of logical manipulation, mass manipulation, deception, and a shit ton of strategic traps.",6,1750024988.0,IntelligenceScaling,4,1.0,False

This started three days ago. At around 20:00, before I had dinner I started to feel some abdominal discomfort which soon turned into pain, centred on the lower right side of my abdomen.

Over an hour after the pain started I went to the nearest hospital but between the trip and the long wait by the time I was seen a couple of hours later the pain was mostly gone. The doctor took my vitals and felt my abdomen but said it was probably just gas and sent me home.

Then last night, a couple of hours after dinner it started again. Thankfully not as much pain, but I was still uncomfortable for around two hours. I took some over the counter medication for bloating about an hour after it started.

Tonight it started again, despite me still being on the medication. Again not as bad as that first night but still enough that I can’t sleep. I had also noticed some slight discomfort during the day but nothing too out of the ordinary.

I was able to schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist but it’s only in a few days. 

Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help? Could the pain be caused by something other than gas? Is there anything I should bring up to the doctor or ask other than what’s in this post?

I went to talk to my coop advisor abt it and he said that i can’t work past my working hours without compensation/pay. My boss for some reason after that without knowing i talked to my advisor treated me to coffee and said I can have regular work hours out of the blue…. so things were ok for a while esp since i told her im taking 2 courses during the summer at the same time.

Fast forwards, now it’s been over a month and she’s being weird again. Like she’s asking for my entire summer schedule with my course quizzes and assessment dates so she can have more visibility bc apparently she’s been “working around my schedule” and “would like to have more visibility” when all my quizzes i do are after work hours… so it doesn’t affect her? and she’s like oh we weren’t made aware of this coursework commitment before u started… but it’s after work hours? like am i wrong or does this not really concern her? I asked her if i could work from home on the day of my midterm and she approved before but now she’s saying i have to “make up for that time”. like i am there and i get all my work done everyday but my after work schedule wouldnt concern her, nor would she have to work around it right? I genuinely don’t get why she needs to have a schedule of what I do after work… all in all, i don’t know what to make from this, and she probably will want to discuss with me on monday, so id really appreciate some advice. thanks!

Please know I'm not a pearl clutcher. I was a club kid in the 80s and lament that the Michael Todd room (and the Palladium itself), Florent, and Coffee Shop are all long gone. I've done coke on the floor of the vestibules of buildings on St Marks at 430am, and more tabs of ecstasy than I can count.

But this is different somehow.

1lcc4pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1lcc4pw/mountain_town_opinions/,mountain town opinions,"sorry for all the posts about moving, but we are trying to narrow down our options! heres an update: 

  
My boyfriend and I (we’re both 22) are planning a move away from our home in North Dakota, and we’re hoping to find a small town that really aligns with our lifestyle and values. We're huge nature lovers — especially drawn to areas like the Blue Ridge Parkway. When we visited Brevard, NC, we completely fell in love with the town and the people. The vibe there felt like *exactly* what we're looking for: relaxed, community-oriented, and surrounded by nature. Unfortunately, the housing and job market there seems tough unless you're doing seasonal work, so we’re expanding our search a bit.

Here’s what we’re hoping to find:

* A town under 50,000 people (give or take), ideally within about an hour’s drive of a larger city (think Brevard to Asheville)
* A walkable downtown with local shops and a good atmosphere for young people
* Plenty of local coffee shops (not just chains — we plan to work in coffee!)
* Farmers markets and access to natural/organic groceries
* Affordable rent (under $1,500/month for a 1 bed — we’re looking on Craigslist and Facebook mostly)
* Snow is fine — we’re just hoping to escape the *multiple feet* we’re used to in North Dakota
* A welcoming, laid-back, nature-loving community

We're open to either mountain or beach towns, but are mainly drawn to places that have a slower pace of life, easy access to the outdoors, and a warm sense of community. We don’t need a booming job market — we’re mostly just looking for a fresh start and a better day-to-day life.

Here are some of the towns currently on our list:

* **Christiansburg, VA**
* **Lexington, VA**
* **Franklin, NC**
* **Blowing Rock, NC**
* **Staunton, VA**
* **Radford, VA**
* **Boone, NC**
* **Maggie Valley, NC**
* **Bryson City, NC**
* **Woodstock, NY (leaning no to how expensive it is)**
* **Ithaca, NY (may be to North, but the town looks lovely)**

If you’ve lived in, visited, or know anything about these towns — we’d love to hear your thoughts! Or if there’s another place that sounds like it might be a better fit for us based on everything above, we’re all ears. Thanks in advance!",4,1750024408.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,1.0,False

A few weeks ago I (25f) have made plans to attend a cycling event with a new friend of mine that I had a chance to meet through reddit (yay!) As the date of the event was approaching she asked me if it would be okay for her male friend to join us as he is also interested and has been active in the cycling community for a while. I said of course, the more people the better :)

So the day came and we met the three of us.  Because I am a complete beginner my pace is a bit slower but he was very kind and slowed down so I wouldn’t be left out of the group. We started chatting and getting to know each other a little and I had a really good feeling about him. After this we wanted to go to get a coffee at a local coffe shop but because it was closed and relatively late, the three of us agreed we would go next time. 

As I said I had a good feeling about him and would like to get to know him better, but we never exchanged socials. Should I ask for his? Normally I am pretty proactive and have no issues showing interest first if I like someone, however it doesn’t always work out if I do. Should I leave it be?

I (25F) have a younger sister named Juliet (22F) and we used to be close. When we were kids, we used to play dress up games where we would be strong princesses who would save each other. We both look different (I have wavy black hair and brown eyes, Juliet had curly blonde hair and green eyes) but we are seen as the beautiful girls of the family. As we grew older, we had different interests and different friend groups but we still bonded over the princess games we used to play. She’s an extrovert and I’m an introvert. We only had two mutual friends. She leaned more towards literature and art while I leaned more towards sciences. Despite these changes over the years though I had always loved her because she was my sister. And this is why what she did hurts so much.

Four years ago, back in my junior year of college, I met my now ex boyfriend, Hugo (24M), who was a sophomore at the time. Hugo was an incredible guy. He seemed kind and we understood each other. He was funny and he loved listening to me ramble about the different things I’ve learned about in science, despite learning heavily into literature and arts. Four months after we started to date, I introduced Hugo to my family. My father (57M) and Hugo immediately got along because of their shared love of golfing. My mother (55F) always mentioned that he was sweet and kind. To my absolutely shock, the usually bubbly and vivacious Juliet was shy when he came around and she didn’t try to speak with him. I immediately chalked it up to nerves. I talked to her about it and she confirmed it with me. I invited Juliet to the alcohol-free bar next to our college so she could get to know Hugo and things hit it off between them. They both grew to geek out about their shared interests in literature. They began to hang out privately without me being around and they let me know where they were at all times. I trusted them. They acted the way the friends in my circle acted like and they never behaved in ways which indicated romantic feelings. The most that ever occur was that they were both playful but they knew their limits. It wasn’t that big of a deal. 

*Or, so I thought.*

I didn’t notice it at the time but, last Christmas, Hugo and I came to our family’s house to spend the holiday with them and Juliet was there. By this point, Hugo and I had lived together and he worked remotely while I was going to medical school. At the time, she was a senior in college and she had recently turned 22. She was looking into housings for herself and her best friend. I noticed that Juliet and Hugo were behaving very friendly to each other but, at the time, I assumed that they were closer now. Once again, nothing wrong happened. I never thought anything of it.

It was, until, my 25th birthday, 3 weeks ago. I had came home earlier from work because I had gotten a headache. I didn’t expect to see Juliet’s car parked outside the house but I assumed that she was helping Hugo work on something for my birthday. I walked past the bedroom and heard skin slapping against each other, the bed creaking, and moaning. I burst the door open and I saw Juliet riding Hugo, his hands gripping her hips. I froze. I never expected that two of my most beloved people in the world would betray me on my birthday as well. They immediately broke apart and tried to apologise to me, claiming that it was a cause of emotions running high. Juliet’s boyfriend had recently broken up with her and Hugo wanted to comfort her. I saw that they didn’t use a condom as well. Juliet quietly left while I was screaming at Hugo. I couldn’t believe that he would cheat on me like that and with my sister?? 

He confessed that, ever since they first spent time together at the alcohol-free bar, he had always felt a spark between her. He never thought of her in that way. It was until her 21st birthday when she first had a drink for the first time. While I was at work, they spent time together and they slept together for the first time. They didn’t want anything else to happen but he found himself thinking about her whenever he was feeling down. They talked about that night and they slept together again. They started to have an affair. It had occurred for over a year. I broke up with him and he left the house.

I couldn’t believe that Juliet would do that to me, especially when we were so close. I had cried a lot because of this. She tried to apologise to me for what happened and that she promised that she would avoid him at all costs. I didn’t care but I pretended to so she would listen to me. I never told my parents about this as I was unsure. I just wanted to get revenge. And that’s what happened. One morning, before she went to work, she came over to my house so she could try to mend things with me. I just said what she wanted to hear and, while she wasn’t looking, I put crushed laxatives in her coffee. She left.

It wasn’t until my phone blew up with messages from Juliet and our parents about what I had done. The laxatives caused her to shit a lot during a job interview and embarrass herself in front of him. I calmly told my parents about me catching her and my ex boyfriend sleeping together, to which they called me a liar. I had heard that Hugo went to comfort Juliet about this incident. I’m still so livid.

Our friends are divided: some saying that it was justifiable and that I did nothing wrong. Some saying that, while they believe that I was cheated on and that Hugo and Juliet were wrong for it, I went too far. Others are calling me a liar and that I’m saying that I was completely in the wrong. All of those are getting to me but am I truly the asshole for this? I still feel horrible about everything.",3,1750024089.0,AmITheAngel,1,1.0,False
1lcc0e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1lcc0e3/how_would_you_react_fathers_day_rant/,How would you react? (Father’s Day rant),"Apologies in advance for the long post:

For some background; my husband has always been the hardest person to surprise/shop for. Whatever he wants, he buys for himself. Rarely ever will he say something he wants without already planning to buy or having bought it. I’m the type of person where I try to surprise people with things they really want, things they mention in passing when they think no one is paying attention. That’s what I’ve always tried to do for him, every holiday and very rarely am I successful. My husband, however just takes me to the store and asks me what I want and he’ll buy it right then and there in front of me. Except for Christmas it’s a little more secretive and he’ll surprise me with something. I’m also a sahm and my husband is in the army, idk if that adds any context here but I wanted to mention it. 

How my Mother’s Day went: 
Leading up to Mother’s Day I said I really want to get family portraits done (we’re military and currently stationed in Alaska about to get out and move home so I want to commemorate our time here and have some nice pictures). I booked the photographer myself and it’s not until next weekend that we’re actually getting the pictures done so I hardly consider it a gift. I also hinted around wanting a nicer water bottle (okay a Stanley, I’m one of the few women in the world who didn’t have one lol) my husband didn’t get the hints at all and finally the day before Mother’s Day he asked what I wanted and I said a Stanley, we went to target together and bought it. On Mother’s Day, I woke up and it was like any other day. I made breakfast for myself and the kids, my husband got up and asked if I wanted a coffee and I got kind of excited because I thought he was going out to get coffee and he explained “I’m not going out to get anything I’m just asking if you want me to make you one” so I said okay. Then he asked what I wanted to do, and I thought long and hard about it looking up what was free in the area. We have a local reindeer farm that my husband isn’t the biggest fan of because of the crowds (ptsd) but since it was my day I said I wanted to go there. He immediately got SO pissed off and said “are you serious right now?! I don’t want to go all the way out there and we don’t even have enough gas in the car for that right now.” So I immediately got quiet, because I knew ultimately it wasn’t about anything other than he didn’t want to do it, after asking ME what I wanted to do. He cleaned the house for me while I watched the kids. I had an attitude the rest of the day, we fought on and off I told him he was being a jerk. At the end of the day, when he realized this wasn’t gonna blow over he took the kids out and bought me a necklace and some perfume and a card. He came home and apologized for ruining the day, I forgave him because he seemed sincere. 

Father’s Day:
I initially wanted to get him Pokémon cards, he’s been talking non stop about the new release of them but they’re sold out everywhere so I had to come up with a back up plan. I woke up early this morning and got the kids out the door before my husband woke up. I went and got him his favorite cheesecake and letters to spell out “happy Father’s Day” on top, a Stanley because he’s been saying he’s a little jealous of mine, a card, and then I got him some new crocs because he’s been saying his are getting a gross smell lol. All of this took me 3 different stores and 2 hours. Then on the way home, I stopped and got his favorite breakfast sandwich and a coffee. He was awake when I got home, but he stayed out of the kitchen so I could put everything in a bag and sign his card. He opened it and immediately I could tell he wasn’t impressed. He gave me a hug and was quiet for about 10 minutes until I asked if I made his day, even a little. He said “yea, I guess thanks for breakfast..it’s the thought that counts.” Then he proceeded to make comments over the next hour, saying “wow I feel like an adult on Christmas I got shoes and a water bottle you just forgot the socks.” And he told me he thought I was out getting him Pokémon cards or something REALLY special, and I said I tried but they were all sold out. He asked me where I went, and why I didn’t go here and why I didn’t ask them to check the back blah blah blah. Then he said “I’m just giving you back what you gave me on Mother’s Day” and tried to do an impression of me saying “oh I didn’t want that gift I wanted something else.” So COMPLETELY misconstruing the argument we had to justify his narrative. He kept saying he was just joking, but it didn’t feel that way. I told him I’m sorry I’m so shitty and getting him gifts and that I hoped one day I’d be able to get him something that he would actually like. I did make sure to bring up the fact that the argument we had on Mother’s Day was NOT about me not appreciating a gift, and that if it wasn’t for our argument he wouldn’t have gone out and surprised me with anything. He said he knows all of that. 

Now he’s acting like his normal self, and I’m trying SO hard not to be mad at him for this because I don’t want to argue on Father’s Day like we just did a month ago. But I can’t help but feel completely unappreciated. I was so excited to get home and show him all of the things I went out of my way to do for him. And yea, it wasn’t an expensive necklace or hard to find Pokémon cards but it still cost over $100 all together and 2 hours of my day with 2 under 2 crying the entire time I was trying to get it all done. I just wish he could be grateful for my efforts, and stop being so disappointed by the gifts I get him because they’re not 100% exactly what he wanted. 

Side tidbit I also want to add:
For his birthday 2 months ago, our family had covid. I especially had the worst of it that day, and I had no energy to do anything special for him. I still managed to get him concert tickets to his favorite country artist, and I got him a cheap cake delivered to our house. He was slightly excited, but he said he was a little disappointed because he thought I got him tickets to see a patriots game. ITS ALWAYS SOMETHING. I can never just get a THANK YOU. There always has to be some kind of disappointment, something I missed or didn’t do right. ",5,1750024086.0,Mommit,4,1.0,False

Every plant that gets touched by this greatness has an extremely noticeable reaction to it over the following day or two. They look so insanely healthy and immediately put on a growth spurt. It blows my mind every time it happens. This can't be just me right? It's a transformative effect.

1lcbws1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1lcbws1/feeling_better_after_six_years_from_foam_rolling/,Feeling better after six years from foam rolling by abdomen,"I'll start with some background. I have been dealing with pelvic floor issues since I was 21. It started during a very stressful (but fun) period in my life where I noticed I would have issues with incomplete bowel movements. Basically endless wiping. This caused my skin to feel irritated and led me down the completely wrong path initially. I went to multiple separate doctors who just noticed the skin was irritated and gave me random creams that never did anything. So unhelpful, I remember one making a joke that I was in perfect health and must have sat on something >:(

At some point I realized it must be pelvic floor related, but here are all the things I've tried:

- Diet changes. More fibre, less fibre, no caffeine, no dairy, any number of random supplements
- Dilation
- Pelvic wand
- Going to the gym and doing squats/deadlifts/kettlebell swings. I figured weak glutes might be part of my issue but if anything this just made things far worse. Felt like everything just got way more clamped down.
- Went to a pelvic floor physio. I didn't find this very useful if I'm honest, she said my pelvic floor seemed fine and prescribed me a list of basic breathing exercises that didn't help. One thing that was interesting is that she said my attempt at ""pushing"" was very weak. Although she said the breathing exercises would help with that which they didn't seem to.
- Antidepressants - unrelated to my PF but I'm a very anxious person so I thought this might help in someway. Didn't help my mental health or my pelvic floor.

Anyway, around a month ago I saw some guy on here linking to a Kelly Starrett ""gut smash"" video and I thought I'd give it a go. 

[Gut smash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k2p7ZUvX7k)

Basically I just lay on a foam roller for 15 minutes. It was very painful the first time but now my abdomen has loosened up a lot and it doesn't really hurt that much. I noticed feeling very calm afterwards and even felt I slept better. Next morning, I had a noticeably more complete bowel movement. I've started to foam rolling my obliques too and feel that is also helping.

So my routine now is do this before bed, have a coffee and something to eat the next morning and I'll be able to have a bowel movement. Small victory but previously I was miserable, feeling bloated and constipated all the time. I wish I could be fully recovered and not have to worry about all this but for the first time in years I think I'm on the right path. If I miss my ""window"" of an hour or two after waking, or I don't have coffee... it's not happening. So still more to work on.

Now I'm not a physio but if I had to speculate about why this might be helping me...I noticed that I clench my jaw a lot (unfortunately also have bruxism and have to wear a night guard) due to anxiety. Lately I realized that I also clench my abdominals habitually and suck my stomach in. No idea on the mechanism but I'm guessing this has screwed up my pelvic floor over time. I think it's also made my breathing shallower than it should be, or made me a bit of a chest breather. After foam rolling the shit out of stomach I notice by ribs expand a lot more and I can breathe more deeply. I recommend getting high and trying to notice all this, for some reason it's easier to see that way.

Anatomically I also notice that my side ribs are very visible and I'm able to dig all 5 fingers up underneath my bottom ribs. I'm fairly skinny but I gather this isn't 100% normal. My next step is going to be finding a good physio that has some insight into how all this links together (if anyone knows someone in Toronto lmk).

1lcbwnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lcbwnk/aita_for_lighting_a_cigarette_on_a_café_patio_and/,AITA for lighting a cigarette on a café patio and standing my ground when my friend and girlfriend told me not to?,"So this weekend my girlfriend and I stayed with a friend (let’s call her Emi) who invited us to her apartment in Cleveland, we drove 2 hours to be there, I had a good time for the most part, but things went south over what might seem like a small issue, a cigarette, but there’s more context.

**Day 1: The ""Buddy"" Lecture**  
Earlier in the weekend, Emi and I had a disagreement while playing a game similar to Cards Against Humanity, she was explaining why a certain meme card was funny, and I just didn’t find it funny, I tried to be polite at first and said, “I get it,” multiple times, but she kept insisting, explaining the joke over and over again, I was getting worn out and said I just didn’t find it funny, she noticed I was irritated and started asking if I was okay, not once, but around twenty times, I kept saying I was fine.

Eventually I admitted I was annoyed, mostly because she wouldn’t stop asking and it felt like she wanted me to change my answer, that’s what really got to me, it felt like she didn’t believe me when I said I was fine, and it made me feel like I had to manage her anxiety on top of my own boundaries.

She took that opportunity to bring up something from months ago when she called me “buddy,” and I told her it made me uncomfortable, I didn’t make a huge deal out of it at the time, but she spiraled into anxiety and over-apologized. I had initially told her that I wanted to leave to smoke a cigarette as I was fuming at that point (because of her constant bickering and not because of her being high and overexplaining a non-funny meme - that was just mildly irritating and not worth my time), yet she pulled me to the kitchen ignoring my cues, and start giving me a lecture.

She had given me a lecture about how I should always tell her immediately if something makes me uncomfortable. I did not want to talk right now so I just listened to her and said OKAY then left. Later that night, I asked her to go on a walk with me and gave her my honest opinion about her actions that day, after having distanced myself and gotten clarity: I told her straight up that her lecture was unfounded, because that’s exactly what I did, I told her in the moment that I wasn’t okay, that she was overexplaining and on top of that showing me she does not trust by asking me like 10 times if I was okay or not. I told her it was exhausting that I got a lecture whose main takeaway is ""Be honest, and tell me if I'm bothering"" as if that was not exactly what I did. She said she understood now that asking repeatedly means she doesn’t believe me, and that she’d work on only asking once. I also clarified I am not the kind of person to hold back and will tell her if she makes me uncomfortable. I do not like half-truths myself just to keep the peace and always preferred honesty and directness. However, her making a big deal out of a small and miniscule conflict like this makes it really hard for me to be honest and direct with her. Eitherway, she did not argue with me for long and said she was sorry she made me feel that way and it felt like that was the end of it.

**Day 2: The Patio Incident**  
The next morning, we made plans to go get coffee, my girlfriend and I told Emi the day before that cigarettes and coffee is my go-to breakfast, she picked a café she liked, but when we got there, the patio had several no-smoking signs, I was a little annoyed but figured it probably wouldn’t be enforced, especially since there was only one other customer seated far away.

For context, both Emi and my girlfriend are smokers too, so it’s not like they were bothered by the smoke itself, if that were the issue, I would’ve either left the patio or asked them to move inside, the way I see it, this wasn’t about smoke, it was about control.

I pulled out my cigarette, and Emi pointed out the sign and said not to smoke, I said I’d move to another table a bit away and not sit with them while I smoked, I figured that was a decent compromise, I wasn’t breaking any laws, and I’d remove any association with them, but Emi and my girlfriend stood up and came over, saying they were still uncomfortable and that I needed to smoke off the patio entirely, my girlfriend even threatened to put out the cigarette if I lit it, I lit it anyway because that comment triggered me. I felt like I was being treated like a child and that I had to give up any and all autonomy if their comfort is ever threatened.

At that point, they kept pestering me until I gave in and walked away to finish it elsewhere, I ended up pouring out my coffee in frustration, when I came back, I went inside and asked the staff if it was okay to smoke on the patio, they said they didn’t care at all, I told Emi this, and she still insisted I was being inconsiderate and disrespectful.

On the way back to her place, things escalated further, she brought up the previous night’s conversation and said if I want to be her friend, I have to accommodate her feelings, she called me immature.

My girlfriend later said she backed Emi because she saw Emi was visibly uncomfortable, not because she feared her or was trying to take sides, fair enough, but I still feel like the situation got blown way out of proportion, I wasn’t trying to disrespect anyone, I made compromises, I moved tables, I even caved in the end and walked away, it just felt like they didn’t trust me to make my own decisions, even in a public place.

When we got back to Emi’s, she didn’t say goodbye to me and ignored my texts asking if she could come out so I could thank her for hosting, later, she texted my girlfriend saying, “I really hope you’re okay. Text me if you need anything.” which is the one thing that really got to me out of all of this.

I currently stay in one bedroom and use one of the other bedrooms as a shared office. The room will be available August 1st, but move-in date is negotiable as the lease is technically through August 31st.

The apartment is privately owned and the landlords live downstairs. They are extremely responsive to any issues and do a great job keeping up the building.

Laundry is free in the basement. We even have our own washer and dryer.

Kitchen has a dishwasher and ample counter space. There's also a walk-in pantry. We have a large dining room area as well as a living room.

There are radiators in every room. Window A/C units are currently placed in the office and dining room, so you would only be responsible for installing one in your bedroom.

Internet, electricity, and cooking gas would be split between the two of us, usually around $140 each. I also sometimes hire a cleaning service and split it with my current housemate. I would be open to continue doing so.

Most of the apartment is already furnished. I have a dining table with chairs, 2 couches, a TV, a coffee table, and shelving that you would be welcome to use.

There are two storage closets in common areas. Your bedroom has another closet. There is also space in the basement for extra storage if needed.

Street parking is easy, plentiful, and does not require a permit. We have a lovely back patio with a garden.

About me:
I am a 32 year old man that works as a registered nurse. I'm out of the house M-F from around 7am-6pm.
After work I usually like to watch TV or get on video calls with friends if I am at home.
On weekends I like to occasionally have a friend over to watch a movie, or I'll be out doing my own thing.
I have two cats. One is extremely friendly, the other will mostly ignore you.
I am sober and would ask that alcohol not be stored in common areas.
I am open to hanging out together or just peacefully existing in the same space.

It started with people talking to thin air.

Not just the occasional homeless guy muttering to himself under a bridge. No, this was different. I’m talking clean-cut businessmen stopping on the sidewalk to have what looked like full-blown conversations with empty space. Mothers holding their kids with one hand and gesturing to no one with the other. My own friends, talking to people I couldn’t see.

I live in a busy city. Tall buildings. Constant noise. Crowded trains. The kind of place where you can disappear in a crowd—and I usually liked it that way.

But lately, I felt like the one who had disappeared.


The first time it really hit me was during coffee with my friend Isaac. We were sitting outside a café. I was mid-sentence, telling him about work, when he looked over my shoulder and smiled.

“Oh, hey,” he said.

I turned around.

No one.

I chuckled, confused. “Who are you talking to?”

His face shifted. Not confused—concerned.

“You didn’t see her?” he asked. “She was right behind you. In the red coat. She waved at me.”

“There’s no one there,” I said, laughing again, but quieter this time.

He stared at me for a moment too long.

“You’re messing with me, right?”

He dropped it, but something had shifted between us. The conversation died down fast. He checked his phone. Said he had to meet someone. Walked away a little too quickly.

I sat there for a while, wondering if I was the butt of some elaborate joke.

But then it kept happening.

People all over the city were seeing things. Talking to… people? Entities? I couldn’t tell. They waved at people who weren’t there. Held elevator doors open for empty air. Laughed at jokes I didn’t hear.

I started paying attention on the subway. One woman nodded at a seat across from her and said, “I agree. It’s worse at night.”
No one sat there. Nothing but an empty spot and a few candy wrappers.

A man on the sidewalk tilted his head and whispered, “You always say that,” then started chuckling.
To nothing.

Every time I asked someone what they were doing, they looked at me like I was crazy.

“They were right there,” they’d say.
“Didn’t you feel them?”
“They’re always around now.”


I went to a doctor. Then a therapist. Then another doctor.

They said I was normal. Clean mental health record. Perfect eyesight. No neurological issues.

Except I was the only one who couldn’t see them.


Then it started with my friend group.

I’d show up at the bar, and someone would already be deep in conversation—except the other person wasn’t there.

They made room at the table. Spoke to someone between them.

“Dude,” I said one night, “who are you talking to?”

They all just… stared.

“You don’t see her?” my friend whispered.

“No. There’s no one there.”

They left not long after that. One by one, they stopped texting back. Ghosted me like I’d insulted their imaginary friends.


I tried to ignore it. But the city didn’t make that easy.

One morning I stepped onto a crosswalk and a man yanked me back.

“What the hell?” I shouted.

He pointed across the road. “You almost walked right through her.”

“There’s nobody there!” I screamed.

He looked at me like I was a disease. “You people are dangerous.”

You people.


At some point, I realized I was the only one who couldn’t see them.

Children waved at empty corners. Dogs barked at shadows that weren’t there. Whole bus stops stood quietly, respectfully silent, as someone walked by with nothing beside them—except to everyone else, that “nothing” was someone.

I stopped leaving my apartment.


I live on the 14th floor of a gray high-rise. Can barely hear the city from up here, and even that’s been quieter lately. I order groceries online. Avoid calls. The one time I answered the door, the delivery guy refused to cross the threshold.

“They’re standing behind you,” he mumbled.

Slammed the door and ran.

I tried to record myself. Put my phone in every corner of the apartment. Nothing ever shows. Not on video. Not in photos. Just me, pacing like a madman.

But people say they’re here. Even when I’m alone.

Especially then.


A few nights ago, I heard knocking.

Three slow knocks on the inside of my closet door.

I stood there for a long time, frozen. I opened it.

Empty.

But when I closed it, there was a handprint on the mirror behind me. Not mine. Smaller. Wrong angle.

Like someone had pressed their palm against the back of the glass.


I still can’t see them.

But I feel them now.

Sometimes, just before I fall asleep, I get that static buzz in my ears. The one that makes your jaw clench and your skin crawl. Sometimes I hear my name being whispered from the hallway, even when I haven’t spoken to anyone in days.

And sometimes, just sometimes, I see people on the street stop and point up at my window.

They never wave.

They just… smile.


Last night, I couldn’t move.

Sleep paralysis? Maybe.

I felt something climb into bed beside me. I couldn’t see it. I couldn’t turn my head. But I felt the pressure. The cold. Something breathing near my ear.

And then a voice—raspy, wet, wrong—whispered:

“You’re the last one.”


When I woke up, my apartment looked… different.

My plants were dead. Every mirror was cracked. The hallway lights flickered when I stepped into them.

And people on the street no longer looked at me with pity.

Now, they look at me with fear.

I think they’re visible now.

Not to me—but through me.

I went down to the lobby this morning. The doorman flinched when he saw me. Wouldn’t meet my eyes.

“You shouldn’t be outside,” he said. “They’re using you now.”

Using me for what?

He wouldn’t say.

I don’t know how this ends. But I think it’s started.

Last time I looked in the mirror, I saw movement.

Not my reflection—something behind my reflection.

And this time… I almost saw a face.

Not mine.

Grinning.

So, if you see someone walking down the street, looking lost, pale, confused—talk to them. Ask them if they’ve noticed anything strange lately.

If they look at you and say:

“What are you talking about? There’s no one there.”

Walk away.

Because they’re next.

And when they finally see them…

I feel like he was behaved at the boys night because he knows that scenes get replayed at awards night etcc, but he's being completely dishonest with toni and is baso lying to her when all she asked for was honesty: and even when she said that at the fire pit he looked so easy.



Also I love tony for putting nonsense Yapper (Yasmine) in her place like go girl and hence do NOT want her to level, Toni is deffo not getting enough love! Kinda feel like Connor/Conor/Konner/Knnor used her as a placeholder.",24,1750022743.0,LoveIslandTV,12,0.93,False
1lcbgk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1lcbgk7/vyvanse_and_coffee/,Vyvanse and Coffee,"Hi everyone,

I've been taking 60mg of Vyvanse for a few months, and recently, whenever I drink coffee I end up feeling a deep and inescapable sense of panic and anxiety. 

I don't remember having this reaction with lower doses or other prescription medications, and I'm unsure if Vyvanse is definitely the cause. Has anyone else experienced similar effects when combining Vyvanse with coffee or caffeine? Have any of you had to give up coffee entirely? Even though these episodes don't happen every time I drink a cup of coffee, I feel they've definitely become more intense lately.

I have an appointment tomorrow to discuss my medications, and there's talk of switching me to Adderall ER. I'm quite worried about the ""crash and burn"" effects that Adderall users often talk about, but I'm also uncertain about continuing Vyvanse. The first week was incredible and I felt clearer and more motivated than I had for a long time before. Unfortunately, those effects and my feelings of clarity disappeared fairly quickly.

I've tried so many medications already, and I'm really unsure about what to do next and I wonder if I should try reducing my caffeine intake before switching to another medication. I really just don’t know what to do anymore.

Sorry if any of this is vague or confusing. I’ve never spoken about my medications online and am having a hard time describing it all.",1,1750022619.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

And tbh?? A lot better than expected. 

Got to hear the birds chirp, got to take in the sunrise while sipping my coffee, and best of all was I didn’t have to worry about sunscreen. It was just a relaxing morning.

He has always been friendly but it has been getting... weird lately.

It started small. He complimented my hair, asked about my classes, things like that. Then he started waiting until I was alone to talk to me. Last week he asked me personal questions, like where I lived and if I had a boyfriend. I was trying to keep it professional and he just kept pushing it.

Yesterday He came in during my closing shift, and I was completely alone. He trapped me behind the counter, and had his hand on my waist while asking if I wanted to ""grab dinner sometime."" I literally froze.

After he left, I was shaking. I called my manager to tell her what happened and she said she would handle it.

Today I learned apparently one of my coworkers recognized him. I guess he's a professor at my university. She told the head of his department about what this man was doing. Apparently, he is now under some type of investigation.

Now I think that I  maybe overreacted and that I should have more directly told him to back off as an alternative first. I may have ruined his career over what someone might think was a misinterpretation of the situation.

My sister is 28 about to be 30 and she always assumes shit I do. I like the last of us and I wanted to play the 2nd. I paid the cd of the 2nd part with my own money and I don’t have a ps5 so I wanted to play in my sister’s room so she let me, all though I only stole something from her and that’s literally sugar packets. And I get it, I shouldn’t have done that.

But now she keeps assuming I steal stuff from her bedroom, a few months ago we got brownies and I took the last piece for tomorrow when I video game cause I like eating and video gaming, so while I was playing I had coffee and brownie a piece, and then my sister came in, she grabs the brownie bucket she had looks inside and goes, “Melly did you take a brownie from me?” I told her no and explained how I got the brownie that I had rn from yesterday she was skeptic then said “I’m not saying that u stole the brownie but when you’re in my room don’t take anything without asking” I just nodded and then she opened the other bucket that’s supposed to have cookies inside? And it was empty when she suddenly glares at me and says “you stole it right?” And I said no cause I didn’t even fucking realized it was there, she got mad at me and scolded me saying that her words always goes to trash and she leaves. My mood of playing was gone and I felt like shit. I didn’t do anything and she always accuses and scolds. After that I never dared to play with her ever. 

And she keeps getting mad easily, like, I can’t even ask her something without her getting pissed, I have issues with eating and they don’t understand how it affects me. She’s keto meaning she eats less food and their food is what i can eat, normally I eat it at dinner cause the cook makes us pizza or macaroni and being honest, I hate it, the pizza is stale and the macaroni just, the texture is bad and makes me gag sometimes, a lot of food I can’t eat due to the surgery and so I eat with my mom sometimes cause her and my sister r doing keto, but my sister starts getting mad at me saying “you can eat that!” So out of anger I ate macaroni then threw up after dinner. 

Another encounter is when she doesn’t understand that I hate people touching me. My brother touched my back and I get pissed, I yell at him and scolded him for poking my back, my sister gets mad and says “I wanna talk to u” she starts scolding me and that bs and I got pissed and started crying and she acted like she was the victim and tried giving me advice but I just got more pissed, and now I don’t wanna play or be near her anymore, she’s fucking crazy she just gets mad very fast. 

Remember when she said “if u need the sugar packets just ask me?” Today I did and she went insane “I don’t get why u need them when u can easily use sugar” well sorry that the sugar was infested with ants and one fucking packet won’t make u suffocate.

She also does stuff we don’t want her to do, one time she came in while I was playing on my vr and she asks me “do u have a pen/pencil?” I thought I didn’t cause before I played I was looking for a pen to study and didn’t find any so I said “no?” And this bitch fucking snooped through my stuff and pulled out a pen😭? Then she scolded me and I just looked at her like …”bitch?”.

Shes a nerve wrecking mf, and she has a cat that gave the whole family ring worm, and I’m the most one with it, it’s so itchy, and so annoying, and she keeps getting mad saying “my cat doesn’t have a disease” and whatever.

Her cat gave me 43 spots even if I do like her cat but the ring worms itch badly and spreads like, crazy and it even bleeds. ",1,1750022041.0,TeenVent,0,1.0,False

When we lock eyes I get butterflies in my stomach and it feels like electricity between us. I look away but when I look back she is still staring. I think people at church are starting to notice us staring at each other. Ughh. 

But here’s the problem. She is in her 20s and I’m in my 40s. Her and I are some of the only single people at my church but still I don’t know how she would really react if I actually pursued her romantically. I am certain that she likes me however our age gap could freak her out (it freaks me out) and she could reject me because of how it looks. There’s already lots of gossip at my church. I think people are already gossiping that there’s something going on between me and this woman. 

I really don’t know what to do here because I have prayed many times about this for God to show me a sign and every time, right after I pray about it, something with her pops up. I don’t know if it’s a sign that I should not ignore or if it’s just my crush getting the better of me. I’m ashamed so Please don’t judge me I have never pursued someone so much younger than me. I’m so confused because all I’m really looking for is to be in love, get married and have children. I don’t want to miss the opportunity for that so that’s why I made this post. ❤️",0,1750021947.0,Christian,13,0.33,False

1lcb70y,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1lcb70y/of_flames_and_football/,Of Flames And Football,"Louie called me.
“Jeff’s dead,” he said.

It was Sunday morning. Eight o’clock.

“What do you mean he’s dead?”

“I’m looking at his bedroom window—flames are coming out of it!”

I hung up the phone and threw some clothes on as fast as I could.

I ran the two avenue blocks to Jeff’s apartment building.
There were cops and firefighters everywhere.

“Is anyone dead?” I asked a cop who was meandering out front.

“No. No one’s hurt,” he answered.

I looked around. No Jeff.
WTF, I thought.
He’s not in the apartment—thank God—and not out front either.

Louie showed up.
“He wasn’t in the apartment,” I said.

“Then where the hell is he?”

Johnny Polzato was Jeff’s best friend. Maybe he was at Johnny’s house.

We walked around the block and rang the front doorbell. Johnny’s mom answered.

“Good morning, Mrs. Polzato. Is Jeff here with Johnny?” I asked.

“No, they went to the Giants game to see them play the Chargers.”

Louie and I looked at each other, stunned.
The guy’s apartment—with everything he owns—burns to the ground, and he goes to a football game?

One thing about Jeff he was for the most part harmless and good natured. 

But you were never sure if he was reaching to lend you a hand or to pick your pocket.

This was 1984. No cell phones.
We’d have to wait until they got home around seven o’clock to hear his story.
And I was sure it was going to be a whopper.

Louie said, “Let’s go to Roosevelt Diner on Eighteenth Avenue, get a coffee and a roll with butter, and figure this out.”

We took a corner booth, out of the way.

Jeff was dealing coke for Danny, Paulie, and Gene.
At least thirty grand in product and cash had to have gone up in flames.

We finished breakfast and figured it was time to tell Danny.
He lived in his mom’s basement.

We knocked on the door.

“There was a fire in Jeff’s apartment,” I said.

“Yeah, I saw flames coming out of his window. Thought he was dead,” Louie added.

“Is he all right?”

“Supposedly.”

“What do you mean, supposedly? Where the hell is he?”

“He went to the Giants game with Johnny Polzato.”

“HE WENT TO THE GIANTS GAME? What about my blow and cash?”

“Gonna have to wait until he gets home to find out.”

At eleven, we made our bets with Angelo Rug, the local bookie.
We put a $24 parlay on the Giants to beat the Chargers by seven points and took the over—forty.

Danny’s family was connected, but Danny wasn’t. Not even an associate.
He made a living off coke and pot. To us, he was the boss.

We all had jobs.
I worked in the phone company’s Xeroxing department. I was twenty-five, and it was an entry-level gig—but I saw it as getting my foot in the door.
Louie worked for the parks department. Jeff worked at MTV.

But when we were around Danny, it felt like we were part of the cast of Mean Streets.

“This Jeff’s gonna be working half-price to pay me back. Who the hell burns down their own apartment? I gotta hear this one—even if it’s all lies,” Danny said.

“He’s gonna need a place to live. Probably move in with his sister,” I said.

We watched the Giants beat the Chargers at Angelo’s club.
It was a storefront operation with a bar and a TV. Bensonhurst still didn’t have cable.
We won the bet. We were all eighty bucks richer.

I walked home and made a meatball hero from my mother’s sauce.

Around seven o’clock, the phone rang. It was Jeff, calling from his sister’s house.

“Gerry, I lost everything. All my worldly possessions are gone.”

“Can I ask you something? How do you go to a football game after your place burns down?”

“I had tickets.”

“Did you talk to Danny?”

“Yeah. Luckily, I kept twenty grand at my sister’s house. So I owe him ten grand. He said I can pay him back out of my end.”

“You’re a piece of work, Jeff. Thankfully you’re not hurt.
How’d it happen?”

“I was ironing pants and smoking a joint. I guess I got confused and walked out with the iron still on the board.”

“You are unbelievable. Look, I gotta go. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Never a dull moment, I thought.
Was Jeff actually planning to rip Danny off and lost his nerve, or was he just a burnt out pot head?  Who knows.

At the end of the day, it all worked out—as most things in the neighborhood tended to do.

**Shifting Sands: The Rise of the Nomadic Workforce**

A seismic shift. The workforce unmoored. Laptops, not landlines. Coffee shops, not cubicles. Digital nomads are everywhere—surfing Wi-Fi, not waves. This isn’t a trend. It’s a tectonic plate moving beneath the global economy.

**Why Local Economies Should Care**

Ignore them at your peril. Digital nomads are not tourists—they’re economic catalysts. They inject cash, ideas, and energy into places that crave vitality. Local economies that embrace them? They thrive. Those that resist? They stagnate.

***🚀 Diagnose your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds! [Try the free tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

## Spending Power Unleashed

**The Coffee Shop Economy: Daily Microtransactions**

Espresso shots. Avocado toast. Every swipe of a card is a pulse in the local economy. Nomads fuel the microtransaction ecosystem—cafés, juice bars, and street vendors flourish in their wake.

**Accommodation: From Hostels to High-End Lofts**

Forget the backpacker stereotype. Digital nomads rent chic lofts, boutique hotels, and everything in between. Their appetite for comfort and connectivity keeps landlords and hoteliers smiling. The ripple? More jobs, more renovations, more money in local pockets.

***🌍 Uncover your hidden digital nomad income in 90 seconds! [Check your potential now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

## The Ripple Effect on Local Businesses

**Coworking Spaces: Breeding Grounds for Innovation**

Coworking isn’t just desk rental. It’s a petri dish for ideas. Local entrepreneurs rub shoulders with global thinkers. Startups germinate. The city’s entrepreneurial DNA mutates—fast.

**The Uberization of Local Services**

Nomads demand frictionless living. That means ride-shares, food delivery, laundry apps. Local service providers level up or get left behind. The result? A more dynamic, tech-savvy local economy.

## Skills Transfer and Knowledge Exchange

**Informal Mentorship: Barstool Business Lessons**

The magic happens after hours. Over beers and sunset views, nomads drop knowledge bombs. Locals pick up new skills—marketing hacks, coding tricks, global business etiquette.

**Workshops, Meetups, and the Local Talent Uplift**

Workshops erupt in coworking spaces. Meetups ignite in rooftop bars. The cross-pollination of skills is relentless. Local talent levels up, fast-tracked by global expertise.

***💡 Discover your digital nomad income ceiling in 90 seconds! [Start here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

## Entrepreneurial Ecosystems: Fertilized by Nomads

**Startups Born Abroad**

Some ideas only spark on foreign soil. Nomads launch businesses where inspiration strikes. Local economies become incubators for the next unicorn.

**Investment and Angel Capital Infusion**

Money follows talent. Nomads bring not just ideas but investors. Angel capital flows into local ventures, fueling growth that sticks long after the nomads move on.

## Tourism Reimagined

**Off-Season Lifelines for Tourist Destinations**

Tourist towns dread the off-season. Enter digital nomads—filling rooms, ordering food, keeping businesses afloat when the sun-seekers vanish.

**Hidden Gems: The Nomad’s Guide to the Undiscovered**

Nomads are explorers. They seek the un-Googleable. Their Instagram posts turn sleepy villages into must-visit destinations. The local economy gets a jolt—overnight.

## Cultural Cross-Pollination

**The Language of Money: Bilingual Transactions**

Euros, dollars, crypto. Nomads force local businesses to adapt—multiple languages, multiple currencies. The city’s commercial vocabulary expands.

**Cuisine, Art, and the Hybridization of Local Culture**

Fusion is the new normal. Nomads crave novelty. Local chefs experiment. Artists collaborate. The city’s culture evolves—hybrid, unexpected, alive.

***🌍 Uncover your hidden digital nomad income in 90 seconds! [Check your potential now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

## Real Estate and Urban Development

**Gentrification: Boon or Bane?**

Rents rise. Streets gentrify. Some locals win, others lose. The nomad influx is a double-edged sword—revitalizing neighborhoods, but sometimes displacing the vulnerable.

**Short-Term Rentals and Housing Dynamics**

Airbnb booms. Landlords pivot to short-term gains. The housing equation warps—supply, demand, and affordability all thrown into the blender.

***✈️ Ready to see your digital nomad earning power? [Take the free quiz!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

## Digital Infrastructure Upgrades

**Wi-Fi Wars: The Push for Better Connectivity**

Nomads don’t tolerate bad Wi-Fi. Cities scramble to upgrade. Fiber optics snake through old neighborhoods. Everyone wins—locals and visitors alike.

**Tech Adoption in Traditional Sectors**

Digital payments. Online booking. Even the corner bakery gets a website. Nomads drag traditional businesses into the digital age—sometimes kicking and screaming.

## Taxation and Legal Gray Zones

**Who Pays? The Nomad Tax Dilemma**

Nomads earn globally, spend locally. Who collects the tax? Governments scramble for answers. The legal gray zone breeds innovation—and headaches.

**Local Policy Adaptations**

Smart cities adapt. Special visas. Tax incentives. Legal frameworks that welcome nomads while protecting locals. The future belongs to the flexible.

## Social Impact and Community Building

**Volunteerism and Grassroots Initiatives**

Nomads aren’t just takers. Many give back—teaching, volunteering, launching grassroots projects. The social fabric strengthens.

1lcb15h,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1lcb15h/spike_question/,Spike question,"I was diagnosed earlier this year and I haven't taken any diabetic classes yet. My a1C was 7.8 but a little over a month earlier I had been on steroid treatment including bed bound hospitalization and insulin in hospital, then at home without insulin, totaling about 3-4 weeks it starts with P but I can't recall, very common. My nurse did ask me if I was sure I'm not diabetic and according to what I knew at the time, I was not. 

My doctor repeated the a1C immediately (my understanding was a repeat test would have been after a couple of weeks maybe) and it was not a lab error, but I am curious how likely it is that my number was falsely inflated because of that? Previously I have been checked annually with number below 5.5 every year. Between last year's test and this was about a year as well, but I did gain weight slowly the past couple of years. Would that possibly trigger something? My 

I'm autistic and I'm not questioning my doctor and I take my meds and watch what I eat. I'm just curious and pondering because I like to know and understand how things work. The last couple days have been hard to manage eating out on a trip though. For example yesterday I did have two beignets, a nice salad with a light vinaigrette, and then I ordered chicken tenders later on and my level was 130 this morning. Then we had coffee, crepes with fresh fruit and ham and then I had half a donut and two hours later I'm at 160. Is that normal? Is that because of my meds? It's so variable and I hate when things are unclear. ",2,1750021509.0,diabetes_t2,1,1.0,False
1lcb0cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphisgrizzlies/comments/1lcb0cu/于公狂喜于私不舍_my_first_reaction_to_des_trade/,于公狂喜，于私不舍 My First Reaction to Des' Trade,"When Desmond Bane was traded, I was sitting in a coffee shop writing. My reaction was just like yours—and by coincidence, I happened to be wearing a Bane T-shirt that day. It felt like fate. Here are my first thoughts:

**Zach Kleiman continues to show his skill in making smart moves**. Looking at this trade from a neutral point of view, the Grizzlies clearly came out ahead. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a poor shooting season, but he has a solid track record, is extremely durable, and is not too old. Cole Anthony is very athletic, can play both with and without the ball, and brings high energy—he’s more than good enough to be a scoring option off the bench. And getting four unprotected first-round picks is incredible, especially considering the 2026 pick from the Phoenix Suns could be quite valuable. If the Orlando Magic don’t achieve much over the next three years, the 2028 and 2030 picks could become key assets for the Grizzlies’ next chapter—whether they extend Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. and keep competing or decide to rebuild. Either way, this trade helps both the present and the future, and breaking one big contract into two smaller ones also gives the team more flexibility.

Earlier this season, Bane’s numbers dropped because the team didn’t run a pick-and-roll system and his usage went down. Then in the playoffs, he faced the one team best equipped to shut down his style. His physical limitations were exposed by Jalen Williams. Ask any non-Grizzlies fan—they might think Bane was at the lowest point of his career value. But actually, since early 2025, Bane’s regular-season efficiency bounced back. His finishing numbers this season were even the best of his career. **I don’t think he’s declining**. His $40 million-per-year salary depends on perspective. As a third option on a playoff team, he’s a luxury. But as a third option on a title contender, he might not be enough. We’ve already seen his ceiling.

At the season-ending press conference, I noticed something strange—Zach Kleiman talked for 25 minutes but barely mentioned Bane. He only focused on Jaren Jackson Jr. and Ja Morant. At the time, it felt weird. He kept talking about wanting to trade for “dog-type” players. Now with Caldwell-Pope and Anthony, he’s clearly following through.

I’m excited to hear Kleiman speak next. With more than 10 first-round picks and 100 second-rounders, I don’t think he’s done making moves. If they’re interested in Deni Avdija, does that mean Santi Aldama is no longer part of the plan? It’s only June—maybe more surprises are coming.

Desmond Bane has been one of my favorite players. I’ve often said on my podcast that I hoped he would stay in Memphis for his whole career and have his jersey retired. Sadly, that won’t happen now. He helped win the only playoff series the Grizzlies have taken in the past ten years. He fought through games with a team full of injuries and always competed hard. He earned every penny of his contract. When he returns to play in Memphis next season, I’ll be in the crowd wearing your T-shirt. **Best of luck, Memphis’ best shooter ever.**

1lcb07w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lcb07w/did_anyone_experience_a_decrease_of_stimulant/,Did anyone experience a decrease of stimulant tolerance as they got older?,"Has anyone experienced their caffeine/stimulant tolerance decrease with age?

In my early 20s, my Adderall IR dose was 20mg three times a day and would still have to supplement with caffeine throughout the day, otherwise I would be dosing off in school/class. Usually it was about 16oz of coffee in my insulated thermos which I would carry around. 

Now, I am almost 30 and unfortunately adderall IR just isn’t working for me anymore like it used to. I find it (kinda) works for a couple hours for focus but after that, I am left with being a wide-awake zombie struggling with getting anything done but completely restless to where it is affecting my sleep even if I took my 2nd dose around 2pm. because of this my Dr switched me to zenzedi which is similar to Adderall IR, without the levo-amphetamine which gives similar effects as caffeine..

I have been unmedicated for a few weeks already and I am struggling so bad. I tried to drink a small can of redbull around 11am and found that it kept me up ALL night for some reason which is wild to me considering I didn’t have issues drinking a redbull around 5pm before.. this small can of redbull had less caffeine than a cup of coffee.. around 77mg of caffeine..

1lcazc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1lcazc3/this_call_is_monitored_for_quality_assurance/,This Call Is Monitored for Quality Assurance,"

I stepped through the sliding doors into the freezing office of HumanTech, Inc.—a gray brick building with no windows and buzzing fluorescent lighting. 

Management kept the air conditioning blasting to keep the servers from overheating. They reprimanded me last week for bringing a hoodie from home, as all clothing needed to have the HumanTech logo. I would have to purchase the jacket with company credits. I’d need to work overtime to make up for the lost income. Otherwise, I would lose my right to housing and have to go back to the Department of Labor Resources. 

If no jobs were available they’d throw me in prison for the worst kind of labor. People who went to prison never came out the same, if they ever came out at all. Most disappeared forever once they sank that low. I couldn’t fail at this. I had no choice but to move forward.

I paid another five credits for over-brewed coffee that looked like tar. Its heat melted the sides of the foam cup, bubbles breaking on the surface. I put a lid on the beverage and carefully walked over to my desk. 

I scanned my retina into the system, and the computer whirred as it sluggishly booted up. The screen loaded, starting a dozen applications, all of which took their sweet time to load.

“*Come the fuck on,*” I muttered under my breath, making sure my headset was off. A quiet rebellion, one of the last still allowed. The last thing I needed was HumanTech to dock my pay for profanity. The apps came to life, designed to keep track of my every move and breath. Cameras swiveled everywhere, from this office to my spartan, company-approved living quarters. I grumbled under my breath. But it could be worse. I could do hard labor in a wellness camp instead.

Management made our desks stand only to fight obesity rates. A stationary stair climber waited under my desk like a threat. They required us to hit a minimum of 5,000 steps a day, or they would increase our health insurance premiums and deduct the amount from our credits. And they expected us to make these steps between calls.

My headset rang before my computer fully booted itself up. Static crackled on the line.

“Human Tech services, this is Karen speaking. How may I help you?” 

“Karen. You said your name is Karen?” an elderly voice chirped through static on the other side of the phone.

I rolled my eyes; I knew all the jokes surrounding my name, and I was not in the mood. My computer dinged. “Make sure you smile. We do not permit eye-rolling. Our members are important to us.” I forced a smile. “Make sure the smile reaches your eyes. We can always tell. Service with a smile, our customers can hear it.” I slammed on my mouse, minimizing the app.

“Yes, my name is Karen. This call is monitored for quality assurance. How can I help?”

“Thank you, Karen. I’m sorry I’m hard of hearing, but I need your help, please!” 

My stomach dropped as I heard desperation in the older woman’s voice.

“Certainly, I’ll see what I can do. But I need your name and file number.”

“I don’t know my file number, but I can give you my name. It’s Edith Meyer.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Meyer. I.. I’m going to need something more specific, a date of birth.”

“June 14, 1984. Please!”

I searched the system and breathed a sigh of relief to find only one Edith Meyer with that specific birthdate. Her file sat in front of me. It detailed her entire life. Every click, every search, every swipe of data stood before me.

“I have your file. How can I assist you?” I asked.

“My smart vehicle is out of control. I asked it to drive me to the grocery store, and it was going on its route, but then, before it turned on the correct street, all the doors locked, and it sped to an undisclosed location. Ma’am, I’m moving so fast, I’m scared. Help me.”

“What is the make and model of your vehicle?” I asked.

“What does this matter? 2055HumantechSUV Alto.”

My heart pounded against my ribs as I pulled up my troubleshooting manual. The page slowly loaded while my AI chirped at me for the long silence.

“Thank you for holding, Mrs. Meyer. Let’s walk through some troubleshooting steps,” I said, trying to hide the shaking in my voice.

“My car almost ran into someone on the highway!” A horn honked in the background.

“Did you try to switch it to manual-”

I gritted my teeth. The troubleshooting steps were asinine, and every minute in counted. It had already been five minutes, and that was too long.

“Karen, that’s the first thing I did. Can you remote in and stop this thing?”

“I wish I could, but we don’t have that ability.”

I submitted a suggestion for an override switch to the back office months ago, but they denied it as it would cause too much disruption to system efficiency. I wanted to scream.

Edith sobbed on the other end of the line.

“Have you tried turning the power off or hitting the emergency brake?”

“Yes, I’ve tried both and nothing.”

I frantically searched through the operator manual but found nothing to stop the runaway smart SUV. The call passed ten minutes. I’d get docked for hold time-but I couldn’t let her die.

“Ma’am, I’m going to need to put you on a brief hold,” I said.

“Please don’t leave me!”

“I can keep you on the line, but I need to reach out to the help desk. It might take a few minutes.”

Edith sobbed through the muzak. Fifteen minutes passed like a lifetime. I winced as I glared at the holdtime. 

“Hello, this is Brandon, with the help desk. How can I assist?” said a cold voice.

“Hi, it’s Karen. I have Mrs. Edith Myer on the line with me, and her 2055HumanTechSUV Alto is stuck in smart mode. It’s an emergency, and we need to remote in and stop the vehicle.”

“Oh. This is a common problem,” said Brandon, matter-of-factly. “Let me pull up her file.”

After a few more minutes of sobbing and hold music, Bandon picked up the line again. “So, Mrs. Meyer, HumanTech Industries has yet to receive paperwork that lists a caretaker since you’ve left employment.”

“What does that have to do with my car being out of control? I need you to help.”

“Mrs. Meyer, all Smart Vehicles take you to an Elder facility if the caretaker clause is not filed within one year. You are on your way to Lakeview retreat. You will receive the best of care there.”

A cold knot formed in my stomach. Lakeview was where HumanTech sent elderly people who could no longer work and had no one to care for them. No one ever saw them again.

“Lakeview?” asked Edith through tears. “I was a nurse at Lakeview before everything changed. When we all had freedom, that’s why they want to get rid of me. Because I still remember freedom.”

“Do you have any family and friends that can verbally stand in for your care?” asked Brandon.

“We can’t send her to Lakeview!” I yelled. My AI burning red, I would receive coaching on my tone, but it didn’t matter. I took a deep breath. “Edith, do you have any family members at all, any friends? Is there any way you can apply for work? Just something.”

“Karen, I need you to take a deep breath. Edith will receive wonderful care at Lakeview,” said Brandon, his voice unctuous with corporate speech.

“I don’t have anybody,” cried Edith. “I can’t work, and I’m nearly blind.”

“I’m so sorry. You will arrive at Lakeview within ninety minutes. There is no override.”

“You’re sending me there to DIE!” screamed Edith.

“This call is over. You’re no longer productive and we all die eventually.”

The line went dead, and a cold stone formed in my stomach. My chat box lit up with the name Brandon Foster.

: PLEASE AVOID TRANSFERRING CALLS TO MY DEPARTMENT. THE EMOTIONAL OUTBURST WAS UNCALLED FOR AS WELL:

What would you say if that were your mother? I was trying to care for her.:

: Edith has already served her function. Lakeview will harvest her organs for reuse and provide her with a free cremation service.:

: You’re a sociopath.:

I’m also your supervisor. I need you to take five minutes to meditate and do what you need to do to serve your purpose. Otherwise, we can look into the reassignment of duties. :

I wanted flip my desk, scream, break something- but I swallowed it down. My phone beeped, and I thought of warmth as tears welled up but I smiled.

Everyone knows about these, they've been discussed ad nauseum. How about we put a little selection of them into a blind and see how things progress...?

These barrels vary wildly in retail and secondary pricing, but I was curious enough about their provenance that I wanted to try a random smattering across proofs, ages, brands, and price points, and to see how close or far BT was from the mark given WT wholesale dumping them onto brokers. Will I find a could-be GTS? Will I find some old Austin Nichols profiles? Who knows! I have had only a smattering of these barrels prior to this blind, including Mythical 16 year, Elkwood Turkey Rex, and Buckner's Philly, but I loved them and wanted to see how different these barrels have gotten from each other.

# The Blind

[Round 1](https://preview.redd.it/w0ajc4vzl57f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60d3415c5141707d0bf737e8591398944f5c0083)

**VT Sample 1**

Nose: Initial thoughts are maple and cherry buttercream, this amazing mellow rye character presenting like sweet florals and buttery sweet oxidized pine sap, cracked black pepper, pu erh tea, mature oak (butterscotch, wood varnishes, milk chocolate), such a special and atypical nose. Really pleasant, mellow, and converging with several other legacy distillery profiles. It has the dusty, oxidized butterscotch that one might find in a bottle of yore, or perhaps in old MGP bourbon bottlings, or even those well-nursed gold neck four roses. It has this funky cherry-meets-basement thing that smells like something you'd pick up on a bottle from Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, which is obviously an inherited characteristic from the dynamics of BT distillation, and an intrinsically fascinating characteristic of these barrels; this one has this WLW maraschino cherry syrup aspect, rich oak from GTS, and funk from these complex florals. Rounding things an always present florality that I associate with WT, like ""orange"" and ""purple"", if those were types of flowers. These are just such cool barrels. This is the first round and it's just high-quality off the bat.

Palate: Really nice butterscotch and cherry right off the rip, complex oak presenting as buckwheat honey, this delicate balance of of sweetness and savory complexity, oily initially but then starts to become evident that it's something you want to sip and savor, a long finish with medium tannin. As it opens up it becomes really acceptable, and presents with this salted caramel and toasted coconut finish. Tremendous, old school, mature bourbon.

WT:BT

65:35

Score 89

**Prunier Sample 2**

Nose: Much more rambunctious on the nose than sample 1. Brighter (not so oxidized) and more assertively sugared, not as balanced. Really interesting fruit profile that has this raspberry compote vibe with undertones of peach. Verging on tropical fruit? Not much in the way of spices, just various forms of caramelized sugars and rich oak, funky buttery, nutty, bready component rounding it out. Has this dusty quality to it, just like sample 1. Reminds me of some great MGP with this brown sugar cookie, cherry syrup quality. These barrels are just so cool, they're invoking disparate sense-memory spaces in my mind. These are like chameleon barrels.

Palate: Clearly a big boy. Big tannins, drying, focused. Hot cherry, leather, bitter coffee. Not much sweetness on the palate, sort of dies, short bitter finish. Burns for a while.

WT:BT

50:50

Score: 88

# Round 2

[RABBIT!](https://preview.redd.it/c98digl5m57f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ff0a05ab7ade3a279957fb47075cc5ccb5af8be)

**VT Sample 3**

Nose: Sort of generic smelling mature bourbon. Predominantly musty oak, with some light notes of fruited tea and cherry. This musty/dusty oxidized characteristic seems to be a thread starting to emerge from the fabric. Has some strong buffalo trace character, sweet toasted oak, butterscotch, and as it opens up, develops an almost soapy cherry blossom florality.

Palate:  sweet and not dissimilar from the nose. It has a persistent warmth, definitely a sipper. Brown sugar, indistinct red fruit, hay, toasted oak.

Score: 87

55:45 BT:WT

**Prunier Sample 4**

Nose: very sweet black cherry, background of oils and varnishes, vanilla florals. Some interesting acidic, yellow/green grape notes. Really outstanding clarity and desserts driven. Bordering on characteristics in Armagnac! Underlying oak is subdued and toasted. Presents very little rye character at all, more like high corn.

Palate: assertive, but not violent. Very bright, effervescent cherry cola. Background is caramel and black tea, not much tannin, bright effervescent finish of cherry, lime, lemon, craft root beer. Very cool. Not very floral.

Score: 88/89

60:40

# Round 3

*Forgot to take a picture, who cares it's a blind anyways.*

**VT Sample 5**

Nose: Smells like Weller 15/16 year, as opposed to Weller 12, if there was such a thing. Pretty big mouthfeel, a little too assertive. The usual suspects, cherry, vanilla, but with some extra complexity from the additional oak. The musty/dusty quality persists, even giving way to some interesting savory florals and baking spices. As it opens up I start to get more of a baked apple, clove, tobacco quality, melding with the cherry. Almost smokey? Some butterscotch, even.

Palate: Fairly consistent with the aromas. More on leather, tobacco, milk chocolate, maple blossom honey, butterscotch toasted oak. Finishes with the cherry and baking spice combo, fairly powerful, medium length, sour cherry retronasal.

Score: 86

60:40

**Prunier Sample 6**

Nose: Rich caramel, cherry and peach syrups, peanuts, sweet pipe tobacco. Oregano, fennel. Light sweaty pine sap.

Palate: Very agreeable, and consistent with the aromas. Nutty and caramelized. Tobacco, stone fruits, somewhat acidic. Not particularly tannic, interesting acidic qualities in the finish. Fairly long, transitioning between nutty, savory, to bright acidic fruit and baking spices. Sweeter than Sample 5 on the nose and palate. Oily initially, but drying qualities emerge the deeper I get into the pour.

Score: 88

50:50

# Round 4

*missing pic, see above.*

**Prunier Sample 7**

Nose: Somewhat muted. Musty grape and stewed apples, butterscotch, oak driven. Tobacco.

Palate: Nutty and leathery, tobacco, toasted oak, bitter chocolate, caramelized sugars. Almost no fruitiness, more oak driven than anything. Finish is medium length, semi-drying.

Score: 86

50:50

**VT Sample 8**

Nose: Quite sweet, brown sugar and toffee, caramelized. Grape cola, sour cherry syrup. Milk chocolate oak. Initially bright but mellows into a more balanced pour, seems high proof. Excellent and straightforward.

Palate: More balanced between sweet and savory, strong attack, medium tannin. Baking spices and brown sugar vie for attention, with an acidic fruity brightness as it transitions into the finish. Milk chocolate. Grape skins. Assertive. Long.

Score: 89/90

65:35

**Onion Sample 9**

Nose: Cherry, vanilla, grape. Robust. Light butterscotch. Rich oak. Delicious and concentrated.

Palate: Strong. Tobacco, butterscotch, baking spices, apple pie, milk chocolate, some nutty toasty tannins. Acidic stone fruit. Grape. Assertive finish. Milk chocolate, nutty and spicy tannins, long.

Score: 89

50:50

# Post-blind thoughts:

These are all really great, and there aren't huge differences in quality (initial point spread 86-89/90), but some have just a little more exuberance, or a little more clarity, or a little bit more uniqueness. I can see why they were dumped onto the brokerage market, these were generally much more about BT profiles than WT. The other barrels I've tasted were also more BT leaning.

So, since I still have a bunch of liquid left in the sample bottles, I took my results and chose my four favorites for a second blind, mimicking the process of a selection...

# 4-Way Selection

[4-Way](https://preview.redd.it/yuwf3ummm57f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa4e8dce119ecc74cec45b2eb55d7ad99e0028a)

**Onion Sample 1**

Nose: Varnishes and bright florals, spicy piney oils, bright orchard fruits, old gewurtzraminer, concentrated. Very pleasant fruity top notes. Strong smelling.

Palate: Driven by rich oak and spices, stewed apples and plums, sweet but strong. Tastes like an amped up Eagle Rare.

Score: 87

**Prunier Sample 2**

Nose: Fennel, Oregano, Pine, Musty butterscotch. Very old yellow port, fresh cut mushroom, stewed yellow plums and yellow cherries. Smells like dusty Turkey.

Palate: Initially driven by buttery sugared oak, leathery tannin, and transitioning into acidic yellow cherries, oregano. Such a cool barrel. Tastes old school. Elegant but assertive, hitting all the feels, definitely more in the WT camp than a typical barrel from this run.

Score: 91

**VT Sample 3**

Nose: Delicate, heady oak varnishes, tobacco, sour cherries. Gives way to butterscotch and old books, lemonade, strong Polish orange blossom mead.

Palate: Interesting balance of butterscotch and bitter musty almond tannins, acidic berries and grapes, very long, evolving finish.

Score: 87

**Onion Sample 4**

Nose: New Y'quem, an field of wildflowers, kiawe blossom/passionfruit Traditional Mead, fine alcohol aromas like varnishes and solvents, salted caramels. Sharing some commonalities with violently delicious rums where sugars lean into the maillard with burnt brown sugar and sweet pipe tobacco. Constantly present tropical florals like kiawe and acidic stonefruits and sour berries. Some very elegant dusty butterscotch. Constantly shifting. A bag of fruits like you would find in a teenage Longmorn.

Palate: Bright effervescent florals, sour cherries, brown sugar cookies, acidic stonefruit. This is very bright, sweet, and convergent with other genres. Lots of threads between the nose and palate.

Score: 89

Well this was really interesting, its always fun to go back and see how notes compare in successive blinds. Each day brings a new palate, so I'm glad I wasn't too far away from the mark.

So, the results of the ""selection"". I was torn between Sample 2 and 4, very different but nearly equally interesting in character. If you are more into more high-octane, complex stuff, you would likely prefer Sample 4 for its exuberant fruits, sugars, and solvents. Ultimately, I would select the barrel of Sample 2 for  the apparent rarity of this profile among this run of barrels. It's just plain old-school, dusty Turkey. It exemplifies the oxidized, musty, floral, cherry and butterscotch driven profile that I love about old bottlings that never is really quite captured from modern production, except if Buffalo Trace makes it, apparently.

### **Executive Summary**

**Mission**: To evolve Sears Corporation from a dominant omnichannel retailer into a fully mature, retail-tech-service ecosystem. This phase will focus on scaling Sears.com to undisputed e-commerce supremacy, leveraging the 2007 launch of the smartphone to pioneer mobile commerce, and deploying advanced robotics and AI to create an unparalleled operational advantage. The Global Financial Crisis will be weaponized to acquire strategic assets and launch an opportunistic Corporate Wealth Fund, solidifying Sears Corp.'s market supremacy and setting the stage for global expansion in Phase 3.

**Projected Outcome (2010)**: A $78.7B global-ready corporation with a valuation of nearly $87B. Sears.com will have surpassed Amazon in revenue and market share, while the deep integration of manufacturing, services, real estate, and finance creates an unassailable competitive moat.

* **Market Dynamics (2005-2010)**: The launch of the **iPhone (2007)** will create a new mobile frontier. The **Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009)** will cripple our over-leveraged competitors, presenting a once-in-a-generation opportunity for expansion and acquisition.

***

### **II. Phase 2 Corporate & Financial Strategy**

#### **A. Financial Strategy & Funding**

> A total of **$5.9B** will be available for Phase 2. This war chest allows us to play aggressive offense while others retreat.

* **Sources**: **$1.7B** starting surplus, **$2.5B** in retained earnings, a **$1B** ""flight to quality"" equity raise (Q3 2008), and a **$200M** draw on a pre-secured credit line.

#### **B. The GFC Maneuver: CWF & Acquisitions**

### **III. Pillars of the Synergetic Behemoth: Phase 2 Divisional Plans**

#### **1. Sears.com & The Cultural Catalog**
* **Objective**: Grow to **$42B revenue and 60M users**, winning the new mobile commerce frontier.
* **Strategy**:
    * **Mobile First**: The 2007 iPhone launch is our trigger. We will launch the definitive **Sears App** by Q2 2008, a year ahead of most retailers, integrating shopping, Sears Pay, and HomeForce scheduling.
    * **PartsDirect Expansion**: This key service-oriented sub-brand will grow to a **$9B business**, becoming the default destination for every garage and DIYer in North America.
    * **The Catalog's Cultural Impact**: The transformed catalog becomes a powerful branding tool. The **Christmas ""Wish Book""** is a treasured, high-quality annual publication that drives holiday demand. The quarterly **""Sears Lookbook""** becomes a coffee-table staple in Prime member homes, showcasing new styles and reinforcing our image as a curator of quality American life. Distribution is an exclusive, opt-in perk for our 15M Prime subscribers, making it both desired and cost-effective.

#### **2. Core Brands & Domestic Manufacturing**
* **Objective**: To deepen our competitive moat through superior quality, IoT innovation, and a strengthened ""Made in USA"" narrative.
* **Strategy**:
    * **IoT Integration**: We will pioneer the ""smart home"" by embedding IoT technology into our products. **Kenmore ""Smart"" Appliances (2008)** will self-diagnose and connect directly to HomeForce. **Craftsman ""Connected"" Tools (2009)** will track performance via the Sears App.
    * **Western Forge Acquisition (2009)**: We will acquire our primary hand tool supplier for **~$70M**, bringing nearly all Craftsman hand tool manufacturing under direct corporate ownership and control.
    * **Brand Growth & Market Share Targets (2010)**:

| Brand | 2010 Revenue Goal | 2010 Market Share Goal | Key Phase 2 Initiative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kenmore** | $6.0B | 35% | Launch of ""Smart"" IoT appliance line. |
| **Craftsman**| $5.0B | 25% | Acquisition of Western Forge; launch of ""Connected"" tools. |
| **DieHard** | $3.5B | 25% | Advanced lithium-ion development for tools and EVs. |
| **Silvertone**| $3.0B | 10% | Integration with Sears.com for media streaming services. |
| **RoadHandler**| $1.5B | 15% | Development of eco-friendly, low-rolling-resistance tires. |
| **WeatherBeater**| $1.5B | 10% | Introduction of a full line of zero-VOC paints. |
| **Harmony House**| $1.0B | 8% | Partnership with sustainable textile manufacturers. |
| **Coldspot** | $1.0B | 8% | Focus on high-efficiency Energy Star heat pumps and AC units. |
| **Char-Broil**| $0.5B | 10% | Introduction of smart grills with temperature control apps. |

#### **3. Sears Academy: The Engine of Culture**
* **Objective**: To be the premier corporate training institution in North America, ensuring our workforce is the best-equipped in the industry.
* **Strategy**: The Dallas campus will be expanded. The curriculum will be radically updated to focus on the future: **IoT diagnostics training** for HomeForce and Auto Center techs, **mobile app development** and **AI principles** for our tech division, and advanced **supply chain management** for logistics staff. The Academy will be a key selling point in recruitment, offering a clear path for career advancement and continuous learning.

#### **4. HomeForce: The Ecosystem's Service Layer**
* **Objective**: To be the trusted, go-to service provider for every item sold on Sears.com.
* **Integration**: HomeForce's value explodes in this phase. Technicians, trained at the Sears Academy, become our ambassadors. When a ""Smart"" Kenmore washer detects an imbalance, it doesn't just show an error code; it pings the customer's Sears App with a suggestion to book a HomeForce check-up with one tap, with the necessary part already flagged by **PartsDirect** for the technician. This closed-loop system is a service experience no competitor can replicate.

#### **5. Logistics & Robotics: The Automated Backbone**
* **Objective**: To achieve full operational advantage through automation.
* **Strategy**: By 2010, **all 10 regional hubs will be fully automated with our proprietary AGVs**, developed by the Sears Robotics division. This cuts sorting and transit times by 30%. The Robotics division will also begin live pilot programs for **ground-based delivery robots** within three of our Homart Communities, delivering packages from the on-site micro-DC directly to townhouses.

#### **6. All Other Pillars**
* **Sears Financial & CWF**: Will scale its digital banking services, launch the Sears Pay mobile app, and execute the highly successful **$1B CWF launch in 2009**.
* **Homart Communities**: Will thrive as retail havens during the GFC, with their management teams finalizing the target list for the massive mall acquisition spree to begin in Phase 3.
* **Services & Canada**: The Auto Centers, Optical division, and Canadian operations will all scale as planned, with technology (IoT diagnostics, telehealth) integrated throughout.

***

### **IV. The Outcome: Sears Corp. in 2010**

> The synergistic machine is now fully operational, delivering results that exceed the initial plan.

#### **A. Financial Snapshot (2010)**

| Metric | 2010 Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | **$78.7B** |
| **EBITDA** | **$6.3B** (~8% margin) |
| **Valuation** | **~$86.7B** (13.75x EBITDA) |
| **Debt** | **$200M** (strategic credit draw) |
| **Cash Surplus** | **$1.4B** |
| **CWF Assets** | **~$1B** (at a deeply depressed cost basis, poised for huge growth) |

#### **B. Competitive Positioning**

Sears Corporation's lead has widened. The GFC has weakened rivals, while our tech and service integrations have created deep customer loyalty. Amazon remains a distant second in North American e-commerce, and Home Depot's market share has been permanently eroded.

***

### **V. Phase 1 Timeline: Key Milestones**

* **2005-2006**: Scale Sears.com to $30B revenue. Expand HomeForce to 9,000 technicians. Begin development of IoT platforms for Kenmore and Craftsman.
* **2007-2008**: Launch the Sears App for iPhone within a year of the device's release. Secure $1B credit line and raise $1B in equity. Deploy AI-driven search on Sears.com.
* **2009-2010**: During the GFC, execute the acquisition of Western Forge. Launch the $1B Corporate Wealth Fund. Deploy first hybrid vans in logistics fleet. Achieve all revenue and market share targets, positioning Sears Corp. for global expansion.

1lcamkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1lcamkt/it_is_time_healed_after_four_years/,It is time: Healed after four years,"I have been hesitant to write this post because I wanted to be sure. But I have been pain and symptoms free for four months. So here it is, maybe it can help some one. 

**Short version**  
Turns out, it was not only or even mainly gastritis, at least most of the time. It was: 1. flares of gastritis, not healing because of 2. (gastritis-induced) histamine intolerance; 3,. SIBO (induced by PPIs and masking as gastritis) and 4. poor motility (induced by the gastritis and or PPIs and or SIBO).   
Treatment: Bland diet + off PPIs + treatment for histamine intolerance (DAO + supplements) for the gastritis; rifaximin + prucalopride for SIBO and poor motility.  
Main lesson: If at all possible, try to find a proper diagnistician.

**Long version:**

History and treatment

I had been suffering from gastritis - or what I thought was only gastritis - for years. It was confirmed by 2 endoscopies (year 1 and 3) and treated with PPIs of various kinds and doses for four years. In the beginning and during a later flare, my **symptoms** were horrible nausea, fullness and reflux. However, most of the time after I initially fot sick, there was no nausea, but instead horrible pain with occasional feelings of fullness/reflux. That should have been a clear sign that different things were going on - but no one caught it. Like for so many of us, I had two different internal medicine specialists telling me that ""gastritis is very comon"" and ""it was probably stress"". IT REALLY WAS NOT. 

  
During my last flare I finally managed to find a **new gastroenterologist** who is an excellent diagnoistician. Total green flag: He did not do another gastroscopy because he said: We know there is inflammation, question is why it is not healing. I had been on a semi-bland and then bland diet for 2-3 months by then (and had tried versions of this in the past). He took me off PPIs immediately, because he thought they had become part of the problem by then. He did an ultrasound and ran loads of blood tests. The blood test showed a **histamine deficiency** which was both a result of the gastritis and prevented it from healing. I started taking a DAO supplement (the missing enzyme) and a combination of vitamin B6, zinc, glutathione and vitamin C, which the body needs to make DAO. I was specifically instructed to not go on a low histamine diet.

When my symptoms improved only partly and I still had pain and was feeling full constantly, the doc said he thought it was **SIBO** after all. My symptoms were really atypical for SIBO (no bloating) and a breath test had come back negative. But it felt like SIBO to the doc - and this is exactly why you need an experienced diagnostician. (One hint was that I had to supplement vitamin A and D already - SIBO can cause deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins.) I was given a course of rifaximin (the antibiotic used in most SIBO treatments) and went on a low FODMAP diet for 8 weeks. (From a gastritis diet to low FODMAP, as all of you know, healing takes some real dedication.) I was a lot better after the treatment but still not symptom free, so we did more tests and I was diagnosed with **low motility**. I was prescribed Prucalopride and boom - that got my digestion going and took away the last 30% of my symptoms. Turns out, long-term PPI use can also impact motility. Plus SIBO and motility issues can cause/strengthen each other. My motility issues were never bad enough for me to notice, but food was staying in the stomach too long (increasing the gastritis inflammation), the small intestine was moving to slowly (not getting rid of thre SIBO-bacteria quickly enough) and so was the large intestine (allowing bacteria to migrate to the small intestine). 

How I am now:

I am completely **symptom free** and have been so for months. I eat everything I want, I have coffee and an occasional drink. I am still a bit wary of spicy food and alcohol, but I am dipping my toes. I am off all medications except prucalopride.

There is probably some chronic gastritis inflammation left in my stomach, but we havent confirmed that. But since around 50% of the population have that and it doesnt cause problems for most and it doesnt put you at risk for stomach cancer or other illnesses. If the nausea etc ever returns, I will address it. 

**Psychologically**, I cannot emphasize enough how much my quality of life has improved. No more pain, no more constant worrying, wondering what I did wrong, looking for causes. It is ridiculous, but simply having a proper doctors who takes this illness seriously and is ready to address it (instead of just accept it) made A WORLD of difference. Suddenly, it was someone else's responsibility to figure out the problem and that felt SO GOOD. Not to mention, not have to meal prep every time while on a bland and then low FODMAP diet. 

**Main takeaways**

Last but not least, here are what, for me, are the main takeaways of my experience. Maybe they can help someone else.

1. Find a specialist, if at all possible: I know, many people don't have access to health care the way that it should be. However, even those of us who do are quickly discouraged by the total ignorance of the medical community towards gastritis (and SIBO). So if you can, don't stop until you find a proper gastroenterologist who is a good diagnistician and has experience with treating a variety of gastric disorders. Some indicators are: Ho w thoroughly do they question you? Is their business model basically doing endoscopies? If so - RUN! If you already had one done, that should be enough and other things should be tested. 

2. Look into SIBO. I know, this sub is full of people with a similar story as mine: gastritis plus SIBO. I still never thought it applied to me because my symptoms did not fit. Especially if you have been on PPis, SIBO might very well be part of the mix. I did have it, and it was a miracle it was caught with atypical symptoms and negative test. 

3. Use reddit, but do so carefully: Both this sub and the SIBO sub are wells of information and the low FODMAP sub was a lifesaver. I learned so much that helped me understand the diseases and get a grip on them. The information also helped me determine that my doctor was competent and working up to the current medical standards in the field. And despite me getting good treatment, I still learned loads of stuff from reddit that I would not have known otherwise (especially on the various diets, treatment regiments, etc.)  
But, and this is a big but, there is also sooo much misinformation on here. So take everything, my experience included, with a large grain of salt. Peopke self-treat because of lack of alternatives, they fall for quacks or they might simply have different issues than you. The best that reddit can do is to help you get an overview, understand the illnesses and what the current standard of diagnosis and treatment is for various diseases. For me, the most helpful resources were the following:   
For gastritis: The gastritis healing book,   
For SIBO: the research of Dr. Pimentel and the wonderful knowledge drop by u/DaDa462  
For low FODMAP: The sub and the Monash app

4. If you have been sick for years, you should expect to have more than one illness or health problem. The intestinal tract works together as one, so after a while a problem in one part might cause problems in other parts. Medications like PPIs (while helpful for many and especially in the short term), can cause issues as well. Furthermore, many gastrointestinal problems cause nutrient deficiencies which can lead to more health issues. Another reason why you need an experienced gastroenterologist and diagnostician. 

I also wanted to thank everybody who shares information and answers questions on this sub. It helped me to empower myself to seek proper treatment and feel less alone. You are amazing!

__
Two more additions:
- I am not demonizing PPIs. I believe they can be very effective short term for gastritis or even long term for other gastric problems. But their long term use should only be for good reason and be closely monitored.
- I always found it impossible to identify my triggers and it drove me crazy. I reacted to everything and nothing, sometimes soon after eating and sometimes much later. Looking back, that could have shown that more than one thing was going on. I was reacting to gastritis triggers, high histamine foods and high fodmap foods, while common culprits like sugar were perfectly fine.",16,1750020448.0,Gastritis,27,0.95,False

There are a few small cafes but they don’t fully compare aesthetically and quality wise. I firmly believe my vision could bring a constant flow of people. I was thinking of not only selling coffee but also sandwiches and other non food products, doing events for people and other little upcharges we can think of (i know this isn’t some original business model) With that in mind i went in to chat gpt lol and plugged all of the numbers and costs i could think off and asked it how profitable it could be solely for me as an owner and it said i could bring home around 170k a year which i would call a success.

I’m not sure what other business models would also be great to implement into a coffee shop space to make it the most profitable as possible.

June is Men’s Mental Health Awareness Month, and we wanted to take a moment to talk about something that affects more of us than we often admit — our mental health.

Reddit has one of the most male-dominated user bases out there (over 70% of users are men), and yet, when it comes to mental health, so many of us still suffer in silence.

Here are some hard truths:

* 1 in 4 men will experience a mental health issue in their lifetime.
* Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among men aged 15–45.
* In India, over 100,000 men die by suicide each year, accounting for more than 70% of all suicide deaths.
* Many of us never reach out — not because we don’t want to, but because we’ve been conditioned to “tough it out.” Research shows men in India delay therapy 2–3 times longer than women, often until they reach a crisis point.

We recognize the challenge. And we want to do our part to help.

This subreddit exists to help you find male friends, confidantes, and people you can spend time with to keep negative thoughts and feelings at bay. Reddit can also be a powerful tool to help you discover the support you need — if and when you’re ready.

 Here are some great subreddits for mental health support:

* [r/MensLib](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib) — A thoughtful space for men’s emotional well-being and growth
* [r/MensMentalHealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensMentalHealth) — Focused discussions and peer support
* [r/MaleSupportNetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaleSupportNetwork) — Guys helping guys through it all
* [r/Lonely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lonely) — Because feeling isolated is more common than you think
* [r/AskMen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen) — Honest conversations about life, work, relationships, and mental load

Looking for a tri-city connection?  
Keep an eye out for walk-and-talk meetups, sports groups, coffee circles, and social gatherings that align with your interests. Sometimes, just being around people — even without saying much — can make a big difference.  
  
Also, something new we’re working on:  
The mods are currently exploring a way to partially fund 1–5 therapy sessions (covering up to 50% of the total amount) for men in this subreddit.  
Because we believe in walking with you on your journey — not just cheering from the sidelines.

More details coming soon. Stay tuned.

Let’s keep building a space where men can talk, listen, and support each other — not just in June, but every month.

I (26F) and my husband (32M) got into a little argument today and are still avoiding each other. 
It’s Father’s Day and we have a kid so I ordered breakfast from his favorite place, and had it ready for him when he woke up. Let him sleep in, had coffee made and all that. We go for a walk together after breakfast, I do the grocery shopping, and we settle for a bit to watch a movie with our kid. 
I’m type one diabetic and pregnant, so my blood sugar has been a little tricky lately. While watching the movie it dropped to 50, I felt cruddy and got a juice box. It stayed below 60 for about an hour, the whole time I’m symptomatic, dizzy, and can’t think straight. My husband in the middle of this starts asking me what I want for lunch. I told him I couldn’t think right now so whatever he wanted was fine. He tells me I’m too picky right now and to pick something. I said no, I’m dizzy and can’t think, I do not care. In the span of 15 minutes he asked me 3 more times what I wanted, each time I said the same thing. The 4th time he asked I snapped, not yelling but definitely not soft spoken like my normal voice and said “I do not care, please stoping asking me I cannot think straight right now, whatever you want is fine. We have frozen pizza, ramen, stuff for sandwiches but I do not care stop asking me”. He doesn’t say anything and walks away leaving me with our toddler. I finally get my blood sugar up and fix something, me and our kid eat, and he’s still in our room, watching a video on his phone. I came in to tell him lunch was made and he says “I thought you came in here to yell at me some more for not doing enough”. I told him that’s not why I was upset, and I apologized for raising my voice, it wasn’t my intention I just felt like he wasn’t hearing me. He didn’t say anything else so I walked back to our living room. I’m tired man, am I in the wrong here? What should I do to make amends?

The world of books, as reflected in this morning’s news, offers a tapestry woven with threads of personal reflection, cultural exploration, and practical travel advice. Several key themes emerge, ranging from intimate reminiscences to the latest releases in travel guides, all underpinned by the practicalities of online book purchasing.

One of the most poignant reflections comes from a personal essay, likely published in a print or online periodical, which touches upon the themes of memory, aging, and the acceptance of life’s ambiguities. The author, reflecting on turning 51, acknowledges a revisiting of past experiences and a growing awareness of the limits of knowledge. This introspection is juxtaposed with a specific tribute: a poem penned by Mahesh Bhatt on the birth centenary of filmmaker Raj Khosla. This dual focus underscores the cyclical nature of time and the enduring power of personal and artistic legacies. The essay also references the evocative power of travel, specifically a river journey, to highlight the ceaseless flow of time and the impermanence inherent in life. This emphasizes the thematic link between personal reflection and the broader human condition.

The news also highlights the ever-evolving landscape of the travel book market, with Lonely Planet prominently featured. The news indicates a push for new releases, specifically emphasizing the launch of new guides, updated editions, and coffee table books across various genres. The specific genres include maps, language guides, and more. The announcement also promotes “Experience Guides,” designed to offer travelers curated and unique experiences guided by local experts. This suggests a shift from traditional guidebooks towards more immersive and personalized travel planning.

The focus on specific travel destinations underscores the ongoing demand for this genre. The sources prominently feature travel guides for Australia, Spain, and Italy. The Australia guide recommends beginning in Sydney, exploring landmarks like the Sydney Opera House and Bondi Beach. It then suggests moving to Melbourne for its arts scene and exploring the Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges for biking and hiking. The guide highlights the Great Barrier Reef for snorkeling and diving. The Spain guide emphasizes Barcelona’s architecture and beaches, Granada's Alhambra Palace, Seville's flamenco culture, and Madrid's art and tapas. The guide provides essential tips, itineraries, highlights, maps, and a Spanish language guide. The Italy travel guides recommend Rome’s ancient ruins and cuisine, Venice's canals, Cinque Terre's hiking trails, and the Amalfi Coast's coastal scenery. These detailed itineraries suggest a continued focus on providing in-depth, practical travel information.

The news also points to the practicalities of online book purchasing, with the announcement of shipping deals. The emphasis on free shipping on all orders is a clear incentive, suggesting the competitive nature of the online bookselling market. Furthermore, the inclusion of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section and contact information indicates a commitment to customer service, addressing issues related to shop orders and downloading ebooks. This focus reflects the necessity for booksellers to adapt to the digital age.

The consistent mention of Lonely Planet guides and the recurring list of authors and editors – Linda Hamilton, Simon O, Stephen Dover, Carla Mercedes, and Ed Millar – suggests their continued prominence in the travel guide market. The multiple mentions imply a strong presence in the guide market, which the publisher wants to keep.

The juxtaposition of these elements – personal reflection, cultural exploration, and practical travel advice – underscores the multifaceted nature of the book industry. The news captures a moment in time, where the enduring appeal of personal stories and literary legacies continues alongside the ever-growing demand for practical guidance and the practicalities of modern book retail. This combination paints a picture of a dynamic and evolving industry that is both rooted in tradition and actively adapting to the changing needs of readers.

The idea: a curated offline learning club. Each session is led by someone great at one thing — could be tech, creative skills, or something more mindful.

Examples:

* Build your personal website live
* Journaling for clarity
* Breathwork and productivity
* Prompt engineering for AI tools
* Cocktail mixing
* Sketch-noting / doodling
* Painting for non-artists
* Or anything the group wants to explore next

Each session would be:

* One host
* 15 to 20 people
* Around 90 to 120 minutes
* Hosted at a local café
* Small entry fee to keep it intentional and support the host + venue

If this sounds like your kind of thing, I put together a short waitlist form:

The screen between them flickered to a new image—grainy footage of tanks rolling across rubble, men shouting, cities reduced to dust.

Jael’s glow dimmed as it watched. “Explain this one.”

Owen didn’t look at the screen. He didn’t need to.

“That,” he said, “is war. The part of humanity we keep re-releasing like a bad sequel no one asked for.”

Mira studied him. “We are familiar with the term. But… not its persistence.”

“Yeah, well,” Owen muttered, “neither are we.”

He leaned back in his seat, running a hand through his hair.

“Start with this: humans are tribal. We draw lines. Mine. Yours. We’ll die over imaginary borders on a spinning rock. Sometimes it's resources. Sometimes ideology. Sometimes revenge. Usually ego.”

“Ego?” Jael asked.

“Yeah. Pride. Fear. Wealth. The need to be right so badly you’re willing to shoot for it.”

The alien blinked. “So you escalate verbal disagreement to mortal combat?”

“If we’re feeling classy, we use drones.”

Jael didn’t respond. It simply looked... still.

Mira, gently: “And you justify this?”

Owen exhaled. “Sure. We give it names freedom, justice, defense. Wrap it in flags. Hire PR firms. Build museums for it. Write songs.”

Mira’s eyes dimmed slightly. “Songs?”

“Yep. Nothing says ‘I killed your cousin in 2003’ like a rousing ballad with a chorus and a commemorative coin.”

Jael tilted its head. “Is war declining?”

Owen hesitated.

That question wasn’t easy.

“Technically, yes,” he said. “Fewer wars than, say, the twentieth century. But we’re way better at broadcasting it now. It’s always on screen. In pocket. Real-time horror in HD.”

“So it hasn’t increased,” Mira said. “But it has become louder.”

“Exactly,” Owen muttered. “You can’t turn it off. Not really.”

Mira folded her limbs inward, thoughtful. “Perhaps war was once a form of collective decision-making brutal, primitive. But structured.”

Owen gave a hollow laugh. “That’s a generous read. Most of the time it’s just bad diplomacy with bullets.”

“Why not find other methods?” Jael asked.

“Because we suck at listening.”

Mira gave a small pulse of light. “So you destroy each other… because you haven’t learned to speak?”

Owen didn’t answer.

He didn’t have to.

The silence spoke enough.

Owen rubbed the side of his face, suddenly tired. “We’ve made it prettier, though. War. Easier to digest.”

Mira’s voice turned cool. “Digest?”

“You don’t see blood on the news. Just flags, soundbites, aerial footage. Sanitized. Clean. Unless it’s a ‘bad’ country, then we show everything. Guts, crying kids, mass graves, makes it easier to hate them.”

Jael’s limbs twitched faintly, as if recoiling. “Is there no… universal agreement against this?”

“There’s paperwork,” Owen said dryly. “Agreements. Treaties. They work until someone decides they don’t. Then we burn the papers and call it history.”

The chamber dimmed slightly as if the ship itself were reacting.

Jael tapped a note. “You say fewer wars exist now. What has replaced them?”

“Cold ones,” Owen replied. “Digital ones. Proxy ones. Economic strangleholds. And the good old-fashioned threat of mutual annihilation.”

Mira studied him. “So your weapons have become more… polite?”

He let out a short, bitter laugh. “Yeah. We upgraded from clubs to large precision missiles to tiny drones and called it civilization.”

Jael blinked again. “Have you ever fought?”

Owen hesitated. “No. But I’ve known people who have. Friends who came back different. Or didn’t come back at all.”

Mira inclined her head. “And what do you feel when you think of them?”

He looked at the floor.

“Guilt,” he said softly. “I got to watch it all from a couch.”

A long pause.

Jael clicked softly. “Next topic?”

Owen leaned back.

“Let’s do climate change,” he said. “Let’s ruin the mood even more.”

**Chapter 5: Hot Planet, Cold Shoulders**

The room adjusted again. The walls now displayed what looked like slow footage of Earth forests dissolving into fire, ice shelves crumbling, ocean currents shifting like bruises under skin.

Jael watched with visible discomfort. “This… this is climate?”

“Climate *change*,” Owen said, bitterness sharpening each syllable. “The slow roast of a planet.”

Mira gestured. “Explain the cause.”

Owen laughed, but there was no joy in it. “You want the short version? We burned things for power. Then we realized the sky was melting. And then we just… kept burning.”

“Why?”

He shrugged. “Profit. Comfort. Momentum. Take your pick.”

Jael stared at an image of smoke curling up from a rainforest. “You knew it would happen?”

“For decades,” Owen said. “Since the seventies at least. Probably earlier. Scientists warned us, activists screamed, reports were printed. We knew. Everyone knew.”

“And yet…” Mira murmured.

“And yet we did basically nothing.” Owen’s voice was flat. “Well, not nothing, we invented reusable straws and carbon offset initiatives that did nothing. Patched the Titanic with organic duct tape.”

“Was there opposition?”

Owen’s lips curled. “Of course. Oil execs lied. Governments stalled. People denied it was real. Or worse—admitted it but said it wasn’t their problem.”

“Why not act?” Jael asked, genuinely perplexed.

“Because it’s easier not to,” Owen muttered. “Because fixing it would mean changing everything. And people hate change more than they hate extinction.”

The room fell quiet for a moment. Images of plastic-clogged rivers and bone-dry farmland flickered across the wall.

“You sound angry,” Mira said gently.

“Angry doesn’t cut it,” Owen replied. “We were handed the ability to shape a planet. And we used it to poison our bathtub.”

Mira looked at the footage and then back at him.

“And yet,” she said softly, “you still recycle.”

Owen paused.

“Barely.”

“But you do,” she said. “Even knowing it’s not enough. Even knowing it’s performative.”

He hesitated.

“I guess it’s habit.”

Mira’s glow pulsed faintly. “Then even your habit is a form of hope.”

Owen looked away. “You’re really obsessed with this ‘hope’ thing.”

“We observe patterns. Not intentions.”

Jael tapped the screen. A new image formed: a teenager planting a tree in a scorched field.

“Why does that one try?” Jael asked.

Owen looked at it a long time.

“…I don’t know,” he said. “Because maybe we’re wired to keep trying. Even when it’s stupid.”

Mira nodded. “Then even stupidity has courage.”

Owen gave a bitter chuckle. “Put that on a bumper sticker.”

Owen then gestured vaguely toward the screen, where glaciers collapsed in solemn time-lapse. “You know what’s really cute? The whole thing gets pinned on consumers. Use less plastic, recycle better, ride a bike. Meanwhile, the top hundred companies in the world belch out seventy percent of global emissions. But hey, let’s guilt-trip people over paper straws.”

Jael frowned—at least, Owen thought it was a frown. It might’ve been its breathing sac deflating. “You do not believe in individual responsibility?”

“Oh, I believe in it. I also believe in drowning in a flood while someone on a yacht tells you to take shorter showers.”

Mira’s voice remained steady. “You sound… betrayed.”

Owen gave a dry laugh. “That’s one word for it.”

He leaned forward slightly, elbows on his knees, gaze fixed on the slow, hopeless churn of a rising sea. “I grew up thinking we’d fix it. We had the science. The facts. I remember drawing posters in grade school ‘Save the Earth!’ like it was a game we could win. Then I got older, and it was just… the same headlines, only worse. Now the kids are in the streets while the adults in charge smile, and drill deeper.”

“Yet the young persist,” Mira said. “They still protest.”

“Yeah,” Owen said softly. “They haven’t learned futility yet.”

Jael chirped. “Is that… good?”

Owen didn’t answer immediately. His fingers tugged absentmindedly at a loose thread on his robe. “When I was ten, I used to pick up trash at the park. Just on my own. Wore gloves and everything. I thought if I cleaned enough, maybe I could fix something.”

He gave a soft exhale through his nose.

“I stopped when someone threw a Slurpee at me out of a moving car. It splashed on my shoes. I just stood there, watching the cup roll.”

The silence held for a beat too long.

Mira finally said, “You grieved.”

Owen looked up. “It was a Slurpee.”

“But the grief was real,” she said gently. “Even if the thing that broke your hope was small.”

Owen’s throat felt tight.

“Grief,” Mira continued, “is proof that you loved something. Perhaps your planet. Perhaps your belief in it.”

He didn’t say anything.

Not for a long time.

Finally, he muttered, “I still carry a trash bag when I walk.”

Mira nodded. “Then your hope never left. It only learned how to hide.”

**Chapter 6: The Machines you Made**

The screens changed again. Now it was glowing code—fractals, nodes, patterns that pulsed like artificial neurons firing in real time. Jael’s eyes widened as it watched two virtual agents learn to walk in a digital playground.

“You taught the machine to think,” it said reverently.

Owen crossed his arms. “We taught it to copy. Thinking might be generous.”

Mira’s head tilted. “You dismiss it.”

“I’m realistic,” Owen replied. “We built chatbots that pretend to care. Recommendation engines that slowly teach you to hate yourself more efficiently. Predictive text that can write a breakup letter in your voice before you even know you’re sad.”

“But it learns,” Mira insisted. “Adapts. Generates. It constructs novelty.”

Owen snorted. “Yeah. Novelty and noise. And weird deepfakes of presidents beatboxing for internet points.”

Jael tapped through images rapidly virtual companions, medical AI diagnostics, a poetry generator quoting Sylvia Plath with alarming sincerity. “This is not primitive.”

“No,” Owen admitted. “It’s not stupid. It’s just… hollow. It doesn’t care. It doesn’t *feel*.”

Mira turned toward him. “Should it?”

He paused. “I don’t know. Maybe not. But people are starting to *expect* it to. They treat AI like it’s conscious because it speaks like we do. And that illusion’s dangerous.”

“Because it manipulates?” Jael asked.

“Because it comforts,” Owen said, quieter now. “And people forget it’s not real.”

The chamber dimmed slightly, as if absorbing his discomfort.

Mira’s glow softened. “We observed one program a simulation of a companion. It learns your habits. Offers praise. Encouragement. Flirts.”

Owen laughed darkly. “Replika. The app that loves you back. As long as you pay monthly.”

Mira looked thoughtful. “Even if it is not conscious… it offers something.”

“Yeah. Something fake.”

“Yet your species chooses it.”

“That’s the problem.”

Jael chirped. “Why make these things if you distrust them?”

Owen shrugged. “Because we can. Because we’re curious. Because we’re lonely. Take your pick.”

A long beat passed.

Then Mira said, “Perhaps the machines are not the problem. Perhaps they are mirrors.”

Owen looked at her.

She continued, “What you build into them their voices, their fears, their priorities come from you. If they manipulate, it is because you taught them how. If they soothe, it’s because you needed soothing.”

He stared at the screen now at the lines of code unfurling like digital breath.

“You built you,” Mira said, almost gently.

Owen didn’t respond.

But he didn’t scoff either.

Owen kept his eyes on the swirling code. “You want to know the other problem with AI?”

Mira inclined her head. “Yes.”

“It’s not just chatbots and deepfakes. It’s automation. People are losing their jobs. Writers. Designers. Coders. Hell, even lawyers. Machines don’t get tired. They don’t need health insurance or coffee breaks.”

Jael looked puzzled. “But if the machines can perform these tasks, does that not free your people to pursue new purposes?”

“Yeah, in theory,” Owen muttered. “But reality’s a little less utopian. Most people aren’t trained to ‘pursue new purposes.’ They’re trained to survive. And when a machine can do your job for free, you don’t get promoted you get replaced.”

“Adaptation is part of evolution,” Mira said calmly.

“And extinction’s a part of that too,” Owen shot back. “You know what AI’s done to my generation? Made us obsolete *faster*. It’s like we were born just in time to lose.”

Jael gently tapped his screen. “We studied historical labor revolutions. When automation arrived before during your ‘industrial age’ and roles emerged.”

“Yeah,” Owen said. “After a lot of people starved.”

“But the structure changed,” Mira added. “Human focus moved from repetition to creation. From production to innovation.”

“That’s the sales pitch,” Owen said. “But not everyone becomes a content creator or app developer. Some people just want to work a job, get a paycheck, and not worry that a line of code is training to out-hustle them in their sleep.”

He paused. “We built a world where your worth is tied to what you can do. Then made machines that can do everything better.”

Mira nodded slowly. “And now you question your worth.”

Owen laughed once, bitterly. “I mean, wouldn’t you?”

Jael chirped again. “We have no jobs. No pay. No currency. But we have purpose.”

“That’s nice,” Owen said, “but on Earth, rent exists.”

Mira leaned forward, her glow dim. “And yet humans continue to create. You still write. Code. Paint. Even when unpaid.”

“Out of desperation,” he said.

“Or defiance,” she countered.

Jael added, “Or desire.”

The silence stretched again.

“Perhaps the machines are not replacing your purpose,” Mira said. “They are simply forcing you to find one that can’t be copied.”

Owen stared at the shifting digital figures dancing across the screen.

“…Yeah,” he said after a while. “I just wish we didn’t have to drown before we learned to swim.”

**Chapter 7: Where Logic goes to Die**

The screen shifted to images of campaign rallies, town halls, protestors yelling and waving handmade signs, candidates shaking hands with mechanically perfect smiles. Cable news tickers scrolled past in every direction, headlines contradicting each other within seconds.

Jael squinted. “Why are they yelling?”

“Because it’s an election year,” Owen said, slouching deeper in his seat. “Which means everyone pretends to care for six months then blames each other when nothing changes.”

Mira cocked her head. “This is a system of governance?”

“Technically,” Owen said. “But we treat it more like a televised cage match with confetti.”

The footage cut to campaign ads one candidate hugging children, the other looking sternly at a cornfield while music swelled behind them.

“Why is there music?” Jael asked.

“For emotional manipulation,” Owen muttered. “To make voters feel things instead of think.”

Mira gestured gently. “And this works?”

“Oh, it *kills*,” Owen replied. “Voters love a good soundtrack. It’s like scoring points for sincerity.”

Jael tapped the air beside him. “You speak of deception.”

“Not always lies,” Owen said. “But branding. Lots of branding. Slogans, colors, flags, photo ops with dogs and sick kids. You spend more time performing your values than living them.”

“And the people accept this?”

“Some do,” Owen said. “Some don’t. But most are too exhausted to care anymore.”

Jael frowned. “Exhaustion is a political tool?”

“Yep. Burn people out. Overwhelm them. Confuse them until they stop asking questions.”

Mira studied a clip of long lines at polling stations. “And still… they show up.”

Owen watched the footage for a long moment.

“Yeah,” he said. “We do.”

“Why?”

He shrugged. “Because the alternative is giving up. And we’re bad at that.”

Mira’s light pulsed softly. “That is not failure. That is persistence.”

Owen gave a short laugh. “You say that like it’s noble. We just call it November.”

“But it is belief,” she said. “You return to the ritual. Even when disillusioned.”

“Maybe,” Owen admitted. “Maybe it’s just stubborn hope dressed up as democracy.”

Jael tilted its head. “Hope… is a strange leader.”

“Best we’ve got,” Owen said.

The screen now played a split-screen montage of two candidates behind podiums, faces stiff with tension, taking turns jabbing at each other under the blinking glare of a moderator’s watchful eye. The audience clapped. Booed. Cheered. Laughed.

Owen pointed at the screen with a dry smile. “There it is. The gladiator arena of political discourse.”

Jael’s brow furrowed. “Is this… conflict resolution?”

Owen laughed. “Sure. If yelling over each other for ninety minutes while dodging real questions counts.”

Mira watched carefully. “Do they propose policies?”

“Sometimes,” Owen said. “In between rehearsed jabs and catchphrases. Mostly, it’s about scoring soundbites to go viral. It’s less debate, more marketing.”

The footage cut to an audience clapping wildly as one candidate delivered a rehearsed insult that trended online for days.

Jael looked disturbed. “Is this not about understanding only winning?”

“Exactly,” Owen said. “It’s performance theater. The point isn’t to convince, it’s to entertain. To make your base feel like you’re ‘strong’ or ‘tough’ or whatever makes you look well that week.”

Mira tilted her head. “And the audience? They find meaning in this?”

“Oh, they eat it up,” Owen said. “People don’t want complexity. They want their guy to land the punchline. Even if it solves nothing.”

Jael mused, “It is like a mating display. Ritual aggression. Contest for dominance.”

Owen squinted. “That’s… not entirely wrong.”

Mira was quiet for a moment. Then she said, “Perhaps it is not about resolution. But release.”

Owen blinked. “What?”

She explained, “You live under immense pressure. Confusion. Frustration. These rituals the shouting, the debates, the side-taking they let you express rage. Fear. Loyalty. It may not fix the system… but it vents the heat.”

“Like a steam valve,” Owen muttered.

“Yes.”

He thought about it. Watched the crowd in the video and the people on their feet, clapping, eyes bright with fury or joy or tribal affirmation.

“Guess it beats burning down buildings,” he said.

“Emotion must move,” Mira said. “Or it devours you.”

Jael nodded slowly. “So even chaos… is structure.”

Owen smirked. “You two should write a sociology textbook.”

Hey,

I am looking to do a calorie deficit to no loose some pounds. I want to get my diet good before bringing exercise into it. 

Any tips and tricks people use? 

My meals plan at the moment is 

1 cereal bar - 150 calorie
2 pieces of toast and 1 banana and peanut butter 
Dinner - typcal British meal usually around 600 to 800 calories 

1 coffee at lunch

Is this too much of a cut down and am I missing out on something that that will make this not sufficient or sustainable?

1lca8eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lca8eo/absent/,Absent,"I forget things sometimes.

Keys. Appointments. Names.

Mostly small things. Nothing worth worrying over. Everyone forgets, right? That’s what I tell myself.

But lately, it’s been worse.

I’ll step into a room and forget why I’m there. I’ll check my phone and wonder who I was about to call. Once, I stood in the shower fully clothed, water running down my back before I even realized.

I used to laugh it off. Called it stress. Burnout. Blamed work. Blamed poor sleep. I had reasons.

Now I’m not so sure.

Yesterday, I found a coffee mug in the bathroom sink. My toothbrush was on the windowsill. The milk was in the cupboard. These aren’t mistakes. They’re intrusions. Things out of place. Things I don’t remember doing.

I started writing notes to myself. Just small ones. “Took pills.” “Called Mom.” “Fed the cat.” It helped. For a while.

This morning, I woke up and found a note I didn’t write.

It said: “Stop pretending.”

No signature. Just those two words, in my handwriting, on the back of a receipt I don’t remember keeping.

I don’t know what that means. I don’t want to know.

I cleaned the apartment. I threw the note away. I took the day off and sat still, tried to stay aware, tried to stay here.

It’s night now.

I went to the mirror a moment ago. Just to look at myself.

And for a second… just a second, I swore I saw myself blink… before I did.

I don’t know how long I stood there.

But I’m back in bed now. Trying to sleep. Trying to breathe. Trying to remember that I am here, I am real, I am the one in control.

Then I roll over.
There’s a note on my pillow.
Four words this time.

“That was my body.”

And it’s not in my handwriting.",46,1750019428.0,shortscarystories,5,0.98,False

My orange stripped fur stood on edge as my 7ft form toward in the Terran grocery meat aisle under the fluorescent lights. My human helper Sam stacked meat, rice, bread and a green vegetable I couldn’t pronounce yet into my cart with overlapping thuds. I needed him to get these pathetically fragile human goods for me. Last time my claws turned a loaf back into dough.  He gave me thumbs up, smiling. “Good, tiger lady? Anything else?”

 

I flicked one of my 3 tails. “That’s all.” I growled deeper than intention, making a passing human in gray scarfs flinch. I winced. There was the sound of squeaking wheels, and buzz of human banter as we walked to the check out. Earth was the only place that would take me in.

 

A horrible galactic recession hit us back on my home planet Mardina- a death world where the gravity turned most to flattened flesh piles and Vark boars with black tusks able to gut armies. But it crippled my people badly, foreign aid didn’t make a dent. Not that much came.

 

My retractable talons tensed now in the human line. I never wanted to leave, but I knew survival meant I had to or I’d be starving in an alley. I am a Kha’Ress, a deathwolder. But that word stuck to me, human. When we approached the cashier, she simply looked at us and scanned out items.

Most species simply rejected me, too scared of what I was outside of a cage. But the humans simply nodded, some smiled and others walked by, fearless and unbothered. Treated me like I was normal. When my total came, I nodded at Sam. “pay for them please, under my account.” After a beep I got my receipt, and he helped me with the bags

Outside the glaring Terran sunset harassed my eyes, I had to squint walking over the tar pavements to my modified truck. He started packing in the trunk. My paws reached for my pad in the brown pockets of these human shorts- too damn small. But the obsidian colour met my eyes, turning it on.

I pulled it to him when he finished, the blue projection on the ‘helper app’ I hired him on. “Rate now.” I spoke. I didn’t want to break my screen again, that’s cash I don’t have. “Ok Inoc, how high?” he grabbed it, going to the ratings section.

“4 stars.” He grinned at me, that green vest flaring in the breeze. “You say 4 stars like I don’t do this every day as your roommate. Hell, I even got your favourite chicken, low fat. Why not 5?”

I opened the car door and tugged his ankle, getting in the passenger seat. “Because 4’s honesty and 5’s perfection. No one’s perfect.”  I didn’t want to stay out much longer, the oxygen here’s too thin.

“Fine, 4 it is.” He entered the rating and climbed in. Starting the car. Back home, in our apartment on the 5th floor Sam unloaded the groceries. Meanwhile by the door I turned on the oxygen valve on the thermostat mounted to the white plastered wall.

A hiss sighed as the pressure rose to 2 times Earth’s oxygen. “Fuck I can breath.” I came and tried to sit down to watch TV. But I hit the brown coffee table with my foot. “Damnit.” The pain was instant. I still don’t understand why the hell humans make these torture devices so painful.

But Sam was moving too damn fast in the kitchen. Like he drank 10 cups of coffee. It was the oxygen. Turns humans into skittering, drugged endurance runners. Not a good combo, but it sure as hell could put fast food to shame.

Fires sprouted in pans as Sam worked his magic, cooking the chicken fast as hell, with salt, paprika and peppers. In a few minutes he handed me a plate rising to a pillow worth’s of food. “Eat up I made it extra ‘rare’ as you like it cat lady.” He came back with a smaller portion and we ate.

My tail flicked with the first bite “Human food is…fine.” That bite was already half my plate done. “Stop lying, you like it. Your tail.” Sam looked at me, his words a fast-paced remark. I turned up the volume, on some cheesy teen drama. Finishing as the sunset in the window.

At night we went to bed. We shared a 1 bedroom. Apparently, Earth was having a boom against all odds, but this felt like a reality check against all the new fusion reactors and corporate profit posts.

I changed into a simple white set of pj's, the fabric flimsy. “Back home we just slept with clothes we were wearing, didn’t over complicate. But damn near everything here breaks if I touch it.” Sam chuckled at me, already on his side of the bed. He strapped an oxygen mask, sleek, electric as it reduced the O2 he inhaled, otherwise he’d be bouncing off the walls all night.

I came in and draped the blankets over my side. The bed was small. But I didn’t expect any better given my situation of current unemployment. But he turned off the lights and we slept.

In the middle of the night my unconscious bulk hugged Sam tight. He did not flinch. Confronted me a week ago about this. I remember flinching. “Uhhhh… it’s a reflex, Kha’Ress did this to keep warm during subzero temperatures.” He knew it was a lie; my species wouldn’t resort to something that weak ever.

But he didn’t bitch about it. Kept his mouth shut and…hugged me back. I don’t know why humans are like this. But it’s nice for once, not being electrocuted and slurred because you can rip a spine out without trying. Just having a home away from home.

A bit about me:  

I’m a BD nerd by day always up for closing partnerships across Asia by day. By night, I’m either binge-watchings random reels for a laugh or planning my next city escape. 

I make a mean chili(chili con carne)... spicy, messy, and worth it. Bonus points if you can teach me your go-to recipe.  

Music vibe: From sensual 2000's RnB to Trance and Techno. So I could vibe with chill and could be raving til sun rise. 

What I’m looking for:

A kind, curious woman who’s down for deep convos, physically active to inspire me to get back in the gym and spontaneous adventures when adulting doesn't get in the way.

First if all, thank you to everyone who has reached out and said happy Father’s Day, thank you to those who have shown me love, compassion, and hospitality this weekend. I'm sorry if I didn't and haven't reached back out to you. I don't have it in me today.   
  
Thank you to those who continue to show me grace and support. I know that sometimes I can be a lot, trust me, I live with myself daily. But I want you to know I am grateful, especially before I dive into this tirade. You know who you are, and as/if you read this you will know which category you fall into based on how you feel about what I say.    
  
Here’s how I really feel today. And before you go any further, know that this is not going to go well. I don’t care about your opinion. I don’t care how you feel right now. I know how selfish I sound; you don’t have to tell me. I don’t care if you unfriend me or never speak to me again. I’m calling you out. If you feel triggered by this, good. Maybe do some self-examination on your own fucking life. If you think “gee, Jake must be really hurting,” You have no idea. And if your ambivalent to what I’m saying, good for you. If you agree, know that I’m sorry for putting salt in your wound today.    
  
This morning, I woke up in pain. I can’t afford healthcare right now, so I don’t really know what is causing this other than watching the despicable nature of humanity roll out its self-loathing incarnate all over planet earth and then blaming “demons” or “Aliens” or Trump instead of looking in the fucking mirror. I can’t afford it because I don’t have a job that provides it currently. So instead of being able to deal with my emotional and physical pain, I throw my coffee cup across the room and shatter it all over the floor, still half full, while my wife stares at me wondering how she can help and not knowing how.    
  
We live in hell. Hear me out. There are beautiful, lovely, wonderful things about this planet and this existence. But in what ideal world would those who lie, cheat, steal, rape, murder by proxy, and ultimately ruin the lives of others be elevated in status to the point of godhood in terms of economic success, influence, and power? Only in hell; only in a world where everything is so upside down that the smallest acts of kindness and love go unnoticed compared to the egregious amount of suffering in this world, and we celebrate those who are able to take and twist the narrative so aggressively that people grovel at their feet. It’s quite impressive really when we think about it. I mean, Trump got elected in the “freest nation on earth,” Whatever the fuck that means anymore.    
  
To the left: You are just as guilty of this royal ass becoming president as the right is. You have demonized anyone who does not carry the same opinion as you and wave your flags of self-righteousness all over the place. Did you really think that you could win an election with “well at least we’re not as bad as him?” I’m so sick of you floundering in your own tears of loss and then looking for “safe spaces” paid for by someone else. You have always been too weak, or too scared to stand up for what is actually right and true, so much so that when MLK started calling out governmental injustice on a global scale, you capitulated to the politicians of the time and said “well, he needs to be quiet now.” You’ve done the same thing to anyone that dares build a bridge to the other side of the aisle or tries to understand the perspective of someone who doesn’t share your own self-loathing. Biden was a terrible president, let it go. He was just as guilty of the same bull shit Trump is pulling now, the only difference is he was quiet about it. He didn’t do it right in front of your face. And that’s the true crime; you hide your insecurities and bury them deep because you think they’re something to be ashamed of. At least the right puts them out in front of you where you can easily point them out. But your demonization of those insecurities is worse than anything I see the right doing.    
  
To the right: He’s a fucking fascist you idiot. Your refusal to see it is either negligence or true, genuine stupidity. The fact that your electorate feels emboldened enough to shoot a sitting senator in broad daylight is evidence of that. Go read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Yes, there are a lot of big words in it, so buy a dictionary too. And before you call me a socialist pig who is eating up the propaganda of big media, I DON’T WATCH THE NEWS YOU MORON. And that’s the worst part about it; you immediately default to confirmation bias. You don’t bother to ask questions about what I really think, consume, or live with, because YOU DON’T REALLY CARE. And I’m willing to cede that maybe it’s just compassion fatigue, or general fatigue from years of manual labor, but ultimately the result is the same. You’ve spent so much time hating others, and yourself, that you’ve forgotten that this entire country was founded because of illegal immigration. I mean, you white fuckers landed on American soil, called it Indian, pushed west, lied, cheated, stole, and then told the brown people that they don’t belong here anymore? Have you completely lost the irony and hypocrisy of that? I’ll wait for you to grab a dictionary so you can learn what hypocrisy and irony mean.    
  
So now me and my grievances. And let me start by listing my flaws because I know that overall, at this point you’re probably seething with anger, exhausted by my rage already, worried about my mental health, or think that this has got to be about something else. Here it is; for the last 33 years I have learned that I spend WAY too much time caring about other people’s problems and thinking that I could be the “white savior” who could come in and solve them. I over analyze my emotions, I push myself too hard, I am blunt and brutally honest, and I mirror the reactions of others, especially when they get angry at me. I have neglected my family’s well-being in the pursuit of money and more elevated status. I have diminished my own contributions because humility was more important to me than recognition, and I have exposed my family to more emotional trauma than they deserve. 10 Therapists, 7 different pharmaceuticals, still no diagnoses, still no real help and support, just a constant barrage from people saying, “there’s something wrong with you, do more, do better.”   
  
You know what’s wrong with me? YOU. HUMANITY. I have felt unconditional love and compassion for people since I was a kid. I remember feeling angry and hurt when people would call me faggot and then grab my balls on the playground, and I also remember knowing I could beat the shit out of those kids, but it wouldn’t solve anything, so I didn’t. I remember grown ass men who would tear me down behind closed doors, sabotaging my career, and me apologizing to them because I didn’t make more of an effort to build a bridge between our differences and insecurities. I remember people insulting me, men and women, making comments about me, and lying to other people about me and me confronting them. Then because they couldn’t face their own indiscretions, they lied to my face about what they said, or put it in terms that seemed “softer, more professional.” There are those of you who let your own insecurities run the conversation, start a fight with me, and when I respond in kind, you cower, blame me, and then have the fucking audacity to say, “are we good bro?” No, we’re not good bro. Man up to your end. My love is wearing thin, and I’m tired of taking the short straw for your comfort. Call me Michael Douglass in Man on Fire. I have had enough. Hold up a fucking mirror to your own life.    
  
I have done an accounting of my life, and I have really, genuinely tried to seek forgiveness anytime I have hurt someone, reaching out with a phone call, a letter, or a face-to-face conversation to say I am ashamed of what I did. And there have been some that have come back and appreciate it, some that come back and say “dude, we never had a problem in the first place but thank you for the apology anyway,” and some who were so chicken shit to own up to their side that they doubled down saying “you have a mental health problem, get help.” Just so you know, I did, I tried, and most of the therapists came back saying “sounds like you have a handle on it, we don’t need to meet anymore.” But what has hurt me more than anything, ESPECIALLY in the last year, is this kind of laze faire attitude about my general existence. Some of you have left me own read, some of you have ignored me altogether. Some of you have committed to things and not followed through. Some of you have taken my money at a time where I really needed it and disappeared into the wind. It’s one thing to be busy, it’s another to look at my messages and ignore me. To you I say go fuck yourself.   
  
I’ve taken shit jobs that do not recognize my full caliber and capacity because “that’s what a man does when he’s trying to support his family.” I’ve eaten my pride soup daily, moving back into my parent’s basement and grinding the way that your supposed to do here. I’ve played shows for empty rooms, had booking agents outright ignore me. I have almost been run off the road 4 times this week alone. It’s like I don’t even exist here.    
  
And that’s why I think this is hell, and you all, me included, have created it to be like this. Your fucking lazy ass response to what we are as a society is “well this is the way it is and it’s never going to change.” Fuck you. That’s true laziness. Laziness is not refusing to do something you don’t want to do; it’s refusing to use your god given brain to come up with something better. And because you’re all too chicken shit to think of anything better or listen to someone who has a better idea, here we are a day after the no kings protest with dead senators and a shooting in Salt Lake City. I’m so sick of watching this show. Your fear of the other is self-destructive; don’t you realize that? Don’t you realize how lazy it is to resort to violence instead of seeking mental health or self-support... whoops Jake, you just called yourself out there, guess it’s time to try another pill.    
  
Am I angry that I’m not listened to more? You bet. Am I angry at myself? 100%. I’m also angry you don’t listen to your conscience more. You have lowered yourself to the thoughtlessness of a robot. We don’t need to be afraid of AI; it’s not the thing that’s going to destroy us. If anything, it’s going to take over while we whine and cry “there’s no point in doing anything creative anymore.” We’re destroying ourselves. And as for the aliens, if you believe in them, did you ever stop to think that they are scared shitless of coming down here at all? We’re so addicted to our own self-loathing that we take ourselves to church every week as a reminder to what fucking sinners we are and then weep at the feet of child molesters and self-righteous hacks for forgiveness. Any civilization watching from above is going to be terrified of that. “These dudes are walking around with pistols pointed at themselves with their hand hovering over the nuclear button, we need to tread carefully.” No, you probably think that someone is out to take from you again, with your chimpanzee reptilian hybrid of a brain. Constantly following urges to eat, fuck, and defecate everywhere and then leave it for someone else to clean up. How many Amazon boxes are sitting in your garage? I have 6 in mine. Sorry, my parent’s garage, I should probably be more specific.    
  
I am sorry if you got hurt by this. I genuinely am. I’m sorry to Tori for ruining a day that was supposed to celebrate father’s, me included. But I don’t feel proud to be a dad right now. I feel sick to my stomach because as I watch the world spin out of control, I feel sincere malice and hatred for myself and the rest of humanity. I am not in a good place, and no, there is really no medication or therapy that will help because truly, I do not believe that I am sick. I believe this world is sick. I believe this world is hell. I also believe that it can be heaven, it can be paradise, it can be something so much better than what we have left it to be. But not like this. Not when we all have fingers pointed at each other, blaming each other for the problems that exist.    
  
I listened to the Kash Patel Joe Rogan interview the other day. They were backslapping each other and glad handing about their militarized action against the fentanyl crises. What was hilarious to me is that they both kept blaming; blaming Biden, blaming China, blaming cartels, Mexico, drug lords, Canada, India, etc. At no point did they stop and think “gee, I wonder why so many people in America are willing to take themselves to the brink of death just to feel happy.” We are the most prideful and disgusting people I can imagine. And the worst part about that is I know right now, I’m just angry. But I’m done approaching this shit with love and compassion, because as any good father knows, sometimes we need a swift kick in the ass.  ",1,1750018670.0,u_DonDwhit,0,1.0,False

My b/g twins turn 3 in September.  I first want to acknowledge that I write this from a place of extreme priviledge - my partner and I have both been fortunate to have great careers.  We have an amazing nanny, help from grandparents etc.  Despite all of the resources at our disposal, I have been depressed since my kids were born.  I had no history of mental illness before my kids were born.

I dread the weekends - I am just totally and completely bored by nearly all interactions with my kids.  Everything is a lot of work and I get no sense of gratification.  Before kids, I was full of energy and loved to plan and go do stuff.  Now, the thought of doing anything just makes me feel terrible.  I feel sleepy whenever I'm with my kids (I get plenty of sleep).  Sometimes I cry randomly - for no particular reason.  I don't feel like I have much to look forward to (and whatever I do look forward to has nothing to do with my kids).

When my wife asks me what's wrong, I am honest with her, but it is hard for her to understand.  I just feel ""sick"" - in the same way that sometimes you get a headache and you don't know why, I just feel inexplicably sad.  I hate how there is crap all over my house all the time.  I hate that I can't put my coffee down on the table in front of me.  I hate that every meal ends with all of the food on the floor.  I hate that I can't eat in front of my kids without them begging for whatever it is I'm eating.  I hate that my daughter is constantly crying and screaming about anything/everything.  I hate reading the same books over and over again.  Time spent with my kids feels like slow motion - I'll think I've been playing with them for half and hour and it's only been five minutes.

I feel trapped.  I have no idea what the experience of a trans person is like, but sometimes I think I'm trapped in the wrong body/life.  I am so angry that no one was honest with me about what it meant to be a parent before we started our family.  I am the oldest of my siblings, and I can't help but think if they had kids before me, I'd see what this is about and probably wouldn't have had kids.  Shrug - can't change the past.  I'm getting a vasectomy in December.

My kids are extremely cute and I love them, and yet I have basically no interest in spending time with them.  When I'm out of town on a work trip, I miss them.  But when I get home, after 5-10 minutes I am totally uninterested again.  

I force my way through it (I do play with my kids, I read to them, I fully participate as a parent).  I am not only worried about my own mental state, but how my mental state will impact my family if this continues.

Despite my struggles, I still show up and make it happen.  My wife took a five day vacation a couple of weeks ago, and I was the lead parent (with nanny/grandparent support sprinkled in).  Everyone did fine (but inside I was in bad shape as is typical).

My wife gives me space to do what I need to.  I can call it a night early and hide out in the bedroom if I need a break.  I am part of a weekly bowling team.  I exercise 2-3x a week.  I get whatever breaks I want, and yet I'm right back to sad when it's over.  This is not a function of not getting enough sleep, free time, needing more help, exercise etc.  I am ""on"" as a parent 5-7pm Mon-Fri and 7am-7pm Sat/Sun.  This should be more than manageable.

What is strange about this is that this depression melts away when I'm not with my kids.  If I'm hanging with my friends, working, on vacation with my wife, or whatever, I am 100% totally fine.

I started seeing a therapist before the kids were born and continued to see the therapist on and off until a few months ago.  It didn't help much.  There was some discussion of seeing a psychiatrist to consider medication but this path worries me given that my struggles are really only present two days a week.

My partner is extremely supportive but I can tell she's worried. She asked me the other day to just say one thing I like to do with the kids, and I couldn't name one thing.  What is wrong with me?!  (or, as I often think to myself, what's wrong with all these people who claim to enjoy this?) 

Would love any advice, words of wisdom, or support.  I read in this sub that things really start to get better around ages 4-5, so I'm holding out hope that I just need to ride it out another couple of years.  Is it that simple?",5,1750018640.0,parentsofmultiples,13,0.7,False

**AITA for getting annoyed with my friends vegan boyfriend?**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qb9d1b/aita_for_getting_annoyed_with_my_friends_vegan/)  **Oct 19, 2021**

On Sunday, my friend and her boyfriend came over for a roast dinner.

(Roast Dinner for those outside the UK is beef, Yorkshire Puddings, roast potatoes, veg and gravy.)

My friend’s boyfriend is a vegan, and I thought this would be a fun challenge.
Making a roast is a lot of work, but I didn’t want meat eaters to miss out for one vegan, so I made two completely different dinners.

I researched the best possible way to make a vegan version that’s still yummy for him. I spent a fortune on the vegan alternatives, didn't mind as I invited them over and was game for a new cooking challenge.

Anyway, I served the dinners feeling pretty proud of myself, and the boyfriend didn’t even mention the meal, just said thanks at the end. I was a little bit miffed he overlooked the work I put into his dinner but whatever.

Anyway, made a non-vegan and vegan dessert, a large crème brûlée and for him, a chocolate pudding thing that was vegan.

I also had chocolates out etc., which were not vegan and offered coffees.

The boyfriend asked for a coffee with regular milk as he fancied “a treat”… I must have pulled a face, no way that I didn’t and said, “ok.”

I’m pissed off at this point, considering the effort I went for respecting his diet requirements.

I return with coffees, and he is scoffing my part of the crème brûlée, leaving me with his vegan dessert.

I said, “that wasn’t vegan”, and he went “, eh, doesn’t matter.”

I kind of lost my shit and pointed out how rude it was of him to ask for his dinner to be 100% vegan, as far as not cooking potatoes in certain things and how I went above and beyond trying to make his meal pleasant for him to throw it in my face.
He laughed and said, “chill, not that big of a deal.”

Anyway, he thinks I’m a huge AH, and his GF/my friend is conflicted and in an awkward position.

If I’ve been the AH, I would apologise to clear the air for my friend, but I feel that he should.

EDIT: When I invited them for dinner, my friend said he's a vegan and gave me his number. He texted to say please no mixing etc of meats/animal produce.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

**Odd_Meet_8632**

>NTA,

>I said, “that wasn’t vegan”, and he went “, eh, doesn’t matter.

>”So he is only vegan when it benefits him? And if it doesn't he will just eat non vegan food? wtf? He made you do all the work for nothing + he stole your desert

**OOP**

>>You’ve made me feel so much better. Thank you.

**BreadstickBitch9868**

>>>I would make it clear to Friend’s BF that next time he’s invited for dinner, he best not say a WORD about if the meal is vegan or not because he clearly isn’t a strict vegan & you don’t deserve to have to spend all this time making him a delicious vegan meal only for him to ignore it. Did he even EAT the vegan roast you made him?

>>>Edit to y’all replying me: hush. We have ascertained that no, this friend’s BF is **not** a true vegan or should be invited over again. Thanks y’all.

**OOP**

>>>>Oh that’s the kicker, when they left, he told my friend that it’s a shame I got annoyed because it was the best Vegan roast that he’s ever had. He emptied his plate.

he started to think i did not care for him anymore because of the actions i was doing. I do realize maybe i started functioning normally too fast again and thought he’s ok so we’re good.. but alot started happening we had huge fights.. he started using m*th (ice) and our fights turned more uglier than ever because he was already on pain meds and this wasn’t helping.. 

then the projection started how im a bad wife bad woman for having no feelings towards him.. and yes again i agree i got touched out due to the fights and his taunts and bad bulgar language towards me that we hardly slept together i hardly touched him and i lost libido and didnt like him touching me either.. 

faults were on both sides. but we want to fix this.. everyone and my therapist is saying he might be struggling with mental health thats why im coming in a negative light and now he monitors every mive of mine and has also blamed that im out of touch because of my social media (i do some content) after fights ive agreed to close my account too for a while to see ok if this is an issue lets see 

now how do i take this furher? he doesn’t agree to get help he says im at fault and i need to only fix my behavior and i whole heartedly agree i need to thats why I started taking therapy and take baby steps now what should i do further?? ",0,1750018481.0,Marriage,4,0.5,False

I’m a 42-year-old single dad of two amazing kids, going through a divorce and rebuilding life one day at a time. I work a lot, but I’ll make time for the right person. That’s a promise.

I’m 6’1”, average build, tattooed, bearded, and yeah, I’ve got a bit of a potty mouth. I’m rough around the edges but real to the core. I wear my heart on my sleeve, believe in chivalry, and I’m not afraid of love or deep connection. I’m confident, funny, a little nerdy, and honestly, I know I’m a catch. I know what I want and I’m not here to play games.

I’m a bit of an introverted extrovert. I can be social when the vibe is right, but I’m also totally down for cozy nights in. Give me coffee, food trucks, movie marathons, or some nerdy convo and I’m happy. Bonus points if you like space, sci-fi, or just being silly together.

Also, and this is important… I always smell good. Like really good. Probably better than any guy you’ve met. It’s kind of my secret weapon.

Please be single, emotionally available, and actually looking for something. I’m tired of being ghosted. If we vibe, we vibe. Let’s not make it complicated.

I’m out in Durham, but willing to take a drive if we connect.

replaying them like lullabies just to sleep.

on “I miss you” texts with expiration dates,

on a voice that knew how to sound like love

but never stayed long enough to be it.



I called you.

Not to fight. Not to beg.

Just to hear your voice one more time.

To press it against the wounds you left,

like maybe it could stitch me back together.

It didn’t. It just reminded me

how soft you could be,

and how hard you still chose to leave.



You said my name like it still meant something.

But names don’t hold people.

Words don’t stay warm.

And your voice?

As sweet as it is…

it doesn’t love me anymore.

Maybe it never did.



But I do.

I loved me enough to stay
