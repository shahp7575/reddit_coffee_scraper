After our conversation everything seemed to be normal, we made w puzzle, watch movies , went out for coffee and talked about mental health and healthy lifestyle, she was so understanding and accepting of my advice ( her lifestyle is not necessarily healthy, she doesn’t eat ""good"" foods, fruits/veggies , doesn’t drink enough water, doesn’t workout or move her body, after uni she is in her room on her computer all day and doesn’t get out other than to go to the bathroom or eat ) we talked about making hobbies , discussed interests offline ones that she may like and want to try.

Yesterday she craved ice cream , we went to get some and while we were eating , me and mom were having normal conversation about my long flight here, about the state of the country I live in , nothing unusual, my sister didn’t say a work but was clearly in her thoughts, mom asked her if everything okay , she said she will tell us later and can’t talk right now , when i insisted she told me that she understands the masterplan as she was smiling, we came home she sat next to me and said she knows I know what she is talking about, I told her I don’t and she was so confused, she made a remark that she doesn’t trust us now and we have to wait a week until she is sure about what she knows.

Mom took her to psychologist and a psychiatrist, ( before my initial conversation with her ) the psychologist was a terrible experience for her ( from her words ) 
The psychiatrist gave her some antidepressants but she isn’t taking them, refuses to and says she is great and feeling okay.

Please help, how should we behave with her ?

*Somewhere on Highway 26.*

 

“Course, I didn’t even see him come up on me, too busy trying to put my tent together, I just heard my brother shout *‘Howard! Turn around!’* and sure enough when I turned there was the biggest alligator I ever seen with my ankle between his teeth and I pulled that leg out just before he went *snap*! The teeth caught the sole of my shoe and ripped it right off my foot!” Howard laughed, wiping a tear from his eye.

I was laughing too.

“What did you do next?”

Howard looked at me and shook his head. “You wouldn’t even believe it…”

“I would!” I insisted, eager to hear how his story ended.

Howard’s eyes lifted from the road as if to look up and retrieve the memory from the stars.

“I lept over my tent, just stood there frozen staring at this monster and he is staring at me, and I tell you this alligator laughed.”

“Laughed? Alligators can’t laugh!” I refuted.

“This one did.” Howard assured me, “*Ha-Ha-Ha*, like that…. Then it just backed into the water again, disappeared completely, not a bubble. I said to my brother, “*Get me the hell out of here, that damn gator can keep the shoe!*”

A green sign materialized out from the darkness.

**Taghorn: 20 Miles**

**Garden Rock: 80 Miles**

**Lakesville: 170 Miles.**

Howard checked his watch and yawned.

“Good diner up in Taghorn, you like eggs?” He asked.

I shrugged, “Yeah I guess.”

“I could do with some coffee.”

I looked out to a passing country shrouded in darkness to reveal nothing of where we could be. A ghostly reflection of myself stared back through the window and I could see Howard staring behind me. I looked at him, and his eyes were on the road again.

“Are you from Eastpoint?” I asked him.

“Who me? Yeah, could say I am.” He answered.

“But you were going to Lakesville?”

“That’s correct. I’m in between at the moment. Got some family up there I’m gonna stay with over the weekend. It’s my brother’s birthday actually.”

“I feel like I’ve seen you before.” I said to him, something familiar about this person driving like a puzzle piece that fit somewhere in memory. Talkative Howard paused, he heard me but did not answer straight away, he glanced at the rearview mirror and cleared his throat.

“It’s possible.” He muttered. “It’s a small town.”

“I’m worried that my parents tried to pick me up, or that I was wrong about this whole thing.” I admitted.

Howard was letting another car overtake him.

“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m sure that was their initial plan, but stuff *does* happen. Hell, my folks left me in some places.” He chuckled.

In the distance I could see glowing dots appearing down the hill. A small town. Taghorn.

When we pulled into the dirt parking lot, the neon sign of the diner was like a stellar beacon on a dark planet, as if trucks bound for the Las Vegas strip had it fall from their cargo and here it stayed, repurposed. There were a few cars already parked, the car that passed us was getting gas at the station further down. In the window of the diner some lone travelers held cutlery to pancakes and from their coffee cup’s steam rose to form apparitions of ghostly company in their solitary booths. An old man sat hands clasped to his chin, pondering the limited future and thanked a waitress with a nod.

I unbuckled my seatbelt, but Howard stopped me.

“Wait in the car, little miss, I’ll bring you back some eggs.”

He opened the door and left for the diner, leaving me with the rhythmic vibrations of the idling engine. As he walked hands hidden in his jacket pockets, a couple stopped him.

They seemed to recognize him as smiles formed on their faces, and they were quick to shake hands. They stood talking. Howard pointed back at his car with me inside and the couple turned to look and waved at me. I waved back. Howard said a last goodbye to them as he opened the diner’s door. The couple got inside a truck and then their taillights passed into the night as another thing devoured.

Howard disappeared into the diner and I sat waiting. Boredom turned into curiosity, so I looked behind at the back seat. There was a canvas gym bag, a black pen, a stained baseball cap and the crumpled leftovers of a drive-thru dinner and receipts. I turned the dial of the radio and a roar of static came through, but also a man’s voice:

‘*(***Inaudible***)’s Estate has urged the thief to come forward and return the remains of (***Inaudible***) to the (***Inaudible***) Memorial Gardens in Hollywood.*’

I turned the radio off again, the signal was still awful.

I looked at the dashboard behind the steering wheel and saw a gas tank over half full and a picture of a woman, a crease ran through her face like the image was mostly kept folded. I studied the black scuff marks on the glove compartment in front of me, struck into plastic like the scratched tallies of a jailcell calendar. I looked at the footwells, and that’s when I saw a piece of pink fabric wedged beneath his seat.

Curious, I leant over and pinched the cloth between my fingers and pulled it free where it un-scrunched and fell into its shape, where to my horror, I saw it was a pair of my missing underwear.

I wanted to be wrong, that they were not mine. I had not seen that pair for over a week and hoped by some strange, concerning coincidence, I had found ones that were the exact pattern and size that I had blamed the other orphaned girls for stealing.

At that age, my gut feeling knew more than I did, and I should have listened to it. If I could go back, I would have run from that car. I would have gone to someone. I would have done differently. I wouldn’t have run away from Eastpoint.

I shoved the underwear back under his seat. How would I have brought that up? Was that a conversation I was willing to have at that time and place? It wasn’t. Before I could think of what to do, I looked up to see Howard walking back to the car. He carried two Styrofoam containers that steamed like rail locomotives on route. He opened the door and hurried inside to escape from the biting chill and turned up the heat and held his hands to the vents to warm them. He passed me my scrambled eggs where a plastic fork was stabbed upright. Howard shoveled his food into his mouth and sipped his coffee. We sat in silence only to eat and watch people go about their nocturnal doings until he wiped his hands and said “Alrighty” before he flicked his headlights on and took the park brake off. Then we were on the road again.

He checked his watch; whatever time it read raised no concern. I thought about asking him why he had my- or any girls’ underwear in his car. But I didn’t want to invite whatever might have followed, being out there on the road in the middle of nowhere, the discomfort of the question was more bearable than the discomfort of the answer.

“Who’s that in the picture?” I asked, pointing at the photograph taped on the dashboard. He lifted his thumbs from the wheel to look.

“That’s uh…That’s just the most beautiful creature to ever live.” He declared.

“Oh. That your wife?”

Howard tilted his head to the side as if my guess was somewhat correct.

“Eh, something like that…You ever watch old movies? The black and white ones?”

I shook my head.

“Okay well. She used to star in them. She was an actress.”

“Oh…cool. How did you meet?” I asked.

“Well…I always was her biggest fan. She signed a poster for me once, didn’t say anything but drew a little love heart on it too. I knew then she liked me.”

“You knew she liked you?”

“Uh huh. No doubt about it. Her last movie ever, there’s this scene where she is looking out the window, and someone opens the door. She stares straight at the camera and says ‘*I remember you. Even though years have gone by, how could I forget such love?”* Man…when I saw that I just couldn’t believe it. I knew she was talking to me.” Howard reminisced with a lover’s smile.

I didn’t really know what to say after that. Even though I was young teenager, I knew there was something not quite right about how Howard saw the world. I stared out of the window, hoping something would appear worth talking about, but the silence was too uncomfortable, it made me nervous.

“She uh…You said her last movie? She doesn’t act anymore?”

Howard nodded. “Yeah…there was a…what do you call it…an accident I’d say…You know, you *do* have her eyes. That’s good.” He said.

I forced a smile, but I didn’t mean it.

“Something wrong?” Howard asked me.

I hated that he said that. It was like he knew I didn’t believe him and wanted to know what I had to say about it.

“Um. Well. I just saw that you had girls’ underwear under your seat, just *right there*.” I admitted as I pointed to them.

Howard screwed his face up as he lifted his arms and legs to look around the bottom of his car seat. Keeping his eyes on the road, he took his hand and patted the general area until he finally felt what I was talking about. He pulled the underwear free and laid them on his lap.

“Oh!” He recoiled, before tossing them into the back seat.

“Listen, I’m borrowing this car from a friend of mine. I’m fixing it for her. She had her whole wardrobe in this thing. Thought I took all her clothes out.” Howard laughed and wiped his hands on his pants.

I chuckled. I did; I guess it made enough sense. Maybe I felt relieved, maybe I didn’t. But I just wanted to get to Lakesville.

“So you’re a mechanic?” I asked him.

“No. I work in sanitation and waste management.” He said, and that’s when I knew I had seen him before.

“Wait a minute. You’re the janitor at-

“At Eastpoint’s Group Home for Girls, yep. You know something… I picked you for a runaway the moment I saw you.” He said.

“On the highway?”

“At your school desk.” He interrupted. “Don’t worry! I ain’t gonna snitch. I helped them other two girls.”

“You helped Beth and Janey? Where did they go?” I wondered.

Howard stared at the road; he took a moment to answer.

“I can’t tell you that.”

“They were my friends.” I said to him.

“Then I’m sorry.” He replied.

Howard checked his watch again and cleared his throat but did not say anything else. A sign that said ***Gardner: 10 Miles*** appeared from the dark, and Howard checked his watch once more. We passed some roadside crosses, shrines made for the unlucky who crashed on these roads, new flowers told of still grieving families.

“It’s just that…I told them girls I wouldn’t tell no one. They wanted to disappear, had this whole thing planned.” He confessed.

“Okay…” I muttered.

Howard turned onto another road, then came to stop behind a timber truck hauling white Aspin logs. He followed that truck until he merged onto another main road. After a while another sign flew past us.

‘***Camden: 5 Miles***

***Eden Springs: 20 Miles***

***Scorville: 100 Miles***.’

When the detectives asked me how I knew he was going the wrong way, how I knew we were no longer heading to Lakesville the normal route, I told them that I remebered that sign. *That* apparently helped a lot in finding the gate. I didn’t ask Howard about it at the time and looking back, it wouldn’t have done anything anyway. There seemed to be more traffic on that road, and I began to realize the gravity of what I had done. When morning comes, all the teachers and social workers will be in a frenzy, the police will get called. I started to feel the twisting knot of guilt in my stomach.

“If Miss Fortescue finds me… I’m going to be in a lot of trouble. I’m already in a lot of trouble, aren’t I?” I spoke.

Howard stared ahead, “Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.”

Then he turned on his indicator and slowed down. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the car, maybe he realized he made a wrong turn. But he veered off the road and carefully drove in the ditch until a tiny clearing appeared in the woods, nothing more than a break in the tree line. The car bounced and shook side to side as we drove over uneven ground, and Howard pulled the wheel and turned onto on a dirt road seen only in the headlights.

“Where are you going?”  I argued as we disappeared into the woods.

He looked at the rearview mirror “My wife lives this way. Were gonna ask her about your parents, try to getchya home.”",1,1759392125.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

1nvxptu,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1nvxptu/hey_all_long_time_poster_here_whats_working_for_me/,"Hey all, long time poster here. What's working for me.","I thought that I should post about what I've found to be game changing supplements / medications, having tried dozens of things regularly available.  I've had LC for at least 3 years, caught Cov in Dec 2019.  Did have brain fog but never prevalent, it always been about the fatigue and PEM.


Whats made the MOST difference lately? 

 Seems that Cetirizine (anti allergy) has gotten me over a big bump that was stopping me declaring any kind of win.  So, existing allergies aren't adding to my problem, or maybe keeping the histamines under control has done it?  Either way, I'd put this top of the list of medications that have made the most difference.  Lotaradine didn't work.

Electrolytes with large amount of sodium.  Personally I went for Free Soul Hydrate on Amazon.  Always feel better after a sachet of that in a pint of water.

I am on LDN but only ever tend to go as high as 1.5mg.  It regulates my anxiety induced by nicotine patches and definitely aids sleep.  If you can get this, give it a try but evidence of LC is needed in the UK such as GP or hospital letter.

Nicotine patches.  Extra energy, alertness.  Take it off around 7pm.  5mg.

Not drinking tea.  No idea why but it reacts with me now and immediately hits me with fatigue.  Coffee doesn't so it isn't the caffeine.  I've not figured this one out, very strange.

That's it. 

As with everyone else, sleep is massively important, reducing stress, and not overdoing it.  That said, I've just had a four day window where I've worked out twice, and undertaken some major garden work lasting 4+ hours and I'm not wiped out.

Hope this helps someone.  Not declaring myself fixed yet but no serious PEM in over a month now when it was basically persistent before.  I wouldn't post if I didn't think this was worth it.

1nvxpsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1nvxpsb/join_me_for_a_random_day_in_the_life_of_a_scrum/,Join me for a random day in the life of a Scrum Master: Friday (first week of the Sprint),"Friday is usually the most relaxed day of the sprint, so I thought I’d share how mine goes. I’m doing this because it might help other Scrum Masters get a sense of what the job can look like (not saying it has to look exactly like this, just one random example from my experience). **Also, I’m curious to hear how your Fridays look!**

Alright, let’s dive in. I work remotely from home, which basically means my commute is from the kitchen to my desk with a mandatory coffee stop (non-negotiable). I pop open chat and say hi to my teams, and their replies always give me a little boost of energy. **We keep mornings as focus time, no meetings, no distractions. That gives us two solid hours before stand-up for deep work.**

This week I used that time to clean up the backlog and work on my Agile presentation for new joiners. I already had one, but I’ve been adding ideas to make it more interactive and engaging.

**At 11:00 I have stand-up with the first team, 11:30 with the next.** By 12:30 we take a little break to **play a game together.** Today was Scribble. I’m still not great at it, but I swear I’m getting better. Then lunch until 14:00.

**The afternoons on Fridays are meeting-free**. And here’s something I am really proud of: I coached my teams to **block their calendars for deep work**. At first, everyone was constantly being pulled into random calls and it was draining. Once we made it a habit to clearly mark when we were “heads-down” and not available, everything changed. **People stopped complaining about being interrupted, morale improved, and productivity went way up.**

Of course, people still do pair programming and collaborate a lot since we work remotely, but that’s productive teamwork, not outside noise.

I usually spend my Friday afternoons catching up on admin tasks I didn’t finish during the week. Not glamorous, but it keeps things running smoothly. Fridays have become one of my favorite days. They’re a balance of focus, connection, and wrapping things up so we go into the weekend feeling good.

**PS: Let me know if you enjoyed this. I’m thinking about turning it into a series.** 

  
How does your Friday look as a Scrum Master? I’d love to hear how you wrap up the week, celebrate small wins, or just survive the last stretch before the weekend.

Money has become such an unbelievable point of frustration. I do not make much money-about 40k a year-due to health issues. I used to have a better paying job and a good savings fund, but this has since been depleting since health issues forced me to take a lower-paying job. I do not use credit cards because I understand they are predatory.

My partner-makes 150k/year. Did not understand credit cards are predatory, has multiple 25%+ interest credit cards totaling $65,000+. Didn't tell me about this. Every single thing that I buy is a problem to him to the point where I am regularly yelled at about money. We can't afford to eat three meals a day, I personally can't afford to go buy a coffee. I'm doing okay with the nothing, but it's really sad that I am regularly yelled at for buying things I just need to exist.

I didn't sign up for 20%+ credit cards because I understand predatory lending; I didn't sign up for all of this. He pays $2,000+ a month on credit cards. I'm just so tired and frustrated and it makes staying together seem like so much work. I feel like I'm locked into a depressing life, and I chose this person but the fact they're not great with finances and lack common sense is making the day to day so hard.

1nvxpgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvxpgo/where_can_i_buy_a_portable_mug_warmer_online/,Where can I buy a portable mug warmer online right now?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my recent experience finding the perfect mug warmer since I know many of us struggle with keeping our coffee or tea at the right temperature while working.

After dealing with lukewarm coffee for months (and countless trips to the microwave), I finally decided to look for a solution. Like many of you, I spend hours at my desk, and there's nothing worse than taking a sip of cold coffee when you're in the middle of work.

I spent weeks researching different options, reading reviews, and comparing features. What I discovered was pretty interesting – not all mug warmers are created equal. Some are basically just hot plates, while others have smart temperature control and auto-shutoff features.

The breakthrough came when I found this amazing mug warmer on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It's been a total game-changer for my daily routine. The temperature control is precise, and it keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature for hours.

What really surprised me was how energy-efficient these devices are. I was worried about leaving it plugged in all day, but it uses less power than repeatedly microwaving your drink. Plus, the safety features give me peace of mind when I'm caught up in work and forget about it.

For anyone wondering about compatibility, these warmers work with most ceramic and glass mugs. Just make sure your mug has a flat bottom for optimal heat transfer. I've used mine with everything from my favorite coffee mug to tea cups.

If you're still on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But after using it for a few months now, I can't imagine going back. You can check out the one I got here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. The reviews speak for themselves, and the price point is really reasonable for what you get.

Some quick tips if you decide to get one:
- Place it on a stable, flat surface
- Keep it away from water splashes
- Clean the heating plate regularly
- Use mugs with flat bottoms for best results

I've noticed my productivity has actually improved since I'm not constantly getting up to reheat my drinks. Plus, there's something really satisfying about having perfectly heated coffee throughout the day.

Has anyone else tried using a mug warmer? I'd love to hear about your experiences or answer any questions you might have about using one!

Remember, keeping your drink at the right temperature isn't just about comfort – it's about enjoying your beverage the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Hope this helps anyone who's been looking for a solution to the eternal cold coffee problem!",1,1759391877.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer: This is my rant here in this platform. I will also submit an official complaint/concern letter to the UST ASC STRAW Committee via their grievance forms. I suggest you do the same. 

--------

There are multiple reasons as to why the STRATCOST Prelims this time is the way it is but I do not want to digress from the possible main cause of all this chaos. To the administration of AMV,  did you even CHECK the exam questionnaire? Or took a mere glance? 

If you have even skimmed the content of the paper, you could see that this CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHIN TWO HOURS. Theories alone, most took at least fourty-five minutes to answer. I think minimum pa nga ang one hour. And, the problems. For Pete's sake, did you really not take even a peek? First question had FIVE CASES. With REQUIRED RECOMPUTATIONS FOR ALL CASES that took at least half an hour.

Most questions in the theories part required in-depth analysis. And the worst part? There was even an added LETTER E in the choices for NO ANSWER GIVEN. Instead of a 25-percent chance gain two points, it decreased to 20 dahil kailangan pang mag-overthink kung nandoon ba sagot mo o wala.

The problems part even had an unnecessary quote that literally had no essence at all; sinayang niyo na oras ng mga bata, nagsayang pa kayo ng papel. And, seriously? Can't even find the time to fix the nonsensical format. Alam niyong bagong instructor ang gagawa, maski font at numbering hindi niyo man lang kami pinagbigyan sa maayos na kalidad.

We poured countless hours to study for this exam. We sacrificed countless hours of sleep, important appointments, recreation, mental health, physical health. Konti na lang pati buhay namin ialay na para sa pag-aaral. After the INTACC2 Quiz 2, we went straight to prepare for this exam. So, please understand how disheartening it was for us when we saw those questions and thought of all profanities there is because WE KNEW; We knew it would be impossible to successfully answer, accurately re-check, and carefully scrutinize all our answers because there was just NOT ENOUGH TIME to do so.

To the FACULTY OF STRATEGIC COST MANAGEMENT, same question, did you even check this? Did you even try to solve this?

You knew what you taught (if you actually taught something, lol) to your students. Tingin niyo ba sapat na lahat ng mga itinuro niyo para masagutan yung exam? Yes, there should be enough space for you to leave para kami ang umintindi at hindi iasa lahat ng comprehension sa profs.

Pero, honestly lang po, ha? Some professors DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CHECK THE CONTENTS OF THE EXAM. Iba-iba kayo ng turo, iba-iba kayo ng interpretation. Wala po ba kayong GC? How can you assure us the level of competence this college had promised us at the beginning of our journey here kung maski attendance, palyado pa iba sa inyo?

And, to you Mr. Patrick Louie Reyes. For starters, I warmly welcome you to the UST-AMV College of Accountancy! Sana maramdaman mo ang nagbabaga naming inis. 

I DON'T KNOW WHERE ALL THIS AUDACITY IS COMING FROM. This exam with this level of difficulty coming from the professor who just came out of the blue at pinaghintay ang mga estudyante niya for the whole prelims period? My heart goes out to all students of 2A6 and the other blocks na kinailangan pang mag-effort na kumuha ng sandamakmak na materials from all platforms and all people just to have an ounce of understanding to this course that supposedly, even mere three-hour sessions per week can't fully grasp. At sa Admin, bakit niyo hinayaan 'to? How do you expect Accountancy students to study for their major accounting subject without a professor? Kahit mascot man lang, wala? 

And, Sir Reyes, you didn't even bother to place numberings in your problems; that simple act of kindness to organize your questionnaire and let it be easier for us to understand, hindi mo pa pinaranas samin.

To all the course instructors for this subject, thank you for your materials, but WE NEED YOUR COMPASSION and understanding more than your intellectual magnanimity. Yung totoong compassion, please, hindi yung iaasa na lang na maaayos ang mental health ng mga bata sa pa-kumustahan over coffee.

I get it. WE GET IT. You want us to learn and honestly, we do, too. Kaya nga kami nasa AMV, hindi po ba? Kaya namin pinili 'tong college na 'to because we believed in the competence of its curriculum and the prestige it holds in the academe due to its lauded history in the field of accounting.

Pero, please. HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR US STUDENTS, TOO. Wala na kayong awa sa schedule niyo. Wala na kayong ginawang bago sa bulok na sistema niyo. Wala pa kayong pag-unawa para sa mga mag-aaral niyo.

We are your constituents, not your servants who will do anything at your bidding. Wala kaming kapote at payong para maging resilient sa may-sa-bagyo niyong pamamahala.

I wrote all of this out of respect for all the students' effort, respect for professors who actually bid their time to offer knowledge, and respect for the accounting field we've all dreamed being a member of. Huwag po sanang masamain.

Please, do better.",33,1759391816.0,amvians,1,1.0,False

# Hey reddit fam,

I'm Kunal, and I've always been fascinated by a paradox in travel. We travel to feel present, to discover, and to experience new things. Yet, so much of our precious vacation time—both before and during the trip—is spent staring at our phones, figuring out where to go next or if a place is even worth visiting.

The experience of travel itself is often fragmented by the constant mental load of planning.

I believe we can change that. I'm building **Travique** to create a more seamless, intelligent, and enriching travel experience from end to end.

Our vision is simple: **Experience more, plan less.**

**Travique** is an AI-native platform that acts as your personal travel intelligence. Instead of you doing all the work, our platform learns your unique style and builds a complete, bespoke journey from the ground up. We're focused on delivering a fundamentally better travel experience through four key pillars:

**🧠 Deep Personalization:** The AI creates a truly logical, day-by-day itinerary with an interactive map that is 100% tailored to you.

**💎 Uncovering Hidden Gems:** We have a dedicated AI that scours data to find authentic local restaurants, secret photo spots, and unique experiences that most guidebooks miss, weaving them directly into your plan.

**✨ A Seamless Experience:** The entire journey, from the initial idea to the final plan, lives in one beautiful, clean interface.

**🗣️ The Future is Conversational:** On our near-term roadmap is an integrated AI chatbot. Soon, you'll be able to modify your plan with simple commands like ""make tomorrow more relaxed"" or ""find me a good coffee shop near the museum.""

We're in the final stages of polishing the platform before our official launch, and the feedback from this community of builders and early adopters would be absolute gold. We've just opened up our waitlist for those who want to be the first to try it.

**You can check out our landing page and join the waitlist here:**

**You can also view sample travel plan generated by our platform here, to see what all it can do -**

I'm here all day to answer any questions and would be incredibly grateful for your thoughts.

My questions for you are:

1. What's your single biggest frustration with the current way you plan trips?
2. We're thinking of a ""pay-per-trip"" model (unlock a full itinerary for a one-time fee) instead of a recurring subscription. Does that resonate with you?
3. Looking at our landing page, does our value proposition come across clearly?
4. What's one ""killer feature"" you wish your dream travel planner had?

Thanks for your time and insight!

Cheers,

*Somewhere on Highway 26.*

 

“Course, I didn’t even see him come up on me, too busy trying to put my tent together, I just heard my brother shout *‘Howard! Turn around!’* and sure enough when I turned there was the biggest alligator I ever seen with my ankle between his teeth and I pulled that leg out just before he went *snap*! The teeth caught the sole of my shoe and ripped it right off my foot!” Howard laughed, wiping a tear from his eye.

I was laughing too.

“What did you do next?”

Howard looked at me and shook his head. “You wouldn’t even believe it…”

“I would!” I insisted, eager to hear how his story ended.

Howard’s eyes lifted from the road as if to look up and retrieve the memory from the stars.

“I lept over my tent, just stood there frozen staring at this monster and he is staring at me, and I tell you this alligator laughed.”

“Laughed? Alligators can’t laugh!” I refuted.

“This one did.” Howard assured me, “*Ha-Ha-Ha*, like that…. Then it just backed into the water again, disappeared completely, not a bubble. I said to my brother, “*Get me the hell out of here, that damn gator can keep the shoe!*”

A green sign materialized out from the darkness.

**Taghorn: 20 Miles**

**Garden Rock: 80 Miles**

**Lakesville: 170 Miles.**

Howard checked his watch and yawned.

“Good diner up in Taghorn, you like eggs?” He asked.

I shrugged, “Yeah I guess.”

“I could do with some coffee.”

I looked out to a passing country shrouded in darkness to reveal nothing of where we could be. A ghostly reflection of myself stared back through the window and I could see Howard staring behind me. I looked at him, and his eyes were on the road again.

“Are you from Eastpoint?” I asked him.

“Who me? Yeah, could say I am.” He answered.

“But you were going to Lakesville?”

“That’s correct. I’m in between at the moment. Got some family up there I’m gonna stay with over the weekend. It’s my brother’s birthday actually.”

“I feel like I’ve seen you before.” I said to him, something familiar about this person driving like a puzzle piece that fit somewhere in memory. Talkative Howard paused, he heard me but did not answer straight away, he glanced at the rearview mirror and cleared his throat.

“It’s possible.” He muttered. “It’s a small town.”

“I’m worried that my parents tried to pick me up, or that I was wrong about this whole thing.” I admitted.

Howard was letting another car overtake him.

“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m sure that was their initial plan, but stuff *does* happen. Hell, my folks left me in some places.” He chuckled.

In the distance I could see glowing dots appearing down the hill. A small town. Taghorn.

When we pulled into the dirt parking lot, the neon sign of the diner was like a stellar beacon on a dark planet, as if trucks bound for the Las Vegas strip had it fall from their cargo and here it stayed, repurposed. There were a few cars already parked, the car that passed us was getting gas at the station further down. In the window of the diner some lone travelers held cutlery to pancakes and from their coffee cup’s steam rose to form apparitions of ghostly company in their solitary booths. An old man sat hands clasped to his chin, pondering the limited future and thanked a waitress with a nod.

I unbuckled my seatbelt, but Howard stopped me.

“Wait in the car, little miss, I’ll bring you back some eggs.”

He opened the door and left for the diner, leaving me with the rhythmic vibrations of the idling engine. As he walked hands hidden in his jacket pockets, a couple stopped him.

They seemed to recognize him as smiles formed on their faces, and they were quick to shake hands. They stood talking. Howard pointed back at his car with me inside and the couple turned to look and waved at me. I waved back. Howard said a last goodbye to them as he opened the diner’s door. The couple got inside a truck and then their taillights passed into the night as another thing devoured.

Howard disappeared into the diner and I sat waiting. Boredom turned into curiosity, so I looked behind at the back seat. There was a canvas gym bag, a black pen, a stained baseball cap and the crumpled leftovers of a drive-thru dinner and receipts. I turned the dial of the radio and a roar of static came through, but also a man’s voice:

‘*(***Inaudible***)’s Estate has urged the thief to come forward and return the remains of (***Inaudible***) to the (***Inaudible***) Memorial Gardens in Hollywood.*’

I turned the radio off again, the signal was still awful.

I looked at the dashboard behind the steering wheel and saw a gas tank over half full and a picture of a woman, a crease ran through her face like the image was mostly kept folded. I studied the black scuff marks on the glove compartment in front of me, struck into plastic like the scratched tallies of a jailcell calendar. I looked at the footwells, and that’s when I saw a piece of pink fabric wedged beneath his seat.

Curious, I leant over and pinched the cloth between my fingers and pulled it free where it un-scrunched and fell into its shape, where to my horror, I saw it was a pair of my missing underwear.

I wanted to be wrong, that they were not mine. I had not seen that pair for over a week and hoped by some strange, concerning coincidence, I had found ones that were the exact pattern and size that I had blamed the other orphaned girls for stealing.

At that age, my gut feeling knew more than I did, and I should have listened to it. If I could go back, I would have run from that car. I would have gone to someone. I would have done differently. I wouldn’t have run away from Eastpoint.

I shoved the underwear back under his seat. How would I have brought that up? Was that a conversation I was willing to have at that time and place? It wasn’t. Before I could think of what to do, I looked up to see Howard walking back to the car. He carried two Styrofoam containers that steamed like rail locomotives on route. He opened the door and hurried inside to escape from the biting chill and turned up the heat and held his hands to the vents to warm them. He passed me my scrambled eggs where a plastic fork was stabbed upright. Howard shoveled his food into his mouth and sipped his coffee. We sat in silence only to eat and watch people go about their nocturnal doings until he wiped his hands and said “Alrighty” before he flicked his headlights on and took the park brake off. Then we were on the road again.

He checked his watch; whatever time it read raised no concern. I thought about asking him why he had my- or any girls’ underwear in his car. But I didn’t want to invite whatever might have followed, being out there on the road in the middle of nowhere, the discomfort of the question was more bearable than the discomfort of the answer.

“Who’s that in the picture?” I asked, pointing at the photograph taped on the dashboard. He lifted his thumbs from the wheel to look.

“That’s uh…That’s just the most beautiful creature to ever live.” He declared.

“Oh. That your wife?”

Howard tilted his head to the side as if my guess was somewhat correct.

“Eh, something like that…You ever watch old movies? The black and white ones?”

I shook my head.

“Okay well. She used to star in them. She was an actress.”

“Oh…cool. How did you meet?” I asked.

“Well…I always was her biggest fan. She signed a poster for me once, didn’t say anything but drew a little love heart on it too. I knew then she liked me.”

“You knew she liked you?”

“Uh huh. No doubt about it. Her last movie ever, there’s this scene where she is looking out the window, and someone opens the door. She stares straight at the camera and says ‘*I remember you. Even though years have gone by, how could I forget such love?”* Man…when I saw that I just couldn’t believe it. I knew she was talking to me.” Howard reminisced with a lover’s smile.

I didn’t really know what to say after that. Even though I was young teenager, I knew there was something not quite right about how Howard saw the world. I stared out of the window, hoping something would appear worth talking about, but the silence was too uncomfortable, it made me nervous.

“She uh…You said her last movie? She doesn’t act anymore?”

Howard nodded. “Yeah…there was a…what do you call it…an accident I’d say…You know, you *do* have her eyes. That’s good.” He said.

I forced a smile, but I didn’t mean it.

“Something wrong?” Howard asked me.

I hated that he said that. It was like he knew I didn’t believe him and wanted to know what I had to say about it.

“Um. Well. I just saw that you had girls’ underwear under your seat, just *right there*.” I admitted as I pointed to them.

Howard screwed his face up as he lifted his arms and legs to look around the bottom of his car seat. Keeping his eyes on the road, he took his hand and patted the general area until he finally felt what I was talking about. He pulled the underwear free and laid them on his lap.

“Oh!” He recoiled, before tossing them into the back seat.

“Listen, I’m borrowing this car from a friend of mine. I’m fixing it for her. She had her whole wardrobe in this thing. Thought I took all her clothes out.” Howard laughed and wiped his hands on his pants.

I chuckled. I did; I guess it made enough sense. Maybe I felt relieved, maybe I didn’t. But I just wanted to get to Lakesville.

“So you’re a mechanic?” I asked him.

“No. I work in sanitation and waste management.” He said, and that’s when I knew I had seen him before.

“Wait a minute. You’re the janitor at-

“At Eastpoint’s Group Home for Girls, yep. You know something… I picked you for a runaway the moment I saw you.” He said.

“On the highway?”

“At your school desk.” He interrupted. “Don’t worry! I ain’t gonna snitch. I helped them other two girls.”

“You helped Beth and Janey? Where did they go?” I wondered.

Howard stared at the road; he took a moment to answer.

“I can’t tell you that.”

“They were my friends.” I said to him.

“Then I’m sorry.” He replied.

Howard checked his watch again and cleared his throat but did not say anything else. A sign that said ***Gardner: 10 Miles*** appeared from the dark, and Howard checked his watch once more. We passed some roadside crosses, shrines made for the unlucky who crashed on these roads, new flowers told of still grieving families.

“It’s just that…I told them girls I wouldn’t tell no one. They wanted to disappear, had this whole thing planned.” He confessed.

“Okay…” I muttered.

Howard turned onto another road, then came to stop behind a timber truck hauling white Aspin logs. He followed that truck until he merged onto another main road. After a while another sign flew past us.

‘***Camden: 5 Miles***

***Eden Springs: 20 Miles***

***Scorville: 100 Miles***.’

When the detectives asked me how I knew he was going the wrong way, how I knew we were no longer heading to Lakesville the normal route, I told them that I remebered that sign. *That* apparently helped a lot in finding the gate. I didn’t ask Howard about it at the time and looking back, it wouldn’t have done anything anyway. There seemed to be more traffic on that road, and I began to realize the gravity of what I had done. When morning comes, all the teachers and social workers will be in a frenzy, the police will get called. I started to feel the twisting knot of guilt in my stomach.

“If Miss Fortescue finds me… I’m going to be in a lot of trouble. I’m already in a lot of trouble, aren’t I?” I spoke.

Howard stared ahead, “Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.”

Then he turned on his indicator and slowed down. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the car, maybe he realized he made a wrong turn. But he veered off the road and carefully drove in the ditch until a tiny clearing appeared in the woods, nothing more than a break in the tree line. The car bounced and shook side to side as we drove over uneven ground, and Howard pulled the wheel and turned onto on a dirt road seen only in the headlights.

“Where are you going?”  I argued as we disappeared into the woods.

He looked at the rearview mirror “My wife lives this way. Were gonna ask her about your parents, try to getchya home.”",1,1759391658.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

# Introduction

The rise of Artificial Intelligence has changed how SEO professionals, businesses, and freelancers approach digital marketing. Ten years ago, SEO was about optimizing meta tags, placing keywords, and building backlinks. Fast forward to today—AI tools like **Gemini (Google’s AI)** and **ChatGPT (OpenAI’s AI)** are reshaping the future of SEO research and content creation.

Whether you are a **freelance content writer**, an [**SEO freelancer**](https://digitalhari.in/seo-freelancer-in-india/), or a **freelance social media expert**, you’ve likely wondered:

 *Between Gemini and ChatGPT, which AI tool is better for SEO?*

This is not just a theoretical question—it has real-world consequences. For example:

* Businesses rely on freelancers to create optimized content that ranks.
* Freelancers rely on tools to deliver faster and better results to clients.
* SEO strategies depend on accurate keyword research, structured content, and engaging writing.

Over the past year, debates have taken place across [**Reddit SEO forums**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1eon28w/does_content_from_chatgpt_or_gemini_make_sense/), **Quora discussions**, and professional SEO blogs. Some argue that Gemini’s integration with Google gives it an unbeatable advantage in keyword research, while others insist that ChatGPT’s creative writing skills make it superior for content marketing.

In this blog, we will dive deep into this debate. You’ll learn:

* The strengths and weaknesses of Gemini vs ChatGPT.
* Which tool performs better in **keyword research, content writing, technical SEO, and social media**.
* Real-world insights from freelancers and SEO experts.
* How [**freelance content writers**](https://digitalhari.in/freelance-content-writer-in-india/)**, SEO freelancers, and social media experts** can use these tools in 2025.
* Why the smartest strategy is to combine both.

This will be a long-form, detailed analysis—so grab a coffee, and let’s begin.

# Why AI Tools Are Essential for SEO in 2025

Search engine optimization is no longer a one-person job with just spreadsheets and manual research. SEO has evolved into a multi-layered discipline involving:

* **Keyword research** (finding what your audience is searching for).
* **Content writing** (creating blog posts, product pages, and guides that answer those queries).
* **Technical SEO** (optimizing schema, site speed, and meta data).
* **Social media integration** (building visibility outside Google).

For a **freelance content writer or SEO freelancer**, meeting all these demands without AI is challenging. AI tools now act as **assistants, researchers, and co-writers**, helping freelancers save time and focus on creativity.

Here’s why they matter:

* **Faster research:** AI analyzes hundreds of potential keywords and SERPs instantly.
* **Smarter content:** AI helps create outlines, drafts, and optimized text at scale.
* **Competitive edge:** A freelancer who uses AI can deliver more value to clients compared to one who doesn’t.
* **Adaptability:** Social media, SEO, and content marketing are fast-changing. AI tools adapt quicker than humans can.

Now, let’s take a closer look at Gemini and ChatGPT.

# What is Gemini?

Gemini is Google’s AI model, formerly known as Bard. It is designed with one clear advantage: **real-time access to Google’s ecosystem**. Unlike some AI models that rely on older data, Gemini pulls in **current search results and live trends**.

For SEO, that’s a big deal. Imagine being able to know which keywords are trending this week, or how competitors are ranking, without manually opening Google Search or using paid keyword tools.

# Key Strengths of Gemini for SEO:

1. **Live Search Integration** – Gemini can analyze Google’s SERPs in real time.
2. **Workspace Integration** – It connects with Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail, helping freelancers collaborate with clients easily.
3. **Technical SEO Accuracy** – Generates schema, headings, and meta tags that align with Google’s ranking systems.
4. **Up-to-date Information** – Unlike static models, Gemini reflects the latest SEO trends.

For **SEO freelancers**, this is like having an insider guide to what Google prioritizes right now.

# What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is OpenAI’s most popular AI tool, widely used across industries. Unlike Gemini, ChatGPT doesn’t rely on real-time Google SERPs by default (unless connected via plugins), but it excels in **creativity, flexibility, and content depth**.

It is especially useful for **freelance content writers and social media experts**, because it can adapt to different tones, industries, and content types.

# Key Strengths of ChatGPT for SEO:

1. **Creative Content Writing** – Produces natural, engaging, and well-structured blogs and articles.
2. **Keyword Clustering** – Suggests related keywords and topic clusters for SEO content strategy.
3. **Third-party Integrations** – Works with SEO plugins and tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or SurferSEO.
4. **Marketing Versatility** – From blog posts to social media captions, [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) is highly adaptable.

For **freelancers working with multiple clients**, ChatGPT is like a co-writer who never gets tired.

# Gemini vs ChatGPT: SEO Showdown

Let’s compare them across the most important SEO tasks.

   * Good for ad copy and hashtags.
   * Limited creativity in social storytelling.
* **ChatGPT:**
   * Creates engaging captions, campaign ideas, and storytelling content.

 *Winner: ChatGPT* – Engagement matters most in social media, and ChatGPT delivers.

# 5. Overall Usability

* **Gemini:** Best for **data-driven SEO professionals**.
* **ChatGPT:** Best for **content-driven freelancers and marketers**.

 *Winner: Tie* – Depends on your role.

# Insights from SEO Communities

From **Reddit SEO forums**:

* Many freelancers admit to using AI for **outlines, tags, and drafts** but always edit manually.
* Some noted that AI-generated blogs, when edited, drove thousands of clicks.
* The biggest mistake? Posting raw AI content without review.

From [**Quora discussions**](https://www.quora.com/Between-ChatGPT-and-Gemini-which-is-best-for-doing-SEO-research):

* Gemini is praised for **real-time keyword accuracy**.
* ChatGPT is valued for **user-friendly, high-quality content**.
* Experts recommend **using both together**.

* Draft and polish with ChatGPT.
* Deliver high-quality blogs that rank.

# SEO Freelancers

* Use Gemini for schema, metadata, and competitive analysis.
* Use ChatGPT for content briefs, outreach emails, and proposals.

# Freelance Social Media Experts

* Use Gemini for trend research and hashtags.
* Use ChatGPT for captions, campaign ideas, and engagement posts.

# The Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds

The future of SEO is not choosing one over the other—it’s about **combining** [**Gemini**](https://gemini.google.com/) **and ChatGPT**.

1. **Start with Gemini** → Gather keywords, analyze SERPs, create structured SEO outlines.
2. **Move to ChatGPT** → Write engaging, long-form content, captions, and creative copy.
3. **End with Human Editing** → Fact-check, refine tone, and ensure originality.

This approach maximizes **accuracy, creativity, and trustworthiness**—the three pillars of SEO in 2025.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. Can AI replace freelance content writers or SEO freelancers?**  
No. AI is a tool, not a replacement. Businesses still need human expertise to edit, add brand voice, and apply real-world strategy.

**2. Which is better for keyword research: Gemini or ChatGPT?**  
Gemini is better for real-time keyword research since it uses Google’s live data. ChatGPT is useful for clustering ideas.

**3. Is it safe to publish AI-generated content?**  
Yes, if it’s edited. Raw AI text often lacks depth and can be flagged by Google. Human editing ensures originality and SEO compliance.

**4. Which AI tool is better for freelance social media experts?**  
ChatGPT is better for captions and engagement. Gemini helps with hashtag trends.

**5. Should businesses choose Gemini or ChatGPT?**  
Both. Gemini is excellent for research and technical SEO, while ChatGPT is unbeatable for content writing and creativity.

# Conclusion

The comparison between **Gemini and ChatGPT for SEO** reveals that both tools have their own strengths. ChatGPT excels in creativity, user engagement, and versatile content generation, while Gemini shines in accuracy, integration with Google’s ecosystem, and real-time SEO insights. For **freelance content writers, SEO freelancers, and** [**freelance social media experts**](https://digitalhari.in/freelance-social-media-expert-in-india/), the smartest strategy is not to choose one over the other, but to leverage both in ways that complement each other.

AI is powerful, but it cannot replace human strategy, creativity, and expertise. That’s where professionals like [**Hariharan Gandhi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/digital-hari/) step in. As a **freelance SEO expert, content writer, and digital strategist**, Hariharan brings the perfect balance between AI-driven efficiency and human-led storytelling. Through [**Digital Hari**](https://digitalhari.in/), he shares actionable insights, industry trends, and proven strategies to help businesses, freelancers, and marketers succeed in today’s competitive online landscape.

I moved to a new city and have been going to meetups/groups to meet people. If I click with someone I usually invite them to brunch/coffee and then go from there (these are all women btw). 

There have been a few times now where the vibes seem great and we’ll hang out one or two times, and they’ll say they’ll set something up but then never do. Normally this wouldn’t bother me because I assume they don’t want to hang out, but a couple of times, they’ll still interact with something I post on social media, or ask about recommendation or something that we spoke about when we met in person. In these cases I’ll send a friendly “let me know if you’re up to check out that [whatever place we talked about before]” but then it’ll be silence again. 

At the end of the day I’ll respect if someone doesn’t want to pursue a friendship but I’m not sure why people come back to interact further. It’s just a bit discouraging when it happens 2-3 times in a row and get excited to connect with someone who doesn’t have any interest.

I do travel a lot for work/in general (I work remotely so I do week trips here and there) and I wonder if people don’t like that inconsistency.

Perhaps I’m approaching things wrong? Just want to get some insight if anyone’s gone through this too. ",2,1759391139.0,AskWomenOver30,2,1.0,False

Hello dear community,

I (F) live in a pretty touristy European city and have been using Hangouts on and off (before COVID and now again for the past 6 months) for meeting travelers for the most part. About half the time it’s been great but I keep running into the same patterns that confuse me a bit:

- someone asks to join my HO but then never writes back. Sometimes it’s even a local person and totally radio silent , yet the next day they’re back asking to join again
- i suggest a time or place and the reply is something like “I’ll message you when I’m free”. I am flexible location-wise but time-wise I prefer clear transparent communication and “when I’m free” isn’t really an option for me cos I’m not going to sit around waiting. Usually I’ll reply that they can message me anytime, but I can’t promise I’ll be available then. I was hoping for more of a “let’s hang out now or in a couple hours” situation (and even put that in the HO description).
- sometimes I open a HO for “cycling” and it turns out the other person doesn’t even have a bike or not willing to rent out. Or I suggest grabbing a coffee and they want to go to a rave party
- and I’m not even starting on how people don’t read profiles at all. I know that’s more essential for a hosting surfing scenario, but even for HOs it matters (I’ve had situations where it turned out we were just not a good fit mostly for lifestyle or political reasons).

It’s been frustrating and I’m wondering: is this just how HOs work and I’m expecting too much ? Or is there some kind of etiquette that I’m missing ? If you do HOs, how do you handle this ?

Would love to read your feedback. Many thanks !",2,1759391124.0,couchsurfing,0,1.0,False

1nvxfvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1nvxfvt/starbucks_is_the_best_coffee/,Starbucks is the best coffee.,"Starbucks always gets shat on by ""coffee enthusiasts."" They argue that the quality is bad (not true) and it's overpriced (Maybe). But I honestly think that it is just the case of some people hating or being critical of something popular. You know how some people hate on things that are popular.

But from my experience (I'm not a coffee expert whatsoever)  is that their coffee is consistently good no matter which branch I go. The filter coffee you can buy for your house is good too and there just is a consistency to them and a distinct starbucks taste that I love.

My biggest gripe is boutique cafes having subpar quality. Maybe boutique cafes have a good quality in America but in my country it's such a gamble. Some places are really good but for the most part they just suck. 

For example a big problem in my country is iced coffee. What happens is I go to a boutique or other cafes. I get an iced amircano, and because they probably don't have the best equipment the ice gets melted really fast and my coffee is a bit colder than lukewarm at best. 

But what happens when I go to starbucks? I get great cold coffee consistently. The ice is never melted and the coffee is ice cold. In summer which gets really warm here, this is a great service for me. And I am willing to defend starbucks forever. I don't care if you are probably more expensive, I will still buy from you because I know what I'm getting. ",0,1759390839.0,unpopularopinion,9,0.44,False

*Where Tennis Meets Stand-Up Comedy*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s crunch some numbers like a tennis player crunching through a bagel between sets. Alejandro Tabilo enters this clash as the slight favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.74–1.83** (implying a **54.6%–56.8% implied probability** of victory). Marcos Giron, the 48th-ranked American, checks in at **1.74–2.15** (a **46.5%–57.1%** range), per the bookies. The spread? Tabilo’s -0.5 set favorite, which screams “this could be a nail-biter” louder than a line judge shouting “OUT!”

The total games line sits at **23.0–23.5**, suggesting a match that’s tighter than Giron’s grip on his racket during a tiebreaker. If you’re betting on “Under,” you’re banking on two aces and a yawn; “Over” fans, prepare for a popcorn-fueled rally.

**Digesting the News: Form, Surface, and Sleep Deprivation**  
Tabilo’s résumé in Asia reads like a five-star Yelp review: **13 wins, 2 losses**, including a **Chengdu title** and a **Guangzhou final**—both snatched from the qualifying rounds like a thief in the night. His lone career main-draw win over Giron came in **2022 Madrid (clay)**, but this Shanghai showdown is on **hard courts**, where Giron’s power game could theoretically shine. However, Tabilo’s recent form on Asian hard courts is the tennis equivalent of a Wi-Fi signal with five bars.

Giron, meanwhile, is the “I’ll sleep when I’m famous” poster child. The match starts at **1:30 AM Chilean time** (5:00 AM local), which means Tabilo might be playing on **Chilean coffee** and **Korean kimchi** while Giron’s circadian rhythm is still debating whether it’s morning or a dream. Giron’s also never faced a player with Tabilo’s Asian swing magic, which is like encountering a vending machine that only accepts your local currency—unpredicta

Share the Most Jaw-Dropping Free Gift You’ve Ever Received & Unlock a Secret Surprise 🎁💫,"✨ What’s the Best Gift You’ve Ever Received for Free? Share & Win a Surprise!  

Top On Massive Giveaway Alert 🚨  

Okay friends, I’ve been thinking about this ALL day… the best gifts, the ones that catch you totally off guard, are always the ones that are free. Right? Like, not bought because someone felt obligated, but GIVEN freely—sometimes from a person, sometimes from life itself.  

For me, honestly, the best free gift I ever got was a handwritten little note from someone I didn’t even expect to care. Not worth a cent, but hey… I’ve kept it for years. It’s crazy how these tiny, simple things stay bigger in the heart than anything kept in a shiny shopping bag.  

But hold on… I want to flip this question to YOU. Yes, YOU reading this!  
What free gift blew your mind or made you stop and rethink what “priceless” really means?  

Some ideas might spark your memory:  
- 🎁 A random act of kindness—someone paying for your coffee.  
- 📚 Knowledge freely shared that helped you forever.  
- 🎶 A memory, an invite, or even just time someone spent with you.  
- 🌍 Travel experience you got without paying (who else scored a trip??).  
- 💌 A physical item, maybe small, that carried way bigger meaning.  

It’s kind of funny… The gifts that feel the richest rarely come with a receipt attached. That confuses me sometimes—why do we chase so hard for “things” when often the free ones feel heavier in the best way possible? 🤯  

So here’s the deal—drop your story below about the BEST free gift you’ve received. Doesn’t matter if it’s an object, a gesture, or even a random stranger making you smile at the exact perfect moment. Share it. Inspire someone. Make us all rethink what “value” is really worth. And yes… a sweet surprise is waiting for the best, most heart-hitting responses.  

And speaking of surprises… if you love free, you’re seriously going to want to jump on this 👇

1nvx5qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1nvx5qc/genetics_nutrition_and_long_covid_my_experiment/,"Genetics, Nutrition, and Long COVID: My Experiment with DNA Data + ChatGPT","I have been battling long covid for some years now and have tried a lot of different supplements and lifestyle changes to get better, with varying results. I decided to use my genotyping DNA data to check if there is anything else I can do. I ran the data from GeneticGenie through ChatGPT GPT-5 model with the prompt shown at the bottom of this post.

TL;DR: I got many interesting insights, confirmations, and some actionable steps.
Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences, possible improvements to my prompt, and any other recommendations.

My assessment from the output

* Lifestyle and diet pointers were spot on. I would say this is 100% correct in my case. For example, I do feel great when eating fatty fish, eggs, anti-inflammatory diets, keto, carnivore. There may be some exceptions, but in general I feel bad after eating carbs. In the evening I cannot eat carbs or my sleep gets wrecked. A light meal with protein and fats in the evening is perfect for me—now confirmed by my own experimentation and gene analysis.
* Targeted supplements: I have tried many supplements and even been to specialists to get help. For B-complex I have used precursors for 1 1/2 years and I do not think I notice any difference. No one told me that I should use active forms of B-complex instead of precursors, so I will test this.
* Other: I have always been very sensitive to tobacco smoke and caffeine. A cup of coffee makes me feel very wired—much more than anyone else I know. Now this makes more sense, as this is apparently due to my genes.



The output from ChatGPT is given in the two tables below.

# Situation
I am in a situation where I have ME/CFS after a COVID-infection. This has led to fatigue, pem, intolerance to exercise, body temperature issues, insomnia or general sleep issues, flucating HRV, digestive issues and more. I have already performed some testing and found out I have gut dysbiosis. I have performed genotyping and would like to investigate how I can improve my situation.

Over time I have made some observations about my sitaution and lifestyle factors given below.

- I generally had  lot of gas in my stomach in the past. I almost always get gas in my stomach right after eating food at McDonald’s. It also happens with certain pizzas, typically chain-restaurant pizza.
- I feel better when I fast.
- I’ve often had very dry skin and small cracks just under my nails.
- I don’t gain weight – same with my mother.
- I get tired eyes / feel unwell from wine and beer. With wine it almost always happens, and with beer it happens quite often. I do not seem to be affected by this if I travel to other countries such as Greece. 
- I have grass pollen allergy.
- Thinking back, I felt amazing during the period when I ate salad for lunch before I got sick. 
- I’m quite sensitive to caffeine. After more than two cups, coffee has the opposite effect.
- After cutting gluten, my body recovers faster and feels generally better.
- Coffee make me feel extremly wired and ""turned on"".
- When I eat salmon I feel great.
- I seem to respond very good to keto/carnivore diet and do not seem to respond great when I eat a lot carbohydrates.
- Eating carbohydrates in the evening wreks my sleep while eating proteins do not affect my sleep or improves it.
- I have had issues with histamin but this has improved over time. I do not think I have histamin issues now.

# Task

Help me investigate the specific genes given or reports provided according to my sitaution and science.

# Action

Respond as if you were an medical doctor with deep expertise in nutrition and gentics. All assessments and answers must be quality checked multiple times and all answers shall be clear and consise.

# Results
Create one output per report.

The output should be a table listing the genes, number of alletes, a brief description of the gene, a list of common symptoms, supplemens and lifestyle changes to counter the negative effects from the gene.

1nvx4me,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1nvx4me/ex_cheated_on_his_new_girlfriend_with_me_should_i/,"Ex cheated on his new girlfriend with me, should I tell her?","Last year my ex (42M) and I (40F) broke up in an amicable way after 6 years together.....or so I thought. In the following 5 months we were still seeing each other on and off while we were getting things sorted and separated.
Being an amicable separation the agreement was that we would stop seeing each other when he started looking for a new partner.
I myself choose to stay single and do therapy to heal; I also didn't want to interfere in case his new partner was against us staying in contact.

7 months after separation, we were having a coffee at a local cafe, and I discovered he was seeing someone (nude pic showed up on his phone....I nearly spit my coffee! 😂). Honestly I was happy for him, though he looked like a deer in the headlights. A few weeks later our old neighbour invited me for coffee and that's when I discovered that the ex and new partner had started seeing each others days after our break up (when we were still 'very amicable'). Pretty much he was cheating on his new GF with me for months, we even went on holiday together; mind you I knew nothing about her despite asking him every time we saw each other.
 I got immediately checked for all possible STD under the sun, and when everything came back negative I told him I wanted to go no contacts and wished him all the best. I also later discovered he was cheating during our relationship as well. Lastly, a few weeks ago he reached out to try and reconnect, but I told him to leave me alone and blessed his heart 😉.

I know I would have liked to know he was a cheater,  but shall I tell the poor lady, that has been with the cheater for almost a year now, what she's looking at? 
I also would like to apologise to her, even though I didn't know of her existence for months.",3,1759389665.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

1nvx35v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/1nvx35v/maui_trip/,Maui trip,"I am 18m and have a twin sister, every my mom and dad bring us to Maui during Christmas break. The issue is I don’t get along well with my sister or mom very well. We go for around 12 days which is a long time. I understand it is very expensive to do this and I am very privileged to be dragged there every year. Where I have an issue is that I don’t have anything to do for 12 days. Day one we land shop at Costco and fill our condo with food and groceries and get settled in. It’s small but it’s enough space, 1 bedroom in the back for my parents, separate bathroom, tiny kitchen and family room which thankfully has 2 twin beds. Before they used to get one that only had 1 queen and my sister would scream bloody murder if I accidentally bumped into her at all which happens bc she lays down like a star fix and spreads all the the way out. normally resulted in me sleeping on a lounge chair on the patio, or just on the floor. Like the kid in The White Lotus the TV show. Anyways I also have an auto immune disease AS, basically I have old grandpa joints and pains and on tons of meds for it. Also get tons of inflammation and body just stays extremely sore from activity and doesn’t recover and quickly turns into over use injures and muscle strains. My parents get pissed bc I sit around on the couch the whole time and say why don’t you go onto the beach or go do something??? Ok let me go move 30 feet on to the beach and bake in the sun for a few hours and listen to screaming little kids and then once I have throughly sunburnt and bored I will come back. I also lifeguard so my job at home is already sitting and staring at water. I can do some physical activity but if I do more then a 20min hike or more I will end up in pain the fallowing days bc of auto immune disease and same thing if I decide to go swim. I also have a really hard time regulating my activity bc I love being active, I played water polo, did cross fit, and swim team before. So once I start going it’s hard to stop and end up paying for it in the days fallowing. Or just sit on the couch for 12 days straight basically. We don’t go out to dinner or lunch ever and randomly get dragged through a shopping center with my mom for 5hrs but not get to buy anything. My parents say I need to work on being more patient. But I think 12 days of boredom is a little excessive. The first 2 or 3 days it’s nice but after that I am ready to go back to California. I just don’t get the appeal of sitting on a beach and not doing anything for 12 days straight and for me I am not allowed to drive the rental car and there is only one small coffee shop and breakfast place I can walk to which takes around 30-40min to walk there and back. Everything is extremely overpriced so even if I wanted to I could pay for my own activities or anything. I also don’t get along with my sister well and my parents always want to stay up and watch stuff on the TV in the family room on the couch which is my pull out bed, so I have to stay up until 12pm sometimes while they watch true crime and other stuff I don’t care about and then get mad I go watch stuff on my phone. Which they like to take away and then I just have to sit and meditate on the couch. Idk if I am being dramatic but I just can’t enjoy it and feel like my Christmas breaks are being taken away by my parents. No I don’t have the option of staying home bc my parents don’t trust me to be home alone for that long for some reason, but they are fine leaving me for 8 days while they go on a cruise to Mexico and leave the day of my birthday. Which I am fine with it’s just that it feels like they are just choosing what rules they want at what time. Also before anyone says well your a grown adult move out. No I can’t bc I am still living at home and going to college and have a lot of medical stuff going on top of that which my parents help me pay for and manage.

I’m a teacher and on holidays at the moment, so I was in the city today running errands. After that, I decided to walk around Barangaroo and was honestly shocked at how long the lines were outside the cafes. Some of them stretched so far, like almost a kilometre! It was pretty wild. Also, everyone looked so sharp in their business clothes.

So, , I’m wondering, what’s it actually like working in the city? It must be nice to be able to take breaks and go for walks around places like Circular Quay. I also noticed a lot of people eating lunch—some brought food from home, others were buying it. Does it get super expensive eating out every day? And how much do you end up spending on lunch per week? What about business attire—how much do you typically spend on that stuff? Just curious about the whole work-life vibe in the CBD!

Holy water, silver bullets, all that crap. That’s not me. I’m not out here to kill anything. I’m out here to find her. Because… well, she has something that belongs to me. My dad. At least I think she does. I’m getting the bulk of my information from my mum, and my mum, she isn’t what people would call a reliable source. She lives in Beacon Point Sanatorium on the edge of Corvus Vale. She says a demon took my dad. But Everyone else says she killed him. That’s why she’s there, that’s why I was taken from her care when I was just a week old, and that’s why I’ve never met my big brother. I could be out there looking for him, trying to find the family I never had. But instead, I’m hunting a demon, because, unlike everyone else, I believe my mum. She told the police a demon took him after a ritual went wrong. Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, I can understand why they think she’s crazy. she told the police this information while standing next to his cold, dead body. I guess you can’t accuse something of taking someone when they are clearly visible on your living-room floor, I get that. But she insisted that this demon took his soul and left his body. That was the moment they stopped calling her an outright killer and started calling the shrink. I’m documenting this here because I need someone to know what I’m doing, even if its just strangers on the internet. I grew up being past from pillar to post in a shitty foster care system, I have no one of real value in my life. If this all goes to shit, I need someone to know…I tried. So, anyway, ill start at the beginning, I guess.  
My name is Alex, Alex Hammond, I was born in Vale central infirmary in 1989. My parents are-…were. Shannon and Jerry Hammond. I don’t know anything about my brother. He was 2 when we were separated.  
I found my Mum recently, after years of not looking.  That sounds bad, I know. But if you’re told the same story enough times, it starts to stick. You stop asking questions. For 36 years my mum was a compulsive lying psychotic murderer and that’s all there was to it. School was a cruel place. My life was common knowledge. When I started my new job as a tree surgeon up by hollowthorn forest, it didn’t take long to realise people still knew more about me than I did. “You ever spoke to her then?” Gary, my team leader asked out of the blue one day whilst casually munching on a tuna sandwich. “Spoke to who?” “Your mum mate.” “No, I don’t have a reason to, wouldn’t know where to find her even if I did.” I said, internally rolling my eyes. This line of questioning was something I was accustomed to, but I was hoping I could at least escape it at work. Gary wiped the crumbs that had accumulated in his stubble way with his sleeve, looking at me wide eyed. “Mate... she’s in there” he pointed a meaty finger upward, towards an ancient manor house style building sitting alone nestled amongst the very trees we were working on.



Beacon point isn’t far from my house. Corvus vale isn’t a big town. It’s About a 30-minute walk as the crow flies or a 10-minute drive. It sits just inside hollowstone forest, surrounded by a large stone wall. It’s peaks and chimneys visible from the road. It’s a secure site, The west wing, housed the criminals deemed too mentally unstable for general population, the rest of the building was used as a long-term residential facility for people with severe mental illnesses. White stone signs with polite fonts and little bird logos dotted the long driveway directing visitors. I was going to the west wing. Inside everything smelled like bleach and stale coffee. I didn’t tell anyone I was going. Who would I tell. I signed the visitor sheet with a pen that didn’t work until it did. The receptionist barely glanced in my direction. “Who are you here to see?” “Shannon Hammond.” She Paused and looked up. “I’m sorry Hammond is on family only visitation, and she doesn’t have any family” “I’m her son.” That got me a look. Not a kind one. More like really? I fished out my wallet and slid my ID across the desk. She didn’t pick it up. Her eyes ping ponged from the card to my face and back too many times before she sighed and printed me a badge. After an agonising wait, she buzzed me through. “Follow the lines” she said matter-of-factly. “Yellow to the visiting suit, red to the reading room, green to the lunch hall, ignore the black” “Ignore the black?” I echoed “yeah...” My trainers squeaked on the over polished floor as I followed a yellow line painted beneath them. I counted doors to stop my hands from shaking; I was so nervous. I felt as though I had shifted back in time, to the fourteen-year-old me, clutching a bin liner full of clothes outside yet another stranger’s door with a social worker telling me to be brave.

Mum sat facing away from me, at a table with edges rounded down to nothing. she staired vacantly out of the window as I sat opposite her. Her hands folded like she was waiting for church. She looked older than the picture I had. Of course she did. She had to be in at least her early sixties now. Her hair was completely grey; she’d tried to brush it neat. Her eyes met mine slowly. “Hello,” she said, softly. “Hi.” Silence fell into the space between us and had to be pushed aside. “I brought you something.” I didn’t know why I said that. I hadn’t. But I wanted to. Fruit. A magazine. A miracle. She smiled anyway. “You brought me you.” “I’m Alex,” I said, which was stupid. She knew that. But I needed to say it out loud. I needed it to be true in the air, not just in a file. “I know,” she said. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t cry. She had the tired control of someone who has learned what crying costs in places like this. For a minute we talked about nothing. The Weather. My job. My favourite food. Then it all wanted to pour out. The questions. But I didn’t know how to open that door without everything falling through the floor. She did it for me. “You look like your father” she said, quietly. A tinge of fear shot up my spine. For a moment I had visions of her lunging at me from across the table. I stayed quiet and forced a thin smile. “Do you see him?” she asked. “Who?” “your father.” I stared at her, confused. I started to think id made a huge mistake in coming here. She was clearly deranged. She saw the puzzled look on my face and started to elaborate. She smiled, “Do you see a bird? Strange looking fellow. You wouldn’t miss it if you saw.”

  
My mouth went dry. “Sometimes,” I said. “There’s a weird one that sits on my window. It’s probably got a nest” “What makes him weird?”. “He a crow but he’s white” I said flatly. She nodded like we were finally talking about something that mattered. “That’s your dad,” she said. Certain. I laughed. A small, ugly sound. “spiritually speaking” I said not knowing if it was a question or a statement. “No, literally speaking” I raised an eyebrow. This was as good of an opening as I was going to get. “How?” I hated how much I needed that word. She turned her hands palm up on the table, like showing me she had nothing hidden. “I’ve waited thirty-six years for a chance to tell you the truth Alex. Let me start from the beginning” She sat back in her chair, the hard, cheap plastic clicking under the strain.

  
“We wanted a child,” she said. “But the doctors said no. There was an incident when your father was young, he needed emergency surgery to repair an abdominal hernia but there was an accident, both vas deferens were severely damaged during the surgery leaving them scared beyond repair. No one knew. Not until it was too late.” “I don’t know what those words mean” I replied honestly. “His balls didn’t work” “oh...” I looked away embarrassed. She half smirked before continuing. “Your father wanted a child of his own so badly, he searched high and low for an answer” “I thought I had a brother.” I interrupted “Didn’t he already have a child of his own?” “This was before your brother” she stated before continuing. “He found a book, in a dusty old shop in town. Started studying the occult” “What?” “Yes, that was exactly my reaction when he told me too.” She agreed. “But it worked” “What worked?” I asked cautiously. “The summoning spell” she whispered. I’d heard enough I couldn’t believe I just sat though that. She was clearly deranged. I started to stand; she reached for my wrist stopping me dead. An icy chill running up my spine. “Please Alex, just hear me.” Her eyes were pleading. “If at the end you never want to return, I will understand but please, let me finish.” I sat down slowly. If only to get her to release me. She stroked my wrist once with her thumb before removing her hands and straightening her faded pink scrubs. “I didn’t take part in the ritual, he did that on his own, but I know it worked. I got pregnant.” “With my brother?” “yes” she smiled.

  
“It wasn’t until I read the book later that I discovered there was a price to pay. The price differs with every request, depending on what you need granted.” “What was your price” I asked leaning forward slightly. “Any subsequent children must be given to her” “What?!” I stammered “I’m a subsequent child... I..I... mean I’m a subsequent child!” “I know,” she murmured, her gaze dropping to the floor in shame. “It was never meant to be this way. After your father told me what the price would be, we promised each other that we wouldn’t have another child. We tried, truly we did.” She looked up at me, her eyes full of desperation, silently begging me to believe her sincerity. “You’d think it would be simple, not getting pregnant, but…” her voice faltered, “…she always finds a way.” “What way?” I asked “It doesn’t matter now, what matters is you were born, and we loved you. Your father loved you.” “What happened to my dad Shannon?” I couldn’t bring myself to call her mum. At this point I was still quite sure Beacon Point Sanatorium was the best place for her.

 I could see this caused her pain, but I was done listening to stories. She continued regardless “She made a mistake. The deal your dad made was between him and her. For the ritual to work in her favour we both had to be present at the summoning so that I could agree to the terms. But I wasn’t.” “Then what happened” I muttered half-heartedly. “The fortune teller that give your father the book helped us. She knew a spell; she helped us rewrite the terms. Sort of like a cosmic solicitor” she chuckled dryly. “This isn’t funny” I shot back “you killed my dad! I’ve grown up alone Shannon!” She slammed her palm on the table shocking my tears away. “It’s because of that man you got to grow up at all!” she growled. “He sacrificed his life for you! He took your place!” “Yeah. And what...? now he’s a fucking bird!?” She settled back into her seat. Resigned “she gave me a solid story. But I chose the truth.” “What!?” I stammered, exasperated. “Find Morrigan.” She whispered, defeated. “She will give you what you’re looking for” Her shoulders sagged as if the weight of the years finally pressed her down, the fight gone from her eyes. I stared at her, the words settling uneasily between us, thickening the air with a grief that tasted almost metallic. I wanted to scream, to demand sense from her rambling, but something in her expression, some fractured hope, kept me silent. Shannon no longer looked like stranger spinning tales; she looked like someone who had lost everything and was begging for a chance to make things right. The clock in the hallway ticked on, indifferent to the ruins she’d laid before me, and I realised that whether I wanted it or not, the story wasn’t finished.

We met during my final year of medical school, and we clicked instantly. Back then, we saw each other almost every day. We would grab coffee at Starbucks, have lunch together, and over time started doing more special things like going to concerts or musicals (we both love theater).

Now that we’ve graduated, we don’t see each other daily anymore, but whenever we do, it feels like no time has passed and we catch up easily. She often tells me she values me and our friendship, and I’ve honestly given a lot of weight to this bond — at one point, I even considered her my best friend.

But sometimes I get the impression that maybe I’m “just another friend” to her. I’m not really into Instagram (I post maybe once or twice a year), but she is. She constantly posts stories with friends — photos, outings, events. The thing is: whenever we hang out, she takes photos with me, but she never posts them. She’ll happily post pictures with other mutual friends, but never with me. On my side, I sometimes post a photo with her when we meet, but again, she never shares them.

Like I said, I don’t really care much about social media, so it’s not the lack of posting itself that bothers me — it’s the contrast. Why post with everyone else but never with me?

Another thing: a while ago, I told her I was taking a very important professional exam, even shared the exact date with her. I took the test, weeks have gone by, and she never asked how it went. I could bring it up myself, but honestly, it feels like she doesn’t really care. I don’t expect her to keep track of my life 24/7, but I thought close friends usually check in about important milestones. That’s what I would do for her.

I’ve heard people say that friendships are often circumstantial, that as we move from school to work and different phases of life, our circles naturally shift. So I’m wondering: am I overthinking all of this? Should I just not give importance to these details, or are these signs that the friendship isn’t what I thought it was? Should I start letting go instead of holding on so tightly?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Just wanted to share my experience because I feel like others here, especially those living in the province, might relate.

I’ve been a YSL Black Opium user for quite some time and I honestly love it. It’s sweet, fruity, floral with coffee notes—very unique and intoxicating. I get so many compliments when I wear it, and people often ask me what perfume I’m using. It’s the kind of scent that feels unforgettable.

But because there’s so much hype around YSL Libre, I got curious. Everyone described it as classy, elegant, sophisticated, very “social.” Since I live in the province and don’t have access to testers or perfume counters, I went ahead and made a blind buy.

And honestly… I was so disappointed. 😞 Yes, Libre does smell “expensive” and gives off that sophisticated vibe, but to my nose it just feels generic. It’s basically a typical vanilla-heavy perfume that I’ve smelled in many others before. It doesn’t have that nuance, depth, or intrigue that I get from Black Opium, which really stands out and leaves an impression.

It was painful too because it’s not cheap, and it turned out not to fit my taste at all. Lesson learned: hype doesn’t always mean it’s right for you.

I always wanted to smell myself so wearing a scent I like is always a mood lifter. I am tempted to buy again the Black Opium because it feels like I am not impressed by the Libre (though it smells okay). Should I just wait it out?

It's that feeling you get when you see a picture that just stops you. Like a photo of someone on a rainy day, wrapped in a blanket and holding a warm cup of coffee. You're not there, but you can almost feel the comfort, right?

There's a simple reason for that. It’s like our brain is “test-driving” the experience we're seeing. It's called the Mirror Neuron Effect. 

As a designer, our job isn't just to make things look good. It's to figure out how to share a human feeling. So instead of just showing a product, we need to focus on showing the experience. 

This is why most of the good shoe advertising don't just show the shoe, they show the runner's feeling of victory at the finish line.

It all comes down to asking one simple question before you finish any design: “What will my audience feel when they see this?”

I left it alone… but the thing is, I genuinely liked our dynamic. And now months later, I’ve circled back to the thought: what if that was just bad timing? He’s in med school final year, I’m in law school first year so I was stressed af at the beginning - both busy, probably nervous.

He’s not on the apps anymore. I haven’t reached out. But I could message him on Facebook (we quit a few mutuals), and just say something direct but low-pressure, like:

“Hey, I know we spoke earlier this year and it kinda fizzled. Totally random, but I feel like we got our wires crossed - if you’re ever still curious about that coffee, I’d be down now.”

This guy proceeds to tell me that that is how a latte is, that it's just milk and there is no coffee in it. I was very confused because I have ordered this same drink from different locations and it has never been like this and I told this guy that but he insisted he was right. I didn't want to cause any drama so I just took the drink and left. A few minutes later I got the same order from another location and this time it DID have coffee in it.

I lose the ability to write, and if I'm holding something I have to set it down, or I'll drop it. My hands just generally feel heavy and useless. My family has always indicated that they think it's normal, and I've spent most of my life thinking it is, but I actually don't think any of them experience it to the extent that I do. As far as I'm aware, it matches partial cataplexy perfectly -- particularly the fact that it's triggered by the strong emotion of finding something funny, rather than the act of laughing itself -- but I highly doubt that I have narcolepsy. If I do, I'm probably the world's luckiest narcoleptic. 

I have no daytime sleepiness, at all. I never nap. I have never fallen asleep involuntarily; not even in class, lying in bed watching something, etc. I have no trouble sleeping or waking up, and no vivid dreams, hallucinations, etc. I can't say I always feel the most energetic, but I have (cardiologist-diagnosed) POTS and associated migraines, and am under investigation for endometriosis. I do take stimulants for ADHD, but I don't need them to stay alert; I don't drink coffee or consume caffeine in any way, and on the days I don't take my stimulants, I don't get any more fatigued.

1nvwilk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvwilk,The Day I Stopped Loving Him,"Mocking laughter rang in Josephine's ears. She froze, her face pale. The half-knitted scarf slipped from her hands as she stood and rushed out.
She stumbled her way toward Nathaniel's office, demanding answers.
But just as she reached the door, she heard mocking voices from inside.
""Nathaniel, you really didn't show any mercy to Josephine, did you? You made her face so clear on purpose so she couldn't even explain herself.""
Josephine was stunned, coldness spreading through her body.
""She deserved it. She messed with Dorothy, the woman Nathaniel loves the most.""
""I just feel bad for Nathaniel. He's been through so much—hiring people to spread rumors that Josephine's mom was a mistress, dealing with those who bullied her to gain her trust, and even putting on an act of affection toward her.""
""Oh, right, Nathaniel, when do you plan to tell her the truth? If she finds out the man she's been in love with all this time is actually her future brother-in-law, she'll probably cry her heart out. The thought alone is hilarious.""
Lounging on the sofa, Nathaniel slowly tapped his cigarette against the ashtray's edge, his face an impassive mask.
As he remained silent, one of his buddies asked, ""Feeling pity for Josephine? She's the reason Dorothy has been suffering for two long years, exiled so far from home. You can't just let her off the hook!""
Hearing the name ""Dorothy,"" Nathaniel finally reacted.
He ground out his cigarette and said flatly, ""I'll tell Josephine the truth the day Dorothy returns.
""That day happens to be the anniversary she has been waiting for. I'll give her a 'surprise' and make her pay back everything she owes Dorothy.""
Josephine's breathing hitched, and her eyes fell on Nathaniel's stern face through the smoke. She felt as if a big hole had been opened in her heart, and the pain made her vision go black.
So the rumors about her mother had all been spread by Nathaniel!
He had pursued and protected her just for revenge.
The one he truly loved was her half-sister, Dorothy Reynolds.
Josephine couldn't take it anymore. She turned and ran away in panic.
But before she got far, a few girls blocked her path.
""Well, well, if it isn't the star of that exciting video!""
""You just came out of Mr. Gordon's office. Did you go offer yourself up again?""
Face pale, Josephine tried to escape but was shoved back and forth by the group.
Just then, Nathaniel's cold voice came from behind them.
""Bully her right in front of me? Do you have a death wish?""
He had walked out of his office unnoticed and was walking toward them.
The girls instantly fled.
Nathaniel came up to Josephine and fixed her messy hair. When he bent down to meet her eyes, his fingertip brushed gently across her cheek.
""I told you, if anyone bothers you again, you tell them you belong to me.""
The familiar scent of cigarettes filled Josephine's nose, making her eyes sting.
As the countless memories of his protection replayed in her mind, a hazy, dreamlike feeling washed over her.
After her mother's suicide, her father, Edward Reynolds, got back together with his first love, leaving Josephine to live a life far worse than an orphan's.
Soon, a rumor swept through the school: Josephine's mother was a mistress, and Dorothy was the rightful heir of the Reynolds family.
As ""the mistress's daughter,"" Josephine naturally became a target for bullying.
It was Nathaniel who came to her rescue. Using his authority as a board director, he shielded her effortlessly, providing a warmth she desperately needed.
Yesterday was Nathaniel's birthday. The two of them, drunk, crossed the line. He, usually so gentle and dignified, pressed her against the floor-to-ceiling window, admiring her trembling body.
The moment he slid in, a deep sense of solace settled over Josephine, like a lost bird finding its way home at last.
Little did she know, this had been nothing but a trap.
Josephine felt her mind spin.
When she came to her senses, she found herself settled into the passenger seat of Nathaniel's car.
Chapter 2
Nathaniel leaned in as he always did to buckle her seat belt. Seeing her eyes red, he spoke softly, ""The video was an accident. I'll find someone to deal with it. You're not in good shape today. I'll take you home to rest first.""
Josephine pressed her lips together. Thinking of what he had said in the office, her tears flowed uncontrollably.
Nathaniel froze for a moment, then reached up to wipe her tears. As if remembering something, he opened the car door. ""Wait for me a bit, I'll go buy something.""
When the door closed, Josephine realized Nathaniel had taken the wrong phone.
His phone was sitting in the slot by the armrest. Without knowing why, Josephine picked it up and entered Dorothy's birthday.
The phone unlocked. At the top of his chat list on WhatsApp, she saw Dorothy's name.
In their most recent chat, Dorothy asked him to cut ties with Josephine before she came back.
Nathaniel replied, ""Just a plaything. I was never with her.""
Josephine's heart sank suddenly. Fighting the sting in her nose, she kept scrolling.
In the two years Dorothy was overseas, Nathaniel called her every night at eight o'clock.
That was the time he had said he had board meetings, when Josephine must not disturb him.
On top of that, he transferred Dorothy tens of thousands every month—so fast he didn't even leave a note.
Dorothy was good at acting cute, often sending selfies to ask for praise. Nathaniel replied with pet emojis Josephine had never seen, telling her not to wear too little and to stay warm.
Looking at these chats, Josephine finally realized she had never really understood Nathaniel.
The gentle care he showed her was only a tiny piece of the love he had for Dorothy.
When Nathaniel came back to the car, there was now a box of morning-after pills in Josephine's hand.
Nathaniel gently patted her head, his voice soft as ever. ""Last night was too rushed; I didn't prepare. Take this, just in case.""
Josephine's fingers dug into the box, her lips bitten so hard they nearly bled.
If she hadn't overheard him earlier, she might still believe he was truly thinking of her.
But now, she was wide awake.
When the car stopped in front of the villa, Nathaniel leaned in as usual to kiss her goodbye. But Josephine turned away, fumbling to unbuckle her seatbelt.
His eyes darkened. He pulled her into his arms.
""Still upset because of the video?""
""...""
""The video wasn't recorded by me. The hotel manager has already been fired."" Nathaniel tilted her chin up. ""Josephine, I never wanted to hurt you, and I never will. Our anniversary is coming up soon. I'll make it up to you then.""
A white lie disguised as kindness is often more hurtful than the truth.
Josephine's nose stung. She pushed him away. ""I'll go inside first.""
She almost ran into the villa.
But the moment she stepped in, she bumped into Edward.
His face was dark. Before she could speak, he raised his hand and slapped her hard.
""Josephine, I really underestimated you. Date if you want, but to record that kind of shameless video? You've ruined my reputation!
""No wonder those people at your school targeted you. You're so filthy you attract flies!""
After shouting, Edward threw a plane ticket at her.
""I booked you a flight in seven days. Go as far away as you can and never come back!""
Josephine picked up the ticket from the floor, her fingers trembling, as if it were a sentence declaring the world had abandoned her.
Edward thought she was disgraceful and wanted her gone.
Fine. She didn't want to stay anyway.
""I'll leave,"" Josephine said flatly. ""I will listen to you and never come back.""
Edward froze, thinking he had misheard.
Back then, when he arranged for Dorothy to study abroad, he had urged Josephine to go too. But she refused, and after pressing her, he found out she was deeply in love.
He thought she would refuse again.
He never expected her to agree so quickly this time.
Only then did he ease a little, his voice cold.
""Dorothy is coming back this weekend. I'm hosting a party for her. You'll attend too.
""The video has already spread. If you don't show up, it'll only make the rumors worse.""
Josephine nodded. ""Got it.""
***
Josephine asked the school for three days off.
In those three days, she packed up everything Nathaniel had given her and listed them online at the original price.
Three days later, Dorothy returned.
Edward held a party for her at the biggest hotel in New York, inviting all the big names in business.
Nathaniel was among them.
Josephine hadn't expected to see him there. She turned to leave, but Nathaniel grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a quiet corner.
He pinned her to the wall, hands braced firmly on her sides, his hot breath brushing her ear.
""You skipped school these past days, didn't answer my messages, and even ignored our anniversary.
""Josephine, do you know how worried I was about you?""
Chapter 3
His eyes locked on her, clearly unhappy with her loss of contact.
Josephine pressed her lips and forced herself to meet Nathaniel's gaze. ""So you're worried about a meaningless sex partner?""
Usually obedient and compliant, Josephine suddenly got angry, which surprised Nathaniel.
A flash of defiance rose in him. He yanked Josephine close and wrapped his arm tight around her waist.
""Sex partner?
""It only happened once in two years. You call yourself a sex partner?""
Josephine didn't know why Nathaniel suddenly went mad, and he grabbed her chin to kiss her.
Just then, a voice came from nearby.
""Nathaniel, so you're here. Dorothy's been looking for you.""
Nathaniel frowned slightly, released Josephine, and said to that person, ""Got it. I'll be right there.""
Josephine acted surprised and asked Nathaniel, ""You know my sister?""
""More than just know her. Their relationship is more intense than you think,"" Nathaniel's friend said mockingly, ""Josephine, you're in for a big surprise.""
After they walked away, a hint of scorn flashed in Josephine's eyes.
They thought she was still in the dark and wanted to put on a show to shame her.
But they didn't know she had already sorted out her feelings and planned to cut Nathaniel off for good.
During the party, the lights suddenly went out.
In an instant, a spotlight hit the stage, and Nathaniel, wearing a suit, and Dorothy, wearing a white dress, appeared in front of everyone.
Edward smiled and raised his hand for silence, then announced loudly.
""I invited everyone here today to welcome Dorothy home after completing her studies abroad, and to share some good news.
""The Reynolds and Gordon families have been close for years. They arranged an engagement between Dorothy and young Mr. Gordon long ago.
""Now the two are in love. The engagement party will be held at the end of the month. Please come witness their happiness!""
When Edward finished, Nathaniel's friends looked at Josephine, waiting to see her break down.
But Josephine simply stood quietly among the crowd, her expression calm, as if everything on stage had nothing to do with her.
Nathaniel frowned.
In his plan, Josephine would lose control when she learned about him and Dorothy.
But she was unnaturally calm now.
A restless feeling rose in him for no clear reason. Dorothy noticed his oddness and quickly asked, ""Nathan, what's wrong?""
Nathaniel casually withdrew his gaze. ""Nothing. I just got distracted.""
He knew well that Josephine loved him deeply and couldn't possibly have no reaction.
She was only forcing herself to stay strong.
***
Josephine went to the restroom and splashed her face with cold water.
Thinking back on her old longing for Nathaniel, she felt utterly foolish.
No wonder he had touched her only once in two years.
It wasn't because he treasured her. He simply couldn't be bothered to touch her.
And the first night she had cherished was just perfect material for him to ruin her reputation.
When Josephine returned to the banquet hall, Edward called her over.
""Josephine, come say hello to your future brother-in-law.""
Josephine walked up to Nathaniel and put on a perfectly measured smile. ""Hello, Mr. Gordon.""
At the word ""Mr. Gordon,"" Nathaniel's face tightened.
Dorothy didn't notice and smiled brightly. ""Josie, I just heard Nathaniel is a board director at your school. What a coincidence. If you ever have trouble, you can ask your brother-in-law for help. We're family after all.""
Josephine clenched her teeth and said slowly, ""I won't want to trouble my brother-in-law.""
She didn't look at Nathaniel, but she could feel his cold gaze, and it made her shiver.
After some small talk, Josephine prepared to leave.
Dorothy stepped forward, looped her arm through hers, and pretended to be affectionate. ""Josie, it's been so long. I have so much to tell you.""
She dragged Josephine into the lounge without asking.
As soon as the door closed, Dorothy dropped her smile and turned icy.
""Josephine, I heard you slept with Nathaniel, and the video is everywhere. Do you think you can win his heart with such despicable means?
""Here's the truth: he never liked you. Not only did he not like you, he hated you!
""It was me who had him spread the rumor that your mom was a mistress. I told him to pursue you. I wanted to watch you fall for him bit by bit and then have him destroy you with his own hands!""
Chapter 4
Josephine asked, ""Why?""
""Why? Of course, because you have no self-awareness. Your mother has been dead for years. Why are you still hogging the Reynolds family's things?
""Those things were supposed to be mine. You, the mistress's daughter, have no right to enjoy the Reynolds family's wealth!""
Josephine could endure anything except her mother being insulted.
She rushed at Dorothy and squeezed the words out between her teeth.
""My mother wasn't a mistress. When she married Dad, she didn't even know you or your mother existed.
""You and your family pushed her to death!""
Dorothy hadn't expected Josephine to snap back and raised her hand to slap her.
At that moment, the lounge door suddenly swung open.
Out of the corner of her eye, Josephine saw Nathaniel's figure. Dorothy panicked and quickly grabbed the nut pastries from the table and shoved them into her mouth.
The next second, she collapsed and mumbled, ""Josephine, why did you force me to eat this? I'm allergic to nuts...""
Nathaniel rushed to Dorothy and shoved Josephine aside.
Josephine stumbled back and hit the coffee table hard.
With a crash, the cups on the table shattered. Glass cut Josephine's hands until they bled.
Nathaniel didn't even glance at her. He knelt and held Dorothy.
""Dorothy, are you okay?""
Dorothy's eyes filled with tears. She grabbed Nathaniel's arm helplessly. ""I only wanted to catch up with Josie. I don't know what I did to offend her. She suddenly forced me to eat those pastries...
""Look at me. Do I have a rash?""
Nathaniel looked down and saw red rashes spreading across Dorothy's skin quickly.
""What do we do? The party isn't over. I can't embarrass you. Makeup... right, use makeup to cover it!""
Nathaniel gripped Dorothy's wrist. ""This is not the time to think about makeup. Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.""
He lifted Dorothy into his arms and, as he left, shot Josephine a cold look.
Josephine forced herself up through the pain. Blood flowed from her hands and quickly stained her dress.
But she felt no pain, as if she had fallen into an abyss and all her senses were gone.
She asked a waiter for a first-aid kit and, trembling, wrapped her wounds.
After that, Josephine was exhausted and prepared to leave with heavy steps.
She had just reached the corridor when several figures lunged out and dragged her into a storage room without warning.
A large hand gripped her chin and forced her head back. Highly concentrated chili water was poured into her mouth.
Josephine's eyes widened in terror.
Like Dorothy, she had allergies. She was naturally allergic to chili.
That much chili water could kill her.
""Ugh... stop...""
Josephine struggled wildly.
But the attackers gave her no chance. Cup after cup of chili water was poured down her throat.
She choked until her face flushed and her body convulsed uncontrollably. Her injured hands scraped the floor weakly, making a sickening sound.
Instead of stopping, they insulted her even more fiercely.
""Dorothy is Nathaniel's beloved. How dare you touch her! Don't you know your place?""
""I heard you got bullied at school and have probably been used by so many men. Nathaniel would never want a filthy woman like you.""
""Drink all this chili water. Consider it your apology to Dorothy. Or else we'll make you pay!""
Josephine's vision blurred, and her mind began to drift.
She forced out the last of her strength and muttered almost without thought, ""Nath...""
Before she finished, harsh laughter rang above her head.
""Hahaha! You really expect Nathaniel to save you?""
""He ordered us to make you drink this chili water. He wants you dead for hurting Dorothy!""
""Come on, rip her clothes off and take pictures to send to Nathaniel. Let him get some revenge!""
The men swarmed and tore Josephine's dress to pieces in an instant.
They took frantic photos of her, half-dead and barely dressed, until she couldn't hold on any longer and finally blacked out.

Hey All

I've been living and breathing car audio for over three decades. Started as a kid obsessed with making cars sound incredible, turned it into my life's work building competition systems and helping others create their dream setups.

Ten years ago, everything changed when I was diagnosed with aHUS (Atpical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome) - a rare disease that nearly killed me. I Lost my kidneys, had multiple strokes, spent 2+ years on dialysis, multiple blood clots and lost 45 pounds I've never been able to get back. Now I deal with chronic pain, handfuls of medication and need infusions every 8 weeks.

But here's the thing- my passion for this community is stronger than ever.

Since I can't physically build systems like I used to, I've pivoted to what I can do:

• Writing comprehensive how-to books and DIY guides  
•Spending hours daily answering questions across social media platforms  
• Creating detailed custom system schematics for competition and daily drivers  
•Providing complete vehicle-specific installation breakdowns- give me your make/model/year and every component you're installing (down to wire lugs and connectors), and I'll provide a full schematic including panel removal tools, bolt sizes, obstacles you'll face, and everything needed for YOUR specific vehicle and gear  
• Building the resources I wish existed when I started

Here's what makes this different: 'm currently the only person offering complete, vehicle-specific installation schematics with this level of detail. No guesswork. No YouTube ""fanboys"" giving advice that may or may not work. Just 30+ years of experience translated into step-by-step instructions for YOUR exact setup. Starting at just $7.50 to $25.00 for full 2 amp system upgrades. The best money you will ever spend, Install your product right, it will last longer.

The reality is, focusing on creating content and spending 6-8 hours daily answering questions instead of worrying about medical bills is tough. I'm not asking for charity - I'm asking this community that's given me so much to help me keep giving back.

I live in an SRO with a lot of other people our age and older.  Am I not getting hired because I'm old?  Because I'm a white dude?  IDK, this is Reddit, so I don't want to take a lot of flak on this shit.  Just tell me you're mid (late) career changes. ",8,1759387032.0,GenX,10,0.91,False

Long post sorry,"Got broken up with someone I love due to be in different stages, now I want to improve my life. Any advice or similar stories?

So I met someone. She was special—really special. The kind of person who helped me grow in ways I’m still unpacking. I struggle with OCD and childhood trauma, and a year ago, I lost my mom. It’s been a tough chapter, but meeting her was a bright, unexpected turning point. We connected through a mutual friend who mentioned she had a crush on me after seeing me in a play. Funny enough, we were cast in a show together—and before we could make a move in person, we matched on Hinge. Things just clicked. She kissed me on the first date. We liked the same music, shared similar values, and had a real connection rooted in mutual care and empathy.

She’s very direct and confident. At first, that intimidated me, but over time I began to love that about her. In fact, I began to love a lot of things that used to scare me because of my anxiety and OCD. She helped me see that I could trust, soften, and feel safe.

She taught me a lot—about cooking, about emotional regulation, about showing up for someone. I loved her deeply, and I still do. She was my biggest supporter, always cheering me on, even through the hardest moments. I’ve grown so much in the last year—especially since my mom’s death in 2024—and I credit a lot of that to her.

But a week ago, we broke up.

She works an incredibly demanding job with children, one of whom is seriously ill. And while she’s incredibly strong, I think the emotional weight of her work, combined with where I am in life, became too much. I’m still figuring things out—financially, emotionally, mentally. I’m in therapy, doing the work, and making progress. But I’m not there yet. I work part-time (with hours cut recently), deal with anxiety, and don’t have the clearest career direction. I rely on my dad for rent support, but he’s not someone I can lean on emotionally. My living situation—with roommates who are still very much in the chaotic, starving-artist phase—has been a challenge as I’ve been trying to mature and move forward. All of this weighed on the relationship. I think she saw I’m in a different phase of life. And I see it too. We cried during the breakup. She said how proud she was of me, even then. She wasn’t cruel or unreasonable—just honest. Her life is full of stress, and I know she needed to lighten her emotional load. I’m not angry. I don’t have fantasies of getting back together. But I do love her. I miss her. And I’m so incredibly grateful.We agreed to 30 days of no contact before meeting briefly to return some things—maybe over coffee. We also volunteer for the same organization, so our paths may cross again. But I’m not chasing reconciliation. I’m chasing healing. This relationship held up a mirror. I see now how anxiety and self-doubt made me question my worthiness. I see how I sometimes got defensive, which stems from old wounds. I also see how financial strain affected my ability to contribute or plan, even when my intentions were good. She was patient, and I’m learning from it all. I’ve started substitute teaching again and I’m now working with a Montessori training coordinator—exploring a future working with kids. Funny enough, that clarity came from watching how passionate and good she was at her job. I still hurt deeply. This is the kind of love that lingers in your chest long after it’s over. But I’ve talked to friends, cried, reflected, and kept going. I don’t regret anything. I just want to use this as fuel to become the person I know I can be. I wanted to write this not to dwell—but to honor it. To immortalize something that meant a lot. If you’ve ever been through something similar—if you’ve ever felt like you lost someone because you weren’t quite ready, but later found yourself, and found love again—I’d love to hear from you. Because I want to believe that’s possible. And I want to thank her—for everything. Thank you, R. ❤️ started to love her as I let myself love parts of her that scared me at first because of my anxiety and OCD, I was treated very well. She taught me so much about cooking, regulating emotions and so on. I really do love her still but basically a week ago, we broke due to her very busy job working with children one of whom is sick with a disease. I believe she realized where we are in different stages in life. She knows a lot about my trauma and the fact that I can’t emotionally rely on my dad, despite my dad helping me pay rent (I know I’m working on that) but I’ll stay overtime my OCD anxiety low pay for a part-time job that cut my hours and an overall not knowing what I wanna do with my life despite making a lot of growth through therapy and organizing things more. I think she slowly started to realize I’m in a different place and still figuring my stuff out. With that being said, I have grown a lot this year since my mom died in 2024 and she really helped me grow a lot. She has always been my biggest supporter and biggest cheerleader and even during our break up where we are both crying she said how proud she was of me, but because of the stress of her life, it was too much to take on. Now, obviously, I’m very much grieving this and wishing we could’ve worked things out. I’m not mad at her and she was in no way being unreasonable at the end of the day I want what’s best for her we are doing no contact for 30 days before I give her back her things and we might get coffee for one last meeting, though we both volunteer for the same organization. I’m not going to get back with her and I don’t wanna make this some sort of weird false mission. I think, even though she was very supportive on my mental health, I realize ways that I had self sabotage through anxiety and doubting my worthiness to be with her. On top of this, there were many times that I had trouble preparing things due to financial restraints because of the affirmation job. These were all clearly communicated in times I would get defensive and I’m realizing that this defense in this comes from childhood trauma. Other points of contention in our relationship is the fact that me and my three other roommates seem to be on different stages of life and where I’m trying to make improvement immature and they are still very much in the same mid 20s starving artist vibe so I’m thinking eventually when I get my own apartment or a small apartment with a different friend. I am currently getting back into substitute teaching and I’m able to get Monday through Friday jobs and have been in contact with the local Montessori teacher training coordinator as I think this would be a good goal for me as I like working with kids. I’ll say a lot of what I realized I wanted to do is because of what I’ve seen her do in regards to working with children. Even though right now I’m very heartbroken. I have been able to talk to so many friends about what happened and I wish we could’ve worked things out, but I think I’ll always truly be grateful for this experience honestly in a way me writing this post is kind of wanting to be immortalize What I had with her but also to seek out and see how I can get better after this break up and if anyone has had similar experiences. Would love to hear if anyone else ever feels like they may have ruined a relationship with someone special, but they got their life together and even though they did not end up with that original person were able to find someone after they had became the person that they were meant to be. I am very much I’m hurting over the fact that I won’t get to spend the rest of my life with her which I know sounds crazy, but I’ve never felt this way about someone and I know I will again with someone else. It is very hard because I still do very much love this person and I think a part of me always will even typing this out now is hard. But I wanna turn this experience in an excuse to get my life together. Thank you R, for everything ❤️ how can I be better and overcome this pain?",1,1759386838.0,ROCD,1,1.0,False

Just minutes ago, the weather had been sunny and pleasant. Then, without warning, a fog rolled in. Thick, heavy and swallowing the landscape whole. The temperature plummeted so fast it was like we’d stepped into another season. A fine mist clung to everything, beading on our hair, our clothes, the metal rail we perched on. The warmth was gone, replaced by a creeping cold that seemed to seep straight into my bones.

“Do you think a train will come through?” I asked, watching my breath curl into the mist like smoke. The tracks stretched ahead in both directions, vanishing into the pale curtain of fog.

Grace shook her head slowly, unfazed. “Doubt it. These tracks haven’t seen a train in decades. The town they used to connect to was abandoned sometime in the ’90s. My dad said the whole place just sort of… died.”

She fished a cigarette from the crumpled pack in her pocket and lit it with a practised flick. For a second, the lighter’s flame carved her face in sharp relief, highlighting her cheekbones, the slope of her nose, before it vanished again into the gloom. The warmth of the fire blends in with the natural caramel of her skin. The ember glowed faintly at the tip as she drew in a breath, then dulled as she exhaled a soft stream of smoke that mingled with the mist.

I glanced around, trying to find some kind of landmark, something familiar. All I saw was fog. A faint hiss of drizzle met the gravel at our feet, and somewhere in the distance came a hollow echo, too far away to name, too close to ignore.

We sat in silence, the quiet stretching until it felt heavier than the fog itself.

“So, why bring me out here?” I finally asked, my voice low.

“I told you.” She exhaled another ribbon of smoke, her words drifting along with it. “My parents grew up there. They left just before things went bad. I just wanted to see my parents’ hometown.”

I frowned. “Yeah, but why bring me?”

“Because all my other friends are interstate. You’re the closest.” She said it flatly, firmly, like there was nothing more to explain.

I opened my mouth to argue, then shut it again.

“We should’ve driven,” I muttered instead. “Do we even have service out here?”

“Dude, can you shut up and just be a good friend?” Grace shot me a look, equal parts exasperation and amusement. She wasn’t wrong. This trip mattered to her, and I was turning it into a checklist of complaints. So, I shut my mouth and nodded.

She finished her cigarette down to the filter, crushed it against the gravel with the toe of her Converse, and stood abruptly. “C’mon. We should get there soon so we’re not walking back in the dark.”

“This is why we should’ve driven,” I grumbled, pushing myself off the rail.

“Don’t be stupid. The roads are blocked off. Do you think your poor Barina, or my poor Laser, could possibly survive off-road?” She raised her eyebrows, daring me to answer.

I pictured our sad little cars bogged down in mud, bumpers scraping over rocks, wheels spinning uselessly. The image made me grin despite myself. She was right. I was being stupid.

“Fine,” I said, adjusting my bag. “Lead the way.”

And with that, we set off down the tracks, into the fog, heading toward the town I already wished we’d never decided to find.

 

We kept walking for another twenty minutes, half of it in silence, half of it filled with the kind of useless bullshit we found entertaining.

Grace and I had been friends for a few years. I still remember the first time I met her. We initially met in a film class at university during one of those mandatory group projects they assign. We both picked the class as a random elective to add credits to our degrees. I was getting my bachelor’s in music at the time, and Grace was getting her master’s in psychology. I remember Grace sitting across from me, her hair neatly pulled back, her dark fingers thoughtfully tapping her notebook. She considered every one of my thoughts with an intense focus that made me lose my train of thought. I've never been good at making friends and was at a total loss for words, but Grace always had a confident answer ready; she seemed to know what to say.

That first day, I asked her what her favourite movie was. It was supposed to be an icebreaker, but she didn’t answer right away. She tilted her head, like the question was more complicated than I’d meant it to be.

“I don’t know, dude, that’s a hard question. Like, how could I even begin? All art is a conversation, and to say a film is better than another is to ignore that conversation entirely. Like how Michael Haneke’s *Funny Games* is a clear response to the 80s slasher craze, or how *Vertigo* twists the whole detective-thriller formula, y’know?”

I just stared at her for a second, dumbfounded. She’d always been smarter than me, or at least knew how to sound like it.

She shrugged, as if aware she’d lost me. “But if I had to pick? Alejandro Jodorowsky’s *The Holy Mountain.*” A small smile tugged at her lips, daring me to call her pretentious. “How about you?”

I cleared my throat, suddenly aware of how average I sounded next to her. “Uh… probably *Spider-Man 2.*”

Her grin broke wide, “*Spider-Man 2?”* she said in a cheeky tone, and just like that, we’d talked for hours.

Back in the fog, I found myself glancing sideways at her, that same grin flickering in my memory. Grace always had a way of making things bigger than they seemed. She

“What do you think, uh, what’s the town called?” I stumbled

“Hollowbend, I told you like five times.” She said, half annoyed,

“Right, Hollowbend. Anyway, what do you think the state we’ll find it in will be?”

“I don’t know. Probably overgrown, smashed windows, graffiti. The same state you find in all abandoned places.”

A shadow moved in the fog ahead, tall and thin, or maybe it was just a tree twisted against the mist. My stomach tightened. “That… that looks like a building.”

Grace squinted. “Finally. You’re catching on. That’s probably the old general store. I don’t think Hollowbend had much else besides that and the church.”

As we drew closer, the outlines became clearer: a single-story wooden building, paint peeling in strips, windows caked with grime. One of the panes had a jagged hole, and through it, darkness stared back at us. A sudden scuttle of something small, rats, maybe, made me jump. On the notice board out front was a map of the town dated from the late 60s. Some residential areas down the road, the church, the store and a few extra buildings. It was about as big as she said.

“See?” Grace said softly, almost to herself. “Everything’s exactly as it should be. Like frozen in time.”

“Some Silent Hill type shit,” I muttered.

We lingered at the threshold, hesitant. The door hung crooked on its hinges. I could see the faint outline of shelves inside, dusty and bare, a spider web stretched across a forgotten corner. My heart beat a little faster.

“Ladies first,”

“Pussy.”

“Hey man, I just think this is a bit creepy,” I said defensively.

Rolling her eyes, she pushed on the door. It creaked and came half off its hinges, groaning like it hadn’t been touched in decades. Grace stepped inside, and I followed reluctantly.

The air smelled sour. Rot and mildew. Dust clung to every surface. Shelves stood half-collapsed, their contents scattered across the floor. Behind the counter, cash drawers hung open, coins dulled with grime. What was left of fruit and vegetables lay in blackened heaps, alive with maggots and ants.

“Great first impression,” I muttered.

Grace smirked. “Maybe there’s more in the manager’s office.”

We edged toward the back. Each step stirred the silence, our shoes crunching on broken glass and warped floorboards. Grace pushed on the door.

“Help, it’s stuck.”

Together, we rammed into the door with our shoulders, which tore the door off the wall.

 

“What the fuck?”

 

The manager’s office wasn’t an office at all. The room was bare. no desk, no shelves, not even dust. Just a single structure in the centre: three walls, a low roof, and a stairwell that descended into darkness.

The office was as large as the entire shopfront we’d just walked through. From the outside, the building wasn’t nearly big enough to hold both spaces. It was like the store had doubled on the inside.

Grace stepped forward, her voice hushed, almost reverent. “This… this isn’t possible.”

I swallowed hard, staring at the stairwell. Grace took a step forward.

 

“We shouldn’t-” I started, but she cut me off with a single look.

“Marc.”

“Fuck me.”

We made our descent.

 

The deeper we went, the more the dark closed around us. Our phone torches cut thin beams into the black, but it was like shining light into ink; the glow barely reached the next step ahead. Every breath felt swallowed, every sound dulled. It wasn’t just dark. It was a kind of dark that ate the light whole. Ten steps. Fifteen. The rectangle of light above us vanished, swallowed whole. I looked back, but the doorway was gone. Just black.

“Grace…” My voice cracked. “I don’t think this staircase ends.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” she shot back, but I heard the strain in her voice.

The stairs kept going, a twisting descent into a silence that felt heavier than the damp air. My phone, held in a trembling hand, showed no change in temperature, but my breath still fogged in the oppressive gloom. Each step on the slick stone was a small, echoing sound that was immediately swallowed by the profound darkness. Twenty steps became thirty, then fifty, and I felt a dizzying sense that we weren't just going down, but folding inward, pulled by some unseen force deeper than should be possible.

Grace's silence was more unnerving than any complaint I could have made. She kept her torch fixed on the steps ahead, her face a mask of fierce concentration. This was her mission, and a part of me felt like she was a sleepwalker on a path only she could see. When the stairs finally ended, they didn’t lead to another hallway or room, but to a massive, metal door. It was rusted and pitted, with a heavy, circular handle. We shared a look, a silent agreement that there was no turning back now.

""Ready?"" I whispered, my voice a dry rasp.

She didn't answer, just grabbed the handle and braced herself. I put my shoulder against the cold metal, and together we pulled. The door groaned, a terrible, scraping shriek of protest that seemed to tear through the solid rock around us. As it slowly opened, a light escaped, casting a pale glow on the stairwell.

We squeezed through the narrow opening. Instead of a dusty cellar or another derelict room, we stood in a clean, albeit unorganised, office. Sitting at a desk, looking over some paperwork, caught up in thought, was a balding man, maybe in his 40s.

""Hello?"" I let out after a few seconds.

The man jumped slightly, clearly startled. He looked up, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He seemed to take in our muddy shoes and wind-whipped hair before his gaze landed on the gaping hole where the door had been.

""Who the hell are you guys?"" he asked, his voice a tight coil of anger and confusion. ""What are you doing here? Customers aren't supposed to be back here.""

We just stared at him, unable to form a coherent response. The sheer normalcy of the man was more unsettling than some faceless figure I’d conjured in my mind. He wore a simple button-up shirt and khakis, and the desk was littered with pens and half-empty coffee mugs. The only thing out of place was us.

""We… uh… we just followed the stairs,"" Grace finally managed to stammer, her voice a reedy whisper.

The man looked with a mix of frustration and confusion and ran a hand through the small amount of his hair. ""The stairs? Right, look, whatever you're doing, you need to leave.”

I turned to look behind us. My heart lurched. Where the heavy steel door had stood was now just a broom closet.

“Where are we?” I blurted.

The man looked at me like I was simple. “You’re in my office. Hollowbend General Store. And you’re not supposed to be here.” He tapped his papers. “Now, please. My schedule’s full until ’93.”

My stomach dropped. I turned to Grace, who looked pale, her face a mixture of disbelief and horror.

She cleared her throat. “Sir… what year is it?”

He stared at her, a look of complete bewilderment on his face. ""It's 1992. October. Are you two alright? You seem a little out of sorts. Is the heat getting to you?""

A cold, internal dread settled in the pit of my stomach. ""No, we're fine, just a bit unsettled. We'll leave you in peace,"" I said, gently pushing Grace toward the door.

""Wait.""

We stopped and turned back to face him. He opened a desk drawer, pulled out two plastic water bottles, and tossed them to us. ""Stay hydrated, guys.""

""Thanks,"" we said in unison.

We walked through the general store, now transformed into a nice, cleaned-up grocery instead of the forgotten shell we saw previously. Leaving through the front, revealing a vibrant street scene. The view was pristine and alive with people. A postman in a neat uniform walking down the street, kids on bicycles, and a few old Holden cars parked along the curb. The harsh sunlight, warm and bright, was a stark contrast to the unnatural grey mist that had just swallowed us. A man sweeping his driveway gave us a wave.

“Morning, folks! Lovely day for a visit, isn’t it?” His voice carried the warmth of a sitcom dad, and yet the way his eyes locked on us made my chest tighten.

Grace nodded politely. “Yeah. Lovely day.”

We walked on. At the corner stood the general store, bright and clean, nothing like the ruin we’d first stepped into. Its big window gleamed, and a neat poster announced *Fresh Bread Every Morning!* Behind the glass, I could see the same man from the office, head bent over his papers again, exactly as we’d left him.

Across the street, a woman in an apron leaned from a bakery window. “You must be new in town!” she called, her voice as cheerful as a song. Her flour-dusted hands waved as if she’d been expecting us.

Grace offered a thin smile. “Just visiting.”

“Oh, visitors!” The woman clapped her hands. “How exciting! You’ll love Hollowbend. We always take care of our own here.” She said it so warmly that it almost felt like a promise.

At the corner stood a diner, its neon sign buzzing faintly: **The Hollowbelly.** Through the window, we saw people laughing, eating, and talking, yet not a single sound leaked out. The silence felt unnatural. But when the door opened, the noise hit all at once, as if the laughter and chatter had been bottled up and unleashed.

“Coffee?” a waitress asked the moment we sat at the counter. Her voice carried a broad rural country lilt; the vowels stretched just a bit too wide. She was tall, her beehive hairdo flawless, her uniform spotless. Her nametag read **BETTY**, though the letters were worn almost to nothing.

“Uh… sure,” I said.

She poured without looking at the cup, and not a drop spilled.

Grace tilted her head at the counter around us. “Huh. It’s like one of those 50s diners from old movies.”

“I’ll tell you what, though,” I said, gulping down the drink. “This is a damn good cup of coffee.”

Grace didn’t answer. Her cup sat untouched, steam curling up, until the curl slowed, then froze in mid-air, hanging motionless like a painted line.

“Marc,” she whispered, her grip tightening on my hand. “I think we shouldn’t have come here.”

“I hate to be a smart ass, but it was you who kept pushing for us to keep going,” I said, sipping again.

“Yeah, but I didn’t think we’d get stuck here.”

Grace’s eyes locked on her cup, lips pressed to a thin line. Behind the counter, Betty polished a glass with a rag that never seemed to get damp, her movements slow, circular, hypnotic.

“You don’t like it?” Betty asked suddenly, her eyes flicking to Grace’s untouched drink.

Grace flinched. “Oh, no, it’s fine. I’m just… not thirsty.”

“If you don’t mind, then,” I slid her cup over to me.

Betty let out a soft laugh. “My, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone like the coffee nearly as much as you.” She kept smiling, as if waiting for me to agree with her.

I chuckled awkwardly. “Guess I’m just a coffee guy.”

“That’s good,” Betty said, nodding too quickly. “Good to know.” She jotted something down on her order pad, though we hadn’t asked for anything else.

A man in overalls shuffled past our stools and took a seat two spots down. He turned toward us immediately, grinning as if we were old friends.

“You two married?” he asked.

Grace blinked. “Uh… no.”

“Shame,” he said, still smiling. “You look married.” He reached for the sugar jar, though he didn’t have a coffee.

Betty leaned across the counter, cheerful as ever. “They just got here, Frank. Don’t scare them off.”

“Not scaring,” Frank said earnestly. “Just asking. That’s how you get to know people. You ask.”

Betty nodded. “He’s right. You do have to ask.”

Grace pressed her lips together and stared at the counter.

“Uh, how long have you uh, lived in this town for?” I managed to stumble out.

“Well, my home life, frankly. Yep, grew up here. It was even smaller back in the day, but now, because of all that industrialisation, people moving to the cities and all, we’ve added buildings slowly and slowly, and now we’re a proper functioning town. But I decided staying was the best for me because I love Hollowbend and I just never found a great reason to leave and, well, I suppose if you never find a reason to go then you just… don’t.”

I’m not sure if I even saw Betty breathe once throughout that whole verbal dump.

Grace forced a polite smile. “That’s… nice.”

Betty leaned closer, lowering her voice as though she were sharing a secret. “And the thing is, everyone who comes here ends up staying. People say it’s the pies, but I think it’s the way the streets feel under your shoes. You know? Comfortable.” She nodded to herself, satisfied.

Frank clapped his hands together suddenly, startling both of us. “Well, now that’s settled. What are your thoughts on root vegetables?”

My mouth opened and closed a few times. Grace blinked.

“They’re… fine?” I offered.

Frank beamed. “Good man. A town can’t run without a good beet crop. Everyone says so.”

Betty chimed in, smiling wide. “Yes, everyone says so.”

Grace and I looked at each other for a few seconds, utter bewilderment and confusion upon our faces.

“Well, I guess we’d best be on our way. Is there uh, a place to stay? Like a motel or something.”

Before realising the mistake I had just made, Betty was already spouting off about the town history and how there used not to be a hotel, but now there is, and who owns it. In that verbal diarrhea, we did manage to hear the name.

“…**Friendly Pines Motel**,” I repeated slowly, as if saying it aloud would help it make sense.

“Yes! That’s the one,” Betty said, nodding like she’d just handed us the map to paradise. “Very nice. Can’t miss it. Just down Main Street, past the church, turn left at the bank, you’ll see the sign, bright green, says ‘Friendly Pines’ in big, cheerful letters. Don’t worry, dear, you’ll be fine.”

“Great, thanks, Betty.” Grace said, trying to push me out the door.

“Grace, we didn’t pay,” I reminded her, tugging gently on her sleeve.

Betty waved a hand dismissively, a wide, confident smile on her face. “Oh, don’t you worry about that, dear. Coffees on the house. Happens all the time for visitors; some of them never even bring coins. Not that you’d notice.” She gave a little laugh, but it was the kind of laugh that made it feel like she genuinely didn’t see the need for any explanation.

Quickly leaving before we could be roped back into another conversation, we started to walk down the road towards the motel.

“How are we even going to pay for this?” Grace wondered, “I mean, it’s not like we carry cash, and I doubt our credit cards would even work.”

“I was just thinking the same thing. I guess we could always try with our cards and hope for the best.” I offered up.

We walked in silence for a few steps; the town’s neat little streets were lined with brick and timber buildings that seemed almost self-conscious about the space they occupied. Each storefront was meticulously kept, with paint that shone just enough to suggest pride without drawing too much attention. The lampposts were perfectly spaced, the sidewalks swept clean, and yet the precision made everything feel a little unnatural.

Grace’s gaze drifted to the waterfront on our right, the sunlight glinting off the water in a way that made the small bay look almost like a hidden gem, tucked just out of sight. “I didn’t even know this was here,” she murmured, her voice quiet, almost hesitant. “My parents never mentioned it.”

I squinted against the glare, the waves catching the light in fleeting patterns. “Yeah… It’s like the town hides itself until it wants to be seen,” I said, feeling a shiver contrasting with the afternoon sun.

She frowned, tilting her head, as if trying to make sense of the shapes and lines of the streets. “Almost as if it’s trying to condense itself as much as possible, but parts keep spilling out”.

We walked in silence the rest of the way to the motel, passing countless people that seemed too many for the size of the town. The sidewalks were crowded with small conversations: a man leaning too close to a woman as he told a story with exaggerated hand movements; a pair of teenagers laughing a fraction too loud at something unfunny; an old lady sweeping her porch in slow, deliberate strokes, nodding at every passerby as if acknowledging them for an invisible roll call.

The Friendly Pines Motel loomed ahead, its sign in cheery green letters glowing faintly even in the daylight. The exterior was modest, almost shy, but when we stepped through the glass doors, the lobby stretched out before us like it belonged to a completely different building.

Two curved grand staircases swept out from either side of the front desk, their red-carpeted steps climbing upward in perfect symmetry before vanishing around opposite corners. Polished wooden banisters gleamed under the warm light of chandeliers, which swung just slightly, though there was no breeze.

The air smelled faintly of pine and lemon polish. A grandfather clock ticked steadily in the corner, its pendulum swinging a half-beat slower than seemed natural.

Grace stopped short. “This is… not what I expected.”

“WELCOME!” a booming voice rang out from the top of the grand staircase, startling both of us.

We looked up to see a man standing there, striking a pose as though the entire lobby were his stage. He was dressed head to toe in elaborate attire: a deep burgundy tailcoat with gold trim, a towering black top hat perched at a jaunty angle, and a long black cane tipped with a silver wolf’s head. His handlebar moustache was so extravagantly curled it seemed to defy gravity.

Beside him stood a woman, equally theatrical in style, her sequined dress glittering under the chandelier light as if she’d stepped straight out of a 1920s burlesque reel. A feathered headpiece curved upward from her hair, but her face was locked into a scowl of annoyance and hate targeted towards us.

We watched in stunned silence as the man hooked his cane on the railing and, with surprising grace, slid down the banister in a single sweeping motion. The woman followed at his side, descending the staircase with a slinky, deliberate sway.

They landed before us with a flourish.

“Ah, newcomers!” the man announced, sweeping his hat from his head and bowing low, his moustache twitching with the motion. “Welcome, welcome to our fine establishment! I am…” He paused dramatically; cane raised to the ceiling as though summoning lightning. “…Mr. Alastair DuPont, owner and humble servant to all who seek rest beneath the Friendly Pines!”

He struck a pose. For a moment, the air seemed to thrum, and we thought we heard what sounded like a smattering of applause and cheers, but from nowhere in particular.

“And this young thing,” he continued, swooping an arm toward his companion, “is my beautiful wife, Everlyn.”

He bent down with exaggerated gallantry, kissing her hand before springing back upright with theatrical speed. Everlyn, maintaining her poise, slowly reached into her clutch and produced a baby wipe. She wiped hard at the exact spot where his lips had touched, expression unchanged, then discarded the wipe neatly into a handbag without breaking eye contact with us.

“Pleasure.” She said with a tone that just oozed venom and contempt, though Mr DuPont didn’t seem to mind. Grace and I exchanged glances. Their contrast extended to more than just their attitudes. Her accent, thick and Australian, while DuPont spoke with a mock American accent, like a prototype Transatlantic accent.  The whole performance felt rehearsed, like we'd walked into the middle of a play that had been running for decades. ""We, uh, we'd like a room,"" I managed, my voice cracking slightly.  ""Of course, of course!"" Mr DuPont exclaimed, spinning his cane like a baton before catching it with a flourish. “We shall prepare for you our finest room. Come,” and he immediately started speed walking in the opposite direction, back up the stairs. We tried to follow behind him, but we struggled to keep up with him through all the twists and turns of the motel. Mr DuPont moved with impossible speed, his coat tails billowing behind him as he navigated the maze-like interior with the confidence of someone who'd walked these paths for decades. “Keep up, keep up!"" he called over his shoulder, his voice echoing off the walls.

Finally, Mr DuPont stopped in front of a door marked with a brass plaque that simply read ""The Suite."" He produced an elaborate skeleton key from his waistcoat and turned it with a ceremonial flourish. “Your palace awaits!"" he announced, throwing the door open with a dramatic sweep of his arm.

 “Palace” was a massive overstatement. The room had a double bed that had a noticeable sag in the middle, along with a single nightstand that looked straight out of the 50s. There was a small armchair wedged awkwardly in the narrow gap between the bed and the wall. The wallpaper was a faded floral pattern, peeling at the corners where moisture had crept in over the years. A thin brown carpet covered the floor, worn through to the backing in a path from the door to the bed. Heavy curtains covered the single window.

“This is….” I started to say before being interrupted by, “I know, it’s a lot to take in.” Mr DuPont said, beaming with pride. “The best part is, it’s only $100 a night!” Grace gave me a quick look before asking, “Is there a possibility we could get two single beds in here?”

DuPont looked at us very blankly and said, “No,” before quickly getting back in character. “Well, I’ll leave you two to settle in, I’ll just take your card, and I’ll charge you after your stay comes to an end.”

That worked out conveniently for us.

Grace sat heavily on the sagging bed, which creaked ominously under her weight. She pulled her hair free from its tie, letting it fall around her face as she rubbed her temples ""Marc, this is so fucked.""

""I know."" I slumped into the armchair, which was even more uncomfortable than it looked. The springs had given up years ago. ""How do we get back?""

Grace was quiet for a long time, staring out the window at the timeless street scene below. ""What if we can't get back? What if this is just... our life now?""

“I doubt it’s that dire, Grace. I’m sure everything will be fine.” I was bluffing. I just wanted to say something that would make us both feel better.

""Since we're in ‘92, wanna try finding your parents?"" I suggested, mostly to fill the silence.

Grace shifted uncomfortably. ""I don't know. They always got weird when I brought up Hollowbend. Never wanted to talk about it."" She paused. ""But I guess it would be interesting to see what they were like back then.""

She yawned and looked at the single bed. ""So... how are we handling sleeping arrangements?""

I glanced at the uncomfortable armchair. ""I'll take the chair. I've slept in worse places.""

""Don't be ridiculous. We're both adults. We can share a bed without making it weird.""

""If you're sure...""

""I'm sure. Besides,"" she said, settling onto one side of the bed, ""if we're stuck in 1992 forever, we might as well get comfortable.""

I took the other side, both of us staying fully clothed and keeping to our respective edges of the sagging mattress.",1,1759386762.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Just minutes ago, the weather had been sunny and pleasant. Then, without warning, a fog rolled in. Thick, heavy and swallowing the landscape whole. The temperature plummeted so fast it was like we’d stepped into another season. A fine mist clung to everything, beading on our hair, our clothes, the metal rail we perched on. The warmth was gone, replaced by a creeping cold that seemed to seep straight into my bones.

“Do you think a train will come through?” I asked, watching my breath curl into the mist like smoke. The tracks stretched ahead in both directions, vanishing into the pale curtain of fog.

Grace shook her head slowly, unfazed. “Doubt it. These tracks haven’t seen a train in decades. The town they used to connect to was abandoned sometime in the ’90s. My dad said the whole place just sort of… died.”

She fished a cigarette from the crumpled pack in her pocket and lit it with a practised flick. For a second, the lighter’s flame carved her face in sharp relief, highlighting her cheekbones, the slope of her nose, before it vanished again into the gloom. The warmth of the fire blends in with the natural caramel of her skin. The ember glowed faintly at the tip as she drew in a breath, then dulled as she exhaled a soft stream of smoke that mingled with the mist.

I glanced around, trying to find some kind of landmark, something familiar. All I saw was fog. A faint hiss of drizzle met the gravel at our feet, and somewhere in the distance came a hollow echo, too far away to name, too close to ignore.

We sat in silence, the quiet stretching until it felt heavier than the fog itself.

“So, why bring me out here?” I finally asked, my voice low.

“I told you.” She exhaled another ribbon of smoke, her words drifting along with it. “My parents grew up there. They left just before things went bad. I just wanted to see my parents’ hometown.”

I frowned. “Yeah, but why bring me?”

“Because all my other friends are interstate. You’re the closest.” She said it flatly, firmly, like there was nothing more to explain.

I opened my mouth to argue, then shut it again.

“We should’ve driven,” I muttered instead. “Do we even have service out here?”

“Dude, can you shut up and just be a good friend?” Grace shot me a look, equal parts exasperation and amusement. She wasn’t wrong. This trip mattered to her, and I was turning it into a checklist of complaints. So, I shut my mouth and nodded.

She finished her cigarette down to the filter, crushed it against the gravel with the toe of her Converse, and stood abruptly. “C’mon. We should get there soon so we’re not walking back in the dark.”

“This is why we should’ve driven,” I grumbled, pushing myself off the rail.

“Don’t be stupid. The roads are blocked off. Do you think your poor Barina, or my poor Laser, could possibly survive off-road?” She raised her eyebrows, daring me to answer.

I pictured our sad little cars bogged down in mud, bumpers scraping over rocks, wheels spinning uselessly. The image made me grin despite myself. She was right. I was being stupid.

“Fine,” I said, adjusting my bag. “Lead the way.”

And with that, we set off down the tracks, into the fog, heading toward the town I already wished we’d never decided to find.

 

We kept walking for another twenty minutes, half of it in silence, half of it filled with the kind of useless bullshit we found entertaining.

Grace and I had been friends for a few years. I still remember the first time I met her. We initially met in a film class at university during one of those mandatory group projects they assign. We both picked the class as a random elective to add credits to our degrees. I was getting my bachelor’s in music at the time, and Grace was getting her master’s in psychology. I remember Grace sitting across from me, her hair neatly pulled back, her dark fingers thoughtfully tapping her notebook. She considered every one of my thoughts with an intense focus that made me lose my train of thought. I've never been good at making friends and was at a total loss for words, but Grace always had a confident answer ready; she seemed to know what to say.

That first day, I asked her what her favourite movie was. It was supposed to be an icebreaker, but she didn’t answer right away. She tilted her head, like the question was more complicated than I’d meant it to be.

“I don’t know, dude, that’s a hard question. Like, how could I even begin? All art is a conversation, and to say a film is better than another is to ignore that conversation entirely. Like how Michael Haneke’s *Funny Games* is a clear response to the 80s slasher craze, or how *Vertigo* twists the whole detective-thriller formula, y’know?”

I just stared at her for a second, dumbfounded. She’d always been smarter than me, or at least knew how to sound like it.

She shrugged, as if aware she’d lost me. “But if I had to pick? Alejandro Jodorowsky’s *The Holy Mountain.*” A small smile tugged at her lips, daring me to call her pretentious. “How about you?”

I cleared my throat, suddenly aware of how average I sounded next to her. “Uh… probably *Spider-Man 2.*”

Her grin broke wide, “*Spider-Man 2?”* she said in a cheeky tone, and just like that, we’d talked for hours.

Back in the fog, I found myself glancing sideways at her, that same grin flickering in my memory. Grace always had a way of making things bigger than they seemed. She

“What do you think, uh, what’s the town called?” I stumbled

“Hollowbend, I told you like five times.” She said, half annoyed,

“Right, Hollowbend. Anyway, what do you think the state we’ll find it in will be?”

“I don’t know. Probably overgrown, smashed windows, graffiti. The same state you find in all abandoned places.”

A shadow moved in the fog ahead, tall and thin, or maybe it was just a tree twisted against the mist. My stomach tightened. “That… that looks like a building.”

Grace squinted. “Finally. You’re catching on. That’s probably the old general store. I don’t think Hollowbend had much else besides that and the church.”

As we drew closer, the outlines became clearer: a single-story wooden building, paint peeling in strips, windows caked with grime. One of the panes had a jagged hole, and through it, darkness stared back at us. A sudden scuttle of something small, rats, maybe, made me jump. On the notice board out front was a map of the town dated from the late 60s. Some residential areas down the road, the church, the store and a few extra buildings. It was about as big as she said.

“See?” Grace said softly, almost to herself. “Everything’s exactly as it should be. Like frozen in time.”

“Some Silent Hill type shit,” I muttered.

We lingered at the threshold, hesitant. The door hung crooked on its hinges. I could see the faint outline of shelves inside, dusty and bare, a spider web stretched across a forgotten corner. My heart beat a little faster.

“Ladies first,”

“Pussy.”

“Hey man, I just think this is a bit creepy,” I said defensively.

Rolling her eyes, she pushed on the door. It creaked and came half off its hinges, groaning like it hadn’t been touched in decades. Grace stepped inside, and I followed reluctantly.

The air smelled sour. Rot and mildew. Dust clung to every surface. Shelves stood half-collapsed, their contents scattered across the floor. Behind the counter, cash drawers hung open, coins dulled with grime. What was left of fruit and vegetables lay in blackened heaps, alive with maggots and ants.

“Great first impression,” I muttered.

Grace smirked. “Maybe there’s more in the manager’s office.”

We edged toward the back. Each step stirred the silence, our shoes crunching on broken glass and warped floorboards. Grace pushed on the door.

“Help, it’s stuck.”

Together, we rammed into the door with our shoulders, which tore the door off the wall.

 

“What the fuck?”

 

The manager’s office wasn’t an office at all. The room was bare. no desk, no shelves, not even dust. Just a single structure in the centre: three walls, a low roof, and a stairwell that descended into darkness.

The office was as large as the entire shopfront we’d just walked through. From the outside, the building wasn’t nearly big enough to hold both spaces. It was like the store had doubled on the inside.

Grace stepped forward, her voice hushed, almost reverent. “This… this isn’t possible.”

I swallowed hard, staring at the stairwell. Grace took a step forward.

 

“We shouldn’t-” I started, but she cut me off with a single look.

“Marc.”

“Fuck me.”

We made our descent.

 

The deeper we went, the more the dark closed around us. Our phone torches cut thin beams into the black, but it was like shining light into ink; the glow barely reached the next step ahead. Every breath felt swallowed, every sound dulled. It wasn’t just dark. It was a kind of dark that ate the light whole. Ten steps. Fifteen. The rectangle of light above us vanished, swallowed whole. I looked back, but the doorway was gone. Just black.

“Grace…” My voice cracked. “I don’t think this staircase ends.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” she shot back, but I heard the strain in her voice.

The stairs kept going, a twisting descent into a silence that felt heavier than the damp air. My phone, held in a trembling hand, showed no change in temperature, but my breath still fogged in the oppressive gloom. Each step on the slick stone was a small, echoing sound that was immediately swallowed by the profound darkness. Twenty steps became thirty, then fifty, and I felt a dizzying sense that we weren't just going down, but folding inward, pulled by some unseen force deeper than should be possible.

Grace's silence was more unnerving than any complaint I could have made. She kept her torch fixed on the steps ahead, her face a mask of fierce concentration. This was her mission, and a part of me felt like she was a sleepwalker on a path only she could see. When the stairs finally ended, they didn’t lead to another hallway or room, but to a massive, metal door. It was rusted and pitted, with a heavy, circular handle. We shared a look, a silent agreement that there was no turning back now.

""Ready?"" I whispered, my voice a dry rasp.

She didn't answer, just grabbed the handle and braced herself. I put my shoulder against the cold metal, and together we pulled. The door groaned, a terrible, scraping shriek of protest that seemed to tear through the solid rock around us. As it slowly opened, a light escaped, casting a pale glow on the stairwell.

We squeezed through the narrow opening. Instead of a dusty cellar or another derelict room, we stood in a clean, albeit unorganised, office. Sitting at a desk, looking over some paperwork, caught up in thought, was a balding man, maybe in his 40s.

""Hello?"" I let out after a few seconds.

The man jumped slightly, clearly startled. He looked up, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He seemed to take in our muddy shoes and wind-whipped hair before his gaze landed on the gaping hole where the door had been.

""Who the hell are you guys?"" he asked, his voice a tight coil of anger and confusion. ""What are you doing here? Customers aren't supposed to be back here.""

We just stared at him, unable to form a coherent response. The sheer normalcy of the man was more unsettling than some faceless figure I’d conjured in my mind. He wore a simple button-up shirt and khakis, and the desk was littered with pens and half-empty coffee mugs. The only thing out of place was us.

""We… uh… we just followed the stairs,"" Grace finally managed to stammer, her voice a reedy whisper.

The man looked with a mix of frustration and confusion and ran a hand through the small amount of his hair. ""The stairs? Right, look, whatever you're doing, you need to leave.”

I turned to look behind us. My heart lurched. Where the heavy steel door had stood was now just a broom closet.

“Where are we?” I blurted.

The man looked at me like I was simple. “You’re in my office. Hollowbend General Store. And you’re not supposed to be here.” He tapped his papers. “Now, please. My schedule’s full until ’93.”

My stomach dropped. I turned to Grace, who looked pale, her face a mixture of disbelief and horror.

She cleared her throat. “Sir… what year is it?”

He stared at her, a look of complete bewilderment on his face. ""It's 1992. October. Are you two alright? You seem a little out of sorts. Is the heat getting to you?""

A cold, internal dread settled in the pit of my stomach. ""No, we're fine, just a bit unsettled. We'll leave you in peace,"" I said, gently pushing Grace toward the door.

""Wait.""

We stopped and turned back to face him. He opened a desk drawer, pulled out two plastic water bottles, and tossed them to us. ""Stay hydrated, guys.""

""Thanks,"" we said in unison.

We walked through the general store, now transformed into a nice, cleaned-up grocery instead of the forgotten shell we saw previously. Leaving through the front, revealing a vibrant street scene. The view was pristine and alive with people. A postman in a neat uniform walking down the street, kids on bicycles, and a few old Holden cars parked along the curb. The harsh sunlight, warm and bright, was a stark contrast to the unnatural grey mist that had just swallowed us. A man sweeping his driveway gave us a wave.

“Morning, folks! Lovely day for a visit, isn’t it?” His voice carried the warmth of a sitcom dad, and yet the way his eyes locked on us made my chest tighten.

Grace nodded politely. “Yeah. Lovely day.”

We walked on. At the corner stood the general store, bright and clean, nothing like the ruin we’d first stepped into. Its big window gleamed, and a neat poster announced *Fresh Bread Every Morning!* Behind the glass, I could see the same man from the office, head bent over his papers again, exactly as we’d left him.

Across the street, a woman in an apron leaned from a bakery window. “You must be new in town!” she called, her voice as cheerful as a song. Her flour-dusted hands waved as if she’d been expecting us.

Grace offered a thin smile. “Just visiting.”

“Oh, visitors!” The woman clapped her hands. “How exciting! You’ll love Hollowbend. We always take care of our own here.” She said it so warmly that it almost felt like a promise.

At the corner stood a diner, its neon sign buzzing faintly: **The Hollowbelly.** Through the window, we saw people laughing, eating, and talking, yet not a single sound leaked out. The silence felt unnatural. But when the door opened, the noise hit all at once, as if the laughter and chatter had been bottled up and unleashed.

“Coffee?” a waitress asked the moment we sat at the counter. Her voice carried a broad rural country lilt; the vowels stretched just a bit too wide. She was tall, her beehive hairdo flawless, her uniform spotless. Her nametag read **BETTY**, though the letters were worn almost to nothing.

“Uh… sure,” I said.

She poured without looking at the cup, and not a drop spilled.

Grace tilted her head at the counter around us. “Huh. It’s like one of those 50s diners from old movies.”

“I’ll tell you what, though,” I said, gulping down the drink. “This is a damn good cup of coffee.”

Grace didn’t answer. Her cup sat untouched, steam curling up, until the curl slowed, then froze in mid-air, hanging motionless like a painted line.

“Marc,” she whispered, her grip tightening on my hand. “I think we shouldn’t have come here.”

“I hate to be a smart ass, but it was you who kept pushing for us to keep going,” I said, sipping again.

“Yeah, but I didn’t think we’d get stuck here.”

Grace’s eyes locked on her cup, lips pressed to a thin line. Behind the counter, Betty polished a glass with a rag that never seemed to get damp, her movements slow, circular, hypnotic.

“You don’t like it?” Betty asked suddenly, her eyes flicking to Grace’s untouched drink.

Grace flinched. “Oh, no, it’s fine. I’m just… not thirsty.”

“If you don’t mind, then,” I slid her cup over to me.

Betty let out a soft laugh. “My, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone like the coffee nearly as much as you.” She kept smiling, as if waiting for me to agree with her.

I chuckled awkwardly. “Guess I’m just a coffee guy.”

“That’s good,” Betty said, nodding too quickly. “Good to know.” She jotted something down on her order pad, though we hadn’t asked for anything else.

A man in overalls shuffled past our stools and took a seat two spots down. He turned toward us immediately, grinning as if we were old friends.

“You two married?” he asked.

Grace blinked. “Uh… no.”

“Shame,” he said, still smiling. “You look married.” He reached for the sugar jar, though he didn’t have a coffee.

Betty leaned across the counter, cheerful as ever. “They just got here, Frank. Don’t scare them off.”

“Not scaring,” Frank said earnestly. “Just asking. That’s how you get to know people. You ask.”

Betty nodded. “He’s right. You do have to ask.”

Grace pressed her lips together and stared at the counter.

“Uh, how long have you uh, lived in this town for?” I managed to stumble out.

“Well, my home life, frankly. Yep, grew up here. It was even smaller back in the day, but now, because of all that industrialisation, people moving to the cities and all, we’ve added buildings slowly and slowly, and now we’re a proper functioning town. But I decided staying was the best for me because I love Hollowbend and I just never found a great reason to leave and, well, I suppose if you never find a reason to go then you just… don’t.”

I’m not sure if I even saw Betty breathe once throughout that whole verbal dump.

Grace forced a polite smile. “That’s… nice.”

Betty leaned closer, lowering her voice as though she were sharing a secret. “And the thing is, everyone who comes here ends up staying. People say it’s the pies, but I think it’s the way the streets feel under your shoes. You know? Comfortable.” She nodded to herself, satisfied.

Frank clapped his hands together suddenly, startling both of us. “Well, now that’s settled. What are your thoughts on root vegetables?”

My mouth opened and closed a few times. Grace blinked.

“They’re… fine?” I offered.

Frank beamed. “Good man. A town can’t run without a good beet crop. Everyone says so.”

Betty chimed in, smiling wide. “Yes, everyone says so.”

Grace and I looked at each other for a few seconds, utter bewilderment and confusion upon our faces.

“Well, I guess we’d best be on our way. Is there uh, a place to stay? Like a motel or something.”

Before realising the mistake I had just made, Betty was already spouting off about the town history and how there used not to be a hotel, but now there is, and who owns it. In that verbal diarrhea, we did manage to hear the name.

“…**Friendly Pines Motel**,” I repeated slowly, as if saying it aloud would help it make sense.

“Yes! That’s the one,” Betty said, nodding like she’d just handed us the map to paradise. “Very nice. Can’t miss it. Just down Main Street, past the church, turn left at the bank, you’ll see the sign, bright green, says ‘Friendly Pines’ in big, cheerful letters. Don’t worry, dear, you’ll be fine.”

“Great, thanks, Betty.” Grace said, trying to push me out the door.

“Grace, we didn’t pay,” I reminded her, tugging gently on her sleeve.

Betty waved a hand dismissively, a wide, confident smile on her face. “Oh, don’t you worry about that, dear. Coffees on the house. Happens all the time for visitors; some of them never even bring coins. Not that you’d notice.” She gave a little laugh, but it was the kind of laugh that made it feel like she genuinely didn’t see the need for any explanation.

Quickly leaving before we could be roped back into another conversation, we started to walk down the road towards the motel.

“How are we even going to pay for this?” Grace wondered, “I mean, it’s not like we carry cash, and I doubt our credit cards would even work.”

“I was just thinking the same thing. I guess we could always try with our cards and hope for the best.” I offered up.

We walked in silence for a few steps; the town’s neat little streets were lined with brick and timber buildings that seemed almost self-conscious about the space they occupied. Each storefront was meticulously kept, with paint that shone just enough to suggest pride without drawing too much attention. The lampposts were perfectly spaced, the sidewalks swept clean, and yet the precision made everything feel a little unnatural.

Grace’s gaze drifted to the waterfront on our right, the sunlight glinting off the water in a way that made the small bay look almost like a hidden gem, tucked just out of sight. “I didn’t even know this was here,” she murmured, her voice quiet, almost hesitant. “My parents never mentioned it.”

I squinted against the glare, the waves catching the light in fleeting patterns. “Yeah… It’s like the town hides itself until it wants to be seen,” I said, feeling a shiver contrasting with the afternoon sun.

She frowned, tilting her head, as if trying to make sense of the shapes and lines of the streets. “Almost as if it’s trying to condense itself as much as possible, but parts keep spilling out”.

We walked in silence the rest of the way to the motel, passing countless people that seemed too many for the size of the town. The sidewalks were crowded with small conversations: a man leaning too close to a woman as he told a story with exaggerated hand movements; a pair of teenagers laughing a fraction too loud at something unfunny; an old lady sweeping her porch in slow, deliberate strokes, nodding at every passerby as if acknowledging them for an invisible roll call.

The Friendly Pines Motel loomed ahead, its sign in cheery green letters glowing faintly even in the daylight. The exterior was modest, almost shy, but when we stepped through the glass doors, the lobby stretched out before us like it belonged to a completely different building.

Two curved grand staircases swept out from either side of the front desk, their red-carpeted steps climbing upward in perfect symmetry before vanishing around opposite corners. Polished wooden banisters gleamed under the warm light of chandeliers, which swung just slightly, though there was no breeze.

The air smelled faintly of pine and lemon polish. A grandfather clock ticked steadily in the corner, its pendulum swinging a half-beat slower than seemed natural.

Grace stopped short. “This is… not what I expected.”

“WELCOME!” a booming voice rang out from the top of the grand staircase, startling both of us.

We looked up to see a man standing there, striking a pose as though the entire lobby were his stage. He was dressed head to toe in elaborate attire: a deep burgundy tailcoat with gold trim, a towering black top hat perched at a jaunty angle, and a long black cane tipped with a silver wolf’s head. His handlebar moustache was so extravagantly curled it seemed to defy gravity.

Beside him stood a woman, equally theatrical in style, her sequined dress glittering under the chandelier light as if she’d stepped straight out of a 1920s burlesque reel. A feathered headpiece curved upward from her hair, but her face was locked into a scowl of annoyance and hate targeted towards us.

We watched in stunned silence as the man hooked his cane on the railing and, with surprising grace, slid down the banister in a single sweeping motion. The woman followed at his side, descending the staircase with a slinky, deliberate sway.

They landed before us with a flourish.

“Ah, newcomers!” the man announced, sweeping his hat from his head and bowing low, his moustache twitching with the motion. “Welcome, welcome to our fine establishment! I am…” He paused dramatically; cane raised to the ceiling as though summoning lightning. “…Mr. Alastair DuPont, owner and humble servant to all who seek rest beneath the Friendly Pines!”

He struck a pose. For a moment, the air seemed to thrum, and we thought we heard what sounded like a smattering of applause and cheers, but from nowhere in particular.

“And this young thing,” he continued, swooping an arm toward his companion, “is my beautiful wife, Everlyn.”

He bent down with exaggerated gallantry, kissing her hand before springing back upright with theatrical speed. Everlyn, maintaining her poise, slowly reached into her clutch and produced a baby wipe. She wiped hard at the exact spot where his lips had touched, expression unchanged, then discarded the wipe neatly into a handbag without breaking eye contact with us.

“Pleasure.” She said with a tone that just oozed venom and contempt, though Mr DuPont didn’t seem to mind. Grace and I exchanged glances. Their contrast extended to more than just their attitudes. Her accent, thick and Australian, while DuPont spoke with a mock American accent, like a prototype Transatlantic accent.  The whole performance felt rehearsed, like we'd walked into the middle of a play that had been running for decades. ""We, uh, we'd like a room,"" I managed, my voice cracking slightly.  ""Of course, of course!"" Mr DuPont exclaimed, spinning his cane like a baton before catching it with a flourish. “We shall prepare for you our finest room. Come,” and he immediately started speed walking in the opposite direction, back up the stairs. We tried to follow behind him, but we struggled to keep up with him through all the twists and turns of the motel. Mr DuPont moved with impossible speed, his coat tails billowing behind him as he navigated the maze-like interior with the confidence of someone who'd walked these paths for decades. “Keep up, keep up!"" he called over his shoulder, his voice echoing off the walls.

Finally, Mr DuPont stopped in front of a door marked with a brass plaque that simply read ""The Suite."" He produced an elaborate skeleton key from his waistcoat and turned it with a ceremonial flourish. “Your palace awaits!"" he announced, throwing the door open with a dramatic sweep of his arm.

 “Palace” was a massive overstatement. The room had a double bed that had a noticeable sag in the middle, along with a single nightstand that looked straight out of the 50s. There was a small armchair wedged awkwardly in the narrow gap between the bed and the wall. The wallpaper was a faded floral pattern, peeling at the corners where moisture had crept in over the years. A thin brown carpet covered the floor, worn through to the backing in a path from the door to the bed. Heavy curtains covered the single window.

“This is….” I started to say before being interrupted by, “I know, it’s a lot to take in.” Mr DuPont said, beaming with pride. “The best part is, it’s only $100 a night!” Grace gave me a quick look before asking, “Is there a possibility we could get two single beds in here?”

DuPont looked at us very blankly and said, “No,” before quickly getting back in character. “Well, I’ll leave you two to settle in, I’ll just take your card, and I’ll charge you after your stay comes to an end.”

That worked out conveniently for us.

Grace sat heavily on the sagging bed, which creaked ominously under her weight. She pulled her hair free from its tie, letting it fall around her face as she rubbed her temples ""Marc, this is so fucked.""

""I know."" I slumped into the armchair, which was even more uncomfortable than it looked. The springs had given up years ago. ""How do we get back?""

Grace was quiet for a long time, staring out the window at the timeless street scene below. ""What if we can't get back? What if this is just... our life now?""

“I doubt it’s that dire, Grace. I’m sure everything will be fine.” I was bluffing. I just wanted to say something that would make us both feel better.

""Since we're in ‘92, wanna try finding your parents?"" I suggested, mostly to fill the silence.

Grace shifted uncomfortably. ""I don't know. They always got weird when I brought up Hollowbend. Never wanted to talk about it."" She paused. ""But I guess it would be interesting to see what they were like back then.""

She yawned and looked at the single bed. ""So... how are we handling sleeping arrangements?""

I glanced at the uncomfortable armchair. ""I'll take the chair. I've slept in worse places.""

""Don't be ridiculous. We're both adults. We can share a bed without making it weird.""

""If you're sure...""

""I'm sure. Besides,"" she said, settling onto one side of the bed, ""if we're stuck in 1992 forever, we might as well get comfortable.""

I took the other side, both of us staying fully clothed and keeping to our respective edges of the sagging mattress.",1,1759386639.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1nvwbfg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvwbfg,"42M [M4F] Los Angeles/Westside – Childfree, liberal, beach & movie fan with pets looking for something real","42M here in Los Angeles, and honestly, it’s been tough finding someone special who’s also happily childfree. I’m liberal, atheist, love animals (I’ve got a sweet dog named Leia and a goofy cat named Maximus), and I’d like to meet someone who shares the same outlook on a kid-free life. I’ve got a nice rent-controlled apartment on the Westside, enjoy hitting the beach, checking out new (and favorite) food spots and coffee shops, and winding down with movies, TV, or a good book.

I’m a Lakers and Star Wars fan, into sneakers and film, but you don’t have to be — I just like sharing passions and learning about new ones. Ideally, I’m hoping to meet someone in their 30s–40s, but a little outside that range works too if the connection feels right. If you’re childfree, down for some laughs, and like the idea of spontaneous late night Koreatown coffee runs, various Asian/pizza/etc. dinner plans, or at home movie nights, I’d love to hear from you!",7,1759386610.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

1nvw8cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OctopiLauncher/comments/1nvw8cg/octopi_feedback/,Octopi Feedback,"I've been using it for a bit and I did make a previous post with some initial feedback but I've been digging deeper into the drawer and have some feedback for that.

Specifically I am trying to reproduce what I could do with tabs in Nova's drawer. Tags can do this mostly which is great. However the one missing thing is being unable to assign tags to folders, and move them out of All into a tag like you can with individual icons. If you could do this I could reproduce my app organization completely.

Also I wanted to reiterate a piece of earlier feedback because it's seemed to me to be something that was a small oversight which hopefully would be easy to resolve. So maybe the dev did not notice it in my feedback or it has slipped his mind (I can sympathize being a dev myself).

The new Terminal app in Android 16 does not show up in Octopi. Not in the drawer, not in the app search, nothing. Very weird since I have not seen this happening in any other launcher. Not sure what is different about this particular app, except that it is new to Android 16 and is built-in. It would be nice to see this fixed.

I did get enough Google Rewards to buy that coffee. Enjoy! I'll probably throw the full cost Pro purchase your way too once I build up enough Rewards but that will take a little while...",3,1759386286.0,OctopiLauncher,2,1.0,False

We were chatting, vibed over films and self-care, he offered a coffee date at one point - but neither of us confirmed on the day. On the day I got anxious and assumed he wasn’t keen, so I didn’t go. He turned up. He was fine and we talked after with plans to reschedule. We fell off a bit, and by the time I messaged again after finishing an assignment, he’d unmatched.

I left it alone… but the thing is, I genuinely liked our dynamic. And now months later, I’ve circled back to the thought: what if that was just bad timing? He’s in med school final year, I’m in law school first year so I was stressed af at the beginning - both busy, probably nervous.

He’s not on the apps anymore. I haven’t reached out. But I could message him on Facebook (we quit a few mutuals), and just say something direct but low-pressure, like:

“Hey, I know we spoke earlier this year and it kinda fizzled. Totally random, but I feel like we got our wires crossed - if you’re ever still curious about that coffee, I’d be down now.”

Would that come across as creepy or desperate? Or is it actually fine in 2025 to shoot your shot like that? I’m not expecting magic honestly, just curious if people think this is acceptable or if I’m romanticising the whole thing and should step back.

(And yes, I’m okay with him saying no. I just don’t want to seem like a weirdo for even trying. And I reckon my friends wouldn’t be that objective tbh.)",1,1759386141.0,Bumble,6,1.0,False

The downside is that this older model doesn’t have an auto-off switch like the newer ones, so I have to remember to turn it off myself. But tbh, that feels like a small tradeoff for a machine that just won’t quit.
