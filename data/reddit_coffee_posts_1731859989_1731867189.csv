We hit it off straight away, conversation flowed easy and we ended up staying up together until 2am the first night we met.

We met up 6 times after that, for coffees, at a game, a comedy show, I cooked dinner.

We had agreed to take things slow physically but we would end up making out or making out and cuddling on a couch.

Anyway the last date was at her place, she cooked dinner. Afterwards we were making out and cuddling on her couch. I made a slight move to escalate things and she declined. She said a few minutes afterwards that she isn’t a prude.

I felt terrible that me initiating more contact made her feel this way. She was 4 weeks out of a long term relationship. 

We continued to talk and kiss that night but she sent me home relatively early. The next day after a few text exchanges she text me saying she didn’t feel we are a match for what she’s looking for right now and wished me the best.

I’m gutted. I’d love to see her again and take things slowly and see where it goes but I have to respect her wishes now and give her space. I plan on working on myself for a while.

Just wondering women out there, have you ever called things off early and given a guy another chance later on?

Long story short, I met this girl at a summer job this year. She just moved here from another state, we have similar interests. And so I developed feelings, we met up for coffee a week later and then spent 4 months talking on instagram. A lot of planning to hang out on my end.

Now a couple things of note - after a month of talking, she posts on her story hanging out with a guy and then i noticed i was hidden from seeing her stories a couple days later. And in general, she would reply sometimes late to me and just never made extra efforts to meet up with me. Or match my efforts. So not good looks :/

We finally met up a couple weeks ago. I was excited because I made plans for a movie and then she changed it so we go where she works instead - a dine in theater. It was nice, we saw a rom-com. We looked nice and I was happy to see her again.

Now we've talked about other plans as well and she's always been down for it. Including a rooftop movie. I felt it was a good time to ask about her facebook, and so she added me today and thats where it seemed more clear to me that yeah, she's still with this guy. Engaged and all.

But why didnt she ever tell me? Why did she agree to hang out with me at a dine-in theater? We could've made other plans. And to be clear, she's just a friend that i have feelings for. We have both done nothing wrong. Its not like i met her at a dating site and being together is the expectation.

Im just sad, i had my hopes up cause i really liked her. We still have plans to meet up, like this week she might take pictures of me for some professional headshots. We had to cancel last week. But after that, i might have to really think about it :/",1,1731866548.0,dating,1,1.0,False

This place has been fabulous, and for the year I've been here, I've told everyone that you'd have to pluck this place out of my cold, dead hands. This place has been my first post-divorce place, and it was the perfect sanctuary to start fresh. The only reason I may be moving is due to work & to be closer to personal community/social group. The landlady is AMAZING, she's like the big sister I never had. She lives about an hour or so away with her elderly mother, and she's always responsive to and receptive to any needs that have arisen during my time here. However, there have been very few issues or problems. Pretty much everyone in the building is a working professional, so no crazy ragers or such that you need to worry about. The building is pet-friendly, even to often restricted breeds like pitbulls, which won my heart over, even though I don't have a pittie of my own, I just happen to love pitties. I'm also willing to leave behind miscellaneous furniture, such as an L-shaped desk, queen bed-frame, custom closet shelving that I built, tall shelf with numerous shelves and drawers, dining table, and bar stool, if you'd like. 

I have flexibility in terms of timeline. I'm currently month-to-month, and would need to provide 60 days of notice. So, if you're interested, I'm more than happy to work with any timeline you may have. Feel free to message me if you're interested in learning more.  ",4,1731866363.0,baltimore,0,1.0,False

Since then I've only had it accidentally a few times. I am extremely intestinally sensitive to chocolate (even vegan), and have been kept up all night from eating a chocolate muffin too late. Not sure if that's related, but anyways... The few times I've had caffeine since, I've had sever anxiety symptoms (once asked my roommate to take me to the hospital after having some cream soda I didn't realize had caffeine), but I can't tell if they were from realizing what happened or if I have an actual physical issue with caffeine.

My question is...has anybody gone on nearly as long a hiatus and reintroduced it? Has anybody found there's a test to determine if caffeine is actually dangerous for your heart? I have cardiophobia and I stopped drinking caffeine around the same time I stopped consuming marijuana for the same reason - heart rate was too high and freaked me out.

I am now working a job that starts ridiculously early, and after years of working remotely, this is causing serious stress on my sleep and ability to be awake. I have also been wanting to be able to consume a normal amount of tea or coffee so as to not insult hosts when I travel in countries where such a thing is given to guests as a custom (I have said no many times and felt I was missing out and creating a bit of a barrier).

So, what do you guys think?

1gtjcno,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1gtjcno/minrathous_v_treviso_a_discussion/,Minrathous v Treviso: a discussion,"From a storytelling standpoint, including the quests that follow, companion reactions, etc., do you prefer to save M or T?

I’ve done both now: saved M in my first playthrough as a Shadow Dragon and now im a Crow who saved T. And in my opinion, I find saving T to be more… fulfilling? Also interesting? 

First point is one I’ve commonly seen and share: M has long been known to be very, very powerful. With a multitude of mages in high-positions, the Shadow Dragons, and just defense systems built in (e.g. the lasers from the palace), M is more fortified and would seem better able to fend off a dragon attack, blighted or not. T on the other hand, is mostly civilians. There is no army, no magical defenses— all the city has is the Crows. And they’re powerful assassins, sure, but that’s ALL they have: no magical gadgets, etc. Based on this, I think it made more sense to save T because they really needed the help.

Of course we cannot forget the Venatori threat. Yes, this presence hindered M in the attack, but wouldn’t the Antaam do something similar for T? 

Moving on to some storytelling involving the Venatori: I find it much more interesting (narratively) for the Venatori to seize power in M while the dragon attacked rather than T being blighted. Returning and seeing the public executions, the little quests involving the remaining Shadow Dragons and what’s been happening to them, Viper being blighted… it all just feels more real? And a huge consequence for your actions. I found the little quests around the aftermath of saving T to be much more fulfilling and heart aching than choosing M— there’s even a small little moment where you can go to the wall of light and find Viper there. He talks to you and lets you light 3 of the spheres in memory of the fallen. It’s sweet, it’s sad, and having Neve with you also makes it feel more real.

 Speaking of Neve, let’s move onto some character differences. Personally, I think saving T has made Neve’s personal quests more intriguing. Now it’s not just stopping Aelia and protecting Dock Town, it’s her desperately clawing against Aelia, Venatori now being in control and executing her friends/allies/innocents, the Shadow Dragons torn apart, part of the city blighted…the list goes on. Her frustration, I feel, is more palpable. The stakes keep getting higher and higher and, as she commonly says, “everything is slipping through my fingers.” 

As someone who romances Neve, I think this choice is also well-structured. Neve is already well guarded, depending on her self over others: she’s used to going it alone, to losing the few people she once counted on, and it used to being stabbed in the back/let down. So, building up a tentative friendship which adds in flirting and the two maybe catching some feels? Only for Rook to choose T over M and thus let Neve down (as she EXPECTS of people)…it’s a blow. It’s her “cynicism being proven right” as Aelia eventually says (not verbatim). And her interactions reflect this: she takes a step back for awhile, doesn’t engage in small-talk with Rook, is a bit colder. The game forces you to earn her trust back and I think that’s more realistic— people hurt people, we let each other down. It especially hurts when it’s someone you’ve grown to care for and it’s real and understandable to distance yourself until the other person (if they even do) finds a way to earn your trust again. That’s what happens with Neve— you are not locked out of her romance/friendship, you simply have to re-earn her trust. And I like that a lot. In some ways, I think it even makes for a stronger bond rather than Rook simply doing everything “right” for Neve.

 Now for Lucanis. Another reason I enjoy saving T or M is that you get Lucanis’ quest “Inner Demons” which explores his mental space, specifically in regards to being an abomination. We get an inside look at how he views himself, how he thinks others view him, his fears…and we get to see more of Spite. We get to witness the two growing together rather than always being at each others throats, which we see later in the game after the quest when Rook goes out for coffee with Lucanis and Spite. We get to subtly see changes in Spite, not just Lucanis, because we know from the game (and aspects such as Solas’ memories) that spirits can be changed/altered: Solas went from Wisdom to Pride, and it seems that Spite might be able to shift to something better as well (I’ve seen clips of endgame Lucanis and Solas banter where Solas calls Spite a spirit of “determination” so perhaps this is further evidence of Spite changing).   

If you save M, you miss out on this quest. I feel that is a whole character arc just cut away, which is another reason I prefer saving T over M.

I think I had some more ideas/points, but my thoughts escape me. This is the gist of it though. ",2,1731866207.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,1,1.0,False

This was my first ever Attempt At auto crossing, no track experiencing, no professional training no seat time nothing, Just been driving for \~5 years. I went with a few friends one whom had done it before, and the results were interesting, I was in Rungroup 3 (Car Number 69) And each participate got 4 Runs, it was two laps around a pretty simple track, the following details my 4 Runs:

1 My first attempt was initialized by accident they had a grid and running groups and I had pulled forward to get one of my passengers a helmet than circle back but then they had me run ahead of where I was supposed to be so I was tossed on the spot with my other two passengers barely making it to my car in-time for my first lap, we made it and it wasn't a bad run, First half was a lil shaky the traction control didn't really help with slide outs that much it just got in my way beeped at me, So halfway thru I disabled VSC and the rest of that run was very smooth, I Didn't hit any cones my final lap time was 56.945 

Sadly I didn't get any Footage for this first run

2 Second lap was an unmitigated complete total disaster lol, The lap started with My passenger and I agreeing he would turn off VSC after i Launched, I for some reason decided to just turn it off without telling him and figured i could manage on my own, then when the lap started He went to reach for the VSC and a panicked and swept my hand to stop him, in the process I must have Slapped the shifter Into Low because the entire reminder of the run I was just revving the ever-living shit out of the 3UZ and with no VSC  and High reving first gear I ended up spinning out when I entered the cones the wrong order out of pure frustration, Thankfully the LS430s God tier brakes were able to save my ass and I stopped it inches from smashing into the curb. All in all there were about 7 DNQs in the span of 30 seconds  


For your Viewing Pleasure/Horror This run was Filmed: [https://youtu.be/khWDhLXJSAM?si=P\_YZcOR8vGiHT031](https://youtu.be/khWDhLXJSAM?si=P_YZcOR8vGiHT031)

  
3 Run Three was more a combination of run two and run 1 I had VSC off and I made my turns without issue I was better focused until the start of the 2nd lap It worked great until I as seen in run 2 footage I again entered the cones in the wrong order and got a DNQ

Sadly No one to record this run either

4 By Run four I was far more conservative with my throttle and Was concerned with my tires surviving the highway trip home, so I took it easy on this one Still VSC off and Pulled off a pretty good time around 52-53 seconds, Ill find the exact time when I pull everything from my car later today, Didnt hit any cones, and By this point i knew the track pretty well This run was recorded and from Two Different POVs, One by someone on Cone duty and another out on the Hill:

All in all I definitely would recommend Going to one of these if you are a car enthusiast and want to know how your car will really handle under certain conditions, and if not that than Did I mention it was a Shit ton of fun? Hell the 430 all things considered Isn't the worst Auto-crossing car you could try, I Even with this being my first time, and my sub par, unideal times I managed to beat some hideous BMW Egg-looking Crossover coupesuv thing, and a Lincoln LS. I imagine with some more skill practice and refinement I could get my times down into the 40s Territory. If not for the fun of actually driving yourself it is a lot of fun to Ride along as a passenger With other peoples cars Or even to sit and watch people try laps its a hell of a lot safer and entertaining than your average cars and coffee sort of thing and you actually get to watch some drivers with some skill Drive these cars rather than have them sit around looking pretty.

In this post, I’ll lay out why I think friendship is very important and underinvested in by many young adults.  Then I’ll lay out the strategies that I tried to make friend around Boston.  My project in building a strong network of friendship is far from finished.  That said, I wanted to share my journey and the research I did on best practices for making friends and social groups existing in the area, in case any young adults living here or elsewhere may find this content useful.

I moved to Boston two years ago from NYC.   Shortly after moving to Boston, I made a close friend. My cousin introduced us and I met him a few weeks after moving to the city.  We had many common interests (e.g. hiking, social issues, self-help) and began to hang out almost every week. 

Besides my close friend, I had a cousin in the city and two friends from college.   I didn’t want my social life to be dependent on just a few people who might move away.  After a few months of living here, I began an earnest effort to expand my local circle of friends.

# Part One: Motivation and Approach

**Importance of friendship**

I believe there is abundant evidence of the importance of a good social life for mental health.  In May 2023, the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy [released an Advisory](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf) calling attention to the public health crisis of loneliness, highlighting how loneliness is bad for physical and mental health: “Loneliness is far more than just a bad feeling — it harms both individual and societal health. It is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and premature death. The mortality impact of being socially disconnected is similar to that caused by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.”  Murthy also explained that loneliness is prevalent and on the rise: “Changes in key indicators, including individual social participation, demographics, community involvement, and use of technology over time, suggest both overall societal declines in social connection and that, currently, a significant portion of Americans lack adequate social connection.”

While strong family relationships are key components of healthy social lives of many people, so are friendships.  On [an episode of Mark Manson’s podcast](https://markmanson.net/podcast/sonja-lyubomirsky), Sonja Lyubomirsky, the author of the book “The How of Happiness: A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want” stated that she believed friendship to be even more important than marriage for long run happiness.  [Harvard’s famous long running study on happiness](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/) found that the quality of a person’s relationships was the number one predictor of not just their happiness but also their long run physical health.  In the context of the study, relationships did not just mean immediate family.  Relationships also included friendships. 

**Why many young adults have inadequate social lives**

Why do so many of us struggle with loneliness?   Let me first establish why I believe we have gotten to a place as a society such that if no disciplined action is taken by an individual, they stand a good chance of becoming socially undernourished.  Then I will explain why I think people infrequently take the action needed to remedy their isolation.

I believe there is an interesting parallel between America’s loneliness crisis and the nation’s health crisis.  I suspect that technology destroyed the health of countless Americans with metabolic diseases brought on by the [invention and proliferation of ultraprocessed foods](https://www.raweggstack.com/p/rfk-jr-special-what-is-ultra-processed).  In the 1950s and before, very few Americans were overweight.  If one just lived a normal lifestyle (likely getting around more on foot and less by powered vehicle) and ate what was sold at stores, one was unlikely to become overweight and suffer from resultant illnesses.  Today, ¾ of Americans are overweight or obese.  Nowadays, one has to apply discipline to eat healthier options than what lines most of the grocery store and one has to go out of their way to exercise. 

Likewise with socializing, even a decade ago people were far less lonely.  After 2013, the time Americans spent with their friends dropped precipitously. What happened? According to the Australian writer Joseph Friedman, the decrease can be explained by the rise of smartphones, tablets, high-speed internet and affordable laptops. [Friedman says](https://lsj.com.au/articles/surviving-alone-why-loneliness-is-killing-us/): “30 years ago, we still crowded around the television with our tribe. Today, we stream alone, hunched in a corner of the house watching TV on a phone or a laptop, while our partners and children do the same in their corners, alone.”   Nowadays if you don’t put a conscious effort to socialize it’s all too easy to spend your free time with consuming our modern form of electronic entertainment that enables individuals to more readily entertain themselves alone.  Electronic entertainment is much more comfortable mentally than joining groups, trying to strike up conversations with people, inviting people to hang out and dealing with the rejection and failure that often comes with these actions.

People have accepted that disciplined effort is needed to maintain physical health through nutrition and exercise.  Many people put effort into these areas of their lives.  Why is it that, at least it seems to me, so many people fail to put much effort into improving their social lives?   I will group the reasons I see into two categories.  First, I think many people assume they have little control over their social lives.  Second, I think many people don’t value socializing as much as they should, making it hard for them to motivate themselves to fix their deficits. 

Many people believe that our social lives are out of our hands.  They think that friendships are made by chance and there is little we can do to improve our social lives.  In fact, I’ve heard that this belief is correlated with a higher likelihood of being lonely later in life.  In contrast, people who believe that an active effort is required to build and maintain relationships tend to have better friendships in the long run.

I think many people just don’t value socializing enough for various reasons. I am speaking from my own experience, as I don’t have any studies supporting the following claims.  I think parents can inculcate bad values.  I believe that my parents, despite their many great qualities, did that with my siblings and I.  Growing up, I heard from my parents that friends come and go, while family is here to stay.  My father would comment that my more social younger brother was always hanging out with friends in his free time, when he should really spend more time with family, academics, or intellectual pursuits like reading.   

Family members, acquaintances and I have been stricken with workaholism, where we fill up most of our time with academic or career work.  We leave little time to maintain, let alone improve our social lives.  Even for people who only value their careers and do not care about their happiness, I think this is often counterproductive.  I’ve seen people become depressed to the point of becoming dysfunctional while working long hours and not socializing much.  While there are other factors, in the cases I recall, I have to think that their social deprivation is the main cause of their mental troubles. 

Finally, I find many people make the excuse that they are introverted and therefore do not need to socialize much.  They claim that their batteries get drained from socializing and they need a lot of alone time.  I often find these people less happy than their more social peers and I have to wonder whether it’s not due to insufficient socializing.  [There’s evidence](https://carleton.ca/happinesslab/should-introverts-act-more-extraverted/#:~:text=That%20is%2C%20when%20acting%20extraverted,even%20introverts%20enjoy%20acting%20extraverted.) that when people who claim to be introverts act more extraverted, they feel happier.  I often suspect a lot of these “introverted” people have had stressful experiences mingling at group events and assume that their discomfort means they are introverted.  I’d be curious to learn how they feel after the events.  I often feel stressed and nervous during social events, but energized and connected afterwards.   Just because I am stressed during the event does not mean that I need more alone time. Also, if you spend most of your free time for years in isolation, your social muscles will atrophy and social interaction with strangers will become more stressful. 

In any case, if someone’s social life is significantly lacking, I believe it’s worth a concerted effort to improve this area.  In the remainder of the post, I’ll lay out the strategies I employed to do this during my time in Boston.

**My approach to making friends**

Before I delve into the various strategies I employed, I wanted to describe my overall approach to making friends and where the approach came from.

Early in my time in Boston I listened to an episode of the [Savvy Psychologist podcast titled](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/204-how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult/id803978236?i=1000414904670)  “How To Make Friends as an Adult”.  In the episode, psychologist Ellen Hendriksen encourages adults to find groups that are meaningful and regularly attend them.  Dr. Hendriksen points out that attending groups is not enough.  Many of her clients would join groups but act as wallflowers, hardly interacting with group members.  You need to approach people and start conversations.  Hendriksen emphasized that it likely doesn’t matter much what you say.  You just need to push yourself to say a few things during each group meeting.  After attending many meetings with a group and seeing some of the same faces each week, assess whether you seem to be hitting it off with specific group members.  Then invite them to hang out outside of the group.  The first activity should be small (e.g. another group activity or grabbing coffee), but you can build up from there.

In addition to the podcast, another item that shaped my friend making approach was friend coaching.  Somewhere I heard of this profession.  With my enthusiasm for personal development and willingness and privilege to fund that activity, I became interested in working with a friend coach.  A Google search seemed to return only a few professionals that marketed themselves as such coaches in the country.  I [hired one for $100/hour](https://www.coachedliving.com/) (note the rate may have changed).   I had a number of sessions with her and I learned her approach to making friends.  Her approach was similar to Hendriksen’s – she encouraged me to join groups and try to eventually hang out with promising members outside of the group.  However, she specified some additional best practices.  She encouraged me to write down the qualities that I would like to see in a friend.  I should consider early interactions and hangouts with a potential friend as interviews.  If a friend candidate failed to score well enough on my criteria, I would stop pursuing friendship with them.  I know this may sound cold and calculated, but it strikes me as a helpful lens to prioritize which candidates to invest time in.

I wrote down the following as my criteria that I would like to see:

* Shares interest in talking about some of the things that I like to discuss:
   * Social issues (e.g. housing crisis, health crisis, loneliness crisis, dysfunctional higher ed, etc.)
   * Startups
   * Stories from our lives (especially if the stories involve talking about other people)
   * Intellectual conversation around many nonfiction topics (especially social science and psychology)
   * Best practices (e.g. health, careers, dating, etc.)
* Shares interest in activities that I enjoy
   * Hiking
   * Long walk around the city
   * Biking
   * Trying different restaurants (who doesn’t like this?)
* Has a compatible sense of humor
* Takes interest in my life (and I take interest in theirs)
* Responds to messages in a timely manner (it’s okay to take a few days to respond occasionally, but no ghosting)
* Doesn’t cancel plans often

Some may say that making friends is generally common sense and internalizing the best practices in this section is not useful.  Indeed, for many people the mechanics of making friends may be intuitive.  However, for others I suspect they may benefit from a little guidance.   They may have had their friend making skills atrophy from years of inactivity or never develop in our age of great isolation. 

# Part Two: Friend Making Groups & Activities

**Bumble BFF**

When I first moved to Boston, before I tried to immerse myself in groups, I dabbled with Bumble BFF for a few months, the friend making app produced by its namesake company best known for its dating app (at the time the app was a feature within the dating app).  The app worked just like a dating app.  You could apply filters and then swipe through the profiles that met your conditions.  The app would only let me see male profiles, which was frustrating as I feel that I am often prefer talking to women.  Most of the profiles I found were of gay men.  This concerned me as I am straight and not interested in anything beyond platonic friendship with a guy.   I met up with \~5 guys from the app, two of whom were straight.  Ultimately, I did not feel that I hit it off with any of them except for one guy.  We seemed to have a very compatible sense of humor.   I invited him to several activities – a walk, then a local hike, then my birthday party.  I thought we had potential, but he began to decline all of my invites saying that he was busy during the times I offered and never reciprocated his own invites.  I gave up after he declined 2-3 invites in a row.  As you’ll see this was all too common of a pattern among the people who I met in Boston who I thought had potential as friends.  I would feel that I may have struck gold with them, only to find them not reciprocate.  

**Groups based on shared interests**

Below, I’ll list the groups that I have found in my research, elaborating about some of them.

# Running groups

My Greater Boston native therapist described Boston as a “running city”.  According to her, running clubs are a notable part of the city’s culture. This struck me as true based on the wealth of groups that seemed to pop up in my Google searches.  

* Midnight Runners – They have a long run on Sunday mornings and a “bootcamp” run every Tuesday at 7. I mostly do bootcamp runs. While this running club provides a great workout, I think the bootcamp runs accommodate a range of paces because every mile you stop to do bodyweight exercises, allowing slower runners to catch up. They play pop/EDM during the runs, which I often enjoy. A downside of the music is that it’s harder to make conversation with people. Some people stay at a bar afterwards, so there is a less encumbered opportunity to socialize then. I do find a lot of people come with their existing friends and don’t strike me as that open to making new friends.
* Marathon Sports Running Club
* Founders Running Club – I think this one is intended for startup founders and related tech professionals. As a product manager interested in startups, I should definitely check this out.
* Tracksmith – Compared to the other groups listed here, I’ve heard the level of competition is much higher in this group
* TMIRCE – I went to one of their Sunday long runs starting in Soldier Field park. I don’t have a car, so I left my phone (with attached phone wallet) foolishly in a bag covered by clothing. When I got back my debit card and drivers license of stolen. Thankfully they left my phone. I saw a $1000 charge on my debit card from the Apple store that was caught by a fraud algorithm. Getting new cards was a hassle, but I learned a lesson from the experience 🙂.
* Many more

# Outing clubs

Hiking is my number one hobby.   I thought I’d apply the common wisdom of trying to do something you enjoy with other people.  Below are what I think are the two leading outing groups for young adults in Greater Boston.  At least for hiking, both experience an imbalance of trip postings relative to the demand for trips, so trips often become waitlisted fast.

* AMC Boston Chapter 20s & 30s group – Starting last year I began training to be a hike leader in this group.  I found friends were very flakey about hikes, canceling last minute.  I figured if could become an AMC leader, given that trips always seem to get wait listed, I would have no trouble finding people to hike with.  I did a two-day wilderness first aid class, two-day leadership training, and co-lead four hikes in the White Mountains last summer.  I have not had any trouble getting people to sign up for my hikes. 
* MIT Outing Club – I was surprised to learn this group is open to the public.  The group does not seem to have as many trips as the AMC group has.  Similar to the AMC 20s and 30s group, the trips fill up very fast

# Sports leagues

For guys especially, I’ve heard that joining sports leagues can be a great way to make friends.  While women can bond over just face to face conversation, men often require an activity with a shared purpose to connect[.  In Australia they even invented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_shed) an activity to facilitate this environment conducive to male bonding – groups organized to build sheds.  They called them “men’s sheds”.  I digress. 

* BUDA Ultimate Frisbee – Every summer and sometimes in other seasons, the group puts on a “learning league” for folks new to the sport to learn the basics.  I did the summer 2023 learning league.  Overall, the experience was positive.  I found almost no one that I felt shared my conversation topic interests.  Ultimate frisbee is supposed to be a very social sport. I heard from someone in the learning league who had done ultimate frisbee in the past that he was surprised that the group had not had an after practice visit to a bar during the first 6 weeks of the 8-week program.  Maybe people were just less interested or oriented toward socializing as our culture was recovering from the covid lockdowns?   Eventually we did have drinks/dinner after practice. 
* Stinky Socks Hockey – I hate the name of this organization. I played hockey in middle school and did intramurals, so I thought I’d give this a try.  Stinky Socks allows you to easily sign up for drop-in games at different skill levels. I spent close to $1000 and made several visits to stores to get a full set of hockey gear.   I attended a few drop-in classes with the lowest skill level and found the competition to be high.  Some of the group members agreed that people tended to play at lower skill levels.  This is frustrating because it makes the experience less pleasant for less skilled players.  I read online how hockey has a very high rate of injuries such as concussions.  I am physically risk averse, so I began to really question my choice of playing.  Then during a game, a player fell and lay on the ice for 20 minutes while gameplay paused until EMS took him out on a stretcher.  The players speculated that he had broken his leg.  I never returned.   My large bag of hockey gear has been sitting in my apartment for over a year since then.
* VOLO Sports
   * I’ve heard a lot of good things about Volo sports for making friends.  For various reasons I have not tried them
   * Leagues offered
      * Volleyball
      * Basketball
      * Soccer
      * Pickleball
      * Kickball
      * Dodgeball
      * Bowling
      * And more

# Political advocacy groups

I am interested in fixing social issues and I think in many cases policy can be a key part of the answer.  Below I mainly listed groups that I have been involved in or interested in joining, but of course there are many more.  Similar to sports leagues, these groups unite members around a strong shared purpose.   I suspect the majority of advocacy groups are the most active during election season, asking members to make calls or knock on doors to advertise preferred candidates.  I’ve done door knocking a number of times and it’s certainly stressful.  But I think it’s healthy rejection therapy.  

Housing, Transit, and Cycling - All around the US, older, homeowning Americans have way more influence on local government.  This is largely due to younger adults failing to do their civic duty and vote in local and state elections, while older adults vote at a high rate.  As a result of the outsized influence of the homeowner class, the housing, transit, and cycling policies that most cities and states pursue favors the interests of this group.  You can read more about this phenomenon in my previous post: [https://substack.com/home/post/p-150804407](https://substack.com/home/post/p-150804407)

   * A Better Cambridge
* Transit
   * TransitMatters
* Cycling
   * MassBike
* Republican Party
   * Massachusetts Young Republicans
* Democratic Party
   * Young Democrats of Massachusetts

# Faith-based young adult groups

One podcast I listened to highlighted the community that exists around many churches and how joining a church can be a great way to reduce loneliness.  I am Catholic, so joining a Catholic young adult group struck me as a great idea.  Below I’ll list the main church groups that I am aware of.  I’m sure the areas has many more church groups and groups for other religions as well. 

* Saint Cecilia’s Catholic Young Adult Group
   * Of the largest young adult Catholic groups in Greater Boston (Cecilia’s, Clement’s, St. Paul’s, and St. Mary’s), I’ve heard this group leans liberal while the other groups tend to lean conservative
   * I prioritized getting involved in Saint Cecilia’s group and have been the most active in that one.  I partly focused on Saint Cecilia because they are one the only young adult groups that meets after every Sunday mass for casual socializing.  I figure that I must go to the mass anyways, so I might as well socialize afterwards.  Saint Cecilia’s also seemed to have the most events each week. 
   * Saint Celia’s masses are far longer than most Catholic churches, but the priest is very good.  After every Sunday mass, many parishioners gather downstairs for coffee and sweets.  I wish more churches would do this as it creates more community than if everyone just leaves right after the mass.  
* Saint Clement’s Catholic Young Adult Group
* Saint Paul’s Catholic Young Adult Group
* Saint Mary’s Catholic Young Adult Group
* Hillsong Church
   * I only went to one mass/sermon and it was a world of difference from my past experience of Catholic masses. 
   * The church was in a night club and played rock music
   * I’ve heard they have young adult “connect groups.”  I never tried them, but I think my cousin has tried them and had a good experience
   * I enjoyed the mass and would go again, but the music was so loud that I suspected I would probably get long term hearing loss if I continued to attend.  I could wear concert ear plugs, but then I suspect that I would be judged by my fellow young adults who I am looking to befriend for my decision to prioritize safety. 
* Park Street Church
   * When I searched for young adult church group online, this church was recommended again and again
   * While I have not tried it, it’s high on my bucket list

# Young adult meditation groups

From my research Cambridge seemed to have a disproportionate amount of meditation centers / groups than the rest of the metro area. 

* Cambridge Zen Center: Young Zen – I’ve been to two sessions of this group.  The group meditates for 25 minutes – 10 minutes sitting, 5 minutes walking, and 10 minutes setting. Then the group meets in the kitchen of their building to socialize over some coffee, tea, and sweets. I thought the group had some potential, partly since I might be able to find other people with common interests there.  I suspect best practice / self-help enthusiasts are significantly overrepresented among folks who chose to meditate.

# Book clubs

I personally am not interested in book clubs.  As with other aspects of my interests, I have narrow interest when it comes to reading books.  I don’t want to waste time reading a book that does not seem interesting or useful.  In my limited searching, I could find a book club that consistently reads books above my personal interest/usefulness threshold. 

That said, I believe there are a number of book clubs around Boston.  For someone with broader reading tastes, these groups could be good options.  If anything, similar to how running clubs are a part of the Boston culture, I think book clubs may be as well.  At least I speculate people read a lot.  With its highly educated population, very high density of institutions of higher education, cozy old architecture, and frequently unpleasant weather, I think many people here find themselves cozied up with a book in their free time.  

I think a lot of groups tack on book clubs as additional offerings.  For example, Saint Cecilia’s young adult group added a book club.  The Somerville YIMBY advocacy group and AMC 20s and 30s outing club has a book club.

# Discussion groups

While I ultimately avoided book clubs due to not wanting to read books that I wasn’t interested in, I was drawn to book clubs for their potential to foster intellectual and deep conversation.  I really enjoy talking about social issues and since I couldn’t find any existing groups, I started my own.  It’s called [Civic Podcast Discussion](https://www.meetup.com/civic-podcast-club/) and its events are posted on meetup.com.  We’ll see if this group is still active by the time you are reading this 😊.  It’s been running for almost a year now.  During each session we usually focus on a particular social issue (e.g. the brokenness of higher ed, the reduced objectivity of the media, the loneliness crisis, etc.) diagnosing the problem and identifying solutions.  After the first few sessions, I added the option to grab dinner afterwards.  People came from word of mouth and from the meetup.com listings.  For the first few months, the participants mostly changed up each session.  Eventually a core group formed that I let them completely take over advertising and facilitating events for the last two months. 

I did find some other discussion groups that meet regularly and focus on deep topics.  I’ve attended all but Skip The Small Talk, but not enough to know how consistent the attendees are.  I enjoyed the events that I did attend and found conversations often reached a deeper level than I would normally attain even with acquaintances I’ve met up with a number of times.

* Ikeda Center: Dialogue Nights
* Millenial Crisis: Boston Social Conversations
* Skip the Small Talk – Unlike the other two, these are paid events.

# Dance / yoga / fitness classes

I tried doing dance classes both in NYC and Boston, since I sometimes like to dance to music at bars/clubs.  I found the classes quite boring as we just practiced the same dance moves to one song for entire sessions.  I’ve tried yoga and a fitness class, but I found everyone left immediately afterward.  I actually called and emailed a number of yoga and fitness studios in or near Boston asking if they tended to have participants congregate and socialize after class. Virtually all said no.  One yoga studio employee said that he worked in the fitness industry for decades and that in his experience people don’t tend to socialize much after classes.  They are in the mindset of working out and then getting on with their day.  I did have one yoga studio claim to have more of a sense of community.  The studio had a sitting area in their lobby outside of their classrooms where people sometimes congregate after class, especially on the weekends.  For reasons I won’t go into, I decided not to pursue yoga.  However, this seemed like a promising option.  The studio was Soma Yoga in the North End.  Ultimately thought, dance/fitness classes didn’t seem like particular good gathering of people for the purpose of friend making. 

# Role playing & board game groups

I was interested in trying a dungeons and dragons group, as it reminded me of games I enjoyed playing with family members as a kid.  Finding a group was no easy task, but I eventually found one off reddit (the thread may have been on r/Boston).  I also did a drop-in beginner session that Trident bookstore offered.  I ultimately did not enjoy the game much.  I wanted to have more creative control over my actions in the game and found myself constrained by the rules. 

I am not interested in board games (I think of them as “bored games” haha).  However, I know many people are.  Like book clubs, I saw recurring board game nights attached to other groups (e.g. Saint Mary’s Catholic group had one, the AMC 20s and 30s group had one).  I wish I was interested in board games, as they could be a great way to meet people as well as deepen relationships (could organize a board game night at my apartment).

# Professional meetups

Name your profession and unless it’s super niche I speculate that there is probably a professional meetup for it in Greater Boston.  I work in product management in the tech industry and I was able to find some groups of product managers and folks in adjacent roles that met occasionally.  The most active one I found was called Boston Digital Product Leaders and advertised its events on Luma.  Luma is a good place to go for tech / biotech events. 

My profession was niche enough that there could be months long stretches with no professional meetups, but there were some.  

# Volunteering / social impact

I believe Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, highly recommended volunteering as a cure to loneliness in his book on the topic. 

Before I lived in Boston, I volunteered a few times in NYC at the Bowery soup kitchen.  The effort felt so ineffective.  For someone with education and privilege, it felt like there are much more effective ways to give back.  Rather than serving soup the volunteers could be advocating to allow more new housing to get built (instead of the housing being blocked by the area’s wealthy homeowners) which would help keep more of these people off the street ([as discussed in this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-repair-americas-broken-housing-system-with-dr/id1498802610?i=1000676927703)).  I try to steer myself to what I think are more effective volunteering opportunities, such as campaigning for pro-housing candidates for state legislature with organizations like A Better Cambridge.  However, I think a wide variety of volunteering activities could provide a sense of impact and an opportunity for friend making. 

Speaking of helping people effectively, I am drawn to the effective altruism movement.  I’ve been to a number of their events in both their NYC and Boston chapters, including their conference in Boston.  I struggled to find anyone in the community that I consistently enjoyed talking to however, so I stopped attending their events long ago.  I do consider myself an effective altruist.  Time will tell whether I’m truly much of an altruist.

**My experience making friends via groups**

My success making friends by joining groups was mixed.  I found myself bored talking to most of the people I approached since they were not particularly interested in most of the things I like to chat about.  Although my list of things to talk about (shown in my General Approach section above) might not seem that unique, I do think I have narrow interests.  I believe that this characteristic hinders my ability to make friends.  I don’t like sports (which is particularly problematic in Boston given our high density of successful major league teams), pop culture, TV, video games, and other common topics that many people enjoy discussing.  I found that I only reliably enjoyed talking to something like 1/10 of the people that I approached.  I suspect most people will have less narrow interests and will thereby have an easier time making friends than I do.  

For the 1/10 of people I did enjoy talking to, I invited them to hang out outside of the groups.  Unfortunately, I found that while these folks would often agree to hang out once or twice they would eventually stop accepting my invites and not offer their own.  In some cases, they even ghosted my messages.  This hurt.  I would say this was more unpleasant than romantic rejections.  Maybe my skin had thickened to romantic rejection a bit after being endlessly ghosted by girls I matched with on dating apps, but I was not used to platonic rejection.  Why was I rejected?  I’m sure to some extent these folks valued time with me less than I valued time with them.  I do think they were busy.  Many of them had existing more developed friendships and a significant other.  I suspect many consumed electronic entertainment, further reducing the amount of time they had to hang out with a new potential friend.  If we hung out a bit more and they got more comfortable with me, they might start to enjoy our interactions more and prioritize me as a valuable relationship in their life.  But unfortunately, we didn’t get that far.  After months of attending groups, I racked up about a dozen people that I enjoyed talking to who did not reciprocate interest. 

Was my yearlong effort trying to make friends by joining groups a failure?  I would not say so.  I did make one solid friend.  I approached him in the bar after a session of Midnight Runners and we hit it off.  He was also interested in startups, politics, and social issues.  I invited him on some big hikes I was leading in the Whites over the summer and he accepted the invites and attended.  Also, I learned just how much I thrive with frequent socializing.  I think I did more socializing during this period than during any prior phase of my life.  I had weeks where I attended 4-5 groups, attending groups on weekday nights.  While the groups were often stressful, where I approached strangers and risked rejection, I felt more energized and socially connected throughout the week.  There is research that [talking to strangers can actually make you happier](https://news.uchicago.edu/podcasts/big-brains/why-talking-strangers-will-make-you-happier-nicholas-epley) than talking to people you know.  I certainly talked to a lot of strangers and this period was one of the happiest of my life.  I suspect that I learned a lot from the trial and error and that I am better positioned to have strong friendships later in life. 

**Groups focused on friend making**

Going forward, I want to focus my efforts more on groups and events that people are deliberately attending in order to make friends.  I think folks I meet there are less likely to be too busy to have time to hang out.  So far, I’ve attended one event of both of the below friend-making organizations.  They seem promising:

* Make Friends After College Facebook Group
   * This group is very active, with a wide variety of events throughout the week
* Timeleft
   * The app has you fill out a questionnaire and then will use its algorithm to pair you with 5 potentially compatible people to grab dinner with on Wednesday night
   * This is a paid service

**Activities to deepen friendships**

Once you hit it off with someone in a group, my friend coach and the podcast recommended inviting them to meet up outside of the group.   Below is a list of ideas for hangouts.  I’ve heard it recommended to invite people to group activities or events first, to take the pressure off people having to make continuous conversation during uninterrupted 1:1 hangouts.  I’ve found this advice hard to implement.  I struggle to identify events that I think both myself and a friend candidate whom I don’t know well will like.  Second, I find group hangouts are more difficult to plan.  With group hangouts, multiple people’s schedules and flakiness must be managed. 

The Joyraft app is a great resource for finding events around Boston.  I think that the app pulls events from the same database as Boston Calendar, but I think the app may have a superior interface. Songkick is great for finding concerts.  You just enter the artists that you enjoy and they will show you when any of the artists are coming to your city. 

Here’s a bunch of activity ideas😊

* Hosting events
   * Hosting a dinner party
   * Hosting a board game night
* Tours
   * Tour homes that are historical sites
   * Innovation Trail walking tour
   * Tons of revolutionary walking tours (which I avoid out of lack of interest)
   * Food tours (expensive)
      * Politically incorrect north end food tour
   * Detective true-crime walking tour
* Active
   * Take a bike ride to Salem, MA and take a ferry back
   * Take \~10 mile bike ride through the emerald necklace from Back Bay to the Arboretum and return to Back Bay via the Southwest Corridor bike path
   * PaddleBoston - They actually offer one-way kayaking and canoeing trips on the Charles
   * Invite friend to throw frisbee in park
* Beach
   * Take the T to Revere beach or commuter rail to a North Shore beach like Singing Beach
   * Take a ferry to the Boston harbor islands.  Can swim or camp
* Food
   * Grabbing a meal at restaurant with a few friends
   * Grab hot chocolate (chocolate can temporarily boost happiness more per gram of sugar than other sweets I’ve read)
   * Grab smoothies
   * Grab drinks
* Volunteering
   * Invite friends to sign up for a shift together at a soup kitchen (e.g. The Bowery in NYC)
* Cruises
   * Boston being a harbor, has a lot of boat cruises
   * Boston architectural cruise
   * Boston speed boat cruise
* Trips
   * Day trip to a city/town accessible by commuter rail.  There are scenic towns along the North Shore coastline (e.g. Salem, Rockport, etc.).  You can also get to Providence, RI, in 1.5hours
   * Overnight trip to NYC (4.5 hour train/bus ride) 
   * Keolis Mass Adventures - trips transportation assistance intended for adults without cars
   * Ski trip weekend in Vermont (cross country or  downhill)
* Nightlife
   * Go dancing at a bar
   * Comedy show
* Misc
   * Attend a photography, art, cooking class
   * Check out AirBnb experiences
   * Watch movies at a theater or in apartment
   * Play ping pong indoors
   * Visit top of skyscraper - ViewBoston
   * Play at UGB airsoft in Bridgewater
   * Grab cheese, crackers, grapes, meats and have a picnic in a park

I (M 28) have been dating this amazing girl (F 27) for the last 2 weeks and we just had our 2nd date. I adore her already. She‘s funny, smart, the conversation flows and we laugh (albeit not hysterically). 
If we don’t see each other, we write on a daily basis and I seem to be making a good job of making her laugh.
Although this all sounds good, Im a bit worried because we haven‘t had much bodily contact (except for casual touch of the arm in conversation) and haven‘t kissed so far. 
I know this can be normal, but I have a bad feeling about it. Like she feels no chemistry or something. We did spend over six hours together yesterday though, which I guess means she enjoyed her time. 
I have never had a 2nd date that still seemed so distant and Im in my head about it. I sometimes think I should have just tried, but I didn’t want to be pushy and there didn’t seem to be „the moment“.
We are planning on meeting again though, maybe for a coffee this time instead of dinner. The cinema was also an idea she had. 

I’m a bit beside myself today, because I would really hate to mess this up. I don‘t have the best flirting game and am looking for faults on my side to explain this.

I would really like some calming words or advice from you. Thanks a lot already :)",1,1731866015.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

NAunt said - ""No, no, no, she could never do it. Sigh. You know who would have been PERFECT for this job? Me. I would have been sooooo good.""","The ad agency my husband worked for was looking for a concierge. It's entry level where you get coffees, lunches, smile at clients, read a book during down time.

Husband recommended my cousin ""C."" C and I are 20 years apart, and she was 19 at the time. 

NAunt has twins, a boy and girl. Twins were in vitro fertilization, not that that matters, but she is a single parent and rules with an iron fist. 

Growing up, anytime I tried to invite them to anything she would instantly say ""Oh no no no. They wouldn't like that!"" 

So I called my NAunt, as I didn't have C's # and let her know about the position. NAunt went CRAZY about how there is NO WAY 'C' is mentally capable of driving down to Big Midwest City. She could NEVER park, even if she made it down. AND, if she did park, she could NEVER make it into the building. She just wouldn't be able to find it.  AND, if she did make it in, she would NEVER be able to talk to clients. 'C' isn't that smart. And she's autistic with OCD. (My aunt 'diagnosed' her, personally. She does not have Autism. I don't know about the OCD? But I have never seen it.) 

BUT! Do you know who would have been PERFECT for this job!?!?! NAunt of course! 

""Oh! This job would have been PERFECT FOR ME! I can just see myself now! I am SO FUNNY! I could go into a boardroom meeting (?) and pitch the FUNNIEST ideas!!!"" 

Me - ""It's just getting coffees and lunches, but there is an opportunity to grow. Very safe, fun environment, perfect for a younger person.""

""Oh! I know, I know. BUT it would have been PERFECT for me. 'C' could never do it mentally. And have you seen what she wears! OMG, they wouldn't let her in the door."" (A nose piercing, lol) 

Me - ""No, they would love her look."" 

(grudgingly) ""Ok, I will send along your number, but I already know she wouldn't want to. And God forbid if she does, she couldn't do it and would fail.""

""C"" did end up getting the job, and my husband said she was amazing. ""She is so smart and on it. Literally one of our best employees ever."" And ""C"" loves the job, and is trying to 'take a break' from NMom.

I am 11 weeks pregnant  so still pretty early in but I've had a hard time dealing with irrational anger. To the point where I know it's irrational and still can't move past it. For example this morning me and my 8 year old (stepson) woke up before my husband, and i wanted to let him sleep in a little. I told my 8 year old that dad had planned to make a yummy breakfast and asked if he was willing to wait a little bit, not very long at all and he had no complaints. My husband woke up maybe 30 minutes later and came out of the room, and my 8 year old says ""good morning, can I please have some eggs?"" And I was just like.... irrationally angry. We don't cook fancy breakfast often and I told my 8 year old dad planned something special but the first thing he does is just demand (request) eggs. Not even 2 seconds to make his coffee or wake up. I love my husband and a lot of my anger comes from me feeling he is being mistreated. And now I don't even want my 8 year old to get the fancy breakfast because he didn't have the patients to wait before demanding his order like my husband is his servant.
Again I know even this is exaggerated. I cannot seem to control it though. I can more so over text bur in person I cannot keep these feelings in and even got angry at my husband for still making our 8 year old the nicer breakfast.

With millions of products vying for attention, having compelling listing images is crucial to standing out. 

As consumer preferences evolve, it’s essential to periodically reassess your strategy. Are your current [listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/stolen-listing-images-amazon-2022/) engaging enough? Do they effectively showcase your product’s unique features? 

If you haven’t updated your [main image strategy](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/proven-main-strategies-to-increase-ctr/) in a while, it might be time to shake things up and create listing images that captivate potential buyers and drive sales.

# How Main Images Impact Click-Through Rates

Among the images of a [product in the Amazon competitive](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-ranking-algorithm/) landscape, this seems to be the most significant one in determining click-through rates. The very first image a buyer gets while surfing listings mostly comes from the [main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-products-main-image/) of a product. 

Hence, it is one of the great aspects to attract more eyeballs. Sellers have to make their listing images as eye-catching as possible so that the visual story presents buyers with the greatest compulsion to click when enabled to [click nearly any product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mistakes-every-photographer-do-while-clicking-products-for-amazon/) at a moment’s notice.

 

# Importance of First Impressions

The saying “you never get a second chance to make a first impression” really applies to the world of e-commerce. 

The cover photo here is your product’s storefront and is what sites highlight: quality and features of the product. If **listing images** don’t catch the eye or give the right feel about the product, it can be scrolled over, thus lowering CTRs.

* For instance, a kitchen gadgets retailer can use a plain white background in advertising the new blender. But since this meets Amazon’s specifications, it may not be an attraction for customers. On the other hand, using the lifestyle image showing the blender in action blending a brightly colored smoothie will make more appeal and relevance, making customers want to look more.

 

# Visual Appeal And Branding

**Listing images** need not only be aesthetically good but also congruent with brand identity. A great brand sets an emotional tone and outlines trust and recognition in the minds of consumers. For example, an upscale-quality listing image can be used for a luxury skincare brand to convey its premium status. 

Such listing images create emotional ties that can work out very well in elevating CTRs. If the brand is credible and congruent to the value set of the customer, they are likely to click the product to understand it further.

The click-through rate will depend on the quality of images published for the listing. Relatively high-quality images in high resolution that can [provide an accurate view of the product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-ways-to-provide-product-reviews-on-amazon/) may be said to build confidence among the customers. 

* For instance, a manufacturer of headphones can have many high-resolution images where different angles and colors, and specific features of the product are depicted. In this way, more visitors will feel more comfortable with their purchase decision because of the possibility of seeing the product in greater detail.

Low-quality image presentation can be a reason for skepticism and will most probably influence decreasing possibilities of clicks. Customers may then wonder if this particular product is going to please their expectations.

 

# Lifestyle Images Impact

Adding [lifestyle photography](https://medium.com/@bluelightmedia/investing-in-lifestyle-photography-for-your-product-4b58c1a7486c) to your listing can also improve engagement. Even while standardized product photos are important, lifestyle images show the product in real-life settings, so customers can see how it fits into their lives. 

* For example, a furniture seller could use lifestyle photos of a couch in a stylishly decorated living room. This will not only highlight the product but also enable a customer to imagine using that in his or her own space, hence more likely to click. If customers can visualize using a product in a similar scenario then it is much easier to click the listing to learn about the particular product.

 

# Analyzing Competitors

Another method through which click-through rates are enhanced is by analyzing competitors’ listing images. You can look at what top-selling products in your category are using in their main images and see if there’s a recurring thread or element that would work well for your customers. 

* For example, if you realize successful competitors tend to use strong color or some type of styling for the images in their listings, you could integrate such ideas into your own. On the other hand, it’s key to be authentic to your brand; otherwise, they may confuse your line with yours.

 

# Trends in Amazon Product Photography

# The Rise of Lifestyle Images

Lifestyle images are one of the rising trends in [Amazon product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography). In this form of photography, the item is shown in real-life scenarios instead of just a product shot. That way, the buyer can now imagine how they will be using the product in the daily run of life. 

* For example, if a seller is selling kitchen appliances, he can include an image of the kitchen appliance elegantly displayed in a family’s kitchen and the appliance in use by the family. The listing images, as part of this, not only do that but also go on to prove the functionality of the product. As customers like these **listing images,** there is a good possibility for people to imagine buying them.

 

# Better Image Quality

The other important trend of it is the better-quality images. With this, camera technology has advanced to such an extent that it can equip a seller with taking extraordinary, high-resolution pictures that blow every minute detail of their products up. This is crucial in the case of products like jewelry or electronics. 

Customers want to be able to get clear fine craftsmanship or other intricate features of these items. For example, in a high-end watch segment, a seller may use macro photography for the face of the watch to display it at a higher magnification of such intricate design and quality. 

Such high-quality **listing images** build trust among the buyers and also lead to an action in the form of conversion that is, sale.

 

# Implementation of 360-Degree Images

This sort of interactive content on [Amazon product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) is popular and topping all is the 360-degree images. It allows customers to rotate a product and view the product from several angles, therefore providing a more complete understanding of the product’s features. 

This method is more suited to commodities like footwear or furniture whose dimension and shape play a vital role in the buying decision. 

* For example, a furniture vendor can post a 360-degree view of a sofa so that the interested buyer can determine the size and appearance relative to his living space. Such interesting listing images excite the buyer and thus increase sales.

 

# Using of Infographics

Infographics are also creeping into the [Amazon product photo](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography). Here, images are used in tandem with other needed information about a product, such as dimensions, benefits, and features. 

Complex information can thus be condensed to easily digestible formats, which helps customers make good decisions. 

* For instance, a fitness gear seller can include an infographic in the images attached to the listing, using lines like weight capacity and size, along with pictures indicating how to use it. This development not only clarifies but also tends to enhance the appearance of the [product listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/increase-amazon-sales-with-product-listing-variations-complete-guide/).

*Read More:* [*How Does Amazon Product Photography Affect Conversion Rates?*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-amazon-product-photography-affect-conversion-rates/)

# Presence of Video Content

Even though still images play an essential role, video content is increasingly being added into [product listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/). Videos permit customers to view how something is made or how it’s used to achieve optimum performance or benefits. 

* For example, a cosmetics retailer could make a video on the application procedure of a cosmetic product so that a customer can experience the outcome after purchasing it. Video content combined with **listing images** can work towards an engaging as well as informative shopping environment that achieves higher conversion rates.

 

# How to Use Infographics in Main Images

Infographics can carry a lot of critical information for various purposes in a visually appealing manner. In e-commerce, it might play a different game when it comes to how listing images communicate to potential customers the features, benefits, and usage of a product. 

Adding infographics strategically to your main images will improve the overall performance of **listing images** while driving click-through rates toward increased sales.

 

# Role of Infographics in E-commerce

An infographic is a graphic communication that carries text, icons, and images. When used in list images, they help draw the viewer’s attention to the main product details to facilitate quick customer understanding of what the core benefits are.

 The best use of this form of an image is in the compact markets where buyers will glance through hundreds of products within seconds on Amazon. You can ensure that your main images really catch on by using an infographic.

* For example, if you are selling a fitness tracker, the key information regarding battery life, water resistance, and suitability for different devices can also be put on an infographic. Instead of relying on potential buyers to read description texts, customers will be able to decide faster because these details will be posted clearly on **listing images.**

 

# What Makes an Effective Infographic for Main Images?

The strength to create a good infographic for **listing images** is the balance. It should be informative but without crowding. Your aim is to set forward important information in a way that informs and enhances the visual appeal of the product without drawing attention from it. 

Focus on just a few key points making your product unique with simple graphics or icons to give those attributes.

* For example, let’s take a kitchen blender. A good infographic can use images that accompany the power in watts, capacity in liters, speed settings, and other features such as self-cleaning. [Every feature](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/incredibly-effective-free-amazon-features-every-seller-should-be-using/) is depicted by an icon with optional short text to leave the images in the listing clean and entertaining.

# Principal Benefits of Infographics for Listing Images

One of the highest benefits of using infographics with listing images is instant clarity. Most shoppers, when doing e-commerce, are too busy to bother reading down long paragraphs of product descriptions. 

Infographics break up complicated chunks of information into easily digestible sections, thus enabling shoppers clearly to know what your product offers.

For instance, if you are selling a skincare set, you can design an infographic that lists the benefits of every item in this set. 

Thus, instead of making potential customers read out long descriptions, you can just post the main picture and attach the description below, saying that the set includes a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer with its benefits. It makes your **listing images** attractive enough to draw the buyer’s attention and make them click.

 

# How to Design Infographics for Main Images

While creating infographics for your listing images, ensure the design is very simple and well-understood. The text should be readable from the smallest screens. Use contrasting colors to draw key information, and ensure readability of the text. 

The fonts must be simple and should not clutter the image with excessive text. The bottom line is providing essential information without overwhelming the reader.

You can illustrate images for an example of wireless earbuds with an infographic consisting of features like battery life, range, or ability to filter out noise, charging time, etc. Use icons to label each feature and short descriptive phrases alongside each. It should be clean in design and not overcrowded since white space provides clarity.

 

# Examples of Effective Infographic Usage

# Healthy Supplements 

You sell a dietary supplement. In this case, you might include some infographic images in a listing, mentioning the key ingredients, the benefits of the ingredients, and suggested uses. 

You add a visual element to the image, like a capsule icon immediately next to the dosing information or a leaf immediately next to “natural ingredients” that will provoke more interest. In this way, a would-be customer gets an instant clue about what they are getting and why it’s good for them.

 

# Electronic Devices 

For smartwatches, infographics can describe features such as water resistance, battery life and compatibility with various devices in electronic products. **Listing images** can incorporate text and icons that explain the key selling points at a glance while not only providing mere representations of the product.

 

# Kitchen appliances

 Infographics are very useful for listing images of kitchen appliances. For example, the main picture of an air fryer can feature some of the more important functions, such as the temperature range, various cooking modes, capacity, and energy efficiency, in simple icons and a short description. 

So customers get all the relevant information to make a purchase decision without having to scroll down.

 

# Best Practice for Integration of Infographics in Listing Images

While infographics can spice **listing images** a bit, here are a few best practices to really make them count:

 

* Emphasize the most distinguishing features of your product. For instance, if you’re selling travel backpacks, it could specifically point out water resistance, just how light it is, and all its compartments.

 

* Icons: They make some information easier to understand. For image lists, icons would represent attributes like the amount of time the device lasts when the battery is turned off or whether it can be waterproof or the size of a product, hence easy for customers to understand information about features and attributes.
* Uniform Design: All listing images should have the same style. Having the same fonts, colors, and styles for icons will have uniform designs, thus making your product look professional, at its best, and ready to sell.
* Don’t Overcrowd The Image: Too much information may overwhelm the buyer. Keep the infographic simple and avoid trying to stuff too much text into it. Use bulleted points judiciously but let visual elements abound.

 

# The Effect of Product Packaging in Main Images

# How Product Packaging Impacts Customer Perception

[Product packaging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylrobinson/2024/02/28/psychology-of-product-packaging-how-it-plays-into-profitability/) says a lot at first glance. It may tell consumers that the product is of high quality, eco-friendly, or provides specific benefits. For example, sustainable consumer purchase decisions are attracted by well-designed packages with eco-friendly symbols. 

Similarly, ingredients or usage meant for easy labeling, among other key selling points, are likely to appeal to the consumer who seeks that feature.

One more thing that determines the perceived value is the design of packaging displayed in listing images. Simple, elegant packaging would probably indicate a superior product while cluttered or not very attractive packaging may discourage the customer. 

Therefore, while designing **listing images**, sellers have to think about how they want their packaging to look when viewing the listing images and if it sends the right message.

* For example, a seller of high-end skincare products will discover that the white, minimalist packaging could provide for very prominent and favorable listing images, so emphasis can be placed on premiums, which would imply charging more for it.

 

# Creating a Connection With Packaging Design

[Amazon customers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/consumer-insights-on-amazon/) are looking to get immediate visual cues that will tell them if the product fits the bill. One aspect that would connect immediately is packaging. Brighter colors with more playful design packaging would appeal to younger crowds. 

Understated packaging would appeal to professionals or adults searching for something sophisticated. Including packaging in listing **images** gives the seller assurance of appealing to the audience even before a description is read.

 

* Example: If kids’ toys are being sold, the listing images will be used by parents who want to buy gifts for the kids. Selling packaging images that mostly display fun, bright, and engaging package designs will attract a customer to purchasing the product. If the package has clear [branding and product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/sell-branded-products-on-amazon/) features, then it will easily enable shoppers to recognize it as child-friendly and safe.

# Best Practices for Featuring Packaging in Listing Images

Use particular practices that improve the look of images with packaging and enhance the effectiveness of your strategy when adding packaging to your Amazon **listing images**.

 

# Observe How Your Product Looks Packaged

From within and outside the packaging, the product will be presented to the possible buyers of what they will receive fully. 

This is especially helpful for products whose perceived value is added through the packaging such as gift sets or subscription boxes. Images presenting an image of the packaging with the actual product will help create an all-around view of what to expect.

* Example: For a coffee brand, listing images will be handy as they can indicate the quality of the product seen through the quality of the coffee beans, and knowing what the packaging would look like. This approach can further stress the premium or artisanal features of the coffee.

 

# Use High-Quality Images Highlighting Packaging Details

Bad-quality images may give an unhealthy impression of your product. Ensure that all the **listing images** have good resolution, proper lighting, and highlight every important feature of the packaging.

 If information like labeling is contained in the packaging, make sure that same information is clearly visible in the images. 

Pointing to other essential features on the packaging, which may include organic certification, eco-friendly packaging, or nutrition-related information, can snatch the attention of those buyers who are so emphatic about such factors.

* Example: For a brand of protein powder, the [product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-tips-for-amazon-fba-scroll-stopping-product-images/) of close-up shots of its pack label, indicating flavor, nutrition facts, and certifications, would attract health-conscious consumers looking for specific product attributes.

 

# Lifestyle Shots to Highlight Packaging Appeal

Lifestyle images really do connect with customers. It will be nice to add lifestyle shots where the packaging is integrated into real scenes of life. That would allow a customer to imagine how they would interact or use a product. 

Such **listing images** will give an even better emotional connection, and then they will actually imagine the product is part of their lives.

* For instance, if they are selling scented candles, display pictures of the candles in their packaging within a living room setting so the shopper can envision buying the product for themselves or to give to another.

 

# Examples of Compelling Product Packaging Strategies on Amazon

* Apple Packaging Apple is renowned for its minimalist and very minimalistic packages like an iPhone or an AirPod. Clean white boxes are each time featured in the listing image as they show quality and aesthetic style to reinforce the identity of a premium technology brand. 
* The homogeneity that packaging brings to design helps [build brand](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/build-your-brand-on-amazon-with-short-product-videos/) recognition where customers just know what they are getting the moment they purchase products from Apple.
* Lush Cosmetics has eye-catching and bright packaging that is instantly recognizable. They use, in their **listing images**, simple yet telling information packaged in the focus of their eco-friendly and hand-made products. Utilizing packaging to add value for each product helps to carry the brand message of a green/sustainable offering, something that’s crucial to their visual marketing on Amazon.
* The packaging of LEGO’s is excellent and has really beautiful and appealing designs that pop. The catalog images feature a picture of the box, and many even have pictures of what the model looks like when fully assembled. This allows the consumer to see what the product can look like, but it can also appeal more to children and their parents together while purchasing. Why it may need refreshing periodically

Updates of packaging strategies must be as frequent as updates of products, listing images, and the general [marketing strategies](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/20-stats-to-drive-your-amazon-video-marketing-strategy/). Trends change, consumer preferences evolve, and what worked last year may not have the same effect today. 

The assessment of your [product packaging](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-tips-for-amazon-fba-scroll-stopping-product-images/) in listing images will keep your Amazon store looking fresh, modern, and in line with current market demands. New and refreshing packaging can tell more about new features, seasonal promotions, or limited-edition products, thereby taking it to more customers.

* Example: Chocolate brand changes the package according to themes that reflect holidays such as Christmas or Valentine’s day and uses [updated listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-structure-your-listing-updates/) images that evoke urgency and exclusivity.

 

# How to Use Props Effectively in Amazon Main Images

# Examples of Effective Prop Usage in Listing Images

# Kitchen Gadgets

Props can also be a great option for explaining the features of the product for products such as kitchen appliances. When you are selling a blender, displaying it next to fresh fruits may help your customers visualize the possibility of blending their smoothies. 

In such a case, **listing images** that show fruits being blended will make the product more appealing by providing context to it thereby making chances of sale higher.

* Example: A seller holding a citrus juicer can add props in the image such as partially peeled oranges or lemons on either side of the citrus juicer. This will show what it is made for, adds aesthetic value, and shows its use without crowding up the image.

 

# Clothing and Accessories

A prop in clothing gives a sense of how the product looks in a real-world setting. Therefore, for baby clothing, it might add a sense of comfort and warmth when there is a toy or blanket as a prop in listing images. Of course, care must be taken that the props do not overshadow the main product.

* Example: Pre-list images of baby onesie by including a stuffed animal in the background. This makes an image appealing without removing the image’s focus on the product; hence, it becomes cozy and relatable to any parent shopping for a cute onesie for his or her child.

 

# Electronics and Gadgets

For example, showing a smartphone case as something simple, having a phone and more items like a wallet next to it, helps drive portability and design. Props can also be used to show scale, especially for the smaller-sized gadgets, giving a customer an idea of size before purchase.

For example, to list a portable speaker, an image next to a smartphone and sunglasses could easily indicate the size and portability, making it easily relatable to customers’ everyday life.

 

# When to Make Use of Props in Listing Images

Props can add much to **listing images**, but they should be used selectively and purposefully. A prop should only enhance the visual story of the product and not clutter the image or compete against it. 

Props do well in secondary images where Amazon gives more latitude for creativity but in the main image ensure it remains with a clean clear view of the product.

 

# Balance Props and Focus on the Main Product

One of the challenges in using props is not to draw attention away from the product. [Listing images should show the product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-do-for-a-killer-amazon-product-listing/) as a hero in the image, and props are there only to facilitate enhancement in understanding and appeal. 

Achieve this by keeping props subtle, strategically placed, and secondary in color and contrast. This way, the customer’s eye will remain drawn to the main product.

* Example: Instead of simply showing a laptop stand, putting one in an image with a laptop, mouse, and keyboard helps a customer see how the product will fit into their workspace. But ensure that the leading item, that is, the stand, is front and center of the photo with props turned slightly blurry or desaturated to call attention to it.

*Read More:* [*5 Things You Need to do for a Killer Amazon Product Listing*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-do-for-a-killer-amazon-product-listing/)

# Don’t Use Too Many Props in Listing Photos

Prop overuse will create an image that is almost cluttered and overwhelming to the potential buyer. In addition, prop usage can sometimes create confusion as to what is included in the sale. 

Avoid cluttered images by being thoughtful with your use of props and avoiding images where the prop becomes the focus point of the composition. Remember people are trying to envision how they will use a particular product-not how to create an artistic photograph.

* For instance, if the theme for the product is pictures of a wristwatch, then there’s a possibility that it might help produce a lifestyle look when placed with other jewelry pieces. Yet, ensuring that the watch must be the focal point of the picture and not much prop, so there won’t be a misperception of what is included in the sale.

 

# Adapting Your Main Image for Amazon Prime Day and Christmas

 

[Amazon Prime Day](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-prepare-amazon-prime-day-coupons-and-exclusive-deals/) is the biggest sale event on Amazon, offering extreme discounts and deals which are exclusive to its Prime members. For this special day, the shoppers will look for the best available offers for them, so your primary image must state not only the value of the product but also the special offer it carries.

* Another compelling move is the overlay of bold text within images of your listings to attract special deals or limited offers. From the marketer’s point of view, as an electronics merchant selling electronics products, you might use a picture of the product surrounded by a large “30% OFF” sign or a banner that reads “Limited Time Offer.” This instantly gives shoppers the urge to make a deal.

 

Lifestyle shots on [Prime Day](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-prime-day-2024-what-to-expect/) will give your product an emotional appeal. For example, if you sell kitchen appliances, you can use your product during a family gathering in which it makes meal preparation easier and more fun to do. 

Visual elements that make people feel excited and satisfied can really stay for a long time in people’s shopping heads during competitive Prime Day.

 

# Christmas and New Year Adaptation

Christmas and New Year are perfect moments for sellers to relate emotionally to customers. Of course, the theme of the season of holidays is all about giving, joy, and togetherness; therefore, your main images should reflect that. 

While adapting your listing images for this season, you could contemplate using some festive themes, colors, and props that give a feeling of warmth and celebration.

* For example, if you are marketing home decor items, imagine wrapping them in garlands of holiday lights or pillows covered with ornaments. Not only will this show off the product but also let customers imagine how it might add to their own holiday celebration. 

You may even be able to tug at consumers’ heartstrings by using wrapped gifts or holiday cards as a behind-the-scenes element in your [product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-creative-amazon-product-photography-ideas-to-stand-out/) to appeal to people looking for the perfect gift for that special someone.

 

# Use Promotion Of One-Time Holiday Offers

This includes any special promotions tied to the holiday season. You can use a “Holiday Sale” or “Gift Guide” theme for your **listing images**. Use text that creates the sense of urgency of an offer, using words such as “limited time only,” “free shipping,” or “bundled for this holiday season.” This will make buyers place orders quickly.

 

# Example Of Successful Image Adaptation

Consider a seller selling only fitness gear. For Prime Day, they can use demonstration-like main images of their products in action; this would present how the gear enhances workout routines with a big “Prime Day Deal” overlay.

 Come near Christmas, the seller can adapt the main images to feature the gear as the ideal gift for fitness enthusiasts, incorporating holiday-themed backgrounds and text playing on gift-giving.

 

# How to Measure the Success of Your Amazon Listing Images

# Metrics for Evaluating Listing Images

There are various key metrics that can be watched to track the success of your [Amazon ](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)**listing images.** More specifically, the click-through rate gives the number of users who click through to your listing after viewing the images. 

That is often used as an indicator when more users are inquiring about your product after they clicked on the listing image.

The conversion rate represents the number of clicks on your listing that convert into a sale, therefore important. In case your listings are getting clicked but still not selling, then this is something to believe that perhaps your images may not be displaying appropriately or may not meet the customer’s expectation.

Break down the bounce rate of your product page. High bounce rates suggest customers aren’t finding what they’re looking for from the images in the listing. That disconnect can therefore cause significant problems in overall sales performance and brand reputation.

 

# Tools to Analyze Image Performance

Measuring the success of the listing images becomes much easier when you use the right tools. Amazon does offer some analytical capabilities directly through Seller Central. By using this dashboard, you can track CTR and conversion rate, among other important metrics, to see how your images are doing.

A couple of third-party tools that give more intense insights. They analyze not only performance but whether images actually impact listings as a whole, meaning rankings in searches or sales. Utilizing these tools will pinpoint exactly which **listing images** best resonate with your target audience.

A/B testing is also a super powerful tool through which one can measure the effectiveness of images. Here, you can apply this technique to compare two different images of the same product to see which works better. 

After comparing the results, you might understand which of those characteristics makes an image successful and refine your future listings according to them.

 

# Role of Customer Feedback

Customers are another fine source of assessment about your listing images. Their reviews and questions may give you an idea of whether you have captured the image of the product well. 

When more than one customer feels that the picture in the listing and what he gets to appear is pretty different, it is a sign that some amendments need to be done.

 

You can also ask your customers to make comments on the pictures that are included in the listing. That will not only allow you to collect better information but also involve the customer as part of your brand.

 

# The Link Between Main Images and SEO

Amazon SEO is the process of optimizing your [product listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/from-click-to-cart-how-to-optimize-your-amazon-product-listings-for-sales/) to increase their visibility on search engines. Primarily, Amazon SEO is meant to rank products higher in search results when customers type in the necessary keywords. 

While most focus on keywords within titles and descriptions, most people are missing a crucial role in SEO: **listing images.**

Listings with images drive enormous customer engagement and conversion values, which both play critical roles in the Amazon ranking algorithm. An optimized main image can attract clicks, but it also is an attribute that drives your overall listing performance to better search rankings.

 

# Importance of Primary Images

The first thing a buyer sees is the main image of the product listing. It’s going to be of higher quality, clearer, and more interesting if you offer high-quality images that capture one’s interest and will encourage them to click on your listing. 

Studies have shown listings with professional photographs tend to have a better performance rate and convert more.

Images also impact the click-through rate, directly determined by your main image. The more attractive your primary image is to your customers, the more likely it is that they will click on your listing. The higher the CTR rate you have, the more Amazon flags your product to associate it with searches and ranks it better.

 

# Optimize Your Listing Images for SEO

Some of the best practices would be that your main image is compliant with Amazon guidelines. The rule of thumb for any main image is to be of a very high resolution; it should be at least 1000 pixels in width or height, and have the product on a white background. 

In this way you are ensuring that it complies with Amazon requirements while also making the listing look professional.

 

Adding [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) that capture your product in use can be added and may help your potential buyers connect with your product and understand better how it fits into their daily life. The more image-rich your listing is, the greater the engagement and longer visit duration with high-quality images.

# Using Keywords within Image Metadata

[Amazon doesn’t allow keyword](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/ways-to-do-amazon-keywords-research/) stuffing with image files, but there’s still a way to optimize your listing images by using meta-tags. Use relevant keywords with the file names and alt text of your images. Although most search engines index text, well-structured metadata could still help listings.

This will determine the tags used in labeling your image files whereby you are to ensure they encompass relevant keywords of what you are selling. This step may enable the algorithm to better understand through ensuring that Amazon’s algorithm has a better way of deciding the ranking in search results.

*Read More:* [*How to Optimize Your Amazon Product’s Main Image?*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-products-main-image/)

# Monitoring and Adjusting Based on Performance

Once you optimize your images to the best of your capability, you need to monitor them over time. While optimizing, use Amazon’s analytics tools, which will give you an insight over changes in click-through and conversion rates. 

You would identify some images as below par; you could carry out an A/B test to identify better visuals. However, keep abreast of the evolving aspects of Amazon’s SEO and image policy algorithm as well. Update listing images about your products on time and regularly with best practices to ensure that they stay alive and competitive in the marketplace.

**STOP-LOSS PROTOCOL**

My background is in finance. When investing, it's smart to do something called a ""[stop-loss order](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/use-stop-loss.asp)"" — an order that says if a stock you own falls to a certain point, sell it. Say you bought at $15 hoping it would go up, but you put a stop-loss at $10. That way you can only lose $5 at most instead of potentially losing your entire $15. 

Right now, in this questionable metaphor, we have $15 of rights. For me, I decided that my $10 of rights — my stop-loss to leave America — was reversal of trans rights/anti-discrimination protections at the federal level. For you, it might be that your particular community is targeted; that abortion is banned; that a particular law is passed or dissolved; IDK. But think about it seriously.

**GO WHERE?**

Once you know what your stop-loss is, it's time to figure out where you'd go. Subs like r/AmerExit are helpful, especially [this post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmerExit/comments/urwlbr/a_guide_for_americans_that_want_to_get_out_of/) and [this website](https://whichcountrytomoveto.com/) might be too. If you have family abroad obviously start there. Other than that, do you speak any other languages? Have any foreign friends? But most importantly, **where's your industry?** Your best bet is probably going to be getting an employment visa, so finding a country that has plenty of work for whatever type of job you have is going to be critical. 

**OKAY, HOW?**

Realistically, you'll probably need an employment visa. Requirements differ by country, but you can either find jobs boards like LinkedIn or Indeed and start applying, find large companies in your target country and look for their internal postings, or find companies that have locations both here and in your target country and apply here then later ask for a transfer. You could also apply to go to college overseas but that's often kind of expensive.

If you're not currently employed, or thinking about changing industries, find a job or a school/skills program in a ""critical skills"" occupation. Different countries call them different things but basically they're the industries that everyone wants and that always have shortages. STEM fields, healthcare, business professionals in specific fields like accounting and finance (so general business not so much). Generally if you can do one of these jobs you'll have an easier path to immigration.

**PREPARING**

Stuff you should do anyway:

* Secure your documents (passports, personal documents for all family members, marriage certificate) and make copies
* Get copies of medical records including vaccination records

Stuff to do to prepare for the move:

* Research flights/hotel costs
* Research the process of immigrating with pets if relevant
* Look into schools/child care if relevant
* Look into housing 
* Fill out whatever paperwork's needed and pay processing fees for visas/immigration (your company should help with a lot of this if you're coming on an employment visa)
* Get some of the local currency
* Decide on whether you're going to ship things overseas/if it's worth it financially and research what company you'll use 
* Identify what bags you'll bring your items in for the flight
* (Potentially) open a bank account in the target country (might not be able to depending on location's laws)

I'm making three categories of my belongings (sell, donate, keep) and three categories of belongings to keep. Those categories are ""leisurely move"", ""I have 24 hours to leave"" and ""I have 30 minutes to leave"". 

""30 minutes"" is bare essentials for the ""I am buying the plane ticket on the way to the airport"" situation. AKA the ""Project 2025 says pretty clearly that they want to make my existence illegal and suggests some ways they might do it; someone is headed to my house to arrest me"" list. Identity and medical documents, medications, electronics and chargers, a few sets of clothing (especially socks and underwear), small toiletries/hygiene items, snacks, some N95 masks, a raincoat, and a couple little sentimental items. Should all fit in a carry-on and personal item.

""24 hours"" is the ""they've started arresting people but aren't at my door yet"" list. Everything from ""30 minutes"" plus some more clothing, a couple other pairs of shoes, a few small hobby supplies that would be expensive to buy again, and a couple more sentimental items. Adds a checked bag. 

""Leisurely move"" is all the stuff I want to bring, not being packed under threat of imminent arrest. Just, like, got a job or whatever.

**COMMUNITY**

A lot of us are thinking about leaving. Chances are pretty good that some of us might go to the same places. Talk to each other about your target countries and seeing if you can share resources, research, hell, maybe even a shipping container. We're stronger together.

If you have any questions about what I've said, feel free to ask them. If you have other advice/resources, LMK and I'll add it to the post! I hope this helps at least one person.",9,1731864773.0,TwoXPreppers,0,0.85,False
1gtiryy,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1gtiryy/what_is_love_let_me_tell_you_about_my_story_and/,What is love ? Let me tell you about my story and how I feel with him( long). ,"I love my partner too much we have been in a long distance relationship for a year and a month ago he came to see me when I saw him I didn’t feel butterflies or nerves but I felt at home and at peace. I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can’t help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn’t let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can’t tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn’t like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can’t help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn’t there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don’t know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestlé dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don’t know anyone’s birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don’t forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",2,1731864687.0,love,1,1.0,False

1gtipcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Acts_Of_The_Apostles/comments/1gtipcj/the_bonding/,The Bonding,"**Greetings in The Mighty Name of Jesus, The Christ!!!**

 

**The Bonding**

 

 

**Ecclesiastes 4:12 KJV**

**“And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.""**

 

Brothers and Sisters Whom are you Bonded to? In the above Scripture I only want to speak on the last phrase. It is important to Understand that there are Three Stands that are Braded together forming One Strand. I want you to also Understand that the Scripture says they are Not Quickly Broken, meaning they can be broken over time if allowed.

 

The Third Seed of the Seed Sower says this…

 

**Matthew 13:22 KJV**

**“He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.""**

 

They are Bond to the Cares of the World and Money and because of this, they were Unfruitful in Jesus.

 

Here we see a Positive Binding and a Negative Binding, both are Strong, both bear Fruit, both have Heavenly and Hellish properties. We must Understand that Jesus Stood Alone and Prevailed against Sin, that Jesus was Bond to The Father and The Two withstood Satan and we Must Understand that The Father, Jesus and The Holy Spirit can NEVER be broken, for the Three are One Cord in All Things.

 

In Our Walk the first set of Scriptures is always True, it is a Formula that The Father wrote before time ever began and it will Stand the Test Of Time to the end. Now we start to look at us and Whom we are Bond to with Understanding of the Threefold Cord.

 

**1 John 5:7-8 KJV**

**""****^(7)** **For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.** **^(8)** **And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.""**

 

This Formula of Three cannot be done away with, even if someone claims to be Standing Alone, the Formula is Unbroken! If we always remember this, then we must always Examine ourselves to see Where, To Whom, we are Bond to. The Scriptures tells us Not to be Unequally Yoked, saying what Fellowship does Light have with Darkness. Many think this Scripture only pertains to Marriage but it goes beyond that.

 

**2 Corinthians 6:14 KJV**

**“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?""**

 

Understand the Dynamics that The Father has put in place, we are Flesh and Blood, we Accept Jesus as Savior and Lord and we are Sealed by The Holy Spirit, making a Threefold Cord. In Marriage, we meet our Spouse and according to Scripture we are no longer Two, but have become One, so then, the Original Dynamics still exist!

 

**Genesis 2:24 KJV**

**“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.""**

**Matthew 19:3-6 KJV**

**""****^(3)** **The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?** **^(4)** **And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made \[them\] at the beginning made them male and female,** **^(5)** **And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?** **^(6)** **Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""**

 

I Choose to be Bound to Jesus, The Bible and The Holy Spirit, it is not forced on me, I make a Daily Decision to Keep this Bond in my everyday Life. I Remind myself all of the time that The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one by doing things that most people do not think of, for example, when I Tie a Knot, I always Tie it Three Times, I use Three scopes of Coffee when I make a pot of coffee, I use Three spoons of sugar in my Coffee or Tea and all of the other countless things I do to Remind me on a Daily Bases, The Father, Son and The Holy Spirit, they are three, but one.

 

**Luke 16:13 KJV**

**“No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.""**

 

Even in this Scripture the Formula of Three has not changed. If we take the Scriptures from earlier that Three Bear Witness, it still stands in this above Scripture. If I Accompany myself with the World, it stands, if I Accompany myself with God, it stands. The Binding of Three is always consistent.

 

Brothers and Sisters be Not Ignorant! For Whom or even What you put as a Priority in Your Life, the Dynamics do not change, for you are Bound to Jesus then His Word and The Holy Spirit have to be Bound to you, even if you say you are Bound to Jesus and yet Follow Not His Word and Do Not Obey The Holy Spirit, the Dynamics remain!

 

**Matthew 7:24-27 KJV**

**""****^(24)** **Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:** **^(25)** **And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.** **^(26)** **And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:** **^(27)** **And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.""**

 

If Your Foundation is not that of the Dynamics that Jesus set, then, you will Fall, you will Fail to be a Disciple, a Servant, of Jesus. Why do you think The Church is so divided…for Man and Satan have Broken The Foundation on which Jesus has built…

 

**Ephesians 2:19-22 KJV**

**""****^(19)** **Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;** **^(20)** **And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner \[stone\];** **^(21)** **In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:** **^(22)** **In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.""**

 

The Dynamics, Formula, has not changed and will not change, even though Man and Satan have tried to Change what The Father, Son and Holy Spirit have created.

 

Now, before anyone thinks that the Word Formula is something that can be obtained by just doing, it cannot be done. I use the word Formula just to show Their Bindings that is all and how thing intertwine with one another. There is only one right way for this to work and that is, Jesus must be Your Savior and Lord, but the same type of affects work if The World is Your Savior and Lord.

 

As Jesus has said you can Not have Two Masters and as other Scriptures say that to Whom We Obey we have become Their Servants.

 

**Romans 6:16 KJV**

**“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?""**

 

This Dynamic includes Family, Friends, Associates, Denomination, Work, Sports anything that you put a Priority on above or equal to Jesus. If you really understood this, there would be No Walls that separate us, there would be No Denominations claiming to be the church, we would just be The Church. In the Godly Dynamics that has been created by God there is No Division of any kind, but now, we are Divided because one or more of the Dynamics have changed. Examine yourself against the Threefold Cord in every area of Your Life and see if it Godly or Worldly!!!

 

 

 

 

**Amen and Amen!!!**

1gtilzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Savotta/comments/1gtilzw/kahakka_25_commuting_and_camera_pack/,Kahakka 25 - Commuting and Camera pack,"*Warning…long read…*

2-3 weeks ago I received the Kahakka 25. I have planned for it to become my commuting pack and also my camera pack for day hikes. Until now it has served mainly for commuting, but today I put it through the paces being a camera pack.

**Kahakka being a commuting pack.** It performs admirably. I was a bit concerned it should be bulkier than I wanted.  Not so. It’s not bulky at all. It has a really nice profile and only builds out when needed to. The side pouches have a quite streamlined profile both flat and being filled with clothes, umbrella or water bottles. I like it a lot for commuting, only minor remark is that I would like a loop or something in the zippered lid pocket to tie in a small pouch carrying my keys. Anyway it’s not a big thing, but would be a nice have. That said, the two zippered pockets are large enough to carry what I usually need, e.g. headlamp, toiletries, powerbank, and all kinds of small thingies. The bladder pouch on the inside effectively works to store my laptop, and also my iPad. Im using a thin woolen sit pad between them as a divider not to have them scratch. There are enough room inside for my need of clothes and food. If I really need to carry a bit more the side pocket comes in handy. While commuting I prefer to store the waist strap and Berg buckles behind the padded mat provided. That works great as the holes to put them through is just the right size to make them stay inside the pack, and I don’t feel the buckles through the pad.

[Really nice!](https://preview.redd.it/eklw81ap1i1e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=890a37c53fc7d4c06c19c9abb8e3412484225739)

**Daily camera pack.** I have used several different camera packs and backpacks to carry my camera gear. Usually these open the front to show off the lenses and other camera gear. Unless of course you would need to carry all the lenses and everything you own for a day hike the Kahakka wins with the right insert fit to it. I normally carry my camera and a few of my most suited lenses. These are usually my Nikon Z8, Z400 f4.5 with 2x tele converter, Z14-30 and Z24-120, and then some filters, batteries and a tripod. I tend to carry my Z8 and 24-120 on my body, while the lenses and other gear are stored inside the pack. From earlier I have a great insert, the Billingham Hadely Pro with dividers. This one performs great with the Askare, and it just happened to work superbly with the Kahakka 25 as well. Just a note of caution is that when strapping things hard to the side pouches the space for the insert will be less inside. That is no issue if the insert is on the upper part of the pack, but can be a bit too tight if you would like it at the bottom. I used it on the top today and could easily close the lid and even keep my walking sticks horizontally between the lid and the ”flaps”. This way my gear is also very easily accessed.

[Not bulky at all even with thermos and sticks](https://preview.redd.it/dk6g5bju1i1e1.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca9196b67c8356289217053084a129de1bd5150d)

The insert fits my Z400 with attached 2x teleconverter and my 14-30 lens using the dividers cleverly. It will still be some space left to allow for some other things inside if they are wrapped in soft material. For this trip I put some clothes in a pouch at the bottom, the insert above, and some sandwiches on top of that, not to be crushed. It was a lot of space left to add more items below the insert if I would. Tripod, coffee thermos, water bottle and walking sticks were placed inside the side pouches. I also tried the walking sticks between lid and ”top flaps”. Worked great. With all this the weight was around 9 kg. The relatively low profile of the pack was easy to carry in the woods. I did not get stuck under branches.

The waist belt and Berg buckle was used to keep the weight on my hips and off my shoulders. I cannot be happier. It just worked great as the Berg buckle is a joy to use. It’s quick and easy. The belt hugs just enough to carry the weight. I had possibilities to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking, hard or loose, depending on terrain and amount of looseness I preferred. No issues with shoulder pain at 9 kg, that’s for sure as I was mainly wearing a thin woolen shirt. I was walking in relatively fast pace for 7-8 km, I expected to be sweat on the back, but not so. Not sure how this was. I think it had to do with the waist belt hugging really great and using a soft bag for clothing at the bottom of the pack. This formed a great lumbar support which also made a slight space in between my upper back and the pack as I didn’t need to tie down the shoulder straps very hard. Anyway it was very comfortable to carry and much dryer than I expected.

Getting the camera gear in and out of the pack was easier than any specific camera pack I have used. Pop the two buckles to open the lid and there is easy and fast access to the lenses. Works very well as long as you don’t need access to more lenses than the Billingham insert can take. Usually 3-4 small lenses, or 1 large one incl. 1-2 smaller ones. You may also be able to fit a dust blower or something in there.

The Kahakka 25 is a very sturdy pack, but doesn’t weigh a lot. Normally a camera pack this size is close to twice the weight and filled with protective inserts. Often in abundance and far too much for normal carry. At least to my liking. They are usually quite boxy and bulky as well. There are backpacks that weigh less, but often much more flimsy and of more delicate material. With the Kahakka Im confident to carry tripod and other camera gear, and bringing clothes, food and whatever on day trips. It’s a comfortable and safe carry that will withstand my kind of abuse. I even do wonder if it would be suitable for a 1-2 overnight trip with less camera gear during the warmer months. I need to look into that, as that would be a nice and unexpected additional use for this pack. Perhaps with piggybacking Askare or Hatka to it, but I really don’t want to have all kinds of pouches hanging to it.

I can wholeheartedly recommend Kahakka 25 with the Billingham Hadley insert for day hikes with camera gear. It is also a great commuter pack. I have attached some pictures. I tried to add a short video, but didn't manage to attach both pics and video.

Both teams are neck and neck in the North Division, with the Steelers at 7-2 and the Ravens at 7-3. It's like watching two heavyweight boxers who just realized they left the oven on at home.

The Ravens are the favorites here, with odds around 1.57, while the Steelers are the underdogs at 2.5. But remember, in football, underdogs win about 35% of the time, which is roughly the same odds as your cat deciding to cooperate during a Zoom meeting.

Lamar Jackson is coming off a stellar performance, throwing for 290 yards and four touchdowns against the Bengals. Meanwhile, the Steelers are riding a four-game winning streak, which is impressive unless you consider that one of those wins was against the Washington Commanders, who have been about as consistent as a toddler's sleep schedule.

The over/under is set at 48.5 points, and given both teams' recent penchant for high-scoring games, the over might be the way to go. The Ravens have hit the over in all five of their away games this season, so expect the scoreboard operator to get a workout.

Now, for my best bet: Take the Steelers at +3.5 on the spread. They're playing at home, and with both teams on a hot streak, this game could easily come down to a field goal. Plus, betting on the underdog gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling of rooting for the little guy—like cheering for the office intern who finally gets the coffee order right.

I need advice interpreting a situation. I met a guy (31m) last week (35f) on a night out and came back to mine to hook up. We started chatting and spoke about hooking up and agreed we were both happy to. However after hooking up we chatted for so long and he ended up being everything I look for in a male partner and more, his work, hobbies, persona etc is so attractive and he seems like the ideal guy (I know this doesn’t exist just a turn of phrase for how I feel). He seemed to enjoy it too, and in the morning was listing all the reasons he enjoyed coming back to mine. We got coffee the next day and before he left he got my number.  I got the vibe we both wanted to see each other again but didn’t say it. 

We’ve chatted a bit, however neither of us are huge texters. He made a joke about coming over again and how he was looking forward to it, so I jumped at the chance and said how about he take me out and he said he’d love too and was putting a plan together. I was thrilled. However, since that convo, he hasn’t replied. It’s been 4 days. I don’t want to panic but usually this would indicate a ghosting. He did say he had a v busy social weekend but my friend said if he was interested he still would have checked in, but my other friend said he wouldn’t go to the effort of agreeing to a date if he wasn’t interested and I should be reassured he’ll get in touch.

What are your thoughts? I don’t want to hold out hope if this is likely a ghosting. A shame if so, I genuinely thought he was a great guy. ",1,1731863642.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I was previously on UC before university whilst I was in between jobs. 

Time goes by and I check my statements (after going back to uni when covid died down) and I've recieved my uni money, some times passes again, and I check my bank account to find that I have been paid UC. I never asked to be put back on UC so I was confused. It took me 3 months to realise this. So I called up all panicked and said what happened  how I didn't ask to be put on it, and now I owe money and feel like I'm in trouble. They said don't worry. Closed my UC case and said to go about my life. I received no letters or anything past that. 

Anywho  I need to go back on it as my hours have been greatly reduced (a manager left the business and business owner cut hours) and I can't afford everything. I'm usually skint by the third week and I don't do busses, ubers, takeaways, coffee, snacks or events. I spend all the money I make and still beg for food from my parents. 
So I'm not taking the piss .

I managed to get another job to make up the hours, but I had anticipatory panic attacks and the stress of a new job triggered insomnia and I just gave up on it. Decided it was better for me to live on peanuts than put myself through that. I went to the doctor and got medication and I signed up for therapy. I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety and OCD 3 years ago but this last few months its gotten worse. So this money will help me get through until I find the right job for me which won't trigger my anxiety. Which is very physical. I don't know who could possibly work whilst having a panic attack. My work currently do so much to help my anxiety. I have my own key and a list of jobs. I get the jobs done and its all cool. Some days I don't even see anybody on shift so having an anxiety attack isn't an issue.

1gti2zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gti2zd/just_received_my_kf8/,Just received my KF8,"After a less than stellar experience with my ENA 8, purchased in December 2021, I decided that two warranty returns for leaks plus ongoing Error 8 codes that I've learned to handle on my own, I would be better served with a new machine. Now I do a full cleaning every week plus clearing the coffee screen daily.

 I considered the E8 and Z10 as a replacement but not having access to the brew group to clean it weekly, was a ""NO"" for me. I've always had Gaggia and Saeco machines, liked them and they served me well, but I felt there was something ""better"" out there, thus the Jura. I realize the ENA 8 is not what many people would choose when considering a Jura, but I liked the size. 

After reading many posts I decided to purchase the KF8 directly from KitchenAid with a bonus of a discount opportunity from a member here. I had already looked at the machine at Williams Sonoma, was impressed with my ten minute tour of it and was likely going to purchase from them. To my good fortune I read posts here!

This is only day two but I have some observations to share and will do additional posts down the road:

1) The unit is large, solidly built and heavy (37 pounds). The back wheels make moving the unit easy to maneuver.

2) The stainless finish is beautiful and the removeable parts fit and return to the proper position as they should.

3) The screen interface is intuitive to navigate and the settings for each user are easy enough to do. Could it be better - perhaps but it works just fine.

4) I have programmed three black coffee drinks. Settings are in place for strength, volume and temperature for espresso, coffee and Americano. I only drink an Americano when making iced coffee. The taste of each drink is excellent and as a true coffee lover, I will continue to experiment with the settings.

5) I finally get a hot temperature pull on each of the choices. I haven't set it for the hottest, but I will do an espresso at the hottest setting later. The ENA 8 was warm and that's it. 

6) I have not set any milk drinks yet as I only do those for friends and family. I will get to that in a few days, or not until I have to, although an occasional decaf macchiato is an enjoyable after dinner coffee and won't jolt me out of my sleep given the bean type (dark roast) and strength I prefer. 

7) Having a removeable bean tray is a thoughtful design, providing the option switch easily between bean types. I'm going to order a second tray this week.

8) I know this was a good purchase and believe many of you should consider the KF series.

Do I say something before he goes to a strip club or after?,"For some background I’ve been dating him for a little over 2 years. I am what I would call a chill girlfriend compared to most. I am fine with him talking to other women whether it’s work colleagues out side of work hours or if it’s friends that he had before me. I do the same as well but I’m bisexual so I do it for guys and girls. I am fine if he wants to go to bikini baristas. I am also ok with him going to a strip club as long as it’s with friends and not by himself. 

Now the thing that’s got me all messed up is that a while ago we both had a regular at our bikini barista who we liked because she made our drinks right and was very nice. After we went there a while he went to the stand without telling me. I thought that was super weird because we tell each other where we are going incase of emergency’s we both have Life360 on. He went to the coffee stand. He told me that the barista had texted him on instagram to see if he was in the area and if he could scare off a creepy guy who was making her scared. Now we live 5 minutes away from this stand. He didn’t say anything to me that he was stopping for coffee or that she had asked him to scare a guy off. He didn’t say anything till I asked 10 minutes later after he left. So I was under the thinking he would not have said anything unless I asked. I did let him know that it made me super uncomfortable that he went to help her. That stand has more then enough protection to fend someone off till police get their and the nearest one is 15 min if they didn’t speed 

This man is amazing I do love him and don’t want to leave him we have had very honest communication with one another. I know he would not leave me. He was also cheated on in his last relationship which really hurt him and he always says how he will never do that to others with how he felt. 

Here is what is really making me think that he may be cheating on me because I was on my phone early morning and his phone dinged when I looked at it I saw it was instagram. We both have full access to eachother phone and we use them often and even ask eachother to respond to messages if we aren’t close to the phone. 

I saw an account that messaged him named bunny. I had never heard of her and so I was reading their conversation and right off the bat he says his name and she responds but he then says” hi beautiful. Sorry I had to make another account lol” when I saw that I went to his account and did see that it’s a different one then what he uses this account just had a picture of his car while his other account has me and him posted all over it. He then goes on further to ask what he should wear for her and what her rates are. 

I’m so pissed when I found this but I didn’t know if I should have said something because we were having an entire day of plans we had to get done. He also goes on to say” I know that you get a lot of guys who flirt with you, but I’m gonna make it memorable” she of course laughed at it he also says “ I’m a keeper for sure. I may be a baby, but some guys just want a girl they can show their emotions too “ which is super interesting because ever time we have a fight it has to be over phone because he doesn’t know how to word things and I have made him talk to me in person a few times and we talk and we meet a common ground and set up a rule so that it doesn’t make the other person feel upset. 

He goes on more saying stuff like “I’m 23 and single” god now that I’m looking over the pics I took of their conversation I just say a text that said “ god damn I wish I could get off to your posts” I read her bio she’s a bikini barista and a stripper. The stripper that him and his work buddy’s are going to later this month and I think that he’s cheating on me. 

I am not sure when I should say somthing because we have had such great times and went through so much fuck I even helped him emotionally and physically when his father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung and bone cancer! 

He hasn’t gone to the club yet and I’m wondering if I should wait till after they to see if he does something more with her or if I should say it bow to stop him. I will not stop a man who physically cheats on me with another women. That means he doesn’t want me but now that it may be happening is hurting a lot. ",0,1731862604.0,relationship_advice,7,0.5,False

Babies absorb liquid food to grow, and the soft flesh of the adult esophagus absorbs solid food.

No matter how much damage is caused to both sides, the teeth can still be maintained by chewing gum, but the damage to the body is difficult.

I have tried dyeing my fingers, and the color gradually disappears after entering the pores. The plants will feel that the radio waves are different when people enter the room. It needs machine verification to let everyone know.

It shows that the human body still has great unknown potential. It is possible not to eat, but to contact food with thoughts to transform kinetic energy.

.

It is difficult to change habits after billions of years, but someone will always do experiments and research to find a better way to evolve.

As the body absorbs it, it will gradually fade away like stained paint. Whether we can avoid eating it remains to be seen through experiments. But how many people can avoid eating it?

.

Think about the Olympic Games, Formula One racing... these great achievements are made by the best human resources, using extremely high resources to push forward the ultimate progress.

Even if you don’t eat, there is still a long way to go in human progress. I am just passing through a relay station.

.

The economy is turning towards a general direction of development, and people are no longer just obsessed with eating, hoping that someone will recommend a fasting experiment.

Knowing that applying for a budget can take up to a year, the solicitation period is extended to two years.

.

Hopefully, there will be two companies or foundations, and they will be on opposing sides, like the Democratic and Republican parties,

To ensure the authenticity of the experiment, it is best to have three or more companies conduct the experiment together, and the entire process will be broadcast live on YouTube.

1gthug2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1gthug2/issues_with_supervisor_and_unsure_of_how_to/, Issues with supervisor and unsure of how to proceed (Masters student in Canada),"Hi everyone, 

I'm feeling super lost and frustrated right now and just hoping for some direction and/or advice. I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

I am a first year masters student (thesis-based) in Canada. Just started this program in September so I'm just over a couple months in and already having regrets. 

I first worked with my supervisor in my undergrad as a visiting student, doing an  research placement. I absolutely loved everything about it: the lab, the environment, the other grad students, the research, the supervisor, everything was amazing. And halfway through the placement the supervisor started asking me about coming back to do a masters after I graduated. At that point I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do after my undergrad so I was excited by the possibility. I took steps to inquire about all this beforehand. I took the grad students out for coffee away from the lab and got them to open up about their experiences, and they had only good things to say about everything, they were practically singing the supervisor's praises. So I thought about it some more and then halfway through my final year of undergrad I decided to commit to joining the lab for the masters and I accepted my offer a couple weeks later. I was super excited about this as I had found a project and research area I was super interested in and based on last year, I was convinced it would be an amazing experience.

 Then, in the spring, which was way past the deadline for almost every other grad program, I started to get the feeling that things weren't right at the lab. I had stayed in touch with some of the current grad students and they were telling me that the supervisor was incredibly absent, not giving them the support and guidance they need, making very questionable calls that were unfair to them etc. Around this time I also found something (cant give too many details as I dont wanna get doxxed) where the professor wrote something basically trash talking all the students. That's what got me really concerned. I had even wrote the supervisor some emails asking about what courses I should enrol in, other logistic etc. and every time I had only gotten very curt replies after having to follow up like 5 times lol. At this point there was only 2-3 months until I was starting grad school so I just hoped all this would go away once I started, but I had a horrible feeling. 

Now that I've moved across the country and started my masters I've never felt more drained, frustrated, and just angry about this whole situation. At my undergrad school I had the most amazing lab that I unfortunately was introduced to a little too late (after I'd committed to the other lab), and they were asking me to stay for a masters with them... but now I am here. The supervisor does not help me at all. As a brand new grad student, others in my classes are basically getting hand holding and then there is me, who is basically on my own all the time. My supervisor is so absent to the point where we he only even comes to campus about once a month. We never really even meet unless I force them to. I get absolutely no direction. And recently there was an ""incident"" where they mislead me into thinking certain things were okay (think writing wise - again dont want to give too much detail here). If it wasn't for the other grad students looking out for me I likely would have ended up in some horrible situations because of this supervisor. I feel like I can't trust them anymore. I no longer can ask them for direction or feedback because they either won't give it me or they will give me advice that is literally crazy.... I have no idea what happened to them or how they changed so much, no one else seems to know either. Maybe there is something going on in their life idk but it's severely affecting my ability to do anything here, especially as a brand new student. On top of this I found out that a lot of things that they should have told me before I accepted my offer were not communicated (many crucial things such as a change in my work, timelines, lab funding, etc etc). I feel cheated and so lost and it's adding so much stress and I don't know what to do here. 

  
Sorry that was long and I don't really know what I'm expecting here but wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and can give me advice as to how I should approach this?",1,1731862329.0,AskAcademia,0,1.0,False

I did a hard 80 minute bike ride beginning 9:20am. Reading about lingo score it says it doesn't count spikes 30 minutes before or after exercise. But it didn't neutralize this one (which admittedly started more than 30 minutes before I started exercising).

1gthtu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/micheljanseYT/comments/1gthtu8/researching_her_trips/,Researching her trips,"Ok, she is adamant about not researching ANYTHING before she travels. Her reasonings are bullshit to me but whatever. HOWEVER, throughout her travel vlogs, including her most recent Vermont vlog, she keeps saying “I did some research” or “I did some TikTok research” “Maps says there is this and that”. Like dude, this is RESEARCHING. What is she trying to avoid by researching before her trip if she’s going to research while she’s there anyway? She says she likes to go with the flow and see where the day takes her, but that’s never really the case. Before she leaves her hotel room, she looks up stuff. This is not “seeing where the day takes me,” that’s targeting exactly where you want to go. If she is going to look up things anyway, it’s better to do it before her trips to avoid what happened in Maine where almost everything was closed because it’s a seasonal spot. 

Also, her idea of “there is so much to do here” is almost always shopping and coffee shops, which is exactly and almost exclusively what she always does in her day-to-day life in CA. All she does is shopping, whether in brick and mortar stores or online, and when she travels she looks for the streets with shopping. Does she not get sick of shopping? 


Related but unrelated, is it just me who NEVER uses the built in Apple’s Maps app because it’s never accurate or up to date like Google Maps? I find it strange that she only uses Maps instead of Google Maps but it could just be a me thing. ",19,1731862282.0,micheljanseYT,4,0.95,False

Looking for some advice, particularly around locations and neighbourhoods when moving to San Diego, from the UK. Starting a new role in a few months time. Moving alone, as an early 30s male. Salary will be more than acceptable, and significantly greater than the UK, although not particularly high when compared to the area (approx $100k). 

Would love to hear advice from people who have done something similar. Looking for suitable areas, that would be close enough to the standard social life (coffee shops, gyms parks etc).. Don't want to be too secluded. Conscious however of living costs.

I had an important exam in the morning at 8 am, he was aware of this. His coming home woke me up and he was a dead weight in the bed taking up all the room and snoring, I couldn’t get back to sleep. I tried to gently ask him to move to the side but he didn’t wake up. I got increasingly frustrated so I shoved him until he woke up to tell him to sleep on the couch. He woke up in a drunken stupor and and started calling me names, telling me to shut up. Eventually he got up and started looking for his keys to leave. I grabbed his keys because it was not safe for him to drive. He spent the next hour+ looking for them, telling me he was breaking up with me, and it even escalated to him throwing and breaking items on my nightstand, turning over the night stand. After a few hours, he made himself coffee and exhausted from it all, I gave him the keys. I went to my exam on 3 hours of sleep. 

He called me later that day to apologize, said he felt extremely ashamed, and had little recollection of what happened. He was clearly just as distressed as I was about the whole ordeal. I accepted his forgiveness but now looking back I wish I had let it sit a little longer. We had been talking about living together but this behaviour has completely shut the door on that idea which is heartbreaking. He already spends a lot of time at my place. And I need my focus on the end of my semester and supporting my mom. 

We have a high conflict relationship but we were doing better in the last few months. Personal stressors in my life (mom has metastatic cancer, changing careers, back in school while working) have admittedly made me more stressed and emotionally sensitive / drained. This is not related to his blow up, but just to provide context that he might have had some unconscious resentment of the high level of support I’ve been asking of him. Things have never escalated like this in the past. Is this something we can move past? I’m feeling so jarred and unsure on what to do next. Keep in mind this is one chapter of many in an otherwise good and happy relationship. We love each other and I haven’t felt close to someone like this in a decade, so walking away is not an easy choice. ",1,1731862220.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I discovered it when trying to tighten up a syncopated bass line that wasn't lining up in the piano roll grid as expected.

https://i.redd.it/u12z463krh1e1.gif

Fixing the loops is easy, but now all the other parts of the track start a bit late. The artist has offered to rerecord all their parts but I'm hoping to avoid that.

At first I thought I'd just nudge the rest of the tracks ahead 97 ticks in time every 4 bars but thought maybe Flex Time might be the better solution -- am I right in thinking that I can build a tempo map based on the fixed loops and automatically solve my problem?

There's not much out here in the way of amenities but it's an absolutely beautiful place. I am pretty outdoorsy and can't wait to explore. Here's the problem. Our second car broke down and we won't have the funds to get a new one until our old house sells and the housing market is trash for sellers right now so who knows when that's going to happen. My husband leaves for work at 5am. So while I could technically drop him off at work that'd mean getting both of my kids up at 430am. I have a 2 year old and an 8 year old. I'd be perfectly fine letting the 8 year old sleep but my 2 year old is a horrible sleeper. She still doesn't sleep through the night so including a big adventure at 4am would honestly cancel out any freedom having the car would allow me. Toddlers suck. Moving sucks. I had a wonderful routine. Places to go and get the energy out. Places I could get a coffee and sit and let her go wild. Although not having a car at the old house would have put me in this same position. 

 The house is beautiful. Where we live is great. I just feel so stuck. And stuck with a two year old. I know I can sit on Pinterest and put together fun activities to do inside that will ultimately just last for 30 minutes and then I'll have to clean up. We go for two walks every day but it's not enough. I am stuck in this house and it's driving me nuts. My husband doesn't get home until 5 and it's dark by then so where am I going to go? To the grocery store? No thank you. He does get time off every other weekend which has basically become two days of me cramming in everything that needs to get done that's outside the house. 

We go for short hikes by the beach which is awesome but if I had a freaking car I'd be by the beach every morning. I know it's all temporary but I'm getting depressed and irritated and angry and short tempered with my kids. I'm touched out. I'm tired of all the noise. My husband takes on the kids when he gets home. He is great. I don't know I just feel trapped in this stupid boring routine that involves way to much Netflix and I don't see any way out of it.

do i, very slowly, go through french news articles and translate it word by word with google translate and write it down, then try to re-learn those words?

It continued for two weeks and I switched to a BRAT diet to minimize the number of bowel movements and dehydration. Cut out caffeine because it was causing cramps. Stopped breastfeeding (😢 which was a bummer) because it was just too much. 

Yesterday, my movements become suddenly normal. Like 1-2 times a day. Just had my first cup of caffeinated coffee and no issues. I’m not yet on prednisone and no change in my meds.

I'm naturally empathetic and patient so it's not anything out of the ordinary to have conversations and interactions with them. 

I'm good at cleaning/disinfecting/organizing and am able to stay on track with my routine and help out the aides when needed. I never perform direct patient care as I am not properly trained and could suffer serious consequences, but I often get supplies ready at the bedside or run and grab things like a new outfit, socks, or linens when the aide has their hands full. I'll answer call lights if it's something like ice water or coffee so the aide can focus on the more important stuff. 

I've been getting asked almost daily if I've considered nursing because of my caring nature. I always say no, I'm actually in school for social work and would rather help in other ways. Also the number one thing I hear from CNAs is the excessive toll this job takes on their body and back. I could not sustain it due to physical/medical reasons but sometimes it's easier to just say no I'm in school for something else :) with that being said I have nothing but the upmost respect for anyone in all levels of nursing!

My mom trivializing my feelings after I had something traumatic happen.

My dad screaming at me, because the house isn’t clean. (My mom has hoarding tendencies, and we never lived in a clean house.)

My dad guilt-tripping me into going to play disc golf, despite me being very sick for a week and not even playing. I carry the bag and walk around.

My mom crying about me planning to order a formal dress online, because she thinks I’m “stealing away an opportunity for us to bond.”

My mom constantly insisting I let my brother use a laptop my boyfriend let me borrow, despite the fact he explicitly said only I could use the laptop, which is something I explained.

My dad screaming at me that the sink was clogged. We learned that it was clogged with coffee grounds, and I don’t drink coffee.

Both my parents yelling at me about voting for Joe Biden every time he announced a policy they didn’t like. I didn’t vote in 2020, and they know that.

My dad pushing me in a restaurant, because I wasn’t walking fast enough.

My mom telling me my brother is just being annoying when I expressed that him touching me on my shoulder has made me uncomfortable, and he’s not listening to me.

My mom telling me if she had her way, I wouldn’t have moved back in.

My dad yelling at me that the dog wasn’t fed, and then saying she’s not my dog when a friend wanted to do a doggy play date.

Market data indicates that fewer than 100 investment-quality 6 carat diamonds enter the global market annually, creating significant appreciation potential.

Lab-grown alternatives have transformed this museum-grade segment, offering identical specifications at $17,000-$20,000 – a paradigm-shifting 80% reduction that's revolutionizing the collector landscape. Analysis shows 6 carat diamonds achieve a remarkable 300%-400% price-per-carat premium over 4 carat stones, reflecting their extreme scarcity and institutional demand.

This definitive buying  guide provides sophisticated acquisition strategies for the 6 carat market, including provenance documentation, long-term appreciation projections, and expert insights for both museum-grade natural specimens and premium lab-grown alternatives in this pinnacle category.

# Bottom Line

Here's what you need to know:

* A 6 carat diamond is a rare and impressive gem, typically weighing 1.2 grams with a diameter of 11.75-12mm - take that into consideration as this diamond can feel heavy on the finger.
* These stones come with a hefty price tag, often exceeding $100,000 for balanced-quality natural diamonds. 
* Lab-grown options offer significant savings ($17,000-$20,000 range)
* Choose settings carefully to enhance and protect the stone
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

I'm looking for that one person that I just totally click with and connect with. Like I genuinely wanna feel so connected it feels like we are the same person!!

I'm a busy college student, spending most of the year in Southern Ohio. It gets pretty lonely, and honestly I just don't have that strong connection to anyone! I've always been searching for it :')

Anyway, here's some random stuff about me, something that gives a general idea of who I am, and maybe my actual clone (in personality) will somehow stumble onto reddit and onto my post!:

- I'm queer, I've got ADHD and anxiety but it just makes me absolutely cracked and I've been told I'm very funny so yeah! My humor is actually insane, and I suspect I may be a lil autistic but ahhhh it's just me being extra quirky 😼

- I absolutely LOVE nature, and everything involving it, I love plants, animals, being outside, I genuinely have this connection to nature and the universe, and recently I've been trying to find some spiritual connection with it? Religion has always been something I've struggled it, and I've been really trying to find myself and my connection to the world and what it means :') I think WAY too much, so typical religions.. they can be tough for me-

- With that, I'm really passionate about the climate crisis and the environment!! It is DEVESTATING to see what's happening out there, but I try to just enjoy what I currently can with nature

- I like reading, poetry, video games, shows/movies (currently watching Beastars!), walks outside, tea/coffee, listening to music 24/7, science, space, anddd recently I've started getting into pokemon cards! :3 I currently just open virtual packs using Pokémon TCG Pocket because I'm broke currently LMFAO but I want to start collecting physical cards very soon >:3

People say I've got golden retriever energy, I get hyper and really excited sometimes! I'm also an introvert though since too many people and social stuff can tire me out :')

Also, you could also say I'm a furry I guess? I mostly just like the art and silly little fursona drawings, and I chronically use :3 

I dream of one day living in either Oregon or Washington, just somewhere in a blue state where I can keep my rights lol and also be close to a lot of forests and nature to explore!! My dream home is something rustic and durable, while also owning land to grow my own vegetables and be self sustaining in this INSANE world- (maybe unrealistic goal? but that's what a dream home is for!) Also, I really want a golden retriever :D

Phew! If you've read all that and you're still here, here's what I'm looking for!

I'm basically looking for someone really similar to me who I can connect with, talk about literally anything with, text, call, hangout with, play video games, watch movies, explore nature, get coffee or food with, etc. literally whatever! I wanna mutually rant about climate change and the devastating political situation of the country and controversial topics that we both share the same opinions on and just all the stuff like that! 

Hopefully you'd be patient, funny, not insane, actually able to text and communicate properly as if it's a conversation instead of that really painful dry texting that feels like I'm texting a robot 😭😭 also like.. I hope you smell really good and also like having a clean space, because I CANNOT deal with super messy or gross spaces or bad smells- I've got a really sensitive nose :'D

Aside from that, I figure the right person will just magically find me 🙏 (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU)

SO! If you felt like you really related and connected with what I've written, send me a chat with an introduction of yourself and who you are as a person!! I'll be here :3",1,1731860974.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

My parents got him as a puppy just after they both retired from work, a year after i had started University.

He was an amazing dog, and was there for us through a lot - e.g. did not leave my, my mum and my dad's side after we were all recovering from multiple separate serious surgeries / injuries, there through all of COVID, and helped my mum and dad as both me and my sister moved out of the family home permanently.

My Mum and Dad also moved into our family home \~3 months before my sibling and I were born, and so this is now the first time that they are alone in their house, which they are also coming to terms with.

They are very active for 65 year olds, and still regularly walk, take part in church activities etc.

I am obviously devastated about losing our wonderful dog (when does the crying stop? I miss him so much and wish i could hug him or love him one more time, it doesn't quit seem real - [this was one his favourite places to lay](https://imgur.com/a/UdqwQVZ) with me), but I am equally upset to see how much this has impacted on my Mum and Dad too.

We all got together this weekend and looked at old photos and videos of him which helped, and they have planted some plants in the garden on top of where they buried him along with a little seating area, so they can still have their morning coffee with him.

But is there any advice anyone could give as to how i could help them through this tough time? (Very aware i am also probably projecting their own sadness as a placeholder for my own!)

It's Week 11, and both teams are desperately trying to prove they're more than just average. The Broncos, sitting at a lukewarm 5-5, are favored by 2 points, which is about as exciting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. Meanwhile, the Falcons are soaring slightly higher with a 6-4 record and a knack for covering spreads on the road like they're trying to impress their in-laws.

Kirk Cousins is leading the charge for the Falcons, having thrown for a whopping 2,634 yards this season. He's got Drake London on speed dial, who’s been catching everything but the common cold, with 58 receptions for 649 yards and 6 touchdowns. On the other side, the Broncos are relying on their defense to keep them in the game, allowing just 17.7 points per game. Bo Nix, the Broncos' QB, is still figuring out how to adult in the NFL, but hey, we all have our growing pains.

Now, let's talk bets. The Falcons are priced at 2.1 to win, which means they're the underdogs here. But remember, underdogs win about 35% of the time in football, and with their road warrior mentality, they might just pull off a surprise. So, if you're feeling adventurous, the Falcons at 2.1 could be your ticket to glory.

As for the over/under, it's set at 44.5 points. With the Broncos' stingy defense and the Falcons' ability to occasionally forget how to score, the under at 1.93 seems like a safe bet. But hey, if you like living on the edge, go ahead and root for a shootout.

In conclusion, my best bet is to take the Falcons to cover the spread. They're unbeaten as 2-point underdogs or more on the road, and with Cousins and London in sync, they might just send the Broncos packing. So grab your popcorn, place your bets, and let's see if the Falcons can fly high in Denver.",1,1731860260.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

**TLDR; I believe she left invisible strings for us to find between the Anti-Hero, Bejeweled, and Karma music videos that tie to the unique occurrences during the Midnights Mayhem with Me episodes which lead us right to the ending. The Man Wall may need to be read as a snake and butterfly with the death and rebirth cycle leading to a recut version of Miss Americana, this time as a tell all in the form of The Heartbreak Prince.**

First, a refresher on the unique MMWM episodes, then a dissection of attire in the related music videos, and finally how I think they all relate.

# Midnights Mayhem with Me

**9/21/22 Episode One: Track 13 - Mastermind**

As she starts the series she says, ""It's me, hi. I know that I have a habit of dropping cryptic clues and Easter Eggs when giving you information about new music and I am not here to deny that but I am here to defy that."" Taylor then pulls out Track 13 - Mastermind. 

One of the definitions of 'defy' is to *appear to be challenging (someone) to do or prove something*. 

We know Taylor isn't going to leave this order up to chance, so what are we supposed to pick up on? What's she proving? And what's the deal with the unique phone positions during the episodes?

[The 4 times Taylor held the phone differently than the other episodes](https://preview.redd.it/tqvo3q1yfc1e1.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=8525ef8d38205321edb6783fd53f2f6376431ead)

**9/23/22 Episode Two: Track 8 - Vigilante Shit**

Taylor pulls out Track 8 - Vigilante Shit. While wearing a green cardigan with daisies on (or up) her sleeves, Taylor holds the phone upside down for the first time. 

Taylor ends the only song she wrote alone on the Midnight album by saying *I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends*. *Don't get sad, get even. So on the weekends I don't dress for friends. Lately I've been dressing for revenge.*

This is relevant for multiple reasons. First, she is telling us she knows where this is headed and how it will end. We can also interpret this as, ending how we started - using her tried and true queer flagging imagery of daisies. Lastly, the increase in pap walks and choice clothing in said weekend pap walks can tell us a story of how she will take back the her own story - her revenge.

[Daisies up her sleeve](https://preview.redd.it/4puswr8jgc1e1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad27e986df93389952b30cc15c413b4e8af9897)

Vigilante Shit doesn't have a music video for us to analyze, but I think the 2023 Spotify Artist of the Year ending is interesting. I found [some ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18byw9b/extra_person_in_spotify_global_artist_video/)[analysis ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1fjy0zz/are_these_people_the_two_taylors/)but not a ton on our sub. I believe that right after the clock strikes midnight, we see Speak Now in the Vigilante Shit chair with the MMWM phone across from Fearless. There are theories that Taylor tried to flag louder during Speak Now and was shut down from management. So, is the Fearless Mirrorball trying to stop Speak Now Vigilante from making the call?

[Speak Now holding the MMWM phone during 2023 Spotify Artist of the Year](https://preview.redd.it/4m3j8elw1d1e1.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cc2f86f6d2a6573a0505c07d23466a8740f8e26)

**10/3/22 Episode Six: Track 3 - Anti-Hero**

Taylor holds the phone upside down while announcing Anti-Hero. She wears a shirt from Gigi Hadid's brand called ""Layer Me Up Vest in Steel"". Steel is likely the color, but it invokes interesting imagery. '""To steel oneself"" is an idiom meaning gathering courage in preparation for something difficult or unpleasant to come.

[The second time Taylor wears an item from Gigi's brand. The first 12 days prior with the Shrunken Polo during the Episode 4, Track 6 - Midnight Rain  ](https://preview.redd.it/5rye9kcxgc1e1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd14ae1bc06066186b54f116683f8327dc64a102)

**10/5/22 Episode Seven: Track 9 - Bejeweled**

Taylor uses her dominant hand for the first time in Midnights Mayhem with Me while announcing Bejeweled. Reminder that Taylor is actually right handed even though she plays the guitar with her left hand and can sign her name with both hands. TSS does not have the this sweater identified. However, the gold hammered arrow-through-the-heart earrings with a blue sapphire in the middle were also worn during the March 2021 ""You All Over Me"" announcement, the first Fearless TV vault song, and during the announcement on Folklore: The Long Pond Studios going to Disney Plus on Good Morning America in April 2021. 

[These earrings are from one of her favorite brands, but these 3 appearances throughout multiple album announcements is interesting](https://preview.redd.it/v01s00o2lc1e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=28c565e71b0e202db566b21f6cecc5272351597a)

**10/7/22 at 1am Episode Nine: Track 5 You're On You're Own Kid**

After dropping Lavender Haze at 12am, Taylor uses her right hand for the second and final time announcing You're On You're Own, Kid. TSS does not have the sweater identified. 

[YOYOK track title announcement](https://preview.redd.it/uyn0q05jmc1e1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=9242493ee0ade78215a14b7c425212121e82b8f8)

# Music Videos

**Anti-Hero**

The Anti-Hero music video dropped 8 hours after the song and album's release on 10/21/22. Before I dive in, I think it's interesting that the very first play of Anti-Hero was on 1/12/23 with The 1975 while wearing a particularly mirrorball like dress. Very performanceartlor of her.

First, the casket. Of all the caskets in the world for Taylor to choose from, she chooses the Titan Casket from the company's Orion series.

[L to R: The Orion Series casket, Orion depiction of the Hunter, constellation best visible in January, the brightness of each star](https://preview.redd.it/y3sgc731qc1e1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c09b88a7eb053d62f26cdbcd43c889b9a96bc95)

In mythology, the Orion constellation was named after a giant hunter. He was a hunter for the king but the king later blinded and exiled him after he fell in love with the king's daughter. He then travelled eastward towards the sun god to regain his sight. That already is invoking themes and imagery we know well - hunting giants in the Mass Movement theory, being exiled for falling in love with someone you shouldn't, going towards daylight for redemption.

In the constellation itself, Orion's 7 brightest stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped pattern. In Orion's 'three star' belt, the middle star isn't a star at all - it's a nebula (and one of the most studied in our universe). Many of the stars that make up the Orion constellation aren't stars either, they're hot blue super giants.

So again, we get more repeated imagery that we see throughout the Era's tour and Taylor's work of [supernovas](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gctc0s/new_surprise_song_dresses_karma_is_a_supernova/), exploding stars, and burning things down. I personally believe the ""Koi Fish"" surprise song dress is one part [kelvin ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gfvgor/three_taylor_theory_part_2_fortnight_music_video/)scale, one part two Taylors and orange/blue imagery we get in the Fortnight music video.

[Orion's Nebula](https://preview.redd.it/ybiv9lxcsc1e1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1770494d0669a0403f08ee1939af229cd214651)

The next part of the casket is within the [music video itself ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kbLwvqugk&t=152s)(3:01 time stamp).

[One son thinks there is a secret message and looks at this image and finger guns. As her other son reads the post script Taylor peeks out and then also looks at the graphic exactly at 3:13](https://preview.redd.it/cmjgex9puc1e1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f82721594d3525feab741fa267bcae9e5ed4d2)

After her kids/heirs learn they are only getting 13 cents, they look to see if there's a secret message. Right as one reads ""PS: There is no secret encoded message that means something else. Love, Taylor"", the camera spans to the casket where Taylor peaks out and then looks to the large picture of her with her 11 cats [(or 11 albums)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gdlsxe/karma_is_coming_back_around/). 

But, exactly 369 days later (or 123), the Bejeweled music video drops with the Marie Antoinette, [ghosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1fbpgrd/shes_telling_a_story_about_ghosting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and castle imagery. So, I do think there is an intentional egg there and potentially even doing double duty for Karma is a Cat.

Next I want to talk about some jewelry and brands that have only been worn once.

We have been seeing 'Sunday best' or 'Sunday dresses' in this recent era during pap shots. They first re-appear in her wardrobe in the Anti-Hero music video (besides a few skirt names during the folklore photoshoots). 

Taylor^(TM)  wears earrings called Juicy Sunday Hoops in Lime Green. These earrings are by the brand Misho; this is the first time she's worn something by them. The second and, so far, final time comes 2 years later in the Karma music video.

[Taylor the Brand in Sunday hoops, 'Sunday Dress' on double date night with TK and the Mahomes, 'Sunday Checkered Draped Corset' at TK football game, 'Sunday Striped Cotton Dress' at dinner with Zoe, Jerrod, and Ronan 366 days after TK show in Buenos Aires](https://preview.redd.it/me7o5dpd7d1e1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6bb0d2a6622337bce6860a5dbb9854ab1999386)

Taylor^(TM) also wears the Bejeweled Bracelet, another connection point, and putting distance between the various version of Taylors.

[Taylor the Brand Jewelry in the Anti-Hero Music Video](https://preview.redd.it/40yngw728d1e1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15c588adc85d2ab78ded2806e13564130fd70df)

The next jewelry is from a brand she only wears this singular time - ByChari. Right after Taylor is shot and tries to cover up how she is bleeding glitter, we get the Alice in Wonderland imagery. We see her wearing two rings with the names of two known friends and women who have come up as potential muses - Zoe and Lily. After this, I looked with an even finer tooth comb for any other name or connection to other theorized muses. I didn't find any.

[The only time Taylor has worn this brand she wears two rings with the names of two theorized muses](https://preview.redd.it/okxxv3oq8d1e1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b19e9ce46c6cd4c13c82fd6f2a2bc9e6a321e65)



**Bejeweled Music Video**

The next music video Taylor releases is also the next unique MMWM occurrence - Bejeweled. I have four interesting connections here.

While winning Queen Pat's approval, we see portraits of Zoe (contributor to Lavender Haze and Karma) and Sam Dew (contributor to I Don't Wanna Live Forever, Lavender Haze, and Glitch). We have the Zoe link above with the ring and then will again below with being a Karma contributor. Sam's connections seem to relate to Lily with both the I Don't Wanna Live Forever single and the Lavender Haze music video being dropped on Lily's birthday.

[Left to right: Zoe Kravitz, Pat McGrath, Sam Dew](https://preview.redd.it/zgk8mk05bd1e1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a386449d3a3f9b083f0a726fca923006c0dd7a3)

The lingerie she wears after she wins the contest and before she ghosts is actually called Pearl Marie. So the theories about the Marie Antoinette of it all are further pushed by Taylor wearing this specific set. 

[Pearl Marie 3-Piece Set from Trashy Lingerie in the Bejeweled music video](https://preview.redd.it/gidt6u5uad1e1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0864bc09d9e04f54f6d5ac4398658fe92961cc)

Last callout for Bejeweled is wearing a brand only once - Karma el Khalil. This obviously caught my attention because karma. I figured it was a costume jewelry brand that she used specifically to egg. But no, it's a well known company. If you go to their website, you'll see the actresses and artists below.. and then Taylor in the lingerie. That almost feels more intentional than if it had been an unknown brand.

[Karma el Khalil website and then Taylor wearing a ring from their brand in the Bejeweled music video](https://preview.redd.it/q4klngtyed1e1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=b89ded1aa26a683c6f272d97f898f876a5315a9b)



**Karma Music Video**

Here we go slightly off-script. 

Our third music video is the Karma music video released 5/26/23 - 247 days (123.5) after the first MMWM episode of Mastermind.

There is so much we could go into with the Karma mv imagery including Dorothy, Alice, twin flames, folklore connections (love you to moon and to Saturn), and more. But I'm here to focus on what I'm good at which is data and patterns.

After Taylor is Lady Justice, we flip to the underworld where we see the Versace brand Medusa appear in a music video for the first time since The Man in 2020. I go more into Versace Medusa [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gpl133/recent_fashion_medusa_horserelated_items_and/).

[Versace Medusa: YNTCD and Lover 2019 VMA performance, The Man music video 2020, Karma music video 2023 ](https://preview.redd.it/v6w4tq9zjd1e1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=47ad4718734594d7c99d7678cff57f4eba010aaf)

When we flip right-side back, we're seemingly in Oz with possibly the castle from Bejeweled in the background.

As Dorothy, Taylor wears the same Veronica 55 Patent Leather Pumps that she wore in the I Bet You Think About Me music video which debuted 11/15/21. As Ren on TikTok says, it always goes back to Red.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1gs20wc/comment/lxbfeit/), OP reminded me that ""the silver shoes she wears during ""I Can Do It With a Broken Heart"" and the subsequent surprise songs are ALSO an OZ reference. In the book, Dorothy has silver shoes, not ruby slippers.""

[The Ruby Slippers that will take her home: Karma MV in 2023 and IBYTAM MV in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ybmth5y6md1e1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=d38b099174ac72b34179e838a4c96f2f5ee60991)

Then, we get the hourglass imagery - 2 years after we learn about the Orion constellation hourglass pattern from the Orion series casket in the Anti-Hero music video.

[Hourglass in Karma MV 2023, Orion 'hourglass' from Orion Casket Anti-Hero MV 2021](https://preview.redd.it/6hi0hlmand1e1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=18c90d9acb47e5ec36d6536438a49f29b9cb364a)

Then, Taylor shatters the glass cage (lightbulb) that she's in. This is the second, and so far, final appearance of the brand Misho (the earrings Taylor^(TM) wore in Anti-Hero). And just like Karma el Khalil, this is a well known brand so seeing the image of Taylor in a lightbulb surrounded by other artists and actresses feels noticeably out of place.

[Misho Webpage showing artists and actresses, and then Taylor before she shatters the glass bulb](https://preview.redd.it/f9esae8cmd1e1.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac259ae5295eca52231596c74dae9010457b4770)

# How They Relate

I think I've shown enough evidence to see a clear line from the Midnights Mayhem with Me flipped and right hand episodes through the Midnights music videos that visually show the narrative she's been weaving throughout her lyrics for years.

I believe the flipped phones of Vigilante Shit and Anti-Hero give us insight into how she has planned burning it down and some insight into the multiple Taylors.

I believe the right-hand phones take that one step further with Bejeweled and You're On You're Own, Kid. Using her dominant hand, the mirror image of what she used for the rest of the track titles, I think we see more of True Taylor. We don't have a YOYOK to analyze but we don't need to. We've can read the lyrics and see how often and what mashups she's included with it during the Era's Tour.

Summary:  

* First flipped MMWM phone, Vigilante Shit: daisies sweater, only solo written song on the Midnights album, I don't start shit but I know how it ends, Speak Now on the Vigilante Shit chair in the 2023 Spotify Global Artist of the Year holding the MMWM phone
* Second flipped MMWM phone, Anti-Hero: two jewelry call outs to potential muses, Taylor^(TM) wears a 'Sunday best' and a Bejeweled bracelet, the Orion series casket with The Hunter, hourglass, and supernova connections, 'no eggs' but 369 days later Bejeweled music video drops with lots of eggs
* First right hand MMWM phone, Bejeweled: Marie Antoinette imagery 'confirmed' with Pearl Marie lingerie, Zoe Kravitz and Sam Dew appearances, wearing a Karma ring, potentially Fearless in the castle with Speak Now's Koi Fish stain glass above the balcony (recall a lot of us theorize Fearless but specifically SN the label kept her from flagging more so this makes sense after arguing with SN Vigilante Shit above)
* Second right hand MMWM phone, YOYOK: self explanatory?
* Karma MV: Drops 247 (123.5) after first episode of MMWM - Mastermind, shattering the glass bulb while wearing the same brand that Taylor^(TM) wore in Anti-Hero, Dorothy's shoes match IBYTAM shoes, Alice imagery recalls Alice imagery in Anti-Hero, bejeweled bracelet but not the same one as the bejeweled bracelet in the Bejeweled music video, coffee clock striking midnight between 1989 and Rep nails

This is where the fully flushed out part where I'm pretty confident in my analysis ends.

# Bonus: Where Does It Lead?

I think Karma gives us the key back to The Man wall.

Tiktok user [k8teebug](https://www.tiktok.com/@k8teebug/video/7437864843480223007) suggests looking at the posters on the wall separately from the re-records. If the vertical portion of the butterfly is new work and the wings are the re-records, what would the posters on the wall symbolize? She suggests it's more of the imagery we've gotten before around death and rebirth with snakes and butterflies. From that, she and others theorized Taylor may release a recut tell-all version of Miss Americana, this time as the Heartbreak Prince.

I want to take that one step further and say that in the Karma music video, we have a similar clock to the image we got of Exile Ends in the Bejeweled music video. So, if we meet her at midnight, between the 1989 and Reputation nails, could a documentary tell all be between those two re-records, and at the end of the yellow brick road?",9,1731860023.0,GaylorSwift,1,0.85,False
