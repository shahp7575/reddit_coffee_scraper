Hello fellow Redditors,

I‚Äôm currently in a bit of a dilemma, so confused and need some honest advice.

I (35M) recently matched with a girl online on Hinge (33F).

We instantly hit it off with good vibes and lots of long messaging.  We shared lots of similar interests.  It was evident she was engaged and investing lots of effort by the length and tone of her messages.  

The to/fro messaging for about a week got to the point where it was just too much to discuss and reply - so I proposed we meet for a first date which she said definitely yes! 

We hit off well on the first date (lunch) and the hours just flew by.  Coffee turned to cocktails.  There and then, I said I enjoyed my time with her and proposed we meet again for a second date in a week.  She gave a definite yes and she proposed a time and day there itself.  I paid the whole lunch bill despite her insistence which she was very grateful for.  

I got the second date (dinner) all planned out and locked in for her.  I got her phone number too after the first date so we moved our conversations outside of Hinge and there was lots more batter right up to the second date.  Second date came and we again hit off and it lasted twice as long as the first date (4hrs!) till the restaurant had to kindly kick us out!  

I might have awkwardly caught her off guard towards the very end when I asked if she had any future (~5yr) life plans or goals or what she wanted out of a healthy relationship - which she shyly said she didn‚Äôt really plan that far, and I quickly tried reassuring her it is perfectly normal to be unsure as lots of people are.  

I regret now bringing a deep question to kill an otherwise light-hearted date but I was just trying to see how well we both aligned.   

When the time came to pay, she again insisted on splitting but this time with a rather non-negotiable ‚Äòdo not push me‚Äô look.  Not to offend and respect her for being an independent professional individual, I hesitantly agreed despite objecting that I should cover everything as I asked her out for the second date.  

Before parting, she said she hoped things will work out between us.

After the second date, she texted me when she got home safe and thanked me for a good evening and not to worry about the bill split, and said I paid for the 1st date anyway.  

I texted her a few days later for a more low-key and active weekend walk and brunch as a change - she apologised saying she was busy but ‚Äúcould‚Äù (key word?) be keen for another time in a very friendly text.  

I‚Äôve just recently texted her again if she wanted to catch up but this time, I‚Äôve not heard from her for nearly a week

I see she‚Äôs been active in social media so that rules out an unfortunate tragedy such as a medical event.  

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks right up to this point from when we first matched on Hinge - pretty good going I‚Äôd think considering we‚Äôve had 2 dates so far after a week of long messaging.  

I‚Äôm really torn, confused and I need some advice on some lingering confusions in my mind:
1. Did I kill our vibes by asking a deep question about future goals in life in date#2?  From past dating advice, this seemed like a pertinent question to ask early on to see compatibility before getting too far.
2. Was a silent red flag to me her ‚Äònon-negotiable‚Äô insistence on paying for the second date? (knowing that she didn‚Äôt want to owe me anything when she had silently decided this would be our last date)
3. Her hope after our second (and last) date that things will work out between us - is this something people say out of courtesy or is it genuine?
4. It looks like she has ghosted me.  Should I send a follow up text, or give her a bit more time / space or just move on?
5. And the most confusing is that we instantly clicked from the moment we matched and we were never short of lighthearted stuff to discuss.  But I guess, if she didn‚Äôt feel the ‚Äòspark‚Äô, all these doesn‚Äôt really matter?  To be honest, there wasn‚Äôt much physical touching or kissing other than hugs and some flirty looks (I felt we were both reserved and both felt it was rather too early with only 2 dates so far for more intimate physical expressions) 

This is the first girl I‚Äôve matched where we both had conversations so long and engaging (not one sided) and where time just fades.  But I guess the saying goes that good conversations does not always equal a romantic spark üò¢

Thanks for making it this far!  Sorry for the long story, any advice or thoughts is most appreciated!

Work drained me, gym sessions were half-hearted, and by the time I got home, I just wanted to sit down with a show on while scrolling through my phone. A friend of mine who works as a pharmacist suggested I try this supplement called EndoPump that he uses. It's a natural aphrodisiac that's supposed to improve your overall energy as well. I looked into it and was a bit skeptical at first but saw all the supporting studies they had along with the money back guarantee so thought it was worth a shot.

A couple of weeks in, my wife started commenting on how I seemed ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù At first, I thought she was talking about my mood or how I was doing things around the house. But she meant everything. Her words, I was more present, more engaged, and let‚Äôs just say, more confident in ways I hadn‚Äôt been for a while if you know what I mean.

That‚Äôs when it hit me, I really did feel different. My energy wasn‚Äôt just better; it was consistent. I wasn‚Äôt crashing mid-afternoon, and I wasn't getting my coffee cravings. My workouts improved, too, heavier lifts and longer sessions where I wasn't quitting on my self during sets. But the biggest win? Feeling like myself again, the version of me I thought was long gone due to age or the stresses of life.

The best part? It wasn‚Äôt just me noticing. My wife‚Äôs appreciation was proof enough that this stuff was working. Posting this for anyone else who's in the same position that I was, I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but it works for me.

1gutmu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1gutmu4/my_experience_with_muama_ryoko_wifi_a_gamechanger/,My Experience with Muama Ryoko WiFi: A Game-Changer or Just Another Gadget?,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of buzz about **Muama Ryoko portable WiFi**, and since I‚Äôve been using it for a few months now, I thought I‚Äôd share my honest experience. If you‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs worth it, stick around‚ÄîI‚Äôll cover everything from setup to performance, and even a few unexpected quirks.

# Why I Decided to Try Muama Ryoko WiFi

Let me start by saying I‚Äôm a bit of a travel junkie. Whether it‚Äôs road trips across the country or hopping on a plane to explore a new country, staying connected has always been a challenge. Public WiFi is often slow and unreliable, and using my phone‚Äôs hotspot drains the battery *fast*. Not to mention those hefty international roaming fees.

I stumbled across **Ryoko portable WiFi** when searching for a reliable travel solution. The promise of **fast internet in over 76 countries** sounded too good to be true. But after reading a few **Muama Ryoko reviews**, I decided to give it a shot.

# The Setup Process: Easier Than I Expected

One thing I appreciated right away was how simple the setup was. The device comes with a pre-installed SIM card, so there‚Äôs no need to hunt for one yourself. All I had to do was:

1. **Turn on the device** using the power button.
2. Scan the **QR code** with my phone to connect.
3. Start browsing with secure, fast internet.

Even if you‚Äôre not tech-savvy, the **Ryoko WiFi setup** is incredibly straightforward. My parents, who struggle with most gadgets, were able to use it without any problems.

# Performance: Does It Live Up to the Hype?

The big question is, of course: **Does Muama Ryoko WiFi deliver?** Here‚Äôs what I found:

# Speed

* In urban areas, I consistently got download speeds of up to **150 Mbps**. Streaming HD videos, downloading files, and video calling all worked without a hitch.
* In more remote locations, the speeds were slower but still usable. For instance, while camping in a rural area, I managed to get decent speeds for browsing and emails.

# Connection Stability

One of my favorite things about **Ryoko WiFi** is its stability. Unlike my phone‚Äôs hotspot, which sometimes drops connections, Ryoko maintained a steady signal. I tested it with up to 8 devices at once (phones, laptops, tablets), and it worked seamlessly.

# Battery Life

Another pleasant surprise was the battery life. The device lasted around **12-15 hours** on a single charge, which was perfect for long travel days. Plus, the USB-C charging port made it super convenient to recharge quickly.

# What Makes Muama Ryoko Stand Out?

Here‚Äôs what I think sets **Ryoko portable WiFi** apart from other options:

1. **Global Coverage**: It works in over **76 countries**, covering Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and even parts of Africa. This was a lifesaver during my recent trip to Japan and Australia.
2. **Secure Internet**: The device creates a private, WPA2-encrypted WiFi network, which means no more worrying about hackers when using public WiFi at airports or coffee shops.
3. **Cost Savings**: Say goodbye to roaming fees! The pre-installed SIM card worked like a charm, and topping up data online was straightforward.

If you‚Äôre curious about the country coverage, you can check the full list [here](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

# What About the Downsides?

No device is perfect, and **Ryoko WiFi** has a few quirks worth mentioning:

1. **Initial Data Limit**: The pre-installed SIM comes with only **500MB** of free data. It‚Äôs enough to test the device, but you‚Äôll need to top up for extended use.
2. **Device Colors**: It‚Äôs available only in white, which might not appeal to everyone. I‚Äôd personally love a black version for a sleeker look.
3. **No Built-In Screen**: Unlike some high-end portable WiFi devices, Ryoko doesn‚Äôt have a screen to show data usage or signal strength. You‚Äôll need to monitor these via an app or your browser.

# How Does Ryoko Compare to a Phone‚Äôs Hotspot?

I initially wondered why I‚Äôd need a separate device when my phone could double as a hotspot. After using Ryoko, here‚Äôs what I noticed:

* **Battery Drain**: Using your phone as a hotspot eats up your battery quickly, while Ryoko lasts all day.
* **Global Coverage**: Most phone plans don‚Äôt work in multiple countries without expensive roaming fees, but **Ryoko portable WiFi** does.
* **Connection Stability**: Ryoko connects to the strongest local cell tower, ensuring a more stable connection than my phone‚Äôs hotspot.

# Unexpected Benefits

There were a few surprises I didn‚Äôt anticipate:

* **Ad Blocker**: The built-in ad blocker sped up my browsing and kept annoying pop-ups away.
* **Family-Friendly**: I could connect up to 8 devices at once, which meant my entire family could stay online during road trips.
* **Compact Design**: The device is so small that it fits in my pocket, making it ideal for day trips or business meetings.

# Who Is Muama Ryoko For?

In my opinion, **Ryoko WiFi** is perfect for:

* **Travelers**: If you‚Äôre always on the go, this device is a lifesaver.
* **Remote Workers**: Reliable internet for Zoom calls, even in remote areas.
* **Students**: Stay connected on campus or during study sessions at coffee shops.
* **Families**: Share a single connection across multiple devices without interruptions.

# Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely‚Äîbut with some caveats. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a reliable and portable internet solution, **Muama Ryoko portable WiFi** is worth considering. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, but the combination of performance, security, and global coverage makes it a solid investment.

That said, if you rarely travel or already have an excellent phone plan with unlimited hotspot data, you might not see as much value.

# Final Thoughts

Using **Muama Ryoko WiFi** has genuinely changed how I stay connected. Whether I‚Äôm on a road trip, working remotely, or just relaxing at a caf√©, I know I‚Äôll have a stable, secure internet connection.

If you‚Äôre considering getting one, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth a shot‚Äîespecially with the current deals available. You can check out the details [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets). Let me know if you‚Äôve tried it or have any questions‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to share more insights!

So, that‚Äôs my take on **Ryoko WiFi**. Hope this helps someone decide whether it‚Äôs the right gadget for them. What do you think? Would you use a portable WiFi device like this?",1,1732009879.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

I should have stayed there with you forever.

You were just as I loved you the most; fluffy haired, soft, warm, sleepy, cuddly.

If I‚Äôd stayed in bed, if we‚Äôd never gone out that day, would things be different?

I feel so stupid. I feel so stupid. I feel so stupid.

I had a horrible realisation late last night as I dragged myself out of bed to shower. Everyone has commented on how much happier I‚Äôve been since I met you, how I smile more, laugh more, how I‚Äôm more confident. But now you‚Äôre gone, and I have to somehow claw myself back to being the girl I was before you. I‚Äôm going to have to work so God damn hard to get there, and even then, I‚Äôll be less happy than I was with you at the end of it. How is that fair?

I finally got rid of the plate you left in my bedroom after I made you breakfast that final morning. Or, rather, my sister did at my request because I couldn‚Äôt bear to do it myself. She took away the glass from the coffee table that you drank water from as you ended us, your hand trembling so hard I thought it would spill on my sofa. She deleted the games we played together on my PlayStation and one I downloaded to play because of how much you love it (you even had a tattoo of it. I miss your tattoos; I miss lying in bed and tracing over the ink with my fingers).

I thought they were the last traces of you, but I was wrong. I keep finding you. You‚Äôre everywhere.

Your toothbrush is still in my bathroom. The D20 dice you gave me on our first date because of how we bonded over a mutual love of D&D still sits under my computer screen. The pink miniature Eiffel Tower cocktail decoration I stole from that French themed bar as a memory of that date is still on my desk. The little purple dragon you bought me as a souvenir of our first getaway is still there. The hairbrush you ran to the supermarket to buy for me on that same trip because I forgot mine is still in my drawer. The note your mom wrote to me complimenting the cake I made is still stuck to my stand mixer.

You‚Äôre everywhere. You‚Äôre under my skin, you‚Äôre seared into my memories, your face burns behind my eyes.

I‚Äôve realised now that the last traces of you won‚Äôt be the physical evidence of your existence that were left behind, but the scars you‚Äôve left on my soul.

I love you so much I can‚Äôt eat. I love you so much that I threw up the meagre contents of my stomach this morning as soon as I woke up. I love you so much my stomach hurts. I love you so much my throat keeps closing over and I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. I love you so much I burst into tears when I least expect it.

I miss the days when it felt good to love you.

for context, im 19F and my younger sister is 15F
we live in a hdb where there is a coffee shop near our house (the next available place that sells food is 30mins away) so its where we mainly get food from as its the cheapest and most convenient option possible.

however when we go to buy food from there, we almost always get harassed by the men (think 40+) manning the stores. they have blown kisses at me, tried to flirt with me and more. this has been happening consistently for over a year. i have not done anything to provoke such reactions (i have resorted to keeping my eyes glued onto my phone so as to not make eye contact, refuse to speak when asked questions and only state my order + pay). the same applies to my sister as well despite her doing the same.

its gotten to the point where i feel stressed out about going to buy food, and my sister avoids eating entirely so as to not go downstairs. ive tried cooking at home as a solution but it is difficult to prep meals when we both have school and our parents both work (yes, have told our parents about this repeatedly but they havent provided any solutions either).

any ideas on how to go about this and what can be done? i doubt the police will be of any help... (my sister reported being molested on the bus a few months ago and there are still no leads on it...) ive considered asking my neighbours to go downstairs with us when buying food but that might be too troublesome for them.

im exhausted and i feel so helpless. its not something i can simply ignore and move on with my day about because it keeps bringing up recurring past trauma.",3,1732009552.0,askSingapore,15,0.71,False

\- 80%+ of successful startups have co-founders

\- Solo founders take 3x longer to reach market fit

\- 90% of solo founders experience burnout in first year



Why going solo is a trap:

1. You're trying to be a full-stack developer, marketer, sales person, and support all at once

2. While you're coding, your competition is already selling

3. No one to share the emotional burden with

4. Investors prefer founding teams over solo founders



But here's the good news:

You don't have to do it alone anymore.



I faced this exact problem when building ReplyGuy. Everything changed when I found a marketing co-founder. In just 2 months we:

\- Launched the product

\- Got first paying customers

\- Started growing organically



This experience inspired me to build [IndieMerger](https://indiemerger.com) \- an AI-powered platform where tech founders can find verified marketing & business co-founders (and vice versa).

1. An amusement park date where Person A is an adrenaline junkie and Person B can‚Äôt ride rollercoasters. Leaving maybe only 60% of the park map and possible boredom.

2. A coffee/bookstore date where Person A likes literary books and Person B likes comic books, vastly different genres with a potential for embarrassing disconnect or a lack of intellectual conversation.

Reading as a hobby is essentially the only common ground between Person A & B, meaning there could *potentially* be more things to talk about in a bookstore vs. an amusement park. But in the case the gap in genre may be too large to keep a conversation flow going, an amusement park may provide more fun opportunities to occupy the two and prevent unnatural silence. The only downside is the possibility of long lines which may lead to the same outcome: conversation running dry, or possible boredom for Person A even though they deny it.

I‚Äôm looking for an area that‚Äôs got good vibes, maybe a park or two, and some nice places to grab a coffee or a pint. Oh, and decent schools wouldn‚Äôt hurt‚Äîfuture-proofing and all that.

And here‚Äôs the thing: if there are any places I should absolutely avoid, please tell me now! The last thing I need is to drop ¬£2 million in the wrong spot. 

Cheers for reading and for any tips you throw my way‚Äîyou might just help me. Drinks are on me when I move in. üçª",0,1732009060.0,brum,17,0.13,False

D‚Äôs best friend Z (teen, m) was orphaned when he was a child. His parents and I had been good friends so I willingly took Z in, raising him from that point as if he were D‚Äôs bio brother. 

I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of my boys. D wants to attend culinary school and he‚Äôs very talented in the kitchen. He‚Äôs also quite athletic, he takes after me that way. The cooking skills he likely got from his Nonna. I can cook, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm starting kitchen fires, I can cook but I can‚Äôt make things of the same quality that D is capable of. D‚Äôs grades aren‚Äôt the best or worst. He‚Äôs a B average student but completes his homework every night and studies for his exams diligently. He just has his mind on other things: cooking, soccer, and the ladies. I‚Äôm in no position to judge since I was far worse at his age. 

Z is a very bright young man, he‚Äôs an A average student, on the honor roll, and could make Valedictorian if he keeps at it. His parents were academics as well so again, I‚Äôm not surprised. We‚Äôve had some ups and downs but overall I like to think we have a pretty decent relationship as adoptive father and son. We bond over video games and he has an interest in gardening which certainly helps with D‚Äôs cooking interests. Z wants to attend medical school, and become a surgeon. 

He felt comfortable enough to not only tell me that he was attracted to men and women, but that he‚Äôd begun dating a young man from school. Unfortunately the school outed his Boyfriend (K) to his parents and they kicked him out. So then, as far as I was concerned,I had three sons. 

K is more of your stereotypical ‚Äúguys guy‚Äù, he‚Äôs into fishing, handiness, robotics, and has his sights on mechanical engineering. 

K‚Äôs best friend since toddlerhood is a young woman named R. When I first met her, the boys were bandaging up some cuts she had and as soon as I saw the two black eyes her stepfather had given her I wished the watcher would torture him in the worst possible ways imaginable. 

I never had a daughter before but I filed for guardianship of R, and won. Admittedly I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing trying to raise a young woman. I keep worrying about her getting mixed in with the wrong fellas. She‚Äôs also incredibly gifted in art and wants to pursue fashion. 

That being said, onto my original reason for posting: I ran into an ex recently and we caught up over coffee. She called me a llama for taking on K and R, claiming that I had no right to interfere with how other people raise their children. I explained that they weren‚Äôt raising them, they were abusing and abandoning them. I don‚Äôt step in unless danger to a minor is evident but in her eyes, even that is over stepping. She even said before I used to collect girlfriends, and I‚Äôve moved on to collecting children. 

She‚Äôs not wrong about the women. I was quite a serial romantic before I became a father, but my son changed me. There‚Äôs still a part of me that wonders: AITA for ‚Äúcollecting children‚Äù? ",6,1732008435.0,AITASims,2,1.0,False

Around 3 years ago, my husband and I asked ourselves why there is no ""Philippines"" Nespresso capsule when we know that our coffee can compete globally in terms of taste and quality. We then started this startup business of producing Nespresso-compatible capsules with Philippine coffee. =D Pero heto nga, after 3 years, we are still not profitable. I know we just need to invest on marketing, product development, etc., but we are running out of funds. We do not have physical stores, only Lazada / Shopee, with our Shopee store having non-existent sales ever since we started. In our Lazada store naman, we have 430 unique buyers so far, 33% of it are repeat-customers (>1 order). So we are holding on to the thesis na we just lack marketing power. In any case, we tried to entice customers in two ways:

1. Marketing - We tried Sponsored Discovery, FB ads, but no effect. We end up just giving free money to Lazada / FB. So far, we think taking the organic growth route is better. It just saddens us na 3 years na kami and still the number of repeat-customers we have is not enough to sustain us. So we are thinking maybe the problem is the product itself, so we continue to invest in product development.
2. Product development - We improved our products overtime like changing to a better (but costlier) capsule, etc. We are also FDA-approved.

We want to know if we should continue this business or not. Malaki rin ang fixed expenses / cost of doing business. We have the following ask to this community:

1. If you have a Nespresso machine, hope you can buy / review our product so we can improve. You can purchase our product in our Lazada store with 50% discount so you can try with low risk. Just click the link below to collect the voucher.

1gut4ri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gut4ri,This small unpretentious coffee kiosk serving Singaporean style coffee in RobMag deserves to have more branches.,"Imho, there‚Äôs something really gastronomically appealing about Singaporean and Malaysian-style coffee drinks. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but they have a distinct flavor profile: strong (which I personally enjoy) with a toasty undertone and caramelly notes.

This store in Robmag, owned by a Singaporean, although very modest in aesthetics (very dull actually they badly need a revamp) packs a punch that i really thought it's become my reference point when it comes to good Asian coffee. By ""handmade,"" I assume they use naturally brewed coffee from artisanally roasted beans (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.)

As I prefer hot drinks, their Kopi-C is my personal favorite - evaporated milk and coffee really goes well together. Their Gula Melaka, priced at 125 for a large cup, is equally impressive - sweet, toasty, coconutty with minimal acidity.

What is your point of reference when it comes to good Asian coffee or coffee in general?

After my third night of waking up spread-eagled like a starfish with fourteen regular pillows strategically placed around me, I knew something had to change.

So, after a little research, I came across this pregnancy pilow from Momcozy. 

Here's my thoughts.

# First Impressions

The thing practically leaps out of its packaging like it had been waiting its whole life for this moment. Which was a surpirse, because it comes in what looks like a compressed body bag (not concerning at all).

Getting it into my bedroom felt like a weird, solo version of moving a couch up a narrow staircase. PIVOT! I yelled to myself, channeling my inner Ross, as I moved around corners. My neighbors probably thought I was finally losing it.

But once I managed to wrangle it onto the bed, I stood back to admire my new sleeping pillow. The grey velvet cover felt fancy enough to make me temporarily forget I was essentially buying a body-sized security blanket.

# My Favorite Features

**U-shape design.** It curves around you like a protective mother hen, if mother hens were incredibly soft and didn't occasionally peck at you. The design is basically a full-body hug from someone who never gets tired, never complains about their arm falling asleep, and never asks you to make coffee in the morning.

**Velvet cover.** The removable cover feels like petting a very expensive cat. It's soft enough to make you want to rub your face on it (which I did, multiple times, no shame), but durable enough to withstand the various trials of pregnancy: midnight snack spills, drool (it happens), and the occasional emotional breakdown.

**Support.** It cradles your head, supports your back, hugs your belly, aligns your hips, and somehow manages to keep your ankles from feeling like they've been replaced with water balloons. 

**Temperature management.** This pillow can make things toasty. But I just consider it preparation for those nights when my partner steals all the blankets. 

# Pros

**Excellent support**

* Feels like floating on a custom-shaped cloud
* Eliminates the need for pillow Tetris with multiple regular pillows
* Supports literally everything, including my decision to eat pickles at 3am

**Versatile**

* Works for pregnancy, nursing, lounging, and general life enhancement
* Can double as a reading backrest or impromptu fort
* Useful even post-pregnancy (my non-pregnant husband keeps trying to steal it)

**Great construction**

* Maintains shape better than my post-pregnancy fitness goals
* Cover is removable and washable (crucial for those ice cream in bed moments)
* Durable enough to survive multiple pregnancy journeys

**Pain relief**

* Reduces back pain better than my husband's well-intentioned but awkward massages
* Helps with hip alignment and sciatica
* Makes side-sleeping actually comfortable

# Cons

* Takes up more bed real estate than a small country
* Can get warm during the night (though great for winter)
* Might make your partner feel replaced by a pillow
* Storage is... interesting (good luck finding a closet space big enough)

Last year I spent NYE in Iceland and it was so magical I'm going back again this year (amazing NYE traditions, snow globe winter vibes). Looking for recommendations on where to explore in the days between Iceland and London!

Confirmed elements:
- Dec 25: LAX ‚Üí London (overnight)
- Dec 26-27: London (while Christmas lights and festive decorations are still up!)
- NYE: Definitely want to be in Reykjav√≠k
- Planning 2 day Iceland tour + 1 day exploring (flexible if before or after NYE)
- Jan 6-10: London (meeting friends)
- Jan 10: London ‚Üí LAX

Looking to fill those days between Iceland and London! Meeting friends in Austria might be an option, but wanted to get some more ideas in case that falls through. Ideally somewhere that would:
- Work well as a winter destination
- Good for 3-4 days
- Solo traveler friendly and safe
- Easy to navigate by foot and public transport
- Somewhere I might meet people despite winter season!

About me (26F):
- Love exploring cities on foot, finding local coffee shops
- Enjoy mixing tourist spots with local experiences
- Love festive lights, spirit, and winter markets
- Love shopping (both local boutiques and familiar stores)
- Have a soft spot for places with cute animals (though not a must, but I loved the Icelandic horses!!)
- Budget flexible but not luxury
- Very comfortable with public transport from living in London and traveling through Europe

Places I've absolutely loved:
- London (studied abroad for a year, feels like my second home)
- Iceland in winter (magical NYE experience last year in addition to a surreal south coast/golden circle 3 day tour 
- The Dolomites (breathtaking views, hiking)
- Barcelona (architecture, food, shopping)
- Cinque Terre (coastal views, hiking between towns)

Also been to Portugal, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Dublin, Madrid, Bilbao, Mallorca, Rome, Florence, Milan, Sicily, Turin

Really drawn to places that:
- Have beautiful architecture or natural scenery
- Feel a bit magical or other worldly
- Make you & your worries feel small
- Have good food and cafe culture
- Are walkable with lots to explore

Would love suggestions for somewhere new to visit roughly Jan 2nd-6th, especially places that might have good hostel culture or winter activities that may bring people together!

That‚Äôs when it hit me, I really did feel different. My energy wasn‚Äôt just better; it was consistent. I wasn‚Äôt crashing mid-afternoon, and I wasn't getting my coffee cravings.

The best part? It wasn‚Äôt just me noticing. My wife‚Äôs appreciation was proof enough that this stuff was working. Posting this for anyone else who's in the same position that I was, I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but it works for me.

I like coffee very much. Every day i start from delicious capuccino for me and my wife. I left my work in IT (ERP systems) to open coffeeshop. Right now i taking brake from work, got some time to rest till the end of 2024. Also playing games (similators like factorio or cities skylines, anno, soulslikes and rpgs) , like to travelling and my family. Also i want to write a book some day.

That‚Äôs all for now, see you tomorrow.

","Hey everyone! 

I'm on a mission to find the best Nespresso machine for my coffee fix, and after a lot of research, I wanted to share what I found. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast or just need something quick and easy, there‚Äôs a Nespresso machine for everyone. Here are some of the top options to consider:

1. **Nespresso VertuoPlus**: People who love a variety of coffee sizes The VertuoPlus is super versatile, allowing you to brew everything from espresso to large mugs. It has a one-touch system, which makes it easy to use, and the coffee comes out tasting great every time!
2. **Nespresso CitiZ** : Espresso lovers in small spaces The CitiZ is sleek, compact, and perfect for espresso or lungo lovers. It‚Äôs great for apartments or small kitchens and heats up quickly, so you‚Äôre never waiting too long for your cup.
3. **Nespresso Creatista Plus**: Those who want to make barista-style drinks If you‚Äôre into frothy cappuccinos or lattes, the Creatista Plus comes with a built-in milk frother that lets you get creative. It‚Äôs on the pricier side but worth it if you love experimenting with different coffee drinks.
4. **Nespresso Essenza Mini**: Budget-conscious coffee drinkers This is Nespresso‚Äôs most affordable model, and it still delivers delicious espresso in a compact form. If you want something simple and effective, the Essenza Mini is a great option.

What are your favorite Nespresso machines? Any recommendations for specific models or capsules? Let‚Äôs chat about the best way to get that perfect cup of coffee!",1,1732006802.0,NespressoVertuo,0,1.0,False

(NB we have had a couple of conversations about navigating friendship/brother context.) He is married (30f), I will call them Dave and Eva.

I do political activism, some of which could be thought of as a little risky. When I moved up, Dave said he was invigorated I was going to be around more, since he wanted to engage in political activism too. He would often bring up conversations about it, often in a theoretical way, but was also interested in events. I have more of a history with this and a higher risk tolerance, so I guess some of the stuff I would talk about might sound ""risky"".

I had a keen sense Eva was unhappy he was becoming interested in political activism. I figured this was between them since Dave wanted to join me, and when we hung out together he would often bring it up. Eva communicates passive aggressively much of the time, and I did not think me speaking with her would be fruitful and I did not consider it my business.

I was never encouraging him to engage in any activity, but would invite him along to stuff I was going to. Sometimes I would bring up conversations since it seemed mutually interesting.

Dave came along to a couple of events. One of these was a protest outside a courthouse (in support of somebody who had been arrested). Nothing dangerous, a nice liberal protest, flags and placards type stuff. After this Dave and I grabbed a coffee. In the context of him talking about risk and fear, Dave told me Eva had warned him that morning to be ""careful of me [OP] leading him [Dave] down the garden path.""

I asked him if he felt led down the garden path and he said ""a bit, yes."" Basically being responsibilized, I was annoyed since he had engaged as much as me. I have not really spoken to them much since to create distance. Maybe I should have treated Dave & Eva as one entity, and perhaps thought about age gap/big brother context, but AITA here?",2,1732006717.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Due to stress I've been gaining a lot of weight this past few months because of stress-eating (Chips and chocolate or cookies every day) and overall bad diet. Before I weighted 54kg and I want to go back to my previous weight. I came up with the idea of starting the day with what I consider is a pretty nutritious breakfast: One banana or apple with yogurt and flax seed to get the vitamins, calcium and fiber. Two slices of whole wheat bread for carbs and a bit of fiber, one with scrambled eggs and some veggies for protein and the other with jam so I get something sweet but not too sweet cause I have a pretty sweet tooth. And then a cup of warm milk for calcium (warm milk fills me more than cold milk). I don't usually do lunch because I don't really have time, but if I do I go for toast with turkey low-fat ham, a slice of cheese and tomatoes or lettuce. Then for dinner I try to keep it light as well, cause I don't want to consume calories I won't burn. But if I do cook something I go for pasta with zuchinni and tomato sauce, I'm trying to add chicken to that as well for more protein. Through the day I usually have green apples, nuts or chopped tomatoes or sliced cucumber as a snack. I also usually have one or two cups of coffee a day and two or three cups of tea, I'm trying to drink more water as well.

I've also been trying to do more excercise, I want to start with those 30-40min workouts. I also live in a walkable city where I can bike anywhere too, so I usually do that every day unless I don't have class and stay at home

Is this an alright idea for a diet? Or should I make more changes? Hope yall can help me. ",0,1732006323.0,loseit,2,0.2,False

She has a boyfriend (25M) of about two(?) years. Before he and I started dating I thought they were together. I wasn‚Äôt the only one that thought this and it took a bit of explaining to say that they were just friends. For the first month that he and I were dating he and her would go on 1 on 1 hangouts at coffee shops all the time. I know this because during what was supposed to be one of these hangouts he was with me instead. He canceled on her a bit last minute (I say this because I don‚Äôt know exactly when they agreed to meet up) and she was blowing up his phone. Text after text. With one big paragraph tell him that he was inconsiderate, to tell her sooner, and that she didn‚Äôt agree to meet up to do a project because they were supposed to be hanging out. After this I told him he needs to set up boundaries or else I would be forced to walk out of the relationship. He eventually told her he wanted to set some boundaries, that they were still friends but would only hang out in group settings, and that this wasn‚Äôt the first time people thought they were together. 

Why exactly is this an issue? He basically handled this! (You might say) well this is when the problems arose. She wasn‚Äôt a fan of me to begin with but this really sent her over the edge. The next time we saw her after the boundaries were set was at a party. In the haze of people I spot her and another one of their friends, I go up to them and greet them. Instead of greeting us she turns to us and dead pan says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre over there‚Äù motioning to a general direction everyone is sitting at and turns her back to us. The rest of the night was her ignoring us and actively pulling people away when they tried talking to us. The next time, about two days later, I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt. This time at a more intimate house party I greeted her, and again (in front of people) acted like she didn‚Äôt hear nor see me. Later in the night when I was passing out cake I offered her one and she actually looked over my head and acted like she didn‚Äôt hear me. (Grown ass woman btw). Yet again the rest of the night she ignored me and pulled everyone away that dared to talk to us. Both times I expressed to my boyfriend that I did not appreciate the way she was being especially considering I haven‚Äôt been rude to her. I‚Äôve driven her home, consoled her, gifted her stuff in the short time I‚Äôve known her. I told my boyfriend if she did it to me one more time I would be forced to confront her in front of everyone. His only response is ‚ÄúI agree with you. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs acting this way. I‚Äôm on your side‚Äù The thing is if it reaches that point I don‚Äôt think I would be able to continue the relationship. It feels like he‚Äôs prioritizing her and her feelings over me. Like I don‚Äôt matter enough for him to step into the situation when I‚Äôm basically getting schoolyard bullied. Am I over reacting?

TL;DR: my boyfriend has a girl best friend thats bullying me. He doesn‚Äôt stand up for me & I think I won‚Äôt be able to continue the relationship if he won‚Äôt say anything. ",7,1732006109.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.89,False

1gusr60,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gusr60,Current Collection After Trial and Error,"I wanted to share my current collection after being in the game for almost 2 years! After countless blind buys, samples, and trades, I‚Äôve reached a point where I can confidently say everything I own is a 10/10 for me. In the slides after, you can see all the colognes I used to own but have since let go. To give back to the community, I‚Äôm going to review each one quickly and why I kept/let it go:¬†

Fragrances I own:¬†

CC Blonde Amber - Super nice amber vanilla with some dried fruit and spiciness too. Use this as my special occasion fragrance.

LV Imagination - Fresh and clean scent with a hint of sophistication as well. Use this as my school/work fragrance, but is super versatile and can be used whenever.¬†¬†

Sospiro Vibrato - Another fresh scent with a blast of ginger and some florals in the back. Really easy to dress up or down. Use this as my summer/club going out scent.¬†

Mind Games Queening - The newest pick up, a beautiful coconut vanilla rum scent that is so cozy and smells amazing. Use this as my cold weather day scent.¬†

MFK Oud Satin Mood - Definitely one of my more interesting scents, a rosey oud vanilla fragrance that smells so unique. Use this as my cold weather going out scent.¬†

LV Afternoon Swim - A super realistic citrus fragrance that smells almost like fruit candy. Use this as my warm weather day scent.¬†

On the way - Bond no. 9 Lafayette Street. Smelled this in store and fell in love. In seach of a bottle.¬†

Fragrances I no longer own and why:¬†

YSL Y EDP - A great beginner fragrance that smells great, just became a bit cloying almost to me and reminded me of a teenager. If thats you, by all means get it.¬†

YSL La Nuit De L‚ÄôHomme EDP - Was my second fragrance I ever got. It‚Äôs nice, but you can definitely find better for the price. La Nuit De L‚ÄôHomme is much better.¬†

Bleu de Chanel EDT - My first fragrance. Will always be a favorite of mine, but eventually you have to move on. Also, I like the EDP a bit more! The macy‚Äôs worker really pressured me into this one looking back.¬†

PDM Carlisle - Got this in a trade. Definitely a dark scent but was definitely too powerful and mature for me. Kind of smelled like oil and tires in a way, not really sure.

Killian Angels‚Äô Share - This is a nice fragrance, but honestly felt a little feminine to me because of the praline note (also my sister owns kismet angel so it reminded me of her).

BDK Gris Charnel Extrait - This is another dark fragrance that felt a bit too mature for me. I just couldnt think of a time I would use it, and it smelled a bit lactonic to me in the opening.¬†

MFK Grand Soir - This gets a lot of hype so I might get some hate for this, but I feel as though it may be too mature for younger audiences. Definitely a refined and sophisticated vanilla scent. Also, not a big fan of the balsamic-ish opening. The dry down is heavenly though.¬†

PDM Oajan- A much bigger fan of this than angels‚Äô share. An addictive cinnamon apple pie scent that I couldnt stop putting on. It felt a bit powdery to me and for the price point I feel like there are other sweet fragrances that could be a better option, but one of my favorites!¬†

Initio Side Effect - Another hyped up fragrance. It was nice but gave me a headache for some reason again, maybe it was the boozy cinamon tobacco combination.¬†

The blazing mr. sam - Smelled great in store, ordered it online. Comes in - eh. It‚Äôs nice, but another mature scent thats harder to pull off. Also doesn‚Äôt last that long. Favorite bottle design!¬†

Dior Homme Intense - I still love this fragrance. Smelled it completely randomly in a duty free store in switzerland. Cannot recommend enough for a nice date night/ special occasion fragrance! A pretty saturated category which is why I don‚Äôt own it, but great.

Aventus Cologne- Smells great. Performance and longevity? Horrible. Had to let it go because of it, but maybe an older batch might be better.

PDM Percival - A nice everyday scent, but for the price you pay I just have to say it‚Äôs not worth it. To a random person it just smells like deodorant or body spray.¬†

Xerjoff Torino 21 - Another favorite of mine! Minty mojito vibes and a great summer fragrance. Let it go because I enjoyed afternoon swim a bit more.¬†

Oud satin mood extrait - Yes I had the extrait before the EDP due to the hype. Honestly, any time I wore this the powdery effect was way too strong and people told me I smelled like an old lady. I like the EDP more!¬†

Xerjoff Uden - I still like this, a nice coffee vanilla fragrance and something people should look for! Let it go because vibrato is more suited to my taste.¬†

Creed Aventus - The all-time great but same problem with aventus cologne; performance and longevity are horrible. Wish that this was fixed in the future!

Prada L‚Äôhomme - Another favorite of mine, super clean soapy iris. If imagination didnt exist, I would still own this.¬†

Intio musk therapy‚ÄîIt was just fine. The musk was definitely prominent, but it made me smell‚Ä¶ wet? I‚Äôm unsure how to describe it.

PDM Layton‚ÄîAnother nice scent, but a bit overrated, in my opinion. Althair and Oajan are better, but it's still a classic scent that everyone should get their nose on.¬†

Initio Paragon - This reminded me of cough syrup and gave me an intense headache‚Äîhard pass.¬†

That‚Äôs all! I‚Äôve smelled a lot more than these so hmu if you have any questions. If you made it to the end I appreciate you.",1,1732005791.0,Colognes,1,1.0,False

Initially, the fast was intended to last 40 days, but Angus, feeling surprisingly comfortable and motivated, extended it for over a year. During this time, he survived solely on water, liquids, and supplements, while his body burned fat for energy. Regular medical checks, including blood tests, ensured his safety. Starting at 207 kg, Angus lost an astounding 125 kg, reaching his ideal weight of 82 kg. He broke the fast on July 11, 1966, with a simple meal of a hard-boiled egg, bread, and coffee, though it immediately made him feel full. Continued medical monitoring showed that his weight remained under 90 kg for the next five years, and he maintained this healthy weight for the rest of his life.

These 2 girls my bf used to be  best-friends with that he hasn‚Äôt spoke to in 6 months went to the funeral (they were friends with his brother but were on bad terms with him when he passed) and went to his house after what happened to speak with his parents and family. They seemed to be pretty close with his family and they found their way back into his life. One night me and my bf were hanging out when I noticed she texted him saying things like ( I‚Äôll call them Sabrina and Ana) ‚ÄúSabrina‚Äôs naked in the bed right now‚Äù  and  ‚Äú I wanna fuck Jonathan‚Äù ( my boyfriends other older brother who‚Äôs alive). I scrolled up on the chats and he told them ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call tonight‚Äù the night we were going to see each other. He answered their call and I said something and they texted him assuming he was with either with me or this other girl Rita that my bf has been talking to about his brother since he passed since she knew the both of them and was close with his brother. They called again and I pretended I wasn‚Äôt there and he went on to yell at them and told them to stop calling and that they were ruining his relationship and Ana made a nasty comment about our relationship. She got emotional and said he was really hurting her feelings and being disrespectful and she truly did sound upset about that fact that he yelled at her. He said he didn‚Äôt want me to know he was talking to them bc he knew I didn‚Äôt like them and he didn‚Äôt wanna make me upset. After bothering him for the next few days and constantly bringing up the fact he was talking to them and hiding it from me even though he kept claiming they only talked about his brother who past and life , I made him call them in person while my friend was in the backseat and the same girl who disrespected our relationship told him he‚Äôs so flirty after I made him ask why they keep calling on no caller ID bc they had been blocked for days after I found out. They told me they can send proof and he hung up and my friend and him both told me there just trying to make things up and they had no proof since they said they‚Äôll send it later when I asked him to show me. A few days later he told me that they were saying weird things on the phone this one night and saying they wanna get fucked and they wanna know what it‚Äôs like to have sex and all sorts of weird stuff. He said he told them to go live your life and do it. He said they only said this one time. At some point I texted this girl Sabrina and questioned her and she said they never said anything like that and they‚Äôre more than just friends because she‚Äôs close with his family and his parents love her and Ana so they‚Äôre like family. She assured me there was nothing going on between my bf and them and it was just a strong friendship and she never liked him and they never had anything going on. Last night when my bf picked me up those 2 girls called him on no called ID and I asked them why they keep calling and they never gave a clear answer.  My bf claimed this was the first time they called that day. Only Ana was speaking. I asked her why she still calls after he disrespected her and she told me he‚Äôs said worse about me to them in the past. She said that he called me a whore before to them and just tries to get between my legs and my bf swore that wasn‚Äôt true and she‚Äôs trying to get us to break up. I then proceeded to get mad and I threw his phone out the window but afterwards we some how made up for the night . My bf and I had a fight the next morning bc he was getting irritated that I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with him that morning and the night before and he was just being an asshole. I got mad and I spilled a little water at him he spit in my face all bc I didn‚Äôt wanna have sex. We were in the car and he was going to drive me home and kept saying things that was really making me angry and I picked up an ice coffee out of anger and it exploded everywhere.  I feel bad bc he had a picture of his brother who passed on his dashed a little coffee got on it but I was just so angry. He said he wanted to break up after begging me not to leave him the night before the fight. The only way these girls at this point have been contacting him was through no caller ID bc he had them blocked on everything. He blocked his no caller ID calls the night before and after the fight and I spilled the coffee he said we were done and breaking up then later told me on the phone we‚Äôre still together and he loves me. He turned the calls back on after the fight and I know because I called him on no caller ID a few hours after he dropped me home and it went through . I suspected he spoke with them and I lied and said Sabrina told me they talked when she didn‚Äôt and he ended up admitting it but he spoke with Ana. He told me he told her what I did and she asked him ‚Äúis this really what you want‚Äù and he said no but she‚Äôs my girl. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs telling the truth. 

I‚Äôm just at a loss right now. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Idk whether or not I should stay with him or not.

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the endless stream of memes your friends send you? If so, there‚Äôs good news: replying with ‚ÄúHaha So True!‚Äù (HST) might be all you need to maintain those friendships with minimal effort.  



According to a very real study published in the Cranberry-Lemon Journal of Astrological Big Data Ecology

(yes, that‚Äôs a thing), researchers Koothrappali & Nahasapeemapetilon

source: [https://jabde.com/2024/11/17/haha-so-true-reply-in-text-theory/](https://jabde.com/2024/11/17/haha-so-true-reply-in-text-theory/)

Explored the effectiveness of HST as a low-energy strategy for digital bonding. Here‚Äôs the tea:  

The Experiment  

150 participants were divided into three groups to respond to their friends‚Äô memes:  

1. HST Group: Replied with ‚ÄúHaha So True!‚Äù every time.  

2. High-Effort Group: Crafted enthusiastic responses like ‚ÄúOMG LMAO‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just snorted coffee.‚Äù  

3. Silent Group: Ghosted their friends entirely.  



Researchers measured friendship satisfaction, guilt, and perceived enthusiasm using some very serious-sounding tools (like the Satisfaction Ratings of Engagement scale).  



The Findings  

\- Friendship Satisfaction: Both the HST and high-effort groups boosted satisfaction levels, while silence was a friendship killer. Interestingly, HST was just as effective as the high-effort responses.   

\- Guilt-Free Zone: The HST group felt less guilt than the silent group, proving that even low-effort replies are better than none.   

\- Effort vs. Enthusiasm: High-effort responses were seen as more enthusiastic, but HST still delivered a solid ‚ÄúI see you‚Äù vibe without draining emotional energy.  



The Verdict

The study concluded that HST is a minimalist‚Äôs dream. It keeps friendships alive without requiring you to pour your soul into every text. As the authors put it, ‚ÄúHaha So True!‚Äù is the perfect balance of acknowledgment and emotional detachment.  



Should You Use It? 

Absolutely unless your friend expects you to bring Shakespearean-level wit to the chat. While it‚Äôs not a replacement for genuine connection, it‚Äôs a lifeline for those ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even‚Äù days.  



So next time you‚Äôre bombarded with memes, remember: a quick ‚ÄúHaha So True!‚Äù might just save the friendship without breaking a sweat.",1,1732004593.0,Somalia,0,1.0,False

1gusgzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gusgzp/did_he_friendzoned_me/,Did he friend-zoned me?,"
He broke off with the only girlfriend he‚Äôs ever had like 7 months ago, they were together for 3 years and was the reason why he wouldn‚Äôt come to the hangouts, plus he lives the most far away from us.
Almost two months ago we started talking more frequently until we arranged to go out just the two of us (we are part of the same friend group since forever but no one knew him irl besides a chilhood friend, we all hang on discord multiple times a week), so we go out and turns out we have amazing chemistry.
Started going out almost every weekend until we get together with the whole group (guy friends he knew for years but never irl, I‚Äôm the only female), that night he was glued to me, never left my side and if we got all on a circle he‚Äôd move to be beside me, even if he was left out of it, he drank from my cup the whole night, etc.

From there we kept going out almost weekend, everytime the outings are going to turistic spots, museums, movies, he once took me to an arcade cause he said he wanted to beat me in all of them, etc. Always alone but he tends to comment that a guy friend in particular should‚Äôve come for x reason (although neither he or I invite him, never, we keep planning solo outings).

Every time we meet he brings me some kind of trinket (literally a trinket, today he brought me like a screw cap from an ac he and his dad installed this week, other times he brought me like brochure things of those that they hand you on the street but because they had my name on it, and so on), a few days ago we were talking about clay stuff that I make on my free time and he asked me if I could make something for him but later told me no cause it was a gift he wanted to get me and realized I would be making my own gift.
When I smile at him he immediately smiles back. 
He talks to me every single day, with even the most silly excuses just to talk for a few minutes. Tells me I should post more photos of me, compliments my tattoos, asks me for advice on hair or clothes.
We watch movies almost every single day too, the rest of our friends stop logging on when there‚Äôs only us on the channel because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to bother us‚Äù. 

Thing is yesterday we went out for like six hours to go to a few museums and stuff and when we‚Äôve ended the tour and was nighttime we went to grab a seat and he told me he should get going cause he had a long trip back to his house (he lives an hour away from me), though he said that he just sat there, either in silence or asking me random things, like he didn‚Äôt wanted to leave. I asked him if the next time we meet was going to be already on his birthday (it‚Äôs in two weeks and I‚Äôve been handmaking him a cloak from his favorite character from his favorite book series, from scratch, so I‚Äôm pretty excited for that) and he told me ‚Äòno, next week actually‚Äô and I was like really? and he smiled and went ‚Äòyeah, do you want to go out next week?‚Äô and I told him of course. Then asked me if I wanted to grab a last coffee, and when we were waiting for it he says: I feel a bit awkward reposting the story you tagged me in today cause we‚Äôve been going out every weekend and people will think you are my girlfriend. ??? (girlfriend instead of ‚Äòdating‚Äô is oddly specific)

I asked him why he care and he got a bit nervous saying stuff like it‚Äôs an availability thing? but it got me really confused because literally the last time we went out he told me that I should tag him so I‚Äôd save him the job of taking pictures of the outings since he sucked taking photos and I had a good eye (he reposted every single one and he ended up reposting yesterday‚Äôs too)

It‚Äôs weird because he‚Äôs very shy and antisocial, only has two friends whom he meets irl but on rarely occasions, he only goes out to his kickboxing classes or to a coffeeshop or park to read, he‚Äôs a very lonely guy. My friends told me it‚Äôs obvious he likes me and maybe since I‚Äôm the first girl he‚Äôs going out with after his breakup he got either scared for him or for her feelings since they still follow eachother (they broke up on good terms). They told me a guy would never meet with a girl friend every weekend with that long of a bus trip and even more knowing he‚Äôs into getting little things for me. I‚Äôd normally guess he‚Äôs into me but that thing he told me threw me for a loop, could you help me?

1gusgum,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gusgum,Major mishap! Jack Pine Puzzle Co. - Rainbow - 1000h,"This has to be in my top 3 puzzles for the year. I loved this puzzle because of how gratifying sorting by color felt and how well it positioned me to work through each section. 

And then the mishap happened. Well first, I should say that I typically finish puzzles in the evening, take a photo, and disassemble them. Since I loved this one so much I left it in my board until the morning to allow for a photo in daylight. I had the board on my coffee table and in the morning I accidentally spilled a glass of electrolyte water all over the puzzle and the board!! I panicked. I grabbed a ton of paper towel and tried to soak up and wipe the water. Big mistake. The print rubbed off from the cardboard pieces. Despite my best efforts the puzzle was not salvageable. 

I still loved doing it and I‚Äôd do it again if I end up buying it. This one I got at a swap so I don‚Äôt feel as bad as I would if I had purchased it brand new. Thanks for reading :) ",1,1732004412.0,Jigsawpuzzles,1,1.0,False
