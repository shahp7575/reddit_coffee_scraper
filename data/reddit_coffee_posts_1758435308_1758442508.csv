On rereading it, I just feel like it's far-fetched. Everything is meant to be a bit exaggerated compared to the reality‚Äî I'm aware their personnality isn't realistic. (Like creating a bomb out of nowhere, storming in in a room just to tell some trivial matters)
 
My first language isn't english, don't hesitate to point out my weird phrasing or grammar mistakes.

I'm also wondering about pacing: is it going too fast? Should my paragraphs be longer?

It's supposed to be US-based, except I've never lived there. So I'm not quite sure how college works over there. Neither do I for dorms, I just based it on my European experience and how I did when I was in school...

I'm not writing a book, just practicing!

(Sorry if I messed up the flair- I didn't know which one fit best)





Here is the story:



Luke knew it was going to be a long and embarrassing year as soon as Kevin closed the faculty lounge's door behind him and slammed a coffee on his table‚Äî a little gift a man did for his husband for the start of the school year. 


Kevin fell on his chair loudly, yawning, making sure the whole room and especially his partner would hear his return. His briefcase crashed to the floor with a loud bang, as metal and tools clattered around inside. 
Everyone had to stop everything they were doing to look at him and wait for him to finish his mess. 



""What are y'all staring at?"" He asked with a triumphant smile. 



""Oh, nothing,"" Miss Robin murmured, giggling silently and taking another sip of her tea. 



The whole room is getting ready organizing papers and preparing their courses while Kevin... Isn't. Far too boring activity for a man like him. So he searches through his briefcase, finds something to create a small bomb, and places it on Luke's desk. Luke doesn't react. Kevin does, struggling to contain his laughter. Luke pinches the bridge of his nose, breathes heavily and just throws away the few ruined papers the explosion touched. 



""Are you gonna be an ass the whole year?"" Luke asks, genuinely worried. 



""Hopefully I will,"" the brown-haired answers, still containing his laughter. 



All the teachers in the room glanced at him, not one of them is smiling, which doesn't make him less proud.
And as he was about to do something dumb again, Mr. Dracule, the theater teacher, cleared his throat and asked the room.



""For which classes has Simon signed up for? The little genius from last year. He's had for mine."" 



They all look at their small list of students, except for Kevin and Lawrence, definitely knowing Simon never would have signed up for any engineering or sport class. 



Until Luke speaks up. 



""He's signed up for med... And following what's written here, for engineering as well"". Kevin almost spits out his fruit juice and looks Luke dead in the eyes.



""What?! I don't want him!"" He barks.



""Well, the boy's a genius, you should encourage such behavior instead of... Whatever you're doing here,"" Luke calmly replies.



""Well he's not the type of student I like in my class! And he specifically said never wanting to take engineering classes!""



""When did he say that? In your dreams? Let the man take the classes he wants!"" Luke answers, starting to get defensive. He won't get anywhere defending him, but the way Kevin is treating his (favorite) student when the year hasn't even started yet is already infuriating.



""He's one of the better students, let him be, he'll do no harm in your class..."" Luke mutters finally.



""Don't tell me what to do, you..."" Kevin cringes while crushing his empty carton of juice in his hands and standing up to leave.



""You'll live,"" He teases him under his breath.





‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî





At the other end of the school, students were gathering in their respective rooms. Simon, being the usual exemplary student he is, was already in his, arranging books, folding clothes and checking his schedule. Everything in its place, just like he liked it, getting ready for the new year ahead.


The calm didn't last long: Pauline burst into the room panting, out of breath while throwing her backpack onto the floor, the wind from the violently opened door sending a pile of papers from Simon's deck flying to the floor. Of course she couldn't  explain things calmly like a normal person.



""Wh- the fuck was that, Pauline?"" Simon asked, concerned.



""It's horrible! Simon, it's terrible!"" She practically screamed, putting both her hands on Simon's shoulders. Real fear was written all over her face‚Äî and what could be so serious that she had to run up four flights of stairs just to warn her best friend?



""Just tell me already, you're freaking me out!"" Simon blurted, on the verge of tears. Gosh, this is probably so unnecessary, he thought.



""We can't choose our dorm room this year! The school has already set it up!"" Pauline screams.



""WHAT?!"" Simon screams even louder 



""You have to come and see it by yourself! It's in the schoolyard!"" She shouted before running off.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I struggle with all that stuff. Getting greasy skin 2 hours into my day. Showering, putting on clothes and smelling musty after 30 minutes. Breath being rancid after coffee even tho I brush 2-3x a day. I don‚Äôt have any medical conditions I‚Äôm just a normal human being. 

I bought a little pouch, no bigger than my phone. It fits into my pocket perfectly and if not it fits into my palm so I can carry it easily. Literally saved my life so many times I can‚Äôt even count it. What I have in it:

1x menstrual pad (optional)

1x bandaid

1x small travel size wet wipes 

1x travel sized toothbrush- baby toothbrush works even better

1x travel sized toothpaste or toothpaste pills (basically freeze dried toothpaste that work just as good as the squeeze one)

1x Small deodorant (the are ones that you can apply with your fingers and come in small containers they are really good)

1x travel sized perfume

1x a small vanity mirror+hairbrush combo - that thingy old people use when one side is a mirror and other is a brush

1x grease removing wipes (it‚Äôs for skin but work for hair too)


Literally tho. It will solve any problems you might have. Bad breath? Go to the toilet and use the toothpaste and brush. Sweaty? Wet wipes (neck+armpit+ arms) and deodorant after +perfume. Greasy skin? Grease wipes. Messy hair? Use the grease wipes and little brush. 


You can use them even in toilet stalls if you don‚Äôt want people to see you grooming. Very small, cheap and easy to carry. Seriously everyone should have it in their bag or pockets ",2,1758440652.0,hygiene,2,1.0,False

I often only drink coffee with a little milk plus some fruit until dinner around 1700. After dinner I try to eat very little, maybe more fruit or vegetables. The point with this is that I think my main problem all this year is over-eating. I am just very good at shown down big portions in a very short time.

My point is, could this be a good think when doing long days on a bike? I really like to cycle for more than 5-6 hours, and know that fueling is very important. But for me that is not a problem since I love to eat. I can constantly show down both candy, banana buns an other things when cycling.

This time, the urge to roll over, to drift back into warmth, was overwhelming. I felt as brittle as the autumn light outside, exhausted and reluctant, caught between comfort and ambition.

But there it was‚Äîan insistent thought, almost accusing: I‚Äôve watched myself leap out of bed for deadlines, clients, commuting for someone else‚Äôs dream. Sacrifice has always been easy when the reward belonged to another. For years, I set my alarm to suit the demands of a job, a boss, or expectations that didn‚Äôt reflect the quiet longing inside.

So why is it so hard to do the same for myself? Why, when it‚Äôs my own dream that needs nurturing, does resistance feel so heavy?

I got up anyway. The answer was bitter and freeing: building someone else's vision came naturally. Building my own requires revolt‚Äîa radical act of choosing myself.

With each step to the kitchen, each bruise of tired muscles, I promised that today, I would give my energy, my hours, my best self to my own work. I brewed coffee not as fuel for another chase, but as a symbol of reclaiming my mornings.

So I write. With blurry eyes and a mug warming my hands, I commit to a new truth: my vision matters, my creative labor deserves the sunrise too. I remind myself that the world is built on the dreams of those who finally chose themselves.

My therapist helped me with what to say without explicitly saying it was abuse - basically writing down certain events that really hurt me, and explaining how I experienced them, and why that led to me feeling the way I do now. 

None of what I told him was really new - we‚Äôd been in couples counselling for years, and we‚Äôd been communicating while separated - but he reacted as if this was mind blowing, brand new information. He thought I was being unfair and hurtful, but when I said that I‚Äôm sorry his takeaway from all of it was that my experiences and emotions were hurtful, he changed to ‚Äòhe was just really hurting that I had been hurt.‚Äô Then said that he hated me and I‚Äôd ruined his life. You get the picture.  

His parents live a few hours away and his mum texted me out of the blue that they‚Äôre coming to check in on him, and can we get a coffee just the two of us?

I have no idea how to handle this conversation- based on how she messaged while we were separated, she thinks we can work through this and ‚Äòmarriage is hard work‚Äô. I also know that my partner took in none of what I told him and thay he thinks that I‚Äôm leaving because ‚ÄòI was only with him because he was in a dark place and I was worried about him‚Äô. So I assume this is what he‚Äôs told her. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going to have to ‚Äòmake my case‚Äô with regards to the divorce, but I don‚Äôt particularly want to go through all of the specifics with her, nor do I think she‚Äôll understand my position (emotional abuse isn‚Äôt a thing for her - I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs a full blown narcissist, I‚Äôve both seen it in action and been on the receiving end twice). On the other hand, I know she does care for me (or at least cares for me with her son), so there‚Äôs a very small chance she just wants to see if there is anything to be done. But I‚Äôm doubtful. 

How would you handle/prepare for this conversation?

It was listed for $7,500 with ~160k miles but I was able to negotiate it down to $6,500 due to minor mechanical issues on the front passenger door. It is a 6-speed manual with the Spaceball shifter. The owner is also including a Windows 7 laptop with the OEM VIDA/Dice diagnostic software.

This is the third owner, and the car has a pretty decent record of maintenance. Poly bushings all around, the 4C adaptive suspension system still works and is in good condition, no noticeable issues with the Haldex AWD system, no noticeable leaks, the turbo sounds healthy, and I didn‚Äôt hear any funny sounds from the engine nor the chassis all around. The leather was upholstered by the second owner and has no rips or tears in it. 

It was originally a California car, with a couple years spent in Oregon, and now back in California in the East Bay Area. The first owner was a member of the Volvo Heritage Club as well. I didn‚Äôt spot any rust anywhere on the body, and the cosmetic damage only included small paint chips from rocks and a tiny dent on the rear passenger side quarter panel.

The only aftermarket mods on it are a boost gauge and a catback exhaust from IPD, and a K&N cold air intake. All these mods were done by the second owner, and everything else has been OEM/OEM+. There are no performance mods on it, and I don‚Äôt think any of the owners even tuned it. All the lights work perfectly except for the headlights, which flicker a little while steering. All the wipers operate perfectly as well.

The owner has agreed to take it to a mechanic for a PPI on Monday morning which I will foot the bill for. I doubt any major issues would come up but I figured I would do it just to be safe.

My budget is $10k and I‚Äôm buying this as a daily driver. I commute around 150 miles a week. I was also aiming to modify it just enough to stand out from regular traffic but it already comes with a majority of the mods I was thinking of. I don‚Äôt aim to make any extra power out of it, and I‚Äôm satisfied with the factory horsepower. I just want it to look, sound, and drive good (and maybe turn a couple heads and spark intrigue among other enthusiasts at, lets say, a cars & coffee event :p)

I really can‚Äôt think of any reasons not to pull the trigger on it. It‚Äôs a clean title with no history of any crashes or wrecks, and even had the driver side airbag replaced during the recall. Please tell me if I have missed anything or anything else that I need to look out for from the PPI.

1nmln0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/astoria/comments/1nmln0h/steinway_street/,Steinway Street,"Hello all, 

I'm posting here to ask for some advice. I am a lifelong resident of Astoria and I've always lived on the Steinway side, by what is today referred to as Little Egypt. While I was growing up here, I always heard the stories from old folks about Steinway streets former glory, and while I was sad that most of the stores were closed down from that era when I was growing up, I was never bothered by the empty storefronts and expected some chains to open up.

When the Arab businesses started opening, I was genuinely happy. I‚Äôm Greek, and even though we‚Äôre different religiously, we share many of the same cultural and day-to-day values. Specifically, I love Egyptian people as there are many Egyptians who vacation in Southern Greece (where my parents are from) and a minority of Greeks living in Egypt (who have nothing but good things to say). I was happy to see their new coffee shops and restaurants, and I appreciated that the people who moved here were normal, god fearing people, establishing a place of worship and everything. Even with large groups of men on the street outside of the coffeeshops during the day, I never felt unsafe and was never harassed by them. Ever. Naturally, I love little Egypt during the daytime/weekdays. 

But over the past few years, the nightlife around the hookah lounges has become completely unacceptable... The loud cars and double parking are one thing‚Äîit's annoying asf. But now there are people who are clearly intoxicated, throwing up on the ground, yelling in the streets as late as 5AM. Women are standing slouched over, with tube tops and mini skirts hiked so far that they're whole booty is out (because their so drunk they cant even take a step forward, let alone pull their skirt down). No one is helping them because they've clearly taken something/been drugged. I've personally experienced SO MUCH verbal harassment walking down the street. And recently I've  noticed hookers walking up and down the street now too which the police obviously ignore. There are fights in plain sight of officers. Then when the freakend is over, on Monday morning, Steinway street from 30th to Astoria Blvd is COVERED in trash, both on the sidewalks and on the street. There is a blatant abuse of power going on and I need to figure out how to stop it and don't know where to start. 

Does anyone know the best way to file a complaint or get help with these issues? I‚Äôve tried reaching out to Tiffany Cab√°n, which, I don't even know why I did because this woman couldn't give two sharts about this neighborhood. I don't know why shes our council member at this point. I‚Äôd like to avoid calling the police if possible, because obviously there is some sort of agreement/payment they are receiving from these businesses as to not shut them down. Is there another city agency or community board that deals with this?

P.S. Can we please stop voting in Tiffany Caban into office? ",0,1758439799.0,astoria,1,0.5,False

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm hoping to achieve other than wanting to share this with people and write down what‚Äôs in my head.

Bit of backstory: My last relationship ended in 2019, that was the first time I fell in love and experienced being loved. Since then, I‚Äôve hit it off with a few guys who I came to like but; even when we arrange to meet up, they end up ghosting me before I get the chance to figure out in what way I like them (ie friends, more than friends etc)
In between all of that I‚Äôve had a lot of hookups, mostly with guys who are my type, and not felt anything beyond sexual/physical attraction. 
I know that I identify as somewhere on the aromantic spectrum, but not aromantic itself as I‚Äôve experienced being in love before. 

Anyway, there‚Äôs this guy I bump into in my local queer scene once in a while. We‚Äôve hooked up a few times. The sex is alright, I wouldn‚Äôt say anything special if I‚Äôm being completely honest, but I really enjoy the intimacy with him and doing things to give him pleasure. The last time I saw him at the scene, I had this hunger for him, I guess it was lust. 
I think about him from time to time. And I try to reach out and make conversation, thanking him for a nice time whenever I see him. 

Anyway, last weekend I was on my way home from a day trip out, I stopped off at a service station I usually go to, he saw my profile on Grindr as it‚Äôs near to his town and he invited me over. I‚Äôd only just arrived at the service station but I jumped at the chance to go see this guy. 
I went over, we hooked up and cuddled for a couple hours, and I expressed my interest in getting to know him better. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been thinking about him a fair bit since then. I don‚Äôt know a lot about this guy, but I‚Äôd like to. I know that when I‚Äôm interested in someone I tend to focus on them a lot, I don‚Äôt want to rush into anything due to insecurities due to past relationships and past experiences with friends not respecting my boundaries. 
Anyway, I messaged him in the week as I had some other news I needed to tell him. And at the same time I told him I liked him and asked if he‚Äôd like to go out for a drink or go to a coffee shop sometime. 

He replied pretty quickly, and among his response he said it‚Äôs nice meeting up with me but he‚Äôs not in a place in his life where he‚Äôs looking for anything more serious. 

Now, having had bad experiences with hookups, dating and break ups in the past. I am perfectly okay with this news. Whilst I don‚Äôt fully know his circumstances, I understand and respect them. I still expressed a desire to get to know him better, even as friends, but I understand if he doesn‚Äôt feel like he wants that either or if it‚Äôs not a good idea under the circumstances. 

Anyway, he has a tendency of leaving the last message on unread, which is what‚Äôs happened here, which isn‚Äôt a surprise. I know it‚Äôs still early days since we last spoke, so I‚Äôm just giving him space and leaving the ball in his court. 
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll bump into him at the local scene at somepoint in future, there may be some awkwardness, but as far as I‚Äôm concerned everything is good with him and I, and it would be nice to see him again - sex or no sex. 

The reason I wanted to share this is because: I‚Äôm not good at telling people how I feel about them, I‚Äôm not usually that forward, I‚Äôm not good at inviting someone out like that. So, for me to do that with this guy, the fact that I felt like I wanted to tell this guy, and that I was so sure in myself about it, like that‚Äôs pretty big for me. So even though it hasn‚Äôt worked out with this guy, I‚Äôm taking my actions as a positive from this experience.

I wouldn‚Äôt say I have feelings for this guy at this point, but I know I like him and am into him? Hence why I was interested in taking it slow and getting to know him more - whether that‚Äôs in a dating sense or just as friends (to be fair, I probably wasn‚Äôt that clear with him initially). Ultimately, I‚Äôm fine with his answer, I‚Äôm not hurt or upset by it. I‚Äôm not getting my hopes up that he‚Äôll change his mind in a week or a months time (like some friends have desired of me). I‚Äôm just going to dust myself off and get on with things. 

Anyway, just because things didn‚Äôt work out with this guy, I‚Äôm celebrating the small wins here. The fact that I took a risk in the first place is pretty big for me. 
So yeah, that‚Äôs what I wanted to share.",1,1758439221.0,aromantic,1,1.0,False
1nmlgiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nmlgiw/blurred_lines/,Blurred lines,"I don't know what is happening. Here is how it's been going with my coworker. 

We both work in a secluded section of our workplace, with not many people around. We were not friends, but if we met, we'd say a polite hi. 

She would sometimes give a flirty line out of nowhere in our small talks. I would just ignore it thinking this is a straight girl fooling. I am funny, usually my response to her flirts was insulting banter.

One evening, she was very explicit and clearly flirted on text, I flirted back too. Then onwards,  there was this look we shared where we both knew something is going on but we would just sandwich our flirts in insults. But for some reason she would keep insisting she is only into men, she flirts with everyone. I also came out to her, in case this was silly banter she'd keep it limited to that and not get in too deep. She did minimize her flirting but the vibe and chemistry was still there. At office coffees, her chair would be very close to me.

One day, she asked me if I'd like to join for a movie with her. Through out the week from Tuesday to Friday,  I thought this was a date. On Friday, as we were having lunch at work, another mutual friend joined us for lunch. Now my crush asked her to join in for the movie. The mutual friend sort of realised this was a predecided plan, but I was so pissed at my crush, I forced the mutual friend to join. 

The next week she asked me for another movie (this was a romcom). I asked her to invite her mutual friend. She told me, ""If you wanna call her, you invite her."" And only we both went for the movie. We even sat in the mall after the movie to discuss the movie. The vibes were very romantic but I didn't want to assume anything. 

Next week, she asked me out for another movie. The tickets were booked but I somehow was very stung by her constant ""I like men"" despite flirting with me. She would respond quickly to funny memes I sent, but to the flirty memes she'd have no reaction or she'd stop responding. I somehow thought I should stop being on these date-y situations with her and I backed out of the plan at the last moment, using some excuse. She was very excited for the movie she said she'd take a male coworker, either X or Y. I said take Y, X gives very creepy vibes. She insisted on me telling her why X gives creepy vibes, I asked her why she wanted my opinion on X. She said she wanted to know because she planned to go for dinner with X that week.

Post finding that she planned to go for dinner with X. I completely stopped flirting with her, even if she'd flirt I'd just act like nothing. I stopped sending the memes. I just stopped giving her romantic signs from my side. Since I already came out to her, I was afraid I might be the only one who looks like a fool in love, while she out there is going on dates with guys.  I even avoided her, working at other places other than my work place.

But since we work in the secluded section, there aren't many people around, we keep talking to each other. I decided to keep it strictly platonic and expect no romance here. Recently, there is a lot of unintentional touching. We'd play with the rotatable handles in our chairs and the person standing would also join in the rotation leading to hand touching. I thought maybe I am thinking too much about this and it's probably unintentional fidgetinh. But considering that were never had any physical contact each other before, almost every other day we would be touching each other hands for one reason or the other. I thought maybe me showing her a keychain was my excuse, but she also asked me to shake her hand to show how sweaty her hands are. She also insisted i should listen to snowman by sia. When I said okay fine l will listen to it later, she got her headphones and put it on me and made me listen to it.

Yesterday, we went for another movie. The movie's name translates to ""Favourite woman"". Of course our conversations through our ride to the movie were sandwiches of flirt, insult, deep conversations about life, office gossip everything. The movie ended at 10 pm, she asked me to have dinner with her. Throughout the dinner, she kept talking about her male coworkers who flirt with her etc. but she also said things like, if it wasn't late, we would have have gone for a walk post dinner she'd show me the neighborhood (she used to live there). 

Post dinner, we came out of the restaurant and while we both waited for our uber to arrive. She said something flirty and said ""I don't know why I keep doing this with you"". I was really a bit pissed and I didn't say anything and I just said ""I am really sleepy let's leave"". 

She was visbly distraught by my reaction. We sat in silence for 5 minutes in the taxi. I broke the silence saying, ""I find silence really uncomfortable"". She showed me something on the road, moving a bit closer and for the next 5-10 minutes, our shoulders stayed in contact. She didn't move away, I didn't. Then we did move away somehow, but we had really deep conversations about why we are ""friends"". Of course she kept touching my arm mid conversations (We didn't have any alcohol in our dinner). While she got down at her place, she said, ""you should come over sometime"". I said ""sure if you invite me"".

I keep telling myself there is nothing romantic here, it's just jokes. But the whole date was romantic as hell. And even if I believe her flirts are jokes, her being very distraught post the dinner where I shut her flirts off was very genuine.

The problem is, if I flirt with her and show her signs of my interest, she backs away. But when I completely back off she jumps in creating romantic situations. 

I just don't know what this is. I can't share this with my friends because I am not out and I live in a homophobic country. But all this is just breaking my head.",1,1758439087.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

I was broke, sitting on the floor of my tiny apartment, eating instant noodles out of a coffee mug because I‚Äôd sold my last clean bowl on Facebook Marketplace for $3.

Phone rings. Unknown number. I almost didn‚Äôt answer, but something in me thought, *whatever, maybe it‚Äôs the universe.*

I pick up.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me.‚Äù

It was her. My ex. The one who broke me clean in half. The one who made my Spotify Wrapped look like a breakup therapist‚Äôs nightmare.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. Just two words.

And I laughed, bitter and tired. I said, ‚ÄúSorry doesn‚Äôt pay rent.‚Äù

She laughed back, but softer. ‚ÄúNo. But maybe I can help you *not* starve to death.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt trust it. But then she Venmo‚Äôd me $50 with the caption: *‚ÄòFor bowls that aren‚Äôt mugs.‚Äô*

I wanted to refuse. I wanted to delete her number again. But I didn‚Äôt. Instead, I texted: *‚ÄòStill not enough for rent.‚Äô*

Next morning, another $100. Caption: *‚ÄòFor rent that isn‚Äôt panic.‚Äô*

It became a thing. Not money ‚Äî conversations. Check-ins. Late-night calls. She‚Äôd ask if I‚Äôd eaten. I‚Äôd ask if she was still listening to sad songs in the shower. Slowly, it was less guilt and more‚Ä¶ friendship.

Months passed. I picked myself up. Got a job that didn‚Äôt pay in ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù Moved into a place where bowls stayed bowls.

Then one night, she called again. Same 2:17 AM timing.

‚ÄúDo you hate me?‚Äù she asked.

I said, ‚ÄúNo. I hated the version of you who left. But I don‚Äôt hate the one calling me now.‚Äù

Silence. Then: ‚ÄúDo you want to grab coffee? Just‚Ä¶ not as ghosts anymore?‚Äù

We did. Coffee turned into long walks. Walks turned into laughter again.

And now? No, we didn‚Äôt get back together. That‚Äôs not this story.

But last month, when I finally paid off my debt, she sent me $1 on Venmo with the caption: *‚ÄòFor bowls that are golden.‚Äô*

Growing up I always had herbal tea bags in the house and a kettle. I also found a lot of members in my area did as well. I was surprised to hear there were members reluctant to drink it.

On the other hand my family and many other TBMs seemed to avoid caffeinated soft drinks like coke until leaders indicated caffeine wasn't the issue. More they seem to consume these drinks without any concern.

I'm also curious if those growing up with herbal tea had an easier time adjusting to tea after leaving. I found since I was already used to drinking herbal tea it was an easy adjustment making ""real tea"" at home.

I‚Äôm offering a special package of French lessons for children (ages 6‚Äì17):

	‚Ä¢	Where: Cebu city ‚Äì face-to-face at a coffee shop, or online via google meet or FaceTime.

 (Although I prefer face to face classes since kids have a shorter attention span) 

	‚Ä¢	Rate: ‚Ç±3,500 for 10 hours (introductory rate)

	‚Ä¢	Focus: Building a foundation in French (reading, speaking, listening, and some culture)

	‚Ä¢	In exchange: I‚Äôd just ask for an honest review of your child‚Äôs learning experience

What will you get ?

- Customized lessons based on your child‚Äôs and level of proficiency.

- Worksheets and other supporting materials.

- Practice with a native speaker to help improve pronunciation.

What should you expect after 10hours with me ?

- Results may defer from person to person but :

After the first 10 hours, you or your child will:

- Greet in French with confidence.

- Count up to 20.

- Recognize and name several colors.

- Introduce themselves (name + age).

- Sing simple songs in French (alphabet, numbers, colors).

- Understand a few everyday classroom commands.

It‚Äôs like opening the door  you won‚Äôt be fluent yet, but they‚Äôll feel comfortable, playful, and confident with French basics.

Adults are also welcome! Specifically complete beginners based in Cebu city. 

If you‚Äôd like your child or yourself to start learning French in a fun and approachable way, feel free to reach out.

Au plaisir d‚Äô√©changer,

I cook simple meals, like hiking and quiet walks, enjoy stargazing, and I'd pick museums and caf√©s over parties any day. I used to game a lot; now it's Genshin once in a while.

1nmkwky,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuySmartHQ/comments/1nmkwky/do_espresso_machines_last_longer_than_drip/,Do espresso machines last longer than drip machines?,"When evaluating whether espresso machines last longer than drip coffee makers, the key lies in examining the mechanical complexity, build quality, and maintenance requirements of each system. Both types of brewers can last many years, but their lifespan is strongly influenced by their design and upkeep.

Espresso machines‚Äîespecially mid-range and high-end models‚Äîare often engineered with more durable components. Many feature brass or stainless-steel boilers, commercial-grade pumps, and replaceable gaskets, which can endure thousands of extraction cycles if properly maintained. Semi-automatic and manual lever machines, in particular, have fewer electronic parts and can last over a decade, with some exceeding 15‚Äì20 years in use when serviced regularly. Their longevity, however, comes with the expectation of routine descaling, backflushing, and occasional replacement of wear parts.

Drip coffee makers are generally simpler devices, but their longevity is highly dependent on price point. Basic consumer-grade drip brewers are often built with lower-cost heating elements, plastic tubing, and limited serviceability. These machines typically last between 3‚Äì5 years before performance declines, often due to clogs from scale buildup or failure of the heating plate. High-end drip brewers, such as those certified by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), use more robust components and may last closer to 8‚Äì10 years with descaling and proper use.

In professional environments, where equipment is subject to heavy daily use, espresso machines demonstrate a clear advantage. A commercial machine, with routine servicing, can remain in operation for decades, while drip brewers used in offices often need replacement every few years. The difference is partially because espresso machines are designed with maintenance in mind‚Äîmost parts are modular and replaceable‚Äîwhereas drip brewers are frequently considered disposable appliances.

In conclusion, espresso machines generally have a longer potential lifespan than drip coffee makers, provided they receive proper care. For consumers seeking a long-term investment, choosing a well-built espresso machine or a high-end drip brewer and committing to a maintenance routine is the most effective way to maximize longevity.",1,1758437039.0,BuySmartHQ,0,1.0,False

I have a lot of insecurities about my appearance, and I‚Äôm looking for some honest perspectives from both men and women in this community.

I'm 156 cm (5'1"") and currently weigh 76 kg. At my heaviest, I was 90 kg, and at my lowest, I was 65 kg. I've had so many weight fluctuations over the past five years that I've gotten stretch marks on almost every part of my body. I'm feeling a lot of shame about what I've done to myself. I'm also dusky, and  I know how much preference is given to lighter, ""fair"" skin when it comes to arranged marriage.

I've been on a weight loss journey before, and honestly, losing weight isn't the problem for me. I can do it. The real issue is that even if I get back to a good weight, the stretch marks will still be there.

I've heard stories of people meeting their groom for coffee or a talk before the families get too involved, but I don't think that's going to happen with me. My family is very traditional and doesn't believe in a girl and a guy talking before the families have decided everything. This makes me even more anxious.

I recently heard a story about a relative of mine. A groom saw her photo and was okay with it, but when he met her in real life, he said no because he didn't find her attractive due to her acne and the fact that she wore glasses. She is dusky, like me, but in perfect shape. Then, I've also heard of fair-skinned, thin girls getting married even with a lot of acne, simply because they were fair and thin. It makes me so confused about what really matters. I am confident that if I lose the weight, I will look good, at least to myself, but the stretch marks are the only thing that will remain.

I personally don't care about a man's looks; I believe in comfort and connection over physical appearance. The thought of discussing my stretch marks with a groom in our first meeting seems complicated and embarrassing.

So, my questions for all of you are:

* For men: How important are things like stretch marks or skin complexion (dusky vs. fair) to you in an arranged marriage setting? Would this be a reason to say no to a woman, especially if everything else about her personality and family is a good match?
* For women: Have any of you dealt with similar insecurities? How did you handle them during the arranged marriage process? Did you disclose your stretch marks, and if so, when and how?
* For everyone: Am I overthinking this? What's the best way for me to approach this situation? Should I bring it up to a potential groom, and if so, at what stage?

I appreciate any and all honest advice and experiences. Thank you for listening.",12,1758436968.0,InsideIndianMarriage,9,1.0,False

She would not stop and let me buy myself food instead insisting I eat the items she brought.  I do not particularly like those items. Anytime I bring up a restaurant, she said she felt pressured to eat and that it would make her sick. I never ment to pressure her into eating. She then chose another restaurant, and ordered a sandwich. I paid of course I am not a total lout. The rest of the trip I managed to find a smoothie shop that worked really quickly while she occupied with shopping.
    Tonight she got upset that I was not enjoying the plays. I mean they are nice but not my thing. I try to talk to her about them or works by the same authors but she seems agitated when I try. I am just lost on how to make her happy.....AITH?

Basically running on coffee and willpower (and yes, it feels like I‚Äôm 50 on the inside). I‚Äôm hoping to connect with people around my age who enjoy sharing stories, swapping life highlights, and just getting to know someone new.

I married my high school sweetheart early on so I‚Äôm not looking for anything romantic, just genuine conversation and friendship. Over the years I‚Äôve traveled across the U.S., lived in other countries, and collected plenty of interesting experiences that I‚Äôd love to trade stories about. I‚Äôm naturally introverted except for when I‚Äôm working so I‚Äôm curious to see how this all goes. 

Because my schedule leaves little room for in-person socializing, I figured this pen-pal adventure could be the perfect way to stay connected and build friendships. If you‚Äôre up for casual chats about life, travels, or whatever‚Äôs on your mind I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Did I type out something and then enhance it with ChatGPT?

1nmkrwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuySmartHQ/comments/1nmkrwy/which_coffee_maker_brews_fastest/,Which coffee maker brews fastest?,"In evaluating which coffee maker delivers the fastest brew, the discussion needs to move beyond anecdotal claims and into measurable performance data. Brew speed is influenced by three main variables: water heating technology, brew volume, and extraction method. Understanding these allows for a more precise recommendation.

Single-serve pod systems, such as Keurig‚Äôs K-Supreme Plus SMART, consistently demonstrate the fastest brew cycle for a standard 8 oz cup, often completing in under 60 seconds once the machine is preheated. Their thermoblock heating systems bring water to optimal temperature nearly on demand, resulting in minimal wait time between cups. However, this speed comes with a trade-off: extraction quality may be less robust compared to slower methods, particularly for those seeking specialty coffee profiles.

Thermal carafe drip systems with advanced heating elements, such as the BUNN Velocity Brew GR or the Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV, represent the fastest full-pot options. BUNN‚Äôs internal hot water tank design allows it to brew a 10-cup pot in approximately 3 minutes, significantly faster than conventional drip brewers that average 5‚Äì8 minutes. This design is particularly suited for commercial or high-volume home use where consecutive pots are brewed throughout the day.

For those who value both speed and espresso-quality extraction, super-automatic espresso machines with dual thermoblocks (e.g., Jura E8) offer a practical solution. These units can pull a double shot in under 90 seconds while steaming milk simultaneously, making them efficient for busy mornings.

In practical terms, the ‚Äúfastest‚Äù system depends on context: pod systems dominate single-cup speed, BUNN-style reservoirs lead in multi-cup output, and high-end automatics excel in combining speed with espresso-based versatility. Users should balance brew speed with taste preferences, maintenance requirements, and intended daily volume when selecting a machine.",1,1758436550.0,BuySmartHQ,0,1.0,False
1nmkrne,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nmkrne/how_to_descale_an_electric_kettle_safely/,How to descale an electric kettle safely?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with descaling electric kettles since I've learned a lot about this over the years. I know it might sound like a boring topic, but trust me - if you want your kettle to last longer and your tea/coffee to taste better, this is pretty important stuff.

I recently got a new electric kettle from https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle and it got me thinking about how many people don't know the proper way to maintain these appliances. Those white, chalky deposits (limescale) can really mess up your kettle and affect the taste of your beverages.

Here's my foolproof method for descaling:

1. Vinegar Solution Method (My Go-To):
- Mix equal parts white vinegar and water
- Fill your kettle halfway
- Boil the mixture
- Let it sit for 20 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly (like, really thoroughly)

2. Citric Acid Method (If you hate the vinegar smell):
- Add 1-2 tablespoons of citric acid to a full kettle
- Boil and let sit for 15 minutes
- Rinse well

Pro Tips I've Learned:
- Descale every 1-2 months if you have hard water
- Never use harsh chemicals
- Always rinse multiple times
- Don't let the solution sit overnight (can damage the heating element)

I've tried both commercial descalers and natural methods, but honestly, the vinegar method works best for me. Speaking of kettles, if you're in the market for a new one, check out these great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle - I particularly love the ones with temperature control for different types of tea.

Prevention Tips:
- Use filtered water when possible
- Don't leave water sitting in the kettle
- Wipe the interior dry when not in use
- Empty after each use

The key is consistency - regular maintenance will prevent heavy buildup that's harder to remove. Plus, it keeps your drinks tasting great and your kettle working efficiently.

I'd love to hear your descaling methods or any questions you might have. It's amazing how something so simple can make such a big difference in your daily coffee or tea routine!",1,1758436523.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Usually, my coffee turns out cloudier when I brew using James Hoffmann‚Äôs method with a finer grind. I figure this is probably due to uneven particle size from my grinder (a Timemore Chestnut C3S, which was recommended to me as one of the best price-to-quality options for beginner coffee enthusiasts). I understand that some inconsistency is normal for grinders in this price range, but I‚Äôd like to know how ‚Äúoff‚Äù my brews might be. What level of cloudiness is still within the normal range? (The haze, by the way, seems to get worse as the coffee cools.)

The flavor notes are still easy to pick out regardless of the haze, and today‚Äôs cup though far from crystal clear tasted great to me. Maybe that‚Äôs just my inexperience?

5. On a piece of paper, wrote our full names in a way that they formed a cross, folded it thrice towards me and tied it around the candles with some red ribbon.

Alt text: Business professionals discussing company formation in an office in Bahrain.](https://www.forbes.com/business/), Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil sector is projected to grow by 4.7% this year, outpacing regional rivals. Reuters reported in Q1 2025 that FDI inflows hit a record high of $1.75 billion, with free zone companies making up nearly 40% of new registrations (Reuters, June 2025).\
Most entrepreneurs choose free zones for:\
- 100% foreign ownership rights (details here)\
- Tax-free business structures\
- Streamlined licensing through platforms like Sijilat\
- Fast-track visas via the LMRA\
- Strategic locations‚Äîthink Bahrain Bay, Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP), and the up-and-coming Tatweer Petroleum Free Zone\
Bahrain‚Äôs free zones are uniquely flexible compared to UAE or KSA. Office setups in major zones‚ÄîBIIP, Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ), and the new Salman Industrial City Free Zone‚Äîcater to a wide range of budgets and business models.\

Popular Bahrain free zone entity types:\
- WLL (With Limited Liability)\
- Branch of a Foreign Company\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC)\
Ownership rules are liberally pro-business. Since the 2023-2024 reforms (enforced from February 1, 2025), most sectors now allow up to 100% foreign ownership‚Äîeven for professional services, e-commerce, and fintech (sector list). Certain regulated industries (banks, telecoms) require EDB or CBB approval.\

Startup desks (coworking): from BHD 800/year\
Private offices (20‚Äì40 m¬≤): BHD 2,800‚Äì4,200/year\
\
\
Add 10% for premium waterfront or Bahrain Bay towers; subtract 5-15% for inland or ground floor units.\
\

\
What‚Äôs Included in Free Zone Office Rental?\
\
Standard lease terms: 1-5 years (negotiable)\
Free zone amenities: business lounges, meeting rooms, security, and car parking\
Utilities: often included for SME units; metered for large custom spaces\
IT: Fiber internet packages from BHD 25/month\
\
Hidden Costs and Budget Protections\
\
Free zone registration fees: BHD 150‚Äì400 (one-off, depends on zone)\
MOICT commercial registration: BHD 100‚Äì270 (annual renewal)\
Visa costs: BHD 250‚Äì420/employee (expat quota via LMRA)\
Furnished offices: +10-20% premium\
Mandatory insurance: BHD 60‚Äì120/year\
\
Importantly, some free zones (notably BIIP) require three months‚Äô rent upfront as deposit. Budget for legal translations (MOICT demands all documents in Arabic), which can run BHD 40-80 per document.\

3. Prepare Application Documents in Advance\
\
Required: Passport copies, CR application, business plan, lease pre-approval, sector licenses, Arabic translations of key documents.\
Insider shortcut: Use the Sijilat portal for pre-filling forms. Saves hours of waiting at MOICT.\
\
4. Apply for Commercial Registration (Sijilat)\
\
Submit all docs to MOICT (often in the Diplomatic Area government complex).\
Office lease approval is a prerequisite!\
Tip: Midweek mornings are fastest; Sunday is slow (everyone‚Äôs at majlis coffee or prayer).\
\
5. Complete Free Zone Lease Formalities\
\
Sign in person, sometimes with a Tamkeen or zone official present as witness.\
Pay deposit + 1st year rent.\
\
6. Activate Utilities and LMRA Labor Quota\
\
Electricity, water, and internet‚Äîsubmit at the same time as lease signing.\
LMRA labor quota takes 3-7 business days if all paperwork is perfect.\
\
7. Move In and Launch\
\
Remember, Ramadan business hours may shorten office access by 2-3 hours/day. Plan your move accordingly!\
\
Real-world challenge: When I set up in Seef, I underestimated the time for Arabic document translations‚Äîdelaying my LMRA quota by a week. Now, I only use accredited translators with same-day service.\
Bahrain Free Zone Rentals vs. UAE and Saudi: What Sets Bahrain Apart?\
\
Alt text: Modern office building showing Bahrain‚Äôs unique business environment.).\
- Lower rents: Average rental is 20-35% less than equivalent UAE free zones.\
- Faster setup: Sijilat and MOICT are genuinely digital. Most UAE/KSA zones still require in-person signatures and physical stamps.\
- Business culture: Bahrain embraces both formal contracts and traditional majlis networking. Unexpected bonus: Some landlords serve gahwa (traditional coffee) during lease signings, a gesture of goodwill.\
2025 Regulatory Updates: New Policies Affecting Free Zone Rentals\
Effective April 1, 2025:\
- All new free zone tenants must submit a digital office plan to the MOICT for fire and safety compliance (previously, only for spaces over 100 m¬≤).\
- Lease deposits are now capped at 4 months‚Äô rent (down from 6) in most zones, freeing up startup cash flow.\
Don‚Äôt forget to check official guidelines for the latest requirements.\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Ongoing Obligations\
\

- Maintain local accounting records (Arabic and English permitted)\
- Complete annual workforce reports for LMRA\
My best resource? Keylink‚Äôs accounting and bookkeeping services. Their cloud dashboard saved me a full week of paperwork at financial year-end.\
Common pitfall: Missing the annual renewal deadline with the MOICT. This can freeze your bank account‚Äîset calendar alerts and use a local consultant if needed!\
Local Business Culture: Insider Tips for a Smooth Setup\
Surprisingly, the fastest way to move your lease along is by inviting your landlord or free zone official for coffee‚Äîeven better if it‚Äôs in a majlis. Bahrain favors relationships, and a face-to-face can resolve issues that would take days via email.\
\
Expect shorter working hours and relaxed deadlines during Ramadan.\
Bring a modest gift (dates or sweets) if meeting at someone‚Äôs majlis post-contract.\
\
And‚Äîsomething many guides miss: always double-check the spelling of your company name in Arabic on every document. One missed letter can force a re-registration (speaking from painful experience in the Diplomatic Area MOICT branch).\
Professional Support: Who to Work With\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: consultation for Bahrain company formation..\
Their team has prioritized my applications during peak periods, caught critical errors in Arabic documents, and even walked me into a last-minute Sijilat slot once when my bank guarantee was about to expire.\
Using a pro service saves time, prevents regulatory headaches, and gives you direct answers‚Äîespecially for expats unfamiliar with Bahrain-specific paperwork.\

\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Free Zone Rentals\
1. How much capital is required to set up a free zone company in Bahrain?\
Minimum capital varies by activity and legal form. SPCs and WLLs in service sectors require as little as BHD 1,000‚Äì5,000. Industrial and logistics activities may require BHD 20,000+ shown in bank reference letters.\
Full cost details: Bahrain company formation cost\
2. Can I use a virtual office address for my free zone company?\
Yes, but only in selected zones like BLZ and Salman Free Zone. MOICT recently tightened rules: business activities that involve physical trading or customer visits require dedicated office space. See latest rules.\
3. What are the best months to apply for free zone office rental?\
April‚ÄìJune and October‚ÄìDecember. Avoid Ramadan for faster processing‚Äîgovernment offices and landlords take longer to respond during the holy month.\
4. Does Bahrain allow 100% foreign ownership in all free zone activities?\
Almost‚Äîall except a short list of regulated sectors (banking, telecoms, national security).\
See allowed activities and ownership rules.\
5. How do I renew my commercial registration and free zone lease?\
\
Set up automatic reminders 4-6 weeks before expiry.\
Use Keylink‚Äôs compliance services for annual filings and renewals.\
Submit renewal forms online via Sijilat‚Äîin-person not usually required!\

1nmkj48,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedLetterMedia/comments/1nmkj48/twin_peaks_fire_walk_with_me_dale_and_chet_should/,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me     Dale and Chet Should Have Been the Same Character,"I really enjoy the original series Twin Peaks.  I wouldn't call myself a superfan, but I've seen the original series three times over the years.  I don't like the Fire Walk With Me movie and I really found the third season disappointing, because it went on and on introducing hordes of new characters who seemed to exist for nothing more than slowing the main narrative to a snail's pace and then vanishing abruptly.  There are some amazing scenes in a lot of these episodes, and I really really wanted to like it, but I couldn't.  I just couldn't get past things like the five-minute shot of a janitor sweeping a floor.  (I don't know if it was actually that long, but it certainly felt like it.)

I've seen Fire Walks with me twice.  The second time I saw it, the fact that Chester Desmond shouldn't have existed as a character at all really jumped out at me. 

I'm aware that there was some behind-the-scenes drama with Kyle MacLachlan being reluctant to being tied to the role of Dale Cooper for three more movies, and that led to Lynch introducing a new character as a failsafe in case MacLachlan didn't want to stick around for the trilogy.  

Ok, so introduce Dale Cooper and the New Guy, that's a given.  Nope, instead Lynch introduces us to the New Guy and the Other New Guy, and it's about forty-five minutes until we see Dale Cooper at  all.  (That's my best guess, and I'm not watching it again to check.)  Completely relegating the main character to a side character like that seems almost like a deliberately suicidal decision by Lynch.  

The really weird thing is that the character of Chester Desmond seems to have been written as a Dale Cooper standin, but *Dale Cooper is already in the movie as a major character!*  It's such a baffling decision it makes my head spin.  I have nothing against Chris Isaak, I think I he did great, but I don't think his character should have existed at all.  

The one scene that really sticks in my head is Chet's confrontation with the Deer Meadow police force.  Deer Meadow is the opposite of Twin Peaks, the local police are hostile to the FBI and try to run them out they show up.  Chet puts the deputy in an extremely painful hold and burts past him to the sheriff.  The second, I watched it, I kept on imagining Dale Cooper in the scene and what it would have meant for the series.  

Dale Cooper gets along with the Twin Peaks police department because they're genuinely nice people and wonderful to go out with for coffee and cherry pie, but when he's confronted at the Deer Meadow police department, he busts some shit up to get his way.  That would have been some new, darker characterization on Dale Cooper and would cast him in a different light.  But no, it's Chet, the new protagonist introduced for no reason, providing that Keifer Sutherland's Sam Stanley was obviously supposed to be the backup character!

The concept of Chet Desmond existing at all completely bewilders me.  No wonder I don't like post-original Twin Peaks, Lynch needed someone to reel him in order to make this show.  When he didn't have that anymore, everything turned into a weird, strung-out mess.  

  
This is just my opinion.  If you disagree with me, I forgive you for being wrong.

So my divorce finalized yesterday, my ex and I have been separated for 6 months and frankly the marriage was over for years beforehand. After we split i came out as lesbian rather than bi, and it was received well by family and I decided that i would take at least a year off from dating to work on myself and building my community of new friends (the marriage was very controlling etc so I did not have much social life besides family). I had downloaded bumble bff in the past and just never really used it up until now but ive met some cool girls on there and we've hit it off (platonically).

Until one girl matched with me and said that she matched with me on the dating side of bumble as well and wanted to know what lane she should stay in bc she was interested and I'm like ??? Gay panicking because she is gorgeous, seems really cool from her profile, and has random very niche connections to one of my favorite local (to me) spots. I didn't realize that I even had a date account let alone a live one but apparently Bumble has been known to have weird glitches like that. She asked me out for coffee or the like and is hoping to see me before she goes out of town for a couple weeks on business. I am very tempted to say yes.

1nmki70,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverfood/comments/1nmki70/lets_talk_about_velvet_lasso/,let‚Äôs talk about Velvet Lasso,"Hello! It has come to my attention that a new restaurant is opening in Denver sometime in the Fall of this year called Velvet Lasso (@velvetlassolounge on IG). I figured I would share some information about who exactly is behind this new spot and what you can expect, as a customer, and even as an employee. Velvet Lasso is owned by Bree Licata and entirely funded by her billionaire father who has made his fortune off of the coal industry. This is not a small business in the slightest, but Bree will claim it is to bring people in. 

Bree is only opening Velvet Lasso in DENVER because her last venture, a bakery in Portland called Flour Bloom, failed so horribly that she has been blacklisted from the industry here. There are no good connotations in this city with the names Flour Bloom or Bree Licata. Many of the reasons Flour Bloom failed can be found on r/portland by searching ‚Äúflour bloom‚Äù, and i believe there is some other stuff under a subreddit made by ex-employees called r/fuckyouflourbloom. There are also several tiktoks that summarize all of this that I‚Äôm sure you can find by searching like ‚Äúflour bloom portland closing‚Äù or ‚Äúflour bloom portland drama‚Äù, I can‚Äôt link any as I don‚Äôt use tiktok myself but the information is everywhere. Pretty much everything I‚Äôm saying below can be found in these tiktoks and reddit posts but I figured I would put it here too for those that don‚Äôt want to search!

Flour Bloom failed for many reasons. For one, Bree always cared more about the aesthetic and how the Flour Bloom ‚Äúbrand‚Äù looked than the actual product she was trying to sell- please keep this in mind if you decide to give Velvet Lasso a chance. She claimed all of the little art and products we sold in store that weren‚Äôt Flour Bloom brand were from local artists, many of the products came from Temu. The food was over priced and never once in the 2ish years it was open was the food (baked goods or sandwiches from the back kitchen) ever worth the price. I have never had a job I told my loved ones not to bother coming in to before except Flour Bloom. The only part that was ever worth it was the coffee and that was entirely because of the wonderful baristas that worked there. WE always tried our best as employees despite never being setup for success.

Bree took credit for everything, even calling herself the head baker even though she never once made a single thing inside that building- food or coffee. She was so far removed that she didn‚Äôt realize for MONTHS when the baking team stopped using her recipes because they were not good and they did not sell, yet she was quick to tell the news she was Head Baker even though we actually had someone with that title. Technically, according to the emails that Bree sent herself her title was ‚ÄúHBIC‚Äù. She told the news that she was SUCH a good boss that she gave one of her employees maternity leave; what she actually did was fire the father of the child and deny the mother maternity leave. She yelled at employees in the office that was all the way in the back of the restaurant so loudly you could hear it from the front doors - mind you this was not a small building in the slightest and music was always playing. She would frequently tell employees that she was such a good boss because she wasn‚Äôt paying herself to gain kudos with us and constantly denied raises because there was ‚Äúno money‚Äù and then brought in things we never needed like nicer versions of hoodies we already had that did not sell and a brand new $10,000 mixer we did not need and ended up selling maybe 2-3 months later. Instead of putting the money in places that would have made the business last, she put a lot of it into a mystical medical fund for the kitchen manager that did literally nothing, instead of hiring someone that could actually keep the kitchen running. They then would try to hire a ‚Äúlead line cook‚Äù to do all of the duties 
the KM should have been doing for a fraction of the price.

Flour Bloom closed a total of 3 times before she finally called it quits (or rather- her father‚Äôs money stopped coming in). 2 of those times they closed due to a toxic work environment and tried to hire a whole new staff to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the issues. When it finally closed for the third and final time, Bree blamed the closure entirely on the community of Portland for not ‚Äúshowing up‚Äù for a business that gave nothing to show up for. In classic Bree fashion she went off on and even blocked most people that disagreed. Mind you, when Flour Bloom was open she was banned from having access to the IG of her own business because she could not control her outbursts. She‚Äôs a 34/35 year old woman, not a child. She‚Äôs claims she‚Äôs allowed to have outbursts whether it‚Äôs online or to your face as your boss because of her neurodivergence and she will never apologize for this behavior. She has never once acknowledged that any of her actions or choices were responsible for the failure that was Flour Bloom. Please keep that in mind as well if you choose to give Velvet Lasso a chance. 

Working at Flour Bloom felt like being in high school more than it ever felt like an actual job. Each day we showed up unsure if we were in the good graces of management or not and it was always VERY apparent if you weren‚Äôt. They encouraged gossip and drama and loved pitting us against each other when they could. Bree was actively offended when the cooks and baristas wouldn‚Äôt invite her to things outside of work and she took it out on us. She does not know how to be professional in any sense and in my honest opinion as someone who has been in the food industry for a while, she has absolutely no business being the boss of ANYBODY. 

Obviously I implore you all to form your own opinions, and if that means giving Velvet Lasso a chance, by all means. But it wouldn‚Äôt sit right with me or anybody else in Portland that had to deal with the storm that is Bree Licata if this information was kept from those of you that will soon have to deal with her as well!
