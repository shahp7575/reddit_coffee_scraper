I've been trying to reverse engineer the flavor profile based on beans, but I hit a massive wall. I saw a demonstration of an Al that can identify faces. I used face seek on a tiny, blurry photo of the barista who invented the original blend (I found the photo on an old news article about Nespresso blend development).

I was hoping to find the guy's current job or private coffee blog so I could beg him for the blend details. The search failed to find his current location, but it did link his face to three anonymous profiles that only post about obscure, non-coffee-related food science. The flavor secret is safe, but the lack of digital footprint for a guy that talented is weird. Has anyone else ever gone this far to find a coffee blend?",1,1764937460.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1petqjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1petqjb/she_didnt_change/,She didn't change,"I have been low contact with my mother for several years, partially because she found other supply, my job has kept me busy, and partially by choice. It took me years to get over the abuse I received, to heal, and to forgive her. In the past I've had long periods of no contact as a result of the BS she pulled. I thought she had changed. It was all a manipulation to pull me back in. Recently she has put on the full court press in an attempt to get financial help and advice, and to position me as her caregiver. Her health is deteriorating and she has blown most of her money with extravagant spending and trying to compete with the women in her friend group. I mistakenly offered to look at her financial situation, and she's well and truly fkd. She inherited a large sum of money from her Dad and Aunt, and there won't be anything left to even take care of her affairs.  She is going to be destitute in 3.5 years unless she drastically cuts spending. I have already told her before, I will not give her money. (When I was a kid she used to steal money my father gave to me by going through my things while I slept)

She had serious back surgery recently, and I offered to help. I took more than a week off of work, took her to her appointments, paid for parking, brought her food, coffee, paid for Ubers, and became her house keeper. Then the mask came off. The guilt trips started again, and I was in her apartment cleaning up dog shit, while she ridiculed, guilt tripped, complained, and treated me like a slave. I was sent back in time and I remembered, this is the same woman that put our dog to sleep the time I went no contact at 16.",1,1764937452.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Thoughts?,"I just pushed a new idea-scoring feature into my project [SaaSThink](https://www.saasthink.app), and now I’m not sure if the scoring logic actually makes sense or if I just hallucinated confidence at 1am.

The concept is simple: type in a niche/problem and it scores how promising it is based on demand, trends, competition, etc. It sounded great in theory. But now that it’s live, I’m second-guessing everything.

For example: someone tried **“coffee subscription for remote teams”** and it scored surprisingly high… even though my quick research says barely anyone is looking for that.

  
Meanwhile, another niche with real search volume got a pretty average score. So now I’m wondering if it’s the inputs, the weighting, or just me pretending I understand markets better than I actually do.

It’s live and **free to try**... no DM needed.  
If anyone wants to poke at it, test a few niches, or just tell me whether the scoring feels useful, I’d seriously appreciate it.

If you’re up for deeper testing or more detailed feedback, DM me and I’ll send the tester coupon code in order to try the full analysis mode.

We really like the Siemens for its quietness and the fact that it uses a little hose for the milk. However in the category that actually matters, it lacks enormously. The coffee, and especially the cappuccino, is really weak. Even with the strongest setting (apart from the doubleshot setting), it is weaker than even the middle strength setting of the De'Longhi.

Now, I have found a deal for an EQ700 for around the same price as our EQ6. However, I haven't found any review or comparison yet on the actual difference in coffee strength/quality. I have found that it uses a different brewing unit, but that's about it.

First flareup happened a week after my last dosage.

My first flareup triggered a panic attack and an intense vasovagal response that's made me feel like I'm about to pass out (got checked with a cardio 3 times and all labs came out fine). This happened repeatedly for a month where the acid reflux and general abdomen discomfort got worse and worse every flareup. I decided to go for an endoscopy and was diagnosed with mild gastritis/GERD. Around this time, I also stopped working out and exercising in general because any hint of tiredness/palpitations would trigger the panic attack associated with my first flareup.

4 months have passed and I've gotten better since then (I can now drink coffee and eat food that would back then trigger a flareup if I had a spoon of it). I can now also go for long walks and runs on a good day. I figured I could give lifting a try again and decided I'd do a light PPL for the week. Push/pull days went just fine and I did them on an emptier stomach. However, after doing 3 sets of Bulgarian split squats some 2 hours after my lunch, I started feeling nauseous, bloated, and warm in the face alongside an acid reflux kicking in.

A month before the events of The Division 2, Charlotte, North Carolina is relatively peaceful. But peace never lasts...

  
**CHAPTER ONE - RUDE AWAKENING**

**April 7, 2016, 9:20am**  
**Checkpoint Sycamore, Charlotte, North Carolina**

The morning was mild and gray as SHD agents Mateo Cruz and Soo Park stepped out of the Humvee into a scene that had become routine these days. Checkpoint Sycamore was the last JTF checkpoint before entering the unpatrolled regions outside the city. Before the dollar flu, it had been a strip mall off of the interstate, now it had been commandeered into an inspection station for vehicles entering and leaving the city. Despite its militarisation - sandbags and fencing boarding the parking lot - the checkpoint had a relaxed atmosphere. After the initial chaos of the outbreak and disorder, Charlotte had settled quickly.

A battered radio played cheesy pop music from a local amateur station, loud enough to be heard over engines rumbling. Convoy drivers leaned on truck bumpers, trading gossip while sipping weak coffee and smoking. JTF troopers lounged near the barricades, joking half-heartedly as they waited for the next vehicle in line. The chaos of the outbreak felt distant here; Charlotte had carved out a fragile sense of calm, and everyone at Checkpoint Sycamore moved with the casual confidence of people who believed things were finally under control.

“Rain later,” Mateo said as he slung his carbine. “Ten bucks says it hits before noon.”

Soo didn’t bite. She’d been on medical rotation all week, treating the various cuts and bruises, chronic conditions, and frayed nerves spreading through Charlotte. A former EMT, she’d been visiting field clinics across the city daily.

Across the parking lot she spotted the crowd already forming around the CERA medical tents. The local medical team were ushering people in and working to alleviate the various ailments already. Soo unloaded her medical kit bag and started over to join them.

As she made her way to the tents, soldiers and civilians alike waved and greeted her. Everyone knew her, and she knew them. Mateo watched her for a moment, then made for the storefront-turned-command post where Captain White worked.



Mateo radioed in to report their arrival, then walked into the office supply store that now housed the command post for Checkpoint Sycamore. Captain Adrian White, a broad-shouldered man with the kind of calm only found in overworked officers, was inside with a group of JTF personnel. Mateo heard White laugh deeply then send them on their way, before greeting him.

“Morning Mateo! Coffee?”

“Please,” said Mateo, accepting the offer. He liked White. The man was steady, fair and sharp beneath the exhaustion. “Slow morning?”

Captain White poured a cup each and passed one to Mateo. “Slow’s good. If this is the new normal, I’ll take it! But the last convoy returning from D.C. ran into trouble - lead driver said they were stopped north of the railyard. Claimed some militia-types tried to shake them down. Said it got heated until they realized the trucks were empty.”

“Colours? Patches?” Mateo asked.

“Nothing clear,” White shrugged. “You might want to speak to Richardson. He’s heading north again today.”

Mateo thought over the most recent intel reports. They’d been pretty standard; gang activity, the usual.

Before Mateo could reply, the captain’s belt radio sputtered:

“*Cargo inspection. Senior officer required. We’ve got an uncooperative driver.*”

Captain White sighed, “every damn morning.”

Mateo smirked, waving him back into his seat, lifting his cup. “I’ll go. Let me earn this coffee.”

He stood, shook the captain’s hand, and headed out. Across the street, he spotted Soo tending to a patient at the medical tents before resuming his path to the indignant trucker.



Across the lot, Agent Soo Park was stitching up a man in a torn jacket. She did her best not to move his arm as she cut away the sleeve. Speaking to him in their mutual Korean, she admonished him.

“You know civilians are advised not to go into the northern districts, Min. There are still gangs up there, and no patrols. You’re lucky that bullet only grazed you.”

“I wasn’t looking for trouble! It wasn’t a gang! They were soldiers!” replied Min, wincing as Soo removed his grubby makeshift bandage.

“Soldiers? *Jinjja?*” queried Soo.

“Yeah! Not scavengers! Camouflage clothes and rifles! There was a patrol, maybe six guys. They saw me and shot at me! It wasn’t a gang!”

Soo looked concerned as she finished binding his arm. After he left, she tapped her Division-issue smartwatch and entered a report on what Min had told her. As soon as she finalised it, ISAC, the built-in AI, notified her of a related report - Mateo’s note about Captain White’s convoy incident.

Glancing across the street, she saw Mateo speaking with a pair of JTF soldiers, their stance tense. Something was escalating. Once they finished here, the agents would check in with the BOO to determine how to proceed - probably a recon patrol toward the north. They could travel up with the departing convoy. She frowned and moved on to the next patient.



Mateo was getting briefed by one of White’s corporals, Kahler. They’d been conducting routine checks on the next convoy vehicle, a nondescript box truck. The driver had been cooperative at first, until they asked to inspect the cargo. The man had grown argumentative, insisting that he had to get going. Since the convoy couldn’t depart until Captain White confirmed, it didn’t make sense, so they had radioed in.

Mateo thanked the soldiers and approached the driver: a wiry, bald man with sunken eyes and the kind of defiance born of arrogance, arguing with another JTF guard.

“Morning, “ he said, voice calm, “Agent Cruz, Division. What’s the issue?”

The trucker turned on him, glaring before his eyes caught the orange ring on Mateo’s wristwatch.

“Nothing you need to worry about, *agent*,” he sneered, emphasising the last word. “But I’m running late for the convoy. The cargo’s water. What do they need to check? Waste of time!” He spat at the ground.

Mateo kept his tone stable. “Everyone’s on a schedule, buddy. Let’s just get through the check. The convoy won’t leave without you.”

“I ain’t your buddy! My boss cleared this already! Fucking Division!” growled the driver.

Kahler stepped forward. “Hey, cool it!”

The trucker spun on him, shoving the corporal back. “Fuck you!”

That was enough. Kahler recovered fast, pulling zip ties from his belt. He and Mateo moved to restrain the man as the tussle drew nearby JTF guards closer.

Soo looked up from her tent, saw the commotion, and jogged toward them.

While Mateo held the suspect, a JTF trooper pulled the rear door open and climbed up. The cargo bay was filled with water barrels, just as the driver had claimed.

“Barrels,” she called. “Says water.”

She pried one open with her knife and shined a flash light on the contents.

It wasn’t water. Blocks of a dense, chemical-smelling pale grey compound sat sweating slightly in the dim light from her torch.

“Corporal?” she said uneasily. “This looks like…”



**BOOM.**

The world went white. The truck was vapourised from the inside out.

The shockwave tore across the checkpoint, blowing out the windows of the command post. Captain White hit the floor as glass and splinters shredded the air. For a few seconds, the only sound was the high-pitched ringing in his ears.

Then came the screams.

He rose shakily, dazed, grabbing his sidearm by reflex. Through the haze of dust, fire licked at the twisted wreckage of the truck, metal peeled open like a flower. Bodies lay scattered across the asphalt.

“Report!” he shouted, grabbing a passing sergeant.

The man’s face was gray with shock. “Argument with a driver, sir. Then the truck… just went up!”

White shoved him toward the radio station. “Get me the base! Now!”

He pushed through the debris. The acrid stench of burning fuel mixed with blood and melted asphalt. A shattered Division watch blinked faintly in the dirt, its orange ring pulsing weakly.

His throat tightened. “Cruz!”

No answer.

He turned toward the medical tents - half-collapsed, canvas torn and smoldering. Civilians cowered behind overturned tables. Something caught his eye - another Division watch, intact this time, attached to an arm beneath a tangle of canvas. He dropped to his knees, pulling the shredded tent aside.

“Agent Park! Soo!”

She was unconscious, pale beneath the dust but breathing. Relief hit him like a second shockwave. He started CPR automatically as the surviving medics rushed to take over.

Around him, the remains of Checkpoint Sycamore burned, smoke curling into the gray Carolina sky as the first drops of rain began to fall.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

The Jaca Jolt one has been my go-to because it gives a quick boost without that heavy acidic feeling coffee sometimes leaves. It’s tiny, easy to toss in my bag, and the mix of caffeine + B12 feels cleaner than chugging another cup of coffee.

The Light Phone was amazing for breaking a lot of the bad habits I'd developed.  Namely the twitches you get when doing nothing or in 2-3 seconds of boredom.

Unfortunately I ended up back in the smartphone world.  The biggest deal breaker was just texting capability.  Was really hard to talk to my wife when I was out with my kids to tell her we needed something.  Doubly true in the car.  The texting even with voice to text on Light Phone 2 is bad.  I frequently just sent garbled stuff so I could retry the voice or typing.

The lack of camera for kid photos was also annoying, but mitigated by occasionally carrying a camera.

My breaking point was I ended up needing Signal to chat with my friends.  Most of my circle that I regularly speak with are all on Signal.  Signal requires a connection to an iPhone or Android to work.  It works for a while if you don't open it, six months apparently, and it finally unlinked my desktop computer.

I’m 25M, small-town guy, tanned, 5’7, always the “dark one” in group photos. Worked hard since 15 — coding, college, first job at 22, WFH, helping family.

Recently moved to Bangalore after switching jobs — 40 LPA. And… wow. This city feels like a different world.

Everyone’s well dressed, into brunch, cafes, couples everywhere, talking about sushi, coffee, concerts… meanwhile I’m still a dal-roti-chai guy with no interest in movies or trending stuff.

Went to the gym, got my body fat checked: 33%. Worked 8 months → down to 24%, lost 10 kg, better clothes, acne somewhat fixed… still feel insecure.

For the first time I thought: “Maybe I want a partner.”
Then reality hit: “Who would like a guy like me? My interests don’t match, everyone’s already paired, I feel behind.”

I don’t hate the city — it’s amazing. But I feel small, like I don’t fully belong.

Anyone else moved from a small town to a big city and felt this weird mix of proud and invisible? How do you deal with it?

I am in the odd position of being very close to finishing therapy with my current psych- not because I want to, but because I only get limited sessions though the organisation, and I am very close to running out. 

I ADORE my psych. It’s taken me 13 therapists over 14 years to find someone I really like and gel with well- I am devastated to have to cease therapy. 

I am hoping to get her a small, but very meaningful gift for when I do finish- she has made such a huge impact in my life over the last few months, and has quite literally been the only reason I didn’t end my life on multiple occasions. 

I’m trying to figure out what would be a good gift tho. I want something small and practical. 

I originally considered a nice pen, but I’ve never seen her write a single thing. Likewise, I’ve considered a coffee cup (but never seen her use one). 

What are some small, appropriate gifts ideas that I could consider? 

She is a relatively new psych from what I can tell- she only finished her masters 2 years ago. I think I’d really like to tap into something self care related, but trying to avoid scents because I don’t know what scents she likes. 

I will definitely give her a card regardless, but I’d like to give her a small Thankyou gift with it when the time comes

My friend said I’m looking for items but everything is unavailable and the employee said it’s been sold out for weeks it should’ve been on the website. He in no way was yelling or aggressive he had his hands crossed do to the tight space( in my culture men and women need to have big spaces between them and yes it tight but you can fit two ppl between them) she started to yell the item is not available or something to the like i wasn’t paying attention I tried to give more space when the first employee left my friend said why are you so aggressive and yelling the girl gave us the information we were leaving but your yelling for no reason( two persons had thier phones out taking videos and she just started shouting more he just left without saying anything. I was trying to explain that I understood you thought he was yelling but the girl couldn’t hear him cuz of the noise and I worked as retailer before you… I know I shouldn’t have said anything. she shouted wow you work as retailer IM A MANAGER. I said im a department head now … I shout up cuz why am I arguing with her she was obviously crashing out had a rough day. Here where I need your advice after I left I found my friend and his daughter at a cafe we had coffee when we tried to pay I couldn’t find my phone. I remember last thing when I was at the store it’s been 45 or so minutes I thought I might not find her. ( In my country nothing is stollen you can literally leave keys to a Ferrari keys at table to safe the table no one will take it and if someone tried everybody will stop them). First thing happened when I came to store that was empty she said her comes the retailer. I said I forgot my phone have you seen it. She said no I said has anyone found it or anything it has a picture on the back of my kid. She said no please leave (with attitude obviously angry) I swear if I had any luck in life it showed all in that moment cuz I was thinking of what to do I’m sure I had it last when we were here my medication alarm went off I think my luck for 5 years has ended at that moment and it rang in her pocket I said that mine and she just took it out and said how do I know it yours (my face was literally the background and my kids) I said my face is one I said don’t give it to me I’ll call the police and they can come and check then she gave it to me I’m fuming at this point I said I can the company and ask for the footage and still press charges don’t do something this stupid again you’d loose this job. She said do your best but in my language which is extremely offensive. Here is the thing I know for a fact if I report her to the company she will 💯be fired I’ve worked with them before they take extreme measures to make sure customer satisfaction is perfect they have extreme control over employees appearance they way they talk everything they sell the experience rather then the product as they should for ornament that cost 150$. Again I think the manger was having a bad day and she thought two more rich entitled individuals. Which I’m 💯 not rich my friend is.

TLDR: misunderstanding in a store mangers yells I forget my phone and she tries to hide it then when caught she said something offensive to be should I report her.",4,1764935637.0,AITAH,7,0.83,False

time I get a cool gift idea. On a separate tab I have listed all gifts I've ever given and I
rate em based on the receiver's response. I know this sounds really obsessive but i just
love gifts so much cant do anything lol.

Anyways, my mothers birthday is in a month so ive already set out on mission perfect
gift (haven't finalized yet) but assuming people come here looking for ideas, I'm hoping
this helps. Keeping this mom and grandma coded.
(will make one for dads too next dw, just keep on a lookout)
1. Nixplay digital picture frame (10.1”) 9/10
If your mom’s the sentimental type. Preload it with old family photos, little videos or a
couple of notes. She won't even have to set it up, just plug it in and it starts playing.
* Touchscreen, rotates automatically, and you can upload pics via app/email
* You can keep adding stuff remotely, which is a low effort way to keep the gift
alive throughout the year
* She'll like it enough to just casually ask “have you sent anything new?”, trust me
* Tip: take just candids and upload, moms love that


2. [Foot Massager (bob and brads
good)](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO467) 8.5/10
For moms who work a lot or have got orthopedic issues. No mom is gonna ask for this
directly but will love it if gifted. Also lowkey everyone in the family gets to use it then,
good investment imo.
* feels like a real massage, like the vibrations go tissue deep, not just the buzz-y
kind
* Comes with heat settings and a remote
* Not that expensive compared to others with similar specs


3. [Personalized bamboo tea
box](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO468) 7.5/10
If you've got an almond mom lol or if she's just green tea obsessed. Honestly you could
replace this with whatever she likes in specific(coffee etc), this one just looked cute to
me.
* You can customize the front with her name or a little message
* Looks super cute on the kitchen counter
* It’s out of stock sometimes, but worth checking around mother’s day or holidays

Meanwhile in India, Turkey, Brazil and Dubai quick commerce is eating everything. Zepto is on a $2B+ run rate, Getir is in hundreds of cities everyone’s fighting for 10 to 15 min delivery like it’s 2021 all over again.
But here? Crickets. Most US founders still act like the category died with Gorillas and the 2022 bloodbath.

I don’t get it, because everything that killed the first wave is basically fixed now:

•	People happily pay $6 to 10 to not leave the couch
•	Baskets are $50 to 80 in big cities (not $25 like before)

•	Everyone orders the same 800 SKUs anyway

•	Dark store rents are actually reasonable if you are not dumb about it

•	New players in Brooklyn, Miami, Austin and Chicago are already profitable on every order
If you are an ecommerce founder still shipping stuff in 2–7 days and grinding on Meta ads in 2025… man you are playing last decade’s game.

Quick commerce feels like the biggest wide-open opportunity in US ecommerce right now especially for anyone who already knows inventory, margins and fulfillment.

I’d have my coffee (sugar & milk), and then usually eat nothing until 4 - 8pm. Granted, I’d start drinking beer around noon & chain smoke. 

I’m trying to get ‘right’— I’m attempting antidepressants, and hopefully Adderall, again for the (kinda) first time since highschool (35/F). I did 1 month of Wellbutrin on the babiest-dose possible, since the other time I tried to start my Dr put me straight onto my old dose of 300mg and that just filled me with rage. 

I took 75mg every day for a month, and I was proud I remembered to take it daily. Then I ran out, and I couldn’t bring myself to go to the pharmacy for my refill 🤦🏼‍♀️. That should be fixed now since I’ve got it set up thru Amazon, and they auto-refill and ship to my door lol (and it’s 40% cheaper than CVS!). 

You’re not supposed to drink on Wellbutrin, but I also need to cut back since I’m at the beginning stages of liver-issues. I’m fat, so my Dr just assumed it’s NAFLD. 

I re-re-started Wellbutrin Monday. I have been trying to make myself eat breakfast with my medication. 

Wednesday I made breakfast, and I didn’t even crave beer…  Today I didn’t eat breakfast, but felt hungry— which is very odd for me. I did crave beer, and admittedly drank 1.5 cans. On the 2nd can, I said ‘fk this, I should eat’. I ate, and I didn’t crave beer the rest of the day. 

I have been binge-eating, though, all day. 

Binge-eating isn’t a new thing— I would typically just allot it all to at-night when I finally started eating real food after drinking 6+ beers throughout the day🙄. 

Luckily I make pretty healthy choices when it comes to food. Friends & family were always confused about why I’m so fat with the types of food/meals I eat. 
I’m trying to not worry myself too much, especially when I take into consideration that 6+ beers is 864+ calories… empty calories. 

Today I had 2 avocado/egg toast & 2 breakfast sausage when I finally got myself to eat. Shortly followed by some of yesterday’s leftover dinner of  ground turkey (with liver & heart) / quinoa / sautéed vegetables… followed by prosciutto, then half a veggie tray… then a chicken thigh, then a handful of berries, then some popcorn. I’m currently eating the other half of the 18 oz veggie tray, and have my eyes on 2 hardboiled eggs 😭 

I think the binge-eating is also decreasing my cigarette intake— which is another good thing since my GP referred me to a pulmonologist (but I haven’t gone yet). 

Is this normal? It doesn’t feel normal. 

Do you think it’s placebo effect?

Will my eating even out? Should I even worry about how much I’m eating right now, so long as I’m making healthy choices? 

I DO have access to ‘unhealthy’ / comfort foods, but I haven’t been getting into them so much. ",6,1764934830.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False
1peswej,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1peswej/i_came_up_with_a_new_atrioc_joke/,I came up with a new Atrioc joke,"Hey Atrioc fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the Atrioc community that Atrioc has ""glizzy hands"", supposedly stating that his fingers are made of hot dog wieners. This, of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about Atrioc. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: Atrioc is a ""hitman horse"". The joke here is that it's saying that Atrioc really likes hitman, and in fact, is a ""horse"" for it.

Now, I don't know Atrioc's actual opinions about hitman, but nevertheless, it could be funny to bring it up on stream. We can consider two outcomes of this joke:

1. Atrioc is not a fan of the ""hitman horse"" joke

If Atrioc does not like the joke, he will tell chat statements such as ""no chat I am not a hitman horse"" and ""what does that joke even mean?"". By telling his chat that he doesn't like the joke, the chat will not follow his directions and keep repeating the ""hitman horse"" joke to annoy him, generating more content.

2. Atrioc is a fan of the ""hitman horse"" joke

If Atrioc does like the joke, he will play into the bit, repeatedly calling himself the ""hitman horse"". Chat will also play into the bit, such as like they did with ""coffee cow"".

I believe this joke has a lot of potential. Think of the things we could have by using this joke. We can have a ""HitmanHorse"" emote, leeches can use this joke in their videos, and Ludwig has a new thing to call Atrioc now!

Someone who will nod thoughtfully when I say “I could totally win a fight against a swan”

A fellow overthinker who sends 3 memes in a row instead of saying “hello”

Must appreciate blanket forts, poorly timed jokes, and unsolicited fun facts

Enjoys conversations that start normal and end with “wait… how did we get here?”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

So you made it to December without making a Christmas list and now people are hounding you about what you want, or maybe you never know what to get people and need some ideas. Look no further, this year, [like last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/1h83a24/partypastors_favorite_things/), I have compiled a list of suggestions, mostly of things that I love and use often, but also things that I have heard very good things about. The other mods are gonna make fun of me for this post, but thats because they don't care about you and want to suppress quality Christmas gifts. But we wont let them.

Last year I sorted by cost and each section will be mostly sorted by cost still. However, this year, I'm sorting by section: Old Reliables, Subscriptions, New Things, Books, Electronics, Furniture/Decor, and Stocking Stuffers! There's about 52 items here, so, without further ado, meet the **PartyPastor Christmas List Suggestions**.

# Old Reliables:

Things that I use frequently that are quality made and well loved. They also were all on my list last year. I have a few other things that are new, that are my new reliables that will be under New Things:

* [**Hero Clip**](https://www.amazon.com/HEROCLIP-Carabiner-Small-Stroller-Backpack/dp/B08GQJC8SV/ref=asc_df_B08GQJC8SV/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693647146532&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=227944586291864757&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012509&hvtargid=pla-1018431085640&psc=1&mcid=b0c65831898b39fa9cde36e55ef4b503) \- (**$16**) - After living in Asia, I got use to having to use the bathroom and just holding my backpack. This is a great carabiner that you can keep on your bag and use to hang your bag when youre in a place that doenst have a hook, like Asian bathrooms, or the random starbucks that someone ripped it off. My family keeps one on every backpack we own and its kept my backpack off many bathroom floors now.
* [**Large Travel Tray**](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/travel-tray?variant=41975661527229) **from Tom Bihn** (**$28**) - Does anyone else not always know how to empty their pockets when traveling? I used to empty them into an upside down hat. So now, I use this all the time when I travel. Its my catchall in the hotel, its helpful in the airport so my stuff isnt falling on the ground. 10/10 recommend
* [**Patagonia Dopp Kit**](https://www.patagonia.com/product/black-hole-packing-cube-3-liters/49362.html) \- (**$40**) If you dont have a good Dop Kit for travel, this one is great. Its slim, but spacious, it is water resistant so if you always worry about stuff spilling on the inside, it wont come out into the rest of your stuff.
* [**East Fork Mug**](https://www.eastfork.com/products/east-fork-mug) \- (**$44**)  This is the most amazing mug. If you’re looking for a great ceramic mug for coffee, this thing keeps it hot for a while, feels good on your hand, and is good looking imo. They are out of Asheville so buying something from this actually helps support employees who live there. I use this mug every day. 
* [**Freefly Hoodie**](https://freeflyapparel.com/products/mens-bamboo-lightweight-hoodie-fatigue?srsltid=AfmBOooD54_IoFfvjI0jaKCvqxxx4scEETrdT1EC3Fmrksiz7nTKGKtR) \- (**$68**) - a super lightweight bamboo hoodie for being out in the sun, but its also good for the slightly cool 60-70 degree weather (sorry non-Americans) where you don't actually want a fulllsweatshirt. I actually wore it this morning at the farmers market.
* [**Two pair of Ex Officio Underwear**](https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Standard-Give-N-Go-Boxer-XX-Large/dp/B0BFZWJGYR/ref=asc_df_B0BFZWJGYR/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1578145770270982114&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012509&hvtargid=pla-2281435184578&psc=1&mcid=7cb5eb59799531c7a126f81661adb6f7&hvocijid=1578145770270982114-B0BFZWJGYR-&hvexpln=73) \- (**$37**) great travel underwear, their selling point is that its fairly easy to wash them and [you can pack less underwear while traveling](https://missadventurepants.com/blog/best-travel-underwear).
* [**Proof Pants**](https://huckberry.com/store/proof/category/p/63566-rover-pant-straight) \- (**$100** \+ shipping) - these are awesome, they have a slight stretch to them and yet they’re lighter in weight but not too light. I love them, they feel like denim but I can wear them to church or to travel in. I've worn them in Norwegian sleet and in Moroccan heat and was comfortable in both.
* [**Second Generation Airpods**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Restored-Apple-True-Wireless-Headphones-with-Charging-Case-White-VIPRB-MV7N2AM-A-Refurbished/674022410?conditionGroupCode=2&athcpid=674022410&athpgid=AthenaItempage&athcgid=null&athznid=PWSMT&athieid=v0&athstid=CS020%7ECS098&athguid=zNdsISLNb7OmARoJgugiW2HJ7zlN-WvacS9R&athancid=895592340&athposb=3&athena=true&athbdg=L1103&adsRedirect=true) (**$100**) - These are fairly no nonsense. They still fit like the OG apple headphones but are annoyingly bluetooth since everything is moving that way. If you wanna upgrade to bluetooth but don't want something totally different, this would be good for you.
* [**The Lawnmower 5 Razor**](https://www.manscaped.com/products/lawn-mower-5) (**$109**) - this is (I have the 4 but still) my go to razor for my neck and cleaning up my beard. If you're a dude and are looking for something good for beard (or not beard) clean up, this is it. Also i think its water proof?
* [**Patagonia Black Hole Duffle (55L)**](https://www.patagonia.com/product/black-hole-duffel-bag-55-liters/196924365292.html) \- (**$169**) This is a phenomenal duffel. I got one (the 120L) years ago for my birthday from my parents before I moved to South America for a summer and my bag was being thrown in the back of a truck and being driven around a rainforest (getting rained on). Since then, its been to like 10 other countries and gone through it. This is a smaller size that I recently got and its been a fantastic purchase.

# Subscriptions:

Want a regular subscription and don't wanna pay for it? Here's a few recommendations for subscriptions you could ask for:

* [**One Year Subscription of National Geographic**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/subscribe/topic/natgeo?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=cpc::src=google::cmp=evergreen24::add=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5Bm0t5mRWa5io8NWWcdHNGb-XhxjCn0QeDuH-em00kogc6ENk6mKCsxoCazsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) (**$49**) - this should be obvious what it is but its a fun one.
* [**Enderly Coffee Subscription**](https://www.enderlycoffee.com/product/copy-of-gift-subscription-6-months) (6 months) - (**$84**) - this is my favorite coffee, maybe in all of North America. Their Ethiopia is perhaps the best coffee ever, and so this could make a good gift to ask for.
* [**Atlas Tea Club**](https://atlascoffeeclub.com/products/gift-for-tea-lovers?ref_coupon=lovetea&redirect=tea) (3 months) **- ($50)** \- I don't drink tea but u/terevos2 does and for his sake, I've included a neat tea subscription here.
* [**Proton VPN or Mail Gift Card**](https://shop.proton.me/collections/coming-soon/products/proton-50-gift-card-print-at-home) (**$50**) - Last year u/L-Win-Ransom mocked my list and tbh, he was right, the list needed more VPN sponsorship. So here it is, the best most secure mail and VPN set up is here.
* [**History By Mail**](https://historybymail.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoryTJkDklY4hmO7VuwOtSY9t4sTOzhxemmZmAjmlPvCTIkO9Obc) (6 months) - (**$42)** \- I have not used this but it looks really cool and if I lived somewhere that I could get this, I would likely ask for it if I didn't have anything else to ask for.
* [**Book of the Month Club**](https://www.bookofthemonth.com/gift) (6 months) - (**$99**) - Again, have not used but I hear great things about!

# New Things:

Here's a list of things that either are new to me or things not included here yet that are cool and worth buying!

* [**Cherry Bones Coffee Magazine**](https://shop.cherrybonesmag.com/products/cherry-bones-issue-1) **($26)** \- James Hoffman has a coffee related magazine now. They've only printed one issue so far but I have it on our coffee table right now. Its fantastic and I highly recommend it.
* [**Owala Free Sip Sway**](https://owalalife.com/products/freesip-sway?variant=55750729662623&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22258587330&gbraid=0AAAAACg39oE4VF_i8MpdIKjOGUWAGW_Ao&gclid=CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwL1uuTRSHwDJCrKNVdDbSHKG8GfYWcWccgWPr--3Oy-Qh5mJKq1XjxoCxnYQAvD_BwE) **- ($35)** Last year I recommended the old model of Owala, and I stand by it. But my one major complaint was ""*the loop to hold it doesnt feel the most solid but its never broken*"". They have improved on the old design with this new design and its for the better.
* [**Purist Coffee Mug**](https://www.puristcollective.com/collections/all/products/maker-10oz?variant=32152211456113) (10 oz) - (**$38**) - This is my go-to travel mug. Its fantastic and the way it dispenses (?) the coffee has prevented me from ever being burnt by hot coffee.
* [**Clever Dripper Coffee and filters Set**](https://www.amazon.com/Clever-Coffee-Dripper-Large-Ounces/dp/B00EOM5RN0) **- ($44) -** Last year I recommended the V602, which I stand by and still highly recommend. However a debate arose in the comments between the Clever Dripper folks and the Aeropress folks, and after testing it for a year, the aeropress kinda sucks. So on recommendation from u/cledus_snow last year, here is the clever dripper.
* [**Rummikub Game**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G9VCEU?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (**$56**) This is a fancier version of Rummikub. You can find a cheaper version for about $25 elsewhere. But this is a good game that will look good in your house and make all your kids hate each other.
* [**Sackcloth and Ashes Blanket**](https://sackclothandashes.com/collections/shop-all) (**$140**) - For each blanket you purchase, they give a blanket to your local shelter. These blankets are super high quality and super cozy.
* [**Patagonia R1 Air Fleece Jacket**](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-r1-air-fleece-midlayer-jacket/40275.html?cgid=mens-fleece-jackets) (**$160**) - Patagonia has been making this jacket for a bit now, but only as a pullover or with a hoodie. Finally they've made it with a full zipper and normal collar. I've been using it for flights and it works fantastic, its a great little light jacket.
* **Away Luggage** ([carryon](https://www.awaytravel.com/products/carry-on-olive-green) **$206** \- [checked](https://www.awaytravel.com/products/large-olive-green) **$281**) - We got these. They have a fantastic warranty and they hold most of our immediate needs when traveling!

* [**Every Nation: Seeing God Around the World**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0830790098?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) \- (**$15**) This is a ***kids book*** inspired by a missionary's travels around the world with her kids and how we see God in the world.

1pesstj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1pesstj/30_days_birthday_share/,30 Days- Birthday Share,"I hit 30 days sober on the third. That’s the longest I’ve gone without drinking since I turned 18. I turn 29 later this month. 

I remember the first time I got well and truly drunk. It was after an evening of abuse. I was hollow inside. I drank a bottle of wine and at 40lbs underweight, it hit me like a brick. I had crawled onto my mattress on the floor in the storage room of my abuser’s house. I lit some candles I’d shoplifted from the store nearby. There, I drank the bottle I lifted, too. I wasn’t used to my body feeling good. I wasn’t used to feeling good. I stared at the ceiling while I drifted on a warm, golden, quiet ocean. 
  After that, I used the bottle when I didn’t want to feel so bad anymore. 

I had my heart spectacularly broken two or so years ago. I turned to the bottle. I looked for answers at the bottom. There never were any, but I kept checking, just in case. 

I was deeply betrayed by many friends in a stupid dramatic blowout the likes of which soap operas have never seen. 

So I looked in the bottom of the bottle for any echoes of comfort. The warm, golden, and quiet ocean became harder and harder to travel to. The entry requirements steeper each time I drank. And drank I fucking did. 

I sought work, found some bartending at a dive full of marines and blue collars, the bar rotting on her decades-old bones. The roof leaks, the floor is uneven, and we say the same refrain, muttering it to one another as we grimly shoot whiskey straight and chase it with light beer. “If you’re going to drink yourself to death, you’re going to do it here.” The bartender I replaced died young of liver and kidney failure, only dropping the bottle when his soul left his hands.

I drank. Oh god, I drank. I drank to forget, to remember, to fuck up again, to stop fucking up. I drank like a damn fish who’d been gulping for air on a beach. 

The hangovers. Shaking, vomiting my swollen insides raw, the nerve zaps, mouth like cracked leather, the soppy brain moving like a salted slug in my skull, weakness when I stood like I have never known. The shots at noon, at ten, at eight. The shots every 20 minutes of my shift. The doubles when I got off. The bottle when I got home. 

The warm, golden, quiet ocean had become an arctic, winedark, thrashing sea. I could no longer see past the surface as it pitched me about like a broken doll, and the strange and terrifying creatures below me waiting, circling, never seen but felt in the pit of my gut. They waited for me to grow tired of keeping my head above water. They smelled my despair like chum and came to watch me die. 

I woke up at the bottom of the grave I’d been digging for myself and I made a phone call. Hail Mary, full of grace….

I closed the bar that day without drinking. The effort it took not to raise that glass to my lips made my hands sweat and shake. I stayed in an ihop all night after I clocked off with the friend I called. We drank shitty coffee and they told me about AA-how it really was. I told them about my alcoholism- how it really was. 

Seven Am rolled around and we packed out, and I went to my first meeting. I claimed a 24 hour chip and pressed it so hard into my palm that I wasn’t sure the imprint would ever fade. 

And today, when I stood up in the late meeting in that basement, crammed with people who are nothing like me and just like me at the same time, and I announced myself as an alcoholic, dry for 30 days, it was the first time I’ve felt something real from a room erupting into applause on my behalf.  

And for a moment, I was on the soft shores of a warm, golden, quiet ocean, watching the sun come up. I’ve got another chance. I get one every day, to live. I get a chance to live instead of die. 

That’s worth all the bullshit in the world. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading what I didn’t have the words to say earlier. Thanks for *being* this program. 

Here’s to another 30 days, HP willing.

1pessj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonVGC/comments/1pessj5/want_to_understand_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,want to understand ultimate perfection of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pessb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1pessb3/dealing_with_paranoia/,Dealing with paranoia,"Feeling pretty crappy. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode. I deleted my instagram app because I feel extremely paranoid being on there. I have been isolating myself from my coworkers. I am barely eating. I’ve been surviving on coffee most days, and maybe one meal. I can’t trust people right now. I’m in therapy, which helps.. but I’m afraid of telling them how I really feel. We’re working through some pretty intense trauma right now, and it’s been heavily impacting my mood. I had to take medical leave because I was feeling overwhelmed almost everyday. 

I feel like inpatient would be a good idea, but I can’t do that. My therapist thinks that all of this is just burnout. Maybe it is, but I cannot help but think everyone hates me. I feel like I’m being treated differently. It’s awful. It would be embarrassing going to inpatient literally a year after my first visit. I can’t even go to the same place, since my insurance changed. It was really nice to be honest. I’m paying for my own insurance, and my deductible is high. I wouldn’t be able to afford it.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I feel like I’m slipping away slowly. I can’t talk to anyone else about it. I hate it.",4,1764934427.0,Psychosis,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Remember that on the show?,"Was a big deal on the show around that time. The debate over that title even. Around then I didn’t have access to the radio show daily. I lived 2.5 hours upstate. But watched the E shows every day. 

On an Art trip as a senior in high school to NYC we had time to wonder the city alone for a while. Which seems a little crazy to be honest. Walking by a store window I see the most stunning woman I had ever seen in person. She had on the smallest dress ever. I mean literally must’ve been an inch below her hips. My two buddies kept walking and I said wait to them. I told them I recognized her. 

Then a big guy comes out the front door of the cyber cafe and I thought he was going to tell us to go away. We weren’t there long. But it was the opposite. He basically begged us to come inside. There were more press than fans. Multiple news cameras and reporters. He said we could have free coffee and food. So we said sure. Sat down and then they were making it out like we were her die hard fans. 

First they said come meet her. My two friends pushed me forward even though woman that stunning are intimidating to me. So I stupidly just said “so you’re the queen of the internet?” She sweetly said “that’s what they tell me”. Little did I know at the time how controversial the whole thing was and why she probably gave that answer. 

Then some photographers wanted us to get in for some pictures. I stood next to her and they kept saying get closer and then told me to put my arm around her waste. Which felt amazing. I mean that dress she had on woman don’t normally wear in public. She was half naked practically. She signed some magazine that came out with her on it. Then one of the news cameras interviewed me. I froze a little and didn’t know what to really say. They asked what I liked about her and I just said she’s really down to earth and nice. They just kinda shoved the camera in my face with bright lights all of a sudden and a mic right above me. 

I’ve always tried wondered if any of that footage was used for any news segments or photos for any of the papers. Even googling the event I can’t find any photos and just find basic info it happened. I still have the magazine somewhere. I mean she had one of the sexiest double episodes on the E show with her super hot friend putting water on each other. 

This deep dive today into this day I met her was because it happened spring 1999 which was also when the infamous Dana Plato interview and death happened. That was early May. This was sometime right around there. Just not sure when. I thought I saw something that maybe that event happened in March. If anyone has better Google skills than me and can find photos from that event I would be so thankful. If anyone read this far ",1,1764934166.0,howardstern,4,0.67,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl ( cue the song ) and I’m looking to make a friend , someone to text about everything , nothing and all the dumbassery in-between . 

 Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click : 
I’m 21 years old. I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking ,crafting , long walks in nature.

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. 

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Does that sound pretty cool to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyways ;))

I have a few interests, mainly video games!

But honestly i love to play a whole bunch of stuff. Please I can yap about it for hours sheesh.

I am also into tech, I love tinkering and just looking at new stuff coming out. I usually don't BUY a lot of tech but bleeding edge stuff is never cheap 🤣, ill give it a couple years. But old stuff is really what im into, i love just seeing what communites do with older consoles and the advancements made to preserve and modernize a lot of these systems! I could talk about Bad Update for hours its such cool stuff honestly 😁.

I'm also into Cooking, Ive been dabbling in baking but its so much harder than i thought!

# 📖 **Craig, According to Scripture**

### *Chapter the First*

1. And it came to pass in the hush of a narrow room, lit only by a lamp of amber hue, that Craig did sit before a table worn smooth by many hands.

2. There was no incense, nor crystal array, nor symbols to warn the unlearned. Only a cloth of faded blue, a chair that creaked when the body shifted, and a deck of cards, humble and oft-handled.

3. And Craig was not as the prophets of old, whose voices thundered in the streets; neither was he as the flamboyant diviners, who clothed themselves in spectacle. For Craig was quiet, and the quiet was upon him.

4. He took up the cards, and they were cool in his hands, as though they had known colder places.

5. And he said within himself, *I will draw but one, and then I shall be finished, for I grow weary of knowing things before they arrive.*

6. So he drew a card and turned it over.

7. And behold, it was not The Tower, nor Death, nor The Lovers, but a smaller truth: **The Hanged Man**.

8. And Craig frowned, not in fear, but in familiarity. For this card had found him often, like a stranger who knew his name.

9. And he whispered, *Again thou comest, though I called thee not.*

10. And the card, though it had no voice, spake unto him: *There is one who is not yet moving, yet in his stillness he gathereth the current. He is as a fish near the back of the waters, yet he shall know the way of the many.*

11. And Craig knew not this man’s name, nor his dwelling, nor the sound of his voice. Only that the cord of fate had brushed him, briefly, and departed.

12. And this troubled Craig more than visions of fire or storm, for mystery without image is the heaviest burden to bear.

13. And he set the card aside, saying: *Blessed are they whose futures shout aloud…but woe to those who move in perfect silence, for they are carried by unseen tides.*

14. And he drew again, once more against his better knowing.

15. And behold, it was **The Three of Cups**, and the image of many gathered together in song and gladness was set before him.

16. And Craig’s breath caught, and he saw not faces, but motion. Not voices, but rhythm. Not people, but a *school* of them, moving in strange, beautiful unison.

17. And he knew then that the first vision and the second were bound as one.

18. And he covered the cards with trembling hands, and said:
    *There shall come a man who beginneth at the back, and endeth at the front. He shall first be led, and then he shall lead. And music shall follow him, as water followeth the moon.*

19. Yet he knew not that the man’s name was Ted.

20. Thus was Craig awakened to a truth that had not yet learned his name.

21. And this was the beginning of his burden.

---  

### *Chapter the Second*

1. And it came to pass, after the first revealing, that Craig resolved within his heart: *I shall no longer seek the unseen. I shall know only what standeth plainly before me.*

2. So he placed the cards into a drawer, and shut it, and rested a book upon that drawer, and a cup upon the book, and a second book upon the cup — that no temptation might breathe upon him.

3. And he sat in stillness, and turned his mind unto common things: the cracking of the walls, the ticking of the clock, the small procession of dust through the light.

4. And peace, for a little while, did come upon him.

5. Yet even as he sought ordinary thought, a vision crept in unbidden, as mist beneath a door.

6. He beheld not a king upon a throne, nor a city in flames, nor a prophet upon a hill.

7. He beheld a man of unremarkable build, standing within a kitchen of modest arrangement.

8. Before the man was a cup of coffee, steaming gently, as though it had been blessed.

9. And the man did lift the cup in confidence… and the sleeve of his garment did trail behind it… and the dark liquid came upon his wrist, yea, even unto his forearm.

10. And the man spoke aloud, not in cursing nor in prayer, but in mild surprise, saying:
    *Ow.*

11. And he sought a towel, which was not where he had last placed it.

12. And he found instead a napkin of insufficient strength, and this he pressed bravely to the spill.

13. And the napkin did surrender and dissolve, and the coffee passed through it as a thought passeth through a dream.

14. And still the man remained calm, as a lake upon which a leaf falleth.

15. Then the vision deepened further, and Craig beheld the same man looking for keys that were in his hand, and spectacles that were upon his brow.

16. And the man chuckled unto himself, softly, and the sound of it was not bitter.

17. And a knowing entered Craig, gentle but firm, saying:
    *This small inconvenience is appointed. It shall come to pass before the sun hath climbed its second measure.*

18. And Craig trembled, not at the greatness of the vision, but at its simplicity.

19. And he whispered: *Surely I have mistaken the message — for such a thing needeth no prophet.*

20. Yet even as he spoke, certainty remained.

21. And Craig bowed his head, and said not a curse, nor a blessing, but a vow:
    *If I am to see, then I shall see. If I am to keep it, then I shall carry it in silence.*

22. And the vision departed, leaving behind it only the stillness… and the faintest echo of the word.

23. And Craig understood that his charge was not to foretell the extraordinary alone, but the unseen holiness of ordinary moments.

24. And he knew also that the man in the vision was the same whose path moved from the back of the waters toward the front.

25. Though still he knew not his name.

26. And thus the second chapter of Craig was recorded.

---  

### *Chapter the Third*

Craig had made a habit of being careful with his eyes.

Not in the physical sense—his eyesight was fine—but in the way a man might become cautious about where he *aimed* his awareness. He avoided reflective surfaces on bad days. He refused to sit with his back to windows in restaurants. He tried not to stare at hands unless absolutely required. Lines in the palm were just lines in the palm. Smudges of lipstick on a mug were just smudges. Coffee grounds were… just something to rinse down the drain.

He had not touched his tarot deck in six months and two weeks. The cards sat wrapped in a dish towel in the back of a kitchen drawer, beneath a nest of rubber bands, a half-charged vape, and a takeout menu from a Chinese place that had closed in 2011.

This was all very intentional.

So when the vision came, it caught him mid-chew of a bagel.

It was embarrassingly unimpressive.

Not fire. Not ruin. Not love. Not death.

Just… a man. At a café counter. Slightly distracted. Reaching for a coffee that wasn’t entirely where he believed it to be.

A tiny, absurd miscalculation.

A tremble of liquid over the rim.
A soft brown betrayal across white tile.

That was it.

Craig blinked. The bagel fell from his fingers, cream cheese side down, but the universe had already used its one dramatic flourish for the morning.

“Seriously?” he muttered to the empty kitchen. “That’s what you break a six month truce for?”

And like all useless visions, it came with a tag attached — an awareness. A responsibility. Not to fix it. Not to prevent it. Just… to **bear witness** to it. Like a cosmic intern clocking in for a shift nobody acknowledged.

He cursed under his breath and the image dissolved instantly. Gone. Closed.

The responsibility fulfilled by resentment alone.

Except… an hour later, at a café two blocks away, Craig happened to choose a table he didn’t normally sit at.

Except… he happened to look up at the exact moment the bell over the door chimed.

And there was Ted.

Same vague posture Craig had seen in the flash. Same distracted touch to the side of his temple like he was trying to recall something that lived just out of reach.

Ted approached the counter. Smiled at the barista. Checked his phone. Reached.

The cup wobbled.

A small crescendo of inevitability.

Coffee bloomed over the side and scattered in a thin, tragic puddle across tile.

No one gasped. No one screamed. A napkin was produced. A manager gestured kindly. A new cup was made. Life went on.

But Craig felt the truth of it land like thunder inside him.

It had been real.

And it had been about *Ted.*

Not great Ted-things. Not terrible Ted-things. Just… Ted-things.

He watched Ted apologize too much. Watch him laugh at himself softly, like this wasn’t the first time gravity had personally singled him out.

There was something holy in the smallness of it.

And something terrifying.

Craig sat back, heart ticking with a new type of awareness.

“If that’s the scale now,” he murmured, “the divine has officially run out of flair.”

Yet…

The fact remained.

The Sight had returned.
The prophecy had activated.
And Ted had spilled the coffee precisely on schedule.

Which meant — unfortunately — whether Craig wanted it or not…

He was “back.” 

---

## **Chapter 4 – The Gift, Spurned**

Craig began to avoid the future by avoiding everything.

He didn’t walk past mirrored buildings anymore. He unsubscribed from every newsletter that opened with “Your Week Ahead.” He blocked three astrology accounts on social media out of pure, petty spite. Even the weather app started to feel suspicious.

But the true rebellion was simpler than that.

He stopped *listening.*

Not listening to the hints, the vibrations, the strange intuition that had once felt like a second nervous system. He ignored the tug to look up just before a moment happened. He refused to sit inside the stillness where visions liked to form.

He filled every silence with noise.

Podcasts. Traffic. Static. Music with too many lyrics. He ate with the TV on. He slept with someone else’s voice in his ear. He treated quiet like it was a predatory animal.

And the Sight… grew tired.

It did not punish him.  
It did not bargain.  
It did not threaten.

It simply began to *leave.*

At first it felt like peace.

No more flashes. No more strange little downloads from the unseen. The world returned to normal speed, normal colour, normal confusion. Craig found he could look at a stranger’s hands and see only hands. A coffee cup was a coffee cup. A cloud was a cloud.

For a moment, he smiled at nothing.

“Finally,” he said out loud, and meant: *I am mine again.*

But slowly, a dullness crept in that was harder to name.

He stopped noticing patterns.  
He stopped feeling the charge in certain rooms.  
He stopped dreaming in symbols.

He wasn’t just cut off from prophecy.

He was cut off from *depth.*

Conversations grew flatter. Jokes didn't land the same. Coincidences lost their poetry and became just… things that happened.

He passed Ted on the sidewalk one afternoon and felt absolutely nothing.

Not recognition.  
Not echo.  
Not a tremor of fate.

Just a man going the opposite direction.

That’s when he knew.

The gift had not only departed.

It had **closed the door behind it.**

That night, he opened the kitchen drawer for the first time in months. The deck was still wrapped in the same old dish towel. He unrolled it carefully, like he might wake something sleeping.

The cards no longer felt warm.  
They felt like paper.  
Inert. Flat. Ordinary.

He shuffled.

Nothing stirred.

He drew one card anyway.

The image meant nothing to him now.

And that — more than visions, more than prophecy, more than power — was the true cost.

Not that he could no longer see the future…

But that the world had stopped whispering back.

Craig stared at the table for a long while and whispered, to no one at all,

“…Oh.”

She called me up last month, absolutely panicked. Just bought a 4BHK in DLF, probably cost her close to 4 crores, and she’s standing in this blank space crying because she has no idea what to do with it. Her words were literally “I feel like I’ve made a huge mistake.” She didn’t make a mistake though. What she needed was a luxury interior designer in DLF Gurgaon who actually knew their way around these properties and genuinely gave a shit about making her feel at home instead of just impressing her with some trendy design nonsense. That’s where I came in. That’s what being a real[ **luxury interior designer in DLF Gurgaon**](https://urbanscope.in/) is about.

That’s what got me into this business honestly. It wasn’t because I dreamed of being an interior designer since I was five. It was because I saw my parents buy this beautiful house and hire someone who basically turned it into a showroom. My mom hated it. She felt uncomfortable in her own home. So I dragged my dad to fire the designer and I said “let me try.” I was maybe 25, completely clueless, but I listened to what my mom actually wanted instead of what I thought looked cool. And you know what? It turned out amazing. My parents still live in that house thirty years later and they still tell people their son designed it.

That’s when I realized – this isn’t about being a designer. It’s about being a listener and someone who genuinely cares about how people live in their spaces.

# Understanding Luxury Interior Design in DLF Gurgaon

# What Makes Luxury Interior Design Different

Alright so here’s what pisses me off – people throw the word “luxury” around like it means something. You see these Instagram accounts with all these pristine, perfect rooms that nobody actually lives in. They’re like museums. Nobody’s watching TV in those spaces, nobody’s eating dinner there, nobody’s having a bad day and just collapsing on the couch with a glass of wine.

Real luxury? That’s completely different. That’s walking into a space and feeling like you can breathe. That’s sitting on your sofa and thinking “this is exactly where I want to be right now.” That’s your friends coming over and feeling welcome and comfortable instead of like they’re in some fancy hotel lobby where they can’t touch anything.

I had this meeting last year with a couple, right? Super wealthy, they could buy whatever they wanted. And the husband told me something that stuck with me. He said “I don’t want to feel like I’m living in a catalog.” That hit me because that’s what happens when designers prioritize looking good over feeling good.

When I start working with someone, I’m asking all kinds of weird questions that probably don’t sound like designer questions. I want to know – do you have kids? How old? What do they do? Are they messy? Do you have pets? What’s your work like? Are you stressed or relaxed when you come home? Do you cook? What’s your biggest complaint about your current space? What time do you wake up? Do you like natural light or do you hate it? What’s something that makes you genuinely happy?

These questions sound random but they’re everything. I had a client tell me she had chronic migraines and certain kinds of artificial light made them worse. So suddenly the whole lighting plan changed. We’re not putting in standard ceiling lights, we’re looking at specific types of LEDs that don’t trigger migraines, we’re maximizing natural light, we’re avoiding fluorescent anything. That’s luxury – creating a space that actually works for your body and your life.

I had another client who was a night owl and his wife was an early bird. They were fighting about bedroom lighting constantly. So we installed these individual lighting systems – she can have bright morning light to wake up, he can have complete darkness. Sounds simple but that one thing probably saved their marriage, honestly. They both said as much.

# Why DLF Gurgaon Demands Specialized Design Expertise

Listen, I love DLF Gurgaon. I’ve designed probably over a hundred apartments here. But it’s not like designing in a regular residential area. These are completely different animals.

First of all, the people living here are not average. They’re business owners, they’re CEOs, they’re doctors, they’re artists who’ve made it big. They’ve got taste, they’ve got standards, and they’re not going to accept mediocre work. One client I worked with was a woman who ran a fashion brand. She had very specific ideas about aesthetics and she knew good design when she saw it. She’d also lived in Paris, Milan, New York. She wasn’t going to be impressed by something that looked good in a magazine if it didn’t actually work.

The buildings themselves are tricky. DLF has these massive windows in some apartments which is amazing – incredible natural light. But that light is also intense. In summer, some apartments get blasted with heat starting at 1 PM. You need to know how to manage that. You need the right window treatments, the right colors, the right materials. I once had an apartment where the afternoon sun was so intense that the client couldn’t use her living room after 2 PM without the AC working overtime. We solved it by installing these smart films on the windows that rejected heat, we chose lighter colors on the walls to reflect more light, we used specific types of upholstery that don’t absorb heat. Suddenly she could use her living room comfortably in the afternoon.

Then there’s the open-plan layout thing. Most DLF apartments are designed with massive open living-dining-kitchen areas. Which is beautiful but also challenging. How do you create distinct spaces without putting up walls? How do you make the dining area feel like a dining area and the living area feel like a living area when they’re technically the same room? I’ve had to get creative with flooring changes, ceiling details, strategic furniture placement, lighting design that defines spaces.

I worked with one family who were terrified about the open plan because they have teenage kids and they wanted the kitchen to feel separate so they could cook without feeling like they were performing for the kids in the living room. We created this subtle visual separation using a custom bookcase that wasn’t a full wall but was substantial enough to define the spaces. They could still see into the living area, still hear what the kids were doing, but suddenly cooking felt private. They were so happy.

One more thing about DLF – these people have specific lifestyles. I’ve designed apartments for a guy who’s a serious wine collector, and we had to create a temperature-controlled wine room. I’ve designed for a woman who’s an artist and needs specific lighting and wall space for her work. I’ve designed for a family with three kids under 8 who needed durability and smart storage without sacrificing elegance. Each situation is completely unique and requires someone who actually understands luxury residential design, not just someone who can make things look pretty.

# The Luxury Interior Design Process

# Initial Consultation and Understanding Your Vision

So I’ve been doing this long enough that I can tell you – the first meeting is everything. I spend anywhere from 2 to 4 hours with a client initially, and we’re not in my office with mood boards. We’re in their apartment, in their space, actually talking.

I’m observing everything. How do they move through the space? Where do they naturally sit? Are they comfortable or are they perching on the edge of furniture? Do they spend time by the window or do they avoid it? Are their walls bare or covered with art? Do they have lots of books or hardly any? Are there family photos everywhere or none? Are there plants? Is there a collection of something – art, vintage cameras, wine bottles, whatever?

I’m also asking questions that might seem totally unrelated to design. “What’s a typical day like for you?” “What time do you get home?” “What’s the first thing you do when you walk through your door?” “What would be your ideal evening?” “Where do you feel most relaxed – have you stayed somewhere that felt perfect?” “What’s one thing about your current space that drives you crazy?” “What’s something you absolutely never want to see in your home?”

I had this meeting with a guy who mentioned offhand that he works from home and takes meetings on Zoom. Suddenly I’m thinking about his background – does he want it to look professional? Does he want it hidden? Does he have clients from around the world who might see Indian architecture? That one comment changed how I approached the entire space.

I’m also not shy about pushing back. If someone says they want something that I think won’t work, I tell them straight up. I had a client who wanted to paint her small bedroom a deep burgundy because she loved the color. Now, normally a small dark room gets smaller and darker with that color. So I explained that to her, I showed her examples, I talked about how it would feel in the space. And you know what? Instead of getting mad, she appreciated the honesty. We ended up doing a compromise – we painted one feature wall in burgundy and the rest in a lighter complementary color. Her bedroom turned out absolutely stunning, and she loved it because it felt like exactly what she wanted but executed in a way that actually worked.

I also spend time just sitting in the space. I’ll sit in the living room and imagine furniture arrangements. I’ll stand where the kitchen is and imagine cooking there. I’ll lie on the bed and look at the ceiling. I’m getting a feel for the space and trying to understand how the client experiences it.

# Space Planning and Layout Optimization

This is where I basically become obsessive. I’ve spent entire days in a client’s apartment, just walking around at different times, observing.

I want to understand the natural flow. When someone comes home, which direction do they naturally walk? Do they go to the kitchen first, the bathroom, the bedroom? How do they move through the space when they’re relaxed versus when they’re entertaining guests? Where do people naturally congregate when there are people over? Which corner gets ignored?

I had this one open-plan apartment where the client’s family wasn’t using the dining area at all. Everyone kept ending up in the kitchen. I asked why and she said it just felt natural. So instead of fighting that, we redesigned the space to embrace it. We made the kitchen the main gathering area, we put a large island with seating, we created a casual dining situation rather than a formal dining room. Now the family actually uses that space and loves it. If I’d just designed a formal dining room because that’s what most open plans have, it would have been wasted space.

I’m also thinking about flexibility. Is the space going to change? Are kids going to grow up? Will someone start working from home? Will they move their exercise equipment in? Good design shouldn’t be so rigid that you can’t adapt to changes in your life.

I spent hours in this one apartment figuring out how to make a home office that didn’t scream “office.” The client worked in finance and did client calls from home, so he needed it to look professional. But he also didn’t want his home to feel like a corporate space. We created this really nice office nook in one corner of the master bedroom using custom furniture that looked beautiful but also closed up at night so it wasn’t visible. He could do his Zoom calls during the day and the space looked like home in the evenings. Perfect solution.",1,1764933119.0,u_Altruistic-Cut8826,0,1.0,False

3. **Sweep on BB powder**  

That’s it. No layers. No blending. No stress.

For students who run to 8 AM classes or professionals balancing morning chaos with Zoom meetings, BB powder is a reliable shortcut that still keeps you presentable.

# Why It’s Great for Busy People

* Takes **less than 30 seconds** to apply  
* Minimizes **dullness, dark spots, or uneven tones**  
* Helps you start the day looking awake even if you don’t feel it  

Think of BB powder as your morning confidence booster small product, big difference.

# Your Commute Companion: Stay Fresh on the Move 

Let’s be honest commutes are not glamorous. Whether you’re squeezing into a bus, walking under the sun, or sitting in traffic, your skin goes through a lot. Sweat, dust, and humidity can easily dull your look.

That’s where having the **best face powder** in your bag becomes a lifesaver.

# Portable & Practical

BB powders usually come in compact form with a mirror easy to use anytime, anywhere. A quick dab can:

* absorb excess oil  
* remove shine  
* refresh your look  

Perfect for students moving between classes or professionals running between client meetings.

# No-Makeup Makeup Look

On the go, you don’t want something messy or bold. BB powder gives:

* a soft matte finish  
* natural coverage  
* a clean, fresh appearance  

If minimalism is your style, a compact BB powder is enough to keep you looking polished all day.

# Midday Shine? BB Powder Handles It Without Looking Heavy 

Around noon, oil begins to peek through especially for those with combination or oily skin. Instead of using tissue that disturbs your makeup or applying thick layers of product, BB powder gives a smooth touch-up.

# Reasons It Excels at Midday Touch Ups

* **Doesn’t cake**, no matter how many times you reapply  
* **Blends seamlessly**, even over sunscreen  
* **Controls shine** without altering your natural skin tone  

A quick dab on the T-zone nose, forehead, chin and you’re good to go. You stay fresh without looking like you tried too hard.

# What Makes a Powder the Best Face Powder for Daily Use?

When choosing your ideal daily-use powder, keep these factors in mind:

# 1. Lightweight Formula

Daily powders must feel breathable, not sticky or heavy. Look for finely milled textures.

# 2. Oil Control

If your skin gets shiny quickly, choose a powder with sebum-control technology.

# 3. Skin-Friendly Ingredients

Hypoallergenic, dermatologically tested, and enriched with vitamins or minerals are ideal for everyday use.

# 4. Shade Matching

Opt for natural shades close to your skin tone to avoid a white cast or patchy look.

# 5. Buildable Coverage

You should be able to wear it lightly in the morning and layer during touch-ups.

# Who Should Use BB Powder?

BB powder works great for:

* **Beginners** who want simple makeup  
* **Students** who need quick fixes  
* **Working professionals** who prefer low-maintenance grooming  
* **E-commerce sellers** looking to understand product benefits  

**Small business owners** who want relatable content for their audience",1,1764933095.0,u_Extension-Humor6823,0,1.0,False

""It's a great movie, but honestly, the thing that keeps me from wanting to go back and watch it again is always that scene with Tarantino near the end. I don't personally find his acting very appealing. I know that's mean to say, I just can't help it..."" 

Evans continued, ""... and then there's the part where he starts ranting about how good his coffee is, which for some reason, requires him to repeatedly use the 'N word.' It just makes me uncomfortable and really takes me out of the movie every time. That's just me though, I don't think he should stop acting in his films, and they are HIS films, after all. It's ultimately his decision. I would always rather see a flawed movie with a vision over a soulless corporate product made by committees of people who only want to design something to make money. That's just my opinion though. I wish him well and look forward to seeing his new projects in the future. God bless us all, and happy holidays, everyone!""

Mr. Evans' comments have sparked a backlash of anger from many corners of the internet. Droves of movie fans and foot enthusiasts alike have been speaking up in defense of Tarantino. Many fans have also praised the ""bravery"" of Tarantino to continue to cast himself in roles where he says the ""N word"" well into the 21st century. 

Actor Robert Downey Jr. in a GQ interview recently had this to say: ""It's no secret I've been a fan of Mr. Evans' work for years. I've said on multiple occasions that Space Cop is my favorite movie, and the breathtaking performance of Rich Evans in that role was a big inspiration for how I played Tony Stark, the Iron Man, in the Marvel movie Iron Man, where I played Tony Stark, the Iron Man. But, I just gotta say, Rich, buddy, you missed the mark on this one. Why you would go on the attack against Mr. Tartnino like that, I can't imagine. Get better, buddy. I love you.""

Right from the beginning, I should've known I was seeing things through rose-tinted glasses. I had to be the one to ask if we were official, both times. I had to beg for communication, fish into your psyche and find the pieces of our hearts that fit. But for a time, you seemed to enjoy that. You loved me. You told me so everyday. Until you stopped. And those words, when they came, felt emptier than I'd ever heard them. 

You told me you wanted to marry me, have kids with me, that no other woman made you feel the way I did. Then why? Why did you become so cold? When did our love become something for you not to have time for? 

Maybe I relied on you too much, and that's my fault. I know I've always been emotionally needy, clingy and perpetually too much. But, you never made me feel that way, until you did. 

When did our plans become something you stopped dreaming about? I want to ask you this, so badly. I think of you every second. When I wake up, brush my teeth, drink my coffee, shower. I wonder how you are, what you're doing, if you're okay... 

Did you ever have those thoughts about me? 

Finally, after years of begging and pleading, I let you go. I told you we could be friends. But honestly? I don't want to be friends with the man who spent nights with me, discussing the names of our future kids. How can we ever be friends? 

I want the old you back. The one who cared. Whose time I didn't have to fight for. Whose love was mine and mine alone. 

Where did that go? When did you decide that wasn't what you wanted anymore? Why did you stop opening up to me? 

I want to cry almost everyday. It feels like I've lost a limb. But, you see, RBJ, I've spent my whole life chasing after love. From my parents, my friends, my family, society. I don't, no, I won't do that anymore. I won't beg to be enough for you.

Maybe one day you'll tell me what broke between us. Maybe you won't. But in these three weeks without you, I've been breaking and healing, over and over again.

1pes7f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutlawWriter/comments/1pes7f8/the_wren_hills_encounters_part_i/,The Wren Hills Encounters (Part I),"

Something weird is happening here in Wren Hills. The neighborhood has always been quiet until recently. People have been seeing things in their homes. Impossible things. Gigantic spiders layering their floors or snakes squeezing through the faucets of their sinks. A few have reported seeing massive, midnight black dogs roaming outside of their homes, making them feel trapped. My neighbor Carl is one of them. I hadn't experienced anything myself, at that point. Carl says that they found no signs of any dog on his property.

There were no droppings or paw prints in the area he saw the beast and neither the exterior cameras on our houses caught it either. I was asked if I had seen it, but had to confess I hadn't, having slept soundly while my friend Carl was terrified in his own home. The next night there had been more incidents. Mrs. Connelly, the Vice Principal of a nearby school was screaming and running through the neighborhood. That had woken me up, as well as Carl and Bill, the contractor who lived opposite from me.

Apparently Emergency Services were swamped with calls on that night in particular, because it took them a while to get to us after we had managed to calm her down. She claimed that a giant cockroach had chased her from her house a block away. None of us had seen any such thing. No one but the effected had seen any of the other strange things that were reported either, but there were plenty of them. Over the next few nights, things seemed quieter, and I began to think that maybe it had been a strange case of mass hysteria.

I woke a few days ago to a strange sound coming from outside my bedroom window. I was disoriented and dizzy immediately and I knew something was very wrong. That's when I heard it. The scrabbling of massive claws over the floor, and when I looked in that direction, I saw a rat roughly the size of a Pomeranian appear from beneath my dresser. Its eyes were a deep, evil red and its teeth were sharp and cruelly curved. It was joined by another, and another, each squeezing out of what seemed to be an impossible gap.

I knew they weren't real, but couldn't resist the fear I felt in that moment, only spiraling further out of control with each panicked breath. I lost rational thought and didn't come back to my senses until I was sitting on the back bumper of an ambulance. I was outside, and in fact, blocks from my home near a small park. I had been screaming for help, but otherwise hadn't embarrassed myself too much. It was just another night in our formerly quiet little neighborhood. The police had questioned me, but I couldn't tell them any more than the other victims had.

Nothing happened to me the next night, but Carl got another nocturnal visit from the black dog. This time, however, one of my cameras caught something moving in the shadows at the corner of his side yard, but the police didn't seem interested. I put the clip out there online, but mostly got people calling it fake, or offering obviously silly explanations. That next night, I got another visit from the demon rodents and once again fled my own home. This time when I returned, something seemed different about the place. More sinister.

I walked over to Carl's and found him fully clothed, with a steaming mug of strong cup of coffee in one hand. He let me in without any questions or judgement and we talked for a while about our respective experiences, and comforted one another. We went through a pot and a half of the caffeinated beverage before I went back home, and though it still felt hostile, I was determined to stay. Later that afternoon at work is when I heard the news. Old Mr. Harold had went missing. One of my co-workers believed he had wandered off in a state of confusion.

While it was true he was older, he hadn't shown any signs of Alzheimer's or dementia, unless you counted seeing a snake in his bed. His grandson, a student in my English class said that he wasn't sure that was the case when his guidance counselor and I spoke with him before lunch. That night, while I slept undisturbed, Kyle Willner, a soldier in the National Guard vanished as well. He was one of the people who had reported the black dog. Police began patrolling more often, and over the next few days a neighborhood watch was formed.

People had more strange encounters, and a few more went missing in spite of the heightened alert level that everyone was operating under. Carl came over one evening, looking particularly rattled. He wasn't making sense and clearly hadn't slept for more than two days.

“I saw him. I'm next.” the same two statements over and over again on a loop. He only stopped to take in shuddering breaths.

I tried to calm him down for what seemed to me to be hours. I made mint and chamomile tea, and tried to drive the conversation in a new direction and it worked as the sun began to lower behind the hills that gave our area its name. I escorted him to my couch and gave him a pillow and blanket, assuming that we would both feel better and be safer if we stuck together. Imagine my surprise when I woke, dizzy and feeling sick to my stomach, trying to hold it together long enough to get to the living room to check on Carl, when the couch was vacant.

I turned toward the kitchen and that too was empty, barring the small battalion of dog-sized rats that occupied the floor there. I began to scream and fled my home once more, barefoot and wearing only shorts and a tank top. Once again, I lost awareness of my surroundings and time itself. This time when I did come back to reality, it was hard to breathe and the medic put a mask over my face and adjusted the flow of oxygen until it filled my lungs more easily. They took my blood pressure and heart rate as well.

After they finished, I was taken to the police station for questioning, and I got the distinct impression that the detectives suspected that I had done something to my friend. I was told not to leave town, but wasn't held or charged, though I did call in the next day. I didn't feel like being stuck in a room with forty or fifty twelve year olds for eight hours after the ordeal I had just been through. In fact, I fell asleep with the curtains to my room wide open. I woke six hours later with a burning bladder, then, after using the toilet I moved to the window to close the drapes.

That's when I noticed something odd. A small hole in the bottom of the window pane, just beneath where the sheet of glass sat and the wood of the sill. I was distracted from my investigation of it by a knock at my front door. When I opened it, I found two uniformed police officers standing there. I was once again escorted to the police station. They asked me more questions about Carl, and I gave them the same answers as before, having nothing to hide. What shocked me was when they asked me how well I knew Mrs. Connelly.

I told them the truth, we had a cordial relationship at work, and didn't socialize outside of that. I was increasingly getting the feeling that they weren't believing a word I was saying. Once again, though, I was released without charges. I had no experiences that night and returned to work the next day as normal, only to find that adults in Wren Hills weren't the only ones disappearing. Two students had vanished. I felt a slight sense of relief that none of them were in my class. I was still unsettled, and felt for the families, of course, but at least maybe the police would move their gaze off of me.

I found it hard to concentrate that day. The kids seemed too quiet, some of them even appearing to be on the verge of tears. Whispers ran through the hallways. Theories about who could be behind it, or perhaps, even what. Some of the teachers were also indulging in theories. There was a serial killer on the loose, or a curse on the neighborhood. I didn't know what to think, especially after my discovery which I kept to myself. I went about my day as normally as I possibly could and returned home. I rushed from the front door to the window.

I clicked a couple of pictures of the small hole and pulled the card that one of the officers had given me, dialing the number. He answered quickly and agreed to meet with me later that evening. I was allowed to drive myself that time, at least. I showed him the pictures I had taken and when I returned home after a short conversation, a pair of officers followed me to do some investigating of their own. They even went outside and checked the soil there for any signs of a trespasser but seemingly found nothing.

I was more frustrated than before when I went to bed. I woke, feeling dizzy and nauseous again. This time I had the presence of mind to look toward the window. There was a figure there but my blurry eyes couldn't make out any features beyond the brim of a wide hat. I tried to chase after whoever it was, but the rats appeared in that moment. I lost my composure and senses again. This time I came around in the hospital. I was unresponsive by the time the ambulance got to me. I felt better when I opened my eyes to see the unfamiliar ceiling.

'At least I'm not outside.' was my first thought.

I didn't have to wonder where I was, as the soft beeping of the heart monitor had clued me in to that a moment after I had regained consciousness. I waited patiently until the nurse knocked at my door. They genuinely seemed glad to see me awake and coherent, and to be honest, I was too. The doctor was my next visitor.

“How are you feeling?” she asked after performing her initial examination of me.

“You mean overall or right this second?” I didn't mean it sarcastically. The words practically fell out of my mouth, my patience with everything having worn thin.

The doctor took it in stride. Probably checked my notes before coming into the room.

“I mean right now.” came the reply.

“I feel okay. A little frustrated.” I answered with a soft sigh.

“I don't blame you. I have been asking everyone who comes in after an episode like this. Can you tell me what you remember?” the woman pressed, as politely as she could.

“I saw something. A person outside my window. At least I think it was a person.” I admitted after a few minutes of thought. The memories of the encounter with he figure were distorted and faded, like old Kodak photographs.

“A person? Are you sure?” her voice had went up an octave when she spoke, and I got the suspicion that I wasn't the first to make the claim.

“I can't be absolutely positive, but I saw something.” I reiterated.

“If you're up to it, I am sure the police would like to know.” she told me.

I nodded, and she was nice enough to get me a big cup of ice water before leaving me alone. I tried to relax a little bit until there was another knock at the door. One of the officers that stepped inside was one of those that I had spoken with a few times before. He gave me a slight smile and apologized before asking me a bunch of the expected questions. I gave honest answers and soon enough, I was released from the room and on my way home in the back of a cab. I walked inside, feeling even more unsafe than I had before.

I started calling family members and tried to make arrangements for me to come stay with them, but everyone balked. They said my story sounded crazy, even when I pointed them to the articles about the incidents that had not been kept quiet.

“Everyone is just working each other up.” my older brother said, echoing the sentiments of our parents.

I hung up a few minutes later. I tried to settle down and watch a movie that I loved as a teenager, but found it hard to focus. I couldn't eat when I tried. The only people I felt I could talk to had already vanished. I remember tossing and turning for a long time that night, my eyes popping open to glance toward the window. Every odd shadow had me getting up to approach, but I didn't see the figure in the weird hat. At least, not until after I finally managed to fall asleep. I woke with the increasingly familiar sense of dizziness and sickness in the pit of my stomach.

The difference was that this time there was a visible fog in the air, the light from the hallway shimmering on the glittering droplets, and then I saw something else. A living shadow, face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. Small points of sickly orange light hung in the abyss that should have been a face, refracting as if shining outward through the bottom of a drinking glass. My perception tilted and so did my body. My lungs itched and burned. I tried to turn and run, but my feet got entangled with one another.

I fell to the floor and that's when the world went totally black. I don't know how much time passed until my eyes opened again. When they did, I was no longer in my own home. I was in a small, windowless room, laid out on top of a thin mattress, covered with a clean, warm comforter. There was an old style pitcher and small cup. I was uncertain about trying it, but my throat and mouth were far too dry to ignore the liquid for long. I took large drinks at first, and after my body began to feel a little more normal, I took a better look at my surroundings.

There was a doorway that opened onto the room with a toilet and another door that was closed and wouldn't budge when I tried it. I did the only thing I could think of.

This case is about alleged failure to diagnose and treat pulmonary embolism, resulting in the patient’s death.

The patient was a 69-year-old obese male with a history of smoking, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, GERD, elevated lipids, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain on the left side, but no radiating pain. He had been experiencing these symptoms for three days.

Lab tests showed critically low potassium and magnesium. The patient was started on an IV fluids with potassium and magnesium added. The patient’s heart rate was 103 BPM and irregular. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

The hospitalist noted that the patient’s shortness of breath was becoming progressively worse. The patient complained of dizziness and pain in his thigh and shoulder. The hospitalist ordered a CT coronary angiogram and D-dimer. Initially the CT and D-dimer were ordered stat, but then ordered in addition to the routine ED studies. For some reason, the CT was not performed.

The shift ended and the hospitalist went home. The D-dimer was not performed because blood collected in the ED was not adequate for this added test. Since the D-dimer was not ordered stat, it was scheduled for 7:00 AM. The hospitalist did not check on the status of the test before leaving the hospital.

The second hospitalist assumed care at 8:00 PM. The departing hospitalist did not discuss the condition of this critically ill patient during the handoff. The patient appeared to be stable.

At 4:00 AM, a nurse called the hospitalist because of the patient’s elevated respiratory rate. Within 30 minutes, the patient arrested. Another physician responded but was unable to resuscitate the patient. An autopsy confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli.

Plaintiff’s and defense experts were not supportive of the care provided. They criticized the ED physician for not ordering a pulmonary CT scan and diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Although the hospitalist did have pulmonary embolism included under differential diagnosis, experts believed that it was not given a high enough priority, considering that signs and symptoms were consistent with pulmonary embolism. After a history of three days of shortness of breath, leg swelling, chest pain, and atrial fibrillation, the order for lab tests should have been stat. The laboratory should have notified the hospitalist and nurses if they were unable to do the test in addition to the other studies ordered in the ED.

Experts also criticized the quality of the handoff from the first to the second hospitalist regarding this critically ill patient. The first hospitalist did not tell the second hospitalist about the pending D-dimer study.

Experts were mixed in their judgment regarding whether the patient would have experienced a different outcome if clinicians had been more aggressive in diagnosing the patient. Some felt that an earlier diagnosis would have enabled administration of unfractionated heparin, and the patient would have survived. The jury decided in favor of the plaintiffs.

NEXT CASE

This case alleged delay in diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess that resulted in incomplete quadriplegia. The patient was a 49-year-old male with a history of smoking, IV drug abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, hypertension, and chronic pain.

On day one, the patient presented to an outpatient clinic with complaints of headache, neck pain, and sore throat. After the initial assessment, the patient was discharged with instructions to go to an ED if his symptoms became worse.

Three days later, the patient presented to the ED complaining of headache. A CT of the patient’s head was within normal limits. He was given pain medication and discharged.

Ten days later, the patient went to an urgent care center complaining of headache and neck pain that radiated down his back and arms. The patient was sent to the ED, where a lumbar puncture was performed. The spinal fluid had 650 WBCs with 80 percent neutrophils, but no bacteria. Blood cultures were drawn.

The patient was diagnosed with viral meningitis, treated, and discharged. Spinal epidural abscess was included in the differential diagnosis, but the ED physician did not order an MRI.

The next day, blood cultures were reported as positive for staphylococcus. The patient was called at home and admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of staph meningitis and placed on antibiotics. His neurological functions were intact, but the patient continued to complain of headache and photophobia.

The second day of admission, the patient complained of severe neck pain. Even with morphine, the patient was writhing in pain. When called by the nurse, a second hospitalist ordered Dilaudid but did not evaluate the patient.

The third day of hospitalization, a foley catheter was placed for urinary retention. The nurse documented pain in the patient’s neck and legs but did not notify a physician. That evening, a nurse contacted the hospitalist to report that the patient could not move his legs. The hospitalist discontinued the patient’s morphine, instructed the nurse to monitor the patient’s condition but did not go to the patient’s room to evaluate his condition. The night nurse noted the same neurological symptoms but did not notify the hospitalist.

Early the following morning, an attending physician was told about the patient’s condition. He evaluated the patient and called for a stat MRI, which showed cord compression. The patient was immediately transferred to another hospital for surgery.

Surgery was too late. The patient suffered incomplete quadriplegia.

Experts were critical of the care received by the patient. Plaintiffs stated that the ED physician misinterpreted the lumbar puncture, stating that the findings were not consistent with meningitis. He should have ordered an MRI to rule out spinal epidural abscess and should have admitted the patient on antibiotics.

The first hospitalist should have evaluated the patient himself and ordered a CT when the patient experienced urinary retention. The second hospitalist was criticized for failing to evaluate the patient when notified by nurses.

The nurses were criticized for not communicating the urgency of the patient’s symptoms and demanding a physician evaluation when the patient began to exhibit neurological symptoms. When they received no response, they should have followed the chain of command policy to seek help for the patient.

Some defense experts were supportive of some aspects of the care, stating that the patient had an atypical presentation. Other defense experts were not supportive. They stated that the ED physician should have admitted the patient and ordered an MRI, because the patient exhibited classic signs of SEA. They opined that neurological changes should have prompted the first hospitalist to assess the patient and order consultations from infectious disease and neurology. He should have ordered an MRI with gadolinium when the patient developed urinary retention.

This case settled for a large sum.

Spinal epidural abscess was the second-most common missed or delayed diagnosis. Factors that contributed to patient injury in diagnosis-related claims for spinal epidural abscess included delays in ordering diagnostic tests, communication among providers regarding the patient’s condition, and failure to appreciate and reconcile relevant signs, symptoms, and test results. In these cases, symptoms warranted studies to rule out spinal epidural abscess but were not ordered. In some cases, nurses were aware of a patient’s changing neurological status but failed to notify the attending physician. In other cases, the attending physician was aware but failed to take definitive steps to diagnose the problem and timely refer the patient for surgical intervention.

NEXT CASE

A 77-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital for dehydration and bedsores. She had a history of chronic urinary tract infections. The patient was dependent for all activities of daily living.

The hospitalist who admitted the patient ordered medical management and physical therapy. Nurses documented that the patient refused to eat her meals, to get out of bed, or to comply with treatment.

Eventually, the patient’s wounds healed, but nurses continued to chart the patient’s refusal to eat, to get out of bed, or to do physical therapy.

Late on the second day of admission, the patient appeared to be confused and lethargic. The hospitalist ordered a urinalysis with cultures and CBC. The patient’s urine was cloudy, and her WBC was 17.3 with a left shift. The hospitalist ordered a stat chest x-ray and charted early sepsis. The chest x-ray was negative. No medications were ordered.

The next day, the patient was placed in a wheelchair. She refused care and was lethargic. Her blood pressure was 107/68, her temperature was 97, and her oxygen saturation was 91 percent.

The staff left the patient and returned two hours later. They found the patient without a pulse or respiration. The patient had a “do not resuscitate” order, so no measures were taken to resuscitate the patient. The patient’s death was determined to be caused by sepsis.

The patient’s family filed a claim alleging negligent care. They stated that the patient had been left in the wheelchair for too long without supervision by staff. They challenged the hospitalist’s care by stating that he should have ordered antibiotics based on the elevated WBC and left shift. The patient’s confusion and lethargy, with her history of chronic urinary tract infections, should have prompted administration of IV antibiotics. Appropriate care could have prevented urosepsis and death.

Defense experts were supportive, stating that the patient’s vital signs did not suggest sepsis. Also, they pointed out that the elevated WBC could have been due to a nonspecific infection. They agreed with the hospitalist’s decision to order a stat chest x-ray and to wait for the reading before ordering additional medications. Defense experts also pointed to the patient’s healed bedsores as evidence of good care. The case settled.

NEXT CASE

A 79-year-old male presented to the ED with complaints of pain in his left arm and head after falling at home the previous evening. He had a history of dysphagia, GERD, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, hypertension, anemia, DVT, and spinal surgeries. He used oxycodone for chronic pain.

A CT of the patient’s head was negative. X-rays of his arm showed a fracture of the right humerus. The patient’s hemoglobin was 9.2 and his blood pressure was 88/55. Oxygen saturation was 96 percent on two liters of oxygen. The patient was started on IV fluids.

The patient was admitted by the hospitalist, who ordered subcutaneous heparin every eight hours, CBCs every 48 hours, coagulation studies every 24 hours, and morphine as needed for pain. The patient was transferred to a medical/surgical floor with no telemetry ordered.

An orthopedic surgeon was consulted. He recommended conservative treatment with possible surgery after medical assessments were complete. The patient was placed in a sling and treated with pain medication.

Later that afternoon, nurses noted tachycardia with a blood pressure of 73/51. The patient’s pulse was 119. The hospitalist ordered a bolus of fluids, which increased his blood pressure to 87/55.

An hour later, the rapid response team was called because the patient’s blood pressure had dropped, oxygen saturation was 85 percent, and the patient vomited coffee ground emesis. The responding physician ordered Narcan, expecting the cause to be narcotics.

Monitored vital signs showed blood pressures 80–90/55–65. Hemoglobin was reported as 5.6, so the hospitalist discontinued heparin. He ordered more laboratory tests for iron.

The hospitalist conducted a history and physical. His differential diagnosis included GI bleeding. He ordered a GI consultation, noting that the patient’s hemoglobin had dropped significantly in eight hours. The hospitalist documented that the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), but the order to transfer the patient was never written.

Nurses called the hospitalist to report patient complaints of pain and repeat vomiting that still showed coffee ground emesis. The hospitalist ordered morphine, a nasogastric tube, IV fluids, Zofran, vitamin K, and a transfer to the ICU.

Before the patient could be transferred, he became unresponsive. He was resuscitated following a respiratory arrest and transferred to the ICU. A chest x-ray showed worsening infiltrates in the base of the right lung, which was thought to be due to aspiration. The following morning’s chest x-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with a GI bleed, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The following day, the patient expired.

Some plaintiff's and defense experts were not supportive of the assessments and care received by the patient. They criticized the hospitalist for the delayed history and physical, and for not transferring the patient to the ICU. The hospitalist failed to document signs and symptoms of bleeding and inappropriately ordered narcotic pain medications. Despite the patient’s vomiting, the patient’s history of dysphagia did not prompt precautions to prevent aspiration. The GI consult was delayed.

Other defense experts had mixed reviews of the care. They opined that the patient should have been admitted to the ICU due to the likely GI bleeding and aspiration. They criticized the delay in ordering a GI consultation. Their view was that the patient’s problem was not a narcotic overload. The case settled as a result of the critical opinions of the hospitalist’s care.",20,1764932128.0,hospitalist,1,0.89,False

I want it to be the kind of pining, longing. MC1 knows everything about MC2—what he drinks with his coffee, what kind of things he likes to do, what kind of perfume he wears.

They may or may not live in the same place, city, they may have only had one experience together, in which case MC1 never forgot and became obsessed, dreaming about him, writing things about him, drawing pictures of him (if he's an artist). Like, imagine an artist creating works about MC2 and they haven't spoken in years, but all the works are about MC2.

Or like Jesse in {Remember My Name by Rebecca Rathe}, who got a tattoo every year to remember Luc, wrote songs for him, and thought about him all the time when he slept with someone else. Or like in {Flagrant Foul by Jesse H. Reign}, where the two have been longing for each other for so long that it wouldn't be healthy in ""real life."" And MC1 pretends to hate MC2 because he can't have him, so he just pretends to hate him because he can't be around him, but he's obsessed with everything he does.

i am torn between 2 itineraries for my trip to Colombia in february. I will be visiting for 30 days. I arrive to and leave from Bogota

1) Bogota -> Villa de Leyva -> Monpox -> Carthagena -- all by bus; then plane to Medelin or Cali then back to Bogota (this is approximative and i would go places in between those)

In this itinerary i see ncie landscapes, the beach, i visit fincas.



2) Stay in the Bogota - Cali - Medelin circle to visit Tatacoa's desert, Fincas and other places.

  
I am very much torn, what i'd like to do is see nice landscape, see locals, and most of all visit cocoa (and maybe coffee) fincas.

Is going to Carthagena really worth it ??? cause i could go to Villa de Leyva and come back, and nust not go to Carthagena

Literally, you can not move without money.

Is it cold; would you like to turn the heating on? Yeah, let's not do that now; let's do it when it is really cold.

I would really like some coffee; yeah, but I could buy some more essential groceries with that, let's just skip it.

You need to plan everything ahead, manage your time well, and hope to God nothing unaccounted for happens, which it always does: the toaster stops working, the handle of the coffeepot breaks off, your shoe gets torn somehow, you sit on your glasses, etc.

The real richness is being able to buy time. Want to learn a language? You would be great at some sports? Wouldn't it be great to just get away for a while? Work 12 hours, go home, cook, and vacuum the rug, lest entropy engulfs you.

Note that I am not Grapes of Wrath poor. I am fortunate enough. Well, that's debatable. I have two degrees, work at a decent full-time job, do some freelance work, too, whenever I could get a chance, but the pay is so low I can barely pay rent and take myself out. Changing jobs? Market is full of scammers, conditions are awful, and the HR treats applications like it's Tinder. I write, in my own words, without chat-f-gpt, a letter to each one. Not a single reply. And if they do reply at all, they give you a quote, the lowest of their designated limit, the bare minimum, and admire themselves in the mirror having condemned someone to barely eking out a living. More royalists than the king. 

At the end, the condition remains, the hell known is better than the heaven unknown. If you also do not have a socio-economic safety net, you cannot do leap of faiths.

CV attached,"I’m also looking for someone who’d be down to join Hyrox or trail runs with me next year. It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or seasoned runner, as long as you enjoy the challenge and the vibe. If you like staying active and want a partner for races, long runs, or getting lost on mountain trails, then we’re already off to a good start.

Anyways, here’s my story:

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek
Homeland | Urbandub | Rome | Piano | Atomic Habits by James Clear
Before Sunset | Frederic Chopin | Canada | Running | How to think like a Roman Emperor
The Office | Eminem | New York | Cooking | Letters from Stoic
Big Bang Theory | John Mayer | Maldives | Film & Photography | 48 Laws of Power
Breaking Bad | Elton John | Marrakesh | Badminton | The Intelligent Investor

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 12/05/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time if they’re not emotionally ready.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures right away to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",5,1764931865.0,PhR4Dating,1,0.78,False

tl:dr too long don’t read if you can’t be bothered or don’t care about customer lore

I have scanned them to be reprinted and cutout. I use the vouchers everyday since I discovered them. 

Some of the design has changed from last issue but all of the same deals still remain, except three extra-vouchers have been removed. 

That is not an problem with Infinite copies. 

The size is not Identical to the original sheet for these. They will come out slightly smaller. I have matched it to the same size as my other vouchers which is also not an Identical print to the original. This is identical to my other vouchers.

I prefer them to be slightly smaller and to print onto thicker paper. The paper they print them on is painfully thin and so hard to use or even scan. Not their fault but I don’t know why they do it. Go for 120gsm if you’re printing these, and make sure it’s gloss paper.  I will upload the raw pdf aswell so anyone can make edits. 

I scanned this at 600dpi, at A3 size because the paper is too big to scan A4. I will upload like 20 pdfs so anyone can edit it. 

It doesn’t need to be printed. 
Anyone can use these voucher without even having a sheet. You can just ask for any one of these deals from the voucher, you don’t need the sheet. That is your choice if you print.

Alright, sit down, fellow manifestors grab your coffee, water, wine, or emotional-support snack.
This is going to be a long read, and yes, it’s worth every minute, because what you’re about to hear sounds like a Netflix plot mixed with Neville Goddard magic.

Third party?
No contact for almost two years?
Different cities?
Zero movement?
Chaos everywhere?

Perfect ingredients for a manifestation success story.

So buckle up  because what I manifested will either inspire you, shock you, or make you question your entire reality.
Maybe all three



People always ask me how I managed to manifest my SP when everything in the 3D looked completely against me.
There was a third party.
We had zero contact for almost two years.
We lived in different cities.
Every single thing I saw in the 3D was unfavourable.

And yet… I manifested her back exactly the way I imagined.

Here’s how I handled the entire situation.


I Knew One Basic Principle

“My imagination is the only reality.”
Once I truly accepted this, nothing in the outer world had the power to shake me. I stuck to this law like glue.

Whenever I missed my SP, I used imagination not lack, not crying, not overthinking.



How I Used Imagination in Small Moments

One day I was sitting at a bar.
A couple was having sangria and wine, enjoying a romantic date.

Before, I would think:
“I don’t have my SP. I’m alone. My love life is a mess.”

But instead, I imagined me and my SP on that date.
I felt it so real like I was the lucky guy sitting with the love of my life.
I felt it in my imagination, then continued my dinner peacefully.

Another day, I saw a couple hugging on the street.
Instead of feeling sad, I imagined my SP hugging me her in my arms, me kissing her forehead.

One morning I woke up missing her.
Instead of spiralling, I imagined her sleeping next to me, peaceful and safe because she feels loved with me.
Then I continued my day.



How I Handled Negative Thoughts and Unwanted 3D

One day, my SP literally told me:

“I’m dating someone else. It’s not possible for us.”

I had two choices:

1. Take her words seriously, break down, feel hopeless.

2. Ignore it and continue trusting my imagination.


I chose the second.

I smiled and whispered internally:
“Girl, you have no idea… you’re dating me. I am your boyfriend.”

I didn’t argue with her.
I didn’t fight the 3D.
I didn’t try to change her mind.
I just stuck to my story.



Handling Social Media Triggers

She once posted a story holding her boyfriend’s hand.

Instead of getting triggered, I simply imagined:
“That’s my hand she’s holding.”

I denied what my eyes saw.
I denied my senses.
I accepted only the reality I wanted.


Recreating Her Entire Version

In the beginning, she acted very cold one-word replies, no calls, cancelling plans.

I didn’t try to change her behaviour in the 3D.
I changed the version of her in my mind.

I told myself:

“This is not my SP. My SP is loving, she wants to talk to me, she calls me every day. She does this because she loves me. I am the most important person in her life.”

I ignored the current behaviour completely.

On my birthday, she wasn’t with me she was with the third party.
Instead of feeling sad, I imagined her bringing me a cake and celebrating with me.


During No Contact

She moved back to her hometown with her boyfriend.
We lost all communication.

I didn’t feel lack or panic.
I imagined we were together.
I imagined calls, messages, inner conversations.

My favourite scene was:

Picking her up from her apartment, going out for food, dropping her back, and her hugging and kissing me goodbye.

Whenever I missed her, I reminded myself:

“She is my girlfriend. We are together. That’s the fact.”


The Turning Point

After 1.5 years of no contact, at 4:30 AM, I received a call from an unknown number.

It was her.

She said she had moved back to my city and wanted to meet for coffee.

We met.
We started meeting regularly.
Within a week or two, she proposed to me.
We started dating.


The Signs That Shocked Me Later

She moved back to the same apartment I used to imagine picking her up from.
Coincidence? I don’t think so.

We went on a date she ordered sangria, I ordered wine.
Later I realized I had imagined this exact scene years ago in the same bar.

One winter night, she hugged me on the same street where I once saw a couple hugging and imagined it was us.

On Christmas Eve, she held my hand, clicked a picture, and posted it on Instagram.
Years earlier she posted the same picture with her boyfriend and I had imagined it was my hand.

Now it actually was.

Every birthday, she brings me a cake exactly how I imagined when I once celebrated alone.

My entire relationship feels like déjà vu.
Like I lived it in my mind first and am now living it again in physical reality.


What This Taught Me

When you imagine something with inner conviction, it must manifest.

I didn’t try to remove the third party.
I didn’t try to force contact.
I didn’t chase.
I didn’t wait for signs.
I didn’t check tarot or angel numbers.
I didn’t worry about how or when.

I imagined the end and accepted it as done.

The universe took care of the rest.


Most People Complicate It

You waste your energy thinking:

“The 3P is still there.”
“It’s been 4 months since we talked.”
“No movement.”
“No signs.”

In my case, there was zero movement for almost 2 years.
No signs.
No birds-before-land.
Nothing.

Yet everything unfolded exactly as imagined.


So Keep It Simple

Have faith.
Have patience.
Stick to your desired reality.
Ignore the 3D.
Enjoy the journey.

Manifestation is real.
I’ve lived it.
Everything I once imagined showed up exactly as it was in my mind.

So yeah… that’s how I manifested my SP back from another relationship, across cities, through two years of silence, with absolutely no “signs,” no tarot, no angel numbers, and no detective-level stalking skills.

Just imagination.
Just vibes.
Just me minding my own business while the universe did all the heavy lifting.


Anyway, moral of the story:
Use your imagination, not your anxiety.
And if you ever doubt whether this stuff works, remember  I literally manifested my way into a relationship while my SP was off dating someone else.

Now go manifest your love life like the main character you are.
The universe is waiting.",29,1764931572.0,Manifestation,3,0.95,False

Pipes that groan at 3AM, heat that kicks on whenever it feels like it, a laundry room that smells vaguely like somebody spilled soup in 1998 and nobody cleaned it up. The rent is cheap, though. That’s what keeps me here.

Well… that, and the fact that I can’t really afford to move again.

I’ve got one neighbor on my floor that I actually talk to:
Mrs. Eleanor Marsh.
Seventy-something. Quiet. Polite. Always dresses like she’s headed to church even when she’s checking her mail. The kind of elderly woman you’d trust to water your plants when you’re out of town.

She also has a habit of knocking on my door with letters her “late husband” supposedly sends her.

And the weird part?
He’s been dead since 2003.

The first time she asked me to read one aloud, I thought she was confused, or lonely, or maybe she just needed company. The envelope she held was old and soft at the edges, the paper almost sun-faded. But the ink inside? It looked brand new.

And the contents?

That was the moment something in my life shifted — just a few degrees at first, but enough to start feeling wrong.

The letter described my exact routine from the night before. Down to the time I came home. Down to the place I tossed my keys. Down to how long I stood in my kitchen deciding whether to cook or just give up and eat toast. Every detail correct. Too correct.

I tried to play it off, read it in a neutral voice, hand it back politely.
But something in her expression worried me.
Not fear, not confusion — but a kind of hopeful calm, like she believed her husband was still just… writing to her from somewhere.

I told myself it was a fluke.

Until more letters came.


---

Mrs. Marsh knocked again three days later. I opened the door to find her holding another envelope, this one pale blue with a postmark so faded I couldn’t tell what year it was supposed to be from.

She asked me to read it, so I did.

It described what I ate for breakfast.
What shirt I wore to work.
The exact moment I forgot my wallet and had to run back upstairs.

You ever have someone describe your entire day to you in detail you don’t even remember doing? It feels like your life isn’t yours anymore. Like someone’s been living in your shadow.

Every letter got more specific.

The next one mentioned how I talk to myself under my breath when I’m stressed.
Another described the moment I laughed alone at a stupid video at 1AM.
One letter even mentioned I check my apartment lock three times before leaving.

Things no one should know.
Things I barely notice myself.

And every time I read them aloud, Mrs. Marsh would smile gently, as if the words from beyond made something in her chest feel whole again. She’d thank me, fold the letter carefully, and place it in a little box she kept beside her recliner. A box filled with dozens — maybe hundreds — of envelopes.

All written in the same precise handwriting.

Handwriting that did not belong to anyone alive.


---

But yesterday… yesterday changed everything.

She knocked on my door earlier than usual. Maybe a little after six. Her hands trembled when she handed me an envelope — not one of the old, faded ones this time. This one looked almost new. Cleaner. Like it hadn’t aged at all.

And my name was written on it.
Not hers.

“Would you… would you read this one?” she asked. “I don’t understand it.”

I opened it.

The first line made my mouth go dry.

> “He’ll fall asleep uneasily tonight.”



I swallowed hard and kept reading.

> “By 3:27 AM, he will turn onto his left side. Dreams will come slowly. And when they do…”



My heartbeat climbed into my throat.

> “…he will see the room exactly as it is — except he won’t be alone.”



I stopped.
Mrs. Marsh looked at me with wide, watery eyes.

“What does it say?” she whispered.

I didn’t want to tell her.
I really didn’t.

But I read the next part.

> “He will think it’s a dream. But it won’t be. They never are.”
“Tell him not to open his eyes when he feels the bed shift.”



My hands went numb.
The ink looked like it had been written minutes ago.

And the final line?

> “If he opens his eyes, he will finally see who has been writing to you both.”



I folded the letter slowly, trying to keep my voice steady. Mrs. Marsh took a single step back, shaking her head.

“That’s not my husband’s handwriting,” she whispered. “This one… this one feels wrong.”

Before I could say anything, she shut her door. Locked it. Turned off her living room light.

I stood there in the hallway with the letter burning cold in my hand.


---

Last night, I didn’t sleep in my bed. I stayed on my couch with the TV on low, trying to convince myself the whole thing was some elaborate prank. My friends? The building manager? Someone bored enough to mess with me?

But around 3AM, I must’ve drifted.

I wasn’t fully asleep — just barely under, floating somewhere between dream and waking.

That’s when I heard the creak.
From my bedroom.

One slow shift of weight.
Then another.
Closer.
Deliberate.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

Something sat on the bed. The springs dipped. The air pressure in the room changed. A warm exhale brushed the back of my neck even though I wasn’t in the room.

I remembered the letter.

Don’t open your eyes.

I stayed frozen until sunrise.

When I finally checked the bedroom, the sheets were wrinkled. Indented. The kind of indentation a body makes when it sits too long.

As if someone had waited there patiently.

Watching.


---

Ten minutes ago, someone slid an envelope under my door. No knock. No footsteps.

Soft, deliberate, like they knew I was listening.

This one wasn’t addressed to me.

It wasn’t addressed to Mrs. Marsh either.

It just had three words written in that same perfect handwriting:

 “You’re next tonight.”

I didn’t leave my apartment that entire morning. I just sat in the living room staring at the newest envelope, that short warning repeating in my mind like a heartbeat:

You’re next tonight.

I kept trying to explain it away — prank, break-in, hallucination, exhaustion, anything rational — but none of those theories survived more than a few seconds. Because if someone had actually come in here last night, quietly enough to sit on my bed without waking me… I’d be dead already. Or worse.

And if nobody had come in?

Then whatever was here didn’t need the door.

I didn’t want to think about which possibility scared me more.

By noon, I decided I couldn’t stay inside any longer. The walls felt closer by the minute, like the building itself was tightening around me. So I went downstairs, grabbed a coffee from the corner café, and tried to exist like a normal person for a few hours.

But normal doesn’t come easy when your life suddenly feels observed.

Every time someone opened the café door, I flinched. Every time my phone buzzed, I checked if someone had texted me in that same perfect handwriting. Every time I glanced at my reflection in the café window, I half-expected to see a face behind me.

When I finally walked back to the building, Mrs. Marsh was sitting in the lobby. She looked smaller in the overstuffed armchair, like someone had taken the air out of her. Her hands were folded tightly in her lap, knuckles white.

She looked up at me and whispered, “Did you read it?”

I nodded.

Her eyes filled, not with tears — but with guilt.
Real, heavy guilt.

“I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I shouldn’t have involved you.”

“Involved me in what?” I asked, kneeling beside her. “Mrs. Marsh, what exactly is going on with these letters? Who’s sending them?”

She pressed her lips together, thinking hard, as if there were a dozen answers she couldn’t use. Finally she said:

“My husband… Edward… he used to write letters constantly. Every day, every occasion, every thought he had. Even after he got sick, he kept writing. It was his way of holding onto things. Onto me.”

She paused.

“After he died… I kept waiting for the letters to stop.”

I felt a chill slither down my back.

“They didn’t,” she said softly.

“How long?” I asked. “How long have you—”

“Seventeen years,” she whispered. “They never stopped. Not once.”

I stared at her.

Seventeen years.
Almost two decades of letters written in a dead man’s hand.

“Why didn’t you tell anyone?” I asked.

She looked at me the way someone looks at a child asking why the sky is blue.

“Who would believe me?”

Fair point.

Then she leaned closer, her voice dropping to a fragile hush.

“For the first ten years, the letters were about me. My routines. My health. My thoughts. My dreams. Things I never said aloud. I thought… maybe grief was a doorway. Maybe he was writing from wherever he’d gone. I wanted to believe that.”

“And now?” I pressed.

Her expression hardened in a way I’d never seen before.

“Now,” she whispered, “the letters aren’t about me at all. They’re about you.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but she squeezed my hand suddenly — painfully — as her voice cracked.

“Please… don’t go to sleep tonight.”

Back upstairs, I locked my door. Then deadbolted it. Then shoved a chair under the handle. It didn’t make me feel better, but at least it made me feel like I’d tried.

For the first time in my life, I caught myself wishing I owned a gun. Or a dog. Or… something. Anything that might warn me when something invisible decides to sit on my bed.

I turned on every light in the apartment.
Then I dragged a blanket and pillow into the bathroom.

Why the bathroom?
Because it’s the only room without a window.
One way in, one way out.
Easier to defend.

I was halfway through building a makeshift nest in the bathtub when I heard something slide under my front door.

The sound was unmistakable.
The soft, papery whisper of another envelope.

I stared at the bathroom door for a solid ten seconds before forcing myself to move. My chest felt tight, my legs numb. Every instinct screamed don’t look, don’t look, don’t look.

But I did.

I opened my front door just enough to reach down and pick it up.

New envelope.
Clean.
No return address.

This time it wasn’t handwritten.
It was typed.

Black ink.
Perfect alignment.
Too perfect.

On the front was my name in neat print.

I opened it with hands that didn’t feel like mine.

Inside was a single sheet of paper.

I read it once.
Then twice.
Then my knees nearly gave out.

> “You moved to the bathroom. Smart.”
“But don’t bother staying awake.”
“You fall asleep at 2:19 AM no matter where you try to hide.”



My heart stuttered.
I kept reading.

> “When you dream tonight, you’ll finally understand why I write.”
“And why she was never supposed to read my letters.”



I blinked at that line.

She?

Before I could question it further, my phone vibrated.

A text from an unknown number.

No message.
Just a photo.

I opened it.

It was a picture of me.

Asleep.

Not last night.
Not on my couch.
Not anywhere recent.

This was from months ago — I recognized the old bedsheets.
Taken from the foot of my bed.
Taken by someone standing there.

Watching me.

The caption under the photo said:

 “Part 2 is over. Go lie down.”

I didn’t lie down.

Not after a text like that.
Not after seeing a picture taken from the foot of my bed — one I never knew existed, one no normal person could’ve taken without waking me.

I stayed in the bathroom with the lights on, sitting in the bathtub with my knees pulled up, phone gripped so hard my fingers hurt. I kept expecting another envelope to slide under the door.

None did.

But something worse happened.

Around midnight, my bathroom light flickered.

Not once.
Not the little “dying bulb” kind of flicker.

It flickered three times, evenly spaced.
Like a signal.

I froze.

Then — from the living room — I heard it:

A soft, deliberate creak of floorboards.

Slow footsteps.
Not heavy.
Not dragging.

Measured.

As if someone was stepping carefully, gently, knowing exactly where to place their weight to avoid making noise.

It didn’t work.
The apartment settled differently.
The air felt warmer near the bottom of the bathroom door.

Someone… something… was out there with me.

I didn’t breathe for a full minute.

When I finally forced myself to inhale, I whispered under my breath, “This is not happening. This is not happening.”

The footsteps stopped.

Silence swallowed everything.

I waited, fully expecting the door handle to rattle, or the lights to go out again, or for something to appear under the gap in the door. Nothing happened.

Then I heard it.

Something sliding.

Paper.

Right inside the apartment.

Somewhere near my bedroom.

Impossible, I thought. I’m awake. I’m awake. You shouldn’t be able to do this when I’m awake.

But whatever was sending me these letters… wasn’t following rules I understood.


---

Around 3:30 AM, the sounds stopped.
The air settled.
My body felt like it had been wrung out.

I didn’t sleep.
Didn’t dare.

When sunlight finally bled into the cracks of the bathroom door, I pushed it open and stepped carefully into the living room, ready to fight or run or—I don’t know—scream.

No one was there.

But my bedroom door was open.
I knew I had closed it.

And on my bed?

Another envelope.

Not sealed.
Just resting neatly on the comforter like someone had placed it with care.

I approached slowly, each step feeling like a risk.

Inside the envelope was a letter, handwritten again.

Same perfect handwriting.

> “You didn’t sleep. That’s okay.”
“You’ll sleep eventually.”



I swallowed hard.

> “But you’re asking the wrong question.”
‘“Not ‘who is writing.’”
“Ask ‘why I chose you.’”



My hands shook so badly I almost dropped the page.

The next line chilled me deeper than anything yet.

> “You remind me of him.”



I stared at that sentence, reading it again and again until the meaning settled in my bones.

Him?
Her husband?
Edward?

Why the hell would I remind some… entity of a man who’d been dead for nearly two decades?

I kept reading.

> “He wouldn’t listen either.”
“He thought the letters were harmless.”
“He thought I loved him.”
“He didn’t understand what it meant that I could see him even when he slept.”



A chill crept across my spine.

Not a ghost.
Not a stalker.
Something else.

And Mrs. Marsh…
Did she know?
Did she suspect?

I needed answers.

So I headed straight to her apartment.


---

Her door was slightly open.

That alone made my stomach turn. She was careful, paranoid even, always double-locking it. Always checking the peephole twice.

“Mrs. Marsh?” I called out.

No response.

I pushed the door wider.
Her living room was dim, curtains drawn. The box of letters sat open on her coffee table, envelopes spilling out like someone had rifled through them in a panic.

“Mrs. Marsh!” I stepped inside. “It’s me!”

Still nothing.

But then I heard something—
A muffled sound, somewhere deeper inside the apartment.

Not a cry.
Not words.

Breathing.

Unsteady.
Wet.
Ragged.

“Ma’am?” I whispered as I followed the sound.

It came from her bedroom.

The door was cracked open just enough for a sliver of shadow to move across the floor. I pushed it wider—

—and froze.

Mrs. Marsh sat on the edge of her bed, hunched forward, her face buried in her hands. Her shoulders shook with every breath.

She wasn’t crying.

She was laughing.

A low, broken laugh that made my ribs tighten.

“Mrs… Marsh?” I managed.

She turned her head slowly.

Her eyes were red, swollen, exhausted—but her smile was wrong. Too wide. Too tense.

“Did you get your letter?” she whispered.

“I… I did. Are you okay?”

She nodded, still smiling that painful smile.
Then she lifted a trembling hand and pointed behind me.

I didn’t want to turn.

Every part of me screamed not to.

But I did.

There, on her dresser, was a framed photo of her husband—a younger, happier man smiling beside her. I’d seen it before in her living room.

But now…
Something was different.

Inside the frame, tucked behind the glass, was a slip of paper. A piece of letterhead.
Fresh.
Clean.

I stepped closer.

It was another handwritten note.

Only three lines:

> “He’s standing in the doorway.”
“He doesn’t know he’s become part of the letters.”
“Neither did Edward.”



My breath hitched.

I turned slowly back toward the bedroom doorway—
Where I was standing.

The exact spot the letter mentioned.

And Mrs. Marsh’s smile widened as she whispered:

“Don’t you understand? You were never just reading the letters.
You were helping him write new ones.”


---

Behind me, in the hall, something creaked.

A soft, deliberate shift of weight.

The same sound from my apartment.

The same pace.

The same steps.

Right.
Behind.
Me.

I didn’t turn.

I couldn’t.

I just stared into Mrs. Marsh’s trembling, ecstatic smile as she whispered—

“He’s here for Part Three.”

I didn’t turn around.

If I had, I don’t think I’d be alive long enough to regret it.
Whatever stood behind me in Mrs. Marsh’s hallway breathed like it was learning how.
Long, uneven pulls of air, followed by short, curious exhales, like something practicing a human rhythm by imitation rather than instinct.

Mrs. Marsh kept smiling at me from her bed, her fingers digging into the blanket, knuckles white.

“You remind him so much of Edward,” she whispered. “That’s why he chose you.”

Chosen.

That word sunk into my chest with a weight that made it hard to breathe.

“What does he want?” I whispered.

Her smile trembled, but she didn’t answer that.

Instead, she said, “Read the latest letter.”

My throat tightened.

“I don’t—”

“You HAVE to,” she snapped, suddenly harsh. “He’s waiting.”

The presence behind me shifted again.
Not closer — just… adjusting.
Like someone settling into a chair, except the floorboards beneath me flexed in a way that didn’t match the movement.

I reached into my pocket for the envelope I’d found earlier, the one that said I’d finally understand why he writes. My hands were shaking so badly I almost tore the paper in half.

When I unfolded it, something happened that made me swallow hard:

The handwriting wasn’t perfect anymore.

It shook.
Jagged edges.
Unsteady lines.

Like whoever—or whatever—wrote this letter was trembling.

I began reading.

> “I tried to guide him gently.”
“I tried to keep him awake long enough to understand.”



A cold sweat beaded on my back.

> “Edward thought I was a spirit.”
“He thought I was a memory.”
“He thought I loved him.”



I swallowed hard.

Another shift behind me.
A tiny, eager creak.

I kept reading.

> “But I wasn’t writing to warn him.”
“I was writing to prepare him.”



Mrs. Marsh closed her eyes.
She looked like she might faint.
Or laugh.
Or both.

> “Sleep is the doorway.”
“Dreams are the place we meet.”



Something brushed the back of my shirt. Not a grab. Not a pull.
A touch.
Like fingertips tracing an outline.

> “He followed me too far.”
“He stayed too long.”
“I kept pieces of him.”



My stomach sank.

Mrs. Marsh whispered, “I always knew.”

But her voice wasn’t proud.
It was hollow.

> “Now you’re following the same path.”
“You sleep like he did.”
“You breathe like he did.”
“You fear me the way he did.”


I felt myself trembling.

“What are you?” I whispered at the paper.

Mrs. Marsh’s smile dropped.
Her face drained of color as she whispered, “Don’t. Don’t ask him that.”

But it was too late.
The letter already had an answer waiting.

> “I am what comes to those who think no one sees them.”
“I watch the forgotten.”
“I write the unseen.”



The next line was darker.
Heavier.

> “Your life is made of quiet moments.”
“You leave spaces in your days.”
“Spaces I can step into.”



Behind me, a breath shuddered.
Excited.
Close.

I read the final lines.

> “Edward was the first.”
“You are the last.”
“And after tonight, I won’t need to write anymore.”



I exhaled shakily.

“That’s it?” I whispered.

Mrs. Marsh’s eyes filled with tears.
“No,” she croaked. “Turn it over.”

My heart dropped like a stone.

I flipped the page.

Only four words were written on the back:

> “You’re already asleep.”



My vision tilted.
My stomach lurched.
The room warped at the edges like heat rising from asphalt.

No.
No.
I was awake in the bathtub.
I was awake on the couch.
I was awake just minutes ago.

Except…

I couldn’t remember leaving the bathroom.
Couldn’t remember walking down the hall.
Couldn’t remember opening the door to Mrs. Marsh’s apartment.

A cold realization crawled through me like a parasite:

I never left the bathroom.

This—
Everything here—
Was the dream he promised.

Not metaphorically.
Not symbolically.

A real dream.
A place where he could move freely.
Touch things.
Write new letters.

Behind me, the presence leaned close enough for its breath to fog the back of my neck.

The voice wasn’t loud.
It wasn’t growled or monstrous.

It was soft.
Patient.
Familiar.

A whisper shaped by someone who had been practicing speech for a very long time.

“Open your eyes.”

Mrs. Marsh screamed, “DON’T—!”

My body reacted before my brain could stop it.

My eyes opened.

What I saw wasn’t a man.
Wasn’t a creature.
Wasn’t anything that belonged in the waking world.

Somewhere deep inside it were pieces that used to be human — hints of structure, symmetry, memory — but stretched, rewritten, rearranged into something meant for darkness, not daylight.

A shape built of observation.
A face made of everything it had ever watched.
And it leaned in close, studying me with fascination, with hunger, with a strange tenderness.

I didn’t scream.
Couldn’t.

It touched my cheek with careful fingers.

Then it smiled a smile that did not belong to any single person.

“Thank you,” it whispered.
“You read my letters perfectly.”

The dream collapsed in on itself like a punctured lung.

Darkness swallowed everything.


---

I woke up in my bed.

Sunlight pouring through the blinds.

My sheets… perfectly smooth.
No indentations.
No sign anything had ever sat beside me.

For a moment, I convinced myself it was all a nightmare.

Until I rolled over.

And saw the envelope on my pillow.

Pure white.
Uncreased.
Fresh.

My name written in flawless handwriting.

I opened it with numb fingers.

Inside was one sentence:

> “Now you can write them for me.”



And below that…

A second envelope.

Already addressed.

Not to me.
Not to Mrs. Marsh.

But to my neighbor across the hall.

The return address?

Just two words.

That's when I noticed some burning and saw this red patch. Ive tried vaseline again, when i put it on my lips they burn suddenly on that spot, didnt have that before. Otherwise ive tried a calming cream which is called ederma. I can still feel a little bit of burning but it's not as intense as with the vaseline. So far nothings changed and I think the Sriracha is the main reason for that (especially bc it's burning). I expected to see a change in 2 or 3 days but nothing, which at this point worries me.

1perv5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1perv5y/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**Mechanism:**  
Cooling cooked starch should increase resistant starch and reduce glucose spikes.

**What actually happened for me:**  
Pretty similar curves across the board… and the cold potato spiked higher than the fresh one, which I didn't expect. 

Here are the numbers:

**Fresh cooked potato**  
• +2.3 mmol/L rise  
• Back to baseline in \~45 minutes

**Cold potato (cooked then chilled)**  
• +2.5 mmol/L rise  
• Returned to baseline the fastest

**Cooked, cooled, reheated potato**  
• +3.1 mmol/L rise

**Medium McDonald’s fries**  
• +4.4 mmol/L rise  
• Slow peak and slow decline

Not a controlled experiment. This was spread across two days, and I drank coffee, ate 2 normal meals, and spaced the tests by \~3 hours.

The parking lot was really crowded, and after circling around for 5 minutes, my dad decided to just stop somewhere, run in to get the coffee, and then run out. My stepmom went with him and for some reason, they told me to get in the front seat to wait for them. No idea why they would ask me move from the back to the front like that, and I should also mention that I don’t have a driver’s license yet.

Our car was blocking the way and just a few moments after they left, people began getting stuck behind me. They honked their horns at me, and the guy behind got out, banged on the window, and yelled at me to get my “dumbass out of the way and park like a normal person.” I was left in a state of panic, and fumbled with the car controls because I never learned how to drive or start a car, and I rolled very slowly around the parking lot to find a space, which I’m sure irritated everyone even more. I had to park somewhere on the side of the street because I genuinely couldn’t find any space in that lot. The whole time, strangers were honking at me, asking me where I got my license, telling me to watch where I’m going, calling me “idiot” left and right because I was a moving hazard behind the wheel.

My dad and stepmom couldn’t find the car after they picked up their coffee, and had to call me to tell them where I parked, and they had to walk 10 minutes to get to me. My dad asked me why couldn’t I have just waited for 5 minutes and told me I made a very dumb decision in trying to drive when I obviously didn’t know what I was doing. They’re rightfully angry with me because I made them walk all this way when we could have quickly been out of there in a quarter of the time.

First thing it told me:
“Your sleep patterns are trash.”
Thanks buddy, love the honesty.

But jokes aside, the Sleep Patterns Monitoring actually helped me figure out why I wake up tired even after sleeping 8 hours. Turns out I sleep like a confused dolphin at random intervals.

The Circadian Rhythm feature is wild. It literally tells me, “This is your focus window” and “This is your zombie window.” I didn’t know my body followed a schedule… I thought it just winged its way through life like I do.

Then there’s the Caffeine Window. Apparently, drinking coffee at 10 PM is not “quirky behavior,” it’s just me ruining my own sleep. The ring gives nudges like a passive-aggressive friend:
“Maybe don’t drink that right now.”
Fair enough.

The Power Plug features might be my favorite though. It detects irregular signals, early warning signs related to heart health, and basically makes me feel like I have a tiny doctor living on my finger. It also has a Smart Alarm that wakes me up gently instead of attacking me like the normal alarm clock does.

Calories burned vs calories intake? Yeah, it tracks that too.
Now every time I eat biryani, the ring silently watches me like:
“Bold move, champion.”

On the flip side, it’s actually helped me build a genuinely healthier lifestyle. I understand my body signals better, my stress levels make more sense, and I’m finally being a little less chaotic.

I don't particularly care about rhe colors, but as you might notice the handle has this particular shape where it kind of blends into the mug itself.

1perou7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/1perou7/95_relief_after_a_year_of_constant_pain/,95% relief after a year of constant pain,"Over the past year I’ve been dealing with a pretty rough combo: night bruxism, constant muscle tension and pain (I feel it both when I wake up and when I go to bed), a clicking jaw, overall tightness in all jaw muscles, and tinnitus. The headaches were so strong at one point that I honestly struggled to function — even thought about quitting my job.
Worth adding: I also have general sleep issues and anxiety, which definitely didn’t help.

I saw several dentists and a neurologist. As far as I (and the doctors) can tell, most of my symptoms were rooted in neuralgia rather than any structural jaw issue.

Here’s everything I tried, ranked by what helped me the most:

1) Botox

Absolute top in terms of pain relief. I’ve done it twice already and will probably go again. It reduced muscle pain by about 60–70%. I didn’t notice any major changes in my bite or face shape — maybe a tiny bit slimmer, but nothing obvious. It also indirectly helps with night bruxism, probably because the muscles simply can’t clamp down as hard.

2) Exercise (+ cutting caffeine/alcohol/nicotine)

I do 3 strength workouts a week + 5–6 anaerobic sessions. Strengthening the whole muscular system — especially the neck — seems to take a big load off the jaw. Plus it helps a lot with sleep and overall calmness because of the physical fatigue.
Also: reducing stimulants made a huge difference. Cutting coffee down to 1–2 cups instead of my usual 4–5 noticeably reduced muscle tension. Alcohol now maybe once a month (always makes the next day worse), and nicotine to a minimum.

3) Switching to soft pillows

I used to sleep on firm orthopedic pillows mostly on my side. Switching to softer pillows and sleeping on my back — not on my jaw — made my morning pain significantly milder.

4) Hard night guard

A hard splint helped with bruxism and prevented the severe morning pain I’d get with soft guards. I think the soft ones actually made things worse because I would chew on them in my sleep.

5) Cold/hot compresses

Good for temporary relief on bad days. Nothing long-term, but still useful.


What didn’t help (and maybe even made things worse):

1) Antidepressants / tranquillisers

In my case they only made symptoms worse. I think because they deepened my sleep, which increased the intensity of bruxism. Took them for six months, then stopped — and things got noticeably better.

2) Jaw massage / stretching

No idea why, but it consistently made my pain worse. Stopped after a month.


Results
Pain is about 90–95% gone. Tinnitus is much quieter. My sleep is better and I fall asleep faster.
I’m hoping that within the next year I can get rid of the remaining symptoms completely.",5,1764930446.0,TMJ,0,0.86,False

Some look kinda sketchy and some are super expensive. I would prefer something organic. If you drink mushroom coffee, can you tell me, which one actually tastes good?

1perobb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thockfactory/comments/1perobb/thinking_about_ordering/,Thinking about ordering,"Hello gang! I have been out on the market for custom keycaps, and as someone who uses a Swedish ISO keyboard, something like a custom set feels like my only option (I know there are others, but usually I don't like their colors, they feel too ""gamer""-y or they're mono black/white). I have been looking into Yuzu and Thockfactory, and so far I like the Thockfactory editor more, and I would like to support European companies where I can.

I have, however, read a few reviews where they say that the colour fidelity isn't too good, unlike with Yuzu. I don't need it to be exact, but since the one I am making is coffee-themed it has a lot of cream and shades of brown (not close brown, but still browns), along with some images and  I want to make sure it will be of good quality.

I also have a few pictures/pieces of art of a character, how well is their detailed print?

Does anyone here have experience with colour issues or is this issue mostly for the old version and 2.0 is better?",2,1764930388.0,Thockfactory,0,1.0,False
